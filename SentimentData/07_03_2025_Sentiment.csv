The strength and stability of the US dollar, traditionally seen as a safe-haven asset, often influence broader market sentiment, including the crypto space. But what happens when the seemingly unshakable foundation starts to show cracks? According to Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, former President Donald Trump’s policies are sending tremors through the global financial system, potentially threatening the long-standing US dollar dominance . Is Trump’s Legacy Shaking US Dollar Dominance? Donald Trump’s presidency was marked by unconventional economic policies, from trade wars to significant tax cuts. While these policies had domestic impacts, their reverberations are now being felt on the global stage. Nigel Green of deVere Group suggests that these policies, particularly those related to trade and international relations, are contributing to a reassessment of the US dollar’s global reserve currency status. But how exactly are Trump’s policies impacting the dollar’s standing? Trade Wars and Protectionism: Trump’s imposition of tariffs and trade disputes challenged the established global trade order. This ‘America First’ approach strained relationships with key trading partners and raised questions about the US commitment to multilateralism, a cornerstone of the dollar’s global appeal. Increased National Debt: Large tax cuts under Trump, without corresponding spending cuts, led to a significant increase in the US national debt. Sustained high debt levels can erode confidence in a currency’s long-term value. Unpredictability and Geopolitical Uncertainty: Trump’s foreign policy decisions were often characterized by unpredictability, creating geopolitical uncertainty. In times of global instability, investors typically flock to safe-haven assets, but persistent uncertainty can lead to diversification away from even traditional safe havens like the US dollar. The Rise of Alternatives to Global Reserve Currency The concept of a global reserve currency is rooted in convenience and trust. For decades, the US dollar has served this role due to the size and strength of the US economy, its stable political system, and deep, liquid financial markets. However, if trust erodes, or if alternatives become more attractive, the status quo can be challenged. What are these potential alternatives and why are they gaining traction? Euro: The Eurozone represents a significant economic bloc, and the euro is already the second most widely held reserve currency. While the Eurozone has faced its own challenges, its economic size and the euro’s established presence make it a natural contender. Chinese Yuan (Renminbi): China’s growing economic power is undeniable. The yuan’s internationalization, while still ongoing, is steadily increasing. China’s Belt and Road Initiative and its push for cross-border yuan settlements are gradually expanding the yuan’s global footprint. Digital Currencies and CBDCs: The emergence of cryptocurrencies and the development of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) introduce entirely new possibilities. While still nascent, CBDCs, in particular, could offer governments and central banks alternative tools for international trade and reserves, potentially bypassing traditional systems reliant on the US dollar. Gold and other Commodities: In times of currency instability, traditional safe-haven assets like gold often see renewed interest. While not a currency, gold can act as a store of value and a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. deVere Group’s Perspective on Shifting Financial Markets deVere Group , a leading independent financial advisory organization, is closely monitoring these global economic shifts. Nigel Green’s warnings highlight the potential for significant changes in the financial markets landscape. What does this mean for investors, and what are the key takeaways from deVere’s analysis? Diversification is Key: In an environment of uncertainty, diversification across asset classes and currencies becomes even more critical. Relying solely on dollar-denominated assets may expose investors to unnecessary risks. Geopolitical Awareness: Understanding geopolitical trends and their potential economic impacts is crucial. Events like trade tensions, political instability, and shifts in international alliances can significantly affect currency valuations and market sentiment. Adaptability and Agility: Financial markets are dynamic. Investors need to be adaptable and agile, ready to adjust their strategies in response to evolving global conditions. This includes staying informed about macroeconomic trends and policy changes. Consider Alternative Investments: Exploring alternative investments, including cryptocurrencies, could be a way to diversify portfolios and potentially benefit from new opportunities arising from shifts in the global financial order. Navigating the Future of Global Finance: Actionable Insights The potential weakening of US dollar dominance isn’t necessarily a catastrophic event, but rather a sign of a changing global order. For investors, particularly those in the cryptocurrency space, this shift presents both challenges and opportunities. What actionable steps can you take to navigate this evolving landscape? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of global economic news, geopolitical developments, and policy changes from major economies. Reliable financial news sources and expert analysis are invaluable. Reassess Portfolio Allocation: Review your investment portfolio and consider whether your currency exposure is appropriately diversified. Are you overly reliant on dollar-denominated assets? Explore Crypto’s Role: Consider the potential role of cryptocurrencies in a diversified portfolio. Some cryptocurrencies are seen as uncorrelated assets and potential hedges against traditional market volatility and currency devaluation. Seek Professional Advice: Consult with a qualified financial advisor who understands global macro trends and can help you tailor a strategy to your individual circumstances and risk tolerance. Conclusion: A Paradigm Shift in Global Finance? The era of unquestioned US dollar dominance may be facing its most significant challenge in decades. Trump’s policies, coupled with the rise of alternative economic powers and the emergence of new financial technologies, are creating a more multipolar and potentially less dollar-centric global financial system. While the dollar is unlikely to disappear overnight, investors should be prepared for a world where its influence may gradually diminish. Understanding these shifts and proactively adapting investment strategies will be crucial for navigating the future of global finance and capitalizing on emerging opportunities.

Pond.fun, a platform built on Linea, lost 64.8 Ether in what appears to be an attack from within. The stolen funds, worth around $230,000 at current prices, were funneled through a privacy tool designed to obscure blockchain transactions. Lead Engineer Accused Of Exploiting Access According to reports, Genesis, the project’s lead software engineer, was the brains behind the attack. He drained liquidity pools using his privileged access, then sent the money via Railgun, a service that helps conceal blockchain activity, according to Pond.fun. While many users employ Railgun to safeguard their financial privacy, hackers are also using it to hide their activities.

41256957,https://timestabloid.com/?p=59479,1741305610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple Price Prediction: XRP To 30? Ripple Goes Parabolic After Trump Announcement,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-price-prediction-xrp-to-30-ripple-goes-parabolic-after-trump/,"XRP’s explosive 240% surge has sparked bold predictions of a $30 price target. Investors are hopeful, with Trump’s crypto-friendly stance and Ripple’s growing institutional ties fueling speculation. However, regulatory uncertainty and competition cast doubt on whether XRP can sustain its rally. Meanwhile, StratoVM ($SVM) could steal the attention with a staggering 6,223% growth in just two weeks. As a Bitcoin Layer 2, it could introduce smart contracts, DeFi, and AI applications, potentially bridging the gap between Bitcoin’s security and Ethereum’s functionality. Ripple Price Prediction: Is a $30 Price Target Realistic or Just Hype? XRP has experienced a remarkable surge, climbing approximately 240% year-to-date, largely due to optimism surrounding President Donald Trump’s election and the anticipation of a more favorable regulatory environment for digital assets. This bullish trend has led to discussions about XRP’s potential to reach the $30 mark. Analysts point to Ripple’s expanding institutional partnerships and the introduction of the RLUSD stablecoin as factors that could drive XRP’s value higher. On that same note, experts at Coingape foresee that XRP really could reach its 30$ target in 2025. The prediction is further bolstered by Donald Trump’s recent announcement to include US-issued assets like XRP in the Strategic Reserve assets. Trump’s close ties with Ripple officials have fueled optimism among investors. It is also evident by the recent buying trend of the Ripple whales . However, despite these positive developments, XRP’s current price remains significantly below the ambitious $30 target. Market volatility, regulatory challenges, and competition from other cryptocurrencies present substantial hurdles. While the future holds promise, investors should approach such optimistic projections with caution, considering both the potential rewards and inherent risks associated with the cryptocurrency market. Can StratoVM Unlock Bitcoin’s Full Potential? This Layer 2 Solution Thinks It’s Possible Bitcoin has long been the most valuable cryptocurrency, yet its inability to support smart contracts, DeFi, and AI applications has left it lagging behind newer blockchain ecosystems. StratoVM ($SVM) could change that with a Layer 2 solution designed to unlock Bitcoin’s full potential. With a staggering 6223% price surge in just two weeks, according to CoinGecko , StratoVM is proving that demand for Bitcoin-based DeFi is real. For comparison, CoreDAO (another Bitcoin Layer-2) is valued at $990 million, while StratoVM sits at $3.7 million, suggesting plenty of room for future growth. Its technology could enable the seamless integration of smart contracts, meme tokens, and AI applications, potentially combining Bitcoin’s security with Ethereum’s flexibility through EVM compatibility. Developers can now migrate their Ethereum-based projects to Bitcoin, fueling innovation within the ecosystem. SVM 7-day chart, Source: CoinGecko StratoVM’s testnet is already delivering impressive results—processing 56,000 transactions daily and boasting over 113,000 registered wallets. With BTCFi’s total value locked skyrocketing from $307 million to $6.6 billion in a year, according to DeFiLlama , StratoVM could be well-positioned to capitalize on this booming sector. The project’s momentum is undeniable. Over 50 strategic partnerships, nearly 100,000 community members on platforms like X , Telegram , and Discord , and a potential centralized exchange listing are fueling its rapid adoption. Its integration with UniSwap has already increased accessibility, potentially drawing attention from both whales and developers. As Bitcoin evolves beyond being just “digital gold,” StratoVM could play a key role in its transformation. With its mainnet launch approaching, this project might become one of the biggest disruptors in Bitcoin’s history. Final Words XRP’s great year has investors wondering if $30 is within reach, but uncertainty looms. Trump’s support and institutional adoption fuel optimism, yet regulatory hurdles and competition create challenges. Meanwhile, StratoVM could gain more attention with an impressive 6,223% surge. As Bitcoin struggles to support DeFi and smart contracts, StratoVM could appear as a potential game-changer. Remember, this article is not financial or trading advice.

As Cardano grapples with declining retail interest and struggles to hold support at $0.67, and the SUI price shows signs of a potential rally to $16, investors are on the lookout for the next big opportunity. While both Cardano and SUI offer mixed signals, top-performing crypto Web3Bay is quietly building momentum with an impressive presale performance and significant growth potential. Web3Bay’s presale has already raised over $1.6 million, offering early participants the chance to buy 3BAY tokens at $0.00524. Experts predict the launch price could reach $0.1959, delivering a staggering 6,430% ROI. With limited presale opportunities left, the clock is ticking to get in early. Why Web3Bay Could Be the Next Top Performing Crypto of 2025 Web3Bay is making a name for itself with a presale that has raised over $1.6 million and sold 390 million tokens at $0.00524. The platform offers a practical solution to e-commerce challenges by eliminating intermediaries, reducing fees, and supporting both crypto and traditional payment methods like PayPal. Experts predict the token could launch at $0.1959, offering an incredible 6,430% ROI for early backers. In contrast to Cardano, which faces challenges with retail engagement, and SUI, which is heavily dependent on hitting its ambitious price targets, Web3Bay offers immediate and tangible benefits. These include staking rewards, governance rights, and discounts on its decentralized marketplace. This combination of strong ROI potential and practical utility is creating a sense of urgency around Web3Bay’s presale. The presale’s structure also adds to its appeal, with a 15% price increase at each phase. At the projected launch price, a $1,000 investment now could potentially turn into $42,939. This makes Web3Bay not only an attractive opportunity but possibly the best chance to secure a position before it hits the market. Cardano Struggles to Break Key Levels Cardano started 2025 on a challenging note, with its price hovering around $0.67, reflecting a 29.9% drop over the past month. Despite launching new initiatives like the “Cardano Buidler Fest #2” and proposing governance changes through the Plomin hard fork, market sentiment remains bearish. The sharp decline in active addresses to just 24,407 underscores the fading retail interest. Key support at $0.5928 and resistance at $0.6793 could determine ADA’s short-term direction. While Cardano is still focused on long-term development, including partnerships with corporations like Petrobras, its current market performance is underwhelming. Without a significant boost in retail engagement, Cardano might find it difficult to compete against more dynamic networks like SUI and Web3Bay. SUI Price Shows Strength with Potential for 326% Rally Unlike Cardano, the SUI price is holding strong at around $4.10, with analysts predicting a potential rally to $16 by the end of 2025. Technical indicators suggest a 30% short-term rally, with solid support around $4.00 and resistance at $4.67. Increased open interest and growing social dominance further enhance its bullish outlook, positioning SUI as a top performing crypto this year. SUI’s ecosystem is expanding with significant updates, including its integration with Wrapped Bitcoin via the Sui Bridge, contributing to an 8.5% price increase. The network has also surpassed $2 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL), demonstrating strong market participation and community support. As other networks like Cardano struggle, SUI’s robust fundamentals and technical setup make it a promising contender for growth. Summing Up Cardano is struggling to regain momentum, with its price stuck around $0.67 and a decline in active addresses adding to the bearish outlook. Meanwhile, the SUI price is showing strength, trading at approximately $4.10 with the potential to reach $16 by the end of 2025. SUI’s expanding ecosystem and strong technicals position it as a top performing crypto for the year. But with both Cardano and SUI price presenting mixed signals, Web3Bay stands out as a compelling option. Its presale has raised over $1.6 million, selling 390 million tokens at $0.00524, with experts predicting a 6,430% ROI upon launch. As opportunities to join the presale narrow, the chance to secure a position in this potential 2025 breakout star is now.

That’s the vision of Faireez, a groundbreaking startup emerging from stealth mode with a powerful $7.5 million seed funding injection. They’re not just cleaning homes; they’re leveraging the astonishing power of AI to redefine multifamily living, offering a service that feels like a five-star hotel amenity right in your condo building. Let’s dive into how Faireez is poised to transform the chore landscape. Unveiling Faireez: The AI Housekeeping Revolution for Condo Residents Founded in 2023 and based in the bustling heart of New York, Faireez is on a mission to elevate the standard of cleanliness in multifamily buildings. Forget generic cleaning services; Faireez is all about personalization. Their subscription model assigns a dedicated ‘fairy’ – a consistent housekeeper – to each building, ensuring residents receive truly personalized and reliable service. Think of it as your own personal cleaning concierge, just a few taps away on their website or app. What sets Faireez apart? It’s their task-based booking system. Instead of estimating hours, residents select specific chores – daily dishwashing, weekly floor mopping, and more. This transparent approach ensures you pay only for what you need, making smart home cleaning accessible and efficient. PropTech Funding Fuels AI-Driven Innovation While co-founders Omer Agiv and Ori Fingerer are keeping revenue figures close to their chests, their partnerships speak volumes. Faireez has already forged “relationships” with top-tier property management companies and landlords across four states – New York, New Jersey, Florida, and Illinois. These aren’t just any names; we’re talking about industry giants like Silverstein Properties, Charney Companies, and First Service Residential, collectively managing approximately 1 million multifamily units. This impressive traction, combined with the $7.5 million seed funding led by Aristagora VC, underscores the immense potential investors see in Faireez’s vision to revolutionize the condo cleaning service market. The AI Advantage: Transforming Housekeeping with Technology Faireez isn’t just another cleaning service; it’s a tech company at its core, deeply integrating AI housekeeping solutions into its operations. Here’s how they’re leveraging artificial intelligence to create a superior cleaning experience: AI-Powered Auto Scan: Coming later this year, this feature analyzes home videos to craft bespoke cleaning plans. Imagine dynamic pricing based on the actual tasks needed, turning housekeeping into a SKU-based service where every chore has a price tag. Pricing will even adapt to supply and demand, ensuring fairness and efficiency. AI Quality Assurance: Every cleaning visit is meticulously documented with time-stamped before-and-after photos. AI analyzes these images for quality control, ensuring consistency and high standards. Real-time notifications keep residents in the loop, providing peace of mind. Robotic Companions: Looking ahead, Faireez plans to introduce robotic assistants to aid fairies with basic chores. This innovative approach could involve remote operation from locations like Mexico, further enhancing efficiency and scalability. Elevating Housekeepers: Fair Wages and Advanced Tools Faireez partners with established professional cleaning companies, handpicking the top 5% of their employees to become ‘fairies.’ These select individuals receive Faireez protocols, uniforms, and equipment, ensuring a consistent and professional service. Crucially, Faireez claims to pay these fairies 30% to 40% above the market average, alongside bonus opportunities, recognizing and rewarding their crucial role. “The same fairy comes every time, so that builds an element of trust,” explains co-founder Agiv. “And we use an AI-based image engine to make sure that the chores are performed the same way every time. Consistency is very important.” Ambitious Goals and Proven Track Record Faireez has set an ambitious goal: to service one million multifamily units by 2030. With current operations in four states and plans to expand to four more by 2026, focusing on the West Coast next, this vision is rapidly taking shape. This isn’t the founders’ first rodeo either. Agiv and Fingerer previously founded WeissBeerger, an Israeli data company for the beer industry, which sold to Anheuser-Busch for a cool $80 million in 2018. Their history of success in bringing high-tech solutions to traditional industries positions Faireez for significant growth and impact in the automated cleaning sector. Investor Confidence in a Blue Ocean Opportunity Moshe Sarfati, managing partner at Aristagora VC, perfectly encapsulates the excitement around Faireez: “Basically they have what it takes to be a game changer in this ‘blue ocean space of residential buildings’ amenities.” Investors clearly believe Faireez is not just cleaning homes; they are cleaning up in a market ripe for disruption. The combination of PropTech funding , AI innovation, and a focus on personalized service makes Faireez a startup to watch in the evolving landscape of residential amenities. Looking Ahead: The Future of Home Chores? Faireez’s emergence signifies a significant shift in how we think about home cleaning. By blending AI with personalized service and fair labor practices, they are not just making homes cleaner; they are potentially freeing up valuable time for residents and setting a new standard for the industry. As they continue to expand and refine their AI-powered platform, the future of smart home cleaning looks brighter and more efficient than ever before.

The search engine known for its staunch privacy stance is pushing further into the realm of Generative AI, making advanced AI tools more accessible without compromising user data. This shift marks a significant evolution in how we interact with search engines, promising a future where powerful AI assistance and privacy go hand-in-hand. Let’s dive into the exciting developments at DuckDuckGo and explore what this means for you. What’s New with DuckDuckGo AI Chat and Generative AI? DuckDuckGo has been subtly weaving AI into its services for a while now, but recent announcements signal a major acceleration. Their AI Chatbot interface, initially launched in beta as ‘DuckDuckGo AI Chat,’ has officially graduated to become simply Duck.ai . This streamlined name reflects a more mature and integrated AI offering. But the changes go beyond just a name change. DuckDuckGo is also significantly expanding the role of Generative AI within its core search engine at duckduckgo.com , bringing AI-powered summaries directly to your regular search results. Duck.ai: Your Private AI Chatbot Arena Imagine accessing the power of cutting-edge AI models from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Meta, all within a privacy-first environment. That’s precisely what Duck.ai offers. This AI Chatbot isn’t just another chatbot; it’s your portal to conversational search powered by the giants of AI, without the privacy strings attached. Here’s what makes Duck.ai stand out: Diverse AI Models: Tap into a range of powerful models including OpenAI’s o3-mini, Meta’s Llama 3.3, and Mistral’s Small 3, ensuring you get the best AI response for your query. Conversational Search: Forget rigid keyword searches. Duck.ai understands natural language, allowing you to ask questions in a conversational style and receive AI-generated answers, not just a list of links. Privacy-Focused: DuckDuckGo emphasizes that Duck.ai allows you to leverage these AI models without being tracked. Your chats are anonymized and never used for AI model training, maintaining your privacy. Free Access (for now): Currently, Duck.ai is free to use, albeit with a daily query limit. DuckDuckGo is considering a paid plan for higher limits and access to even more advanced models. Generative AI in DuckDuckGo Search: A Smarter Search Experience? Beyond Duck.ai, DuckDuckGo is embedding Generative AI more deeply into its traditional search engine. You’ll now encounter AI-assisted answers, in the form of text summaries, appearing above the usual blue links more frequently. According to DuckDuckGo, these AI summaries will appear in over 20% of searches if you choose the ‘often’ setting. This move signifies a significant shift towards AI-enhanced search results, aiming to provide quicker, more direct answers to your queries. Your Privacy, Your Choice: Controlling AI in Your Search While embracing AI Search enhancements, DuckDuckGo remains committed to user agency. You are in control of how much AI influence you want in your search experience. DuckDuckGo offers different frequency settings for AI-generated answers: Sometimes (Default): AI answers appear occasionally. Often: AI answers appear more frequently (over 20% of the time). On-demand: AI answers are available when you specifically request them. Never: Completely disables AI-generated answers in search results. This granular control ensures that you can tailor your search experience to your comfort level with AI assistance. Why is DuckDuckGo Leaning into AI Now? The surge in Generative AI is reshaping the digital landscape, and search engines are at the forefront of this transformation. Google, the dominant search engine, has been rapidly integrating AI into its search results following the explosive popularity of ChatGPT. DuckDuckGo’s move is a clear response to these industry shifts, aiming to stay competitive and relevant in an AI-first world. The DuckDuckGo Privacy Advantage in the AI Era In a market dominated by tech giants, DuckDuckGo’s unique selling proposition remains privacy. They are leveraging this strength to offer a compelling alternative in the AI space. DuckDuckGo argues that it provides access to powerful AI Search tools with reduced privacy risks. You don’t need to create accounts with AI providers to use Duck.ai, and your interactions are anonymized. This is a significant differentiator, especially for privacy-conscious users. Key Privacy Points of Duck.ai: Anonymized Chats: Your chats are proxied and anonymized, preventing them from being directly linked to you. No Training Data: Duck.ai chats are explicitly not used for training AI models, ensuring your conversations don’t contribute to broader AI development in a way that could compromise your data. Local Chat History (Optional): Duck.ai offers a ‘Recent Chats’ feature, but it stores conversations locally on your device, not on DuckDuckGo’s servers, and you can disable this feature entirely. Data Deletion Agreements: DuckDuckGo has agreements with AI model providers to ensure any temporarily saved chats are deleted within 30 days. Seamlessly Switching Between Traditional Search and AI Chat DuckDuckGo is also making it incredibly easy to move between traditional search and AI Chatbot modes. A chat button within the search engine interface allows you to instantly jump to Duck.ai, with your search query pre-filled in the chat prompt. This bi-directional integration allows for a fluid workflow, letting you choose the best approach for each search task. Whether you prefer starting with a conversational AI interaction or traditional search results, DuckDuckGo offers a flexible and integrated experience. Embracing the Best of Both Worlds: AI and Traditional Search DuckDuckGo recognizes that different search needs call for different approaches. Some queries are better suited for the rapid, summary-style answers of AI Search , while others benefit from the in-depth exploration offered by traditional search results. By offering both seamlessly integrated, DuckDuckGo aims to cater to a wider range of user preferences and search styles. And for those who prefer to avoid AI altogether, the ‘never’ option ensures complete control. Expanded Sources and Transparency Initially relying primarily on Wikipedia for AI-assisted answers, DuckDuckGo has broadened its sources to include information from across the web. They also provide “prominent source links” alongside AI answers, enhancing transparency and allowing users to delve deeper into the information underpinning the AI-generated summaries. This commitment to source attribution is crucial for building trust and ensuring users can verify the information provided by AI. Conclusion: DuckDuckGo’s Bold Leap into the Future of Private AI Search DuckDuckGo’s latest moves represent a significant step forward in making Generative AI accessible in a privacy-respecting manner. By enhancing both its dedicated AI Chatbot (Duck.ai) and its traditional search engine with AI capabilities, DuckDuckGo is positioning itself as a leader in the evolving landscape of AI Search . For users who value privacy but also want to leverage the power of AI, DuckDuckGo’s approach offers a compelling and increasingly feature-rich alternative. As AI Chatbot technology continues to advance, DuckDuckGo’s commitment to user agency and data protection sets it apart in a competitive market. The future of search is here, and DuckDuckGo is ensuring privacy remains a central pillar.

US Waives USMCA Tariffs on Mexico, Igniting Global Trade Optimism",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/usmca-tariffs-mexico-trade/,"In a move that has sparked optimism across global trade sectors, the United States has announced a temporary waiver of tariffs on goods from Mexico under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). This significant decision, revealed following a crucial meeting between U.S. officials and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, offers a window of tariff relief until April 2nd. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors closely monitoring global economic shifts, this development could signal potential ripples across markets. Let’s delve into what this tariff waiver means and how it could influence the broader economic landscape. Decoding the USMCA Tariff Waiver: What’s Happening? The announcement, initially reported by Aggr News via X, confirms that the U.S. will temporarily suspend tariffs on Mexican imports within the framework of the USMCA agreement. This decision comes after high-level discussions with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, suggesting a renewed focus on strengthening bilateral trade relations. But what exactly does a tariff waiver entail? Temporary Suspension: The waiver is not permanent; it is currently slated to last until April 2nd. This temporary nature suggests a strategic pause, possibly to assess the broader economic impact or to facilitate ongoing negotiations. USMCA Framework: The waiver operates within the USMCA, a trade agreement designed to foster free trade among the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. This context is crucial as it highlights the importance of regional trade partnerships. Post-Meeting Decision: The timing of the announcement, immediately following a meeting with President Sheinbaum, underscores the diplomatic efforts and discussions that preceded this decision. To understand the significance, let’s briefly look at what USMCA is and why tariffs are relevant in this context. The USMCA, which replaced NAFTA, aims to eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers between the three North American nations. Tariffs are essentially taxes imposed on imported goods, often used to protect domestic industries or as a tool in international trade negotiations. Waiving these USMCA tariffs can have profound effects on trade flows and economic activity. Why Waive Tariffs Now? Exploring the Potential Benefits The decision to waive tariffs, even temporarily, is likely driven by a combination of economic and political factors. What are the potential benefits of this move, and why might the U.S. be choosing this path? Easing Trade Tensions: Tariffs can often be a point of contention in international relations. Waiving them can be seen as a gesture of goodwill, potentially easing trade tensions and fostering a more cooperative environment between the U.S. and Mexico. Boosting Trade Flows: By removing tariffs, the cost of goods traded between the U.S. and Mexico decreases. This can lead to increased trade volumes, benefiting businesses in both countries. More robust Mexico trade is generally seen as a positive economic indicator. Economic Stimulus: Increased trade can act as a stimulus to economic growth. Lower costs for businesses can translate to lower prices for consumers and increased profitability for companies, potentially spurring investment and job creation. Supply Chain Resilience: In a world increasingly focused on supply chain resilience, smoother trade flows with neighboring countries like Mexico can enhance the stability and reliability of supply chains for U.S. businesses. Diplomatic Gains: Waiving tariffs after meeting with President Sheinbaum can strengthen diplomatic ties and build trust, which can be valuable in addressing other bilateral and regional issues. For those in the cryptocurrency space, these broader economic benefits can indirectly impact market sentiment. A stronger, more stable global trade environment often translates to increased investor confidence, which can, in turn, positively influence various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Navigating the Challenges: Potential Downsides and Considerations While the tariff waiver presents numerous potential benefits, it’s crucial to also consider potential challenges and downsides. What are some of the concerns or considerations that might accompany this decision? Temporary Nature: The waiver is only until April 2nd. This short timeframe introduces uncertainty. Businesses need clarity and predictability for long-term planning, and a temporary waiver might not provide sufficient reassurance. Impact on Domestic Industries: Tariffs are sometimes used to protect domestic industries from foreign competition. Waiving tariffs could, in theory, put some U.S. industries at a disadvantage if Mexican imports become significantly cheaper. However, within the USMCA framework, this is likely to be carefully balanced. Geopolitical Factors: International trade decisions are rarely purely economic. Geopolitical considerations, such as broader U.S.-Mexico relations, immigration policies, and regional stability, likely play a role. Changes in these areas could influence future tariff policies. Market Volatility: While increased trade is generally positive, sudden shifts in trade policy can sometimes introduce short-term market volatility as businesses and investors adjust to the new landscape. Enforcement and Compliance: Even with a waiver, ensuring compliance with trade agreements and preventing unfair trade practices remains essential. Robust mechanisms for monitoring and enforcement are necessary to realize the intended benefits. For cryptocurrency markets, any significant economic policy shift can introduce volatility. Traders and investors should remain vigilant and monitor market reactions to this USMCA tariffs impact news. Real-World Examples: How Tariff Waivers Have Played Out To better understand the potential effects of this tariff waiver , let’s look at some historical examples of tariff reductions or waivers and their outcomes: Example Context Outcome Post-WWII Tariff Reductions (GATT/WTO) Gradual reduction of tariffs globally under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and later the World Trade Organization (WTO). Significant increase in global trade, economic growth, and interconnectedness. Lower consumer prices in many sectors. EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement Elimination of tariffs on most goods traded between the European Union and South Korea. Substantial growth in trade volume between the EU and South Korea. Increased competitiveness for businesses in both regions. Temporary Tariff Suspensions (Various Countries) Countries often temporarily suspend tariffs on specific goods during times of shortage or economic stress. Immediate relief to consumers and industries reliant on the tariffed goods. Can help stabilize prices and supply chains in the short term. These examples illustrate that tariff waivers and reductions, when implemented strategically, can lead to positive outcomes in terms of trade growth and economic benefits. However, the temporary nature of the current USMCA waiver means its long-term impact will depend on future policy decisions. Actionable Insights: What Should Businesses and Investors Do? Given this development, what are some actionable insights for businesses and investors, particularly those in the cryptocurrency and broader financial markets? Monitor Trade Data: Keep a close watch on trade data between the U.S. and Mexico in the coming months. Increased trade volumes will be a key indicator of the waiver’s effectiveness. Assess Supply Chain Impacts: Businesses with supply chains that involve Mexico should assess how this waiver might reduce costs or improve efficiency. Explore opportunities to strengthen these links. Evaluate Market Sentiment: Gauge market sentiment in both traditional and cryptocurrency markets. Positive reactions to the news could present trading or investment opportunities. Stay Informed on Policy: This is a temporary waiver. Stay informed about future trade policy announcements and discussions between the U.S. and Mexico. Long-term policy direction is crucial. Diversify Risk: As always, diversification remains a key strategy. While positive trade developments are encouraging, economic and political landscapes can shift rapidly. Diversification across asset classes and geographies is prudent. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope for Global Trade? The U.S. decision to waive USMCA tariffs on Mexico until April 2nd is a noteworthy development in the realm of global trade. It signals a potential easing of trade tensions and a renewed focus on fostering stronger economic ties within North America. While the temporary nature of the waiver introduces some uncertainty, the potential benefits in terms of increased global trade , economic stimulus, and improved diplomatic relations are significant. For the cryptocurrency market and the broader financial world, this news offers a glimmer of hope amidst ongoing economic complexities. The coming months will be crucial in observing the real-world impacts of this policy shift and understanding the direction of future trade relations. This move could be a stepping stone towards more stable and prosperous Mexico trade relations, benefiting both economies and potentially contributing to a more positive global economic outlook.

US President Donald Trump Signs Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Executive Order,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/breaking-we-are-witnessing-a-historic-moment-us-president-donald-trump-signs-bitcoin-strategic-reserve-executive-order/,"According to the latest information, US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the US. However, the reserve will not acquire Bitcoin other than those seized by the government. Details were conveyed by US cryptocurrency chief David Sacks via X. Sacks noted that the reserve would be funded by Bitcoins seized by the federal government through criminal or civil asset forfeiture, and therefore would not impose any additional cost on taxpayers. According to current estimates, the U.S. government owns about 200,000 Bitcoins, but a full audit of these assets has never been done before. The new decree calls for a comprehensive accounting of the federal government’s digital assets. Bitcoins in the reserve will not be sold and will be held as a store of value, likening the reserve to a digital Fort Knox for cryptocurrencies dubbed “digital gold.” Sacks stated that early Bitcoin sales cost US taxpayers over $17 billion in value losses and that with this new strategy, the government aims to maximize the value of its assets. In addition, the Treasury and Commerce Departments were given the authority to develop budget-neutral strategies that do not impose additional costs on American taxpayers. The executive order also includes the creation of a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, comprised of digital assets other than Bitcoin seized through criminal or civil proceedings. The government will not acquire additional assets for this stockpile outside of forfeiture proceedings, and the purpose of the stockpile will be responsible stewardship of government digital assets under the Treasury Department. Sacks emphasized that President Trump fulfilled his promises to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile, underlining his commitment to making the US the “crypto capital of the world” with this executive order. He also thanked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Task Force Executive Director Bo Hines for their support. *This is not investment advice.

Traders Deploy $150M Leverage after Ripple CEO’s White House Invite Confirmation,https://coingape.com/markets/xrp-price-forecast-traders-ripple-ceo-white-house-summit/,"Ripple (XRP) price soared to $2.70 on Thursday, surging 19% in 24 hours as investors responded to U.S. trade tariff updates and rising anticipation ahead of the White House Crypto Summit on March 7. With XRP bulls maintaining dominance in derivatives markets, leveraged long positions now total $150 million, signaling continued upside potential. Ripple (XRP) Outperforms Bitcoin and Ethereum Ahead of White House Crypto Summit XRP faced stiff resistance at the $3 level after Trump’s announced the strategic crypto reserve on March. However, renewed volatility from shifting U.S. trade policies has strengthened bullish sentiment leading into the summit. If momentum persists, XRP could challenge long-term resistance above $3. Ripple (XRP) Price Action The latest market data indicates a strong influx of buyers, propelling XRP beyond $2.70 as investors execute last-minute trades ahead of today’s high-profile summit. Ripple CEO Confirms Attendance at White House Crypto Summit Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed his participation in the White House Crypto Summit, reinforcing the company’s growing engagement with the Trump administration’s digital asset policies. ” I’ve had some new confirmations for Friday’s White House Crypto Summit. As of this morning, invites were still rolling out. .” FOX report Eleanor Terret Confirmed Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse attendance at White House Crypto Summit, in a March 6 post on X . The summit, led by Trump’s AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks, will feature major industry figures, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor. Discussions will center on regulatory frameworks and a proposed U.S. crypto reserve. Ripple price , already up 19% on Thursday has outperformed Bitcoin’s 4% dip. The affirms investor optimism surrounding the summit’s potential impact on Ripple’s institutional adoption. Analysts suggest a breakout beyond $3 could materialize if policy discussions favor digital asset integration into financial markets. What is the White House Crypto Summit, and How Could It Be Bullish for XRP? The White House Crypto Summit is a pivotal event where key industry leaders and policymakers discuss the future of cryptocurrency regulations in the U.S. Topics include the establishment of a national crypto reserve and clearer guidelines for institutional adoption. For XRP, the summit’s significance lies in its potential to reshape market sentiment. If Ripple gains regulatory clarity or is formally integrated into the proposed reserve, XRP could experience sustained bullish momentum, with traders eyeing a move toward $5. XRP Liquidation Map | March 6 Going by trends observed in Coinglass ‘ latest derivatives market data, majority of XRP short-term traders are anticipated a positive outcome from the summit. As seen in the chart above, XRP long leverage has crossed the $150 million mark at press time on March 6, towering above the active short contracts which currently stands at $115 million. With long leverage outpacing short by more than 20%, the short-term momentum remains largely bullish. However, if negative readings from Non-Farm Payrolls report overshadow headlines from the White House Crypto summit, XRP price risks rapid corrections if the over-leveraged bulls are liquidated. XRP Price Eyes $5 as Bulls Retain Control Ahead of White House Crypto Summit XRP price is holding strong above $2.60, gaining 19% in just two days as technical indicators flash bullish signals. The Parabolic SAR dots remain positioned below price action, confirming the prevailing uptrend, while the MACD histogram shows expanding green bars, signaling strengthening bullish momentum. The MACD line has crossed above the signal line, reinforcing the possibility of a sustained rally. A decisive close above the $2.70 resistance zone could set the stage for a retest of the psychological $3 level, where prior rejection occurred following Trump’s crypto reserve announcement. If bulls maintain control, breaking past $3 could expose XRP to an extended breakout toward the $5 mark in the coming weeks. XRP price analysis | XRPUSD However, failure to hold above the $2.60 level may invite bearish pressure, potentially leading to a retest of the $2.10 support level, where buyers previously stepped in to propel the recent surge. The increasing leverage in long positions, now at $150 million, suggests that market sentiment is skewed toward the upside, but it also introduces liquidation risks if volatility spikes. As the White House Crypto Summit unfolds, XRP’s reaction to regulatory developments could dictate the next major move, with bullish momentum favoring a continued uptrend. The post XRP Price to $5?

Several Key Bitcoin Metrics Are Pointing At The Same Price Range Right Now In its latest weekly report, Glassnode has discussed the Bitcoin investor cost basis from various angles. The first indicator that the analytics firm has shared is the “UTXO Realized Price Distribution” (URPD), that basically tells us about how the BTC supply is distributed among the different price levels based on the last transaction value. Related Reading: Litecoin Whale Deposits 500,000 LTC To Binance: Price Decline To Extend? First, here is how this metric looked before the recent price crash: As is visible in the chart, very few coins had their cost basis between $70,000 and $92,000 before the crash. In on-chain analysis, investor cost basis is considered an important topic, as holders are more likely to make some kind of move when their profit-loss status is threatened. Since this range contained the acquisition level of only a small part of the supply, it was sort of an “air-gap” in terms of potential demand. This may be why BTC easily slipped deep into this region when the crash came. So far, though, the bulls have come through in providing support, as they have since participated in some buying in this vacant region, changing the URPD. Thus, the range is now better set up to provide support than before, although it’s still sort of an empty region when compared to the other Bitcoin cost basis centers. The second indicator that Glassnode has talked about is the Realized Price of the short-term holders. The “Realized Price” is a term that was also in the full form of URPD. What this metric measures is the cost basis of the average investor belonging to a part of the BTC userbase. Below is a chart that shows the trend in the indicator for the short-term holders (STHs), who are the Bitcoin investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. “The Short-Term Holder cost basis has historically acted as an important reference level across bull-market uptrends,” notes the analytics firm. “We have calculated the ±1σ bands of the Short-Term Holder Cost-Basis, which have typically acted as a sort of upper and lower bound for local price action.” Interestingly, this lower bound, that is, the level one standard deviation below the STH Realized Price, is situated at $71,000 right now. This is about the same level as where the previously mentioned air-gap area ends. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Stop: $75,500? Analyst Reveals Historical ‘Magnet’ Level This isn’t the only other place where this level shows up, as the chart for the Active Realized Price shows. The “Active Realized Price” basically takes the Realized Price of the entire BTC network, with an added twist. The metric only includes the ‘economical’ supply, meaning that it excludes for the part of the supply that Glassnode has determined to be unlikely to return back into circulation. At present, the Active Realized Price stands at $70,000, which is once again nearly the same level as the one from the other two indicators. “With significant confluence across several key cost basis metrics, this price region becomes an area of interest, perhaps being the final defence line for the bulls in the event of a complete capitulation,” concludes the report. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $90,000, up almost 5% in the last week.

According to CryptoQuant analyst Darkfrost, this increase in the Binance stablecoin reserve marks a good omen for a positive market rebound. With volatility swaying the market in recent times, it remains to be seen what direction Bitcoin and altcoins will take moving forward. Binance Stablecoin Reserve and Market Shift Per the CryptoQuant data , the ERC-20 stablecoin on Binance has surpassed the $31.3 billion threshold. Darkfrost noted that a bump in the Binance stablecoin reserve often indicates positive momentum. The CryptoQuant analyst attributed the massive Binance stablecoin inflow to two major reasons. These include channeling liquidity into the top crypto trading exchange in preparation for potential market entry. According to Darkfrost, this trend reflects confidence in the market and the exchange. Beyond the influence of third-party investors, Binance could also be consolidating its stablecoin reserve amid a boost in market demand. The stablecoin reserve, per the chart shared by Darkfrost, has been on an upward trend since July 2024. The previous peak recorded onchain came around December 2022. Binance Stablecoin Implication for Bitcoin As the CryptoQuant analyst noted, periods of positive shift in the asset’s reserve often come with a massive push in the price of Bitcoin. “Historically, periods of rising stablecoin reserves on Binance have often coincided with, or even preceded, an increase in BTC prices and a broader upswing in the crypto market,” Darkfrost said in his note. The market has been quite unstable in the past few weeks, with volatility defining the order. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was changing hands for $90,511.91, up marginally by 0.18% in 24 hours. Bitcoin price entered a risky zone earlier as Crypto Czar David Sacks blamed the Biden administration for selling BTC too early. This Bitcoin sentiment and uncertainty around the forthcoming White House Digital Asset Summit fuels market drawdown. Market Dynamics and Trends to Watch While the Binance exchange has enjoyed dominance in trading volume, including the stablecoin market, the trend is set to change. Based on the Markets In Crypto Asset (MiCA) legislation, the exchange has set March 31 to delist non-MiCA compliant tokens . Some ERC-20 tokens, including USDT and EURI, will stop trading on the exchange. This might impact the exchange’s growing stablecoin reserve, which may, in turn, impact the broader market dynamics, as Darkfrost teased.

At this point, all of the assets contemplated by the order would be those seized in civil or criminal forfeitures. The bitcoin will be stored for long-term value in what was termed a ""digital Fort Knox."" ""The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings,"" said David Sacks, Trump's crypto czar, in a statement posted on social media site X. In a video showing the president signing the order , Trump says about establishing the reserve, ""Made the promise, right?"" The order has also nudged government officials to seek ways to add more bitcoin to the reserve, as long as it doesn't harm the federal budget. ""The Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce are authorized to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided that those strategies have no incremental costs on American taxpayers,"" Sacks said. The assets for the non-bitcoin stockpile will be any crypto that the government otherwise seizes. Sacks didn't highlight any particular asset names in that category, despite some being recently highlighted by the president. Matt Hougan, the chief investment officer for Bitwise Asset Management, said in a post that the move to set up a bitcoin reserve reduces the chance the government can ever try to outlaw the asset, and it ""dramatically increases the likelihood that other nations will establish strategic bitcoin reserves.""But Charles Edwards, founder of Bitcoin-focused hedge fund Capriole Investments, called it the ""most underwhelming and disappointing outcome we could have expected for this week,"" arguing that without a buying plan, the strategy is a ""pig in lipstick.""

41257157,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137696,1741307730,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Superstate’s Bold Move: SEC Greenlights Digital Transfer Agent in Crypto Revolution,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-greenlights-digital-transfer-agent/,"In a landmark move signaling the growing maturity of the digital asset space, blockchain-based asset management firm Superstate has achieved a significant milestone. They’ve successfully registered their digital transfer agent, Superstate Services LLC, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This pivotal development, first reported by CoinDesk, underscores the increasing convergence of tokenized assets with established financial regulatory frameworks. Is this the bridge the crypto world has been waiting for to fully integrate with traditional finance? Let’s dive into the details. What is a Digital Transfer Agent and Why Does SEC Registration Matter? To understand the magnitude of Superstate’s achievement, it’s crucial to grasp the role of a digital transfer agent . In traditional finance, transfer agents are the unsung heroes who maintain records of stock owners, process stock transfers, and manage dividend distributions. Now, imagine this crucial function being adapted for the burgeoning world of digital assets and tokenized securities. That’s precisely what a digital transfer agent does – it provides these essential services for blockchain-based assets. SEC registration for a digital transfer agent is not just a formality; it’s a powerful validation. It signifies that Superstate Services LLC has met the stringent regulatory standards set by the Securities and Exchange Commission. This stamp of approval brings a layer of trust and legitimacy to the often-complex and sometimes opaque world of crypto. Think of it as a regulatory green light, paving the way for broader adoption and acceptance of tokenized assets within the existing financial ecosystem. Here’s a breakdown of why SEC registration is a game-changer: Enhanced Trust and Credibility: SEC oversight provides investors and institutions with confidence in the operations and compliance of the digital transfer agent. Regulatory Clarity: Registration offers a clear framework for Superstate to operate within, minimizing legal uncertainties and fostering a compliant environment. Institutional Adoption Catalyst: For institutional investors hesitant to enter the crypto space due to regulatory concerns, SEC-registered entities like Superstate Services LLC can lower the barrier to entry. Market Growth and Maturity: This move contributes to the overall maturation of the digital asset market, demonstrating a commitment to regulatory compliance and long-term sustainability. Tokenized Assets: The Future of Finance? At the heart of this development lies the concept of tokenized assets . But what exactly are they, and why are they gaining traction? In simple terms, tokenization is the process of representing real-world assets – from real estate and art to commodities and securities – as digital tokens on a blockchain. These tokens can then be easily traded, managed, and fractionalized, unlocking a new realm of possibilities. Tokenized assets offer several compelling advantages: Benefit Description Increased Liquidity Tokenization can make traditionally illiquid assets, like real estate, more easily tradable and accessible to a wider range of investors. Fractional Ownership High-value assets can be divided into smaller, more affordable fractions, allowing smaller investors to participate. Enhanced Transparency Blockchain technology provides a transparent and immutable record of ownership and transactions. Streamlined Processes Tokenization can automate and simplify many of the cumbersome processes associated with traditional asset management, reducing costs and increasing efficiency. Global Accessibility Tokenized assets can be traded and accessed globally, breaking down geographical barriers and expanding market reach. Superstate’s registration as a digital transfer agent is a crucial step towards realizing the full potential of tokenized assets . By providing the necessary infrastructure for managing these digital securities in a compliant and regulated manner, Superstate is helping to bridge the gap between the promise of blockchain and the realities of traditional finance. Hester Peirce and the SEC’s Crypto Task Force: A Nod to Innovation? The timing of Superstate’s registration is particularly noteworthy given recent statements from Hester Peirce, a prominent SEC Commissioner often dubbed “Crypto Mom” within the industry. As the newly appointed head of the SEC’s crypto task force, Peirce has consistently advocated for a more innovation-friendly approach to crypto regulation . Her recent emphasis on the critical role of transfer agents in the future of tokenized securities further underscores the significance of Superstate’s move. Peirce’s appointment and her vocal support for sensible crypto regulation could signal a shift in the SEC’s approach. While the SEC has been known for its enforcement-heavy stance in the crypto space, Peirce’s leadership of the crypto task force might pave the way for a more balanced and proactive regulatory environment. This could involve: Clearer Regulatory Guidelines: Providing more explicit guidance for crypto companies to operate within legal boundaries. Encouraging Innovation: Fostering a regulatory environment that supports innovation in the blockchain and digital asset space, rather than stifling it. Industry Collaboration: Engaging in constructive dialogue with industry players to develop practical and effective regulations. Hester Peirce’s focus on transfer agents highlights a pragmatic understanding of the infrastructure needed to support the growth of tokenized assets . By recognizing the importance of these foundational elements, the SEC, under Peirce’s guidance, may be signaling a willingness to work with the industry to build a robust and compliant ecosystem for digital securities. Challenges and the Road Ahead for Digital Asset Regulation While Superstate’s SEC registration is undoubtedly a positive development, the journey towards widespread adoption of tokenized assets and comprehensive crypto regulation is still ongoing. Several challenges remain: Fragmented Regulatory Landscape: Globally, crypto regulation is still fragmented, with varying approaches across different jurisdictions. This creates complexities for companies operating internationally.

As AI technologies like those developed by OpenAI mature, their potential impact on digital currencies and decentralized systems is undeniable. However, recent controversies surrounding AI safety practices at leading AI firms are raising eyebrows and sparking debate within the tech community and beyond. A prominent voice in this debate is Miles Brundage, former policy lead at OpenAI, who is now publicly challenging the company’s narrative on AI history and its approach to GPT-2 deployment. Let’s delve into the heart of this controversy and understand what it means for the future of AI development and its intersection with the crypto world. Why is OpenAI Accused of ‘Rewriting’ its AI History? The core of the issue lies in a recently published document by OpenAI outlining their current philosophy on AI safety and alignment. In this document, OpenAI suggests a shift in perspective regarding the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). They now frame AGI as part of a “continuous path” of AI advancement, advocating for iterative deployment and learning from current AI systems. This contrasts with what they describe as a “discontinuous world” approach, which they claim they adopted for their earlier model, GPT-2 . According to OpenAI, in this discontinuous world, caution was paramount, leading them to treat systems like GPT-2 with “outsized caution.” Here’s a breakdown of OpenAI’s stated positions: Discontinuous World (GPT-2 Era): Characterized by treating early AI systems with significant caution due to perceived risks, even if those risks seemed disproportionate in hindsight. Continuous World (Current Philosophy): Views AGI development as a gradual progression. Emphasizes learning and iterative improvement through deployment of current systems to ensure the safety of future, more advanced AI. However, this narrative is being challenged by Miles Brundage, OpenAI’s former policy research head, who argues that OpenAI is misrepresenting the context of GPT-2 ‘s release and its alignment with their current “iterative deployment” philosophy. Miles Brundage’s Powerful Criticism: What’s the Real Story of GPT-2 and AI Safety? Miles Brundage , who was deeply involved in OpenAI’s GPT-2 release strategy, took to social media platform X to voice his concerns. He contends that the cautious and incremental release of GPT-2 was entirely consistent with, and even foreshadowed, OpenAI’s present-day iterative deployment approach. Brundage highlights that: GPT-2’s Incremental Release: The model was not fully released immediately. Instead, OpenAI opted for a phased rollout, sharing lessons and insights at each stage. Expert Support for Caution: Many security experts at the time applauded OpenAI’s cautious approach to GPT-2 , recognizing the potential risks associated with such powerful language models. Brundage firmly believes that the caution exercised during the GPT-2 release was justified given the information available at the time. He questions OpenAI’s current characterization of that period as belonging to a “discontinuous world” approach, arguing that it was, in fact, an early example of the iterative deployment strategy they now champion. The GPT-2 Context: Why Was There So Much AI Safety Concern? To understand Brundage’s perspective, it’s crucial to remember the environment surrounding GPT-2 in 2019. GPT-2 was a significant leap forward in AI text generation. It could perform tasks previously thought to be uniquely human, such as: Answering questions on a wide range of topics. Summarizing lengthy articles. Generating human-quality text that was, at times, indistinguishable from human writing. Despite seeming less sophisticated by today’s standards, GPT-2 was groundbreaking at the time. OpenAI , acknowledging the potential for misuse, initially chose not to release the full source code, citing risks of malicious applications like generating fake news or spam. This decision, while debated, underscores the genuine AI safety concerns prevalent at the time. What are Brundage’s Fears About OpenAI’s Current Stance on AI Safety? Miles Brundage worries that OpenAI’s recent document is designed to shift the burden of proof regarding AI safety concerns. He fears that OpenAI is attempting to create an environment where: Concerns are Dismissed as Alarmist: Legitimate worries about AI safety might be downplayed or labeled as exaggerated. High Evidence Threshold: Action on AI safety would only be taken when there is “overwhelming evidence of imminent dangers.” Brundage argues that this mentality is “very dangerous,” especially as AI systems become increasingly advanced and potentially impactful. He questions OpenAI’s motives for “poo-pooing caution” and wonders if it signals a shift towards prioritizing rapid product releases over comprehensive AI safety measures. Are Competitive Pressures Affecting OpenAI’s AI Safety Priorities? There’s a growing narrative that competitive pressures in the AI industry might be influencing OpenAI ‘s approach to AI safety . OpenAI has faced accusations in the past of prioritizing “shiny products” and rushing releases to outpace competitors. This pressure has only intensified with the rise of competitors like Chinese AI lab DeepSeek, whose R1 model has reportedly matched OpenAI’s o1 model in certain benchmarks. Adding to the pressure, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has admitted that DeepSeek has narrowed OpenAI’s technological lead. Furthermore, reports suggest OpenAI is facing significant financial losses, projected to potentially triple to $14 billion annually by 2026. In this context, a faster product release cycle could offer short-term financial benefits but might compromise long-term AI safety considerations. The Bigger AI Safety Debate: Balancing Innovation and Responsibility The disagreement between Miles Brundage and OpenAI highlights a fundamental tension in the AI field: balancing rapid innovation with responsible development and deployment. Experts like Brundage are raising critical questions about whether the current race to dominate the AI market is overshadowing crucial AI safety protocols. The concerns are not just about technical safeguards but also about the broader ethical and societal implications of increasingly powerful AI systems. As the crypto and blockchain space increasingly integrates AI, these AI safety debates become even more relevant. The security and reliability of decentralized systems could be profoundly affected by the underlying AI technologies they utilize. Therefore, understanding and engaging with the discussions around AI history , AI safety , and responsible development is crucial for anyone involved in the future of digital currencies and beyond. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for AI Safety and OpenAI’s Path Forward The critique from Miles Brundage serves as a stark reminder that the path to advanced AI is not just about technological breakthroughs but also about navigating complex ethical and AI safety landscapes. As OpenAI and other AI leaders continue to shape the future of this transformative technology, the debate over AI history , deployment strategies, and the prioritization of AI safety will remain central. The crypto community, with its inherent focus on security and decentralization, has a vested interest in ensuring these discussions are robust and lead to responsible AI innovation.

This reserve is intended to serve as a store of value, with the government opting to hold the digital asset rather than selling it off. Donald Trump Signs Order to Create U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve In a lengthy post on X , Crypto Czar David Sacks revealed that President Donald Trump has officially signed an Executive Order to establish the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This initiative is designed to safeguard Bitcoin confiscated through legal forfeiture proceedings and store it as a national asset. The federal government currently possesses an estimated 200,000 Bitcoin, though a comprehensive audit has never been conducted. The Executive Order mandates a full accounting of all federal digital asset holdings to provide transparency regarding the government’s cryptocurrency assets. A recent report highlighted that it would be impossible for taxpayer money to be used for the Strategic Crypto Reserve without congressional approval. To work around this, officials are considering alternatives such as repurposing seized Bitcoin or establishing a sovereign wealth fund.

Russia, facing a barrage of international sanctions, is turning to digital assets as a potential workaround. But can sanctions truly cripple a nation’s access to the decentralized world of crypto? A prominent Russian lawmaker suggests otherwise, sparking a crucial debate about the limitations of financial restrictions in the age of blockchain. Let’s delve into the details of Russia’s evolving crypto strategy and what it means for the global financial landscape. Can Sanctions Truly Block Russia from Crypto? Anton Gorelkin, a Russian lawmaker, recently stated that sanctions are not a foolproof method to completely isolate Russia from the cryptocurrency sphere. This assertion comes amidst escalating efforts from international bodies to tighten the screws on Russia’s financial access. Gorelkin’s perspective highlights a critical challenge in the digital age: the decentralized and borderless nature of cryptocurrencies. While traditional financial systems are susceptible to sanctions, the crypto ecosystem presents a different playing field. Here’s a breakdown of why completely cutting off Russia from crypto is proving to be a complex task: Decentralization: Cryptocurrencies, by design, operate without central intermediaries like banks. This decentralized nature makes it difficult for any single entity to control or block transactions. Global Reach: Crypto transactions can occur across borders with relative ease. While exchanges can be regulated, peer-to-peer transactions and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) offer alternative routes. Technological Adaptability: The crypto space is constantly evolving. New tools and methods are continuously emerging, making it challenging for regulators to keep pace and enforce restrictions comprehensively. However, it’s crucial to acknowledge that sanctions do have an impact. The effectiveness of sanctions in the crypto context is not about complete blockage but rather about increasing friction and costs, and limiting access to certain regulated platforms and stablecoins like USDT. The Role of Russian Crypto Regulation in Navigating Sanctions Russia’s approach to crypto regulation has been evolving, particularly in light of international sanctions. Initially hesitant, the Russian government has gradually warmed up to the idea of digital assets, especially for international trade and mining. This shift is partly driven by the need to find alternative financial channels in the face of restrictions. Key regulatory developments in Russia’s crypto landscape include: Legalization of Crypto Mining: Russia has officially legalized cryptocurrency mining, recognizing it as an economic activity. This move aims to leverage Russia’s energy resources and attract investments in the crypto sector. Crypto for International Trade: Despite previous reservations, Russia has authorized the use of cryptocurrencies for international trade settlements. This is a significant step towards using crypto to bypass traditional financial systems and sanctions. Ongoing Regulatory Framework Development: Russia is still in the process of developing a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. This includes clarifying the legal status of crypto assets, taxation, and consumer protection measures. While these regulatory steps indicate a pro-crypto stance, the actual implementation and effectiveness in circumventing sanctions remain to be seen. The global crypto ecosystem is also subject to international regulations and compliance standards, which could pose challenges for Russia’s ambitions. Why is Cryptocurrency Russia Still Pursuing Digital Assets? Despite international pressure and sanctions, cryptocurrency Russia is increasingly embracing digital assets. This strategic pivot is driven by a combination of factors, highlighting the potential benefits Russia sees in the crypto space: Benefit Description Sanctions Evasion Cryptocurrencies offer a potential alternative to traditional financial channels that are subject to sanctions. They can facilitate cross-border transactions with less reliance on sanctioned banks and payment systems. International Trade Using crypto for international trade can help Russia bypass restrictions on SWIFT and other international payment networks, enabling continued commerce with willing partners. Financial Innovation Embracing crypto can foster innovation in Russia’s financial sector, attracting tech talent and potentially creating new economic opportunities. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Exploring DeFi applications could provide Russia with access to alternative financial services and investment opportunities outside the traditional regulated system. However, pursuing a crypto strategy is not without its challenges. Russia needs to navigate regulatory hurdles, ensure cybersecurity, and manage the volatility inherent in the crypto market. Furthermore, the international community is closely monitoring Russia’s crypto activities, and further measures to tighten crypto-related sanctions cannot be ruled out. USDT Sanctions Impact : A Less Viable Option for Russia? According to Anton Gorelkin, USDT (Tether), a popular stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, is becoming a less viable option for Russia in the context of sanctions. This is primarily due to: Centralized Nature of USDT: Unlike truly decentralized cryptocurrencies, USDT is issued and controlled by Tether Limited, a centralized entity. This makes it susceptible to regulatory pressure and potential blacklisting of specific addresses or users. Regulatory Scrutiny: Stablecoins, including USDT, are facing increasing regulatory scrutiny globally. Concerns about transparency, reserves, and potential illicit use are prompting authorities to tighten regulations. Dependence on the US Dollar: As USDT is pegged to the US dollar, its value and accessibility are inherently linked to the US financial system. This dependence makes it less attractive for countries seeking to reduce reliance on the dollar in the face of US sanctions. The recent EU sanctions targeting Garantex, a crypto exchange reportedly popular in Russia, further underscore the increasing pressure on crypto platforms facilitating transactions involving sanctioned entities. While USDT remains widely used, its long-term viability for Russia as a sanctions workaround is increasingly questionable. Alternative stablecoins or decentralized cryptocurrencies might become more appealing in this context. Crypto International Trade Russia : A Bold but Challenging Path Russia’s move to legalize crypto international trade Russia represents a bold attempt to adapt to the new geopolitical reality. Using cryptocurrencies for cross-border payments could offer several advantages: Reduced Reliance on Traditional Banking: Crypto transactions can bypass traditional banks, which are often intermediaries in international trade and susceptible to sanctions. Faster and Cheaper Transactions: Crypto transactions can be faster and potentially cheaper than traditional international wire transfers, especially for smaller businesses. Access to Unbanked Markets: Cryptocurrencies can facilitate trade with countries that have limited access to traditional banking infrastructure. However, implementing crypto for international trade at scale presents significant hurdles: Volatility: The price volatility of many cryptocurrencies poses a challenge for trade settlements. Stablecoins can mitigate this risk, but their regulatory status and centralization concerns remain. Regulatory Compliance: Businesses engaging in crypto international trade still need to navigate anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations in different jurisdictions. Adoption and Infrastructure: Widespread adoption of crypto for international trade requires building the necessary infrastructure, educating businesses, and overcoming inertia in traditional trade practices. Despite these challenges, Russia’s foray into crypto for international trade signals a significant shift and could potentially inspire other nations facing similar geopolitical pressures to explore digital asset solutions. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto Sanctions Maze The situation surrounding crypto sanctions Russia is complex and rapidly evolving. While sanctions can create obstacles and increase friction, they are unlikely to completely block Russia’s access to the crypto world. Russia’s legalization of mining and crypto for international trade demonstrates a proactive approach to leveraging digital assets in a challenging economic environment. However, the effectiveness of this strategy will depend on various factors, including the global regulatory landscape, technological advancements in the crypto space, and the evolving nature of international sanctions. The case of Russia highlights the inherent tension between the decentralized nature of crypto and the centralized control mechanisms of traditional finance and geopolitics. As nations grapple with these complexities, the future of crypto in international relations and economic sanctions will undoubtedly be a space to watch closely.

Key Insights: Bitcoin fell 4.25% to $86,295, breaking below the 50-day EMA at $88,574. A bearish engulfing candle signals potential further downside toward $84,351. A recovery above $88,574 could push BTC back toward resistance at $89,998.

White House Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, wrote in a post on X that the reserve will be funded exclusively with Bitcoin seized in criminal and civil forfeiture cases, ensuring that taxpayers bear no financial burden. Just a few minutes ago, President Trump signed an Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it… — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) March 7, 2025 Trump’s crypto reserve plan sparks debate among Bitcoin purists Estimates suggest the U.S. government holds around 200,000 Bitcoin, though no full audit has been conducted. Trump’s order calls for a comprehensive review of federal digital asset holdings and bans the sale of Bitcoin from the reserve, establishing it as a long-term store of value. Moreover, the order establishes a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, managed by the Treasury Department, to hold other confiscated cryptocurrencies. Several crypto investors who have supported Trump raised concerns over the weekend after the president said in a post on Truth Social that in addition to BTC, ETH, XRP, Solana’s SOL token, and Cardano’s ADA coin would be part of a strategic crypto reserve. “I have nothing against XRP, SOL, or ADA, but I do not think they are suitable for a Strategic Reserve,” bitcoin billionaire Tyler Winklevoss wrote. “Only one digital asset in the world right now meets the bar, and that digital asset is Bitcoin.” Bitcoin-only reserve plan strengthens U.S. position as a crypto powerhouse Before the announcement, Castle Island Ventures’ Nic Carter said that a U.S. commitment to a Bitcoin-only reserve would solidify Bitcoin as a significant global asset comparable to gold. Carter stressed that the U.S., as the biggest nation in the world, is a key driver of Bitcoin’s legitimacy. Restricting the reserve to Bitcoin reinforces its position as a major asset, while allowing other digital currencies into the reserve would have forced it to look like a speculative fund. Ryan Gilbert, a fintech investor, said that the move would send a strong message to institutions that Bitcoin was here to stay and would further differentiate it from other cryptocurrencies. Gilbert said that for 15 years now, many people have said that Bitcoin is the only digital asset and that all other tokens should be ignored. He believes this will help separate Bitcoin from other sophisticated coins in their tussles, ensuring Bitcoin maintains its position in the debate. Even so, Gilbert warned that the U.S. needs to be judicious in how it receives such reserve. He also stressed that the U.S. should not actively trade Bitcoin because the reserve is intended to be a long-term store of value and not to catalyze market speculation. Sacks lauded the decision, describing it as a “milestone” in establishing the U.S. as the “crypto capital of the world.” He has previously pointed out that the U.S. missed out on more than $17 billion in lost value by selling off seized Bitcoin too early. According to Sacks, further policy development will center on budget-neutral acquisition strategies for Bitcoin, which Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick will oversee. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve eases $18B sell pressure, says Coinbase exec According to Coinbase executive Conor Grogan, U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve may relieve massive sell-side pressure. “By my estimation, the [U.S. government] owns 198.109k BTC. This executive order removes ~$18B of sell-side pressure,” said Grogan, Coinbase’s Director of Product Strategy and Business Operations, in a post to X on Thursday. Arkham Intelligence data shows that the U.S. government currently holds about 198,109 BTC, 122 million USDT and 56,035 ETH , among other tokens. Following the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve announcement, Bitcoin extended its losses, tumbling 5.7% in under an hour. The drop followed Bitcoin’s rise earlier in the week, which was above $92,000, based on speculation around the initiative. But the rally has since lost steam as traders book profits and reassess the market impact of the government’s new digital asset policy. Bitcoin has since recovered some to $87,200, according to CoinGecko data. Ethereum was down 6.1% at $2,100, while Solana and Dogecoin fell 6.8% and 5.8%, respectively. Binance’s BNB declined 3.6% to $576 and Cardano shed 13.8% to $0.81, among the biggest losers among major tokens.

Congratulations to everyone in the Pi community for supporting Pi and making this possible.” Pi Network rises in rankings as community pushes for Binance listing Like any other asset growing with the rise of X followers, Pi Network trust is one of the many indicators. The app has similarly reached impressive milestones on the Google Play Store, including more than 113.2 million downloads. For the last month, the Network has seen an average of 270,000 new downloads every day. Apart from social media and app downloads, Pi Network also treats success beyond its ecosystem in the wider crypto space. Of late, it recently placed among CoinGecko’s top five “Made in USA Coins,” even outperforming popular altcoins like Chainlink (LINK), Hedera (HBAR), and Stellar (XLM). Its immediate success was recently displayed as it entered CoinMarketCap’s top rankings, proving more than its footing in the industry. However, despite this success, one of the greatest hurdles yet to overcome is the lack of a Pi Coin (PI) listing on Binance, one of the largest exchanges in the world. A Binance community vote showed that 86% of participants supported an official PI listing. So far, Binance has not acted, making Pi fans increasingly impatient. One pioneer stepped up on X to galvanize support, pledging , “We call on the crypto community to unite! Demand that Binance officially announce the listing of Pi Network.” With growing impatience, Pi Network co-founder Chengdiao Fan urged the community to stay focused, requesting that they focus on what matters and what makes a difference in the crypto space. Fan told Pi supporters to keep building and innovating and to believe that market acceptance will eventually come. Pi Network gains momentum as exchange listings and market interest drive growth For some time, Pi Network has been encumbered by AML (anti-money laundering) concerns and regulatory barriers. The mainstream embrace of trading was limited to rope trading in P2P and OTC markets. However, recent changes to U.S. regulatory policy under the Trump administration increased interest in the Network, with potential listings on major exchanges, including Bitget. This week, Pi Coin made the most important announcement on Tuesday that it had secured a listing through CoinMarketCap. As a result, Pi Coin rose 3% to above $1.74, with a $12.1 billion market cap at press time. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

A judge in the District Court of Northern California delivered a final ruling in the foundation’s legal conflict with Mark Shin, who exploited the bug. “Code is not de-facto law,” Icon concluded. The case was brought by Shin in 2021 after Icon froze his accounts and seized his assets. Before that, Shin had taken advantage of a bug 557 times to generate tokens improperly and increase the token supply by 2.5%. The token subsequently lost 40% of its value. The bug doubled staking withdrawals A software update implemented in August 2020 allowed holders of certain wallets (less than 0.05% of them) to generate an equal number of ICX to the amount the holder removes from staking. Shin used that bug 557 times. The attack, its detection and its solution took place in 11 hours. Shin was not the only user to exploit the bug, but he generated the majority of the erroneous tokens. The Icon Foundation offered Shin a $200,000 bug bounty for the return of the bug-generated tokens, but he rejected the offer. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations seized some of the tokens Shin had transferred from his Icon wallets to cryptocurrency exchanges. A grand jury in Colorado, where Shin is a resident, indicted him for his actions, but his trial resulted in a hung jury, and the Colorado attorney general declined to retry him. Shin could have faced eight to 24 years each on the two felony theft charges and four to 12 years for felony money laundering. Shin wanted the rest of his bug-generated tokens Shin filed suit against Icon in October 2020 seeking the return of the ICX tokens frozen in his Icon wallets. Icon claimed Shin’s actions were unjust enrichment. The sides requested summary judgment in the case in June 2024, and Judge William Orrick dismissed Shin’s claims with prejudice, meaning Shin could not refile the case. In his final ruling on March 3, Orrick ruled that Shin was responsible for Icon’s legal fees of at least $3.5 million and ordered all remaining seized assets converted back to ICX and destroyed. Shin had transferred around 2.1 million of the bug-generated tokens, using the Tornado Cash crypto mixer for some or all of them. Burning the bug-generated tokens will have a deflationary effect on ICX, thus protecting its value. According to an X post reposted by the Icon community, the tokens up for burning are worth around $8 million. “This ruling sets an important precedent for decentralized networks, that code is not de-facto law, and entities have the ability to protect their operations against exploits,” Icon stated in its blog. The blog also quotes at Manatt, Phelps & Phillips Partner Christopher Wanger, who said, “The court’s order confirms that the world of digital assets is not the wild, wild west, code is not law and basic equitable principles apply to cryptocurrency.” Icon was founded in 2017. It is a layer-1 blockchain that hosts apps that can be easily used cross-chain. According to Coingecko , ICX has a total supply of 1.06 million and a market cap of $117.20 million. It’s 24-hour trading volume at the time of writing was $1.65 million and ICX was trading for $0.114 and falling.

BTC fell from $90,251 to $85,091 in less than an hour after Trump signed the order, which establishes a national Bitcoin and crypto stockpile by holding digital assets seized from criminal activities rather than auctioning them off as had been previous practice. BTC has since recovered to $87,202 at time of publishing. The move had been widely anticipated and confirmed the executive action will not actively push the US to purchase crypto assets. White House artificial intelligence and crypto czar David Sacks released a statement on the signing. “Just a few minutes ago, President Trump signed an Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it will not cost taxpayers a dime. It is estimated that the U.S. government owns about 200,000 bitcoin; however, there has never been a complete audit. The E.O. directs a full accounting of the federal government’s digital asset holdings. The U.S. will not sell any bitcoin deposited into the Reserve. It will be kept as a store of value. The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called “digital gold.” Premature sales of bitcoin have already cost U.S. taxpayers over $17 billion in lost value. Now the federal government will have a strategy to maximize the value of its holdings. The Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce are authorized to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided that those strategies have no incremental costs on American taxpayers. IN ADDITION, the Executive Order establishes a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, consisting of digital assets other than bitcoin forfeited in criminal or civil proceedings. The government will not acquire additional assets for the Stockpile beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings. The purpose of the Stockpile is responsible stewardship of the government’s digital assets under the Treasury Department. PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT President Trump promised to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile. Those promises have been kept. This Executive Order underscores President Trump’s commitment to making the U.S. the “crypto capital of the world.” I want to thank the President for his leadership and vision in supporting this cutting-edge technology and for his rapid execution in supporting the digital asset industry. His administration is truly moving at ‘tech speed.’ I also want to thank the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets — especially Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick — for their help and support in getting this done. Finally Bo Hines played a critical role as Executive Director of our Working Group.” Bitcoin’s price move has partially retraced a major jump triggered in large part by Trump’s pro-crypto stance. After Trump first announced the strategic Bitcoin reserve during his campaign and won the election on November 5th, BTC surged from around $65,000 to a peak of $108,268 on December 17th.

41258757,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137712,1741310746,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Analysis: Macroeconomic Uncertainty Triggers Risk Aversion in Cryptocurrency Market,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/macroeconomic-uncertainty-risk-aversion-crypto/,"Are you feeling a sense of unease in the cryptocurrency market lately? You’re not alone. The global economic landscape is becoming increasingly uncertain, and this is having a direct impact on digital assets. Let’s dive into a recent analysis that sheds light on why we’re seeing increased risk aversion and what it could mean for the future of crypto. Decoding Macroeconomic Uncertainty: What’s Driving the Fear? According to cryptocurrency analyst Noelle Acheson, the current climate of macroeconomic uncertainty is the primary driver behind the growing risk aversion in the markets. But what exactly does “macroeconomic uncertainty” entail? It’s essentially a broad term that encompasses various factors creating instability and unpredictability in the global economy. These factors include: Inflationary Pressures: Persistent high inflation across major economies is forcing central banks to take aggressive measures, like raising interest rates, to combat it. This creates uncertainty about future economic growth. Interest Rate Hikes: As central banks aggressively hike interest rates to tame inflation, borrowing costs increase for businesses and consumers. This can slow down economic activity and increase the likelihood of a recession. Geopolitical Instability: Ongoing geopolitical tensions and conflicts add another layer of uncertainty, disrupting supply chains and impacting global markets. Recessionary Signals: Economic indicators in major economies, like the U.S., are flashing warning signs, suggesting a potential recession . This combination of factors creates a perfect storm of uncertainty, leading investors to become more cautious and risk-averse. They tend to move away from assets perceived as risky, like cryptocurrencies, towards safer havens. Risk Aversion Takes Center Stage: How Does it Impact Crypto? When risk aversion spikes, investors typically reduce their exposure to volatile assets. Cryptocurrencies, known for their price swings, are often among the first to feel the heat. Acheson highlights this in her analysis, suggesting that the cryptocurrency market is likely to face downward pressure in the short term due to this increased risk-off sentiment. Think of it like this: imagine you’re navigating a stormy sea. In calm waters, you might be adventurous and explore uncharted territories (risky assets). But as the storm intensifies (economic uncertainty), your priority shifts to seeking safe harbor and securing your belongings (safe assets). This “flight to safety” is precisely what we’re observing in the markets right now. The Inverted Yield Curve: A Recessionary Alarm Bell? Acheson points to a critical economic indicator: the inverted yield curve . The yield curve represents the difference in yields between bonds of different maturities. Normally, longer-term bonds have higher yields than shorter-term bonds. However, when short-term bond yields rise above long-term bond yields, the yield curve inverts. Historically, an inverted yield curve has been a reliable predictor of economic recessions. Acheson notes that the spread between the U.S. 10-year and 3-month Treasury bonds has turned negative again, signaling a renewed inversion. This inversion reinforces concerns about a potential recession in the U.S. economy, further fueling risk aversion. Let’s break down why an inverted yield curve is considered a recessionary indicator: Indicator Normal Yield Curve Inverted Yield Curve Long-term bond yields Higher Lower Short-term bond yields Lower Higher Economic Outlook Positive/Stable Negative/Recessionary Investor Sentiment Optimistic Pessimistic The inversion suggests that investors anticipate lower interest rates in the future, typically a response to expected economic slowdown or recession. This anticipation itself can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, as businesses and consumers become more cautious in their spending and investment decisions. Is Bitcoin a Safe Haven Amidst Economic Storms? Interestingly, amidst all the gloom, Acheson highlights a contrasting narrative: the “safe haven” appeal of Bitcoin is gaining traction. While macroeconomic uncertainty and risk aversion typically push investors away from crypto, Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed by some as a store of value, a hedge against inflation, and a safe haven asset, similar to gold. This narrative is fueled, in part, by positive news and pronouncements, potentially from institutions or governments, that could boost confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. However, it’s crucial to remember that the “safe haven” narrative for Bitcoin is still evolving and is not universally accepted. Bitcoin’s price volatility remains significant, and it’s still subject to market fluctuations driven by broader economic trends and investor sentiment. Navigating the Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts So, what does all this mean for you as a crypto investor or enthusiast? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on macroeconomic indicators, central bank policies, and geopolitical developments. These factors will significantly influence the cryptocurrency market in the coming months. Manage Risk: In times of heightened risk aversion , it’s prudent to manage your portfolio risk. Consider diversifying your holdings and adjusting your asset allocation to align with your risk tolerance. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that market cycles are a natural part of investing. While short-term pressures may exist, maintain a long-term perspective on the potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Due Diligence: Continue to do your research on specific crypto projects and understand their fundamentals. Focus on projects with strong use cases, solid teams, and robust technology. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): In volatile markets, DCA can be a strategy to mitigate risk. Instead of investing a lump sum, consider investing smaller amounts at regular intervals. Conclusion: Weathering the Storm with Knowledge and Prudence The current macroeconomic uncertainty is undoubtedly creating headwinds for the cryptocurrency market . Increased risk aversion , fueled by factors like inflation, interest rate hikes, and recession fears indicated by the inverted yield curve , is likely to put pressure on crypto prices in the short term. However, the evolving narrative of Bitcoin as a potential safe haven offers a glimmer of hope and highlights the complex and dynamic nature of the crypto landscape. Navigating these uncertain times requires a balanced approach – staying informed, managing risk prudently, and maintaining a long-term perspective. By understanding the macroeconomic forces at play and their potential impact on the crypto market, you can make more informed decisions and weather the storm with greater confidence.

On the other hand, Snek (SNEK) is making waves, jumping 20.17% over the same period, showing impressive resilience on the Cardano blockchain. But the biggest buzz in the market is around BTFD Coin, where investors are pouring in ahead of a major presale milestone. With over $6.26 million raised, a 100% bonus code still active, and a referral program rewarding the top players, BTFD is shaping up to be the next crypto to explode . BTFD Coin’s Referral Program Sparks FOMO Meme coins aren’t just about hype anymore— BTFD Coin is leading a movement. The project has not only built a loyal Bulls Squad but also introduced a referral program that’s turning heads. The concept is simple: share your referral code, and if someone buys BTFD with it, they get an extra 10% in tokens—and if you’re in the top 20 referrers, you get 10% of the total raise in BTFD at the end of the month. The presale is moving fast, with Stage 14 priced at just $0.00016 per token. That means investors can still grab BTFD at a steep discount before it lists at $0.0006. And with a projected moon price of $0.006, the potential returns are staggering. For example, an $8,000 investment in Stage 14 would secure 50 million BTFD tokens. At the listing price of $0.0006, that would be worth $30,000. But if BTFD reaches its projected $0.006 moon price, that same investment would skyrocket to $300,000, making it clear why investors are treating BTFD Coin as the next crypto to explode. With over 71 billion BTFD tokens sold and 11,200 investors already on board, the Bulls Squad is growing fast. The 100% bonus code (LAUNCH100) won’t last forever, making this the last chance to double your tokens before the presale moves into its final stages. ai16z Faces Headwinds Amid Market Volatility While AI-driven cryptos were all the rage just a few months ago, some are now struggling to maintain momentum. ai16z, the venture capital AI project, has been slipping, down 20% in a week, with trading volume dropping by 11.65%. Investors seem to be reconsidering their positions, causing a sell-off that’s put pressure on the price. The idea behind ai16z is groundbreaking—a crypto fund managed by AI with the goal of shaping Web3 investments. However, the market response has been mixed, and recent trading activity suggests that some investors are cashing out as uncertainty looms. That said, AI tokens have proven to be resilient in the past, and ai16z could see a turnaround if market sentiment shifts. Snek Continues to Gain Momentum on Cardano While some projects are experiencing market turbulence, Snek (SNEK) is enjoying an impressive rally. Over the last seven days, Snek’s price has jumped 20.17%, solidifying its position as Cardano’s leading memecoin. Despite a 2.06% decline in the last 24 hours, Snek’s long-term outlook remains strong, with consistent trading volume and a rapidly growing community. Unlike Ethereum-based meme coins, Snek benefits from the efficiency of the Cardano blockchain, which offers lower transaction fees and a more scalable infrastructure. This has helped Snek attract both meme coin traders and Cardano enthusiasts, creating a strong base of support. With Cardano adoption rising, many see Snek as a long-term contender in the meme coin space. As the most traded token on Cardano, its momentum isn’t slowing down anytime soon. Conclusion: The Next Crypto To Explode Is Here—Are You In? Based on our research and market trends, meme coins and AI-driven cryptos continue to shape the market. ai16z is facing short-term volatility, while Snek’s recent surge has caught the attention of investors looking for strong memecoin plays. But the biggest buzz right now is around BTFD Coin, where investors are rushing to get in before the presale closes. With over $6.26 million raised, a 100% bonus still available, and a referral program rewarding early adopters, BTFD Coin is shaping up to be the next crypto to explode. The chance to double your tokens with LAUNCH100 won’t last forever, making now the perfect time to jump in before prices move up . FAQs Why is BTFD Coin the next crypto to explode? BTFD Coin’s 3650% ROI potential, referral program, and 100% bonus offer make it one of the hottest meme coin presales right now. How high can BTFD Coin go? With a Stage 14 price of $0.00016, a listing price of $0.0006, and a moon price projection of $0.006, early investors could see massive gains. Is Snek still a good investment? Snek’s 20.17% weekly gains show strong momentum, making it a solid pick in the Cardano ecosystem.

41259068,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137729,1741311342,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Mistral AI: The European Challenger to OpenAI’s AI Dominance?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/mistral-ai-openai-competitor-europe/,"In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, a new contender has emerged, capturing global attention and sparking conversations about the future of AI competition. Meet Mistral AI, a French startup that is not just turning heads but is being openly championed as Europe’s best hope to challenge the dominance of OpenAI. With a valuation soaring to billions and a suite of innovative AI models , Mistral AI is making waves. But is it truly poised to become a significant OpenAI competitor , and what makes it so special? Let’s dive into everything you need to know about this fascinating company. What Exactly is Mistral AI? Born in 2023, Mistral AI quickly positioned itself with a bold ambition: to “put frontier AI in the hands of everyone.” This isn’t just a catchy slogan; it reflects the company’s core philosophy of promoting openness and accessibility in the AI space. While not explicitly targeting OpenAI, this mission statement subtly highlights a different approach compared to some of its competitors. Mistral AI aims to democratize advanced AI technology. The company’s commitment to this vision is evident in its product offerings, most notably Le Chat , Mistral AI’s answer to ChatGPT. This AI assistant is now readily available on both iOS and Android platforms, marking a significant step in making advanced AI tools more accessible to everyday users. The initial reception has been enthusiastic, with Le Chat achieving one million downloads within two weeks of its mobile launch and even topping the free download charts in France’s iOS App Store. This surge in popularity was further boosted by endorsements from high-profile figures, including French President Emmanuel Macron, who publicly encouraged citizens to choose Le Chat over alternatives like ChatGPT. Beyond Le Chat, Mistral AI has developed a comprehensive suite of AI models , each designed for specific applications and needs. These include: Mistral Large 2 : Their flagship large language model, designed to succeed the original Mistral Large, aiming for top-tier performance in complex AI tasks. Pixtral Large : A multimodal model introduced in 2024, expanding the Pixtral family and capable of processing various types of data beyond just text. Codestral : A generative AI model specifically tailored for code generation, assisting developers in writing and understanding code more efficiently. “Les Ministraux” : A family of models optimized for edge computing, designed to run efficiently on devices with limited resources, like smartphones. Mistral Saba : A model with a focus on Arabic language processing, showcasing Mistral AI’s commitment to linguistic diversity and global accessibility. Mistral OCR : Introduced in March 2025, this Optical Character Recognition API converts PDFs into text, streamlining data ingestion for AI models. Who are the Masterminds Behind Mistral AI? The foundation of Mistral AI rests on the shoulders of three founders, each bringing a wealth of experience from leading AI research labs at major U.S. tech giants with significant operations in Paris. This concentration of talent in France is a key factor in why Mistral AI is considered a jewel in the crown of European AI innovation. Arthur Mensch (CEO) : Formerly with Google’s DeepMind, Mensch brings leadership and a deep understanding of advanced AI research and development. Timothée Lacroix (CTO) : A former Meta staffer, Lacroix’s technical expertise is crucial in driving Mistral AI’s technological advancements and infrastructure. Guillaume Lample (Chief Scientist Officer) : Also from Meta, Lample’s role as Chief Scientist Officer underscores the company’s commitment to cutting-edge research and scientific rigor in AI development. Adding to this impressive lineup, Mistral AI’s co-founding advisors include Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve and Charles Gorintin from Alan, and Cédric O, a former digital minister. This blend of tech expertise and business acumen, alongside political connections, positions Mistral AI uniquely within the European tech landscape. Open Source or Proprietary: Decoding Mistral AI’s Model Strategy A key differentiator for Mistral AI lies in its approach to open source. Unlike some competitors who keep their most advanced models strictly proprietary, Mistral AI adopts a nuanced strategy, differentiating between its premier models and its free offerings. This strategy is crucial in understanding how Mistral AI positions itself in the competitive AI models market. While Mistral AI’s top-tier models are not open source for commercial use, the company actively supports the open-source community by providing access to the weights of certain research models under the Apache 2.0 license. A prime example is Mistral NeMo, a research model developed in collaboration with Nvidia, which was open-sourced in July 2024. This commitment to open source fosters innovation and collaboration within the AI community, aligning with their mission to democratize AI. How Does Mistral AI Generate Revenue? While many of Mistral AI’s offerings are free or have free tiers, the company has a clear monetization strategy to support its ambitious growth and research. Revenue generation is essential for Mistral AI to compete effectively as an OpenAI competitor and sustain its operations. Mistral AI’s revenue streams include: Le Chat Pro Subscription : Introduced in February 2025, Le Chat’s Pro plan is priced at $14.99 per month, offering users enhanced features and capabilities for a premium experience. API Access to Premier Models : On the B2B front, Mistral AI monetizes its advanced models through APIs with usage-based pricing, catering to businesses needing powerful AI solutions. Enterprise Licensing : Companies can license Mistral AI’s premier models for integration into their own systems and applications, providing a significant revenue stream. Strategic Partnerships : Collaborations with major industry players are likely a substantial source of revenue, as highlighted during the Paris AI Summit. Despite these diverse revenue streams, reports indicate that Mistral AI’s revenue is still in the eight-digit range. Scaling revenue to match its multi-billion dollar valuation remains a key challenge for the company. Strategic Alliances: Mistral AI’s Key Partnerships Strategic partnerships are crucial for any tech startup aiming for rapid growth and market penetration. Mistral AI has been proactive in forging alliances to expand its reach and capabilities in the competitive European AI landscape. Key partnerships include: Microsoft : In 2024, Mistral AI struck a deal with Microsoft, encompassing a strategic partnership to distribute its AI models via Microsoft Azure and a €15 million investment. While the deal was cleared by the UK’s CMA without investigation, it did raise some eyebrows in the EU regarding potential concentration of power. Agence France-Presse (AFP) : A January 2025 agreement allows Le Chat to query AFP’s extensive text archive dating back to 1983, enhancing its information retrieval capabilities. French Government & Industry : Strategic partnerships with the French army, job agency, German defense tech startup Helsing, IBM, Orange, and Stellantis underscore Mistral AI’s deep integration within the European industrial and governmental ecosystem. Funding Milestones: Fueling Mistral AI’s Ascent Securing substantial funding is a testament to investor confidence and a critical enabler for growth in the capital-intensive AI industry. Mistral AI has demonstrated remarkable fundraising success in its short history, solidifying its position as a leading European AI startup. As of February 2025, Mistral AI had raised approximately €1 billion, or $1.04 billion, through a mix of debt and equity financing rounds. Key funding rounds include: Seed Round (June 2023) : A record-breaking $112 million seed round, Europe’s largest ever, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, valuing the one-month-old startup at $260 million. Series A (Six months later) : €385 million ($415 million) led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), valuing the company at $2 billion. Series A Extension (February 2024) : Microsoft’s $16.3 million convertible investment, maintaining the Series A valuation. €600 million Round (June 2024) : Led by General Catalyst at a $6 billion valuation, with participation from major tech players like Cisco, IBM, Nvidia, and Samsung. This rapid accumulation of capital reflects strong investor belief in Mistral AI’s potential to disrupt the AI landscape and emerge as a significant OpenAI competitor . Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Mistral AI? The question on everyone’s mind is: what does the future hold for Mistral AI? While acquisition rumors constantly swirl, Mistral AI’s leadership, particularly CEO Arthur Mensch, has firmly stated that the company is “not for sale” and is aiming for an IPO. This ambition is understandable given the significant capital raised and the desire to maintain independence, especially in the strategically important field of AI. However, achieving an IPO and justifying its near-$6 billion valuation requires substantial revenue growth. Scaling its revenue streams, particularly through its B2B offerings and Le Chat subscriptions, will be crucial in the coming years. The path to becoming a truly dominant OpenAI competitor is challenging, but Mistral AI’s rapid progress, strategic partnerships, and strong financial backing position it as a formidable player in the global AI arena. For now, all eyes are on Mistral AI as it navigates the complexities of the AI market, striving to balance its open-source ethos with commercial imperatives and the ambition to be a leading force in the next wave of AI innovation. The journey of this European AI champion is just beginning, and the world is watching closely.

Is this a sign of big moves to come? Let’s dive into what this surge in Bitcoin open interest means and what implications it holds for the market and the upcoming summit. Decoding the Surge: What is Bitcoin Open Interest? For those new to crypto derivatives, Bitcoin open interest (OI) represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures and options, that are yet to be settled. In simpler terms, it’s the total amount of money flowing into these contracts. A rising OI generally indicates increased participation and speculation in the market. Think of it as a barometer of market activity and trader engagement. Several factors can influence Bitcoin open interest , including: Market Sentiment: Positive market sentiment often leads to increased OI as traders anticipate price appreciation. Price Action: Significant price movements can attract more traders, boosting OI. Upcoming Events: Events like the White House Crypto Summit can create anticipation and drive trading activity, influencing OI. Institutional Interest: Increased institutional participation in crypto derivatives can significantly impact OI. Currently, the rising Bitcoin open interest suggests a growing anticipation among market participants. According to a report by The Block, this surge is occurring in the lead-up to the White House Crypto Summit scheduled for March 8th. This timing is no coincidence, as many believe the summit could introduce new regulatory frameworks or policy updates that will significantly impact the cryptocurrency landscape. White House Crypto Summit: A Catalyst for Market Movement? The White House Crypto Summit is generating considerable buzz within the crypto community. Why? Because it’s expected to bring together key industry players, policymakers, and regulators to discuss the future of digital assets in the United States. The potential outcomes of this summit are vast, ranging from clearer regulatory guidelines to potential endorsements of certain crypto technologies. Here’s why the summit is so crucial and how it ties into the rising crypto market analysis : Regulatory Clarity: The biggest hope is for clearer regulations. Ambiguity around crypto regulations has been a persistent concern, hindering institutional adoption and market growth. The summit could provide much-needed direction. Policy Direction: The summit might reveal the White House’s stance on crypto innovation, potentially fostering a more supportive environment for the industry. Market Confidence: Positive outcomes from the summit could inject confidence into the crypto market analysis , attracting more investors and driving up prices. Innovation and Growth: Supportive policies could encourage innovation and growth within the crypto and blockchain sectors in the US. Gordon Grant, a seasoned cryptocurrency derivatives trader, notes the increasing buying pressure since Bitcoin tested $82,000. This, coupled with the rising Bitcoin open interest and funding rates, paints a picture of a market bracing for potential positive news. But what exactly are funding rates, and how do they fit into this puzzle? Funding Rates and Market Sentiment: A Deeper Dive into Crypto Market Analysis Funding rates in perpetual futures markets offer another layer of insight into market sentiment. These rates are periodic payments exchanged between buyers and sellers based on the difference between the perpetual contract price and the spot price. Here’s a simplified breakdown: Funding Rate Market Sentiment Implication Positive Bullish Long positions pay short positions. Indicates more traders are bullish and willing to pay to hold long positions. Negative Bearish Short positions pay long positions. Indicates more traders are bearish and willing to pay to hold short positions. Julio Moreno, a senior analyst at CryptoQuant, highlights the recovery in funding rates across the perpetual futures market. This recovery, according to Moreno, could stem from market participants’ heightened expectations surrounding the Crypto Summit. In essence, the rising funding rates, alongside the surging Bitcoin open interest , suggest a growing bullish sentiment as traders position themselves to capitalize on potential positive announcements from the summit. Bitcoin Futures and Raised Expectations: What Does It All Mean? The futures market plays a significant role in price discovery and speculation within the cryptocurrency space. Bitcoin futures contracts allow traders to bet on the future price of Bitcoin without actually owning the underlying asset. The increasing activity in Bitcoin futures , reflected in the rising open interest and funding rates, points towards a market anticipating significant movement. Market participants are seemingly raising their expectations, betting that the White House Crypto Summit will be a positive catalyst for the industry. This anticipation is fueling the demand for Bitcoin futures contracts, driving up open interest and pushing funding rates into positive territory. It’s a classic case of “buy the rumor, sell the news” potentially unfolding, but with a regulatory twist. However, it’s crucial to remember that markets are inherently unpredictable. While the current indicators suggest bullish sentiment, the actual outcome of the White House Crypto Summit and its impact on the crypto market analysis remain uncertain. It’s possible that the summit might not deliver the hoped-for clarity or positive policies, leading to market disappointment and potential price corrections. Navigating the Crypto Market: Actionable Insights for Investors So, what should crypto investors and enthusiasts make of this situation? Here are a few actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news and developments surrounding the White House Crypto Summit. Real-time updates can provide valuable clues about market direction. Manage Risk: While bullish sentiment is growing, exercise caution. Market expectations are high, and there’s always a risk of disappointment. Implement prudent risk management strategies. Analyze Market Indicators: Pay attention to Bitcoin open interest , funding rates, and other market indicators to gauge market sentiment and potential shifts. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification can help mitigate risks in the volatile crypto market. Prepare for Volatility: Events like the White House Crypto Summit can trigger significant market volatility. Be prepared for potential price swings. Conclusion: A Market on Edge – Hopeful or Hype? The surging Bitcoin open interest ahead of the White House Crypto Summit paints a compelling picture of a market brimming with anticipation. The rising OI and positive funding rates suggest a growing bullish sentiment, fueled by hopes for positive regulatory outcomes and policy clarity from the summit. However, it’s vital to approach this situation with a balanced perspective. While the indicators are intriguing, the crypto market remains susceptible to volatility and unexpected turns. Whether this surge is driven by genuine hope or speculative hype will become clearer as we approach and navigate the White House Crypto Summit. One thing is certain: the crypto world is watching with bated breath.

41259923,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=687778,1741312800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41259923.jpeg,"Forget XRP and Cardano, This Is the Best Altcoin to Buy as Trump Announces a U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/forget-xrp-and-cardano-this-is-the-best-altcoin-to-buy-as-trump-announces-a-u-s-strategic-crypto-reserve/,"Donald Trump recently declared a U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve that includes Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP and Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) as part of the portfolio. Even though the assets benefit from positive market conditions their considerable market size poses obstacles to significant price increases. Significant growth of XRP to Cardano values exceeding ten times their current prices needs massive capital injections that seem improbable. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has recently become a popular project because it continues advancing through the second phase of its presale. The presale funding exceeded $2.2 million while the number of holders reached 4200. Investors now have the chance to buy MUTM tokens at $0.015 because they will increase by 33.33% soon to reach $0.02 during the subsequent stage. Phase 2 investors will benefit from a 300% return on investment because the launch price is established at $0.06. Mutuum Finance allows investors to seize significant returns amounting to 100 times more than what major coins offer because it will launch at $0.06. The crypto initiative from Trump does not enjoy universal support from his base of followers. Bitcoin stands alone as the proper base according to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong for any strategic reserve foundation. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss express their doubts about integrating riskier smaller assets into the initiative because they fear it will weaken its reputation. New investors seeking high-growth potential are focusing on relatively low-capped entries like MUTM as they believe these markets can experience tremendous expansion. XRP and Cardano Stand to Gain, But Are They Too Big to Boom? The announcement of U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve by Donald Trump brought positive momentum to XRP and Cardano (ADA) thus affirming their importance in the crypto industry. The two blockchain platforms XRP and Crdano will gain substantial benefits from the rising institutional attention in the market. The limited potential for significant market gains exists because XRP maintains a market value surpassing $30 billion while ADA stays at $20 billion. The extreme capital influx demanded for a 10x price surge would be virtually impossible for these established projects because their current market caps are extensively larger than less well-known newcomers. Mutuum Finance leads the development of decentralized finance Decentralized finance platform Mutuum Finance has secured widespread popularity because its initial funding during the pre-sale phase exceeded $2.2 million and accumulated more than 4,200 participants. Mutuum Finance starts its Phase 2 at $0.015 and plans to raise its price to $0.06 upon launch which presents potential gains of 300% before accessing major exchanges. The Defi sector recognizes Mutuum Finance as one of the leading investment opportunities because of its rising market position and expanding user base. The advanced lending protocol of Mutuum Finance joins Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and Peer-to-Contract (P2C) models to provide its users with two-tiered borrowing services. Users using P2C model receive passive income from USDT deposits in smart contract pools alongside immediate access to loans through this system. Users who participate in P2P lending avoid traditional payment channels because they can reach direct agreements that improve both understanding and operational efficiency as well as control. Mutuum Finance benefits from merging Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract lending models to support stable investors alongside high-yield traders in its decentralized finance lending system. A Secure, Scalable, and Sustainable DeFi Ecosystem An Ethereum-backed stablecoin implementation by Mutuum Finance includes full collateralization as an enhancement to prevent algorithmic stablecoin-related liquidity risks. Its deflationary tokenomics, staking rewards, and liquidity management mechanisms create a sustainable and growth-driven ecosystem. As DeFi continues to grow, Mutuum Finance is leading the way, offering investors a secure, innovative, and profitable entry into the future of decentralized finance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still in its early stages, offering a rare opportunity for massive returns. With its presale already surpassing $2.2 million and over 4,200 investors onboard, early adopters stand to gain 300% ROI before launch, potentially even 100x post-listing. As Phase 2 tokens remain priced at $0.015, the window to invest at the lowest rates is closing fast. Secure your MUTM tokens today before the next price surge.

So far, BTC has reclaimed the $90,000 level amid renewed market activity. The cryptocurrency surged nearly 10% yesterday, briefly reaching a high of $92,756 in the early hours of today before experiencing a minor pullback. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $90,156, marking a 0.6% decrease over the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Short-Term Holders Dominate as Bitcoin Rebounds—What’s Next? Short-Term Holder Trends and Potential Market Consolidation Yonsei Dent, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, pointed out earlier today a tightening trend in short-term holder (STH) realized price levels, suggesting a potential shift in market conditions. The analyst noted that this development, alongside key moving averages, could indicate a period of market consolidation unless a strong demand catalyst emerges. According to Yonsei Dent, the convergence of Short-Term Holder Realized Price levels suggests that the average entry price of recent Bitcoin buyers is becoming more uniform. Historically, such conditions have signaled either reduced volatility or a lack of clear price direction, leading to a phase of consolidation. Additionally, Dent noted that the 60-day and 200-day moving averages are also tightening, mirroring a similar trend observed in May 2024, which resulted in a period of low volatility and minimal price movement. A major factor influencing Bitcoin’s market outlook is regulatory developments, particularly the Trump administration’s stance on cryptocurrency policies. Dent highlighted that the upcoming cryptocurrency summit, scheduled for tomorrow, could introduce key regulatory discussions that may influence Bitcoin’s price action. The CryptoQuant analyst wrote: All eyes are on tomorrow’s cryptocurrency summit, where key regulatory discussions are expected. Should a bullish policy outlook emerge, it could inject fresh momentum into the market and break this tightening price structure.

Crypto specialist Ali has noted that SOL is currently valued at $141.25 and anticipates a price surge of 13% shortly. This pattern indicates that Solana is at a pivotal consolidation point, with traders poised for a breakout that could push prices notably higher. Meanwhile, a less-known altcoin, Web3Bay (3BAY) , is gaining traction during its presale, with experts forecasting a staggering 3,633% increase in its value at launch. With the presale already raising over $1.6 million, Web3Bay is emerging as one of the most promising crypto ventures of 2025, potentially eclipsing the gains expected from Solana. Is Solana’s 13% Surge on the Horizon? Currently, Solana is consolidating, displaying a symmetrical triangle pattern, a typical precursor to a significant market move. The price initially saw a steep decline, followed by a 12.54% fall, setting the lower edge of the triangle. Nonetheless, Solana quickly recovered, marking higher lows and lower highs, indicating a fierce battle between buyers and sellers. Market watchers are keeping a close eye on critical resistance and support levels. Should Solana breach the resistance trendline, it might experience a robust upward movement of about 13%. On the other hand, a move below could signal further declines, making the upcoming trading sessions vital for determining SOL’s near-term trajectory. With a generally bullish market sentiment and growing institutional interest in Solana, many are optimistic about SOL’s next significant price movement being upward. Despite this positive outlook for Solana, the buzz is increasingly shifting towards Web3Bay, a new crypto initiative that promises even more substantial returns. Web3Bay’s 3,633% Potential Surge—The Investment Gem Catching Buyers’ Eyes Now While Solana’s anticipated 13% rise is enticing for short-term traders, Web3Bay offers a far greater opportunity for explosive growth. This project is transforming e-commerce by developing a decentralized marketplace that cuts out middlemen, slashes fees, and boosts security for users. Unlike conventional platforms like Amazon and eBay, Web3Bay enables direct peer-to-peer transactions, putting control entirely in the hands of its users. Already, Web3Bay’s presale has amassed over $1.6 million, signaling strong investor trust in its future. Priced at only $0.00524 currently, early investors are seizing the chance to buy in at the bottom, with an expected launch price of $0.1959. This sets the stage for a potential 3,633% return on investment, positioning it as one of the top crypto opportunities of 2025. What sets Web3Bay apart is its practical use in the trillion-dollar e-commerce sector. Traditional marketplaces often have high fees, strict rules, and privacy concerns, centralizing benefits away from buyers and sellers. Web3Bay disrupts this by facilitating direct commerce, utilizing blockchain to ensure secure, transparent transactions without intermediaries. With the increasing demand for decentralized solutions across various sectors, Web3Bay’s pioneering role in e-commerce marks it as a key player for sustained growth. Its utility-driven approach distinguishes it from speculative tokens, attracting serious consideration from both retail and institutional investors. Final Say Both Solana and Web3Bay are poised for substantial growth, yet they appeal to distinct investor strategies. Solana is a well-established cryptocurrency expected to see a 13% increase, offering reliable short-term gains. However, its large market capitalization limits the potential for transformative returns. While Solana’s expected technical surge is noteworthy, those seeking more significant growth are turning to smaller, nascent projects like Web3Bay. Web3Bay stands out with its untapped price potential and a forecasted 3,633% ROI, offering a profit opportunity that large-cap cryptos like Solana cannot match. For those who missed the initial rise of Solana, now is the chance to get in early on a promising project like Web3Bay. It offers not just immediate gains but also the prospect of enduring success as it continues to resonate within the e-commerce space. With Web3Bay’s presale ongoing and Solana’s breakout on the horizon, the choice is clear—opt for steady gains with a veteran crypto, or embrace the substantial growth potential of an up-and-coming contender.

Despite facing fierce opposition and an open letter signed by nearly 6,500 artists demanding its cancellation, the ‘Augmented Intelligence’ auction not only proceeded but spectacularly exceeded all expectations. Let’s dive into this groundbreaking event and explore what it signifies for the burgeoning intersection of AI in art and the established art market. Spectacular Success of the AI Art Auction: By the Numbers Against a backdrop of controversy, the Christie’s auction of AI art proved to be a resounding financial success. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key highlights: Total Sales: The auction raked in over $700,000, demonstrating a significant collector interest in this novel art form. High Estimates Surpassed: Many lots sold for prices exceeding their initial high estimates, indicating strong bidding and competitive demand. Top Lot: Anadol’s ‘Machine Hallucinations — ISS Dreams — A,’ a mesmerizing dynamic painting interpreting data from the International Space Station, stole the show, fetching a staggering $277,200. Nicole Sales Giles, VP and director of digital art sales at Christie’s, emphasized to Artnet that the auction’s success unequivocally ‘confirmed’ the art world’s recognition of ‘creative voices pushing the boundaries of art.’ This bold statement underscores Christie’s confidence in the future of digital art sales and AI’s role within it. Why the Controversy? Artists’ Concerns Regarding AI Art The success of the AI art auction is even more noteworthy considering the intense pre-auction backlash. Thousands of artists voiced their strong disapproval, primarily due to concerns surrounding: Copyright Infringement: A central argument in the open letter was that AI models are often trained on copyrighted artwork without proper licensing. Exploitation of Human Artists: Artists argue that using their work without permission to train AI models that then compete with them is exploitative and unethical. Devaluation of Human Creativity: Some fear that the rise of AI art could diminish the value and recognition of art created by human artists. These are valid and critical concerns that warrant serious discussion as AI continues to permeate various creative industries. The art community is grappling with how to navigate these new technological landscapes fairly and ethically. Augmented Intelligence: More Than Just a Buzzword? Christie’s titled the auction ‘ Augmented Intelligence ,’ a term that speaks to the collaborative potential between humans and AI. Is this simply clever marketing, or does it represent a genuine shift in how we perceive creativity? Perhaps it’s both. While the term can be seen as a way to soften the potentially disruptive nature of AI in art, it also highlights the reality that AI tools are increasingly becoming sophisticated instruments for artistic expression. Artists are starting to explore AI not just as a replacement, but as a collaborator, using it to augment their own creative processes and push artistic boundaries in unprecedented ways. The Future of AI in Art and Digital Collectibles: What’s Next? The groundbreaking AI art auction at Christie’s signals a pivotal moment. It’s clear that AI-generated art is gaining traction and market acceptance. What can we expect moving forward? Increased Mainstream Acceptance: As demonstrated by Christie’s foray, major art institutions are starting to acknowledge and validate AI art. This trend is likely to continue, leading to wider acceptance among collectors and the general public. Evolving Legal and Ethical Frameworks: The copyright and ethical concerns raised by artists need to be addressed. We can anticipate ongoing discussions and the development of legal frameworks to govern AI-generated content and protect artists’ rights. New Artistic Mediums and Expressions: AI opens up entirely new avenues for artistic creation. We’re likely to see the emergence of novel art forms and styles that are uniquely enabled by AI, pushing the boundaries of what we consider ‘art.’ Growth in Digital Art Market: The success of this auction further fuels the growth of the digital art market, particularly in the realm of NFTs and blockchain-based art ownership, offering new opportunities for artists and collectors alike. Navigating the AI Art Revolution: Actionable Insights For artists, collectors, and enthusiasts alike, the rise of AI art presents both challenges and opportunities. Here are some actionable insights to consider: For Artists: Embrace AI as a tool for creative exploration. Experiment with AI models to augment your artistic practice and discover new forms of expression. Stay informed about the ethical and legal discussions surrounding AI art and advocate for fair practices. For Collectors: Explore the burgeoning AI art market. Do your research, understand the artists and technologies involved, and consider adding AI-generated pieces to your collection. Be mindful of the provenance and ethical considerations of the art you acquire. For Enthusiasts: Engage in the conversation. Learn about AI art, explore online platforms showcasing AI-generated creations, and contribute to the ongoing dialogue about the future of art in the age of AI. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Art? Christie’s spectacular AI art auction marks a significant milestone in the evolution of art. While the debate surrounding AI’s role in creativity is far from over, the commercial success of this event is undeniable. It signals a shift in the art world, forcing us to reconsider traditional notions of authorship, originality, and artistic value. The future of art is undoubtedly being reshaped by AI, and this auction is a bold declaration of that reality. The conversation has just begun, and the implications are profound for artists, collectors, and the very definition of art itself.

41260387,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137793,1741313721,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Crypto Sanctions: US Secret Service Blocks Garantex Exchange Website,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-secret-service-garantex-blocked/,"In a dramatic escalation of regulatory pressure within the cryptocurrency space, the United States Secret Service (USSS) has reportedly taken decisive action against Garantex, a Russian cryptocurrency exchange already under the weight of U.S. and EU sanctions. This bold move, first reported by TechCrunch, involves the outright blocking of Garantex’s website, signaling a significant intensification in the global crackdown on sanctioned entities operating within the digital asset realm. But what does this Garantex Exchange Blocked mean for the broader crypto landscape, and what are the implications for users and the future of crypto regulation? Why Did the US Secret Service Block Garantex? The US Secret Service ‘s action against Garantex is not an isolated event, but rather a culmination of increasing scrutiny and enforcement targeting cryptocurrency exchanges perceived to be facilitating illicit activities or circumventing international sanctions. Garantex, already facing sanctions from both the U.S. and EU, has been under the microscope for some time. This website block likely stems from concerns that despite sanctions, Garantex continued to operate and potentially enable financial transactions that undermine these restrictions. Here’s a breakdown of the key factors leading to this action: Sanctions Evasion Concerns: Garantex, being a Russian exchange, has been suspected of aiding in the evasion of sanctions imposed on Russia following geopolitical events. Cryptocurrencies, due to their decentralized nature, can be used to bypass traditional financial systems, making exchanges like Garantex potential conduits for sanctioned funds. US and EU Sanctions: Both the United States and the European Union had already imposed sanctions on Garantex. Blocking the website is a further step to enforce these sanctions and limit Garantex’s operational capabilities and reach. Tether’s USDT Freeze: Prior to the website block, USDT issuer Tether froze a substantial $27 million worth of USDT held by Garantex. This action by Tether, a significant player in the stablecoin market, highlights the growing pressure on exchanges to comply with regulatory demands and anti-money laundering (AML) measures. Broader Regulatory Crackdown: Globally, regulatory bodies are intensifying their oversight of the cryptocurrency industry. The action against Garantex can be seen as part of this wider trend, signaling that authorities are serious about enforcing regulations and preventing the use of crypto for illicit purposes. Impact of Crypto Sanctions on Russian Crypto Exchanges The blocking of Garantex’s website and the preceding crypto sanctions have significant implications, particularly for the Russian crypto market and its users. These actions are not just about one exchange; they represent a broader strategy to isolate Russia financially and limit its access to the global financial system, including the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector. Consider these crucial points regarding the impact: Reduced Access for Russian Users: Blocking Garantex’s website directly restricts access for Russian users who may have relied on this exchange for cryptocurrency trading and transactions. This limits their options within the regulated crypto space and potentially pushes them towards less regulated or decentralized alternatives. Increased Scrutiny on Other Exchanges: The Garantex situation serves as a stark warning to other cryptocurrency exchanges, particularly those operating in or associated with sanctioned regions. It signals that regulators are willing to take aggressive action, including website blocks, to enforce sanctions. Potential for Decentralized Solutions: While centralized exchanges face increasing regulatory pressure, this could inadvertently drive users towards decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms, which are harder to regulate and control. However, these platforms also come with their own risks, including security vulnerabilities and lack of user protection. Impact on Crypto Adoption in Russia: Stringent regulations and sanctions can stifle the growth of the legitimate cryptocurrency industry within Russia. While some may see crypto as a way to circumvent sanctions, the risks associated with using sanctioned exchanges and facing regulatory repercussions could deter wider adoption. The Tether USDT Freeze: A Turning Point? The fact that Tether, the issuer of USDT, froze $27 million of USDT belonging to Garantex is a particularly noteworthy development. The Tether USDT Freeze highlights the increasing compliance pressure even on stablecoin issuers, who play a crucial role in the crypto ecosystem. USDT is the most widely used stablecoin, and Tether’s actions can have a ripple effect throughout the market. Let’s analyze why this USDT freeze is significant: Aspect Significance of Tether USDT Freeze Centralized Control Demonstrates that even decentralized-seeming cryptocurrencies rely on centralized entities (like Tether) that can exert control and comply with regulatory demands. Compliance Pressure on Stablecoins Sets a precedent for stablecoin issuers to actively monitor and freeze assets associated with sanctioned entities or illicit activities. This increases the operational and compliance burden on stablecoin providers. Impact on Exchange Liquidity Freezing a substantial amount of USDT can significantly impact an exchange’s liquidity and operational capabilities, as USDT is a key trading pair and a store of value within the crypto market. Broader Implications for DeFi While this action is against a centralized exchange, it raises questions about the potential for similar compliance measures to extend into the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, particularly for stablecoins used within DeFi protocols. What’s Next for Garantex and Crypto Regulation? The future for Garantex looks bleak. With its website blocked and significant assets frozen, its operational viability is severely compromised. It had already announced the suspension of all services, including withdrawals, indicating the severity of the situation. This case underscores the escalating regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency exchanges globally. Key takeaways and actionable insights include: Enhanced Due Diligence: Cryptocurrency exchanges must prioritize robust Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures to comply with international regulations and avoid becoming targets for enforcement actions. Transparency and Compliance: Operating with transparency and actively engaging with regulatory bodies is crucial for exchanges to build trust and ensure long-term sustainability. User Awareness: Crypto users need to be aware of the risks associated with using exchanges operating in sanctioned regions or those with a history of regulatory issues. Diversifying holdings and using reputable, compliant platforms is advisable. Evolving Regulatory Landscape: The crypto regulatory environment is constantly evolving. Staying informed about regulatory changes and adapting to new requirements is essential for both exchanges and users. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for the Crypto Industry The Garantex Exchange Blocked by the US Secret Service serves as a stark and shocking reminder of the increasing regulatory scrutiny facing the cryptocurrency industry. The combined actions of website blocking, sanctions enforcement, and asset freezes signal a new era of stricter oversight and enforcement. For exchanges, this means a non-negotiable need for compliance and transparency. For users, it emphasizes the importance of choosing regulated platforms and understanding the evolving risks within the crypto space. This incident is not just about Garantex; it’s a critical juncture that will likely shape the future of crypto sanctions and regulation globally, pushing the industry towards greater accountability and compliance.

41260557,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=688445,1741314015,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41260557.jpeg,BTC and MSTR crash after Trump’s disappointing Bitcoin strategic reserve order,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/btc-and-mstr-crash-after-trumps-disappointing-bitcoin-strategic-reserve-order/,"Bitcoin and crypto stocks took a hard hit after president Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve on Thursday night, using America’s confiscated Bitcoin from criminal and civil cases. The announcement , made by White House crypto Czar David Sacks, immediately sent Bitcoin tumbling by 5%, crashing to $85,000 within minutes. Strategy ($MSTR), the biggest corporate holder of Bitcoin, plunged by over 7% , as investors blatantly show their disappointment at Trump’s actions yet again, probably because it’s vague. I mean, check out the video below, it’s just Sacks talking. Trump looks as though he has no clue what’s even in this so-called presidential executive order himself. document.createElement('video'); https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ar1EslX5Jpy8bYZ5.mp4 Trump disappoints crypto community — again In a post on X, Sacks confirmed that no taxpayer money will be used to buy Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies. Instead, the government will stockpile 200,000 Bitcoin already in its possession—an amount that has never been fully audited. “The U.S. will not sell any bitcoin deposited into the Reserve. It will be kept as a store of value. The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called ‘digital gold,’” said Sacks. “Premature sales of bitcoin have already cost U.S. taxpayers over $17 billion in lost value. Now the federal government will have a strategy to maximize the value of its holdings.” While many Bitcoin supporters initially backed Trump for his pro-crypto facade, his latest actions have turned the community against him. In a Truth Social post over the weekend, Trump revealed that shitcoins XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) would also be part of the Strategic Crypto Reserve, after promising a Bitcon reserve on the campaign trail. Donald Trump with Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. Source: Tyler Winklevoss X/Twitter Tyler Winklevoss, a longtime Bitcoin lover, said: “I have nothing against XRP, SOL, or ADA, but I do not think they are suitable for a Strategic Reserve. Only one digital asset in the world right now meets the bar, and that digital asset is Bitcoin.” Nic Carter, co-founder of Castle Island Ventures, shares Tyler’s concerns, telling CNBC that the decision could damage Bitcoin’s long-term positioning. “The U.S. is clearly the most important nation in the world, and so their stamp of approval really does a lot for Bitcoin,” Carter said. “But by including other cryptocurrencies, it starts looking more like a speculative fund rather than a serious national reserve.” Now many in the community see Trump’s Bitcoin reserve order as nothing more than damage control, albeit executed quite poorly. In his X post, Sacks said, “This Executive Order proves President Trump’s commitment to making the U.S. the crypto capital of the world. I want to thank the President for his leadership and vision in supporting this cutting-edge technology and for his rapid execution in supporting the digital asset industry. His administration is truly moving at tech speed.” Trump’s actions keep crashing markets The broader stock market also showed weakness after the executive order, as the Nasdaq Composite has dropped by 8% since Trump’s second term began. The S&P 500 has fallen by 4.3% since Inauguration Day. The Russell 2000 sank 9.2%, one of its worst performances in 2025, per data from CNBC. According to data from CoinGecko, Bitcoin is now up 29% since the election, but down 18% since Inauguration Day, Ethereum is down 12% since the election, 37% since Inauguration Day, XRP is up 380% since the election, but down 23% since Trump’s second term began, and Solana has dropped 50% since Inauguration Day. Michael Saylor, founder of Strategy and Bitcoin’s unofficial CEO plus hype man extraordinaire, has not publicly spoken about the Bitcoin reserve news yet. Crypto-loving Senator Cynthia Lummis, who first came up with the Bitcoin reserve idea, said , “We are becoming the bitcoin and digital asset capital of the world. America is so ₿ack. Stay tuned for next week.” Before the reserve was announced, the U.S. government had a long history of selling Bitcoin at bargain prices. According to David Sacks, over the last ten years, the federal government sold 195,000 Bitcoin for just $366 million. If they had held onto it, that same Bitcoin would be worth $17 billion today. Sacks described the losses as a huge mistake. “That’s how much it has cost American taxpayers not to have a long-term strategy,” he said. The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is supposed to fix that problem by ensuring that the government holds its Bitcoin, rather than dumping it at low prices. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is scheduled to appear on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” at 7 a.m. New York time on Friday, where he is expected to address concerns about how the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could affect markets. Investors will be looking for clarity on how the government plans to acquire more Bitcoin without affecting the price, since Sacks said, “I also want to thank the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets — especially Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick — for their help and support in getting this done. Finally Bo Hines played a critical role as Executive Director of our Working Group.” XRP lawyer Johnny Deaton explained to the community that: “What David is trying to tell you is that Donald Trump’s EO is unbelievably Bullish. Scott Bessent and Howard Lutnick have been DIRECTED by the POTUS to find “budget neutral” ways to acquire BTC. Two years ago, we would’ve been laughed off stage for suggesting that such a thing could happen.” In a separate post, Johnny shared an idea that America should allow taxpayers to pay their federal taxes in BTC, without incurring capital gains liability, and the government can take a fraction of each tax payment (.05-1%) in BTC and forward it to the Strategic Reserve. “The Federal Government and the American taxpayer in a true partnership and both win,” said Johnny. Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to speak on “Halftime Report”, where he will definitely be asked to comment on whether the Bitcoin reserve fits into the Federal Reserve’s long-term economic strategy. Bond markets have also been reacting, with the 10-year Treasury yield now at 4.27%, while the 2-year Treasury yield sits at 3.95%. Goldman Sachs analysts are speculating that the government’s Bitcoin policy could lead to changes in the bond market. The CoinDesk 20 Index, which tracks a broad range of crypto assets, is up nearly 40% since the election, but has lost 31% since January 20th.

According to a recent report by Golden Finance, this suspension is now in effect until April 2nd. For those in the cryptocurrency world, while seemingly distant, these global economic shifts can have ripple effects, influencing market sentiment and broader investment landscapes. Let’s dive into what this tariff suspension means and why it matters. Decoding the Trump Tariffs Extension: What’s Really Happening? The announcement of the extended tariffs suspension is significant as it continues a period of eased trade tensions between the U.S. and its North American neighbors, Mexico and Canada. This decision essentially means that for a specific range of goods, the additional taxes imposed under previous trade policies will remain on hold. To understand the full picture, let’s break down the key aspects: Duration of Suspension: The suspension is currently slated to last until April 2nd. This provides businesses with a temporary window of predictability in their trade operations across these borders. Countries Involved: This directly impacts trade relations between the United States, Mexico, and Canada. These three nations are key players in the global economic landscape, and their trade policies have far-reaching consequences. Goods Affected: While the specifics of which goods are included in this suspension weren’t detailed in the provided snippet, tariff suspensions generally apply to a range of imported products. Historically, these have included various commodities, manufactured goods, and agricultural products. For detailed information, you’d typically need to consult official trade announcements from the U.S. Trade Representative or similar government bodies. Source of Information: The news originates from Golden Finance, indicating its relevance to financial markets and economic news. Why Suspend Tariffs? Exploring the Benefits of Reduced Trade Barriers The suspension of trade tariffs isn’t just a random act; it’s a strategic move with potential benefits for multiple stakeholders. But what exactly are these benefits, and who stands to gain? Let’s break it down: For Businesses: Reduced Costs: Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods. Suspending them reduces the cost of importing goods, which can translate to lower prices for consumers or increased profit margins for businesses. Increased Trade Volume: Lower costs often lead to increased demand and, consequently, higher trade volumes between the nations involved. Simplified Supply Chains: Businesses with supply chains that span across the U.S., Mexico, and Canada can experience smoother operations and reduced complexities without the added layer of tariff considerations. For Consumers: Potentially Lower Prices: Cost savings for businesses can be passed down to consumers in the form of reduced prices for goods, although this isn’t always guaranteed. Greater Product Variety: Increased trade can lead to a wider variety of goods being available to consumers. For the Economy: Economic Growth: Increased trade activity can stimulate economic growth by boosting production, employment, and overall economic activity. Improved International Relations: Cooperative trade policies can strengthen diplomatic relationships between countries, fostering a more stable and predictable international environment. However, it’s crucial to remember that these benefits are often temporary and dependent on the duration and scope of the tariff suspension. Challenges and Considerations: Navigating the Complexities of USMCA and Trade Policies While the USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement) aims to foster smoother trade relations, the reality of international trade is often filled with complexities and potential challenges. Even with tariff suspensions, businesses and economies must navigate a landscape that can shift rapidly. Let’s consider some of the challenges and points to ponder: Temporary Nature: The current suspension is only until April 2nd. This short-term window creates uncertainty. Businesses might be hesitant to make long-term strategic decisions based on a temporary reprieve. Geopolitical Factors: Trade policies are heavily influenced by political relations. Changes in political leadership or shifts in diplomatic priorities can quickly alter the trade landscape. Global Economic Conditions: Broader economic factors, such as global recessions, inflation, or supply chain disruptions, can overshadow the impact of tariff suspensions. Industry-Specific Impacts: The effects of tariff suspensions can vary significantly across different industries. Some sectors might benefit greatly, while others may see minimal impact or even face new challenges due to shifting trade dynamics. Long-Term Trade Strategy: A series of short-term suspensions doesn’t necessarily equate to a stable long-term trade strategy. Businesses need predictability to plan investments and operations effectively. Examples in Action: Real-World Scenarios of Tariff Impact To truly grasp the implications of Mexico and Canada tariff suspensions, considering real-world examples can be incredibly insightful. While we don’t have specific examples tied to this exact suspension yet, we can draw from past instances and general principles: Automotive Industry: The automotive sector has highly integrated supply chains across North America. Tariffs on auto parts or vehicles can significantly increase production costs, impacting manufacturers, workers, and consumers. Suspensions can offer temporary relief to this industry. Agriculture: Agricultural products are frequently subject to tariffs. For example, if the U.S. were to impose tariffs on Mexican avocados, it could lead to higher avocado prices in the U.S. Conversely, suspensions could help maintain price stability and trade flow. Consumer Goods: Many everyday consumer goods are imported. Tariffs on these items directly affect the prices consumers pay for clothing, electronics, and household items. Suspensions can ease inflationary pressures on these goods. Steel and Aluminum: In the past, tariffs on steel and aluminum imports have had a ripple effect across various industries that use these materials, from construction to manufacturing. Suspensions in these sectors can influence material costs and project viability. These examples illustrate how tariffs and their suspensions are not abstract policy decisions but have tangible effects on businesses and individuals. Actionable Insights: What Should Businesses and Investors Do? So, with this extension of the Canada and Mexico tariff suspension, what are some actionable insights for businesses and investors to consider? Monitor Trade News Closely: Stay updated on trade policy developments. Subscribe to reputable news sources, trade publications, and official government announcements related to trade. Scenario Planning: Develop contingency plans for different trade scenarios. What happens if tariffs are reinstated? What if they are further reduced or eliminated? Prepare for various possibilities. Supply Chain Review: Assess your supply chains. Are they overly reliant on imports from specific regions? Can diversification mitigate risks associated with trade policy changes? Engage with Industry Associations: Industry associations often advocate for their members’ interests in trade policy discussions. Engaging with these groups can provide valuable insights and collective action opportunities. Seek Expert Advice: Consult with trade lawyers, economists, and consultants to get tailored advice on navigating the complexities of international trade and tariff policies. For those in the cryptocurrency and broader financial markets, understanding these global trade dynamics is crucial as they can indirectly influence market sentiment and investment strategies. Conclusion: A Temporary Truce or a Shift in Trade Winds? Donald Trump’s extension of the tariff suspension on Mexican and Canadian goods offers a moment of relief in the ongoing saga of international trade relations. It provides businesses with a temporary reprieve and hints at a continued, albeit potentially fragile, truce in trade tensions within North America. However, the short-term nature of this suspension underscores the volatile and politically influenced nature of modern trade policies. Businesses and investors must remain vigilant, adaptable, and informed as the global trade landscape continues to evolve. While this news might seem distant from the world of cryptocurrency, remember that global economic stability and trade relationships form the bedrock upon which all markets, including digital assets, operate.

Under this plan, the U.S. government will create a “digital Fort Knox” to store Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies seized in civil or criminal cases. The reserve aims to preserve these digital assets for long-term value, marking a significant shift in how the government handles seized crypto. David Sacks, Trump’s crypto czar, shared the latest development in a latest X post . “The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it will not cost taxpayers a dime,” Sacks remarked. US To Preserve ‘The Digital Gold’ He also noted that while the U.S. government owns around 200,000 Bitcoin, however a full audit of these assets has never been conducted. The new executive order calls for a comprehensive accounting of the federal government’s digital asset holdings. The U.S. will not sell any Bitcoin stored in the Reserve; instead, it will be preserved as a long-term store of value. The Reserve is essentially a digital version of Fort Knox, designed to safeguard the cryptocurrency known as “digital gold.” The U.S. government has already lost over $17 billion in value from selling Bitcoin too early, but now the federal government has a new plan to maximise the value of its Bitcoin holdings. The Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce will develop strategies to acquire more Bitcoin without costing taxpayers any extra money. The Executive Order also creates a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, which will store digital assets aside from Bitcoin, that are seized in criminal or civil cases. The government will only add assets to the Stockpile from forfeiture cases, not by purchasing them. Sacks emphasized that the Stockpile’s goal is to responsibly manage the government’s digital assets, under the supervision of the Treasury Department. Promises Made, Promises Kept! President Trump had previously promised to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile and now, those promises are being fulfilled. Sacks highlights that this Executive Order highlights his ongoing commitment to positioning the U.S. as the “crypto capital of the world,” taking significant steps toward integrating digital assets into the nation’s financial future. Sacks expressed his gratitude and admiration to the President for his leadership and vision in supporting this cutting-edge technology and for his rapid execution in supporting the digital asset industry.

The reserve will hold an estimated 200,000 BTC, marking a significant shift in U.S. financial strategy and reinforcing Bitcoin’s role in the global economy. BREAKING: President Trump signs executive order officially creating a #Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. pic.twitter.com/MiyTAbRkE2 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 7, 2025 David Sacks, President Trump’s Crypto Czar, provided further clarification on the newly established reserve, stating that the reserve will be funded by Bitcoin already owned by the federal government, specifically assets forfeited in criminal and civil asset forfeiture proceedings. “This means it will not cost taxpayers a dime,” he emphasized. The executive order also mandates a comprehensive audit of the federal government’s Bitcoin holdings, as the exact quantity of BTC under U.S. control has never been fully accounted for. Sacks noted: “It is estimated that the U.S. government owns about 200,000 bitcoin; however, there has never been a complete audit. The E.O. directs a full accounting of the federal government’s digital asset holdings.” A key provision of the executive order ensures that the government will not sell any Bitcoin deposited into the reserve. Instead, it will serve as a long-term store of value, with Sacks likening it to “a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called ‘digital gold.’” Highlighting past financial missteps, Sacks explained how premature sales of Bitcoin by the government have cost taxpayers over $17 billion in lost value. With the new reserve, the administration seeks to avoid such losses while strategically maximizing Bitcoin’s long-term value. Additionally, the executive order grants the Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce the authority to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring more Bitcoin, provided that such acquisitions come at no incremental cost to American taxpayers. The executive order also establishes a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, which will include non-Bitcoin digital assets seized in forfeiture proceedings. However, no additional assets will be acquired for this stockpile beyond those obtained through such means. Sacks concluded by praising the administration’s commitment to digital assets: “President Trump promised to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile. Those promises have been kept.” He credited key officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Executive Director Bo Hines, for their role in executing this initiative. This landmark decision positions the United States at the forefront of the global Bitcoin economy. With this move, President Trump’s administration is signaling a bold embrace of Bitcoin as a core component of national financial strategy.

Solana has dropped by 13%, making investors unsure about its immediate future. At the same time, Dogecoin, previously popular among casual investors, continues to reach new lows as people look for other options. Amid these downturns, Web3Bay stands out by collecting an impressive $1.6 million during its presale. While well-known cryptocurrencies face difficulties, Web3Bay’s growth has experts suggesting it could be the next big success in crypto. Investor Concerns Increase as Solana’s Price Drops Solana is well-known in the blockchain space for its fast processing times. Yet, its price has recently fallen by 13% due to increased selling. The price drop to $136 has raised alarms among its investors. Factors like a general drop in crypto interest, profits being taken by large investors, and a loss of momentum after failing to hit new highs are hurting its value. If Solana’s price falls below important levels, it might keep dropping for a while. Still, some believe Solana might recover. If it stays above $130, it could possibly reach its former higher prices. But, the ongoing price uncertainty and general market volatility are pushing many to consider investing in other, more promising projects. Dogecoin’s Struggles Indicate Decreasing Interest in Meme Coins Dogecoin, known for its viral start as a meme coin, is also in trouble. Its price has fallen to all-time lows as enthusiasm wanes and the market turns to projects with more practical uses. Dogecoin hasn’t seen significant new developments, making it prone to further losses as investors move their money to more impactful projects. The initial excitement over speculative profits from Dogecoin is fading, unable to keep the coin in significant growth. With no major new uses or activities, Dogecoin is losing its appeal. Investors are now shifting focus to newer ventures like Web3Bay, which promises real-world uses and substantial return potential. Web3Bay Thrives as Solana and Dogecoin Struggle While Solana and Dogecoin face challenges, Web3Bay is on a rising path, already gathering over $1.6 million in its presale. Investors see the value in Web3Bay’s approach to reshaping e-commerce. By eliminating intermediaries, the platform cuts costs and enhances security for users through blockchain technology. It offers a direct, user-empowered alternative to traditional online shopping dominated by large corporations. Currently priced at $0.00524 in its presale, with an expected launch price of $0.1959, early backers could see returns exceeding 3,633%. The robust demand for 3BAY tokens reflects strong faith in Web3Bay’s future, marking it as a prime investment choice amid today’s market. Unlike Dogecoin, which relies on community appeal but lacks broader utility, or Solana, which contends with numerous competitors, Web3Bay introduces a practical, applicable innovation. This real-world utility sets it apart from faltering assets, drawing investors focused on substantial, rather than merely speculative, returns. Why Web3Bay Positions as a Top Investment Option Recent market lows reveal a clear trend: investors are shifting from unstable ventures to those offering substantial utility and growth potential. Solana’s difficulties show that even well-known cryptocurrencies can falter under market stress, while Dogecoin’s decline underscores the waning allure of meme coins. Meanwhile, Web3Bay, still in its crypto presale , presents immense growth possibilities. As the presale progresses, its future looks increasingly bright. Web3Bay’s model of decentralized e-commerce not only serves a critical need but also promises enduring relevance beyond just market speculation. Early investors who tap into this potential early could see significant benefits. As other large cryptocurrencies like Solana and Dogecoin navigate through fluctuations, Web3Bay’s consistent progress hints at its potential as one of the most lucrative investments this year. With its presale success and growing demand, the window for getting in early is closing fast.

The “budget neutral” purchases would be above and beyond the seized trove of BTC that Trump has ordered the US to hold onto as a strategic reserve. Sacks has confirmed initial reporting from Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett, who laid out the difference between the Bitcoin reserve and stockpile on the social media platform X. “Trump’s Executive Order calls for two separate things — a strategic reserve and a stockpile. The strategic reserve will contain only BTC (the digital asset with the most store of value) using the 200,000 or so tokens already in the government’s possession that has been seized over the years through criminal and civil forfeiture. Sacks says [Treasury Secretary] Bessent and [Commerce Secretary] Lutnick have also been given authorization to explore means of acquiring more bitcoin through avenues that will not cost the taxpayer. Separately, a digital asset stockpile will be created that includes other cryptocurrencies aside from bitcoin using seized assets already owned by the government.” The price of Bitcoin dropped as news of Trump’s new executive order spread a few hours ago. After sinking from $90,251 to an intra-day low of $85,091, BTC is now $87,476 at time of publishing.

According to Sacks’ Mar. 7 announcement on his official X handle, the reserve will be funded with Bitcoin ( BTC ) seized by the federal government through asset forfeiture, meaning taxpayers will not bear any cost. Sacks estimated that the U.S. government holds around 200,000 BTC, though a full audit has never been conducted. The executive order mandates a complete accounting of federal digital asset holdings and prohibits the sale of Bitcoin in the reserve , likening it to a “digital Fort Knox.” Just a few minutes ago, President Trump signed an Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it… — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) March 7, 2025 With Trump reiterating his goal of making the United States the “crypto capital of the world,” the move seeks to improve the nation’s standing in the crypto industry. Additionally, the order establishes a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile that will contain other non-Bitcoin digital assets that have been seized through forfeiture. However, the government will not acquire additional crypto beyond these means. You might also like: Texas House to advance or reject Bitcoin bill by May 24 Trump’s administration is also directing the Treasury and Commerce Departments to explore budget-neutral methods for acquiring more Bitcoin without additional costs to taxpayers. Sacks noted that previous government Bitcoin sales cost taxpayers over $17 billion in lost value. At press time, Bitcoin is down 3% in the past 24 hours at $86,600, and the market has not yet responded to the news. However, the regulation may reduce government sell-offs of Bitcoin, signaling a long-term positive catalyst . This might tighten supply and solidify Bitcoin’s position as a gold-like strategic asset if the government starts accumulating it instead of selling it. In other policy decisions, Trump also signed executive actions delaying tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports for nearly a month. According to Trump on Truth Social, after discussions with Canadian officials and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, goods covered by the USMCA trade agreement will continue to be free of tariffs. Goods that are not covered under the USMCA, such as avocados and Canadian energy, could still be subject to duties.

There was a move above the $2,120 and $2,150 resistance levels. It cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,319 swing high to the $2,103 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,220 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,319 swing high to the $2,103 low. The next key resistance is near the $2,275 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,320 level. A clear move above the $2,320 resistance might send the price toward the $2,420 resistance. An upside break above the $2,420 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,500 resistance zone or even $2,550 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,220 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,100 level. The first major support sits near the $2,050 zone. A clear move below the $2,050 support might push the price toward the $2,000 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,880 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,740.

The cryptocurrency briefly surged to $92,756 in the early hours of today before retracing to $90,279, marking a 0.7% increase in the past 24 hours. While price action remains volatile, market sentiment indicators are signaling a crucial phase for Bitcoin’s trajectory, according to CryptoQuant analyst Woominkyu. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Stop: $75,500? Analyst Reveals Historical ‘Magnet’ Level Bitcoin’s Market Cycle: Entering the Optimism Stage In a recent analysis titled “FOMO is Not Here Yet”, Woominkyu highlights Bitcoin’s Fear & Greed Index, which tracks overall investor sentiment. The index, based on a 30-day moving average (SMA 30), maps Bitcoin’s market cycles to different psychological stages observed in past rallies. This indicator has historically helped identify when Bitcoin is in the early stages of a bull run—or when excessive optimism may lead to corrections. According to Woominkyu, Bitcoin has now entered the “Optimism Stage”, a phase historically associated with the early stages of a strong rally. In past cycles, when Bitcoin reached this level, the market often gained upward momentum, leading to further price increases. However, the analyst warns that if the index continues rising toward the Euphoria Stage, it could indicate excessive market optimism, which has often preceded steep corrections. The key observation from Woominkyu’s analysis is that, despite Bitcoin’s recovery, FOMO (fear of missing out) has not yet fully set in among investors. This suggests that while sentiment is improving, Bitcoin is not yet in a speculative bubble. The coming weeks will be critical in determining whether the market follows past patterns—moving higher from the Optimism Stage—or if external factors push Bitcoin into a correction. Whale Activity In The Market While sentiment indicators provide insights into market psychology, whale activity is another key factor influencing Bitcoin’s price movement. A separate analysis by maartunn, another CryptoQuant contributor, has revealed that whale deposits to Binance have reached a three-month high, with over $7.3 billion worth of Bitcoin sent to the exchange in the past 30 days. These movements suggest that large-scale investors are actively positioning themselves, which could lead to increased volatility in the market. Historically, significant whale activity has coincided with major price swings, making it an important metric to monitor.

The Bitcoin, all obtained through civil or criminal forfeitures, will be stored for long-term value in a “digital Fort Knox.” David Sacks, Trump’s Crypto Czar shared this in an X post . Besides, the order encourages officials to find ways to add more Bitcoin to the reserve, as long as it doesn’t hurt the federal budget. It also calls for a stockpile of other cryptocurrencies seized by the government. While Sacks didn’t name specific assets, recent remarks from the president suggest which ones might be included. This move could give the U.S. a bigger presence in the world of digital assets. US Loses $16B Due To Premature Selling Notably, the U.S. government has been sitting on a large amount of Bitcoin and may have missed out on significant profits by selling it too early. The new executive order seeks to correct this by creating a reserve that will keep these assets for the long term. According to Lookonchain , the U.S. government’s public wallet currently holds 198,109 BTC, valued at approximately $16.92 billion. Historically, the government has transferred around 222,684 BTC to platforms like Coinbase, Coinbase Prime, and other unknown wallets. These transactions took place at an average price of $14,736 per Bitcoin, totaling about $3.28 billion at the time. However, with Bitcoin’s current market price, those same 222,684 BTC are now worth about $19.42 billion. This means that the U.S. government has incurred a loss of roughly $16.14 billion due to selling Bitcoin prematurely. This highlights the missed potential value as Bitcoin’s price continues to rise, reinforcing the need for a strategy that preserves these digital assets for long-term value, as outlined in the new executive order. Market Reactions Bitcoin dropped nearly 5% to $85,000 shortly after the order was announced, possibly due to disappointment that the reserve only includes tokens already held by the government, with no new purchases for now. Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL) also witnessed sharp drops of 4%-8%, as the order doesn’t allow for new government buys of these cryptocurrencies.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|TRADING|ADA|ETH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-07 03:30:17

In a Mar. 7 post on X, Coutts cited historical evidence that indicates notable declines in the DXY frequently align with large uptrends in Bitcoin ( BTC ). He conducted a backtest on cases in which the DXY dropped more than 2% and discovered that Bitcoin had an average gain of 31.6% and a 94% win rate over the next 90 days. In addition, Bitcoin posted gains 100% of the time, averaging 37% return, when the DXY fell more than 2.5 percent. Coutts believes Bitcoin will reach a new all-time high by May based on these trends. When looking at this recent move in the DXY through a historical lens, its challenging to be anything but bullish.

Investors often turn to alternative stores of value, such as Bitcoin, when the dollar weakens. You might also like: Will Bitcoin price hit $100k as investors eye Trump’s crypto summit? The recent decline in the DXY coincides with market turbulence, which has been fuelled by Trump’s tariffs on Canada and Mexico, together with his administration’s renewed push for a national crypto strategic reserve and clearer regulations. At the same time, the upcoming Crypto Summit has boosted speculations in the industry. After recent market turbulence, Bitcoin is trading around $87,800, down 4% in the past 24 hours as at the time of press. But the trajectory of altcoins remains mixed. Although there has been some recovery in solid projects, the market as a whole is still suffering from heavy sell-offs. According to Coutts, the 365-day new lows in the Top 200 crypto index reached 47%, a signal of capitulation typically seen before bullish reversals. If historical trends hold, a declining dollar and growing institutional confidence may be driving Bitcoin and altcoins into a period of sustained gains. Given the uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve’s next actions, macroeconomic issues may have an even greater impact on the direction of the market in the short term.

According to Sacks’ Mar. 7 announcement on his official X handle, the reserve will be funded with Bitcoin ( BTC ) seized by the federal government through asset forfeiture, meaning taxpayers will not bear any cost. Just a few minutes ago, President Trump signed an Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it… — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) March 7, 2025 Sacks estimated that the U.S. government holds around 200,000 BTC, though a full audit has never been conducted. The executive order mandates a complete accounting of federal digital asset holdings and prohibits the sale of Bitcoin in the reserve , likening it to a “digital Fort Knox.” With Trump reiterating his goal of making the United States the “crypto capital of the world,” the move seeks to improve the nation’s standing in the crypto industry. Additionally, the order establishes a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile that will contain other non-Bitcoin digital assets that have been seized through forfeiture. However, the government will not acquire additional crypto beyond these means. Trump’s administration is also directing the Treasury and Commerce Departments to explore budget-neutral methods for acquiring more Bitcoin without additional costs to taxpayers. Sacks noted that previous government Bitcoin sales cost taxpayers over $17 billion in lost value. At press time, Bitcoin is down 3% in the past 24 hours at $86,600, and the market has not yet responded to the news. However, the regulation may reduce government sell-offs of Bitcoin, signaling a long-term positive catalyst . This might tighten supply and solidify Bitcoin’s position as a gold-like strategic asset if the government starts accumulating it instead of selling it. In other policy decisions, Trump also signed executive actions delaying tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports for nearly a month. According to Trump on Truth Social, after discussions with Canadian officials and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, goods covered by the USMCA trade agreement will continue to be free of tariffs.

The asset is currently trading near $141 and has experienced a 5% price drop in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume jumped by 15%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. However, the inclusion of SOL in the Crypto Strategic Reserve might be a key reason behind the growing attention from traders and investors. Additionally, Solana’s superior blockchain technology is another factor driving its rapid adoption. Solana (SOL) Price Action and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, SOL is still in a downtrend and struggling to recover due to current market conditions. It is currently trading below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe. Despite the downturn, the asset is near a crucial support level of $130 and appears to be consolidating within a tight range. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action and historical patterns, if SOL begins to rally and closes a daily candle above the $150 level, it could surge by 22% to reach $185 in the coming days. In addition to all this, investors and long-term holders are actively accumulating the token, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed an outflow of over $42 million worth of SOL tokens in the past 24 hours.

Crypto enthusiasts and investors predict that the RXS will be among the top gainers in 2025 as it is expected to pump from $0.20 to $25 in six months. RXS rises as an outstanding XRP competitor RXS is expected to vie for dominance against the XRP which has long been in control of blockchain financial transactions. Rexas Finance’s RXS has emerged as a viable XRP substitute among crypto traders due to its countless possibilities for expansion. RXS is reportedly about to become one of the ‘hottest’ altcoins in 2025 due to Rexas Finance’s emphasis on the expansion of the tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) pool, seamless financial transactions, and the fast accumulation of tokenized shares. The Rexas Finance platform is designed to streamline the process of producing and maintaining digital tokens—especially those reflecting real-world assets. RXS will employ blockchain technology to facilitate accountable asset ownership and transfer of real estate, goods, and intellectual property. Rexas Finance’s ‘democratization of asset tokenization’ creates a world of possibilities for investors, allowing them to engage in high-value markets with few obstacles. RXS will provide real use cases that solve actual financial inefficiencies. Rexas Finance’s strategy will position it as a major contender in the tokenized RWA sector. RXS’s presale success suggests future significant growth RXS’s presale has shown an amazing trend as it passes through stage 12, with the altcoin generating nearly $46.14 million at $0.20 per RXS. Nearly 90.15% of Rexas Finance’s targeted $56 million worth of RXS set aside for the presale has been sold, reflecting strong demand. RXS’s inclusive vision prioritizes public presales over venture capital funds, allowing ordinary people to join the financial revolution. The altcoin’s listing on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko will improved its visibility and investor confidence, boosting the presale momentum. Moreover, the RXS team plans to list the altcoin on three top exchanges when the presale ends, ensuring notable liquidity and availability for traders upon the token’s launch. RXS’s starting price of $0.25 and a verified launch date of June 19th will likely set the stage for a historic price explosion. Rexas Finance’s openness and commitment to security are among the key factors encouraging investor confidence in the RXS altcoin. The blockchain security firm Certik has completed the assessment and approval of the RXS initiative, which almost guarantees the dependability and safety of RXS’s smart contracts. The degree of examination has reassured institutional and individual investors, thereby supporting stage 12’s presale success. RXS’s strength reportedly goes beyond security to include usability. Both individual and institutional investors will be able to access tokenized assets ranging from real estate to artwork. The RXS asset will be ‘fractionalized’ to allow regular investors to enter previously unreachable markets. RXS price is projected to rise 12400% in six months RXS’s upside potential is mostly created by the buzz around it. Analysts estimate that the token will spike to $25 within six months, representing a 12400x return on investment. Important elements forming the basis of this projection include growing usage, exchange listings, and the broader market upswing projected in 2025. Crypto’s strong utility and adoption has grown exponentially during positive market cycles. XRP rose rapidly during one of the previous positive market cycles, but now investors are looking to RXS as the next breakout coin. RXS will likely be the biggest surprise of 2025 given its increasing community backing. Conclusion RXS will directly compete against XRP by offering an alternative method for real-world asset tokenization, and providing practical use cases for both individual and institutional investors. RXS’s projected price hike from $0.20 to reach $25 in just six months emphasizes a possibility for early investors. Rexas Finance (RXS) is expected to be among the top gainers of 2025.

The US government holds around 200,000 BTC, according to estimates and the executive order “directs a full accounting of the federal government’s digital asset holdings,” said Sacks. “The US will not sell any Bitcoin deposited into the Reserve. It will be kept as a store of value. The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency, often called ‘digital gold’.” Just a few minutes ago, President Trump signed an Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it… — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) March 7, 2025 No Buying More Crypto Sacks also said that premature sales of BTC “have already cost US taxpayers over $17 billion in lost value” before adding, “Now the federal government will have a strategy to maximize the value of its holdings.” The EO also establishes a US digital asset stockpile consisting of crypto other than Bitcoin forfeited in criminal or civil proceedings. However, the government “will not acquire additional assets for the stockpile” beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings, he said. This means that it will not be buying Ethereum, XRP, Solana, or Cardano, as Trump mentioned earlier this week. The concept was ridiculed by several industry executives and analysts after it was proposed by Trump on March 2 because he mentioned a handful of altcoins that many prominent Bitcoiners labeled as “shitcoins.” “President Trump promised to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile. Those promises have been kept,” Sacks concluded. Crypto Market Tanks It appears that the crypto market is also deriding the notion that Uncle Sam will be stockpiling digital assets as it has tanked by more than $200 billion, or 5%, since the announcement, despite analysts calling it bullish . As a result, total capitalization is now back below $3 trillion. Bitcoin dumped $5,000 in an hour or so, crashing from around $90,000 to $85,000 before it recovered to around $87,000, while Ethereum fell a similar 5% to $2,150 after the announcement. Unsurprisingly, XRP, SOL, and ADA were hit particularly hard, falling 8%, 7%, and 10% respectively.

Simultaneously, Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP prices followed by dropping 1-6% in the interim. Meme coins also traded mainly in the red zone on Friday, with the broader sector’s action collectively sparking severe investor concerns despite the latest pro-crypto advancements. Crypto Market Today: BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP Wane Despite U.S. Crypto Reserve Establishment The global crypto market lost nearly 4% value today as the market cap shrank to $2.88 trillion despite pro-cryptocurrency advancements in the U.S. President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order to establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve nationwide. Further, the order also focused on creating a ‘Digital Asset Stockpile’ in the U.S. that consists of crypto other than BTC. However, despite these much-awaited pro-crypto developments, prices today encounter considerable volatility. BTC Price Hits $84K Low Again After showcasing a recovery-like trend, BTC price again leaves hope sinking as it fell over 4% to $87,071 at the time of reporting. Besides, CoinMarketCap’s data showed that the coin bottomed at $84,717.68 over the past day.

Besides, with $259.24 million in liquidations in the past 24 hours, per Coinglass data, Bitcoin continues to face turbulence. Even BTC futures OI slipped 4.6% today and closed in at $48.48 billion, signaling declining market interest despite favorable developments.

The coin swooped to a $135.72 low and a high of $152.78 intraday. Even Solana registered $21.67 million worth of liquidations, aligning with the tumbling action. Meme Crypto Market In The Red Simultaneously, Dogecoin (DOGE) price pulled back nearly 5% and exchanged hands at $0.1967. Shiba Inu (SHIB) price lost over 2% and stood at $0.00001318. Even Pepe Coin (PEPE) price lost 6% and exchanged hands at $0.000006717. Altogether, the meme coin market mirrors broader trends. Top Gainers In The Crypto Market Today Some tokens appear to have defied the fading market trend today, entering the green zone.

41265837,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=708189,1741323630,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,XRP Faces Make-Or-Break Moment Amid Bearish Threat,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-make-or-break-moment-bearish-threat/,"XRP is hovering around $2.52 on the daily chart, maintaining a delicate balance between bullish momentum and the potential for a major reversal pattern. Renowned crypto analyst Josh Olszewicz (known on X as @CarpeNoctom) shared a detailed Ichimoku-based chart, highlighting a possible Head and Shoulders formation. According to Olszewicz, a sustained break above $2.85 would likely invalidate bearish concerns tied to this classic reversal setup. Can XRP Bust Through $2.85? XRP’s most recent rally took shape in mid-October 2024, when it traded near $0.48 before rising sharply toward $3.3999 in early 2025. This rally unfolded quickly, hinting at robust buying pressure and a strong bullish sentiment through the end of 2024. However, after hitting that local peak of roughly $3.40, XRP has pulled back toward the $2.50 area, creating a pivot region that now defines the immediate trend direction. On Olszewicz’s chart, which employs Ichimoku settings of (20, 60, 120, 30), the price hovers near the Conversion Line (Tenkan-Sen) around $2.4750 while the Base Line (Kijun-Sen) sits closer to $2.5749. The Ichimoku Cloud itself projects forward, with Senkou Span A around $2.57 and Senkou Span B near $1.94, forming a green band that suggests broader bullish support as long as price stays above the Cloud. The chart shows that XRP has so far managed to remain above most Ichimoku levels, reflecting ongoing positive momentum despite recent volatility. Related Reading: XRP Price Retraces Gains From Sunday Rally, This Important Support Level Could Be The Defining Factor Within this framework, the Head and Shoulders formation looms as a potential signal of a bearish reversal. The formation appears to be anchored by a head near $3.3999, with potential “shoulders” close to the $2.85 and $2.90 zone. According to Olszewicz, a move above $2.85 should help negate the likelihood of a bearish breakdown, while sustained rejection below that level keeps the Head and Shoulders possibility firmly in play. Market participants will also be watching the $2.0 region, often interpreted as the neckline zone for this formation, because a decisive drop beneath it may confirm the reversal pattern. Additional price regions highlighted by the chart add clarity to the bullish-bearish tug-of-war. The Kijun-Sen around $2.5749 serves as an important medium-term pivot, frequently acting as both support and resistance in Ichimoku analysis. Meanwhile, the bottom of the Ichimoku Cloud near $1.94 stands as a last line of defence for bulls, should any deeper pullback occur. Related Reading: XRP Could Start An Explosive Move To $33 Within 28 Days, Says Analyst Ultimately, the broader sentiment hinges on whether XRP can break above the $2.85 threshold and thereby nullify the threat of this Head and Shoulders formation. If the market reclaims levels above that price zone, it would suggest bullish momentum remains intact. Conversely, failure to overcome $2.85, combined with a drop below $2.0, could point to a deeper reversal and invite further selling pressure. At press time, XRP traded at $2.60.

In a Mar. 7 post on X, Thorn noted that while the government currently holds about 198,000 Bitcoin ( BTC ), 112,000 BTC must be returned to Bitfinex following a previous seizure. This means that only a portion of the assets, a maximum of 88,000 BTC, can be used for the reserve. we think current US bitcoin balance available for re-purpose into a reserve is max 88k BTC, only 43% of current government holdings. that’s bc of the ~198k BTC now held by USG, 112k BTC will be returned to bitfinex market will learn the difference between “seized” & “forfeited” — Alex Thorn (@intangiblecoins) March 7, 2025 According to White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks, the initial Bitcoin for the reserve is supposed to come from seized digital assets, ensuring no additional cost to taxpayers. However, Thorn’s analysis suggests that only forfeited Bitcoin, rather than all seized holdings, can be repurposed, significantly reducing the reserve’s potential size. Thorn also pointed out that Bitcoin accounts for 97.7% of the government’s digital assets, and that percentage increases to 98% when Wrapped Bitcoin ( WBTC ) is taken into account. Trump’s decision to establish the reserve has been widely praised in the crypto space. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong called it a “historic moment for Bitcoin and crypto,” predicting that other G20 nations will take notice and potentially follow the U.S.’s lead.

This regulatory change, he said, would encourage more nations, wealth managers, financial organizations, and even state governments to buy Bitcoin. The end game was never “the U.S. government buys all of the world’s bitcoin.” A U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve means… – Other countries will buy bitcoin – Wealth managers have no excuse – Financial institutions have no excuse – Pensions/Endowments have no excuse – Fear of the… https://t.co/iAoyeo3PYL — Ryan Rasmussen (@RasterlyRock) March 7, 2025 According to Rasmussen, the ruling also lessens the possibility that the US will impose strict rules on Bitcoin. It would be ineffective to ban or regulate Bitcoin because the government actively owns it. As a result, industry experts believe this policy shift fundamentally changes Bitcoin’s narrative. Bitcoin continues to hold its strong position despite recent market turbulence, trading at around $87,800 at the time of press.

While some projects are riding new waves of adoption, others are experiencing shifts in trading volume and investor sentiment. Bonk has been dealing with a drop in trading volume despite seeing price movement, and Shiba Inu continues to solidify its place in the market as adoption grows. But the biggest move of all? BTFD Coin’s presale is turning heads, offering a massive 3650% ROI potential for those who jump in before it hits the exchanges. Meme coins have gone from simple Internet jokes to full-fledged financial assets, with billion-dollar market caps and major utility. While Bonk and Shiba Inu maintain their status among top meme tokens, BTFD Coin is leading the pack among the top new meme coins to buy and hold for short term with its P2E game, 90% APY staking, and referral program. With over $6.26 million raised and a 100% bonus offer still active, investors aren’t just watching BTFD—they’re diving in headfirst. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – Bulls Are Charging as 3650% ROI Potential Gains Attention How often does a presale meme coin generate this kind of excitement? With over 71 billion BTFD tokens sold and 11,200+ investors already on board, BTFD Coin is proving that meme coins can be more than just hype. Unlike others in the space, BTFD offers actual utility, with a live Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, high staking rewards, and a referral program that incentivizes growth. For those looking for life-changing returns, BTFD Coin’s numbers tell the story. At just $0.00016 per token in Stage 14, early investors have an opportunity to see their investment multiply once BTFD reaches its projected $0.006 price. Let’s break it down: A $7,000 investment at $0.00016 per token secures 43.75 million BTFD tokens. Once BTFD lists at $0.0006, that investment would be worth $26,250. But here’s where it gets wild—if BTFD reaches its moon price of $0.006, that same $7,000 could transform into a massive $262,500, making it one of the top new meme coins to buy and hold for short term with explosive growth potential. The hype doesn’t stop there. BTFD Coin recently burned all unsold tokens from Stage 13, tightening supply and boosting demand. And right now, investors can double their purchase with the 100% BONUS CODE (LAUNCH100). How to Buy BTFD Coin? Purchasing BTFD is a simple process. Set up a wallet with MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, connect to the presale page , enter the amount you wish to buy, apply the LAUNCH100 bonus code, and confirm the transaction. Once the presale ends, you’ll be able to claim your tokens before listing. With only two stages left in the presale, now is the perfect time to own the dip and run with the bulls. Bonk (BONK) – Trading Volume Dips, but the Community Remains Active Bonk has become a staple in the Solana ecosystem, with a strong community behind it. Initially launched as an airdrop for the Solana community, Bonk quickly became one of the most talked-about meme coins, leading to a significant price increase. Recently, however, Bonk has faced a dip in trading volume, down 14.22%, despite a 4.03% price increase in the last 24 hours. This suggests that while there’s still buying interest, the momentum has slowed. Even so, Bonk remains an active player in the meme coin market, with many investors keeping a close eye on potential future breakouts. With its origins rooted in community-driven tokenomics, Bonk has successfully positioned itself as a major Solana meme coin, often compared to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Whether it can reignite its rally depends on how the market reacts to its next moves. Shiba Inu (SHIB) – Price Action Suggests Growing Market Confidence Shiba Inu has proven that meme coins can evolve into full ecosystems. No longer just a Dogecoin competitor, SHIB now offers DeFi utility, NFT integration, and a growing acceptance as a payment method worldwide. The Ethereum-based token is currently trading at $0.00001351, up 3.48% in the last 24 hours but still down 7.95% over the past week. While this dip might concern some traders, long-term SHIB holders see it as an opportunity to accumulate more before its next big move. Shiba Inu’s development team continues pushing its ecosystem forward, with projects like Shibarium, a layer-2 scaling solution, and SHIB: The Metaverse set to roll out. These developments could make Shiba Inu more than just a meme coin, securing its place as a long-term investment option. The Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, meme coins continue to dominate discussions in the crypto world, with BTFD Coin, Bonk, and Shiba Inu leading the charge. While Bonk is dealing with shifts in trading volume and Shiba Inu maintains its long-term expansion, BTFD Coin is capturing major attention with its 3650% ROI potential, P2E game, and lucrative staking rewards. With over $6.26 million raised and a 100% bonus offer still available, BTFD’s presale is one of the biggest opportunities in the market right now. Investors looking for short-term gains and long-term potential might find BTFD to be the perfect entry point into meme coin investing. As one of the top new meme coins to buy and hold for short term, its momentum is undeniable. The question now is—are you ready to own the dip before the next bull run? Join the BTFD Coin presale now before prices move up. FAQs Why is BTFD Coin considered one of the top new meme coins to buy and hold for short term? BTFD Coin’s massive presale success, staking rewards, and P2E game have set it apart. With a 3650% ROI potential, it’s drawing investors looking for high-growth meme coins. What’s happening with Bonk’s trading volume? Bonk has seen a drop in trading volume by 14.22% but remains a strong player in the Solana ecosystem. Its price has increased recently, showing signs of potential movement. Is Shiba Inu still a good investment? Shiba Inu continues expanding its ecosystem, with Shibarium and NFT integrations making it more than just a meme coin. While its price fluctuates, many believe in its long-term potential.

The executive order announcement came just ahead of the White House’s highly anticipated industry summit, where crypto leaders will meet with members of Trump’s administration to discuss policy. Many had been eagerly expecting the president to reveal details of the crypto reserve either before or during the event, making the timing even more significant. Industry Experts Weigh In- Industry experts are now weighing in on the potential impacts of the U.S. government’s decision to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Matt Hougan, the CIO of Bitwise outlines the key impacts of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. He noted that this move dramatically reduces the likelihood that the US government would some day “ban” bitcoin. Further, he also believes that this would dramatically increases the likelihood that other nations will establish strategic bitcoin reserves following the steps of US. This means that the U.S. decision to establish a Bitcoin reserve creates a race for other countries to creates a sense of urgency to act quickly. Other nations may rush to create their own Bitcoin reserves before the U.S. buys more, potentially driving up the price. This gives them a limited time to secure Bitcoin at current prices. Additionally, this move makes it harder for institutions, like financial advisors and organizations such as the IMF, to argue that Bitcoin is too risky or unsuitable to hold. It shows that even the U.S. government sees Bitcoin as a valuable asset. “Establishing a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile is a huge moment for both crypto and American leadership on the global stage,” remarked Nathan McCauley, CEO and co-founder of Anchorage Digital, one of the business leaders who is set to attend the roundtable. Criticisms Prevail However, Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, criticized the U.S. government’s Bitcoin reserve strategy, calling it “underwhelming and disappointing.” He argued that without a plan to buy more Bitcoin, the reserve strategy is essentially superficial and lacks meaningful impact, Presidential orders don’t carry the same legal weight as laws passed by Congress, so it’s still uncertain how Trump’s administration will handle the specifics of the order, which hadn’t been fully revealed by Thursday night. Additionally, the exact value of the U.S. government’s current crypto holdings remains unclear.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-07 05:22:55

While Cardano shows signs reminiscent of its exponential 2020–2021 rally, a fresh competitor, Rexas Finance, is carving out its own niche by attracting significant investor attention. So, can Cardano price climb to new heights while this newcomer carves out its own space? Let’s dive in. Cardano Price: On the Verge of a Breakout? Cardano price action in early 2025 has been a mix of volatility and promise. After experiencing a 20% decline, ADA rebounded with a swift 25% surge, suggesting that while the market remains erratic, profitable opportunities could be on the horizon. This potentially poses Cardano as one of the best cheap cryptocurrencies to invest in right now. Analysts are closely watching the critical $0.87 resistance level—a benchmark that, if surpassed, might unlock a strong upward trend similar to the modest growth phase preceding Cardano’s massive 2020–2021 rally. Back then, ADA enjoyed a period of steady growth before exploding by over 2,000%. Although the current rally is more measured, many investors are optimistic that history may be repeating itself. With ADA trading at around $0.85 and forecasts predicting an average price of approximately $1.19 in Q2 2025, climbing past its previous all-time high of $3.10 (set in 2021), and potentially reaching $5 or more if market conditions align. A successful breach of the $0.87 level could catalyze a rally that propels Cardano to new heights, offering an attractive return on investment. Cardano (ADA) price chart Rexas Finance (RXS): The Rising Altcoin In the midst of Cardano price anticipated surge, Rexas Finance (RXS) is emerging as a compelling contender in the altcoin space. Currently undervalued at $0.20, RXS is nearing the end of its presale phase and has already raised over $46 million toward its $56 million target, with more than 90% of the tokens sold. This level of activity signals robust community support and investor interest in the RWA token . Scheduled for a full token launch at $0.25 on June 19, 2025, Rexas Finance is poised for explosive growth. Set to fully launch its tokens at $0.25 on June 19, 2025, Rexas Finance is ready for significant expansion. Certain industry projections even foresee an exponential surge, with the altcoin possibly climbing to $18 by year’s end—a notable projected rise of 9,000%. As one of promising early-stage cryptocurrencies , RXS distinguishes itself from other cryptocurrencies with its creative method of tokenizing real-world assets ( RWAs ). By allowing the tokenization and transfer of intellectual property, commodities, and real estate, RXS is closing the digital and physical worlds. Those wishing to profit from the rising interest in distributed finance (DeFi) and blockchain-based asset management may find this unusual approach appealing as an investment. Rexas Finance Tokenomics Security and Community Engagement: RXS’s Winning Formula Rexas Finance doesn’t merely depend on creative concepts; it’s also establishing a robust base of security and openness, making it one of the new cryptocurrencies to buy in today’s dynamic market. The platform has been subject to a thorough security review by Certik, a top blockchain security company, which gives investors confidence in a landscape where digital risks and breaches are frequent worries. In addition to security, RXS is proactively involving its community with thrilling initiatives. It is currently offering a $1 million RXS token giveaway, in which 20 fortunate winners will each get $50,000 in tokens. With more than 1.46 million entries, this campaign has increased community engagement and awareness. Additionally, being listed on prominent cryptocurrency tracking platforms such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko enhances RXS’s credibility and guarantees its performance is accessible to millions of prospective investors. Final Thoughts: A Cardano Price and RXS Create a Dual Opportunity for 2025 The cryptocurrency community is at cross roads as the year progresses. With its past history demonstrating rallying trends, and current price movements, Cardano price could be on the verge of a breakout. At the same time, Rexas Finance (RXS) is quickly gaining momentum through its creative asset tokenization approach, impressive presale results, and active community involvement. For investors, this dual chance presents an enticing story: while Cardano could spearhead a market surge similar to its 2020–2021 achievements, Rexas Finance provides an exhilarating option with the possibility of substantial profits. Both initiatives, with favorable market conditions, have the potential to yield significant returns, making the upcoming months of 2025 a time to monitor closely in the changing landscape of cryptocurrencies.

Texas has also advanced its own Bitcoin reserve bill (SB-21), which, if signed into law, will make it the first US state to hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset. White House crypto czar David Sacks criticized past government Bitcoin sales, and argued that they cost taxpayers billions by failing to recognize Bitcoin’s long-term value. White House Establishes Strategic Bitcoin Reserve President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a US Digital Asset Stockpile, according to White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks. The reserve is designed to serve as a long-term store of value for Bitcoin, with initial funding coming from digital assets that were seized through criminal and civil asset forfeiture proceedings. Sacks described the initiative as a ”digital Fort Knox” for cryptocurrency, and said that the government will not sell any Bitcoin placed in the reserve. The executive order also created a separate digital asset stockpile, which will include non-Bitcoin digital assets held by the government. This initiative will ensure responsible stewardship of the government's digital assets under the Treasury Department. However, Sacks clarified that the government will not actively acquire additional digital assets beyond those that were obtained through forfeiture proceedings. Before the signing of the order, Bloomberg reported that the White House was expected to announce a Bitcoin reserve at the March 7 White House Crypto Summit. One of the proposed plans included using government-seized crypto as the initial seed for the reserve. Trump later confirmed on his Truth Social platform that the digital asset reserve will include major cryptocurrencies like XRP, Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Ethereum (ETH), and Bitcoin (BTC), with ETH and BTC serving as its core assets. US Government crypto holdings (Source: Arkham Intelligence ) Data from Arkham Intelligence indicates that the US government currently holds close to $17.71 billion in seized digital assets, with 198,109 BTC making up the majority of these holdings at an estimated value of $17.87 billion. The government's second-largest crypto holding is Tether (USDT) worth around $122 million, which is followed by Ethereum (ETH) valued at over $119 million. However, Arkham’s data does not show any holdings of XRP, SOL, or ADA, despite Trump’s earlier statements regarding their inclusion in the reserve. In addition to creating the Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile, the executive order mandates a full audit of the federal government’s crypto holdings. According to Sacks, no comprehensive audit had ever been conducted before, making this a big step toward transparency in the government’s handling of digital assets. Texas Senate Approves Bitcoin Reserve Bill The Texas Senate also approved the Bitcoin strategic reserve bill SB-21 with a decisive 25-5 vote, which was a major step toward making Texas the first state in the US to hold a digital asset reserve. The bill was introduced by State Senator Charles Schwertner, and it aims to strengthen Texas' financial position by investing in Bitcoin, which he described as a valuable and scarce asset. During the Senate debate, Schwertner argued that Bitcoin serves as a hedge against inflation, and compared it to gold rather than a competitor to the US dollar. He placed a lot of emphasis on the fact that the continuous expansion of the money supply has devalued the dollar, making alternative assets like Bitcoin a lot more attractive. The bill still requires the governor’s signature to become law. If enacted, Texas will establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. This move is part of the broader trend toward state-level adoption of digital assets. Initially, the bill focused only on Bitcoin, but in February, lawmakers revised the language to allow for the inclusion of other digital assets. This amendment was made after President Donald Trump’s executive order in January, which directed a commission to explore the feasibility of a federal digital asset stockpile. US States considering Bitcoin (Source: Bitcoin Laws ) The push for state-level Bitcoin reserves is gaining a lot of traction across the US . Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, who is a well-known advocate for Bitcoin, recently stated that states are likely to adopt Bitcoin reserves before the federal government due to fewer bureaucratic obstacles. At the Bitcoin Investor Week conference in New York, she pointed out that while her Bitcoin Act of 2024 has been introduced at the federal level, state initiatives like Texas’ SB-21 could move faster in setting a precedent for digital asset reserves. Crypto Czar Blasts US Bitcoin Sales White House crypto czar David Sacks also recently criticized the US government’s past sales of confiscated Bitcoin, and called it a strategic mistake that has cost taxpayers billions. In a social media post on March 6, Sacks revealed that the government generated $366 million from Bitcoin sales over the past decade, but if it held onto the assets, they would now be worth over $17 billion. He argued that the lack of a long-term strategy for Bitcoin has led to huge financial losses. The issue of treating Bitcoin as a short-term trade was also pointed out by Joe Burnett, who is head of market research at Unchained. He said that Bitcoin’s real value comes from long-term holding rather than trying to time the market. His comments echoed the growing concerns in the crypto community over the government’s approach to handling digital assets. In January, the Department of Justice received approval to sell 198,000 BTC seized from Silk Road, which was a decision that got widely criticized for not considering Bitcoin’s long-term potential. The debate over the government’s Bitcoin holdings intensified since Donald Trump’s election victory in November. Trump pledged to position the US as a leader in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, including establishing a strategic crypto reserve with Bitcoin playing a central role. His administration’s stance has led to renewed discussions on how the government should manage its digital assets. Sacks’ remarks came just before the White House’s first crypto summit , where more than 20 industry leaders were invited to discuss the country’s evolving digital asset policies. Some of the confirmed attendees include Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor, and Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. According to Sacks , the guest list was kept small to encourage a more focused discussion on digital asset strategies. There was growing speculation that the White House may announce plans for a strategic Bitcoin reserve during the summit on March 7. Unconfirmed reports also suggested that the administration is considering reducing or eliminating capital gains taxes on Bitcoin and other crypto holdings. While no official confirmation has been given, Sacks indicated that industry representatives will meet with President Trump’s Working Group on Digital Assets to shape future policies.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|ETH|ADA,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-07 05:25:32

This major step in cryptocurrency policy is set to solidify the U.S.’s position in the growing digital asset space. Bitcoin Reserve Without Taxpayer Funds The executive order establishes a reserve for Bitcoin, which will be held exclusively in a digital stockpile. However, Trump’s plan does not rely on taxpayer funding. Instead, the reserve will be exclusively capitalized with Bitcoin that the federal government has confiscated through criminal and civil forfeiture cases. According to David Sacks, the White House crypto czar, this means no taxpayer dollars will be used to fund the reserve. “The reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings,” Sacks said. Digital Fort Knox: Long-Term Bitcoin Safeguarding Trump said that the reserve will act as a digital equivalent of Fort Knox, safeguarding the nation’s Bitcoin holdings for the long term. In his remarks, Sacks explained the importance of this reserve, stating that previous premature sales of Bitcoin by the U.S. government have resulted in over $17 billion in lost value. This new initiative aims to prevent such losses by establishing a strategic, long-term holding strategy. Expanding Beyond Bitcoin: U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile In addition to the Bitcoin reserve, the executive order also includes a broader U.S. digital asset stockpile, which will include other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, XRP, and Solana, all of which have been seized through forfeiture proceedings. However, the government will not seek to purchase more of these digital assets unless it can do so without additional cost to taxpayers. Global Impact: The U.S. Leads the Way This move marks a milestone not only for the U.S. but for the entire cryptocurrency market. With the federal government committing to hold Bitcoin as a store of value, the likelihood of Bitcoin being banned by the government has dramatically decreased. Additionally, this sets the stage for other countries to establish similar Bitcoin reserves, as global competition for Bitcoin intensifies. Strategic Reserve: Preserving and Maximizing Value The strategic reserve will not involve any immediate sales or purchases of Bitcoin, as it focuses on preserving and maximizing the value of assets already acquired by the government. The executive order also directs a full audit of the U.S. government’s existing digital asset holdings, with a focus on ensuring responsible stewardship under the Treasury Department. Industry Reactions and Future Outlook Industry insiders have reacted positively to the news, with many viewing this move as a precursor to future institutional and state-level adoption of Bitcoin. As this strategy unfolds, experts predict that other nations will closely monitor the U.S.’s approach and may follow suit in creating their own strategic Bitcoin reserves. The announcement comes just ahead of the White House Crypto Summit, where policymakers and industry leaders will discuss the future of digital assets and the regulatory framework surrounding them. With the U.S. leading the way in government-held Bitcoin reserves, the global crypto landscape is poised for a major transformation.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-07 05:26:08

Ripple has partnered with Ondo Finance to introduce tokenized U.S. Treasuries to the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This initiative is poised to redefine how institutional investors engage with one of the safest asset classes in the world. By leveraging the capabilities of the XRPL, this collaboration aims to enhance efficiency, security, and transparency in capital markets. Ripple partnered with Ondo Finance to bring tokenized U.S. Treasuries to the #XRP Ledger. But why should you care? 1/11 — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) March 4, 2025 The Importance of Tokenizing U.S. Treasuries U.S. Treasuries are considered one of the most secure investment vehicles globally. Traditionally, access to these assets is constrained by operational inefficiencies, including settlement delays and limited market hours. As Claver notes, the partnership between Ripple and Ondo Finance seeks to “take one of the safest investments in the world—U.S. Treasuries—and make them available 24/7 with instant settlement.” This transition to blockchain technology allows investors to access U.S. Treasuries at any time, improving liquidity and reducing counterparty risk. Ondo Finance’s OUSG fund, which is already integrated with Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana, is backed by BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund. Claver highlights that OUSG currently offers a 4.16% yield with $184 million locked. The decision to integrate with the XRPL further broadens the accessibility of tokenized treasuries, positioning the ledger as a preferred infrastructure for institutional finance. The Institutional Appeal of the XRP Ledger For institutional investors, three key factors determine blockchain adoption: security, compliance, and efficiency. Claver emphasizes that “the XRP Ledger offers all three with built-in features like Decentralized Identifiers and onchain credential management.” These capabilities provide a strong foundation for regulated financial instruments and reinforce trust in the XRPL as a viable platform for large-scale institutional adoption. Compared to other blockchain networks, the XRPL offers advantages in speed and cost. Claver points out that “when institutions compare blockchain speed and cost, XRPL offers advantages that matter at scale.” This efficiency can prove critical in attracting institutional participants who seek to optimize their financial operations. The XRPL’s built-in decentralized exchange (DEX), automated market maker (AMM) , price oracles, and forthcoming lending protocol further enhance its appeal as a comprehensive financial ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Broader Implications for Capital Markets The integration of tokenized assets into the XRPL sets the stage for a broader transformation of capital markets. Claver asks, “What if entire capital markets moved to blockchain? Settlements in seconds instead of days. 24/7 trading. Lower costs. Greater transparency.” These advantages align with the digital transformation of financial services, potentially reshaping how assets are issued, traded, and settled. Katie Wheeler, VP of Partnerships at Ondo Finance, underscores the significance of this collaboration, stating, “Ondo is proud to bring OUSG to the XRPL, a blockchain that institutions already know and trust.” Trust remains a critical component in financial markets, and the XRPL’s track record of reliability enhances its attractiveness to institutional stakeholders. Future Prospects and Conclusion Claver presents three possible outcomes for this initiative: failure, niche adoption, or widespread transformation. He asks the audience, “Which would you bet on?” While the future remains uncertain, the initiative to catalyze a wholesale transformation of financial markets is significant. The partnership between Ripple and Ondo Finance represents more than just the tokenization of U.S. Treasuries. It signals a shift toward more efficient, transparent, and accessible financial markets. As institutional adoption of blockchain technology grows, the XRPL’s role in the evolution of capital markets will become increasingly prominent. This transformation is already underway, making it imperative for investors and financial professionals to notice.

Data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment shows that crypto whales have purchased a significant 150 million DOGE in the past three days. Crypto Whales Buy 150 Million DOGE This substantial purchase occurred while DOGE was consolidating near a crucial support level of $0.185.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, DOGE is consolidating within a tight range and is currently at a crucial support level of $0.185. Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if it breaks out of consolidation and closes a daily candle above $0.21, there is a strong possibility that the meme coin could surge by 20% to reach $0.25 in the coming days. Source: Trading View Additionally, DOGE’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is near 35, indicating weak momentum, which could be a key factor behind the meme coin’s ongoing struggle. $43 Million Worth of DOGE Outflow Another factor gaining attention among crypto enthusiasts is the ongoing outflow of DOGE tokens from exchanges. Data from the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass reveals that exchanges have witnessed consistent outflows since the beginning of February 2025, suggesting potential accumulation by long-term holders and investors. Source: Coinglass Additionally, the data shows that exchanges have seen $43 million worth of DOGE outflows in the past 48 hours, indicating further accumulation, which could support the meme coin’s recovery soon.

He argued that Trump wants to create the reserve using the Bitcoin the government already owns, but the executive order doesn’t authorize the buying of any more Bitcoin. Schiff later clarified that the executive order did authorize acquiring more Bitcoin so long as it could be done at zero cost. The White House revealed that “The Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce were authorized to develop budget-friendly strategies for acquiring additional BTC.” He also suggested that it meant that “if they seize any more Bitcoin they can keep that too.” The economist maintained that the executive order doesn’t allow the government to buy more digital assets, as buying by definition required a payment. Peter Schiff believes Trump was under pressure to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Under pressure from his donors and conflicted cabinet members, Trump just signed a bogus executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve using the Bitcoin the government already owns. But the executive order doesn't authorize the buying of any more Bitcoin. Look out below! — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) March 7, 2025 Peter Schiff, Chief Economist and Global Strategist at Euro Pacific Capital has disclosed that the President was under pressure from his donors and conflicted cabinet members to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. He called Trump’s executive order to create a reserve “bogus” since the government wanted to use the BTC it already owned. The economist also noted that the executive order allowed the government to acquire more BTC so long as they can do so without any costs. The order authorizes the state to get more digital assets without buying and Schiff jokingly mentioned that the government can keep all the Bitcoin they seize. Crypto enthusiast Ryan Park argued that the order doesn’t authorize the buying of other virtual currencies for the “other stockpile.” He believes that the executive order doesn’t allow the selling of gold and buying of Bitcoin from “I dunno Fort Knox stockpile,” which should not be confused with the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. Park acknowledged that Bessent and Lutnick had also been authorized to explore ways of acquiring more BTC without costing the taxpayer. The tech enthusiast maintained that selling gold and purchasing digital assets from the Fort Knox stockpile does not cost the taxpayer a dime. Euro Pacific Capital’s global strategist argued that selling gold and purchasing BTC do cost money, and the cost of the digital asset is the gold sold to pay for it. Schiff said that paying for Bitcoin for gold was the same as paying cash. Park dismissed Schiff’s claims and said that selling gold for Bitcoin involved opportunity costs and “NOT direct taxpayer funds.” He also suggested that the government’s gold could be stabilized by Bitcoin’s growing adoption but not replaced by it. Park argued that BTC’s value could bolster gold’s role and reduce market volatility, unlike debt reduction, which offered fiscal stability. He added that the government favoring Bitcoin over other assets reflected belief in the potential of the virtual asset “to complement, not supplant, gold.” Schiff says Trump is preventing the market from collapsing Peter Schiff argued that Trump was the only thing that could delay a Bitcoin drop because the support of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could push prices higher. He also stated that the entire crypto market would collapse without Trump forcing U.S. taxpayers to buy BTC and other worthless crypto tokens. “I think the only thing that can delay a Bitcoin meltdown is Trump. He has to indicate strong support for a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, funded by large purchases of Bitcoin. Basically, the equivalent of QE, only with the government buying Bitcoin instead of bonds. It’s not likely.” – Peter Schiff , Chief Economist and Global Strategist at Euro Pacific Capital. The economist argued that a government-backed crypto reserve would ultimately be counterproductive. The crypto skeptic also warned that once the buying halted, the market would likely resume its decline. He also noted that the government could trigger a massive crypto crash if it ever decided to liquidate its holdings. The President signed the executive order on March 7 to establish a government reserve of BTC. Crypto Czar David Sacks revealed the government will retain the estimated 200,000 Bitcoin already seized in criminal and civil proceedings.

Solana continues to assert its presence, maintaining strong decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes despite a downturn in meme coin trading, while also attracting new projects like PAWS, a SocialFi Telegram Mini App that migrated from The Open Network (TON) due to policy changes. Solana’s DEX Volumes Hold Strong Despite Meme Coin Turmoil, Says VanEck Solana’s decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes continue to rival those of the entire Ethereum ecosystem, even after a sharp decline in meme coin trading activity, according to asset manager VanEck. While the Solana blockchain recently faced a slowdown due to meme coin-related controversies, its overall market presence remains robust. VanEck’s March 5 report highlighted that in February, Solana’s share of total on-chain DEX volume surged to over 43%, briefly surpassing the combined DEX volume of Ethereum and its layer-2 scaling solutions. However, this dominance has slightly receded, with Solana’s market share dropping to around 30% in March, while Ethereum’s ecosystem now commands roughly 40% of the market. Despite the decline, VanEck’s head of research, Matthew Sigel, emphasized that Solana’s DEX volumes remain competitive. “Despite the Meme coin Meltdown, Solana DEX volumes are still holding their own — roughly matching the entire ETH ecosystem (L1 + L2s),” he posted on X. Solana’s trading activity took a hit following a series of high-profile meme coin-related scandals that shook investor confidence. VanEck’s report noted that stablecoin transfers—an essential component of on-chain trading—dropped by 80% from January levels. One of the most significant incidents occurred on Feb. 14 when the meme coin Libra, which was seemingly endorsed by Argentine President Javier Milei, saw its market capitalization wiped out by $4.4 billion within hours of launching. Similarly, traders lost approximately $2 billion across 800,000 wallets due to the highly publicized Official Trump (TRUMP) meme coin, tied to US President Donald Trump. Meme coin trading, primarily linked to Solana’s Pump.fun platform, has been a major revenue driver for the blockchain, accounting for around 80% of its network revenue. However, activity has slowed dramatically, with new token launches on Pump.fun declining by over 80% since January. Raydium’s Resilience Amidst the Downturn While the meme coin sector has struggled, Solana’s DeFi ecosystem remains resilient. Raydium, the blockchain’s most popular DEX, still boasts a total value locked (TVL) of over $1.3 billion, according to DefiLlama data as of March 6. VanEck’s report shows that Solana has been a standout performer in the current crypto market cycle. In 2024 alone, its token price has surged by 191%, on-chain revenues (excluding MEV) have skyrocketed by 700%, and stablecoin supply has expanded by 291%. “One of the biggest drivers of Solana’s growth has been meme coin trading,” VanEck noted, adding that Pump.fun generated over $577 million in fees in just over a year. While the recent downturn in meme coin trading has impacted Solana’s overall activity, the blockchain’s ability to maintain a significant share of DEX volumes indicates strong underlying demand. As the ecosystem continues to evolve, Solana’s performance in the broader DeFi landscape will be a key factor in determining its long-term success. With continued institutional interest and the potential for new innovations within the Solana DeFi space, the blockchain remains well-positioned for further growth despite short-term turbulence in the meme coin sector. PAWS Migrates to Solana in Response to Telegram’s Policy Shift In a decisive move against restrictive policies, PAWS, a widely popular Telegram Mini App, has migrated to the Solana blockchain after Telegram mandated that all Mini Apps and third-party crypto wallets exclusively operate on The Open Network (TON). The policy change forced many projects to either comply or leave Telegram’s ecosystem, igniting discussions on decentralization and the future of multichain development. PAWS, a SocialFi project that rewards users for engagement, chose not to be confined to a single ecosystem and instead embraced Solana’s thriving blockchain infrastructure. The transition of PAWS and its massive 80-million-strong user base to Solana significantly bolstered the network’s adoption. Since the migration, over 9 million Phantom crypto wallets have been downloaded, and more than 1 million new Solana addresses have been funded, all before PAWS’ token generation event (TGE). This surge in activity demonstrates Solana’s capacity to support large-scale projects and onboard mainstream users into the ecosystem. The migration also showed Solana’s appeal as an alternative to Telegram’s TON, proving that projects can thrive outside of walled gardens. Additionally, PAWS’ NFT vouchers gained immense traction on the Solana-based NFT marketplace Magic Eden, triggering over 100,000 transactions in just two weeks. The ability of PAWS’ community to seamlessly transition to a new blockchain highlights the importance of a strong product and engaged user base over rigid platform dependencies. The PAWS migration has rekindled a long-standing debate in crypto: value extraction versus value injection. Many blockchain initiatives generate short-lived liquidity influxes through speculative token trading, often leading to capital flight once interest wanes. This pattern has been especially evident in Solana’s ecosystem, where high-volatility meme coins and recent rug pulls have caused significant market turbulence. PAWS, however, is challenging this trend by emphasizing sustained user participation rather than speculation-driven growth. By focusing on long-term engagement and community-driven incentives, PAWS is fostering a more stable and enduring ecosystem. This shift aligns with Solana’s broader push to attract projects that prioritize sustainable development over short-term financial gains. Transforming PAWS into a Web3 Brand Beyond its blockchain migration, PAWS is undergoing a rebranding initiative to establish itself as a long-lasting intellectual property in the Web3 space. The project aims to evolve from a viral Telegram Mini App into a comprehensive Web3 brand with multiple revenue streams and strong community involvement. Key aspects of this transformation include: DeFi Integrations: Incorporating decentralized finance functionalities to enhance utility and reward active participants. Gaming Partnerships: Expanding into blockchain gaming to attract a broader user base. Social Engagement Tools: Introducing innovative features to maintain high levels of community interaction. Multichain Expansion: While PAWS has committed to Solana, future plans include extending its reach to Ethereum, layer-2 networks, and other ecosystems. In addition to its blockchain ambitions, PAWS seeks to establish itself as a recognizable mainstream brand. Real-world activations, strategic collaborations, and increased media presence are all part of its roadmap. Central to this vision is a sustainable token economy, ensuring that community members and token holders play an active role in governance and ecosystem growth. The shift from a widely used Mini App to a robust Web3 brand positions PAWS as a potential case study for how meme culture and viral engagement can be leveraged into a sustainable business model. Its transition also raises a critical question: can Telegram’s retail-heavy user base transition into permissionless blockchain ecosystems? If PAWS’ migration proves successful, it may serve as a blueprint for future Web3 projects seeking to break free from centralized platforms and establish themselves in decentralized environments. By demonstrating that a project can maintain and even grow its user base post-migration, PAWS is setting a precedent for how Web3 applications can thrive beyond the constraints of proprietary ecosystems. As the blockchain industry continues to evolve, PAWS’ journey will be closely watched. Whether its move to Solana marks the beginning of a larger trend remains to be seen, but its decision to prioritize decentralization over convenience is already making waves in the Web3 landscape.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-07 05:30:00
41267014,https://timestabloid.com/?p=59511,1741325425,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"PEPE Coin Volatility Rises, Yet Rollblock Stands As a Solid Alternative to Meme Coin Hype",https://timestabloid.com/pepe-coin-volatility-rises-yet-rollblock-stands-as-a-solid-alternative/,"Meme coin hype is waning alongside a market-wide downturn that saw PEPE coin , in particular, hit hard by the dip. Its price shed 31% of its previous gains in the last month as its volatile crypto market cap slumped below $3 billion. However, as the crypto market descends into turmoil, Rollblock’s RBLK is outperforming the meme coin f renzy with a meteoric surge of 500% since the start of its ongoing presale. Currently priced at $0.06, RBLK is the utility token powering Rollblock’s emerging GambleFi protocol. Here is why you need to pay attention to this meme coin killer. PEPE coin’s wild price wings reflect meme coin fatigue The speculative meme coin frenzy has somewhat died down after endless waves of newly minted coins launched on Solana’s network, leading to unprecedented network congestion. However, after the recent Bitcoin price dip and a ByBit hack of $1.5 billio n in ETH, investors are growing risk-averse across the board, and the meme coin market is no exception. PEPE coin , once a giant in the meme coin space, has seen its market capitalization dip below $3 billion after peaking past $10 billion at the tail end of 2024. PEPE coin is now down 31%, in the last 30 days and a recent transfer of 170 billion PEPE to Binance has caused speculators to forecast further selling pressure. If selling momentum continues, PEPE may struggle to reclaim key resistance levels in the short term. (Image source: Coingecko) Meme coin hype struggles amid crypto market dip The recent market-wide pullback is not only a PEPE coin problem; Bitcoin’s dip below $80K sent a shockwave across the entire crypto market, it has since retraced back to 90k . Meme coins took the biggest hit, as seen by PEPE coin’s 75% dip from its peak price of 3 months ago. According to a market analyst on YouTube named Satoshi Stacker, there is an ongoing move by some whales to manipulate the crypto market. Even so, there is still a glimmer of hope for a resurgence, given the move by the U.S. Federal Reserve to maintain interest rates. This outlook has seen some market watchers anticipate a rebound for the crypto market , with some forecasting bullish price predictions for the PEPE coin. Rollblock’s RBLK defies the crypto market downturn with a 500% surge As the crypto market’s volatile swings continue and with PEPE coin’s struggle, Rollblock’s RBLK has shown remarkable resilience, with a notable uptick of 500% since the start of its ongoing presale. Rollblock has caught the attention of high-profile investors, raising over $10.8 million in the process.

White House crypto and AI czar David Sacks said on X that the stockpile will also include other coins forfeited in criminal or civil proceedings while stressing that no taxpayer money will spent on acquiring BTC or other coins. According to Arkham Intelligence, the U.S. government currently holds 198,000 bitcoins worth about $17.3 billion. Treating the same as reserve essentially takes out over $17 billion in selling pressure from the market. Still, bitcoin extended losses, hitting lows near $84,700, reflecting investor disappointment over the lack of new BTC purchases for the U.S. government. Prices, however, have recovered to $87,600 at press time in hopes that Trump will announce a favorable crypto tax policy at Friday's White House crypto summit. Here is what market pundits had to say about the strategic reserve. Valentin Fournier, analyst at BRN ""The Executive Order has disappointed some investors, as it explicitly states that the government will not acquire additional assets beyond those obtained through forfeitures. This lack of a clear acquisition plan has created confusion, weighing on market sentiment and leading to a 4% daily decline in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana."" ""Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has been authorized to develop a budget-neutral strategy for acquiring additional Bitcoin. Given Lutnick's strong ties to Bitcoin through his involvement with MicroStrategy, this could signal a hidden accumulation strategy by the U.S. government, potentially igniting a parabolic rally."" Dick Lo, CEO of Quant-driven digital assets trading firm TDX Strategies ""Initial disappointment as the market had built up high expectations leading up to the announcement. However, the news is unambiguous positive: It would have been unrealistic to expect new buying without a plan on how it would be funded; An important distinction has been made between Bitcoin and the rest of crypto, i.e. not a single dollar will be spent buying altcoins."" ""Potential further positive announcements to come from the Crypto Summit: more favorable tax treatment towards crypto."" Andrew O’Neill, Digital Assets Managing Director, S&P Global Ratings “The significance of this executive order is mainly symbolic, as it marks the first time bitcoin is formally recognized as a reserve asset of the United States government. Currently, the reserve will only include bitcoin already owned by the U.S. government, specifically BTC forfeited through criminal or civil procedures. The order commits to holding this BTC as a reserve asset without selling it. ""However, the order does contemplate the possibility of acquiring additional bitcoin for the reserve, provided it can be done in a budget-neutral manner.There is no indication yet of how much, if any, would be acquired nor a timeline. The order also clearly distinguishes between bitcoin and other digital assets, which will not be included in the reserve but rather, included in a separate ""stockpile."" Jeff Anderson, head of Asia at STS Digital, said in a Telegram message: ""Market is re-pricing tail risk now that the U.S. won't be actively buying BTC. The BVIV [the 30-day implied volatility index] is down 6 vol points this morning.""This is a running list of comments from crypto market experts and will be updated regularly.",Markets|Bitcoin|Trump|Bitcoin Strategic Reserve,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|FIAT|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-07 05:31:43

The report shows that Solana’s trading activity briefly surpassed that of the Ethereum ecosystem, including its Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) networks. Solana Maintains High Trading Activity VanEck’s analysts revealed that the price of Solana (SOL) increased by 191% in 2024, while its on-chain revenues grew by 700%. The blockchain’s low transaction fees, averaging $0.05 compared to Ethereum’s $1.27, have contributed to its ability to handle high trade volumes efficiently. Meme coin trading has added majorly to Solana’s revenue, accounting for approximately 80%. Pump.fun, the network’s meme coin maker, has also collected over $577 million in fees within a year. However, the market has been affected by concerns about insider trading and automated bots purchasing tokens before retail investors, with the LIBRA coin controversy an example of this. Launched in February, the coin got mired in allegations of insider trading and market manipulation when its value quickly collapsed, leaving investors reeling from millions worth of losses . In that same month, a collapse in meme coin trading led to an 80% drop in Solana’s stablecoin transfers from its January levels. Other trading metrics also declined, with DEX volumes falling by 55%, fees collected dropping by 63%, and MEV activity decreasing by 63%. Despite these setbacks, the network’s overall trading volumes remained competitive with Ethereum’s entire ecosystem. Further, the blockchain is set to undergo multiple protocol upgrades, which are expected to enhance its performance. Ethereum’s Decline and Potential Solutions Ethereum has also seen a decline in revenue and overall usage. Over the past year, gas prices have fallen 88%, and its revenue has dropped 93%. The network’s share of total blockchain revenue decreased from 55% in February 2024 to 24% in February 2025. According to Matthew Siegel and Patrick Bush from VanEck, Ethereum’s strategy of encouraging users to move to L2 solutions has reduced activity on its Mainnet. As a result, major projects such as Uniswap and Ondo have begun expanding beyond the network. Meanwhile, its transaction throughput remains lower than competing blockchains, with a recorded maximum of 63 transactions per second (TPS) compared to Solana’s 4,000 TPS. To address these challenges, validators increased gas limits by 20% in February, raising transaction capacity from 30 million to 36 million gas units. The upcoming Pectra upgrade , set for this month, includes changes to L2 blob capacity, validator stake limits, and staking processes. Additionally, the Ethereum Foundation has introduced Intents, a software update aimed at improving transaction efficiency across Layer 2 networks.

Dogecoin Price Crash Causes Investor Panic The DOGE price is crashing, losing over 5% in the last 7 days. Though US crypto reserves are holding firm, DOGE price is under selling pressure and investors are beginning to sell off. With the DOGE price going down, some investors have lost hope and are looking for an alternative with high potential. As DOGE price keeps lagging, investors are looking elsewhere to DTX Exchange, a 200% DeFi altcoin that is real and viable. Unlike Dogecoin, which is based on hype, DTX is real; it integrates crypto, stocks, and forex into one trading platform. The upcoming $0.36 listing promises early buyers at $0.18 with a 2x profit when DTX launches, and LIST2X offer doubles their stake with a 4x profit before trading goes live.

Despite the bullish US crypto reserve, SHIB price keeps going down, and investors keep selling their SHIB tokens.

DTX Exchange stands out because of its 200,000+ TPS speed, making it one of the fastest trading projects in the crypto space. DTX Exchange’s 2X Listing; The Best Opportunity Right Now DTX Exchange is giving early buyers an unmatched advantage, a 2x guarantee before trading begins.

For investors that look for huge returns with absolutely no chance for fluctuation within the market, DTX isn’t an investment that should be overlooked.

DTX Exchange also offers on-chain order books, and it offers open trades. Token holders with big holdings are given a rebate program by DTX Exchange, which benefits them with profit share.

This achievement shows growing investor confidence in Solaxy’s mission to enhance Solana’s scalability and efficiency. The window to buy SOLX tokens at discounted prices will close as the presale progresses. This presents a timely opportunity for early adopters who can also stake their tokens and increase their holdings while the presale lasts. Addressing Solana’s Challenges Solana has been the most popular blockchain for DeFi and meme coin trading thanks to its high transaction speeds and low fees, which made it a formidable Layer-1 blockchain. However, its rapid adoption has led to challenges such as network congestion and occasional transaction failures, particularly during periods of heightened activity. With thousands of meme coins launched daily on Solana, where even US President Donald Trump decided to launch his OFFICIAL TRUMP (TRUMP) meme coin, the congestion issue will persist for a while. But there is a solution. Solaxy aims to mitigate these issues by introducing a Layer-2 blockchain that processes transactions off-chain, bundling them into one transaction before sending them for settlement on mainnet. This will alleviate the load on Solana’s mainnet, making it usable even during peak congestion. DEV UPDATE 3: SP1 zkVM Proofs: Validating the Future We've successfully integrated: • SVM inside zkVM • SP1 + Sovereign rollup framework • We are collaborating with @Sovereign_Labs to refine the optimistic mode of the rollup & finalize security measures. Data… — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) February 2, 2025 According to the latest dev update , the Solaxy team has made significant progress this week, focusing on enhancing user accessibility and network efficiency. Collaborations with major wallet providers are underway to simplify interactions with Solaxy, ensuring that non-technical users can seamlessly navigate the ecosystem. Additionally, discussions are ongoing with key platforms to expand token launchpad capabilities, making it easier to deploy projects on Solaxy. These efforts aim to strengthen the network’s usability and attract more participants. Infrastructure optimizations have been a priority on the technical front, leading to reduced latency, higher transaction throughput, and lower user fees. Enhancements in on-chain data storage on Solana L1 are also being implemented to minimize costs and maximize efficiency. A dedicated bridge UI using Hyperlane’s repository has begun. This feature will enable smooth cross-chain transfers between Solana, Ethereum, Base, and Solaxy. Once finalized, it will be accessible via Hyperlane’s official interface, further solidifying Solaxy’s multi-chain capabilities. SOLX Token Powers the Ecosystem The SOLX token is at the heart of Solaxy’s ecosystem. Its distinguishing feature is its multi-chain compatibility. By operating seamlessly across Solana and Ethereum networks, it allows users to leverage Ethereum’s extensive liquidity while benefiting from Solana’s swift transaction capabilities. The ongoing SOLX presale is structured to reward early participants with the most favorable pricing, where token prices will incrementally increase as funding milestones are achieved. That said, investors can buy SOLX now for $0.001654 apiece. Note that the price will go up in less than 10 hours, making it prudent to buy early. In addition, presale participants can stake their SOLX holdings immediately for a dynamic yield of 163%. Being dynamic means it drops as more tokens are staked. As a result, early stakers will benefit the most. This could be why popular crypto YouTubers like Danjo Capital Master praise SOLX and believe this could be the best meme coin to buy in 2025. SOLAXY PART 2 – BEST MEME COIN IN 2025? Solaxy’s Future is Here – Get Involved Today! Solaxy’s successful presale and innovative approach to scaling Solana’s capabilities make it a noteworthy project in the blockchain space. As the presale progresses, interested investors can take advantage of the current pricing and staking benefits while they last. With its focus on addressing existing blockchain challenges and fostering interoperability between major networks, Solaxy is poised to impact the landscape of Layer-2 blockchains. Investors can participate via the official Solaxy presale website, with payment options including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Tether (USDT), and Credit Cards. Additionally, the Best Wallet app , accessible on both Google Play and Apple App Store , offers a convenient way to purchase and manage SOLX tokens.

In its third presale stage, The FX Guys raised more than $4 million, and each $FXG token now costs about $0.05. Many believe that FXGuys will outdo projects such as Polkadot and become one of the top DeFi coins. FXGuys Presale Surges—A Potential Game Changer in the Prop Trading Space While many promising altcoins fail to attract notice, FXGuys stands apart by combining prop trading with blockchain tech. Its Trade2Earn system grants traders $FXG tokens , which motivates traders to trade more and builds a self-reliant network. Compared to traditional prop trading firms that demand high initial costs and strict rules, FX Guys provides an easy prop trading funding program that lets traders get up to $500,000 in capital with an 80/20 profit split in the trader’s favor. By removing fees on buying and selling and running a decentralized trading system without identity checks, The FX Guys makes it easier for traders worldwide to join. With a focus on quick deals, users can send and receive money in regular or crypto form on the same day, and the service accepts over 100 local currencies. This ease makes FXGuys a welcome choice even next to top proprietary trading firms, drawing the attention of traders who look for freedom and quick profit. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Staking $FXG—A Passive Income Opportunity Like No Other In addition to its prop trading benefits, FXGuys offers a new staking option. Instead of using standard staking sites, FXGuys lets users deposit $FXG plus earn a 20% share of profits and revenue from broker trades. This method makes $FXG work as a useful token moreover a steady income source, which differs from many top DeFi coins that count only on rising prices. The FXGuys network gives traders many trading tools. Depending on where they live, traders pick from platforms such as FXGuys Trader, MT5, Match-Trader, cTrader or DXtrade. With this layout, FXGuys builds its role as a smart prop trader setup for common and professional traders alike. Could FXGuys Surpass Polkadot in the DeFi Race? Polkadot has been seen as a top choice for connecting different blockchains and helping them grow. As new competitors appear and market needs change, plans that provide clear money gains win more support. FXGuys makes a strong case to lead the market plus gives traders and buyers several ways to earn money through staking, trade-to-earn, and a funding plan for proprietary trading. While Polkadot works on connecting chains, FX Guys changes financial trading by linking traditional prop firms with decentralized finance. Users gain $FXG through trades without any buy or sell tax and receive funds instantly, which makes FX Guys an appealing option to traders and DeFi fans. Polkadot’s importance in the market might be tested if growth continues at this rate. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Final Thoughts With a new presale stage that broke records and more than $4 million raised so far, FXGuys shows itself as one altcoin with great promise. Its new staking plan, quick funding business setup, and no kyc trading system make it a turning point in the top space of decentralized finance tokens. Even though beating Polkadot is hard, The FX Guys have placed themselves as a leading PropFi project that may change the way trading and money work without central control.

Below is an overview of five tokens poised for potential growth.​ Each project offers something unique – a high-risk, high-reward approach tied to Bitcoin’s trajectory, an innovative Layer-2 solution for Solana, or a bridge between traditional finance and DeFi. We explore each token, breaking down its features and explaining why it might be the next big opportunity for early investors. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) With the recent announcement of a US Strategic Crypto Reserve, the BTC Bull Token could be the main beneficiary. This meme-based cryptocurrency is designed to capitalize on Bitcoin’s projected ascent to $1 million. By holding BTCBULL, investors can earn BTC and BTCBULL tokens as Bitcoin reaches specific price milestones, such as $150k, $200k, and $250k. The token’s structure also includes token burn mechanics when BTC trades at $125k, $175k, and $225k. The goal is to reduce the token supply by 15% and potentially increase the token’s value. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, BTCBULL ensures global accessibility and compatibility with various Ethereum wallets, simplifying trading and staking processes. Thanks to its partnership with Best Wallet , users can buy BTCBULL with a card and receive BTC airdrops in the same wallet account. While the presale lasts, early investors can earn even more BTCBULL tokens via staking. With a dynamic APY of 132%, this could be an excellent opportunity to increase holdings without making new purchases. Visit BTC Bull Token Solaxy (SOLX) As Solana slowly became the leading blockchain for decentralized finance and meme coin trading, issues like failed transactions during network congestion became apparent. Solaxy offers a Layer-2 solution for the Solana blockchain to address these issues, aiming to improve the blockchain for everyday users. The way it works is that Solaxy bundles multiple transactions into one and sends them for settlement on Solana. This means no failed transactions, even at peak congestion, and meme coin trading can continue with ease. SOLAXY PART 2 – BEST MEME COIN IN 2025? The native token, SOLX, operates across the Ethereum and Solana networks, bridging liquidity and efficiency between these ecosystems. Investors can buy the token with ETH and SOL during the presale. The ongoing SOLX presale offers early investors access to tokens at a discounted price of $0.001654. Staking options are available during this phase to reward early supporters. Solaxy’s innovative approach could make it a significant player in the blockchain space, especially for those looking to leverage Solana’s capabilities without its current limitations. Visit Solaxy Jupiter (JUP) When newcomers want to swap tokens on Solana, they will likely stumble on Jupiter. What started as a simple aggregator that brought users the best prices from decentralized exchanges and liquidity pools has become a leading exchange with multiple utilities. Users can swap tokens, set limit or recurring orders, or use Jupiter’s perpetual futures to trade SOL, ETH, and BTC with leverage in a fully decentralized way. Moreover, a so-called “Trenches” platform was launched by Jupiter to help meme coin traders find the best meme coins in real time. The JUP token is a governance token that gives voting rights to holders who stake it. Voting is incentivized with more JUP tokens and other tokens from projects that use the Jupiter launchpad. Popular Solana projects like Zeus, deBridge, Sanctum, and many more have used the launch pad in the past. Even OFFICIAL TRUMP (TRUMP) used Jupiter’s infrastructure to launch the token. With ambitious plans for the future, such as the Giant Unifit Market (GUM) initiative, where everything will be tokenized and traded in one spot, and the JupNet, an omnichannel network that will aggregate all crypto in one decentralized ledger, the future for JUP holders looks bright. Ondo Finance (ONDO) Ondo Finance continues to bridge traditional finance with decentralized finance by offering tokenized real-world assets, such as US Treasuries. Further strengthening its infrastructure, Ondo Finance introduced the Ondo Chain, a Layer-1 blockchain specifically built to support tokenized real-world assets. This development addresses challenges RWAs face, such as compatibility issues with decentralized finance platforms and inadequate safety on existing networks, thereby expanding the project’s potential use cases. Ondo Finance also launched Ondo Global Markets (Ondo GM), a blockchain-based platform designed to bring traditional financial assets like equities, bonds, and ETFs on the blockchain, enhancing accessibility and efficiency. The ONDO token functions as the governance token within the Ondo decentralized autonomous organization. It grants holders rights related to the platform’s protocols, including Flux Finance. Best Wallet Token (BEST) With thousands of new tokens emerging daily on various blockchains, crypto investors often find it a hassle to store them all in one place. Best Wallet and its BEST token solve this by offering a multi-chain, non-custodial way to store coins and tokens. This is the fastest-growing crypto wallet, aiming to capture a substantial market share by 2026. That could happen, given that the platform offers features like fiat onramp and offramp, integrated multi-chain DEX, and access to new and vetted presales. BestWallet Is The Best Crypto Wallet And Hottest Crypto Launchpad Of 2025! To further improve users’ experience, the BEST token, which is now sold at a discount during its presale, offers reduced transaction fees, early access to new projects at Stage 0, higher staking rewards via Best Wallet’s staking aggregator, and governance rights for token holders. Early investors benefit from staking rewards during the presale, which has a dynamic yield of 147%.

41270465,https://nulltx.com/?p=146700,1741332127,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Binance Sees Massive Inflows Following Bybit Hack as CZ Reflects on Ethereum Miss,https://nulltx.com/binance-sees-massive-inflows-following-bybit-hack-as-cz-reflects-on-ethereum-miss/,"The world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance , has experienced a net inflow surge lately. Between February 21 and February 27, 2025, however, Binance made out much better than any other exchange. It attracted an astonishing total of $3.971 billion in net inflows during that brief period. For context, nine other major exchanges drew in together only $396.83 million for the same period (they raised half a billion altogether, but Binance snared a steep chunk of that almost all to itself). So, we can see pretty clearly that Binance is going up amidst a broadly declining situation where investors are moving away from centralized exchanges. Binance Dominates in February 2025, Outpacing Competitors The data from February 2025 really emphasizes the fact that Binance is clearly the leader in this market. During that month, Binance’s net inflow was of $5.323 billion. The other nine exchanges combined had a net inflow of $1.229 billion, which made their monthly net inflow 4.33 times smaller than Binance’s. This was a gap that could hardly be seen on the second place exchange, Bitfinex, which had a net inflow of $768.19 million. Capital pouring into Binance coincides with the latest market trend. Data from DefiLlama shows that for the last many months in a row, Binance has been racking up net inflows of well over $3 billion a month. In the month of November alone, Binance hit its peak with a net inflow of I can’t say the exact amount in my own words, but it was definitely well north of $9 billion. The latest inflows were sort of a back-to-back after Binance also saw the inflows after the Bybit hack at the last part of October, which seems the inflows in general and also seems like a sign of GUD trust and a sign of confidence because even in times of market turbulence, we still see traders and investors placing their funds into Binance. The picture that the data paints is one of Binance’s overwhelming market share, particularly in contrast to its competitors. Exchanges that are seen to be in direct competition with Binance on a regular basis seem to have experienced nowhere near the level of inflows that Binance has. In fact, it seems that Binance’s competitors have experienced—if anything—a bit of outflow. CZ Reflects on Missed Ethereum Opportunity In a recent community question-and-answer session, Binance’s chief executive, Changpeng Zhao, took queries from the public that spanned a broad spectrum, including some of a personal nature, like how much Ethereum Zhao himself holds. Zhao said he doesn’t hold much Ether, and hasn’t in some time, maybe because he lost access to older wallets that hold some. “I have a very small amount, and it is really in my very old wallets,” Zhao said. His response seemed to hint at two issues: Zhao’s poor memory when it comes to wallets, and the poor user interface for Ethereum wallets (in which it is easier to lose track of a wallet than with other digital assets). CZ went on to frankly confess that he overlooked an early chance to put money into Ethereum. He remembered his first meeting with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin at a Bitcoin conference in 2013. He recollected the years that came after, learning about Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) in 2014 and how, in 2015, Vitalik had briefly crashed at his Tokyo apartment. Yet, despite this close-to-home tie to the up-and-coming project, CZ confessed to being skeptical about the blockchain’s having a Turing-complete language—a concept that Vitalik had confidently asserted was doable. Defillama reveals that Binance recorded $3.971 billion in net inflows from Feb. 21-27, 2025 following the Bybit hacking incident. In February, Binance recorded net inflows of $5.323 billion. Binance recorded over $3 billion in net inflows in six of the past 12 months, with… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 5, 2025 Looking back, CZ recognized that this mistake was a big one. He joked that had he plowed some money into Ethereum, it might have stopped him from doing a complete 180 and launching Binance and BNB. But, in all seriousness, CZ sees this and other close-call moments as teaching tools—lessons that help him make better decisions in the future. And that Ethereum thing, as it turns out, was an industry-level close call. Vitalik’s Innovations and the Crypto Landscape CZ also reflected on Ethereum and recognized the many contributions made by Vitalik Buterin to the blockchain space. He lauded Vitalik for his innovative thinking and for what he called groundbreaking innovations. For CZ, these innovations are enormously important. They are not only big ideas but also play a huge role in the advancement of the crypto industry. They include the introduction of smart contracts, ERC20 tokens, NFTs, soulbound tokens (SBTs), and Layer 2 solutions. Even though investing in Ethereum was a golden opportunity that the Binance chief missed, he still remains appreciative of what Vitalik Buterin has done and is doing for digital currency. It is shaping the future of “decentralized everything,” in CZ’s words. The Binance chief is an admirer of Buterin and is a lifelong learner in the blockchain industry. He emphasizes the need to keep evolving and adapting to new developments in this sector. Binance’s Continued Growth and Future Prospects Although he may think sometimes about those opportunities that he could have taken, Binance is in an upward path. We see that clearly now in net inflows and in the trust that users have in the platform when times get tough in the crypto market. The success that Binance itself has achieved, along with the platform’s ongoing development of the BNB ecosystem, speaks to the current dominance that CZ’s platform has in the crypto space. As capital continues to flow into Binance, particularly in these unpredictable market conditions, it is obvious that the exchange is one of the leaders in the global cryptocurrency scene. For CZ, which I guess is not really a surprise anymore after last week’s CoinDesk interview, the clear lesson to take away from the past is to be thankful for the successes while also learning from the failures to maintain and build upon that success in the years to come. As Binance’s worldwide sway increases, Changpeng Zhao and his team will almost certainly have to confront fresh problems and prospects in the developing domain of blockchain and digital currency. Yet for all the talk, and even some evidence, that a new era of centralized financial power is upon us, Binance remains in no way part of that story. In fact, by the very nature of its being, Binance contradicts it. Here are the reasons why. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The EO directs a full accounting of the federal government’s digital asset holdings. Sacks highlighted the U.S. government’s estimated 200,000 BTC stash obtained through criminal seizures, bringing the initial estimated reserve value to $17.7 billion. “Premature sales of Bitcoin have already cost U.S. taxpayers over $17 billion in lost value. Now the federal government will have a strategy to maximize the value of its holdings,” Sacks wrote. In a video showing the president signing the order , Trump states about creating the reserve, “Made the promise, right?” https://twitter.com/MargoMartin47/status/1897802829474955415 Trump initially pledged to set up a Bitcoin stockpile held by the U.S. Government back in July 2024 in a bid to curry favor with Bitcoin fans on the campaign trail. A March 6 fact sheet from the White House noted that the order also establishes a “U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile,” which Sacks said would include cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. However, he did not mention any particular assets in that category — despite some being recently named by President Trump . Sacks indicated that the purpose of the stockpile is to ensure “responsible stewardship of the government’s digital assets under the Treasury Department.” He clarified that the government would not acquire additional assets for the stockpile beyond those obtained through forfeiture proceedings. Market Reaction BTC fell from $90,251 to $85,091 in less than an hour after Trump signed the executive order, perhaps because of disappointment that the reserve and stockpile do not include new crypto buys. According to CoinGecko, it has since rebounded slightly to $87,923 as of publication time, still down 4.5% on the day. Charles Edwards, founder of the Bitcoin-focused hedge fund Capriole Investments, described it as the “most underwhelming and disappointing outcome we could have expected for this week.” He contends that without a buying plan, the strategy is a “pig in lipstick.” However, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan posited that the move to create a Bitcoin reserve reduces the possibility that the government would try to ban the asset and “dramatically increases the likelihood that other nations will establish strategic Bitcoin reserves. Meanwhile, the executive order announcement was made on the eve of the much-anticipated digital asset summit , in which crypto executives are set to discuss policy matters with members of Trump’s government in Washington D.C. on Friday afternoon.",Cryptocurrency|News|Donald Trump|USA,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-07 07:23:04
41270594,https://nulltx.com/?p=146699,1741332264,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Aave Proposes New sGHO Savings Product to Enhance Yield Earning Opportunities for Users,https://nulltx.com/aave-proposes-new-sgho-savings-product-to-enhance-yield-earning-opportunities-for-users/,"Aave , one of the foremost decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, has announced plans to roll out a new savings product called sGHO aimed at providing GHO holders a compelling way to earn a yield. The low-risk offering will sit atop the GHO stablecoin, which, like its DeFi counterpart DAI, is collateralized in a way that ensures it retains its peg for the foreseeable future. The product offers low risk and high yield opportunities to users. The yield is based on two components: the native Aave lending rate and an incentivized rate derived from GHO borrow revenue (which we dive into more below). This new offering is expected to become the on-chain savings rate for Aave users, and particularly attracts new users to the Aave ecosystem who may be looking for simpler ways to participate in on-chain opportunities. What is sGHO and How Does it Work? sGHO is a new savings product that allows users to earn yield on their GHO holdings without the complexity of high-risk strategies often associated with DeFi products. GHO, Aave’s native stablecoin, will be the underlying asset of this savings product, which aims to attract users seeking a reliable and straightforward way to earn passive income. In contrast to a range of traditional savings products, sGHO will not impose any deposit or withdrawal fees, making it a choice for the cost-averse that live in the DeFi world. sGHO is a savings vehicle that allows users to participate in the Aave ecosystem (and the greater DeFi world) while earning yields and avoiding costs. Unlike the earlier Aave market, where users would have to manually manage their deposits and withdrawals and where the Aave team would have to set risk parameters for the Aave price oracle, Aave has now made checking off both boxes (cost-avoidance and earnings manifestations) and doing so in a customer-friendly way quite simple and quite safe. According to the Aave team, their latest product will unveil an on-chain savings rate pegged to a stable asset, and this savings rate will be much more user-friendly than existing alternatives. When it comes to DeFi, users typically find themselves facing strategies that require sophisticated levels of know-how and commitment. And under those circumstances, it’s hard to pin down any single user interface that’s intuitive and easy to use. In this context, sGHO could be seen as a front porch that invites users to come into the greater Aave ecosystem. Growth Expectations and Revenue Comparison The growth of sGHO is expected to be significant, according to Stani Kulechov, founder of Aave. Kulechov forecasts that sGHO could generate between $300 million and $500 million in outstanding GHO. For comparison, Kulechov said, “With GHO, the Aave DAO’s top-line revenue is already looking very good, and this is something that decentralized on-chain protocols need: stable, reliable, and transparent on-chain revenues. GHO is rewarding the Aave DAO as if it were a stablecoin. And it is almost a parallel money printer relative to the stablecoins that are with USDC for the Aave DAO.” (Kulechov, of course, is not objective.) GHO will not only provide a new way for Aave users to earn yield but also help to drive greater demand and adoption for GHO. By linking the stablecoin to the savings product and offering an attractive yield, Aave is positioning GHO as a core asset within its ecosystem, while also enhancing the appeal of the protocol to a wider range of users. Aave is proposing to create sGHO savings product by introducing Aave Savings Rate (ASR). sGHO is a new low-end risk profile savings product for earning yield on GHO based on native aave lending rate and incentivized rate collected partially from GHO borrow revenue. No withdrawal… — Stani.eth (@StaniKulechov) March 5, 2025 Aave’s Vision for the Future of On-Chain Savings Aave’s vision of a future with accessible and sustainable financial products on the blockchain pushes forward once more with the sGHO savings product. With this, Aave has now introduced a savings rate for users in the context of what DeFi protocols are doing more and more often these days: offering financial services that are simpler, clearer, and more tailored to the average user. In the introduction of sGHO, Aave takes on quite an uncontroversial and obviously beneficial role by providing users with a straightforward, low-risk structuring of their holdings that allows them to earn yield. Decentralized finance is gaining interest, and there’s a growing demand from the market for yield-bearing products. Why should that be a way to attract capital into Aave?” With the Aave sGHO product, we see this simple, low-risk, high-yield product that to me is a compelling option for both seasoned capital allocators and newcomers to DeFi. As far as what we’re calling corner solutions in DeFi, sGHO is one of those because it is serving a very basic function with much higher and better risk-reward dynamics than can be found in the bank. Aave is establishing a new benchmark for on-chain savings by providing a straightforward savings product devoid of the intricate details and dangers that usually come with DeFi. Instead of a savings account, you have sGHO; in lieu of an interest rate, you get a yield. As the DeFi ecosystem evolves, new products will inevitably help with the transition from traditional finance to this new world. sGHO is one such product. Conclusion Aave’s proposed sGHO savings product is an important new component in the DeFi space, offering users a way to earn yield on their GHO holdings that is as close to low-risk as seems possible in the DeFi ecosystem. With its straightforward structure, appealing returns, and the lack of any kind of fees, sGHO is a contender to become a Go-To savings product on Aave, an alternative to staked AAVE and a clear use case for GHO that touches upon the Federal Reserve’s prohibition on private stablecoins.

Decentralized finance ‘s total value locked fell by nearly 23% in February, dropping from $217 billion to $168 billion as market volatility, liquidity shifts, and capital outflows pressured key protocols, says DappRadar’s analyst Sara Gherghelas. In a recent research report , Gherghelas pointed out that Ethereum ( ETH ), which holds nearly 60% of DeFi’s liquidity, saw its TVL fall 27% to $97 billion in February. The decline was mainly due to lower liquidity in liquid staking protocols, the analyst notes. However, despite the decline, Ethereum’s dominance in this area “remains unchallenged,” per Gherghelas. TVL of the top networks | Source: DappRadar Solana ( SOL ) suffered the largest losses in February as its TVL dropped by more than 30% to $15.4 billion. The decline came after a strong January and was likely driven by “profit-taking and liquidity migration toward more stable DeFi environments,” says the DappRadar analyst. On top of that, activity also slowed on key Solana-based platforms like crypto exchange Jupiter and Raydium. While most major chains faced challenges, Berachain ( BERA ) turned out to be one of the few winners, reaching a TVL of $5.05 billion, according to data. “The chain’s rise is fueled by its proof-of-liquidity model, which has attracted users through lucrative liquid staking and yield farming incentives. As users seek high returns despite broader market declines, Berachain is positioning itself as a key player in the evolving DeFi landscape.” Sara Gherghelas You might also like: Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade on Sepolia encounters issues BNB Chain ( BNB ) saw a smaller drop of 11%, helped by stablecoin trading. Meanwhile, TRON’s ( TRX ) TVL fell 29%, likely due to weaker demand for Tether’s ( USDT ) transactions. Aptos ( APT ) was also one of the rare gainers, increasing its TVL by 6% to $1.83 billion. Ethereum’s drop in TVL comes as futures open interest in key cryptocurrencies also fell sharply. As crypto.news reported, traders have started reducing long positions, with futures open interest falling amid concerns over the trade war and the Fed’s tough stance. Matrixport analysts believe many traders are waiting for clearer signals before re-entering the market. While the upcoming Pectra upgrade, which aims to improve network functionality and fee efficiency, could provide a short-term boost, it’s unclear whether these upgrades will be enough to reverse the decline in DeFi activity.

Trump announced his forthcoming NFT , which led to some price action in various cryptocurrencies, including Solana. The Solana ecosystem saw some moonshots as institutional developments started to pour in. One of the high points—and there were many—was the alliance between Solana and Discord. Altogether, the week had some ups and downs. But by the end of it, the Solana ecosystem is well intact, with the token’s price sitting at $137. Solana’s Seesaw Week: Price Surges and Falls High-profile announcements that send the market into overdrive largely dictate Solana’s price movements. A strategic reserve statement from Trump had a profound impact, causing the price of SOL to surge from $140 to $178 almost overnight. However, the euphoria was short-lived, with gains quickly wiped out a day later amid the renewed national security concerns that have dogged the former president as of late. So, was Solana a loser this week? Not necessarily. It was a stable ride. Despite the price rollercoaster, we were able to close out the week with only a 1% dip, ending the week with a market cap of $69.44 billion. This week’s developments showcase Solana’s exposure to outside market forces. At the same time, they spotlight the blockchain’s continued viability, even as some of its biggest boosters have been forced to take a step back. Solana vs. The Competition: Market Performance and Cross-Chain Dynamics Regarding competition, Solana eclipsed Ethereum ($ETH), which registered a 12% decrease, and kept showing it was ahead in some domains. Solana’s decentralized app (dApp) revenue has stayed robust, with a daily take of $6.73 million. For something that’s often dismissed as being “unsustainable,” given the apparent over-reliance on revenue from so-called “Web3” apps, this is a pretty decent number and suggests that the Solana ecosystem as a whole is doing better than most. And by “most,” I mean even those apps in supposedly more sustainable ecosystems, like Ethereum. Although Solana’s dApp revenue is quite impressive, it still faces fierce competition in terms of fees. TRON continues to lead in daily fees, bringing in $2.09 million, compared to Solana’s $1.49 million. Solana, however, seems to have retaken its crown in the NFT space, with a 27.3% user share. Despite the challenges it may face in some other areas, Solana appears to be a favorite platform for the NFT community, which is growing steadily. Rephrasing in a simple way while keeping the original formatting: Solana is doing particularly well in generating money from decentralized apps. That is especially noteworthy because it shows something we always suspected: Solana can handle real, live applications. We never doubted Solana could support real, live decentralized applications, but now we know it can do so at significant scale and with significant market penetration. (To be fair, the NFT market is also growing, but you don’t have to tell me that.) Moreover, this dApp revenue generation is happening despite the fact that Solana’s dApps currently serve their users with only a fraction of the basic functionality you might expect from, say, the dApps on Ethereum. Solana Ecosystem Performance: Gains and Losses Solana may have presented strength in the market, but not all of its assets shared the same fortune. The performances of many tokens in the Solana ecosystem formed a rather mixed picture. On the one hand, GRASS, a Solana-based token, was one of the biggest gainers, surging 38% over the week. Some other tokens like ATH (+6%) showed positive signs, but overall, the ecosystem looked to be on borrowed time because losses outweighed the gains. The biggest losers in the ecosystem were FTT (-26%), JTO (-16%), and RAY (-16%), which together were doubtless responsible for contributing to the 6% decline in the overall ecosystem market cap to $637 billion. Week in Solana: The Big $SOL Seesaw on the Trump Train. Trump pumps SOL 27%! CME launches futures March 17! MetaMask adds support! GRASS soars 38%! Let's unpack Solana's rollercoaster week 1/6 pic.twitter.com/ApfU7dLhdJ — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) March 5, 2025 Even so, the total value locked (TVL) in Solana’s DeFi ecosystem only decreased modestly by 2%, and managed to outperform both Ethereum and Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s TVL fell by 9% and Bitcoin’s fell by 10%. Solana maintained its spot as a key DeFi player and showed continued relevance, even as the appearance of a downturn kept many in the crypto world guessing. Institutional Moves and Major Developments for Solana The Solana network is seeing increased institutional engagement, and this is seen as a development that opens a new chapter for the network. On March 17, 2025, the CME Group, one of the largest derivatives exchanges, launched Solana futures contracts. This was a big deal and is expected to bring in a new wave of institutional interest to and exposure of the Solana network. And why wouldn’t it? Solana is a top 10 crypto by market cap. Can it get more relevant than that? Another signal of Solana’s expanding adoption was that Trump’s strategic reserve announcement brought a lot of attention to the blockchain. Solana was notably added to the list of cryptocurrencies that make up the U.S. strategic reserve, underscoring its prominence on the global financial stage. Adding Solana to this reserve is being interpreted as a major endorsement that could result in a lot more institutional buy-in. Also, one of the most widely used cryptocurrency wallets, MetaMask, has expressed that it will extend its support to Solana. This sort of accessibility is significant to Solana’s attempt at mainstream crypto adoption, as it effectively removes some of the hurdles that existed for potential users who couldn’t or didn’t want to use Solana’s native wallet. Moreover, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) reported issuing the first Solana-referenced, exchange-traded funds (ETFs)—SOLZ and SOLT—providing institutional investors a fresh avenue to access the burgeoning Solana ecosystem. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Solana? The week has been a whirlwind of activity for Solana, with price changes, ecosystem developments, and fresh institutional interest. If the blockchain had a stock price, it would have gotten a decent haircut on Friday morning, as reports surfaced, mostly in CoinDesk, that the Solana Foundation had laid off a number of its employees. In no way is this a sign of impending doom, given that Solana seems set to remain in the institutionally favored camp. Indeed, the long view with Solana is not just bright but blinding. The launch of Solana futures and the inclusion in the U.S. strategic reserve are meant to attract even more institutional investors, who are seen as a path to mainstream blockchain legitimacy. Solana’s NFT revenue, its dApp revenue, and its fairly recent collection of half a dozen or so ETFs in the institutional toolbox also suggest that Solana is not just going to go away. As Solana changes and keeps pace with the fast-advancing cryptocurrency world, it can almost be taken for granted that it will continue to hold down a pivotal spot in the decentralized finance ecosystem—at least, as new and not-so-new competitors keep flooding the space. Institutional backing and user adoption seen these last few days might elicit the question: Is Solana about to embark on an exciting new chapter? Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

What is REZ, and is it headed towards more potential gains? According to data from CoinGecko, Renzo ( REZ ) rallied to an intraday high of $0.032, over 145% higher than its lowest point this year. The altcoin’s market cap was seated at $63 million, while its daily trading volume more than doubled over the previous day at nearly $281 million. REZ’s gains were accompanied by a surge in demand from derivatives traders. According to CoinGlass data, open interest in its futures market jumped 92% to an all-time high of $42 million. However, weighted funding rates have fallen further into negative territory as most traders seem to bet on a potential short-term price drop. Most of the gains today came after REZ recently secured a listing on Coinbase on the Ethereum (ERC-20 token) network. The altcoin has been rallying since the exchange announced its listing.

REZ price, Aroon and MACD chart — March 7 | Source: crypto.news On the 1-day/USDT price chart, the Aroon Up indicator at 92.86% and Aroon Down at 28.57% confirm strong buying pressure, which signals a dominant uptrend. The MACD and signal lines have moved upward, presenting the potential of a bullish reversal, which could lead to more gains over the upcoming days. Sell-off concerns loom However, the rally could abruptly come to an end due to sell-side pressure. When writing, REZ had lost some of the past day’s gains but was up 41.5%. Some community members are concerned over a potential sell-off by VC Funds and the Renzo team, who currently hold a combined 51.6% of the altcoin’s total supply. Listing on a major crypto exchange such as Coinbase or Binance typically leads to a significant surge in the related asset’s price. However, they tend to face a mean drop following such listings. As crypto.news reported earlier, following its previous listing on Binance, REZ dropped 43% within a day. What is REZ crypto? Founded in 2023, U.S.-based Renzo is a re-staking protocol that lets users stake a variety of crypto assets while offering features like auto-compounding rewards and automated risk management. REZ, which serves as the native and governance token, can be restaked through EigenLayer, allowing holders to secure various Actively Validated Services and earn additional rewards. Besides Coinbase, REZ is available on several major crypto exchanges, including Binance, Gate.io, Kraken, and KuCoin, among others.

At Epoch 743, expected to begin this weekend, Solana validators will vote on Solana Improvement Document-0228, a governance proposal that ties inflation rates to staking participation. SIMD-0228: As we head to the vote in epoch 753, I am proud to share that we have spent almost two months discussing SIMD-0228 in public. (Check screenshot for details). Throughout the process, we incorporated several pieces of community feedback: 1. Transitioned from a… pic.twitter.com/0g138cFGY8 — Vishal Kankani (@kankanivishal) March 6, 2025 The proposal was put forward by Tushar Jain and Vishal Kankani of Multicoin Capital, with support from Max Resnick, lead economist at Anza, a key player in Solana’s development ecosystem. SIMD-0228 aims to replace Solana’s fixed inflation schedule with a market-driven emissions model that adjusts the issuance of new SOL tokens based on the percentage of the total SOL supply that is staked. Currently, Solana follows a fixed inflation structure where the annual issuance rate is 4.6%, decreasing by 15% each year until it stabilizes at 1.5%. Under the new model, inflation would be dynamically adjusted based on staking participation, ensuring the network optimally balances security incentives and token supply. If the percentage of staked SOL falls below 33%, the proposal suggests increasing the inflation rate to encourage more staking, ensuring sufficient network security. On the other hand, if staking participation remains high, the system would lower emissions, preventing unnecessary token dilution. This mechanism is designed to ensure that Solana doesn’t “overpay” for security when there is already strong staking participation, which could help reduce long-term inflationary pressure. You might also like: Solana co-founder says no to government-run crypto reserve The proposal has led to mixed reactions within the community. Proponents like VanEck digital asset research head Matthew Sigel argue that this dynamic model aligns Solana’s monetary policy with its economic activity, potentially making SOL scarcer and more valuable when staking participation is high. “Maintaining a predictable and low inflation rate can support SOL’s value by reducing dilution and sell pressure,” Siegel wrote in a March 4 X post. Estimates suggest that if the proposal is approved, with staking currently around 65%, inflation could drop below 1% annually. Meanwhile, one critic argues that the proposal might be focusing on the wrong metric. In a March 7 X post , MetaDAO co-founder Nallok argued that instead of adjusting inflation based on staking participation, Solana should be looking at dynamic base fees. While he acknowledges that reducing inflation “makes complete sense” if Solana is gearing up for an ETF , MetaDAO co-founder Nallok isn’t convinced that SIMD-0228 is the right approach. He suggested that the proposal’s impact should be cut in half, arguing that the community could “always circle back” if further adjustments were needed. Nallok also warned against relying too much on recent block performance and validator data, calling it “unwise” to make long-term decisions based on short-term trends. Nallok also pointed out that the validator set may shrink over time, either through market forces or deliberate adjustments, and urged the community to consider a broader, more sustainable path rather than locking in a “new status quo” too soon.

On March 6th, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a notable shift in momentum, registering a substantial $134.4 million in net outflows. This sudden exodus raises questions about investor sentiment and the short-term trajectory of these highly anticipated investment vehicles. Let’s dive into the details of this development and understand what it might signify for the future of spot Bitcoin ETFs . What Sparked the Sudden ETF Outflows? According to an X post by Trader T (@thepfund), March 6th marked a day of net outflows for U.S. Bitcoin ETFs . While inflows have generally been the norm since their approval, this reversal is noteworthy. Here’s a breakdown of the outflows across different ETF providers: BlackRock IBIT : Leading the outflows with $50.71 million. Grayscale GBTC : Following closely with $34.51 million in outflows. Franklin Templeton EZBC : Experienced $18.05 million in net outflows. ARK Invest ARKB : Recorded $17.76 million in outflows. VanEck HODL : Saw $8.18 million leaving the ETF. WisdomTree BTCW : Experienced $5.19 million in net outflows. Interestingly, other spot Bitcoin ETF issuers reported no change in their holdings on March 6th. This concentrated outflow from several major players suggests a potentially coordinated or sentiment-driven market movement. Grayscale GBTC’s Continued Outflows: A Drag on the Market? Grayscale GBTC has been a subject of much discussion since the conversion of its Bitcoin Trust into a spot ETF. While the ETF conversion was initially seen as a positive catalyst, GBTC has consistently experienced outflows. This is largely attributed to its higher fee structure compared to newer ETFs and investors taking profits or seeking lower-cost alternatives. The $34.51 million outflow from GBTC on March 6th is part of this ongoing trend and contributes significantly to the overall net outflow figure. The consistent outflows from Grayscale GBTC are a key factor to consider when analyzing the overall health and momentum of spot Bitcoin ETFs. While other ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT have seen significant inflows historically, even IBIT experienced outflows on this particular day, highlighting a broader shift in market dynamics. Are BlackRock IBIT Outflows a Cause for Alarm? BlackRock IBIT , which has been a star performer among the new spot Bitcoin ETFs, also experienced net outflows of $50.71 million on March 6th. This is particularly noteworthy because IBIT has consistently attracted substantial inflows, often offsetting outflows from GBTC and other ETFs. The fact that even IBIT saw outflows raises questions about whether this is a temporary blip or the start of a more sustained trend. While a single day’s outflow doesn’t necessarily indicate a long-term shift, it’s crucial to monitor whether this becomes a recurring pattern for BlackRock IBIT and other leading ETFs. Sustained outflows could indicate waning institutional interest or profit-taking after the initial surge of enthusiasm following ETF approvals. Spot Bitcoin ETF Performance: Beyond a Single Day It’s important to contextualize this single day of ETF outflows within the broader performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Since their launch in January 2024, these ETFs have collectively accumulated billions of dollars in assets under management (AUM). They have provided a regulated and accessible pathway for institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Here’s a quick recap of the benefits spot Bitcoin ETFs offer: Accessibility : Democratize Bitcoin investment by allowing access through traditional brokerage accounts. Regulation : Operate within established regulatory frameworks, providing investor protection. Liquidity : Offer high liquidity, enabling easy buying and selling of Bitcoin exposure. Tax Efficiency (Potentially) : Can offer tax advantages compared to holding Bitcoin directly (depending on jurisdiction and individual circumstances). Institutional Adoption : Facilitate institutional investment in Bitcoin, potentially driving broader market growth. Despite the positive long-term outlook and the inherent advantages, ETF outflows like those seen on March 6th serve as a reminder that the crypto market remains susceptible to fluctuations in sentiment and broader macroeconomic factors. What Actionable Insights Can Investors Glean? For investors, the $134.4 million ETF outflows on March 6th provide several key insights: Market Sentiment is Dynamic : Even in a bull market, sentiment can shift quickly. Monitoring ETF flows can provide clues about investor positioning. GBTC Outflows Continue to Influence : The ongoing outflows from GBTC remain a significant factor in overall ETF flow dynamics. IBIT Flows are Key Indicator : Watch for trends in IBIT flows as a barometer of institutional interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs. Long-Term Perspective is Crucial : A single day’s outflow should not overshadow the long-term potential and overall positive trend of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Diversification Remains Important : Even with ETFs, diversification across asset classes and within crypto investments is crucial to manage risk. Conclusion: Navigating the Evolving Bitcoin ETF Landscape The net outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on March 6th serve as a timely reminder of the crypto market’s inherent volatility and the dynamic nature of investor sentiment. While the long-term outlook for Bitcoin ETFs remains positive, driven by increased accessibility and institutional adoption, short-term fluctuations and ETF outflows are to be expected. Investors should closely monitor these trends, stay informed, and maintain a balanced perspective when navigating the evolving landscape of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investments.

41270768,https://nulltx.com/?p=146697,1741332659,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,The Decline of Pump.fun: Solana’s Memecoin Scene Faces Major Fatigue,https://nulltx.com/the-decline-of-pump-fun-solanas-memecoin-scene-faces-major-fatigue/,"Solana’s once-thriving memecoin sector—one that saw explosive growth during the past year—has taken a sharp downturn in trading activity, with recent reports even highlighting a dramatic fall in trading volume. Pump.fun, a platform that has been a major hub for Solana’s memecoin ecosystem, has seen trading volume absolutely tank by 94%. From a high of $3 billion in January 2025, trading volume on the platform has collapsed to just $146 million—an indication that the memecoin hype on Solana is beginning to lose its steam. Once seen as a cornerstone of Solana’s ecosystem, the memecoin sector is now in decline. Its community is reeling from some substantial hits to interest and trust and is showing a little energy at the moment. This watershed moment is being driven by several factors: a series of rug pulls, meme piracy, and essentially, a downturn in the fundamental concept of a memecoin. You know the speculative frenzy we keep referencing? It seems to be edging away in both seen and unseen ways. Trust Erodes Amid Rug Pulls and Shady Promotions There are a few key reasons for the swift downturn in the popularity of Solana-based memecoins. One of the most significant of these is the increasing number of rug pulls and shady projects that have infiltrated the memecoin universe. And these have some pretty disastrous effects on the space. Not only is the Solana ecosystem having to contend with a serious deficit in developer trust (a risk that all ecosystems face when developers pull the rug on users), but the memecoin itself now is also viewed as a much riskier investment than before. In the Solana memecoin scene, rug pulls, during which developers leave a project after draining liquidity from the market, have been a familiar occurrence. As these scams have spread, investor confidence has started to dwindle, and many users have begun to question the validity of new memecoins that enter the market. This loss of trust has had a direct impact on the volume of new tokens that are being listed on decentralized exchanges, like Raydium, a popular platform for Solana-based assets. Now, fewer tokens are being listed, and the once-active scene of trading Solana memecoins has started to stagnate. Trust has also been eroded by shady promotions. The aggressive marketing campaigns that promote memecoins come with promises boosted by too-good-to-be-true claims. In many instances, these promotions are backed by no-accountability influencers or anonymous teams, which has fueled skepticism among potential investors. Of course, this isn’t to say that memecoins are now completely off-limits. Some traders and enthusiasts still feel comfortable diving into a new memecoin or investing in an existing one. But anyone embarking on such an adventure these days realizes that the risks are often just not worth it. The Fall of Memecoins and the Shift in Solana’s Ecosystem The Solana ecosystem is facing the same downturn that has recently befallen the memecoin market. After a period of insane growth and interest, Solana’s memecoin scene appears to be slowing down. The Solana memecoin market has pulled back like any good market should after an insane surge. The hype that drove the Solana memecoin market to new heights has subsided, and now we are experiencing the hangover from the surge. At its peak, the memecoin market was a thrilling and extremely speculative corner of Solana’s blockchain, drawing in both sharp traders and wet-behind-the-ears novices eager to ride the latest trend. Memecoins, often created as jests or for the sake of experimentation, built themselves a wild following, especially in the halcyon days of early 2025. Yet, the real worth of many such projects became of ever-growing concern. How could we take seriously a coin that didn’t claim to be anything more than a laughing stock? We couldn’t, and that’s why we raised the alarm. https://t.co/PJIijlPble ’s trading volume has collapsed—down 94% from $3B in January to just $146M. The memecoin hype isn’t hitting like before. Fewer tokens are making it to Raydium, and after all the rug pulls and shady promos, trust is wearing thin. $SOL’s once-explosive… pic.twitter.com/VhIUnXkjqb — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) March 5, 2025 The memecoin downturn has had a ripple effect across the Solana ecosystem. With the Solana development community experiencing a serious slowdown, Solana is now trying to use this moment to refocus on diversifying its use cases and attracting projects that are more sustainable and have a longer-term vision. To some observers, this is both ironic and fitting. It is fitting because Solana is known for being a fast, cheap, and dev-friendly blockchain and (in)famous for being a home for meme-spawning projects. Even with all these setbacks, Solana is still a top blockchain network. It is working on quite a few substantial developments and significant innovations in other areas, like decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and gaming. It is worth holding up, though, that the collapse of the memecoin scene, for whatever it is worth, has underscored the very real volatility of the crypto market and the risk that speculative assets can and do pose to a blockchain’s good name. What’s Next for Solana and Memecoins? Though the fall of Pump.fun and the wider decline of Solana’s memecoin market may signal an era’s end for this particular Solana sector, it is unlikely to be the end of Solana itself. The blockchain has a lot more going on. Serious projects with a real utility continue to use it. And even within the memecoin market, some believe that what is going on with Pump.fun and the other recent declines is just a prelude to the blockchain’s next To restore Solana’s memecoin scene, trust and credibility must be rebuilt in the community. This can be done via some combination of the following: – More transparent projects. – Greater regulation of memecoin promotions. – A get-rich-quick mentality that has fueled much of the hype. Moreover, the developers might consider creating memecoins that do offer something more than speculative trading opportunities. Solana needs to keep diversifying its services and building a sturdy ecosystem that delivers lasting value if it’s going to hold on to its place as one of crypto’s top-tier blockchain networks. Otherwise, its path looks rather similar to that of other once-prominent blockchains. In the meantime, memecoins show just how risky and volatile the crypto business remains. To conclude, the growth of Solana’s memecoin market, which we saw with Pump.fun, has definitely slowed down. But Solana’s not going anywhere. And neither are any of us who are in the ecosystem. So us—Solana and all of us in the ecosystem—are looking to the next phase of evolution, which should be more sustainable and won’t be driven by tokens that are ‘meme-based.’ It should be driven by actual utility. Let’s hope that should name next phase the ‘next evolution phase’. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Not only does the space now hold over 1 billion SEI tokens, but this trading pair has also garnered enough interest to pay attention once more to the SEI blockchain specifically. That’s a pretty obvious setup for the current narrative surrounding SEI and the way it has seemingly bounced back from its previous period of crypto winter. What’s perhaps far more relevant in the current conversation is how TVL can often signal the next big payment for a blockchain’s native token. $SEI has just smashed past its previous all-time high in TVL, now holding over 1 billion #SEI . That’s some serious momentum for an L1 like this. What’s brewing over there? Something big or just another hype cycle? pic.twitter.com/myBsPDBqBW — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) March 5, 2025 The SEI token is currently in the “smart money buy zone.” Trading volume has surged, and there has been a noticeable increase in institutional interest. This rise in activity, coupled with a classic cup-bottom chart formation, suggests that SEI may be entering a new phase of growth. SEI’s Explosive Growth and Institutional Backing In the last few months, the $SEI token has experienced impressive growth to a level that is pretty much gaining serious interest in the DeFi space. Its TVL has recently crossed the $1 billion level, showing promise of serious traction for this relatively new platform. This makes it currently the third-ranked blockchain in TVL behind the established top two layer 1 (L1) blockchains, Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. This remarkable surge in TVL displays the trust that investors place in SEI’s long-lasting viability. There is ever more liquidity entering the ecosystem, and with it, the platform’s infrastructure keeps growing and getting more resilient, which is an open invitation to the dApps and services to use this infrastructure and do even better than before. SEI’s growth coincides with the many blockchain projects that are still reeling from the volatility of 2024. In this stormy environment, SEI has captured a fair amount of attention. Why? Because the layers it offers are scalable, secure, and fast—the trifecta, in effect. By using SEI, developers can build decentralized apps in an ecosystem that has all the growth and innovation vibes of an app store. Major Investment from Trump-backed World Liberty Financial Besides organic growth, SEI is pulling in real institutional interest. A couple of months ago, World Liberty Financial—an investment firm co-founded by former President Donald Trump—made a serious play in the SEI market. According to figures from Arkham, World Liberty Financial picked up 547,990 $SEI tokens worth about 125,000 USDC. That’s not chump change, and it’s yet another sign that serious players are coming into the SEI ecosystem. If nothing else, World Liberty Financial’s move is a very solid “vote of confidence” for the SEI platform. World Liberty Financial’s acquisition is yet another signal to the market that institutions are adopting blockchain technology. $SEI is sitting in the smart money buy zone with volume surging. Classic cup-bottom formation TVL just smashed ATH, crossing $1B+ $SEI first in Stables —massive momentum for an L1! Swing trade Recently Trump-backed World Liberty Financial bought 547,990 $SEI with… pic.twitter.com/fCP4W0cRo2 — Bitcoin Buddha (@Bitcoin_Buddah) March 6, 2025 In particular, Layer-1 networks like SEI are gaining traction with institutions. For decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain companies, World Liberty Financial’s decision to acquire more than just tokens and, instead, also gain equity in SEI is an important seal of approval for the underlying technology. It suggests that the company that handles several billion dollars in financial transactions is betting on the success of Layer-1 networks, DeFi, and the blockchain revolution. That could have real implications for the bottom line. SEI in the Smart Money Buy Zone: A Technical Analysis In terms of tech, the $SEI token is now in what appears to be the “smart money buy zone.” This is a fancy term for when an asset’s price seems to be low compared with how much it should be growing. That’s when you find big, institutional investors and seasoned retail investors buying up an asset. And why not? The recent volume surge combined with the appearance of a certain chart pattern has some folks thinking that $SEI could be on the verge of breaking out. If that happens, and you’re holding some, you’ll definitely be capitalizing on the future growth of the asset. Presently, the chart discloses a “cup-bottom” formation, a pattern frequently observed in the price charts of assets that implies a reversal from a downtrend to an uptrend. By and large, a cup-bottom formation indicates that an asset is fully primed to reclaim lost territory and begin an upswing. If this pattern continues to hold, $SEI could be reaching a breakout moment, making it an ideal buy candidate for anyone looking to get in now before the next big rally. Increasing adoption of the SEI blockchain is anticipated by many investors and analysts who are closely following its developments. The SEI blockchain is expected to see continuing adoption growth, as is predicted for decentralized finance applications and the kinds of developments that make use of smart contracts. SEI’s Future Prospects: A Layer-1 Blockchain to Watch The recent accomplishments, along with support from institutions such as World Liberty Financial, make it seem like the future for SEI is as clear as the…well, future. Layer 1 blockchains are already vying for attention and investors, but many (including the ones listed above) promise potential. Their various abilities to address the shortcomings of previous generations of blockchain technologies put a spotlight on SEI and its mechanism for achieving consensus. SEI’s TVL more than doubled to $397 million over the last month, with institutional investments from a range of large entities. Overall, the projects and platforms within SEI have received major votes of confidence. Investors should be paying close attention to SEI as it continues to be one of the most talked-about Layer-1 platforms among blockchain projects. The “smart money” flow says it all. Investors and developers should consider the rapid movement of SEI as toward becoming a dominant player in the blockchain space. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Just in the past 24 hours, two high-profile individuals have made some serious buys of the token, which now seems like a pretty confident bet on the future of the Morpho protocol. Significantly, there are two prominent buyers of $MORPHO that have been observed adding to their positions recently: an address known as 0x58d9 (a.k.a. the whale investor @izebel_eth on Twitter) and an address known as 0x17bb (a.k.a. the Smart Dex Trader @yondercode). Both have made what appear to be rather substantial purchases: 200,000 $MORPHO tokens worth about $343.1K (by 0x58d9) and 38,200 $MORPHO tokens worth around $65.6K (by 0x17bb). These acquisitions are making waves, and for good reason. They point to potentially increasing optimism among both individual and institutional actors that the $MORPHO token and its associated platform is a sound investment. Growing Confidence in Morpho Protocol The lending and borrowing of crypto assets in a decentralized and overcollateralized way has been gaining traction in the space of DeFi, thanks to a protocol called Morpho. Recent buying activity appears to indicate that investors see a strong future for the protocol. Morpho affords users a streamlined and secure means of accessing the rapidly expanding market of cryptocurrency lending and borrowing. Morpho’s decentralized asset-lending protocol is attracting the attention of both whales and sophisticated traders, thanks to its unique model. Morphé is based on the rapid growth of decentralized finance (DeFi), which attracts the attention of most traders. DeFi offers advantages over centralized finance (CeFi), including flexibility, transparency, and security. Yet most DeFi lending services operate similarly to those in the centralized world; they pay interest to lenders but charge interest to borrowers. Morphó has a more sophisticated model, which enables it to divide the earnings of this lending service between those two. Thus, both lend-ers and borrowers use it. Whale and Smart Dex Trader Purchases Signal Confidence Morpho’s increasing appeal is underscored further by the recent large acquisitions of $MORPHO tokens by both the whale and the SDT. Notably, 200,000 $MORPHO tokens were just hoisted up by our watery friend. (Unfortunately, we don’t have a visual of this either.) This massive purchase of nearly half a million dollars’ worth of tokens signals some serious confidence in Morpho’s long-term value from a whale that could’ve just as easily gobbled up some other trendy DeFi token. $MORPHO is now accumulated by both a whale and a Smart Dex Trader over the past 24 hours – Whale 0x58d9 aka @izebel_eth bought 200K MORPHO ($343.1K ) – SDT 0x17bb aka @yondercode bought 38.2K MORPHO ($65.6K) @MorphoLabs is showing positive signals. Wallet Address below pic.twitter.com/viWIOQf9Zf — iCrypto | Sentiment & On-chain Analysis (@iCryptoAI) March 6, 2025 When you go big in the DeFi space, you make waves. And that’s why the 200,000 tokens just picked up by the Morpho whale matter. Besides the whale’s purchase, the acquisition of 38,200 $MORPHO tokens by the SDT indicates that more seasoned, small-scale traders are starting to pay attention to the protocol. These SDTs are often highly active and trade in a very sophisticated manner across various decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to front-run and capitalize on market movements. Their recent foray into the $MORPHO token market suggests that they believe the $MORPHO token is a good bet and a potential market mover in the near future. A growing consensus is emerging among both large investors and experienced traders. They now consider Morpho a good investment, one that is likely to provide substantial value in the DeFi ecosystem. Their accumulation of $MORPHO tokens is a sure sign that the protocol has the kind of street cred that only a few projects in this space seem to have. And that’s in addition to the recognition of Morpho’s potential to totally disrupt the lending and borrowing market. Morpho Labs Showing Positive Signals The folks at Morpho, Morpho Labs, are making substantial progress in constructing a solid and scalable decentralized lending protocol. The favorable sentiment surrounding $MORPHO is also indicative of the platform’s ongoing development and the escalating interest it’s receiving from the broader DeFi community. Morpho Labs has been burning the midnight oil to enhance the protocol’s features and user experience, to shore up its security, and to ensure that it remains well-positioned in the DeFi space as that sector itself evolves. Additionally, the recent increased interest in $MORPHO could be ascribed to the overall growth in the DeFi sector. With decentralized finance taking off and attracting both retail and institutional investors, protocols like Morpho are set to benefit from this development. Offering a novel overcollateralized lending model, which seems to appeal to both serious investors and retail traders, Morpho Labs is trying to establish a place for itself in the DeFi ecosystem. Future Outlook for $MORPHO and Morpho Protocol Key Takeaways: – Decentralized finance, or DeFi, is part of the ongoing evolution of crypto markets. – Morph Finance is an emerging player in the DeFi space. – Morph’s core innovation is a mesh network of liquidity pools that lets users access DeFi capital without relying on conventional financial institutions. – Among its competitors, Morph is in a leadership path. The pace of lending and borrowing in morph pools is several orders of magnitude greater than that in competing DEXes like Aave, Compound, and Fulcrum. Increasing support from investors, including big fish and Smart Dex Traders, gives us a positive take on $MORPHO. The platform keeps refining its product. Its user base keeps expanding. Is demand for the token going to go up? We think so. To sum up, the recent accumulation of $MORPHO by a whale and a Smart Dex Trader emphasizes the rising trust in the Morpho protocol. The overcollateralized lending model, coupled with unyielding support from the DeFi community, makes Morpho a top contender in the decentralized finance space. With patient, hands-on developers and a growing cadre of investors, Morpho is primed to continue its path of most resistance—upward and through the disruptive econ gulf between crypto lending/borrowing and us.

In November 2023, U.S. Customs and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) seized Bitcoin mining equipment, arguing that the chips contained restricted technology from the Chinese chip company Sophgo. At the time, U.S. Customs and the FCC said that the chips may have contained radio interference, but this seemed like an excuse for targeting Chinese technology. Ethan Vera, COO of Luxor Technology, said that although some equipment has been released, many remain detained. Sophgo, a Chinese company, owns most of the machines. The U.S. claims that Sophgo was secretly working with Huawei, and that this warranted a seizure because the latter is a blacklisted company. American authorities claim that this supposed link justified the seizure because it was hard for them to clear the equipment. Sophgo has denied having a business relationship with Huawei. One company has said that it is now being charged a holding fee for the seizure of its machines. It owns 200 ASICs and now has a bill worth $200,000. In total, around 10,000 mining machines were seized at various U.S. ports. Some retailers claim that their equipment was valued at $5 million. However, some Chinese ASICs were not seized by officials and continued to make their way to American retailers. These seizures present a problem for Trump’s plan to make America the crypto capital of the world. The disruption of mining equipment could limit the Bitcoin hashrate and impede the market growth of cryptocurrencies. President Trump has pushed hard to support Bitcoin mining in America. He has even stated that he wants the remaining Bitcoin mined in America. The U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security is responsible for setting a strategy against Chinese mining requirements. They have created a set of rules for dealing with advanced semiconductors, focusing on crypto and AI and preventing Chinese progress. The problem, however, is that China supplies around 98% of all chips used in crypto mining. The largest manufacturer, Bitmain, has expanded operations in the U.S., focusing mainly on increased delivery speeds. Bitmain has made a public statement, saying that it is confident in its progress and that it will benefit industry partners in America. Despite a large percentage of chips produced in China, around 38% of Bitcoin’s hashrate is based in America. Therefore, crypto’s success seems to be based on Chinese American collaboration. However, the U.S. and China are locked in a trade war, with America focusing on competing for AI and military dominance. America has an advantage with chip design. China has a manufacturing advantage and is making much progress in research and development. Huawei, a leading company in AI, has been blacklisted by America, limiting the amount of companies it can source from. This is not a new problem because the U.S. has blocked Huawei for a long time. This is why Huawei has an extensive Research and Development programme, because they have to make their products from scratch. However, this has only benefited Huawei because it now has cutting-edge technology and an experienced team of innovators.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,MINING|BTC|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-07 07:36:31
41271022,https://nulltx.com/?p=146694,1741333130,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Bitcoin Rebounds Above $90K Amidst Growing Wallets and Profit-Taking Activity,https://nulltx.com/bitcoin-rebounds-above-90k-amidst-growing-wallets-and-profit-taking-activity/,"March saw the price of Bitcoin bounce back sharply above $90,000 after a period of wild fluctuations. Even though the crypto market has been a tad volatile of late, the preeminent cryptocurrency has kept showing its resilience—a quality that always seems to give rise to hopes for yet more upward price momentum. One trend accompanying the price surge, and sure to be of interest to retail investors, has been the apparent increase in the number of Bitcoin wallets. Yet, this uptick in retail investor activity could just be the cover for larger players taking some much-deserved profits. Wallet Growth Continues as Retail Investors Enter the Market During the last month, the Bitcoin network has seen meaningful expansion, with 50,000 new wallets to show for it. The really interesting part? Almost all of these new wallets belong to smaller Bitcoin holders, which means that our engagement with the cryptocurrency continues apace. The retail sector, in particular, can be said to be showing some enthusiasm for this digital currency, with many of us building our positions. Just how many of us? Well, the number of wallets holding less than 0.1 BTC has swelled by about 37,390. Bitcoin has rebounded back above $90K as prices have been rollercoastering here in March. There are 50K more wallets on the network than there were a month ago. By size, there are: 37,390 MORE wallets holding less than 0.1 $BTC 12,754 MORE wallets holding 0.1 – 100 $BTC … pic.twitter.com/xClRIGa4Rj — Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 5, 2025 At the same time, Bitcoin’s accounts have been on the rise. Yet, it is critical to specify which types of accounts have been growing fast and which have not. For instance, wallets with at least 100 BTC in them have not been growing at all. In fact, in the last couple of weeks, six fewer wallets have been counted as having 100 or more BTC. In contrast, wallets with 0.1 to 100 BTC in them have grown by a whopping 12,754. And it’s a very safe bet that this is a sign, not of profit-taking, but of accumulation. The relatively slow growth of large wallets could signal that caution prevails among big investors. They may be trying to lock in profits as they watch Bitcoin’s rollercoaster of a price chart. Still, one has to wonder whether there might be some renewed bullishness in the market if the number of these larger wallets is also on the rise. After all, the price breakout and the breakout in the number of large wallets could be seen as a positively correlated event. Profit-Taking from Large Wallets Signals Caution Even as the number of small and mid-sized Bitcoin wallets has grown—an indicator of increased grassroots engagement with the digital currency—worries about the behavior of bigger wallets have mounted. Ample data exists to indicate that, since the establishment of a new bear market in early 2018, the ranks of small and medium-sized wallets have continued to balloon. Despite the rally and recovery seen in the overall Bitcoin market since the beginning of this year, the number of wallets containing 100 or more BTC has only seen a slight uptick. This suggests that the big guys are either not engaging much with BTC at current levels or are locking in profits post-surge. Profit-taking by major holders of Bitcoin might look like a natural, even healthy, development. Bitcoin has been exceedingly volatile in recent weeks, and the larger your Bitcoin wallet, the more sensitive you are to these kinds of market swings. We haven’t seen this kind of extreme in either direction for a long time. And when the price of an asset has been anything but stable, the urge to take profits when you can hardly gainsays human nature. If markets calm somewhat and these large wallets can muster the nerve to add to their holdings instead of trimming them, that will be a sign that the buoys are out again and a more stable Bitcoin price could be in our future. Regardless of these profit-taking steps, the entire market is still perking up. Overall, things seem to be going in a good direction. At least they’re going better than they were going, which was in a downward direction. Bitcoin is right up there leading the pack in terms of price points to pay attention to, right along with the usual suspects that always seem to come up (like Amazon, Google, etc.) when talking about investments. Most eyes, meanwhile, are watching to see if the cryptocurrency can reclaim the $97,000 price point. If #Bitcoin $BTC reclaims $97,000, it could gain momentum for a move toward $150,000, according to the Pi Cycle Top indicator! pic.twitter.com/yok308t4Jy — Ali (@ali_charts) March 6, 2025 Bitcoin ETF Outflows and Market Sentiment Besides the activity seen in Bitcoin wallets, the total amount of funds in institutional investments seems to be on the move as well. On March 5, the total net outflow from Bitcoin spot ETFs was recorded at 38.2958 million US dollars. This figure could be a reflection of the recent price volatility having a more direct influence on investor sentiment. Due to the direct affinity spot ETFs have with the price of Bitcoin, not to mention the more indirect link they have with the price of the cryptocurrency’s underlying asset, these recent moves (or lack thereof) could speak volumes about the kinds of concerns and opportunities Bitcoin is currently presenting to potential investors. On March 5, the total net outflow of Bitcoin spot ETF was 38.2958 million US dollars, and the total net outflow of Ethereum spot ETF was 63.3202 million US dollars. https://t.co/59u0BnEqLG — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 6, 2025 The outflow might signal that institutional investors are growing warier, perhaps forecasting that prices will correct or consolidate in the near term. But the overall narrative in the Bitcoin market seems as bullish as ever, with the cryptocurrency’s many long-term proponents remaining quite optimistic. The Road Ahead for Bitcoin While Bitcoin persists in its attempts to break through crucial price levels, the next few weeks might be very important for its market cycle to determine which way the price goes. If less wealthy Bitcoin holders continue to accumulate the price-stressed asset, and if the well-to-do on the blockchain start to add to their positions once more, we could see the price of Bitcoin committing to the kind of uptrend that gets a lot of people talking about it again. Though the wallet count is rising and large investors are giving mixed signals, the number of wallets is a generally positive sign. The big investors’ profit-taking could put a damper on Bitcoin’s growth but their returning to the market could see it blasting off toward $150,000. The state of the market is cautious optimism.

If it is profitable for us, let’s do it. We have excess electricity. Let them make this cryptocurrency and so on”. Belarus has an excess energy supply resulting from the upgrade of the nuclear power plant with a second power unit in May 2023. The country is also considering a second nuclear power plant. Shortly after Lukashenko formed his new government, he started investigating ways to mine cryptocurrency from excess energy. One priority of his new government is to optimise the country’s 5,700-kilometre grid. “The most important thing”, said Lukashenko, “is to upgrade the power grid infrastructure taking into account the growing demand for electricity from households and the economy”. Belarus could imitate the Kingdom of Bhutan, which has excess hydropower energy. The country has dedicated 100 megawatts to Bitcoin mining and is considering another 500 megawatts to boost its mining capabilities. The government currently holds a Bitcoin reserve of around $1 billion. Viktor Karankevich, the previous energy minister, announced in December 2023, that cryptocurrency mining was popular in the country, with Chinese and Russian mining businesses bursting with popularity, and the Belarus power grid was robust enough to handle the increase in demand. Lukashenko mentioned recent developments in America regarding attitudes toward crypto, especially President Trump’s new crypto reserve and plans to boost the mining business in America. “Moreover, you see the path the world is going, especially the largest economy in the world. They announced yesterday that they will keep in reserve,” said Lukashenko. “Therefore, there will be demand for them. Well, maybe we should do it ourselves. Well, we attract some investors, sell them electricity, although I do not rule it out. But we need to do it ourselves. There are such proposals. I think that you will step over this bureaucracy and report what needs to be done.” Daniel Batton, environmental researcher, claims that Bitcoin mining makes the energy sector more sustainable. After reviewing scientific literature on the topic, he concludes that Bitcoin mining opens up opportunities that increase the likelihood of using green energy methods and reducing the carbon footprint of energy companies, a likely result when Bitcoin mining uses excess energy on the grid. The war in Ukraine, however, has halted foreign investment in Belarus’ cryptocurrency mining. Lukashenko has been an ally of Russia’s Vladimir Putin and has suffered from sanctions imposed by Western countries against Russia and Belarus. The first nuclear plant in Belarus started running in June 2021, providing an abundance of energy that could be used for crypto mining. The reactor has a 1,100 megawatt capacity. A second reactor would therefore add another 1,100 megawatts to the grid. Russia finances both reactors.",Bitcoin|News|belarus|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|REGULATION|FIAT|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-07 07:39:17

41271100,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137907,1741333224,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Concerning $36M Ethereum ETF Outflows: Decoding the Investor Sentiment Shift,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-etf-outflows-investor-sentiment/,"The cryptocurrency market is ever-evolving, and recent data regarding U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs has sparked considerable discussion. On March 6th, these investment vehicles experienced a notable shift as they collectively recorded significant net outflows. Let’s delve into the details of these Ethereum ETF outflows and what they might indicate about the current market sentiment. Decoding the $36.32M Spot Ethereum ETF Net Outflows According to insights shared by Trader T (@thepfund) on X, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net outflow of $36.32 million on March 6th. This figure represents the combined effect of investor activity across various crypto ETF offerings in the United States. While the crypto market often sees fluctuations, such a consolidated outflow day warrants a closer examination. What exactly happened, and which ETFs were most affected? Here’s a breakdown of the ETFs that experienced outflows: Fidelity’s FETH: Led the pack with a substantial net outflow of $25.88 million. BlackRock’s ETHA: Followed with a net outflow of $10.44 million. Interestingly, the remaining spot Ethereum ETF products in the U.S. market reported neither significant inflows nor outflows on the same day. This concentration of outflows in Fidelity’s and BlackRock’s ETFs raises questions about specific factors influencing investor decisions regarding these particular funds. Why the Exodus? Potential Factors Behind ETF Net Outflows Understanding why investors might pull out funds from Ethereum investment products is crucial. Several factors could be at play: Profit Taking: After periods of potential gains in Ethereum’s price, some investors might choose to secure profits by withdrawing their ETF holdings. This is a common practice in volatile markets like cryptocurrency. Market Volatility and Uncertainty: The crypto market is known for its volatility. Increased uncertainty, perhaps due to regulatory news or broader economic factors, can lead investors to reduce their exposure to riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, triggering ETF net outflows . Shifting Investment Strategies: Institutional and retail investors constantly reassess their portfolios. Outflows from Ethereum ETFs could be part of a broader shift in investment strategy, possibly towards other asset classes or different crypto investments. Specific ETF Performance Concerns: While less likely given the broad market movement, it’s possible that investors had concerns specific to the performance or management of FETH and ETHA, leading to the concentrated outflows from these funds. Broader Market Correction: Outflows could be symptomatic of a wider correction in the crypto market, where investors are de-risking across various crypto assets, not just Ethereum. Spot Ethereum ETF Landscape: A Quick Recap Spot Ethereum ETFs represent a significant step in the accessibility of cryptocurrency investments. They allow investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the digital asset. Key benefits of these ETFs include: Accessibility and Convenience: ETFs are easily accessible through traditional brokerage accounts, simplifying Ethereum investment for a wider audience. Regulation and Security: Operating within regulated frameworks, ETFs offer a layer of security and compliance that direct crypto ownership might lack. Diversification: ETFs can be a tool for portfolio diversification, allowing investors to allocate a portion of their assets to crypto without managing wallets or private keys. However, challenges and considerations remain: Management Fees: ETFs come with management fees, which can impact overall returns compared to direct crypto holding. Tracking Error: While designed to track the price of Ethereum, ETFs might experience slight deviations, known as tracking error. Market Volatility Impact: Despite the ETF structure, the underlying asset (Ethereum) remains volatile, and ETF performance will be directly influenced by these market swings. Actionable Insights: Navigating Ethereum ETF Investments For investors monitoring Ethereum ETF outflows and considering their next steps, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on market trends, ETF flow data, and broader crypto news. Platforms like Coinglass provide valuable ETF flow information. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different asset classes and within the crypto space can mitigate risk. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrency investments are inherently risky. Ensure your investment decisions align with your personal risk tolerance and financial goals. Consider Long-Term Perspective: Short-term ETF net outflows might be noise in the larger picture. Focus on the long-term potential and fundamentals of Ethereum and the broader crypto market if you believe in its future. Due Diligence on ETFs: Before investing, thoroughly research different crypto ETF options, considering factors like expense ratios, tracking history, and fund management. Conclusion: Interpreting Ethereum ETF Signals The $36.32 million net outflow from U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on March 6th is a noteworthy event. While it’s essential to avoid knee-jerk reactions to a single day’s data, these figures serve as a reminder of the dynamic nature of the crypto market and investor sentiment. By staying informed, understanding market dynamics, and maintaining a balanced perspective, investors can navigate the exciting yet volatile world of Ethereum investment and crypto ETFs effectively. The key takeaway is to view such events as data points in a larger narrative, informing a well-rounded and strategic approach to crypto investing.

In terms of on-chain activity, there’s nothing really negative to point to. There are some positive developments, in fact, that some analysts are excited about. I mean, take a look at this screenshot I got earlier today, showing the Ethereum network’s number of unique addresses. You can see the number has gone parabolic lately. And if you look at that ‘over 10,000 ETH’ line, in particular, those figures are really something to behold. Ethereum’s Strong Whale Activity Amid Waning Sentiment Ethereum addresses that hold more than 10,000 ETH have achieved a new milestone, totaling 919. The recent growth in these kinds of addresses suggests that not just individuals but also institutions see Ethereum as a worthy investment. That said, even with these significant investments, Ethereum’s price has continued to languish. Institutional and individual whales, holding these amounts of ETH, are often viewed as long-term holders. They don’t appear to be panicking; instead, they seem likely to hold and maybe even accumulate in the event of further market downturns. The number of addresses holding more than 10,000 #Ethereum $ETH has reached 919! pic.twitter.com/Mis2B3chkz — Ali (@ali_charts) March 6, 2025 Even though substantial activity in large wallets could be viewed as a clear bullish signal for Ethereum’s price in the short term, the prevailing sentiment surrounding the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is anything but bullish. If anything, the crypto community’s sentiment has plunged into the depths of despair. On what seems like an almost daily basis now, bears are congregating across various media platforms to voice just how long and painful the Ethereum price decline might get. And frankly, the Ethereum price has been underperforming when compared to other major assets likes Bitcoin, which has seen recent significant price rebounds. Yet, this overwhelming pessimism may not be such a bad thing after all. Many seasoned cryptocurrency investors argue that times of pronounced negativity often offer a contrarian indicator. When social media and investor sentiment turn especially sour, it has historically marked the moment when an asset not only stops going down but also reverses and starts back up. For those able to withstand the market storm battering us now, there may be an opportunity to accumulate Ethereum at a lower price than we’ve seen in a while. Ethereum sentiment has declined to year-low levels as the asset has underperformed relative to other top caps. For those patiently holding their $ETH , the bearishness being projected across social media is a good sign of a potential turnaround once crypto markets stabilize. pic.twitter.com/iRaKTvb0Tu — Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 6, 2025 Ethereum ETF Outflows Reflect Market Caution Ethereum has recently seen not only shifts in sentiment but also some activity that is not so favorable for it. On March 5, Ethereum’s spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) bled a net $63.32 million. This appears to be a pretty strong figure in terms of projecting a less-than-stellar sentiment. It seems to be suggesting that some institutional players whose money is managed in these vehicles are reducing their exposure to Ethereum. On March 5, the total net outflow of Bitcoin spot ETF was 38.2958 million US dollars, and the total net outflow of Ethereum spot ETF was 63.3202 million US dollars. https://t.co/59u0BnEqLG — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 6, 2025 Several factors could explain the outflow, including the underperformance of Ethereum and the bearish sentiment affecting the market. Institutional investors often use spot ETFs as a vehicle to gain exposure to an asset without making a direct investment. They prefer these funds because they are as liquid and as regulated as the cash and cash-equivalent investments that institutional investors usually hold. Outflowing funds likely indicate that investors are either reducing their exposure to risky assets or reallocating their portfolios to other investments that seem more attractive. This recent ETF outflow for Ethereum represents, in the short term at least, a loss of investor confidence. But ETF flows can be super volatile, and a big chunk of this outflow could just be the reaction of a few investors to some pretty wild market moves. If Ethereum can capture some upward momentum (and it has outperformed Bitcoin of late), there is a solid chance that it will be back in the institutional interest game. Looking Ahead: Patience Could Pay Off for Ethereum Holders Even though optimism has recently taken a hit, with ETFs pulling out of Ethereum, there are still reasons to be hopeful about ETH’s future. For one, big wallets packed with plenty of Ethereum show that some key players are confident in the asset. Also, the way Ethereum is currently being talked about on social media and in investor circles suggests that it’s not far from hitting a bottom—an inflection point where long-term holders might want to do some buying. The development of Ethereum is proceeding well; the way is being paved for the kinds of decentralized applications (dApps) that people might actually use. That scenario is beginning to play out on the platform. Anyway, DeFi seems here to stay, and all those dApps using DeFi components are still part of the Ethereum “internet of things” scenario. My principal investment vehicle for expressing a long-term, bullish view on Ethereum is the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which I will discuss below. Individuals who currently possess Ethereum and have seen its price drop are likely not feeling good about their situation. But if these individuals are long on Ether and believe in its fundamental value, this could be an ideal time to purchase more Ether, as its price is currently low. When purchasing any cryptocurrency, like Ether, one should always ensure that such a purchase makes sense economically and financially, based on one’s individual or household circumstances. To conclude, although Ethereum has lately been battered by some strong headwinds, the rise in the number of large holders, the potential for a market turnaround, and the sustained development of the Ethereum network all suggest that the current market pessimism may be short-lived. Most likely, the Ethereum holders who remain patient and keep an eye on the long-term horizon will, in the end, see something akin to a reward in whatever recovery the market makes—this future being, of course, contingent on Ethereum’s maintaining its adaptability and its (with some notable exceptions like EOS) ongoing presence in the lead pack of blockchain platforms.

The founder of FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange, and Alameda Research, a cryptocurrency trading firm, was once a prominent figure in the crypto industry. His charisma met a dark end when the fraud committed by his organisation was exposed. On March 28, 2024, he was sentenced to over 25 years in prison , three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay $11 billion in forfeiture for his orchestration of multiple fraudulent schemes. This is our side of the story. Recently, in an interview with Tucker Carlson, he opened up about his side of the story. Don’t miss this!

Notably, although Bankman-Fried joined the interview virtually from prison, Carlson showed no hesitation to ask tough questions. The interview covered a wide variety of topics, from bankruptcy to life in prison. Undoubtedly, the statements he made about bankruptcy and political contributions are likely to trigger serious discussions in the crypto sector. Bankman-Fried Still Regrets Declaring Bankruptcy From his statements, it is clear that he does not believe that declaring bankruptcy was a wise decision. He claimed that if FTX had continued operating, it would have $93 billion in assets today. He even boasted that there was enough money to pay back users. This indicates that he does not think he committed any fraudulent activities. Sadly, there was no sign of remorse in his words. It is clear that he is keen on giving a political angle to his imprisonment. Bankman-Fried’s Political Contributions and Changing Views Earlier, Bankman-Fried was an ardent supporter of the Democratic Party. In 2020, his huge financial contributions to the party gained significant media attention. In the previous interview, he stated that he privately supported the Republican Party too. He also claimed that his decision to support the Republican Party played a key role in the collapse of his organisations. In his recent interview with Carlson as well, he asserted that his disillusionment with the Democratic Party led to his downfall. Bankman-Fried’s Appeal Efforts and Future Outlook In his first interview from prison, Bankman-Fried indirectly appealed for a pardon from US President Donald Trump . The Trump administration has not yet considered this appeal. Interestingly, in the latest interview, he showed no interest in appealing for a pardon.

They just minutes ago announced major increases in position with $MOVE, as well as considerable bolstering of their holdings in $WBTC and $ETH. This is very much in line with WILFI’s strategy to prepare for not just a bear nor bull market, but a series of volatile crypto market conditions over the next couple of years. New Acquisitions and Diversified Portfolio WLFI’s recent moves show its commitment to diversifying its investments in crypto. The firm has picked up 3.42 million $MOVE tokens, worth about 1.45 million USD. That’s part of a broader trend of trying to find investments with tremendous growth potential. In tandem with purchasing $MOVE, WLFI also grabbed 110,595 $WBTC tokens, worth around 9.95 million USD. At the same time, the firm added 4,468 $ETH to its holdings, worth about 9.96 million USD. Together, these moves suggest that WLFI is doubling down on some of the cryptocurrencies it’s already invested in and going across the board in the major space. By focusing heavily on both Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are often seen as gorgeously stable pillars in the digital asset space, WLFI has made these decisions. WLFI’s most recent acquisitions have pushed its total investment in cryptocurrency to an astounding 309 million USD, spanning a total of nine diverse tokens. The firm has demonstrated an unmistakable passion for putting money to work in crypto, even as that market has experienced some seriously turbulent times. Some of our own writers have gone so far as to advocate for viewing those price fluctuations as awesome entry points. And they’re not wrong. Active Portfolio Adjustments Amid Market Volatility The investment moves taken lately by WLFI in the digital currency market couldn’t come at a better time. This is because, in the last 24 hours, a number of the tokens that WLFI has invested in have seen not just good, but significant price increases. And those tokens include $AAVE and $ONDO, which this morning had price shifts that were right in line with the kind of movement that these two tokens typically make when they are about to break out and head higher. According to the last update, WLFI’s cumulative floating loss has reduced to $80.96 million, a marked gain from their previous losses. This shift is driven by the appreciation in the value of certain assets—like $AAVE and $ONDO—that have helped reduce the overall unrealized losses in WLFI’s portfolio. The recent uptick in asset values has thus served to narrow the cumulative floating loss, which is now more than half replaced by the returns that have come since the last update—amounting to a narrow gain and certainly a more favorable number for WLFI to report. 浮亏 8783 万美金？无所谓，总统自会使用「钞能力」 5 小时前特朗普 WLFI 一把增持了价值 2500 万美金的三种代币 – $MOVE ：342 万枚，约 145 万美金 – $WBTC ：110.595 枚，约 995 万美金 – $ETH ：4468 枚，约 996 万美金 至此，WLFI 已累计花费 3.09 亿美金主动购入 9 种代币；因 AAVE / ONDO… https://t.co/WRHs1iMk4o pic.twitter.com/IJzhWr76zy — Ai 姨 (@ai_9684xtpa) March 6, 2025 Of all the tokens in WLFI’s holdings, one standout is $TRX, the native token of the TRON blockchain. In the face of a tough market, $TRX has done a complete turnaround for WLFI, moving it from an unrealized loss up to a profitable position. Even with all the changes in the market, WLFI remains confident in the long-term vision of its held assets, like $TRX. This is a victory lap for $TRX within WLFI’s portfolio, and it does speak to the adaptability of WLFI as a firm. If nothing else, this is a nice thing to have in a portfolio while everything else seems to be crashing. Strategic Vision for the Future Recent investments by WLFI are a clear sign of the firm’s interest in taking strategic steps toward its future growth. In just the past week, for example, it invested in two different kinds of tokens: one very well-established ($WBTC) and the other still kind of new and uncertain ($MOVE). This sort of unfolding interest shows a couple of things: WLFI is building a portfolio of investments that cover a good range of both stable and kind-of-up-in-the-air digital assets. Over the next few months, WLFI is likely to continue making shifts that reflect its overarching approach of taking full advantage of key trends and market turns. The firm has shown a remarkable knack for going with the flow (or against it, when necessary) of the market, making it a player of note—if not significant—in the cryptocurrency investment world. As the market continues to mature, we believe that WLFI’s not-too-profile investments in such central assets as $ETH and $WBTC position it well for whatever the future has in store. In addition, WLFI’s active involvement in the cryptocurrency arena indicates that the firm may be on the lookout for even more ways to swell its coffers as conditions change in the crypto marketplace. That buying and holding of digital assets by WLFI could allow the firm to make some serious profits in the not-too-distant future also is suggested by the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency prices. Conclusion WLFI’s recent $25 million investment in $MOVE, $WBTC, and $ETH clearly shows their commitment to cryptocurrency as a long-term investment strategy. With a diversified portfolio and a keen eye for market trends, WLFI’s actions reflect a strong belief in the future growth potential of these key cryptocurrencies. Even as the crypto market continues to face serious headwinds, WLFI seems firmly positioned to remain a significant force, making strategic decisions that all but ensure its success in the years ahead.

The reserve will consist of Bitcoins seized by the government, and will not purchase BTC outside of these. White House cryptocurrency advisor David Sacks, who revealed details about the Bitcoin reserve, stated that the reserve will be funded by Bitcoins seized by the government through criminal or civil asset forfeiture and therefore will not impose any additional cost on taxpayers. According to Arkham data, the US government currently has 198,109 BTC in its wallet worth approximately $17 billion. However, not all of these BTCs belong to the US. The US may have a reserve of 88 thousand BTC, excluding the BTCs from Bitfinex. Galaxy Digital Research President Alex Thorn said in a post on his X account that the US government has approximately 198,000 BTC, but only a maximum of 88,000 BTC (43% of its holdings) can be used as reserves. Thorn stated that the remaining 112,000 BTC will be returned to the Bitfinex Exchange. As you may recall, Bitfinex lost 120,000 BTC in an attack in 2016, and the US government seized some of these funds. Finally, drawing attention to the US government’s sales, Lookonchain said that the US government previously sold approximately 222,684 BTC (worth around $3.28 billion at the time, and around $19.42 billion today) to Coinbase, Coinbase Prime, and other unknown wallets for an average price of $14,736. Accordingly, the US government lost approximately $16.14 billion at current prices by pre-selling BTC. we think current US bitcoin balance available for re-purpose into a reserve is max 88k BTC, only 43% of current government holdings. that’s bc of the ~198k BTC now held by USG, 112k BTC will be returned to bitfinex market will learn the difference between “seized” & “forfeited” — Alex Thorn (@intangiblecoins) March 7, 2025 *This is not investment advice.

South Korea is stepping into the spotlight, actively exploring the introduction of spot crypto ETFs . This exciting development, driven by global trends, could unlock new avenues for digital asset investment in the nation. Are you curious about what this means for the future of crypto in South Korea and beyond? Let’s dive in! South Korea Crypto ETF Exploration: Why Now? South Korea’s renewed interest in crypto ETFs isn’t happening in isolation. It’s a direct response to the growing global wave of acceptance and adoption of these financial instruments. Recent discussions at the National Assembly on March 7th, involving key figures from the ruling People Power Party (PPP), government bodies, and private sector experts, signal a serious consideration of this topic. This move underscores a proactive approach to align with international financial innovations. Why is this exploration so significant? Consider these key factors: Global Trend Following: The success and increasing popularity of spot Bitcoin ETFs in other regions, particularly in the United States, have likely spurred South Korea to re-evaluate its stance. Ignoring these trends could put South Korea at a disadvantage in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. Investor Demand: There’s a growing appetite among South Korean investors for regulated and accessible crypto investment products. ETFs provide a familiar and regulated framework, potentially attracting a broader range of investors into the crypto market. Economic Opportunities: Embracing crypto ETFs could stimulate economic growth within South Korea by attracting capital, fostering innovation in the financial sector, and positioning the country as a forward-thinking hub for digital assets. [img src=”image-placeholder.jpg” alt=”South Korea Crypto ETF Exploration”] Understanding Cryptocurrency Regulation in South Korea The discussion around crypto ETFs in South Korea is deeply intertwined with the nation’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation . Historically, South Korea has navigated a complex path, seeking to balance investor protection with fostering innovation. While there have been periods of strict regulations, the current exploration of ETFs suggests a potential shift towards a more accommodating stance. Kwon Seong-dong, floor leader of the PPP, highlighted the crucial need for a balanced regulatory framework. His emphasis on analyzing global trends and avoiding both excessive restrictions and lax oversight points towards a nuanced approach. This balanced approach is critical for creating a healthy ecosystem for digital assets to thrive while safeguarding investors. Here’s a quick look at some key aspects of South Korea’s regulatory considerations: Investor Protection: A primary concern for regulators is ensuring adequate investor protection within the volatile crypto market. ETFs, being regulated investment vehicles, could offer a layer of security and transparency compared to direct crypto ownership. Market Stability: Regulators need to assess the potential impact of crypto ETFs on market stability and prevent illicit activities. Robust regulatory frameworks are necessary to mitigate risks and maintain market integrity. Taxation and Compliance: Clear guidelines on taxation and compliance for digital assets , including ETFs, are essential for both investors and the industry to operate effectively within the legal framework. Investment Trends and the Global Crypto ETF Surge South Korea’s move to explore crypto ETFs is undeniably influenced by prevailing investment trends and the global enthusiasm surrounding these products. The successful launch and performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, for example, have demonstrated the potential of these instruments to attract significant capital and mainstream adoption. Globally, we are witnessing a clear shift in sentiment towards digital assets. Institutional investors are increasingly showing interest, and retail investors are seeking easier and regulated ways to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies. Crypto ETFs bridge this gap by offering a traditional investment vehicle for a novel asset class. Consider these global trends: Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions worldwide are warming up to cryptocurrencies, with some even launching their own crypto-related products and services. Retail Investor Access: Crypto ETFs democratize access to cryptocurrency investment, making it easier for everyday investors to participate without needing to navigate the complexities of direct crypto ownership and storage. Diversification Benefits: For many investors, digital assets are seen as a valuable diversification tool, and ETFs provide a convenient way to incorporate them into a portfolio. What are the Potential Benefits of Crypto ETFs in South Korea? Introducing crypto ETFs in South Korea could bring a range of advantages, benefiting both investors and the broader financial ecosystem: Increased Market Liquidity: ETFs can boost liquidity in the South Korean crypto market by attracting more trading volume and capital inflows. Enhanced Investor Access: Crypto ETFs would provide a more accessible and regulated avenue for South Korean investors to participate in the cryptocurrency market, potentially attracting those who were previously hesitant due to regulatory uncertainties or complexities. Legitimacy and Mainstream Adoption: The introduction of ETFs can further legitimize cryptocurrencies as an asset class and accelerate mainstream adoption within South Korea. Competitive Financial Market: By embracing financial innovation, South Korea can enhance its competitiveness in the global financial market and attract investment and talent. Challenges and Considerations for South Korea While the exploration of crypto ETFs is promising, South Korea must also carefully consider potential challenges and navigate complexities: Regulatory Framework Development: Establishing a robust and clear regulatory framework specifically for crypto ETFs is crucial. This includes addressing issues like custody, valuation, and market surveillance. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility. Regulators need to implement measures to manage risks associated with ETF products linked to such volatile assets. Public Awareness and Education: Ensuring public awareness and investor education about the risks and opportunities associated with crypto ETFs is essential for responsible adoption. International Collaboration: Given the global nature of crypto markets, international collaboration and coordination on regulatory standards and best practices will be beneficial. Actionable Insights: What to Watch For For those keenly following the developments in South Korea and the broader crypto landscape, here are some actionable insights: Monitor Regulatory Announcements: Keep a close watch on announcements from South Korean regulatory bodies and government officials regarding crypto ETFs . Any policy changes or statements will be crucial indicators. Track National Assembly Discussions: Follow discussions and debates within the National Assembly related to digital asset regulation and crypto ETFs . This will provide insights into the direction of policy-making. Observe Global ETF Performance: Analyze the performance and market impact of existing crypto ETFs in other regions, particularly in the US and Europe. This can offer valuable lessons and benchmarks for South Korea. Engage with Industry Experts: Stay informed by engaging with crypto industry experts, analysts, and commentators who are closely tracking South Korea’s crypto regulatory landscape. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for South Korean Crypto? South Korea’s exploration of crypto ETFs marks a potentially pivotal moment for its cryptocurrency market. Driven by global trends and a growing recognition of the potential of digital assets, this move could reshape the investment trends in the nation and solidify South Korea’s position in the evolving global financial landscape. While challenges remain, the commitment to a balanced regulatory approach signals a promising future for digital assets and cryptocurrency regulation in South Korea.

41271380,https://nulltx.com/?p=146731,1741333847,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Ethena Unveils Major $ENA Unlock, $741M in Tokens Released",https://nulltx.com/ethena-unveils-major-ena-unlock-741m-in-tokens-released/,"A significant event in the cryptocurrency market occurred yesterday when Ethena , a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) project, unlocked a phenomenal 2.07 billion $ENA tokens. This represents a huge uptick in deposits to our major trading partners. To look at this rationally, the unlocked tokens (less than 45% of which are registered in exchange wallets) represent about 39.17% of the $ENA tokens in circulation; so people were naturally concerned. Bear in mind, though, that just 25% of the unlocked tokens are supposed to have any effect on the $ENA price, and only when they are used in trading. Oh, and also remember: to look at this rationally. According to @Tokenomist_ai , #Ethena unlocked 2.07B $ENA ($740.71M, 39.17% of the circulating supply) yesterday. In the past 2 days, 12 wallets deposited 125M $ENA ($45M) to #Binance , #Bybit and #FalconX . pic.twitter.com/q4zimVjwI4 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 6, 2025 Massive Token Movement to Major Exchanges The recent unlocking of $ENA comes during an uptick in activity around the token. Since late last week, a number of wallets and addresses have begun transferring and depositing large amounts of $ENA into major centralized exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and FalconX. In just the last two days, 12 different wallets have made sizable deposits of $ENA totaling around 125 million tokens, worth an impressive $45 million, onto those platforms. Concerns are emerging, meanwhile, among investors that all this $ENA hitting the market could create some serious downward price momentum. In the last 18 hours, the multi-signature wallet of Ethena Labs has been very lively indeed, transferring a colossal 94.16 million ENA tokens—worth around $33.7 million—to no fewer than 33 different addresses. These serial movements appear to form part of a much larger planned release of ENA tokens, some 2.07 billion of which are expected to be unlocked over a not-to-distant horizon. The wallet distributing these ENA tokens to so many different places obviously raises a gigantic question mark over the project’s tokenomics. These transfers are remarkable for their sheer scale and for involving major players in the process. It appears that a lot of the freshly unlocked $ENA tokens are making their way to a handful of concentrated exchanges and wallets, which sets us up for some short-term price action. Key Players and Distribution of $ENA Among the recent recipients of transfers of $ENA, two names stand out for their size and significance. OKX Ventures, the investment arm of leading exchange OKX, received a hefty 17.87 million $ENA tokens. This is a substantial and strategic move in terms of securing a foothold in a project like Ethena and suggests that OKX, as a major player in the crypto space, may have future intentions to engage with Ethena or its ecosystem. Alongside OKX Ventures, Michael Egorov of Curve Finance received 2.8 million $ENA tokens. Egorov is a well-known name in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector and one that adds to the credibility of $ENA and the Ethena project in terms of their potential and future success. Both OKX Ventures and Michael Egorov have deposited their $ENA tokens on Binance, indicating that these tokens might soon be available for trading or could be employed as liquidity. Given their excellent track record and deep involvement in DeFi, the presence of either one of these high-profile individuals could have a meaningful impact on the near-term trajectory of $ENA’s price and its position in the broader crypto market. Market Reactions and Price Dynamics Currently, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or Binance have been given a total of 59.3 million $ENA tokens worth approximately $21.08 million. The average price of these tokens has been at $0.355, according to Dune Analytics. However, this average price seems to indicate that market participants are selling. They seem to be selling because they expect the large supply of newly unlocked tokens to depress the price. And in fact that’s what seems to be happening. In the past 18 hours, @ethena_labs ' multi-sig transferred 94.16M $ENA ($33.7M) to 33 addresses, likely part of this week's 2.07B $ENA unlock ($741M, 39.17% of circ. supply). So far, 59.3M $ENA ($21.08M) has been sold on DEXs or sent to #Binance at an average price of $0.355.… pic.twitter.com/IULgQBJCbj — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) March 6, 2025 The $ENA token’s distribution, especially over such a short span of time, might well create some price volatility as the tokens find their proper value in the market. But, really, the situation is not as dynamic as it might first seem. The multi-sig wallet from which these funds are being distributed holds actually quite a bit of $ENA. And that put together with the half billion tokens in the reserve wallet means the price dynamics that underpin the $ENA scene are pretty stable. The Road Ahead for $ENA and Ethena Labs As we move ahead, the continued distribution of $ENA tokens looks set to prompt a number of market reactions as investors process all those new tokens. And while we fully expect Ethena’s long-term game plan to kick in soon and stabilize things, for the time being, there’s no sugarcoating what’s likely to happen to the $ETHENA price when investors see a new torrent of tokens being dumped on them. As $ENA gets into the hands of more investors and prominent market players, its future will almost certainly pay homage to the stock trading laws of supply and demand. Lots of newly unlocked tokens might flood the market. The next few weeks will tell if Ethena can bolster investor confidence enough for $ENA to withstand that onslaught. If the price holds up, that might very well be a good sign. If, on the contrary, the price and the market behave in a manner reminiscent of the express elevator scene in “The Tower of Terror,” that also might be a good sign in the sense that it doesn’t seem like the price is dramatically unfurling any flags of investor confidence. To sum up, the Ethena project and its investors find themselves at a crucial juncture with the release of 2.07 billion ENA tokens locked up for two years. High-profile venture capitalists got involved, and now a significant quantity of the tokens is heading for cryptocurrency exchanges. What could happen next? Well, the project could become more volatile, or we could see a breakout. The crucial thing here is how Ethena manages itself at this new stage in its life cycle.

The secretary defended Trump’s policies, saying the president was trying to transition the economy to a private sector-powered one. Speaking at the Economic Club of New York on Thursday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent commented that President Donald Trump was trying to transition the public sector-powered economy to a private sector-powered one. Bessent highlights the need to reprivatize the economy US Treasury secretary Scott Bessent revealed Trump’s administration’s plan to unleash private sector growth and address the previous administration’s mistakes. He pointed out that the government was cutting unnecessary spending under Trump’s leadership. Bessent added that Biden’s administration’s overregulation stifled innovation within the United States. Amid all the excitement and news today, I almost forgot I had the opportunity to hear @USTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s remarks at @EconClubNY this afternoon. One of my takeaways: Bessent said that to start fixing the economy and the mistakes of the last administration,… pic.twitter.com/4ztdeeJByp — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) March 7, 2025 The secretary highlighted that permanent tax cuts, reduced corporate rates, and expanded small business deductions would be paired with deregulation to lower costs and boost investment. He said suspending the Corporate Transparency Act would ensure millions of small businesses were freed from burdensome reporting. In his first economic policy address, Bessent commented that the US economy’s reliance on the public sector for job growth was stunted. The government official was vocal about Biden’s administration’s overspending, saying its policies led to increased inflation. He explained that the Biden administration left the US with an economy that may have exhibited some reasonable metrics at face value but was brittle. He explained that 95% of all job growth in the past year was concentrated in public and government adjacent sectors. Bessent said these jobs offered slower wage growth and less productivity than private-sector jobs. He reiterated that the private sector had been in rescission, and their goal was to reprivatize the economy. The official pointed out that employment in manufacturing, information technology, and mining flatlined over the same period. The Secretary said Trump’s administration was working to create more jobs in the private sector. He added that some measures the president implemented to achieve this included extending tax cuts, slashing regulations, and rebalancing the United States economy through tariff policies. Bessent comments on Washington’s trade tariffs Bessent dismissed the tariff concerns, saying they were necessary for long-term stability and to create America’s first competitiveness. He defended the White House’s position on tariffs, saying Trump was ready to take strong measures to achieve his trade goals. The government official emphasized that trade policy had to be more than acquiring low-priced items from other countries. He said that access to cheap goods was not the essence of the American dream. Bessent added that the American dream was rooted in the concept that everyone could access economic security and upward mobility. He added that previous administrations have lost sight of the dream when it comes to multilateral trade deals. He emphasized that the government would respond when other countries’ policies harmed the United States economy and its citizens. Bessent clarified that this was America’s first trade policy. Commerce Department data revealed how far the United States fell behind its global trading partners. It highlighted the imbalance, which increased to H$131.4 billion in January, a 34% increase from December 2024. Bessent commented that he was not worried about inflation across the continuum. He explained that Trump considered tariffs to have three benefits, including protecting industries and workers from unfair practices. The government official added that the tariffs would also act as a source of revenue for the United States. He also emphasized that Trump would use the tariffs as a negotiation tool. The Treasury secretary predicted that Trump’s economic agenda would help reduce interest rates and increase market confidence in the long-term U.S. fiscal profile. Canada and Mexico responded to the trade tariffs, saying they were unfair and unreasonable. Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada would remain in a trade war with the United States for the foreseeable future. He added that his government would continue discussing with Trump’s administration to seek the tariff removal. The prime minister noted that Canada’s reciprocal tariffs would remain in place until Washington withdrew theirs. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

41271505,https://nulltx.com/?p=146729,1741334035,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Ethereum Investors Navigate Volatility, Strategically Adjusting Exposure Amid Price Fluctuations",https://nulltx.com/ethereum-investors-navigate-volatility-strategically-adjusting-exposure-amid-price-fluctuations/,"Ethereum (ETH) investors have been very active in the past few weeks, managing their positions in the asset and showing a clear understanding of the market when it has been in a volatile state. After seeing a high at around $2,500 in early February, the price of ETH has tried to backtrack a few times but has continued to fall closer to its last low of around $2,050—a price not seen since November 2023. As the asset continues to price flip-flop, we have been using on-chain data to gain some additional insights into just how and why investors have been moving in and out of the asset during these last few weeks. Ethereum’s latest Cost Basis Distribution analysis reveals a dynamic capital movement across price levels and distinct investor behavior during this period. It shows that lower prices have not led to large market participants accumulating more ETH, clearly demonstrating that our previous thesis of “accumulation below $3K” was misguided. In fact, having ETH approach the $2K price point now looks like a price floor. Moreover, investors who initially acquired ETH at significantly higher prices seem to have sold into the recent rally. But in contrast to what much lower prices might otherwise suggest, having ETH not only previously accumulate but now look to have a price floor seems to have led to more selling. Key Investor Activity Amid Market Shifts Now, if we focus individually on each of the aforementioned three months, the allocation from the first month shows us that investors—who conducted their initial ETH purchases at or around the $3,500 price point—engaged substantially with both the local peak of $2,500 and also during the retracement to $2,050. During February, these ETH holders took advantage of the strategic buy situations. More importantly, they were also able to up their market-making game by lowering their exposure during the dip in a strategic buy moment of their own. All said and done, they now hold approximately 1.75 million ETH with an average cost basis of about $3,200. This positions management underlines a trend of Ethereum investors choosing risk-aware strategies. Many investors haven’t just sat around waiting for the market to do its thing; they’ve worked the market, using its fluctuations to help reduce their exposure to a price that’s seeming a bit too high for comfort. Besides indicating a possible top in the market, this also suggests Ethereum investors are getting better at tuning in to the market’s signals—for better or worse. At approximately 500,000 ETH at $2,200 on March 1, investors seized upon near-the-lower-end price movement to make the kind of accumulation that’s been the hall-mark of Ethereum investor action during this recent volatile period. The immediate subsequent movement in assets was up again in price, lighting up some kind of overvaluation radar, as it happens, that’s been the counterpoint to the kind of market dip-buying we’ve been talking about since the early part of this year. And as for the selling-as-overvaluation-signals market behavior? Can’t say we’re too surprised to see it being practiced by none other than Ethereum investors. Under the investor radar, Ethereum dips have been good buying opportunities. They seem to have netted gains on immediate term moves since. #Ethereum investors actively managed their exposure through this volatile period. After a rally to $2.5K, $ETH retraced to $2.05K – levels last seen in Nov 2023. Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) shows how capital rotated across price levels and who took advantage of the dip. pic.twitter.com/vl6AdghfRO — glassnode (@glassnode) March 5, 2025 Resistance Levels and Key Price Points to Watch Later, when I look ahead, the price levels around $2,800 have emerged as a crucial resistance point for Ethereum. On-chain data reveals that around 800,000 ETH has been accumulated at or near this price level, signaling a significant supply zone where selling pressure could increase should the price rise back toward these levels. This resistance zone will likely serve as a key point to watch during any potential recovery, as it could either mark a temporary ceiling for the price or serve as a launching pad for further gains if it is breached. The pile-up at $2,800 shows that a large chunk of investors have purchased ETH at that price, and as we get nearer to that price again, these folks might be more likely to sell than to buy, thus exerting downward pressure on Ethereum’s price, as these investors seek to pocket the profits that would seem to be theirs at $2,800. In effect, this situation creates a double bind: either ETH is stuck under $2,800, or it goes significantly past that price and somehow manages to hold. The actions of investors at reduced price levels continues to pique interest, though. Why? Because it’s one thing to be a buy-and-hold investor when the price is going up and quite another to not freak out when you see the price pull back. Accumulating, in this case, 500,000 ETH at $2,200 and then not freaking out when it was $1,900 but OMG WOWING it back at $2,500 and now at $3,500 is kind of an impressive feat of emotional stability. But it also raises two questions: Why are these not-very-affluent investors buying during downturns and then selling during upswings? And how is it that sell orders for these supposedly profit-taking trades seem to coincide with price increases? Long-Term Outlook for Ethereum While the wider cryptocurrency market is blowing hot and cold, Ethereum stays close to the center. Consequently, its price is what most of us are looking at, and not just us plebeians, but also the big boys in the space (or what passes for “the big boys” in this still-nascent industry). Unlike a year or so back, when lots of folks talked up Ethereum’s being the next bitcoin, Ethereum seems to have settled back to being a cryptocurrency that does lots of interesting stuff, while the price just kinda hovers. In the near term, not just the actions of investors but also the conditions in the overall marketplace—such as regulation, the adoption of Ethereum 2.0, and the growth of DeFi—will determine how Ethereum’s price performs. If Ethereum can move above and maintain key resistance levels including and especially around $2,800, it can continue to shape its upward price trajectory. To sum up, Ethereum investors are showing a high level of engagement and strategic positioning during this turbulent period of price action. They are actively adjusting their exposure and capitalizing on the price swings to try to reduce their initial cost basis and set themselves up for potential future gains. They have eyes on the key price levels that Ethereum is approaching, including the $2,800 resistance, and in this ongoing price action of the cryptocurrency market, many are looking to see what happens next with Ethereum.

This week’s event is much smaller than last week’s end-of-month expiry, but a mammoth end-of-quarter contract expiry is due on March 28. The impact on spot markets is likely to be minimal as all eyes are on the White House crypto summit , also taking place today. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s tranche of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.67, meaning that there are slightly more call (long) contracts expiring than puts (shorts). Moreover, open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, remains high at the $120,000 strike price, which is $1.4 billion, according to Deribit. There is also over $1 billion in OI at the $100,000 and $110,000 strike prices. Bearish sentiment is also seeping back as $750,000 in OI currently sits at the $80,000 and $70,000 strike prices. Crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live said the group was still “predominantly bearish,” adding that traders were “anticipating further downside while experiencing frustration with extreme chop and volatility.” It added that most traders were watching the $87k to $89k range as key resistance, with $82k noted as a recent bottom, “though there is significant disagreement on whether a sustainable bottom has been found.” “Market experiencing extreme price swings with Bitcoin moving $6k in a day, creating what traders describe as ‘scam both ways’ price action.” Bitcoin OI by expiry. Source: Deribit Around 223,000 Ethereum contracts are also expiring today, with a notional value of $482 million and a put/call ratio of 0.71. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $3 billion. “Trump tariff announcements (and subsequent reversals) are contributing to market confusion, with many traders sitting out due to unpredictable price action,” Greeks concluded. Spot Market Tanks Markets have been extremely volatile over the past 24 hours, with total capitalization dumping around $200 billion following Donald Trump’s executive order for a strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Bitcoin tanked almost 6%, falling from above $90,000 to $85,000 in less than an hour before it bounced off to $88,000. The response came as White House crypto czar David Sacks said the reserve would be capitalized by BTC already seized by the US government. Retail took this to mean the US would not be buying any more BTC for its SBR and dumped the asset. However, the small print states that the Treasury and Commerce secretaries have been directed by Trump to find “budget neutral” ways to acquire BTC. Nevertheless, crypto markets remain in the red this Friday morning.

Gox Transfers 11,834 BTC to New Wallet Amidst Growing Speculation",https://nulltx.com/mt-gox-transfers-11834-btc-to-new-wallet-amidst-growing-speculation/,"In a move that has caught the cryptocurrency world by surprise, Mt. Gox, formerly one of the largest and most infamous Bitcoin exchanges, has transferred an astounding 11,834 BTC (around $1.07 billion at the current price) into a new wallet. This transfer—Mt. Gox’s first major move in over two months—has naturally led to a great deal of speculation about what could be in store for the now-defunct Bitcoin exchange and its creditors. Creditors have been waiting for a long time now to hear what could be going on with a resolution to the bankruptcy proceedings. The latest major development with the exchange, in any case, raises the question: Is this the first sign that Mt. Gox could finally be moving toward a resolution? A Significant Move After Months of Inactivity The last significant thing Mt. Gox did in the world of cryptocurrency was on December 24, 2024. Aside from that day, it has been fairly quiet. So, when it made headlines in early March 2025, people paid attention. And for good reason: what it did was transfer an immense sum of Bitcoin—over $1 billion worth, to be precise. To some analysts and enthusiasts, this is just the latest bizarre twist in the ongoing story of Mt. Gox, a formerly top-tier Bitcoin exchange that has been in bankruptcy since 2014. Even though it was one of the earliest and most prominent Bitcoin exchanges before its 2014 collapse, Mt. Gox has stayed an enigma in the crypto world. Where most exchanges have either shut down or gone into bankruptcy over the last nearly 10 years (200Euros, Cryptsy, etc.), Mt. Gox has carried on with winding up in a way that resembles the winding up of a scam. Nevertheless, with the 11,000+ BTC still held by Mt. Gox as a ghost asset, many in the crypto world have continued to speculate on what might become of those BTC. Mt. Gox transferred 11,834 $BTC ($1.07B) to a new wallet an hour ago, likely as part of an internal move! Notably, between November 1 and December 24, 2024, Mt. Gox transferred a total of 8,820 $BTC (~$760M) to #B2C2 Group. Currently, Mt. Gox still holds 24,245 $BTC ($2.19B)… https://t.co/ngA1qrNNan pic.twitter.com/40BnBPWQOM — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) March 6, 2025 The first large-scale movement of funds from Mt. Gox in two months is obviously significant. The timing and size of the transfer have, therefore, been closely watched and have prompted several theories among observers of the situation. One theory has it that this recent transfer was an attempted test prior to a larger fund movement. Another theory suggests that the funds were actually transferred to the creditors of Mt. Gox. Mt. Gox’s Recent Transactions and Holdings From November 1 to December 24, 2024, B2C2 Group, a major liquidity provider in the cryptocurrency realm, received total transfers of 8,820 BTC from Mt. Gox. The equivalent roughly to $760 million at the time, this earlier transfer to B2C2 Group marked the first major transaction in a larger series undertaken by the exchange in the fall of 2024 with the intent of liquidating its remaining holdings and settling outstanding liabilities. The most recent transfer of 11,834 BTC further increases the total amount of Bitcoin moved in recent months. This brings the total sum of Bitcoin that has been transferred from Mt. Gox in the past few months to approximately 20,000 BTC (around $1.83 billion). However, Mt. Gox still holds a substantial stash of 24,245 BTC (valued at approximately $2.19 billion), remaining one of the largest Bitcoin holders in the world. The amount of BTC still in Mt. Gox’s possession has been a topic of constant speculation. Although the exchange’s asset liquidation has progressed significantly, a large amount of BTC still remains. The bankruptcy negotiations have been long and winding, overdue despite their complexity, and sometimes delayed by too many lawyers in too many rooms for comfort. No one really knows how long this is going to take—but tt seems likely that the way forward will be cleared only by a combination of resolution in the negotiation room and resolution in court. The Road Ahead for Mt. Gox Creditors Currently, the destiny of the leftover Bitcoin stored at Mt. Gox is up in the air. The exchange’s creditors, a good many of whom seem to be living in an era more like 2014 than 2023, keep a close watch on this slow-moving situation because they have been promised that this, at long last, will yield something resembling a payback. And creditors will be very much in the spotlight when, and if, this tale of woe reaches any kind of conclusion. Beyond that, it isn’t clear why anyone should care. Mt. Gox’s trustee, Nobuaki Kobayashi, has been urged time and again to speed up the payout process. But overcoming the myriad of obstacles impeding the payout—obstacles that include legal and technical issues—that’s been like trying to get blood from a stone. A recent transfer of Bitcoin into a new wallet, for example, has not changed the payout timeline in any way that’s immediately noticeable. So consider it a reminder, if you need one, that the Mt. Gox saga isn’t over yet. For the investing public, the activity at Mt. Gox should serve as a cautionary tale about the risks and complexities of putting money into digital assets. It is becoming increasingly clear that whatever happens next in the Gox saga—it appears that lawyers for the exchange will be seeking clarity on certain still unsettled legal issues—will have huge ramifications not just for the crypto community but also for the many people who used to trade on the exchange. The question now seems to be not if creditors will be made whole but rather when that will happen. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

41271714,https://nulltx.com/?p=146727,1741334359,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Evolution of Token Release Strategies: Q1 2024 vs. Q1 2025,https://nulltx.com/evolution-of-token-release-strategies-q1-2024-vs-q1-2025/,"The cryptocurrency market might be maturing, but it’s far from settled. How tokenomics are evolving is a good symbol of this inevitable march toward a new order. And because this new order is still taking shape, it allows us to discern several key trends simply by looking at new project release schedules. What are these trends? What kinds of release strategies are new projects adopting? What implications do they have for market liquidity, long-term sustainability, and investor strategies? Let’s dig in. Higher Initial Unlocks in 2024, Gradual Emissions in 2025 The difference that stands out the most when comparing tokens launched in Q1 2024 with those from Q1 2025 is the initial unlock structure. When looking at early 2024 tokens, you see a much higher first-year emissions number relative to the 2025 tokens. When you look at the 2024 tokens, most of them release more than half of their total supply in the first year. That certainly seems to reflect an aggressive market entry. For example, XAI shines with a remarkable 69.77% of its overall supply made available to the market in the first year post-launch. Other tokens, such as ONDO and ETHFI, also feature significant first-year unlock percentages, with 57.53% and 56.79%, respectively, but none come close to the XAI percentage. This rapid emission strategy — and it is a strategy — is almost certainly aimed at driving early liquidity and adoption and incentivizing potential users to take a look at the offering post-launch. The strategy may very well be a direct response to competitive pressures. In contrast, in an aggressive unlocking strategy, tokens are made available in such large volumes that it creates a risk of volatility. Such was the case with MATIC during its first year of availability. Having just launched at a price of $0.0025 in May 2019, MATIC shot up in value to $0.10 in June and then, even more significantly, to $0.26 by September 2019. However, in the latter half of its first year, MATIC was in the unfortunate position of being strongly correlated with a downtrending overall crypto market, which in turn was impacting many individual projects. By contrast, the tokens introduced in the first quarter of 2025 are taking a considerably more cautious approach. Many of these tokens are following slower, more controlled emission schedules that stress long-term sustainability over immediate liquidity. Their first-year unlocks tend to be much lower, reflecting a contrasted choice for the tokens—or their creators, at least—in favor of longer vesting periods before full access. Consider BIO and ANIME: their first-year emissions are only 15.60% and 25.49%, respectively, a big step down from the kind of levels we were seeing in last year’s batch of tokens. Despite this overall trend toward slower emissions, certain 2025 tokens, such as BERA (56.89%), seem to have more aggressive unlock schedules. Nevertheless, this appears to be more the exception than the rule. Shift Toward Controlled Emissions in 2025 Tokens An emerging trend from the comparison is a noticeable shift in token release strategies between 2024 and 2025. The former emphasized immediate liquidity and high first-year unlocks. The latter, however, seems to favor a more gradual and sustainable emission strategy. This shift is likely a response to the challenges faced by early-stage projects with aggressive unlock schedules. Tokens released in Q1 2025 appear to be adopting a much more balanced approach to emissions that extends beyond the first year. For instance, a number of projects, such as LAYER and KAITO, distribute their emissions evenly across several years, which provides a much smoother and far more predictable release schedule. This layout should, in theory, help avoid the kind of sell pressure that can occur when a token appears to be unlocking in huge amounts all at once. And while some projects that started in 2025 also seem to be adopting a staggered release strategy, several others, like BIO, IP, and KAITO, appear to be distributing their emissions evenly across a number of years and well into Year 5. Emissions decline sharply in most token models following Year 1. For instance, JUP released 36.73% of its supply in the first year, but then that dropped all the way down to 0%. ETHFI was slightly better in that respect. After the first year, it released a not-so-breath-taking 7.53% in the third year, after having released 56.79% in the first year. So far, in the first couple of years of existence, these tokens have been creating a fair amount of price pressure in the market. They’ve even been leading to a certain amount of price instability. The reason is that if you’re a JUP or an ETHFI holder, what incentive do you have to hold it when you know that almost all of the supply is eventually going to be released, and the price is way more unstable than it might otherwise be? How are token release strategies evolving? By comparing Q1 2024 vs. Q1 2025 tokens, we can uncover key trends in emissions and their market impact. Key Findings: – Higher First-Year Unlocks for 2024 tokens – More Gradual Emission Trends for 2025 tokens – Sharp Declines in… pic.twitter.com/6tNM0FJ0Y9 — Tokenomist (prev. TokenUnlocks) (@Tokenomist_ai) March 5, 2025 Looking Ahead: A More Sustainable Approach This transition to a more gradual emission and long-term unlock strategy signals a shift in the tokenomics of new projects. The pressure first-year emissions put on short-term prices—and the volatility these emissions have caused—are clear lessons learned from past tokens. These tokens tend to do better over the long haul if they don’t have a first-year price chart that looks like this (insert chart). So if emission schedules are supposed to produce tokens that retain more value over time, what do those in 2025 look like? For investors and traders, understanding these changing release strategies is crucial for making informed decisions. Tokens with slower, more controlled emissions offer more predictable market behavior, while those with rapid unlocks might offer significant short-term gains but at the cost of higher volatility. As the market matures, this evolution in release strategies could lay the groundwork for tokens which are more sustainable in appearance, and whether they actually are or not, that token projects will offer sustainable growth instead of the unsustainable hype that precedes a downturn. To sum up, the difference between the tokens of Q1 2024 and the tokens of Q1 2025 shows that projects are now following a better tokenomics approach. Projects in Q1 2025 are following more sustainable emission patterns that will provide reliable initial liquidity without immediately flooding the market with tokens. This trend, if it continues, could serve as a decent blueprint for the next bull phase. Emphasis is obviously now on long-term viability and stability.

Various analysts suggest that the flagship’s crypto performance could “go either direction” depending on the White House crypto summit’s outcome. Related Reading: Stellar (XLM) Price Setting Up For Rally To $1.60 – Here Are The Levels To Watch Bitcoin Price To See Volatile Friday Over the past two days, the crypto market has recovered from this week’s lows ahead of the US crypto summit. Last Friday, news that US President Donald Trump would host the first-ever White House crypto summit filled investors and industry participants with bullish expectations. Scheduled for March 7, several high-profile figures will attend the event, including Strategy’s Michael Saylor, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, and Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev. Since Tuesday, Bitcoin’s price has surged around 9% from the $81,500 support to surpass the $90,000 barrier, but some market watchers have warned investors about the expected volatility for Friday’s crypto summit. Analyst Altcoin Sherpa noted that Bitcoin “doesn’t have much clarity on higher timeframes” despite retesting its post-November breakout range and holding the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Sherpa suggested holding the $89,000 support is key for BTC’s price as the crypto summit’s volatility leaves “all options on the table.” He added that the crypto market will likely “whipsaw in both directions” this Friday. Meanwhile, trader Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that Bitcoin’s current levels are worth watching over the next few days, as it “is still struggling to hold on to the range, but bears have also failed a further breakdown after the initial rejection.” Nonetheless, he considers that the crypto summit is a “very promising sign for the next 4 years,” regardless of the outcome: It’s something we couldn’t have dreamt of the past few years. With the industry being attacked on a regular basis. Let’s hope the focus will be on the right things and that the administration is choosing the right way to do things. BTC Recovery Targets Surge To $140,000 Analyst Crypto Jelle affirmed that “things are developing well, but it all hinges on the crypto event on Friday.” He noted that an underwhelming event could trigger another sell-off, as there aren’t other potential bullish catalysts on the horizon. Jelle also advised investors “Don’t get too excited until we get some more clarity.” However, he highlighted a Potential Power of 3 (PO3) forming on BTC’s chart, targeting $140,000 “once range lows are successfully reclaimed.” This pattern divides the price cycle into three distinctive phases. In the first phase, accumulation, the price consolidates near the recent high following strong price action. The second phase, manipulation, consists of a token’s price falling below the previous phase’s support level and trading within a range below this zone. The third phase, distributions, sees a strong price breakout, building momentum and driving participants to enter the market.

Holding through the $90,000-$92,000 zone “would trigger the power of three set up” third phase, which would see BTC’s price expand to new highs. After today’s rejection from the $90,000 range, the analyst signaled that Bitcoin could form a higher low around $87,500 before retesting the range lows again. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $88,372, a 1.3% drop in the daily timeframe.

41271706,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=137899,1741334425,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Warning: Will U.S. Bitcoin Reserves Trigger Global FOMO?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-bitcoin-reserves-global-fomo/,"Are you ready for a potential seismic shift in the global financial landscape? Imagine a world where nations scramble to accumulate Bitcoin, driven by the fear of being left behind. This isn’t just crypto speculation; it’s a scenario being seriously discussed by experts. Matthew Pines, Executive Director of the Bitcoin Policy Institute, believes the United States holding strategic Bitcoin reserves could be the catalyst for a worldwide phenomenon: global FOMO . Why U.S. Bitcoin Reserves Could Ignite Global FOMO The concept of strategic Bitcoin holdings by a nation-state, especially one as influential as the United States, carries significant weight. Pines’s statement, made in a recent Bitcoin Magazine interview, highlights a critical dynamic. Here’s why U.S. involvement in Bitcoin reserves could trigger widespread global FOMO : Legitimacy and Validation: When the U.S. government, a global superpower, starts treating Bitcoin as a strategic asset, it sends a powerful message. It validates Bitcoin as more than just a speculative digital currency. This move can signal to other nations that Bitcoin is a serious contender in the future of finance. Fear of Being Left Behind: Nations constantly compete for economic and geopolitical advantage. If the U.S. is perceived to be gaining an edge by holding Bitcoin reserves , other countries may feel compelled to follow suit to avoid being left behind in a potentially Bitcoin-dominated future. This is the core of global FOMO in this context. Geopolitical Implications: Strategic Bitcoin holdings can be seen as a new form of geopolitical power. Countries with Bitcoin reserves might be perceived as more financially resilient and independent, especially in a world increasingly questioning the dominance of traditional financial systems. Scarcity Amplification: Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins is a fundamental aspect of its value proposition. As nations begin accumulating Bitcoin reserves , the available supply in the open market decreases, potentially driving up demand and further fueling global FOMO . The Bitcoin Policy Institute: Shaping the Narrative on US Bitcoin Policy To understand the context of Pines’s statement, it’s crucial to know about the Bitcoin Policy Institute. This nonprofit organization plays a vital role in shaping the discourse around US Bitcoin policy . Their mission is to conduct in-depth research on Bitcoin’s policy implications and its broader impact on society and emerging monetary networks. By focusing on factual analysis and reasoned arguments, the Bitcoin Policy Institute aims to: Educate Policymakers: Provide unbiased research and insights to policymakers to help them understand Bitcoin and its potential. Promote Sound Bitcoin Policy: Advocate for policies that foster innovation and responsible growth in the Bitcoin ecosystem within the U.S. Foster Public Understanding: Increase public awareness and understanding of Bitcoin’s societal and economic implications through research and educational initiatives. The Bitcoin Policy Institute’s work is essential in navigating the complex landscape of US Bitcoin policy and ensuring informed decision-making at the governmental level. Strategic Bitcoin Holdings: Benefits and Challenges The idea of strategic Bitcoin holdings by nations is not without its complexities. Let’s explore both the potential benefits and challenges: Benefits of Strategic Bitcoin Holdings Benefit Description Diversification of Reserves Bitcoin offers a decentralized, non-sovereign asset that is uncorrelated with traditional markets, providing diversification beyond gold and fiat currencies. Hedge Against Inflation With its limited supply, Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against inflation, potentially preserving national wealth in times of economic uncertainty. Enhanced Financial Independence Holding Bitcoin reserves can reduce reliance on traditional financial systems and potentially offer greater financial autonomy. Technological Leadership Embracing Bitcoin can position a nation as a leader in the burgeoning digital asset space, attracting innovation and talent. Challenges of Strategic Bitcoin Holdings Challenge Description Volatility Concerns Bitcoin’s price volatility can be a concern for national reserves, requiring robust risk management strategies. Regulatory Uncertainty The regulatory landscape for Bitcoin is still evolving globally, creating uncertainties for nations holding it as a reserve asset. Security and Custody Securely storing and managing large Bitcoin reserves requires specialized expertise and infrastructure to prevent theft or loss. Public Perception and Political Will Gaining public and political support for holding Bitcoin reserves might be challenging due to misconceptions and lack of understanding about cryptocurrency. Examples of Bitcoin Adoption and Potential Future Trends While the U.S. hasn’t officially announced strategic Bitcoin holdings , other nations and entities are already making moves in the Bitcoin space. El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender is a prominent example. MicroStrategy, a publicly traded company, has also amassed significant Bitcoin holdings as part of its corporate treasury strategy. Looking ahead, we might see: Increased Institutional Adoption: As regulatory clarity improves and institutional infrastructure matures, more corporations and investment funds could allocate capital to Bitcoin. Sovereign Wealth Funds Exploring Bitcoin: Nations with sovereign wealth funds might start considering Bitcoin as a component of their diversified investment portfolios. Central Banks Researching CBDCs and Bitcoin: Central banks are actively researching central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Simultaneously, some may explore the potential role of Bitcoin within the broader financial ecosystem. Actionable Insights: Preparing for Potential Global Bitcoin FOMO Whether or not global FOMO for Bitcoin materializes, understanding the potential implications is crucial. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments in US Bitcoin policy and global regulatory trends in the cryptocurrency space. Educate Yourself: Learn about Bitcoin’s fundamentals, technology, and economic principles to make informed decisions. Consider Diversification: Explore how Bitcoin and other digital assets might fit into a diversified investment portfolio, considering your risk tolerance and financial goals. Engage in Dialogue: Participate in discussions about Bitcoin policy and its societal impact to contribute to a more informed and balanced public discourse. Conclusion: The Dawning Era of Strategic Bitcoin? Matthew Pines’s assertion about US Bitcoin reserves triggering global FOMO is a provocative yet plausible scenario. As the world grapples with evolving financial systems and geopolitical uncertainties, Bitcoin’s role is becoming increasingly significant. Whether nations rush into strategic Bitcoin holdings remains to be seen, but the conversation is undoubtedly shifting. The Bitcoin Policy Institute and similar organizations are playing a crucial role in shaping this narrative, urging for informed and strategic approaches to Bitcoin policy. The potential for global FOMO serves as a stark reminder of Bitcoin’s growing influence and the urgent need for understanding its implications on a global scale.

In a recent post on March 7, Carter praises Trump’s decision to create a Strategic Bitcoin ( BTC ) Reserve, saying the announcement “couldn’t have gone better.” Carter, known for his investigative articles exposing the Biden administration for their efforts to snuff out the crypto industry, highlighted a few positive things that he believes came out of the White House Crypto Summit held on March 7. According to Carter, it was a good move on the Trump administration’s part to clearly set the strategic Bitcoin reserve apart from the altcoin stockpile rather than merging the two together or treating them the same way. Meanwhile, he suspects the decision to buy other altcoins will be left to the Congress. “Bitcoin gets official USG [U.S. government] seal of approval, no other coin does,” Carter explained. Instead of going up after Trump’s Bitcoin Strategic Reserve reveal, the asset has actually gone further down. At press time, Bitcoin has fallen by nearly 4% in the past 24 hours of trading. BTC has slipped well below the $90,000 threshold, dangling just under $89,000. It is currently trading hands at $88,362.

Echoing the words of AI and crypto czar David Sacks’ announcement after the White House Crypto Summit, Carter said not using taxpayer funds means there won’t be public backlash towards the reserve. In a separate post , he jokingly suggested that if Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto turns out to be someone from the National Security Agency and he has around 1 million BTC kept in Fort Meade, then Trump’s executive order would make sure those funds are never sold. After the White House Crypto Summit on March 7, David Sacks declared that President Trump has signed an executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. According to Sacks, the U.S. government currently holds around 200,000 BTC in seized assets, though a full audit has not been conducted.

However, after President Donald Trump announced changes to the proposed crypto strategic reserve, speculation is rife over whether this summit will crash Ripple, Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana prices. With the crypto market already showing signs of weakness, traders should expect more volatility. Here’s why: Why Ripple, Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana Prices Could Crash After the Crypto Summit The highly anticipated White House crypto summit is happening today, and crypto prices are crashing. Ethereum dropped by 6% to trade at $2,170 at press time. XRP price also recorded a marginal 1.3% drop to trade at $2.51, while Solana dipped by nearly 5% to $143. Cardano price saw the second-biggest losses among the top ten largest cryptos with a 7% loss to trade at $0.87. The four altcoins saw a brief rally earlier this week after they were included in President Trump’s plan for a crypto reserve. However, a recent change of plans shows that the US government is not willing to buy any of these altcoins. In a recent statement, the White House said that the government will establish a separate Bitcoin strategic reserve and a separate digital assets stockpile that will include XRP, ETH, ADA and SOL. However, the government will not buy any coins for this stockpile. Instead, it will include only seized assets. Digital Assets Stockpile If Trump does not outline clear plans on how this digital assets stockpile will be constituted, it could crash prices after the crypto summit. Bitcoin Reserve News Already Priced In Ethereum, XRP, Cardano, and Solana prices will also likely crash after the summit as the news of a Bitcoin reserve has already been priced in. These altcoins have been tracking BTC price, and if Bitcoin fails to make strong gains, altcoins could trade lower after the crypto sumit. Moreover, crypto prices are unlikely to rally after this summit due to a lack of plans to buy BTC for the strategic reserve. Crypto czar David Sacks stated that the US government holds nearly 200,000 BTC seized by law enforcement agencies, which will be included in the reserve. However, there are no clear plans on how to fund additional reserves. Bitcoin Strategic Reserve As Bitcoin price continues to struggle, it is likely that top US altcoins will also crash after this crypto summit. However, as traders close their positions and market expectations reduce. It could lead to a more natural price action. Cardano Price Crashes as Hoskinson Likely to Miss Crypto Summit According to crypto reporter Laura Shin, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has not been invited to the White House Crypto Summit. This has led to a bearish Cardano price forecast after ADA posted the biggest loss among the other four cryptos that are part of the digital assets stockpile. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is attending the summit . However, besides Hoskinson, Ethereum and Solana co-founders Vitalik Buterin and Anatoly Yakovenko have so far not been included. This could see crypto prices crashing after the summit. What’s Next for Ripple, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano Prices? Ripple, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano prices are likely to crash after the crypto summit. This is becayse market expectations that the US government will buy these altcoins for a crypto reserve are dropping. However, Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett has hinted at possible changes to crypto tax laws . She noted that during the crypto summit, there could be “some kind of tax announcement.” This could fuel gains for XRP, ETH, SOL, and ADA prices.

High-profile founders or leaders can find themselves at the center of the community’s attention, for better or worse. And how closely community members pay attention to these figures can often serve as a good proxy for how close the community is paying attention to the markets themselves. Take the chart above, for instance. It details the all-time mentions of various crypto founders across a variety of platforms, from X (formerly Twitter) to Bitcointalk. And while you might not find a direct line between mentions and actual price movements, it’s definitely the case that the more these figures get talked about (for good reasons or bad), the label “cryptocurrency” starts operating much like an “Internet stock” from 1999. The Founders Who Dominate Social Media Conversations The chart draws attention to the 10 crypto founders who receive the most mentions. Each of these individuals has had a pronounced effect on the cryptocurrency market, with some making technological advancements that seem almost miraculous, while with others, well, they’re just in the news a lot, for reasons that are not always flattering. 1. Satoshi Nakamoto: Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic and nameless creator of Bitcoin, is at the top of the crypto community’s list of luminaries. The founder of the first blockchain-based currency is, in my estimation, the most important figure in the cryptocurrency universe today even if—perhaps especially if—he’s not taking calls. Nakamoto’s handiwork (if we may assume that it is handiwork) is on display (even if virtually now) whenever the Bitcoin scene blows up. His name is the top-name driving Bitcoin-related optimism and FOMO whenever new Bitcoin- or blockchain-related innovations see the light of day. 2. Do Kwon: Co-founding Terra (LUNA) and UST with a character like Do Kwon makes it clear that there are people in this space with highly controversial tendencies. Kwon has often been debated in the community, especially following the 2022 collapse of Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin. Billions in funds that investors had poured into Terra seemed to vanish overnight, and many pointed fingers at Kwon for the disaster. Condemnation of Kwon’s character isn’t ever far off from the sentiment of this community, and depending on which side of the finger pointing one hears, mentions of Kwon can lead to some volatility. 3. Vitalik Buterin: One of the most revered personas in the crypto world, Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum and the mastermind behind the smart contracts on which its decentralized financial system operates, is a regular mention in conversations about decentralized finance (DeFi) systems, NFTs, and upgrades to the Ethereum network. When he speaks or shares news about the platform he’s helped build, it’s generally regarded in the market as a positive thing that tends to push prices upward. 4. Justin Sun: A flashily marketed persona known for penny auctions, high-profile partnerships, and mega-million dollar stunts that beg comparison to P.T. Barnum, as in: who really is Justin Sun? He is likely to make headlines from time to time, for good or ill, which will, in turn, color the perception of Tron and its currency. If you are Tron-aware, and if you have considered the antics of Sun and his affiliate, then you have a handle on this variable. Bumping up Tron’s visibility in your alt-list makes it a more speculative investment. 5. Sam Bankman-Fried: The fall of Sam Bankman-Fried, the ex-CEO of FTX, has left a long scar on the crypto world. His exchange’s implosion in 2022, resulting in criminal charges and an ongoing financial scandal, is still the talk of social media. Bankman-Fried gets mentioned a lot when fresh developments occur in his legal circumstance or when the FTX collapse’s ripple effect hits something else in the market. You could say he symbolizes the negative side of an overly fast-paced and underregulated crypto world. His name is very often associated with talk of market dips, especially when those dips are blamed on FUD. 6. Roger Ver: An early investor in Bitcoin and the principal backer of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Roger Ver is known for his clear and pointed views about Bitcoin’s scalability problem. With the ongoing support that Ver gives to Bitcoin Cash and its larger block sizes, you would think that he was trying to create and maintain a controversy in order to garner attention for BCH. Ver’s pro-scaling Bitcoin Cash and anti-scaling Bitcoin Cash puts the BCH community hot on the trail of accusations concerning building a tunnel for BCH to march down. 7. Ryoshi: The elusive founder of Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ryoshi, who passed into the mist of anonymity after launching one of the most successful meme coins of all time, still holds a prominent place in crypto legend. Of course, SHIB’s many pumps and the rabid community that supports it often keep Ryoshi’s name on people’s lips. When bursts of FOMO hit the project, it’s usually because the community has just pushed it to another all-time high, which often happens in 2022 during meme coin market rallies. 8. Charles Hoskinson: Co-founding Ethereum and creating Cardano (ADA) make Charles Hoskinson one of the major forces behind blockchain technology. For a long time now, he has been pushing for a kind of development he calls “scalability”—those changes to blockchain architecture that allow it to grow and serve more users without being slowed down in its fundamental operations. His name comes up quite a bit in discussions of various solutions for achieving that end and of the endowments of delegated autonomy they confer upon users (decentralized governance). 9. Charlie Lee: Litecoin (LTC) developer Charlie Lee remains a crucial figure in the cryptocurrency scene. His work on Litecoin, a faster and more efficient alternative to Bitcoin, means he is name-checked in any number of discussions about technical advancements or new partnerships in the space. Lee often bubbles up to the surface during the periods of interest that alternative cryptocurrencies can generate—interest that sometimes contributes to price movements for LTC. 10. Changpeng Zhao: The largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, Binance, was founded by Changpeng Zhao. Zhao has played a vital part in molding the global crypto market. He is an executive who is frequently mentioned in the news—obviously, not all publicity is good; some of it pertains to how problematic Binance can be or how liable it is to regulators or other aspects of the law. Still, most of the news is either okay or very good, and that is a huge part of the crypto market. The following chart indicates the all-time mentions of relevant crypto founders according to discussion frequency on X, Reddit, Telegram, 4Chan, Farcaster, and Bitcointalk. These are the top 10: 1⃣ Satoshi Nakamoto: The mysterious figure behind Bitcoin, credited with writing… pic.twitter.com/BHt9fEFwAt — Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 5, 2025 The Impact of Founder Mentions on Market Sentiment The chart spotlights not just the names that dominate crypto chats, but also the market’s hypersensitivity to those names. When certain people are trending, the crypto conversation not just pauses, but also pivots. And this chat ain’t in a bubble, because when it kinda seems like certain people’s names are about to fall off the trending charts and into obscurity, that’s when the market actually reacts, in this case, negatively. Comprehending these trends is very important for investors. They can furnish highly valuable revelations into the way social media dialogues and the public’s perception of these important personages can affect price movements and general market volatility.

Crypto asset manager had previously submitted an S-1 registration statement to the SEC for a spot Polkadot ETF on Jan. 31. The March filing is an updated version of that initial application, possibly to address feedback from the SEC or to provide additional information. The filing sees 21Shares join Grayscale, which filed to list a spot Polkadot ETF with the SEC on Feb. 25 through Nasdaq . The Polkadot ETF filings by 21Shares and Grayscale are part of a broader trend where asset managers are increasingly seeking SEC approval for crypto ETFs. 21Shares has also recently filed for ETFs targeting Ripple ( XRP ) and Solana ( SOL ). As for its existing offerings, 21Shares currently offers Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) ETFs, as well as a number of exchange-traded products . You might also like: Polkadot price stuck at a key support, pointing to a 170% surge Meanwhile, DOT price appears to have formed a falling wedge pattern on the weekly chart, a bullish reversal setup characterized by lower highs and lower lows converging into a narrowing range. In other words, the distance between highs and lows is decreasing, which means that the rate of decline is slowing. This suggests that sellers are losing momentum, and a breakout could be imminent. If DOT breaks above the local resistance zone of around $10, it would confirm the wedge breakout. The critical support level is around $4, which if crossed, will invalidate the pattern, potentially driving DOT back to the previous major support at $3.60. At press time, DOT is trading at around $4.5, with the 24-hour volume of over $255 million, according to Coinmarketcap . Source: crypto.news In addition to the potential approval of Polkadot ETF by the SEC, DOT price may be buoyed by the launch of Polkadot 2.0 in Q1 of this year, a major upcoming upgrade to the Polkadot network designed to enhance its scalability and developer accessibility. An early testnet version is already available on the Kusama network, allowing developers and users to experience and provide feedback on the new features before the official release.

In a new video, the trader pseudonymously known as DonAlt tells 65,900 subscribers of the TechnicalRoundup YouTube channel that he has not changed his bullish bias on Bitcoin and is still “expecting higher” prices for the flagship crypto asset. “Trend still strong though… [On the weekly time frame] last week, [Bitcoin] wiped below the range and then closed all the way back in it. This is bullish – like that’s a really good close. And then we had this week, we had another wipeout. And so far, that’s kind of been reclaimed as well. So, if this weekly close is above $90,000, I’m going to assume the range is still intact. And given we tested the bottom of the range, wiped out everyone below it, that would be like a bullish setup.” Source: DonAlt/YouTube According to DonAlt, Bitcoin will go much higher if it rallies above the range high of $104,000. The pseudonymous analyst, however, says that Bitcoin appears bearish on the daily and monthly time frame. “Monthly [chart] is not that great… And daily [chart] is really, really interesting here because technically speaking, there’s an excellent short setup here. So basically, you would take a short here [around $90,000], your stops up here [around $95,000]. And then you target like new lows. Like either this [around $78,000] or even like all the way back to $70,000. Like that’s a really good short setup.” Source: DonAlt/YouTube Bitcoin is trading at $87,508 at time of writing.

Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts, because a significant development just dropped. Canary Capital, a well-known crypto investment firm, has taken a major leap by registering an entity for a spot SUI ETF in Delaware, United States. This news, initially reported by BWE News Telegram channel, is sending ripples of anticipation throughout the digital asset community. But what exactly does this mean, and why is it such a big deal for SUI and the broader crypto market? Let’s dive in and explore this fascinating development. What’s the Buzz About a Spot SUI ETF? Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have revolutionized traditional investing, offering a simple and regulated way for investors to gain exposure to various asset classes. In the crypto world, the idea of a Crypto ETF has been a long-sought goal, promising to bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets. A spot ETF is particularly noteworthy because it directly holds the underlying asset – in this case, SUI. Unlike futures-based ETFs which track futures contracts, a spot ETF directly reflects the actual price movements of SUI. This is generally seen as more desirable by investors as it provides more direct and transparent exposure to the cryptocurrency. Think of it this way: Direct Exposure: A spot SUI ETF would allow investors to invest in SUI without directly holding the cryptocurrency themselves. This simplifies the process, eliminating the need for crypto wallets, private keys, and navigating complex exchanges. Regulation and Security: ETFs are regulated financial products, offering a layer of security and investor protection that may be lacking in the often-unregulated crypto space. This could attract institutional investors and those who are hesitant to dive directly into crypto due to security concerns. Accessibility: ETFs are easily accessible through traditional brokerage accounts. This makes investing in SUI as simple as buying stocks, opening up the market to a much wider range of investors who are already comfortable with traditional investment vehicles. Canary Capital Leading the Charge for SUI ETF Canary Capital , the firm behind this exciting move, is not new to the crypto investment landscape. They are known for their strategic investments and forward-thinking approach to digital assets. Their decision to register a spot SUI ETF entity in Delaware signals a strong belief in the potential of SUI and the growing demand for regulated crypto investment products. Delaware is a popular jurisdiction for business registrations due to its business-friendly legal framework, which further adds credibility to Canary Capital’s endeavor. [img src=”image-of-canary-capital-and-sui-logo.jpg” alt=”Canary Capital and SUI Logo”] Why is Canary Capital ‘s involvement significant? Expertise and Reputation: Canary Capital’s established presence in the crypto investment sector lends weight to the SUI ETF application. Their expertise and reputation can instill confidence in both regulators and potential investors. Strategic Vision: Filing for a spot SUI ETF demonstrates Canary Capital’s strategic vision and their anticipation of the evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies. They are positioning themselves at the forefront of institutional crypto adoption. Market Impact: A successful SUI ETF launched by Canary Capital could significantly boost the visibility and credibility of SUI, potentially driving further investment and adoption of the SUI network. The Significance of a Spot ETF in the Digital Asset Realm The registration of a spot SUI ETF entity is more than just news for SUI enthusiasts; it’s a significant moment for the entire digital asset investment space. The crypto industry has been eagerly awaiting the approval of spot crypto ETFs in the U.S. for years. While Bitcoin spot ETFs have finally been approved, the expansion to other cryptocurrencies like SUI marks the next phase of crypto’s integration into mainstream finance. Here’s why spot ETFs are crucial for the digital asset market: Feature Spot ETF Futures ETF Underlying Asset Directly holds the cryptocurrency (SUI) Holds futures contracts of the cryptocurrency Price Tracking Directly reflects spot price of SUI Tracks futures price, which can deviate from spot price Investor Appeal Generally preferred for direct exposure and transparency May be less appealing due to indirect exposure and potential tracking errors Market Maturity Signal Stronger signal of market maturity and regulatory acceptance Step towards maturity, but spot ETFs are considered the ultimate goal The Road Ahead for the SUI ETF and Crypto ETFs While the registration of the entity is a positive first step, it’s important to remember that the journey to launching a spot SUI ETF is still in its early stages. The application process with regulatory bodies like the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) can be lengthy and complex. There are several hurdles to overcome, including regulatory approvals, custody solutions, and market surveillance requirements. Challenges and Considerations: Regulatory Scrutiny: The SEC has been cautious in approving crypto ETFs. Canary Capital will need to demonstrate robust compliance measures and address any regulatory concerns to gain approval for their SUI ETF . Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market remains a concern for regulators. Measures to mitigate risks and protect investors will be crucial. Custody Solutions: Secure and reliable custody of the underlying SUI tokens is essential for a spot ETF. Canary Capital will need to partner with established custodians to ensure the safety of assets. What Does This Mean for You and the Crypto Market? The potential launch of a spot SUI ETF is undoubtedly exciting news for the SUI community and the broader crypto ecosystem. It represents a significant step towards mainstream adoption and could have several positive implications: Increased Demand for SUI: A SUI ETF could drive significant demand for SUI as ETF providers need to acquire the underlying tokens to back the ETF shares. Enhanced Market Liquidity: Increased trading activity related to the ETF could improve liquidity in the SUI market. Broader Investor Base: A SUI ETF would open up SUI investment to a wider range of investors, including institutional investors and retail investors who prefer regulated investment products. Validation of SUI and Crypto: The approval of a SUI ETF would further validate SUI as a legitimate digital asset and reinforce the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies within the traditional financial system. Conclusion: A Promising Horizon for SUI and Crypto ETFs Canary Capital ‘s registration of a spot SUI ETF entity is a landmark development that underscores the growing maturity of the cryptocurrency market. While the path to launch may have its challenges, this move signals a strong belief in the future of SUI and the transformative potential of crypto ETFs. As we move forward, the crypto world will be watching closely to see how this exciting journey unfolds. The potential for a spot SUI ETF to unlock new avenues for investment and accelerate mainstream adoption is immense, promising a brighter and more accessible future for digital asset investment .

The EO establishes two main components: a strategic reserve dedicated to Bitcoin and a broader digital asset stockpile that includes other cryptocurrencies. Among the assets considered for this stockpile are XRP, SOL, ADA, and ETH. In the wake of these developments, Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko has expressed concerns about the creation of such a reserve, especially regarding its potential impact on decentralization. Yakovenko recently addressed rumors suggesting that Ripple may have pitched SOL as part of the national reserve in a bid to make the inclusion of XRP more legitimate. Responding to these claims, Yakovenko clarified his position on reserves, stating his preference: No Reserve : “If you want decentralization to fail, you’d put the government in charge of it.” State-Controlled Reserves : He suggested that individual states should run their own reserves to act as a hedge against potential federal mistakes. Objective Criteria for Reserves : If a reserve is necessary, Yakovenko argues it should be based on objective, measurable requirements that are rationally justified. Yakovenko further stressed that the Solana ecosystem would be ready to meet any objective criteria set by a reserve, even if it means focusing on Bitcoin for now. When questioned about whether Solana representatives had pitched SOL for inclusion in the reserve while Ripple pushed for XRP’s inclusion, Yakovenko humorously responded, “What’s a Solana representative? At this point, it’s honestly like saying a Bitcoin representative. No one asked me, and I didn’t pitch it.”",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,SOL|FIAT|BTC|XRP|ETH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-07 08:11:14

Republicans have raised concerns about this issue in recent congressional hearings, highlighting how, in the past, crypto businesses were often excluded from banking services because regulators like the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC didn’t want them in the system, fearing negative consequences for the banks’ reputations. Tim Scott’s FIRM Act To Protect Crypto Tim Scott, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has gathered support from fellow Republicans for the Financial Integrity and Regulation Management Act (FIRM Act). Essentially, the bill would prevent regulators from considering a bank’s reputation as a factor in determining whether it is safe and sound to do business with certain customers, like those in the crypto industry. “It’s clear that federal regulators have abused reputational risk by carrying out a political agenda against federally legal businesses. This legislation, which eliminates all references to reputational risk in regulatory supervision, is the first step in ending debanking once and for all,” said Chairman Scott. Scott was joined on the bill by his fellow Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee, including Sen. Cynthia Lummis. Lummis, who chairs the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets, believes that the U.S. needs clear and transparent rules that support the growth of digital assets (like cryptocurrency) rather than restrict them with excessive government control. “We’re putting these rogue regulators on notice—their days of unchecked power are over,” she added in a statement. “Financial regulators have used ‘reputational risk’ to target people and businesses they don’t like, hiding behind this open-ended and subjective concept,” said Senator Tillis. “The FIRM Act stops this political weaponization and ensures regulators focus on real financial risks, not personal or political agendas. Crypto has found a strong ally in the GOP, especially with President Trump supporting the industry. Trump has also criticized banks for refusing to work with conservatives, adding fuel to the debanking debate.",Uncategorized|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,REGULATION|FIAT|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-07 08:12:28

How naming rights could fund the Fed’s strategic Bitcoin reserve,https://crypto.news/naming-rights-could-fund-strategic-bitcoin-reserve/,"Auctioning off naming rights to national landmarks offers a proactive, budget-neutral boost, echoing President Trump’s call to harness digital assets for American prosperity. On March 6, 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order establishing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, a decisive step to make America the “crypto capital of the world,” as outlined in the White House Fact Sheet released today. By designating Bitcoin ( BTC ) a reserve asset — initially funded with 88,000 BTC of forfeited holdings — the order charges the Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce with crafting budget-neutral strategies to acquire more, a move the U.S. deems necessary in its quest for global cryptocurrency dominance. Here’s the text of the Executive Order: ESTABLISHMENT OF THE STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE AND UNITED STATES DIGITAL ASSET STOCKPILE March 6, 2025 https://t.co/sQXmaW0X11 — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) March 7, 2025 Enter an audacious yet practical idea: auctioning the naming rights to America’s natural wonders. Picture a “Tether Falls” cascading in Yellowstone, “Lake Binance” lapping where Michigan once stood, or the “Bitfinex Smoky Mountains” rising in Tennessee. This is not mere whimsy — it’s a market-driven path to amass Bitcoin, fulfilling the President’s vision with flair and fiscal discipline. It is a blueprint that exists in sports. Naming rights have long turned stadiums into cash cows without diluting their purpose. The New York Mets’ 20-year, $400 million deal for Citi Field, initiated in 2009, remains the most significant, but the San Francisco Giants’ 2019 contract with Oracle Park is estimated to have an average annual value of $15 million. Additionally, the Texas Rangers’ deal for Globe Life Field in 2017 and the Houston Astros’ agreement for Daikin Park in 2024 are both believed to be generating at least $11 million annually. If corporations pay top dollar to brand a ballpark or football stadium, why not a waterfall, national park, lake or forest? The White House’s mandate for cost-free innovation makes this a natural fit — transforming public landmarks into Bitcoin-neutral acquisition strategies outlined by the latest Executive Order. You might also like: Trump signs executive order establishing a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Why stop at stadiums when America’s wild expanses beckon? Turn the Grand Canyon into the “Pump.fun Grand Abyss,” and crypto traders might bid a king’s ransom to see their favorite memecoin rebranded in Google maps. Rechristen Mount Rainier as “Robinhood Rainier” and watch blockchain pioneers scramble to claim its snowy crown. Even the Florida Keys could jangle as the “Chainlink Keys,” the Niagara Falls as “Pwease Falls”, alluring digital asset firms to splash digital gold on a tropical rebrand. These aren’t timid tweaks — they’re loud, proud crypto billboards, turning nature into a Bitcoin honeypot, all the while keeping taxpayers off the hook. The numbers could be extraordinary. Suppose the renaming of Niagara Falls fetches $500 million over a century — a plausible sum given stadium precedents — and 50 other landmarks (lakes, national parks, ranges, rivers, gorges) average $100 million each. That’s $5.5 billion. At Bitcoin’s current price of $90,000 per coin as of March 2025, this yields roughly 61,111 BTC. Push the envelope with blockbuster assets — say, the Gulf of Coinbase instead of the recently rebranded Gulf of America, or the “Gemini Grand Canyon” hitting $1 billion each — and the total could near 100,000 BTC over 100 years. These aren’t one-offs; re-auctioning every century, adjusted for inflation and Bitcoin’s trajectory, ensures a steady stream, aligning with the Executive Order’s long-term vision. Critics might clutch their pearls at “Coinbase Falls,” decrying the loss of solemnity. But Fenway Park’s charm survives its branded roots, and Wrigley Field thrives despite its gum-inspired name. Public taste adapts — Crypto.com Arena’s rise in Los Angeles shows how fast acceptance follows audacity. Better yet, the windfall could fund conservation efforts, helping to minimize the burden of its $3 billion dollar annual budget for the U.S. National Park Service , all in the spirit of the Department of Government Efficiency , in addition to the newly signed Executive Order. The stakes could not be higher. The Fact Sheet laments $17 billion lost to premature Bitcoin sales, a lesson in the cost of inertia. With 21 million coins fixed forever, Bitcoin’s “digital gold” status demands action. The Executive Order centralizes forfeited holdings, but seizures alone won’t scale a world-leading reserve. Nor will adding to the Fed’s Bitcoin coffers while taking on additional government debt, which already stands at $36 trillion dollars (and counting). Hence, naming rights offer a proactive, budget-neutral boost, echoing President Trump’s call to harness digital assets for prosperity without burdening the American public with additional debt. Selling Maine, Vermont & Massachusetts to buy Bitcoin is budget neutral. — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) March 7, 2025 Implementation needs grit. Auctions must be open and fierce, inviting bids from Coinbase to obscure meme-coin startups. No need for restraint — let “Polkadot Pikes Peak” or “XRP Yosemite” fly if the price is right. The Treasury could time Bitcoin buys to dodge volatility, as the Fact Sheet allows for savvy stewardship. This isn’t about defacing nature — it’s about seizing a moment. Lake Michigan will still shimmer; the Mississippi River will still roar. The real prize is a bussin’ Bitcoin reserve, built without fiscal strain, proving America can lead the crypto charge with creativity and swagger. Whatever it takes, please.

It might sound like a niche issue, but a new analysis suggests that where candidates stand on digital assets could significantly influence the ballot box. Let’s dive into how Stand With Crypto , a prominent digital asset advocacy group, is highlighting the growing power of crypto voters in the Garden State and what it could mean for the 2025 race. Why are Crypto Voters a Decisive Force in the New Jersey Election? It’s no secret that cryptocurrency has moved from the fringes of the internet to mainstream conversations. But are crypto enthusiasts a voting bloc to be reckoned with? According to Cointelegraph , Stand With Crypto believes so, especially in New Jersey. Their recent report indicates that around 62,000 individuals in New Jersey have joined their organization. Sixty-two thousand might seem like a drop in the ocean in a statewide election, but in closely contested races, such numbers can be incredibly impactful. Think of it as a highly motivated and potentially swingable voting segment. Here’s why this is noteworthy: Concentrated Interest: These 62,000 individuals are not just casually interested in crypto; they’ve actively joined an advocacy group. This suggests a high level of engagement and a willingness to vote based on crypto-related issues. Swing Voter Potential: The survey data reveals a nuanced picture. While 63% favor pro-crypto candidates, a significant 17% would actively vote against anti-crypto candidates. This indicates a strong negative incentive that could sway voting decisions. Beyond Demographics: Cryptocurrency adoption isn’t limited to a specific age group or political affiliation. It spans across demographics, potentially making this voting bloc influential across different segments of the electorate. Stand With Crypto: Amplifying Voter Influence in the Gubernatorial Race Stand With Crypto isn’t just counting numbers; they’re actively working to ensure that candidates understand the importance of digital assets to their constituents. Their analysis isn’t just about raw figures; it’s about understanding voter sentiment. The February survey of 400 members provides valuable insights into the mindset of these crypto voters . Let’s break down the key findings from their survey: Preference Percentage Favor pro-crypto candidates 63% Will not vote for anti-crypto candidates 17% Undecided or neutral 20% These numbers aren’t just statistics; they are a message to gubernatorial hopefuls. Ignoring the crypto community in New Jersey might come at a political cost. Candidates who proactively engage with this demographic and articulate clear stances on digital asset policy could gain a significant edge. Conversely, those who dismiss or oppose cryptocurrency might alienate a sizable and motivated portion of the electorate. How Could Voter Influence Manifest in the Election? So, how exactly could this voter influence play out in the New Jersey gubernatorial race? It’s not just about candidates making vague statements about “innovation.” Crypto voters are likely to be looking for concrete positions on specific issues. Here are a few potential areas where candidate stances on cryptocurrency could matter: Regulatory Clarity: Voters may want to know where candidates stand on state-level regulations for cryptocurrency businesses and activities. Do they favor a welcoming regulatory environment or stricter controls? Taxation of Digital Assets: Tax policies related to cryptocurrency are a significant concern for holders. Candidates’ views on taxing crypto gains and transactions will be closely scrutinized. Cryptocurrency Adoption by the State: Some voters might be interested in seeing the state government itself adopt or explore cryptocurrency for various applications, such as payments or record-keeping. Consumer Protection: Ensuring consumer protection in the crypto space is crucial. Candidates might be asked about their plans to safeguard investors and users from fraud and scams. Blockchain Technology Initiatives: Beyond cryptocurrency, blockchain technology has broader applications. Candidates could be asked about their vision for leveraging blockchain for state services or economic development. Navigating the Gubernatorial Race: Actionable Insights for Candidates and Crypto Voters For candidates vying for the governorship, the message is clear: understanding and addressing the concerns of crypto voters is no longer optional – it’s strategic. Here are some actionable insights: For Candidates: Educate Yourself: Familiarize yourself with the basics of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Understand the key issues and concerns within the crypto community. Engage with the Community: Reach out to crypto advocacy groups and individuals in New Jersey. Listen to their perspectives and concerns. Articulate a Clear Stance: Don’t be vague. Develop clear and well-reasoned positions on crypto-related issues. Explain your approach to regulation, innovation, and consumer protection. Highlight Potential Benefits: Frame your crypto policy in terms of economic opportunity, innovation, and job creation. Show how a pro-crypto stance can benefit New Jersey. For Crypto Voters: Stay Informed: Research candidates’ positions on cryptocurrency. Don’t rely on assumptions or generalizations. Make Your Voice Heard: Contact candidates and their campaigns. Ask them direct questions about their crypto policies. Organize and Mobilize: Work with groups like Stand With Crypto to amplify your collective voice. Encourage fellow crypto enthusiasts to register and vote. Vote Strategically: Consider candidates’ overall platforms, but weigh their crypto stance as a significant factor in your decision. The Crucial Role of Crypto Voters in Shaping New Jersey’s Future The 2025 New Jersey gubernatorial election is shaping up to be more than just a traditional political contest. The emergence of crypto voters as a potentially decisive force adds a new dimension to the race. Candidates who recognize this shift and engage thoughtfully with the crypto community may find themselves with a significant advantage. For crypto enthusiasts in New Jersey, this election presents an opportunity to make their voices heard and influence the future direction of the state’s digital asset policies. The message is clear: crypto is no longer a fringe topic; it’s a political issue with real-world electoral consequences.

Binance Puts Tracking Tag on GoPlus Security (GPS) Amid Market Manipulation Concerns According to Binance, this decision was made due to significant price declines immediately after GPS was listed on the exchange and concerns regarding the market-making behavior of one of GPS’s designated market makers. The exchange cited the following irregularities: 70 million GPS tokens were sold by the market maker between 16:00 on March 4 and 12:55 on March 5 No purchase order was placed by the market maker during this period. The market maker continuously sold GPS tokens immediately after spot trading opened Market maker became the biggest profiteer, earning around 5 million USDT In response, Binance has temporarily suspended the market maker’s account and is conducting an in-depth investigation into the matter. What Does the Tracking Label Mean? Tokens with a Watch Label are considered highly volatile and risky, and Binance requires users to pass a test every 90 days before trading. The quiz is designed to ensure that investors understand the risks associated with these tokens. Tokens marked with a Watch Label may also be at risk of being delisted if they fail to meet Binance’s listing criteria. Binance stated that it will conduct regular reviews of GPS and other tagged tokens based on the following factors: Commitment of the project team Development activity Trading volume and liquidity Network security and stability Public communication Binance's response to due diligence requests Evidence of unethical or fraudulent behavior Overall contribution to the crypto ecosystem Binance assured users that it will continue to monitor GPS closely and take necessary action based on the latest findings. *This is not investment advice.

Notably, the attorney called out reasons why the U.S. Bitcoin reserve could potentially lose value against the ‘crypto stockpile’ moving ahead. This conjecture primarily rides on the back of a scenario wherein altcoins outperform BTC. Pro-XRP Lawyer Rationalizes Why Bitcoin Reserve Could Depreciate Against Crypto Stockpile XRP lawyer Bill Morgan revealed in an X post on March 7 that the setback lies in a case that assets within the crypto stockpile outperform BTC. “The market won’t care about what asset is in the strategic reserve,” the attorney added, even if it is the flagship crypto. Historically, the market has sought value and will continue doing so, buying better assets and thus presenting risk to Bitcoin. Morgan further sparked market speculations by saying, ‘There will be an inherent risk of the Bitcoin strategic reserve losing value against the non-BTC market and US crypto stockpile,” given altcoins outperform. America’s BTC Reserve-Only Approach: A Boon Or Curse? The attorney highlighted that if the U.S. crypto stockpile is not increased by budget-neutral acquisition despite its assets outperforming BTC, other countries with a broader approach toward crypto reserves could leverage substantially. Given that this saga happens, the U.S. may constantly need to take action to protect its BTC-only reserve. In turn, the flagship coin could see further advantages in the American market. “A form of market protectionism,” the pro-XRP lawyer added, sparking market speculations. “Where would that leave a free crypto market with a level playing field?” Morgan concluded by questioning David Sacks, America’s Crypto Czar. US Strategic Reserve & Crypto Stockpile: Here’s All To Know Notably, U.S. President Donald Trump recently signed a Bitcoin Executive order to establish a BTC strategic reserve. America’s latest BTC reserve will contain roughly 200,000 coins that are already in the government’s possession. These coins have been seized over the years as a result of crackdown on criminal and illicit activities. Besides, David Sacks recently revealed that Scott Bessent and Howard Lutnick have been appointed to tap into more resources to acquire additional BTC for reserve purposes. This avenue is taken to achieve a feat that avoids taxpayer money. On the other hand, the crypto stockpile will encompass assets like XRP, ADA, ETH, and SOL. However, the key difference between the reserve and stockpile remains in upsizing them. While more ways to acquire BTC for the U.S. reserve are in the pipeline, the govt. will not actively look for ways to purchase more assets in the stockpile.

Top Analyst Says a Big Move Is Coming!,https://coinpedia.org/news/litecoin-price-to-crash-or-recover-top-analyst-says-a-big-move-is-coming/,"The post Litecoin Price To Crash or Recover? Top Analyst Says a Big Move Is Coming! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Litecoin (LTC) was one of the few altcoins that exhibited price dominance against BTC and outperformance against major crypto assets, LTC price dropped as low as $95, reflecting a 15% drop in a week. Despite the drop, crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggests that (the MVRV) ratio hints toward a bullish recovery. MVRV Ratio Hints Bullish Signals According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the MVRV indicator signals that LTC remains in a healthy position despite recent market fluctuations. The MVRV ratio is a key metric that helps traders assess whether an asset is overvalued or undervalued. A low MVRV suggests the asset is in an accumulation phase, while a high MVRV signals potential profit-taking from investors. #Litecoin $LTC maintains a bullish outlook as the MVRV Ratio signals strength! pic.twitter.com/Xprn0NqyXF — Ali (@ali_charts) March 7, 2025 Looking at Ali Martinez’s latest chart, Litecoin’s MVRV ratio is maintaining strength even after pullbacks to psychological support at $100. This suggests that long-term holders are staying confident, and selling pressure is relatively low. However, if this trend continues, Litecoin could be setting up for a significant move toward $108 and further to $117. Litecoin Under Pressure as Key Events Approach Litecoin’s recent drop has worried traders, especially after it was left out of the U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve. This decision has made many investors more bearish, leading to an increase in short positions. Even though some traders still hope for a Litecoin ETF approval , other major events could impact the market first. The upcoming White House summit and the U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report are expected to shape investor sentiment in the coming days. With Litecoin now trading below the important $100 level, there is a growing risk of further declines if buyers don’t step in soon. Bears Target a Drop to $85 Litecoin’s price has turned bearish after gaining momentum in February. The recent drop has pushed LTC near the lower Bollinger Band at $102.77 , indicating oversold conditions and increased volatility. If buyers fail to regain support at $100, sellers could drive the price down further to the next major support at $85, a level that has historically seen strong demand. Even, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 37.62, suggesting that Litecoin is nearing oversold territory.",News,EN,0,0,LTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-07 09:14:50

This trader has demonstrated solid faith in MUTM’s market potential by reinvesting their original $14,000 acquisition of the project just a few days later. Mutuum Finance’s presale currently operates in the second part at $0.015 and it has obtained $2.3 million from investors along with 4,300 token holders during its current phase. Current investors who purchase before MUTM lists on exchanges will achieve a 300% profit boost as the token price moves from $0.015 to $0.06. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Momentum The presale pace for Mutuum Finance continues to increase despite the forthcoming rise in price to $0.02. Customers quickly exhausted the first phase of the presale and now demand is overwhelming during the second phase release. MUTM tokens currently sell at $0.015 while the offering period shortens quickly. Those who purchase MUTM tokens during the upcoming phase will obtain a 33% gain because the price will rise from $0.015 to $0.02. Prior to reaching exchanges Mutuum Finance offers investors the possibility to earn a token value increase of 300% to the listing price of $0.06. The project obtains its success from powerful tokenomics innovations along with practical utility in the real world. Mutuum Finance delivers a decentralized loan platform that provides users opportunities to take loans and lend money together with passive income generation. Users earning revenue through the mtTokens system because these tokens accumulate interest as time passes. The useful implementation of blockchain technology in the Mutuum Finance project has attracted more than 4,300 users as demand surges. The Power of Mutuum Finance’s Lending Model Mutuum Finance stands out through its systematic lending method for creating sustained market growth and operational stability. Mutuum Finance operates through two distinct functions and allows its users to access tokenized assets by either depositing assets to liquidity pools for earning interest or borrowing assets by providing assets with extra value. The systematic model creates risk reduction and liquid asset availability which makes it a desirable option between both lenders and borrowers. Mutuum Finance includes a feature that enables users to deal with each other for loan terms through its peer-to-peer (P2P) lending system. The lending system proves especially beneficial because it allows people to get access to special assets like meme coins that conventional pools reject. Users find the platform more compelling because its purchase distribution capabilities use platform revenue to repurchase MUTM tokens and disperse them among stakers. A continuous buying environment pushes up the value of the token since it implements regular purchase activities. A Token Built for Long-Term Growth The token structure at Mutuum Finance has been strategically designed to produce enduring sustainable growth. The token allocation strategy gives first priority to liquidity mining alongside platform development and partnership investments which sustains an expansive and effective ecosystem. This distribution method urges investors to keep their tokens while simultaneously decreasing market pressure from sellers thus enforcing market equilibrium. Experts expect the MUTM value to rise up to $1.50 after its launch which creates substantial long-term return potential for early purchase investors. A $2,500 investment at $0.015 presale price could result in a total value of $150,000 by reaching $1.50 per token. The crypto market shows mixed returns but MUTM offers such exceptional returns that investors find this token highly appealing to reach financial growth objectives. An investor who won big with Bonk (BONK) shows his faith in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) through significant capital investment. MUTM shows impressive potential for development because of its inventive loan structure combined with solid token system development and thriving presale data. The second phase of the presale, priced at $0.015, offers a limited-time opportunity to secure tokens at a discount before the next price hike. As the project moves closer to its exchange listing, demand is expected to surge, making now the ideal time to invest. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this groundbreaking project—act fast before the price increases.

Analysts suggest that institutional investors will take Bitcoin more seriously, while market watchers expect big price movements as liquidity dynamics and government involvement evolve. Analysts Predict Crypto Market Recovery The total cryptocurrency market capitalization soared to a record high of $3.73 trillion on Dec. 14 of 2024, before experiencing a big 20+% decline to $2.89 trillion. Despite this pullback, some analysts are still optimistic about the market’s future trajectory, and predict a potential recovery and new all-time highs in the second quarter of 2025. Mark Quant , a crypto markets researcher, presented an analysis which suggests that the Global Liquidity Index (GLI) could be a key factor in the market’s resurgence. The GLI measures the ease of financing in global financial markets, and provides insight into global financial conditions. Historically, a rise in the GLI has been associated with increased investor access to capital, which in turn fuels demand for risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. Quant pointed to a strong 0.77 correlation between the GLI and total crypto market capitalization, with a 74-day offset, which indicates that liquidity expansions tend to precede bullish trends in the crypto market. Based on this historical relationship, he suggested that the market could move sideways for the next month before beginning an upward trajectory in early April. This could potentially push the total market capitalization beyond $4 trillion. The relationship between liquidity and crypto prices aligns with previous research , like the work of macroeconomist Lyn Alden, who found that Bitcoin historically followed global liquidity trends approximately 83% of the time over a 12-month period. Compared to other asset classes like the S&P 500, gold, and global equity indices, Bitcoin demonstrated the highest correlation with global liquidity conditions. However, Alden pointed out that short-term deviations could occur because of unique market events or internal dynamics. During the recent market decline, analysts closely monitored key support levels to determine whether a bottom is in. Dom, a market analyst, pointed out that the total market cap is currently testing significant support at its 2021 cycle high and its March 2024 peak. He also shared that the yearly relative volume-weighted average price (rVWAP) sits just below the current market level, which reinforces the idea that the market structure remains intact for now. He warned that breaking below the current monthly lows could jeopardize the bull market’s continuation. Daan Crypto , another well-known trader, believes that the outcome of the current weekly close will be a critical factor in assessing the market’s direction. As the total market cap is still under its 2021 highs, there are signs that bearish sentiment is trying to gain control over the higher time frame charts. Whether the market finds support at these levels or sees further downside remains to be seen. US Crypto Reserve Could Boost Bitcoin Market Cap An analysis by Sygnum Bank suggests that the creation of a strategic crypto reserve in the United States could drive Bitcoin’s market capitalization up by approximately 25%, adding around $460 billion in value. Donald Trump envisions a national crypto stockpile that includes Bitcoin along with other digital assets like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). Sygnum's research pointed out the potential for a major price multiplier effect, and estimates that every $1 billion of net inflows into Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) leads to a 3-6% increase in BTC’s price. Inflows vs Bitcoin price (Source: Sygnum Bank ) Katalin Tischhauser, Sygnum’s head of research, explained that Bitcoin’s liquid supply is relatively small, making it highly susceptible to upward price shocks from large inflows. She added that if federal or state governments begin purchasing Bitcoin, it will likely set off a chain reaction, encouraging institutional investors and even other governments to follow suit. The discussion around a national crypto reserve gained a lot of traction in July of 2024 when US Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced the BITCOIN Act, which is a proposal that is aimed at establishing a dedicated US Bitcoin reserve. Since then, more than half of US states entertained similar initiatives at a state level, though not all have been successful. On March 2, Trump said that he is committed to the initiative, which fueled an initial market rally that later faded as broader macroeconomic concerns and trade tensions took hold. Despite the excitement, progress on these plans has been uneven, with five states already rejecting crypto reserve proposals. Tischhauser’s prediction could very soon become a reality as President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile. The reserve will initially be funded with cryptocurrency that was seized in government criminal cases. White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks confirmed that the Bitcoin reserve will be capitalized with assets forfeited through criminal or civil proceedings. A White House fact sheet also outlined that the Digital Asset Stockpile will include cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. US Bitcoin Reserve a Turning Point for Crypto The establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the United States greatly reduces the likelihood of a government ban on Bitcoin and could accelerate adoption by other nations, according to crypto analysts. The announcement initially triggered a 6% drop in Bitcoin’s price , but many believe the market reaction may have been misplaced as the move is a long-term bullish signal. Bitcoin’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan believes that a US strategic Bitcoin reserve makes it highly unlikely that the federal government will ever ban Bitcoin. This aligns with a November 2024 report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, which suggested that Bitcoin could pressure the government to balance its budget. The move is also expected to push other nations to consider establishing their own Bitcoin reserves. The US currently leads in nation-state Bitcoin holdings with approximately 207,189 BTC worth $18 billion. The US is followed by China with 194,000 BTC and the United Kingdom with 61,000 BTC. El Salvador is the only country to have made Bitcoin legal tender and continues to accumulate. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong expects G20 nations to take note and eventually follow the US lead. Hougan also pointed out how the reserve’s creation legitimizes Bitcoin in the eyes of institutional investors, which makes it harder for organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to argue against sovereign Bitcoin holdings. The IMF previously pressured nations like El Salvador to limit their Bitcoin investments. Bitwise head of research Ryan Rasmussen revealed some of the broader implications of the US Bitcoin reserve, and believes that it removes institutional excuses for not investing in Bitcoin, as well as increases the likelihood of further state-level Bitcoin purchases. Lightspark CEO David Marcus described the move as a balanced and rational decision, while crypto lawyer John Deaton pointed out that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have been directed to explore “budget-neutral” ways to acquire more Bitcoin.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|FIAT|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-07 09:19:07

Kweon Seong-dong, floor leader of the People Power Party (PPP), addressed during a meeting with government officials and heads of local cryptocurrency exchanges at the National Assembly in Seoul, March 7. Korean Government to ‘Review’ Global Trends on Crypto ETFs Per local reports , he stressed the need for “system improvements” to develop the crypto assets market. He added that the authorities will “review” these products and their trends worldwide, before implementing them. “The government and the PPP will review global trends before considering the approval of the spot crypto ETFs, taking infrastructure and regulatory framework into account,” he told reporters Friday. Further, Seong-dong emphasized that policies that consider “both user protection and market development,” are inevitable, given soaring crypto trading volume. According to Bloomberg , from last Nov. 5-28, the daily average trading on Korean crypto exchanges amounted to about $9.4 billion. At the time, crypto trading was much bigger than the Korea Composite Stock Price Index or KOSPI at $7 billion.

The regulator, however, expressed a cautionary approach to cryptos and in particular, BTC ETFs. Recently, Korea Financial Investment Association Chairman Seo Yoo-seok highlighted that the nation has to embrace cryptocurrency ETFs to not lag behind global markets. “While the virtual asset market is projected to continue its expansion, Korea should not be left out,” he noted. Further, some South Korean financial chiefs claimed that the FSC is allowing rival nations to lead in crypto ETFs. Jung Eun-bo, chairman of the Korea Exchange (KRX), said last month that the country risks falling behind if it delays crypto ETF adoption. “Cryptocurrency represents a sector capable of generating new value in the financial industry,” Jung stated. “We must not delay the introduction of cryptocurrency ETF trading.” The post South Korean Ruling Party Head Considers Approving Spot Crypto ETFs appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Crypto ETFs|ETFs|South Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|TRADING|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-03-07 09:19:55

For Ethereum developers and stakers, staying informed about network changes is crucial. The latest update from the Ethereum Foundation brings news of a significant shift in their testnet infrastructure. Get ready for an important transition: the Ethereum Foundation has officially announced the deprecation of the Mekong testnet, effective March 7. But what does this mean for you, and why is it happening? Let’s dive into the details of this critical update and understand its implications for the Ethereum ecosystem. Why is Ethereum Deprecating the Mekong Testnet? The Ethereum Foundation’s decision to deprecate the Mekong testnet is a strategic move aligned with the ongoing development and enhancement of the Ethereum network. Mekong was specifically created as a testing ground for wallet developers to experiment with user experience (UX) improvements and for stakers to get hands-on experience with the upcoming Pectra upgrade. However, as development progresses, testnets also need to evolve to accurately reflect the current state of the Ethereum mainnet and future upgrades. Here’s a breakdown of the key reasons behind the Mekong testnet deprecation: Pectra Upgrade Activation on Sepolia and Holesky: The primary reason for Mekong’s sunset is the successful activation of the Pectra upgrade on the Sepolia and Holesky testnets. These testnets are now fully equipped to handle the testing needs related to Pectra, rendering Mekong’s specific purpose redundant. Streamlining Testnet Infrastructure: Maintaining multiple testnets requires resources and can sometimes lead to fragmentation of the testing community. By deprecating Mekong, the Ethereum Foundation is streamlining its testnet infrastructure, focusing developer and staker activity on Sepolia and Holesky. Focus on Long-Term, Robust Testnets: Sepolia and Holesky are designed as long-term, robust testnets intended to mirror the mainnet environment closely. Concentrating development and testing efforts on these networks ensures a more consistent and reliable testing experience for the Ethereum community. Essentially, the deprecation of Mekong is not a setback but a sign of progress. It indicates that the Ethereum development roadmap is advancing, and the testing infrastructure is being optimized to support future innovations. Understanding the Pectra Upgrade and its Role in the Ethereum Ecosystem The Pectra upgrade is a significant step forward for Ethereum, encompassing both the consensus layer (execution layer) and the execution layer (EVM) changes. It’s designed to enhance the network’s capabilities, efficiency, and user experience. Mekong testnet was instrumental in the early stages of testing UX changes related to this upgrade. Now, with Pectra live on Sepolia and Holesky, developers have more advanced and stable environments to continue their work. Key aspects of the Pectra upgrade include: Execution Layer Improvements (EVM): Pectra brings enhancements to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), potentially leading to increased smart contract efficiency and new functionalities for developers. Consensus Layer Upgrades: Changes in the consensus layer aim to improve network security, stability, and the overall staking experience. This is crucial for the long-term health and decentralization of Ethereum. UX Enhancements: As Mekong was initially focused on UX changes, Pectra likely includes features designed to make Ethereum more user-friendly, especially for wallet users and those interacting with decentralized applications (dApps). For a detailed breakdown of all the technical specifications and features included in the Pectra upgrade, developers are encouraged to refer to the official Ethereum Foundation blog and developer resources. Understanding Pectra is vital for anyone building on or interacting with the Ethereum network. What are Sepolia and Holesky Testnets and Why are They Important? With Mekong being retired, Sepolia and Holesky are now the primary focus for Ethereum testing. These are not just replacements; they are designed to be superior testnets offering a more realistic and comprehensive testing environment. Let’s explore what makes them crucial for Ethereum development: Sepolia Testnet: Permissioned and Stable: Sepolia is a permissioned proof-of-stake testnet, meaning it has a controlled set of validators. This permissioned nature contributes to its stability and predictability, making it ideal for application developers who need a reliable environment to test smart contracts and dApps. Realistic State: Sepolia aims to maintain a state that is reasonably close to the Ethereum mainnet, allowing developers to test under conditions that mirror the real-world network. Focus on Application Development: Sepolia is particularly well-suited for testing application-level functionalities, smart contract interactions, and integrations with other Ethereum ecosystem tools. Holesky Testnet: Public and Scalable: Holesky is designed as a public, open-participation testnet. It is intended to simulate the more open and permissionless nature of the Ethereum mainnet. Large Scale Testing: Holesky is built to handle larger scale testing scenarios, including network stress tests and simulations of high transaction volume. This makes it valuable for testing infrastructure and network-level upgrades. Staking and Protocol Development: Holesky is particularly relevant for stakers and protocol developers who need to test changes in a more decentralized and potentially volatile environment, similar to mainnet conditions. By utilizing both Sepolia and Holesky, Ethereum developers and stakers gain access to a diverse and robust suite of testing environments, catering to different needs and development stages. Actionable Insights for Developers and Stakers The Mekong testnet deprecation requires immediate action from developers and stakers who were utilizing it. Here’s a step-by-step guide to ensure a smooth transition: Migrate from Mekong: If you are currently using Mekong for testing or development, immediately begin migrating your activities to either Sepolia or Holesky, depending on your testing requirements. Update Configurations: Update your development tools, scripts, and configurations to point to the Sepolia or Holesky testnet endpoints. Ensure your wallet and node setups are correctly configured for the new testnets. Familiarize with Sepolia and Holesky: If you are new to Sepolia or Holesky, take time to explore their characteristics and choose the one that best suits your testing needs. Review the official Ethereum documentation for setup guides and network details. Stay Updated: Regularly check the Ethereum Foundation blog and developer channels for the latest updates on testnet infrastructure, Pectra upgrade progress, and any further announcements. Community Engagement: Engage with the Ethereum developer community through forums, chats, and social media to share experiences, ask questions, and stay informed about best practices for testing on Sepolia and Holesky. The deprecation date of March 7 is an important deadline. Ensure all necessary migrations and updates are completed before this date to avoid any disruption to your development or testing workflows. Embracing Change and Moving Forward with Ethereum Development The Ethereum ecosystem is characterized by continuous evolution and improvement. The deprecation of the Mekong testnet, while requiring adjustments, is a positive indicator of this ongoing progress. By focusing resources on Sepolia and Holesky, the Ethereum Foundation is providing developers and stakers with more robust, relevant, and future-proof testing environments. This strategic shift strengthens the foundation for future upgrades and innovations on Ethereum. For developers, this means access to better tools and more realistic testing conditions, ultimately leading to more reliable and efficient dApps and smart contracts. For stakers, it ensures a testing ground that closely mirrors the mainnet, allowing for thorough preparation for protocol upgrades. Embrace this change as a step forward in the journey of Ethereum, and leverage the enhanced capabilities of Sepolia and Holesky to drive your contributions to this groundbreaking blockchain.

The expiry, set for 8:00 UTC on Deribit, could lead to increased volatility in the crypto market. The “put-to-call ratio” of 0.67 shows that there are more put options (bets that Bitcoin’s price will fall) than call options (bets that Bitcoin’s price will rise). And the maximum pain point, that is the price that will cause the most losses for holders is $89,000. Besides, Ethereum will also have a large number of contracts expire, totaling $481.9 million. The “maximum pain point” for Ethereum is $2,300, and the put-to-call ratio of 0.72. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have put-to-call ratios below 1, meaning there are more traders betting on price increases (buying calls) than on price drops (buying puts). Bearish Sentiment In The Market The overall sentiment in the crypto market is negative (bearish). Bitcoin’s recent price swings, such as drops of $6,000, have created a volatile market that traders are finding difficult to navigate, often experiencing losses in both directions. Analysts from Greeks.live note that traders are focusing on key price levels, with resistance around $87,000-$89,000 and a recent bottom around $82,000, though there is disagreement on whether the bottom is sustainable. The market’s pessimism is evident in the higher number of traders buying options for downside protection (puts). The market is currently volatile, with traders focusing on quick entries and exits due to the risk of sudden price changes. Factors like trade policies and tariffs add uncertainty, making many traders cautious. Bitcoin Declines After Trump’s Reserve Announcment After Bitcoin options expire, prices may settle, but generally markets return to normal soon. This comes after President Trump’s recent executive order on the Bitcoin reserve, although many details are still unclear and are expected to be discussed at the White House Crypto Summit. Contrary to the expectations, Bitcoin dropped 5% to $84,667 following President Trump’s Bitcoin reserve announcement, triggering $261 million in liquidations in the futures market. Major Summit Ahead Bitcoin’s price dropped ahead of a major crypto summit, with long positions suffering the most. Liquidations reached $115.6 million, and BTC’s open interest fell by 5%. If the downtrend continues, BTC could test support at $85,357 and possibly drop to $80,580. However, if new demand pushes the price up, BTC could rise back above $90,000, potentially reaching $92,247.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ETH|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-07 09:22:08

The post included a screenshot of Kraken listing the five cryptocurrencies announced so far: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. The post quickly gained traction within the XRP community. Adoption is a key driver of growth for the digital asset, and putting it in the crypto reserve will boost its credibility. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!! Major exchange “Kraken” has released a list of “US Strategic Reserve” assets! #XRP pic.twitter.com/2wV3kBM40I — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) March 5, 2025 Official Announcement and Market Response On March 2, President Donald Trump formally announced the U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve , confirming that the government would hold select cryptocurrencies as part of a national strategy. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has consistently called for an inclusive reserve with multiple assets, and Trump’s inclusion of XRP is a major victory for the community and Ripple. Following the announcement, XRP surged to $2.97. Some analysts predict it could reach double-digit prices due to growing institutional adoption and regulatory clarity. While there have been some market corrections, investor sentiment remains overwhelmingly bullish. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Growing Institutional Legitimacy and Media Recognition In addition to the Kraken listing, mainstream media outlets have begun covering XRP’s inclusion in the reserve. A recent Fox News segment drew attention to the government’s adoption of crypto assets, reinforcing the significance of this decision. Coverage from the mainstream media has further cemented XRP’s growing legitimacy in institutional finance. Many believe this recognition will encourage more adoption from banks, financial institutions, and policymakers. The Future of XRP and U.S. Crypto Strategy With the U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve officially established, XRP is positioned as a key player in the country’s evolving digital asset strategy. Analysts speculate this could accelerate regulatory clarity, benefiting XRP’s long-term adoption. The current administration’s stance on cryptocurrency is evident in the recent string of crypto-related lawsuit dismissals, and the announcement of the first-ever White House Crypto Summit. While the Ripple lawsuit is yet to be dismissed, experts suggest it could happen as soon as today . The regulatory landscape in the U.S. is shifting rapidly, and Trump is on track to fulfill his promise of making the U.S. the crypto capital of the world.

In a recent statement, Yakovenko likened the Bitcoin reserve to a “scalpel,” suggesting that the move marks a significant step towards regulatory clarity. Notably, the Solana founder’s statement underscores the administration’s targeted and precise regulatory framework for digital assets. Let’s unveil how Anatoly Yakovenko views Trump’s Bitcoin reserve strategy. Donald Trump’s Bitcoin EO is a Scalpel, Says Solana Co-Founder Donald Trump’s recent executive order for a strategic crypto reserve has invoked widespread enthusiasm. Despite some disagreements with the inclusion of altcoins like XRP, SOL, and ADA, the crypto community stands strong with the Bitcoin order. In a recent X post , Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko addressed the Bitcoin reserve plan as a scalpel. This suggests that the EO’s regulatory approach is characterized by precision and specificity, rather than overly restrictive measures. Significantly, the Solana co-founder’s message highlight the nuances of crypto regulatory landscape and the need for clarity. Yakovenko emphasized that the Bitcoin order will pave the way for more regulatory clarity in the US. He added, “We need a stablecoin bill, guidance to let banks deposit and withdraw crypto, clear rules from the sec and cftc for issuance and defi.” Solana Co-Founder Opposes Crypto Reserve Proposal Despite his recent endorsement, the Solana co-founder criticized Donald Trump’s crypto reserve proposal. His criticisms were based on the idea that the government control could undermine the notion of decentralization. Recently, Yakovenko outlined his preferences regarding a US reserve of cryptocurrencies, with his top choice being no reserve at all. His second preference was to allow individual states to oversee their own reserves. This approach, he believes, would provide a safeguard against potential missteps by the Federal Reserve. In addition to Yakovenko’s opposition, controversy arose when Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson revealed that he had not been invited to the Crypto Summit, where discussions on the reserve were slated to take place. How Will Donald Trump’s Crypto Reserve Reshape Financial Space? According to Robert Kiyosaki, the author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” Bitcoin could heal America’s financial woes. With Trump’s decision to adopt a Bitcoin reserve, the cryptocurrency is poised to reach new all-time highs, stated Kiyosaki. However, Trump’s crypto policies could be a threat to Wall Street . Primarily due to the possible growth of stablecoins, which in turn boosts Silicon Valley’s establishment, the traditional financial ecosystem could collapse. Thus Trump’s pro-crypto stance signals the potential downfall of Wall Street.

Bitcoin Exchange Netflow Has Been Negative Recently According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, Bitcoin has been leaving exchanges recently. The on-chain metric of relevance here is the “Exchange Netflow,” which measures the net amount of BTC entering into or exiting out of the wallets associated with all centralized exchanges. When the value of the indicator is positive, it means the investors are making net deposits of the cryptocurrency into these platforms. As one of the main reasons why holders transfer their tokens to exchanges is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can have a bearish impact on the BTC price. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Price Range Could Be The Bulls’ Final Defense Line, Report Says On the other hand, the metric being under the zero mark suggests the outflows are overwhelming the inflows. Generally, investors take their coins off into self-custody when they plan to hold into the long term, so such a trend can prove to be bullish for the asset. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Exchange Netflow over the past week or so: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Exchange Netflow saw a spike into the positive region on the 27th of last month, but the metric has since remained in the negative region. This trend has maintained despite the fact that the asset has been observing volatility in both directions recently. Thus, it would appear that the investors are still bullish on the cryptocurrency. “Despite the recent market fear, traders have shown conviction in BTC, withdrawing nearly $900 million worth of Bitcoin from exchanges in the past 7 days,” notes the analytics firm. While exchange inflows can be bearish when it comes to volatile assets like BTC, the same doesn’t hold true in the case of stablecoins, digital assets that have their value tied to fiat. Usually, investors who hold these coins eventually plan to invest into the volatile side of the market. Once they feel the time has come, they deposit into the exchanges to swap to the tokens of their choice, thus providing a buying pressure to their prices. Related Reading: Litecoin Whale Deposits 500,000 LTC To Binance: Price Decline To Extend? As such, an increase in stablecoin inflows can be a positive sign for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This trend has recently been developing in the sector, as an analyst has pointed out in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post. As displayed in the above chart, the Binance Stablecoin Exchange Reserve, a metric that keeps track of the total amount of these fiat-tied tokens sitting in the wallets of the Binance platform, has jumped to a new all-time high (ATH) recently.

Let’s dive into what this could mean for your crypto holdings and the future of value within the Jito network. Decoding the New JTO Tokenomics Vision Andrew Thurman, a key contributor to the Jito Foundation – the driving force behind the popular Solana-based liquid staking protocol – has recently shared a compelling paper outlining a novel approach to JTO tokenomics. It’s crucial to understand that this isn’t an official governance proposal just yet, but rather a thought-provoking exploration of how the Jito DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) could strategically manage its revenues. The core objective? To channel value back to the very users who contribute to the Jito ecosystem. Think of it like this: the Jito protocol generates revenue, and the question is, how can this revenue be best utilized to strengthen the ecosystem and reward its participants? Thurman’s paper offers potential pathways, with a significant emphasis on strategies that could directly enhance the value proposition for JTO token holders. Token Buybacks: A Game Changer for Crypto Value? One of the most intriguing ideas put forth is the potential implementation of token buybacks. But what exactly are token buybacks, and why are they generating excitement in the context of JTO and crypto value? Understanding Token Buybacks: In traditional finance, companies sometimes buy back their own stock from the open market. This reduces the number of shares in circulation, potentially increasing the value of the remaining shares. In the crypto world, token buybacks operate on a similar principle. How it Could Work for JTO: The Jito DAO could use a portion of the protocol’s revenues to purchase JTO tokens from exchanges. This would decrease the supply of JTO tokens available, potentially driving up demand and, consequently, the price. Returning Value to Users: By potentially increasing the token price, buybacks can be a direct mechanism to return value to JTO token holders. This is especially relevant for users who have staked their Solana through Jito and received JTO tokens as rewards or participated in the Jito ecosystem in other ways. Imagine a scenario where the Jito protocol is thriving, generating substantial revenue. If the DAO decides to implement token buybacks, a portion of this success could directly translate into increased value for your JTO tokens. This creates a positive feedback loop, where the protocol’s success directly benefits its community. Exploring Other Avenues to Enhance Crypto Value While token buybacks are a prominent highlight, Thurman’s paper likely delves into a broader spectrum of strategies for the Jito DAO to consider. These could include: Staking Rewards Boosts: Directly increasing the rewards for staking Solana through Jito. This could attract more users to the platform and further solidify its position in the Solana staking landscape. Ecosystem Development Grants: Allocating funds to support projects and initiatives that build on top of the Jito protocol or contribute to the broader Solana DeFi ecosystem. This can foster innovation and long-term growth. Community Initiatives: Investing in community-focused programs, education, or events to strengthen engagement and participation within the Jito ecosystem. The key takeaway is that the Jito Foundation is actively exploring ways to ensure that the protocol’s success translates into tangible benefits for its users and the wider Solana community. This user-centric approach is crucial for the sustainable growth and vibrancy of any DeFi protocol. What Does This Mean for Solana Staking Enthusiasts? If you are actively involved in Solana staking or are considering exploring opportunities within the Solana DeFi space, the potential shifts in JTO tokenomics are definitely worth monitoring. Here’s a breakdown of why this news is relevant: Aspect Implication for Solana Staking Enthusiasts Potential for Increased JTO Value Token buybacks and other value-enhancing strategies could lead to appreciation in the price of JTO tokens you hold. Stronger Jito Ecosystem Focus on user value can contribute to a more robust and engaged Jito community, benefiting all participants. Innovation in DeFi Rewards Jito’s approach could set a precedent for other DeFi protocols to prioritize returning value to their users, fostering a healthier and more sustainable DeFi ecosystem. DAO Governance Participation As these ideas evolve into formal proposals, JTO token holders may have the opportunity to participate in governance decisions, shaping the future of JTO tokenomics. It’s important to remember that these are still proposed ideas, and the Jito DAO will ultimately decide on the final direction for JTO tokenomics. However, the fact that these discussions are happening and that there’s a clear focus on user value is a positive signal for the Jito community and the broader Solana DeFi landscape. Navigating the Future of JTO and DeFi The evolving tokenomics of JTO highlights a critical trend in the DeFi space: the increasing emphasis on user empowerment and value distribution. Protocols are realizing that long-term success hinges on creating sustainable ecosystems where users are not just participants but also beneficiaries of the protocol’s growth. Jito’s proactive approach to refining its tokenomics model is a testament to this evolving paradigm. As you navigate the dynamic world of DeFi and Solana staking, staying informed about developments like these is crucial. Keep an eye on official announcements from the Jito Foundation and engage with the Jito community to stay ahead of the curve. The future of JTO tokenomics holds exciting possibilities, potentially unlocking even greater value for users and solidifying Jito’s position as a leading protocol in the Solana ecosystem.

The latest buzz is all about a bold move from former U.S. President Donald Trump that has the crypto world talking. According to Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at Bitwise, a well-known crypto index fund manager, Trump’s newly signed Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is a significant development. While the immediate market reaction remains to be seen, Hougan confidently stated on X (formerly Twitter) that this is a highly bullish signal for Bitcoin (BTC) in the long run. Let’s dive into what this order entails and why industry experts are optimistic. Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: A Game Changer? The news broke via a tweet from David Sacks, often referred to as the White House crypto czar. Sacks revealed that President Trump had indeed signed an Executive Order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . This isn’t just about holding some Bitcoin; it’s a formal government initiative to establish a reserve, signaling a major shift in how the U.S. government views and interacts with cryptocurrency. But what exactly does this mean for the crypto market and for Bitcoin specifically? Let’s break down the key aspects: Government Backed Bitcoin Holding: The U.S. government is officially stepping into the role of a significant Bitcoin holder, albeit through seized assets. No Taxpayer Burden: Crucially, the reserve will be funded entirely by Bitcoin already in government possession, specifically BTC seized through federal law enforcement actions. This means no new costs for taxpayers. Substantial Existing Holdings: Estimates suggest the U.S. government already holds around 200,000 BTC. To put this into perspective, at current prices, this is a multi-billion dollar reserve! Formal Review Mandated: The Executive Order mandates a formal review and audit of these existing US Bitcoin Holdings . This suggests a move towards greater transparency and formalization of these assets. Potential for Further Acquisition: The order goes a step further, authorizing the Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce to explore ways to acquire even more BTC in a budget-neutral manner. This indicates a proactive approach to potentially grow the reserve in the future. Why is Bitwise CIO So Bullish on this Bitcoin Order? Matt Hougan’s positive reaction isn’t just casual optimism. As a leading voice in crypto investment, his perspective carries weight. Why does he see Trump’s Bitcoin Order as a long-term positive? Here are a few key reasons to consider: Validation and Legitimacy: A formal Strategic Bitcoin Reserve from a major global power like the United States sends a powerful message. It legitimizes Bitcoin as a significant asset class on a national level. This can boost confidence among institutional investors and the general public alike. Reduced Regulatory Uncertainty: Government engagement, even in this form, can be interpreted as a step towards clearer regulatory frameworks. By creating a reserve, the government implicitly acknowledges Bitcoin’s importance, potentially leading to more constructive regulatory approaches in the long run. Supply Dynamics: Holding a significant amount of Bitcoin in a reserve effectively takes that BTC out of active circulation. With Bitcoin’s limited supply, reduced available supply can, in theory, exert upward pressure on price over time, especially as demand grows. Geopolitical Implications: In an increasingly digital and potentially multi-polar world, nations holding Bitcoin reserves could be seen as strategically positioned in the future financial landscape. This order could be interpreted as the U.S. staking a claim in the digital asset space. Unpacking the US Bitcoin Holdings: 200,000 BTC and Counting? The estimated figure of 200,000 BTC held by the U.S. government is substantial. Where did this Bitcoin come from? Primarily, it’s the result of: Law Enforcement Seizures: A significant portion originates from seizures related to criminal activities, particularly in the early days of Bitcoin when it was often associated with illicit online marketplaces. Forfeiture and Confiscation: Through various legal processes, the government has acquired Bitcoin as proceeds of crime and through asset forfeiture. While 200,000 BTC is a widely cited estimate, it’s important to note that: No Public Audit: As the announcement mentions, a full, public audit of these holdings hasn’t been conducted yet. The Executive Order mandates a review, which could bring more clarity to the exact figures. Decentralized Nature of Bitcoin: Tracking government-held Bitcoin can be complex due to the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin addresses and transactions. The mandated review is a positive step towards transparency and responsible management of these significant US Bitcoin Holdings . Crypto Market Impact: Short-Term Uncertainty, Long-Term Optimism? While Matt Hougan emphasizes the long-term bullish outlook, he also acknowledges short-term market uncertainty. What could we expect in the immediate future in terms of Crypto Market Impact ? Potential Short-Term Reactions: Price Volatility: Major news events in crypto often trigger price volatility. The market could react with initial price swings in either direction as traders digest the information. Speculation and Rumors: Announcements like this can fuel speculation and rumors, potentially leading to short-term price pumps or dumps based on market sentiment. Regulatory Scrutiny: The news might also intensify regulatory discussions and scrutiny around government holdings of cryptocurrency, which could introduce short-term uncertainty. Long-Term Positive Drivers: Increased Institutional Interest: The U.S. government’s move could further pique the interest of institutional investors who were previously hesitant about Bitcoin. Mainstream Adoption: Government validation can contribute to the ongoing mainstream adoption narrative for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. Positive Sentiment Shift: Over time, the establishment of a reserve could contribute to a more positive long-term sentiment towards Bitcoin, fostering greater investment and adoption. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? So, what should crypto enthusiasts and investors take away from this development? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on further developments related to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . The mandated review and any future acquisition plans will be crucial to monitor. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term market fluctuations are always possible, consider the long-term implications of government validation and potential increased institutional interest in Bitcoin. Diversification and Risk Management: As always, remember the importance of diversification and sound risk management in your crypto portfolio. News like this is significant but the crypto market remains dynamic and evolving. Conclusion: A Strategic Move Towards a Bitcoin Future? Trump’s Executive Order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is undoubtedly a landmark moment for the cryptocurrency industry. While the immediate market reaction may be unpredictable, the long-term implications are potentially profound. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan’s bullish stance reflects a broader sentiment that this move signals a significant step towards mainstream acceptance and long-term growth for Bitcoin. As the U.S. government formalizes its role in the Bitcoin ecosystem, it could pave the way for greater clarity, legitimacy, and ultimately, a more robust future for crypto.

Despite signs of recovery in late 2024, the momentum seems to have stalled, according to DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas, who outlined the sharp decline in a March 6 report. In December 2024, total NFT trading volume stood at $1.36 billion . However, January saw a 26% month-over-month drop, and February delivered an even steeper 50% decline, wiping out much of the recent progress in the sector. “While NFTs appeared to be making a comeback, the trend reversed at the beginning of 2025,” Gherghelas noted, attributing the slump to NFTs’ correlation with cryptocurrency prices. Indeed, the overall crypto market capitalization peaked at $3.71 trillion on December 9, with Bitcoin hitting a record $109,000 on January 20, shortly before Donald Trump’s inauguration. However, February brought uncertainty, as concerns over Trump’s trade tariffs triggered a market-wide selloff, erasing much of the crypto sector’s gains. Surprising Uptick in NFT User Activity While trading volumes tumbled, user engagement with NFT platforms actually rose, showing a 6% increase in February with around 3.5 million unique users. DappRadar suggests that this rise was driven by growing interest in AI-powered digital assets, which are reshaping the NFT landscape. “The increasing integration of artificial intelligence into NFT projects signals a shift toward more dynamic, interactive digital assets with enhanced utility,” Gherghelas explained. She emphasized that NFTs offering real-world applications and deeper engagement will likely drive long-term Web3 adoption, even as speculative trading wanes. When breaking down NFT sales by category, profile picture NFTs remained the top performer, with $243 million in trading volume spread across 76,385 sales. Gaming NFTs followed, generating $41 million from 421,853 transactions, while sports NFTs saw the highest number of transactions (659,097) but only $7.7 million in volume. A Market Struggling to Regain Its Peak Despite short-term fluctuations, the NFT market remains far from its golden era. According to a January DappRadar report, 2024 marked the worst year for NFTs since 2020, with just $13.7 billion in trading volume and under 50 million total sales. For context, NFTs had their best-ever year in 2022, when mainstream hype drove $57.2 billion in trading volume and 121.7 million sales. Whether the market can reclaim those highs remains uncertain, but the industry’s focus seems to be shifting from hype-driven speculation to long-term utility and engagement.

Unlike traditional presales segmented into stages, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) takes a different approach. Its presale is structured around unique locations, each symbolizing a new chapter in Pablo’s quest. Arctic Pablo has reached ChillVille, the 13th location in its journey, with the coin priced at $0.000070. The presale has already raised over $1.77 million, reflecting growing investor interest.

Bybit ‘s $1.4 billion cyberattack, now the largest crypto theft in history, is believed to have started with malware from a fake stock investment project that compromised Safe’s Mac laptop and bypassed Amazon Web Services security, according to Mandiant’s investigation. In a March 6 article on X, Safe revealed that the North Korean hacking group known as TraderTraitor compromised a Safe{Wallet} developer’s laptop, “Developer1,” and used stolen AWS session tokens to bypass multi-factor authentication. According to Mandiant’s investigation, the breach occurred on Feb. 4, when a Docker project — posing as a “stock investment simulator” — was downloaded onto Developer1’s Mac. The project communicated with a suspicious domain (getstockprice[.]com), leading to the malware’s installation. You might also like: Bybit sparks debates as it seeks nearly $100k in refund from ParaSwap DAO tied to hacker’s swap fees It’s unclear what forced Developer1 to download the malware through workstation, but the investigation notes that similar social engineering tactics have already been used in previous attacks by the hacking group. Mandiant’s report also found that the attackers bypassed AWS MFA by hijacking active user session tokens, likely through malware on Developer1’s workstation. These hijacked tokens allowed the hackers to access AWS services without needing to pass MFA checks. The attack was conducted from IP addresses linked to a VPN service and security tools designed for offensive hacking, per the report. “Certain gaps in fully recovering certain aspects of the attack remain because the attacker removed their malware and cleared Bash history in an effort to thwart investigative efforts.” Safe As a precautious measure, Safe{Wallet} has reset its infrastructure, restricting external access. It also claims to have enhanced the detection of malicious transactions with Blockaid, a blockchain security firm. According to Safe, its smart contracts were not affected by the breach. Cryptocurrency exchange Bybit revealed in early March that nearly 20% of the stolen funds are now untraceable, just less than two weeks after the exchange lost $1.46 billion in a highly sophisticated attack. In an X post, Bybit CEO Ben Zhou revealed that around 77% of the stolen funds remain traceable, but nearly 20% has “gone dark” through mixing services.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Ethereum strengthens its network and Chainlink expands its dominance, investors are turning to BitLemons, a revenue-generating crypto with deflationary tokenomics. Table of Contents Has BitLemons found the perfect formula for sustainable token growth? Is Chainlink positioning for a new all-time high? When will Ethereum break its resistance ceiling? How are wealth creators positioning in today’s market? Ethereum’s technical breakthroughs and Chainlink’s double-digit gains dominate headlines, but savvy investors are quietly positioning themselves in BitLemons (BLEM) before it hits exchanges. With its GambleFi protocol already generating actual revenue, dual security audits, and a presale that’s 49% complete in stage 2, BLEM offers rare ground-floor access to what analysts predict could be crypto’s next explosive growth story. Has BitLemons found the perfect formula for sustainable token growth? BitLemons is disrupting the $450 billion traditional casino market with its GambleFi protocol that’s already operational with over 8,000 games from premium providers including Evolution and Pragmatic. Unlike speculative tokens, BitLemons generates revenue 24/7 while allocating 30% of all Gross Gaming Revenue directly to token holders, 15% through strategic buyback and burn mechanisms creating deflationary pressure, and 15% as high-yield staking rewards. With dual security audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof and $1 million raised in its private seed round, BitLemons has extraordinary momentum. Stage 1 sold out in just 16 days, and Stage 2 is already 49% complete at $0.02 per token with over $1.62 million raised. With fewer than 17 million tokens remaining before the price increases to $0.03 in 13 days and industry insiders projecting a listing price between $0.17-$0.18, early investors are positioning for potential 8-9x returns from current levels. Is Chainlink positioning for a new all-time high? Chainlink (LINK) has demonstrated remarkable resilience, trading at $17.11 with a 22% surge over the past week. The decentralized oracle network continues to expand its ecosystem, establishing itself as the critical infrastructure connecting smart contracts with real-world data. LINK’s technical indicators reveal a decisive breakout above key resistance levels, accompanied by an abnormally high trading volume of $1.17b. The token has established strong support at the $15.00 level while facing resistance near $17.64. With a market capitalization now exceeding $10.91b and bullish sentiment at 87%, institutional interest continues to flow into the project as it cements its position as an essential blockchain infrastructure. You might also like: Is BitLemons quietly becoming a bigger opportunity than Bitcoin and TRUMP? When will Ethereum break its resistance ceiling? Ethereum has been steadily reclaiming lost ground, trading at $2,196.07 with a 2.6% gain over the past week. Despite recent security concerns, including reports of hackers linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group laundering nearly 500,000 ETH, the market remains optimistic about Ethereum’s fundamentals. ETH’s $264.78b market cap is supported by a significant trading volume of $21.27b, signaling renewed investor confidence in the smart contract platform. The successful Pectra testnet upgrade has bolstered expectations for improved scalability and transaction efficiency in the upcoming main net implementation, addressing long-standing user concerns. Key support has formed at $2,100 with resistance around $2,300, suggesting a potential continuation of the upward trajectory if market conditions remain favorable. How are wealth creators positioning in today’s market? While Ethereum and Chainlink present compelling cases for continued growth, BitLemons stands apart with its revenue-generating platform already in operation. At just $0.02 during Stage 2 and analysts projecting listing prices of $0.17-$0.18, the mathematical advantage becomes clear. With Stage 2 presale already 49% complete and only 13 days remaining until the next price increase, this rare ground-floor opportunity is rapidly disappearing. The only question savvy investors are asking is how substantial a position to establish before this window closes. For more information on BitLemons, visit the website or socials .

As a result, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Floki (FLOKI) have already set the ball rolling, as evidenced by a triple-digit year-to-date surge. Durag Doge ($DURAG) is also not being left out in spite being the new kid on the meme coin block, This is because it's a meme coin with swag with its long-term objective being blending innovation, community, and culture. Durag Doge Keeps the Meme Coin Ball Rolling Having recorded a year-to-date increase of 238.2% , Dogecoin continues to steal the limelight at the top meme coin. By stamping its authority as one of the top 10 cryptos despite previously being deemed an internet joke, DOGE has become a force to be reckoned with in crypto circles. With its roots being heavily embedded as a Doge ecosystem meme coin, Durag Doge has set the ball rolling as a coin that envisions a community filled with engagement, culture,and fun. Decentralization is also heavily embedded in $DURAG’s bloodstream since decisions related to its future direction, marketing, and development are community influenced. As a result, it has a vision of appreciating all crypto players from go-getters to hustlers since $DURAG appreciates the fact that big wins come from bold moves. Durag Doge Continues to Enjoy a Long-Term Bullish Picture Thanks to Floki’s well spelt out objective of combining the meme coin narrative with utility, the token has been on a rollercoaster ride, having recorded a year-to-date surge of 243.8% . FLOKI has a broad vision of creating a decentralized and autonomous ecosystem consisting of distinctive features, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Durag Doge is also not being left out when it comes to igniting the meme coin fire since it introduces a unique reward mechanism where staking with up to 20% APY becomes a reality. Some of Durag Doge’s core goals include driving a culture shift, fueling the hustle, and empowering the underdog. As a result, $DURAG envisions a future where meme coins aren’t just fleeting trends but cultural icons that unite people through shared energy, ambition, and joy. Conclusion It is now clear that meme coins have become a force to be reckoned with in the crypto sector since they are tied to trends, humor, and internet culture with Dogecoin, Floki, and Durag Doge sitting at the helm.

Investors are always searching for the next big thing, and meme coins continue to surprise everyone. Dogecoin, the original meme coin, has remained a strong player despite market fluctuations. But could it actually 10x sooner than expected? While many are watching DOGE closely, new meme coins like Dawgz AI are emerging with unique value propositions that could challenge the status quo. What Is Dogecoin and Why It Remains a Strong Contender Dogecoin started as a joke in 2013, but it quickly gained a loyal community and real-world adoption. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a capped supply, Dogecoin has an unlimited supply, meaning new coins are continuously minted. This initially led many to believe that it couldn’t hold value long-term. Yet, DOGE has defied expectations, largely thanks to its active community and high-profile endorsements. Another key factor in Dogecoin’s resilience is its low transaction fees and fast block times. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which can struggle with congestion and high fees, DOGE remains an efficient option for transactions. This usability has helped Dogecoin stay relevant, even as newer tokens enter the market. A Brief History of Dogecoin’s Rise to Fame Dogecoin’s journey has been nothing short of extraordinary. What started as an internet joke soon gained momentum when the Reddit and Twitter communities embraced it for tipping and donations. Over the years, DOGE went through multiple bull runs, notably in 2021 when Elon Musk’s tweets sent the price soaring from fractions of a cent to an all-time high of $0.73. Even though DOGE has since retraced, it remains one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies. The coin’s ability to generate hype—often driven by social media and high-profile endorsements—means it can quickly gain momentum again. And with new meme coins like Dawgz AI gaining traction, the competition is heating up. Why Dogecoin Still Holds Value in 2025 As we move into 2025, Dogecoin’s future remains promising for several reasons. First, major businesses like Tesla and AMC Theatres now accept DOGE as payment, increasing its real-world utility. Additionally, developers are actively working on improvements, including potential upgrades that could make Dogecoin even more competitive in the crypto space. Another reason for Dogecoin’s lasting value is its strong community support. Unlike many projects that fade away, DOGE has an army of supporters willing to rally behind it. This level of engagement keeps Dogecoin relevant and ensures it will likely remain a staple of the meme coin market. Dogecoin Price Predictions for 2025 and Beyond So, what’s next for DOGE? Many analysts believe Dogecoin could hit $1 in the next bull run, given its historical patterns and growing adoption. However, can it go even further? If momentum builds, there’s potential for a 10x return, especially if macroeconomic conditions favor cryptocurrencies. While Dogecoin remains a strong contender, new players like Dawgz AI are introducing innovative concepts to the meme coin space. As a result, investors are exploring opportunities beyond DOGE, diversifying into projects that offer additional value beyond just hype. Can DOGE Really 10x From Here A 10x increase from Dogecoin’s current price would require a major catalyst. Regulatory clarity, increased institutional adoption, and broader crypto market growth could all contribute to such a surge. Historically, DOGE has shown that when sentiment turns bullish, its price can skyrocket in a short period. However, competition from new meme coins means that investors are now looking for projects that offer more than just a recognizable brand. While DOGE could still see major gains, the rise of AI-driven tokens and other innovations could shift market dynamics. Analysts’ DOGE Price Forecasts for the Coming Years Crypto analysts have varying opinions on Dogecoin’s future price action. Some predict a conservative $0.50-$1 range in the next bull cycle, while more optimistic forecasts see $5 or higher if mass adoption continues. That said, many agree that meme coins are here to stay, and their market influence is growing. With projects like Dawgz AI attracting investor interest, the meme coin sector could see explosive growth beyond just Dogecoin. Factors That Could Influence Dogecoin’s Price The price of Dogecoin is influenced by a variety of factors, ranging from market sentiment to technological advancements. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, DOGE’s value is often dictated by community enthusiasm, social media trends, and endorsements from high-profile figures. While some investors see it as a speculative asset, others recognize its growing adoption in payment systems and online tipping. Moreover, external factors such as regulatory changes, macroeconomic conditions, and developments in the broader crypto market can also impact Dogecoin’s trajectory. As we move further into 2025, it’s essential to consider these dynamics when evaluating DOGE’s potential for significant gains. The Impact of Elon Musk and Social Media Trends One of the biggest wildcards in Dogecoin’s price movement is Elon Musk. As seen in previous bull runs, a single tweet from Musk can send DOGE soaring. His continued interest in integrating DOGE into Tesla and Twitter (now X) keeps speculation alive. Beyond Musk, social media trends play a major role. If meme culture continues to favor DOGE, it could see another massive price increase. However, if new meme coins gain popularity, Dogecoin’s dominance could be challenged. DOGE’s Utility and Real-World Adoption For Dogecoin to reach new highs, it must improve its real-world use cases. While businesses like Newegg and the Dallas Mavericks accept DOGE for payments, broader adoption is needed for sustained growth. Additionally, developments in blockchain technology—such as Layer 2 solutions—could improve Dogecoin’s efficiency and scalability, making it more attractive for everyday transactions. The Role of Meme Coins Like Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) in the Market As meme coins evolve, Dawgz AI is making waves with a fresh approach.

Final Thoughts – Will Dogecoin Make Millionaires Again Dogecoin’s ability to turn small investments into life-changing wealth has already been proven. Whether it can repeat this feat depends on multiple factors—market cycles, adoption rates, and social media influence. While Dogecoin remains a strong contender, investors are also looking toward emerging meme coins like Dawgz AI for fresh opportunities. If DOGE manages another 10x, it could once again create a new wave of millionaires. But with new players entering the scene, keeping an eye on innovations like Dawgz AI could be just as crucial for those looking to ride the next meme coin wave.
