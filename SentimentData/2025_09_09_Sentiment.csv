While digital assets often carve their own path, the gravitational pull of global currency shifts, interest rates, and investor sentiment in traditional markets like Forex can significantly influence crypto volatility and capital flows. Recently, a significant signal emerged from Bank of America (BofA) that demands attention: their forex quant signals are flashing a decisively bullish outlook for the Swiss Franc (CHF). Decoding Forex Quant Signals : What Are They? What exactly are forex quant signals , and why should they matter to investors, even those primarily focused on digital currencies? In essence, quantitative signals are generated by sophisticated computer models and algorithms that analyze vast amounts of financial data. These models scour historical price movements, trading volumes, economic indicators, news sentiment, and a multitude of other variables to identify patterns and predict future market direction. Think of it as advanced pattern recognition on steroids. Instead of a human analyst sifting through charts for hours, these algorithms process terabytes of data in milliseconds, identifying correlations and divergences that might be imperceptible to the human eye. For the currency market outlook , this means identifying potential shifts in supply and demand for a currency pair, offering an edge to traders and institutions. The benefits of utilizing such signals are manifold: Objectivity: They remove human emotion and bias from trading decisions. Speed: Signals are generated almost instantaneously, allowing for rapid reaction to market changes. Data-Driven: Decisions are based on empirical evidence and statistical probabilities. Scalability: A single model can analyze multiple currency pairs simultaneously. When a major institution like BofA highlights a signal, it suggests their robust models have identified a strong probability of a particular currency’s movement. In this case, it’s the Swiss Franc , indicating a potential period of strength. The Swiss Franc ‘s Enduring Appeal: A Safe Haven? The Swiss Franc has long held a unique position in the global financial landscape. Often dubbed a ‘safe-haven currency,’ it typically attracts capital during times of economic uncertainty, geopolitical turmoil, or financial stress. But what gives the CHF this remarkable resilience? Its reputation is built on several foundational pillars: Political Stability: Switzerland’s long-standing neutrality and stable political environment make it a reliable refuge. Sound Economy: A strong, export-oriented economy with low unemployment and a robust financial sector underpins the currency’s value. Independent Central Bank: The Swiss National Bank (SNB) is known for its independence and prudent monetary policy, focused on price stability. Low Public Debt: Switzerland maintains a relatively low level of government debt compared to many other developed nations, enhancing its fiscal credibility. In the current global environment, characterized by persistent inflation concerns, varying central bank responses, and ongoing geopolitical tensions, the appeal of safe-haven assets like the Swiss Franc becomes even more pronounced. Investors are seeking stability amidst volatility, and the CHF often fits that bill perfectly. This inherent characteristic likely plays a significant role in BofA’s bullish assessment. Unpacking the BofA Currency Forecast : Key Drivers So, what specific factors are driving the bullish BofA currency forecast for the Swiss Franc ? While the precise details of BofA’s proprietary quant models are confidential, their public commentary and the nature of currency markets allow us to infer some key drivers. A combination of fundamental and technical factors likely contribute to this positive outlook: Inflationary Pressures: While inflation has been a global phenomenon, Switzerland has generally managed to keep it relatively contained compared to the Eurozone or the US. This relative stability makes the CHF more attractive as its purchasing power erodes less quickly. Swiss National Bank (SNB) Policy: The SNB has shown a willingness to act decisively to combat inflation and maintain price stability. Their hawkish stance, including interest rate hikes, makes holding CHF-denominated assets more appealing. Global Risk Aversion: As discussed, periods of global economic uncertainty or heightened geopolitical risk typically see capital flow into safe havens. If BofA’s models are detecting an increase in risk aversion among global investors, the CHF would naturally benefit. Interest Rate Differentials: While not always the primary driver for a safe-haven, a favorable interest rate differential compared to other major currencies can provide an additional tailwind for the CHF. Current Account Surplus: Switzerland consistently runs a large current account surplus, meaning it exports more than it imports and receives significant income from foreign investments. This constant inflow of foreign currency demand supports the CHF. The synergy of these factors, when crunched by advanced algorithms, paints a compelling picture of strength for the Swiss Franc . This detailed BofA currency forecast provides valuable intelligence for anyone monitoring global financial markets. Navigating the Broader Currency Market Outlook Understanding the bullish signal for the Swiss Franc requires placing it within the broader currency market outlook . How does the CHF stack up against its major counterparts, and what are the implications for the global economy and various asset classes? Here’s a brief comparative perspective: Currency Current Outlook (General) Impact on CHF US Dollar (USD) Strong due to aggressive Fed hikes, but potential for peaking rates and recession fears could temper its strength. If USD strength wanes, CHF could gain further as an alternative safe haven. If USD remains strong, it could cap some CHF gains. Euro (EUR) Struggling with high inflation, energy crisis, and recession risks in the Eurozone. ECB’s hiking cycle is behind the Fed’s. CHF typically benefits from Eurozone weakness due to geographical proximity and economic ties. Capital flight from EUR often finds a home in CHF. Japanese Yen (JPY) Weakened significantly due to the Bank of Japan’s ultra-loose monetary policy and yield curve control. While JPY is also considered a safe haven, its current monetary policy divergence makes CHF a more attractive safe-haven alternative for many investors. British Pound (GBP) Highly volatile, facing inflation, political instability, and economic growth concerns. Uncertainty in the UK could drive capital towards the stability of the CHF. A stronger Swiss Franc has several implications. For Swiss exporters, it makes their goods more expensive abroad, potentially impacting competitiveness. However, for Swiss consumers, imports become cheaper. Globally, it signifies a flight to quality, indicating that investors are prioritizing capital preservation over higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities. This broader currency market outlook suggests a cautious sentiment pervading financial markets, which could indirectly affect crypto markets as well, as investors might de-risk across the board. Actionable Insights for Your Portfolio: Leveraging Safe-Haven Assets Given BofA’s bullish signal for the Swiss Franc , what are the actionable insights for your investment portfolio? For those accustomed to the rapid movements of digital assets, understanding the nuances of traditional currency markets can offer valuable diversification and risk management strategies. Consider these approaches: Diversification: While not directly investing in CHF might be the primary goal for all crypto investors, understanding its strength highlights a broader trend of risk aversion. This could prompt a review of your overall portfolio allocation, perhaps reducing exposure to highly volatile assets or increasing holdings in more stable, albeit traditional, investments. Indirect Exposure: For those who cannot directly trade currencies, consider assets that might benefit from a stronger CHF or general safe-haven demand. This could include certain Swiss equities or ETFs that track the performance of the Swiss market, though this comes with its own set of risks. Monitoring Macro Trends: The CHF’s strength is a barometer for global sentiment. Its continued ascent, as predicted by forex quant signals , signals ongoing economic uncertainties. This knowledge can inform your crypto trading decisions, prompting caution during periods of heightened global risk. Risk Management: For international businesses or individuals with cross-border financial interests, a strong CHF impacts exchange rates, potentially affecting costs or revenues. Hedging strategies might become more pertinent. However, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and risks. No currency movement is guaranteed, and even sophisticated forex quant signals can be wrong. Geopolitical events can shift rapidly, central bank policies can change unexpectedly, and economic data can surprise. The ‘safe-haven’ status of the Swiss Franc , while historically robust, is not immune to extreme market conditions. Always conduct your own due diligence and consider consulting with a financial advisor before making investment decisions. In conclusion, the powerful bullish signal emanating from Bank of America’s forex quant signals for the Swiss Franc is a significant development in the global financial landscape. It underscores the CHF’s enduring appeal as a safe-haven asset, driven by Switzerland’s economic stability, prudent monetary policy, and the current environment of global uncertainty. This BofA currency forecast , derived from sophisticated algorithmic analysis, provides a compelling reason to pay close attention to the CHF’s trajectory. For investors across all asset classes, including the crypto market, understanding this broader currency market outlook is vital. It’s a reminder that traditional finance and its underlying macro trends continue to exert influence, offering insights into global risk appetite and capital flows. While the future is never certain, the current data points towards a period of sustained strength for the Swiss Franc , positioning it as a key player in the ongoing narrative of global financial stability.

U.S. Republican Representative Zachary Nunn has voiced significant concerns, suggesting that the activities of these Chinese-rooted companies could pose a direct threat to national security. This development has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency community, prompting questions about the future of crypto infrastructure within the nation’s borders. Why Are Bitcoin Mining Rig Manufacturers Under Scrutiny? The core of Representative Nunn’s apprehension, as reported by Bloomberg, lies with two major players: Bitmain and Canaan. These companies are not just any tech firms; they are global leaders among Bitcoin mining rig manufacturers , responsible for producing much of the specialized hardware essential for Bitcoin’s network. Nunn specifically highlighted that these firms are expanding their U.S. footprint using what he describes as “opaque governance structures and financing methods.” This lack of transparency is a critical red flag for policymakers, as it can obscure ownership, funding sources, and potential state influence. Opaque Governance: It becomes difficult to ascertain true ownership and decision-making processes. Unclear Financing: Concerns arise about funding origins and potential foreign government subsidies or directives. Strategic Sector: Bitcoin mining is increasingly seen as a strategic industry due to its energy consumption and role in securing a global financial network. These points collectively raise alarms about potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited, leading to calls for a thorough review. What Does a CFIUS Review Entail for Crypto Firms? Representative Nunn’s call for a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is a significant move. But what exactly is CFIUS, and why is its involvement crucial here? CFIUS is an interagency committee that reviews foreign investments in the U.S. for national security implications. Its mandate is broad, covering everything from critical infrastructure to sensitive technologies. When CFIUS reviews a transaction, it assesses whether the foreign investment could: Grant a foreign entity control over critical U.S. infrastructure. Allow access to sensitive data or technology. Create supply chain vulnerabilities. For Bitcoin mining rig manufacturers , a CFIUS review would scrutinize their U.S. operations, looking at everything from the location of their data centers to their supply chain integrity and the potential for remote access or control over mining hardware. A negative finding could lead to divestment orders or strict operational conditions, profoundly impacting these companies’ ability to operate in the U.S. The Broader Implications for the US Crypto Industry This situation goes beyond just two companies; it reflects a growing tension between fostering innovation in the crypto sector and safeguarding national interests. The U.S. has been actively trying to attract Bitcoin mining operations, seeing it as an opportunity for economic growth and energy grid stabilization. However, the presence of foreign-owned Bitcoin mining rig manufacturers with perceived security risks introduces a complex challenge. Policy analysts suggest that this scrutiny could lead to: Increased Regulatory Scrutiny: Other foreign-owned crypto infrastructure companies might face similar reviews. Diversification of Supply Chains: A push for more domestically produced mining hardware or reliance on manufacturers from allied nations. Impact on Investment: Foreign direct investment in the U.S. crypto sector could become more cautious. The outcome of a potential CFIUS review could set a precedent for how the U.S. government views and regulates foreign participation in its critical digital infrastructure, including the foundational elements provided by Bitcoin mining rig manufacturers . Navigating National Security in a Digital Age The concerns raised by Representative Nunn underscore a critical dilemma: how to embrace the technological advancements of the digital economy while protecting national security in an increasingly interconnected world. The crypto industry, with its global reach and decentralized nature, presents unique challenges for traditional regulatory frameworks. As the debate unfolds, it highlights the need for clear policies that balance economic opportunity with robust security measures. The decisions made regarding these Bitcoin mining rig manufacturers will undoubtedly shape the future landscape of cryptocurrency mining and its integration into the broader U.S. economy. In conclusion, the call for a CFIUS review of Bitmain and Canaan represents a significant moment for the U.S. crypto industry. It signals a heightened awareness among lawmakers about the strategic importance of Bitcoin mining infrastructure and the potential risks associated with foreign influence. As the U.S. strives to maintain its technological edge, navigating these complex national security concerns will be paramount. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are Bitcoin mining rig manufacturers? A1: Bitcoin mining rig manufacturers produce specialized hardware, often called ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits), designed specifically to perform the complex calculations required to mine Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. These machines are crucial for securing the Bitcoin network. Q2: Why are Bitmain and Canaan specifically mentioned? A2: Bitmain and Canaan are two of the largest and most influential Bitcoin mining rig manufacturers globally, both with origins in China. Their significant market share and expansion into the U.S. make them prominent targets for national security scrutiny. Q3: What is the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)? A3: CFIUS is an interagency committee of the U.S. government that reviews certain foreign investments in the U.S. to determine their effect on national security. It can recommend or impose measures to mitigate identified risks, or even block transactions. Q4: What could be the outcome of a CFIUS review for these companies? A4: A CFIUS review could result in several outcomes, ranging from no action to requiring the companies to divest their U.S. assets, modify their operational structures, or agree to specific mitigation measures to address national security concerns. Q5: How might this impact the average crypto miner in the U.S.? A5: While direct impact on individual miners might not be immediate, a CFIUS review could affect the availability or cost of mining hardware if supply chains are disrupted or if the U.S. market becomes less accessible for major manufacturers. It could also encourage the development of domestic manufacturing. Q6: Is this an isolated incident, or part of a larger trend? A6: This incident is part of a broader trend of increased national security scrutiny on foreign technology companies, particularly those with ties to geopolitical rivals. Governments worldwide are becoming more sensitive to the control and influence over critical digital infrastructure. Did you find this analysis insightful?

Buying $GGs during this pre sale cryptocurrency stage involves connecting a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet to the official presale dashboard. Once connected, users can purchase presale crypto tokens and track their allocation. Key highlights of $GGs include: Built on Base for scalability and low fees Integrated trading bot with real-time data insights Streaming services that monetize gameplay and content These features place Based Eggman among the top crypto presales for 2025 , bridging culture and functionality in the world of token presales. Solana: Speed and Scale in the Web3 Crypto Presale Landscape Solana has long been a benchmark for scalability and low transaction costs in the blockchain space. Known for processing thousands of transactions per second, Solana continues to draw interest from investors searching for reliable alternatives to Ethereum. While not a new crypto presale, Solana remains at the center of discussions when comparing altcoin giants with emerging pre sale cryptocurrency projects. The network’s ability to handle high transaction volumes positions it as an important part of the crypto presale list that traders and investors analyze for long-term growth. With a growing ecosystem of decentralized applications, NFTs, and DeFi platforms, Solana consistently proves its place among the top presale crypto coins competitors must measure against. For those evaluating token presales, Solana demonstrates how performance and adoption can transform a blockchain into a central hub for innovation. XRP: Cross-Border Efficiency in Token Presales Comparisons XRP continues to hold relevance in the global financial system by focusing on cross-border transactions and liquidity solutions. Its unique use case appeals to institutions and retail investors alike, setting it apart from speculative-only projects on the crypto presale list. XRP is not a presale token in 2025, but it represents what successful adoption looks like when evaluating new token presales such as Based Eggman. With partnerships across financial institutions and its integration into payment systems, XRP stands as a reminder that token presales must eventually provide real-world value to remain relevant. For investors, XRP acts as a counterbalance to newer presale crypto projects by offering an established foundation of use cases. Comparing XRP with pre sale cryptocurrency initiatives highlights how early-stage enthusiasm must transition into utility and consistent market adoption. Conclusion: Connecting Meme Energy and Altcoin Giants The crypto market is rich with opportunities, from innovative presale crypto tokens like Based Eggman ($GGs) to established players such as Solana and XRP. Each reflects a different stage of development in the lifecycle of cryptocurrency presales. For those examining the best crypto presale to buy right now , Based Eggman offers cultural relevance and integrated functionality. Solana highlights the importance of scalability in supporting widespread adoption, while XRP demonstrates how institutional partnerships and real-world applications can sustain long-term value. Together, these projects provide a broader understanding of where crypto presale projects and established altcoins intersect. Whether exploring presale crypto coins or analyzing established assets, investors are given a view of how culture, technology, and adoption shape the evolving crypto landscape.

Even though volumes are still far from Hyperliquid, they reflect the general demand for perpetual futures trading. Solana is hosting a lively market for perpetual futures trading, recently breaking new records for daily volumes. Based on Glassnode data, perpetual futures open interest on the network is now above $7B, reflecting growing market participation. Perpetual futures DEX trading expanded based on SOL swaps, as the asset broke above $200. The recent market rally was driven by growing open interest, setting new records . Solana continues to outperform, with perp open interest climbing above $7B as price extends beyond $200. Market participation is clearly expanding. Chart Link: https://t.co/Y22U0vAkmf pic.twitter.com/sv7PBryF8o — glassnode (@glassnode) September 9, 2025 The growing volumes coincide with accelerated on-chain settlement for SOL. The asset recovered above $218, sparking a bullish outlook and potentially driving expanded trading volumes. SOL now enjoys a mix of centralized perpetual futures activities and DEX-based swaps. The growth in futures activities happens at a time when SOL sentiment points to greed, based on the Solana fear and greed index . SOL trades on peak open interest SOL open interest on all exchanges is also at a three-year peak of $7.48B , with over 61% in long positions and the emergence of riskier short positions. Increased leveraged positions can also cause SOL volatility, by attempts to liquidate traders. As of September 9, short positions hold over $25M in liquidatable shorts, as SOL trading draws in riskier moves. The shift in short positions followed the breakout above $200, as the market anticipates a drawdown. On Hyperliquid , the biggest single whale position is short on SOL, with over $83M in notional value and a signifirant unrealized loss during the recent rally. The other potential path to SOL is another Solana season, driven by a mix of memes, lending, and other DeFi activities. Value locked is now above $12.24B , also reaching new all-time peaks in the past few weeks. Perpetual futures trading also gained additional liquidity from $12.32B of stablecoins on the Solana network. Jupiter, Drift drive Solana on-chain perpetual DEX Solana on-chain futures are mostly active on Jupiter and Drift Protocol. As of August 25, Jupiter reached over $25B in perpetual futures swaps after months of growth. As Cryptopolitan previously reported , August was a record month for perpetual futures activity on Solana. Jupiter perpetual futures expanded in the past month, still showing strong interest in derivative positions. | Source: DeFi Llama Overall, Solana carries $1.10B in perpetual futures trades, spread across multiple DeFi protocols. Some of the protocols are still relatively small and are competing for growth. Drift attempts to draw in more traders and users with passive income incentives. In the past months, Solana perpetual futures volumes are over $41B, making it the third-largest network carrying this type of decentralized activity. On Hyperliquid, the volumes are at over $385B, though other chains are making their moves. For now, Solana has managed to surpass Ethereum and BSC on the monthly futures volumes, in addition to established L2 chains like Arbitrum and Base. The perpetual futures DEX trend may continue in the coming months, as permissionless chains offer no-KYC access and growing liquidity.

Executive order sets standards for institutional crypto storage. Confiscated assets form the initial reserve with future growth planned. Congress Pushes Bitcoin Reserve Plan Forward Congressman David Joyce introduced the House Appropriations Bill (HR 5166), which requires the U.S. Treasury Department to prepare a comprehensive report on creating a Bitcoin reserve and managing assets within it. Section 137 of the bill instructs Treasury to submit a report within 90 days detailing: Practical possibility of creating such a reserve. Potential obstacles. Possible impact on the agency’s confiscated cryptocurrency assets. Display of crypto assets on the government balance sheet. Contractors responsible for storing these assets. Section 138 mandates that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent provide House committees with a detailed plan describing the infrastructure for storing the reserve’s assets. This includes security protocols and interagency procedures for transferring funds. The bill has been approved by the Appropriations Committee and is now before the House plenary session. Treasury Department Prepares Infrastructure for Crypto Assets Kurt Watkins, founder of Watkins Legal, told Decrypt that the infrastructure developed by the U.S. Treasury Department will likely set industry standards, guiding institutional custodians on best practices. The Bitcoin reserve follows an executive order signed on March 7, 2025, by U.S. President Donald Trump, which also established a broader digital asset reserve including other cryptocurrencies. Currently, both reserves consist solely of confiscated assets. An interdepartmental team is tasked with developing a budget-neutral strategy to replenish the reserves.

The latest report from Outset PR, which analyzed the performance of the LATAM crypto media industry in Q2, shows that there is a sharp contrast between the few publishers (28%) who are surviving and the majority (72%) who are fading into the abyss, struggling to maintain visibility in an era where cryptocurrency adoption is on the rise. These trends, driven by technological changes, market preferences, and increasing adoption, present a clear picture of where publishers and media planners should focus their strategies moving forward. The Big Picture: A Clear Division Between Crypto-Native and Mainstream Media Growth Outset PR’s data shows crypto-native outlets (those that focus only on topics like blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and Web3) in Latin America suffered a 54% quarter-on-quarter traffic drop, plunging from 17.85 million visits in Q1 to just 8.19 million in Q2.On the other hand, mainstream publishers (those that cover crypto as part of a broader range of news or finance topics) added nearly 20 million visits in the same period. Their traffic grew from 243.75 million to 263.20 million in Q2, marking an 8% increase from Q1. This split is what makes the 28% of crypto-native media sites that managed to grow stand out from the rest. Against the backdrop of such a steep overall decline, their ability to attract and even increase their audiences is quite remarkable given the circumstances in the industry. Outset PR created a scoring system that looks at both how much these outlets grew relative to others (30%) and the total increase in their traffic (70%). This system identified the five outlets below as the growing leaders in Latin America: Data sourced from Outset PR Each of these publications managed to grow its audience while most of the sector contracted. They did mainly through creating localized content and optimizing it for both direct and organic search traffic. The Declining Majority: A Broad Downturn For most crypto-native outlets, Q2 saw a further decline in traffic. More than 70% of publishers lost visitors, continuing a downward trend that started earlier this year . This decline is particularly noticeable among the top portals. In Q1, six outlets had over 400,000 monthly visits, but by Q2, only one managed to stay above that mark. With 1.35 million visits, CriptoNoticias now makes up 16% of all crypto-related traffic in Latin America. This shows how narrow the market has become with a few publishers starting to dominate. Data sourced from Outset PR The mid-tier outlets, including Cointelegraph Brasil, Bitfinanzas, and Livecoins, still account for 57.82% of the LATAM crypto media traffic. However, even their numbers are declining. Meanwhile, other 30 smaller sites, which represent 25.75% of the LATAM crypto-related traffic, are continuing to struggle, with many finding it hard to stay relevant. Why It Matters: Adoption Grows, Media Shrinks In Q2, something interesting happened: while more people in Latin America started adopting cryptocurrency, the visibility of crypto-focused outlets dropped significantly. According to data from RankingsLatAm, the region saw an 18.3% increase in unique crypto users, with Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru making up almost 90% of that market. Stablecoins are becoming a bigger part of everyday life. For example, Visa teamed up with Bridge to offer stablecoin-linked cards, Bybit launched promotions aimed at Latin America, and Tether invested €30 million in a company called Bit2Me, with a special focus on Argentina. Argentina is also advancing its efforts in tokenization through its BA Cripto program which even allows people to pay municipal taxes using cryptocurrency. However, even as more people use crypto, the channels that usually inform users about it are becoming weaker. This disconnect is important to understand because it highlights why the decline in visibility for crypto-focused outlets matters. The industry risks losing independent voices that provide awareness and education, which is crucial for adoption. Only 32% of Latin Americans view cryptocurrency transactions as secure, and educational gaps remain, making strong media coverage essential in the region. Artificial Intelligence and Discovery: Another Growing Challenge Beyond adoption trends, Outset PR’s survey of publishers revealed another structural challenge: the impact of AI on how people discover content. Editors in the region noted that traffic from Google is declining as more users turn to AI tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity for quick answers. In Q2, referrals from AI made up 0.97% of traffic for crypto-native outlets, but they accounted for around 15% of referral traffic for many other sites. Mainstream websites are benefiting from this shift, as they have stronger domain authority and a wider reach. Data sourced from Outset PR Outset PR warns that if publishers don’t embrace AI-driven discovery using structured formats like FAQs or summaries, even those that are currently doing well could become irrelevant. To keep up, they will need to change their headlines, content formats, and distribution strategies as audiences increasingly rely on conversational AI instead of traditional search engines. This trend aligns with Outset PR’s Eastern Europe report , where artificial intelligence referrals also disrupted traffic patterns. A Regional Story, A Global Lesson The data from LATAM fits into a larger global picture that Outset PR has been tracking each quarter. Crypto-focused outlets in Western Europe faced challenges with the first wave of MiCA regulations . Eastern Europe showed mixed signs of recovery. Latin America has demonstrated, again, that just because more people are adopting crypto doesn’t mean that media portals will thrive. The Q2 research reveals a new reality: only a few outlets are surviving and growing. Out of many crypto-focused sites, just a small number are doing well, and even they have their own challenges. The ones that are succeeding aren’t guaranteed safety, while those that are struggling might disappear altogether. For strategists, PR teams, publishers, and policymakers, the key takeaway is clear: visibility is changing, and competition for attention is tougher than ever. While crypto adoption is rising, the battle for influence is now focused among fewer players, with generalist media and AI platforms increasingly determining how crypto stories reach people. For media planners, the report suggests it's time to rethink and restrategize. Outset PR recommends that planners consider breakout publishers, optimize for AI discovery, tap into mainstream audiences, address regional nuances, and diversify traffic sources. By following these steps, campaigns can gain better visibility in the current crypto media space and help brands stay strong as audience preferences have changed toward new channels and tools for finding information.",More News|Breaking News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-09-09 13:53:37

According to market analyst Walter Bloomberg, the spot price of gold recently touched a remarkable $3,660 per ounce. This monumental achievement isn’t just a number; it reflects a confluence of global economic factors and investor sentiment, highlighting gold’s enduring appeal as a safe-haven asset in uncertain times. For those tracking market trends, this surge in the gold price is a clear signal of shifting dynamics and growing demand for precious metals. What’s Driving the Unprecedented Gold Price Surge? This recent leap in the gold price can be attributed to several powerful forces at play in the global economy. Firstly, persistent inflation concerns across major economies are pushing investors towards assets that historically retain value. When the purchasing power of fiat currencies erodes, gold often shines as a reliable store of wealth. Secondly, geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties worldwide encourage a flight to safety. Gold, with its reputation as a crisis commodity, becomes an attractive option when traditional markets face volatility. Moreover, a weakening U.S. dollar can also make gold more appealing, as it becomes cheaper for holders of other currencies. Central banks globally have also been significant buyers, adding to their reserves, which further underscores the metal’s perceived value and stability. This institutional demand provides a strong foundation for the current market strength and helps explain the remarkable rise in the gold price . Gold as a Shield: Why Investors Trust Precious Metals For centuries, gold has been revered as a reliable hedge against economic instability. Its role as a safe haven is particularly evident during periods of high inflation or market turmoil. As the gold price continues its upward trajectory, many investors are re-evaluating their portfolios, considering gold’s ability to protect wealth. What makes gold such a trusted asset? Tangible Asset: Unlike paper money, gold is a physical asset with intrinsic value. Limited Supply: Its scarcity contributes to its long-term value. Global Acceptance: Gold is recognized and accepted worldwide as a form of currency and value. Historical Performance: It has historically performed well during periods of economic downturns and market volatility, offering a counterbalance to other investments. Navigating the Market: What Does This Gold Price High Mean for You? With the gold price reaching new peaks, what are the implications for individual investors and the broader market? This milestone encourages a deeper look at portfolio strategies. Here’s what this record high could mean: Inflation Hedge: Gold often acts as a robust defense against rising living costs, preserving purchasing power. Portfolio Diversification: Including gold can reduce overall risk, balancing out equity and bond holdings by offering a non-correlated asset. Demand Dynamics: Increased demand from both retail and institutional buyers is a key driver, suggesting sustained interest in precious metals. Economic Indicators: The surging gold price can signal underlying concerns about economic stability and future growth, prompting investors to seek security. However, it is crucial to remember that while gold offers stability, it is not immune to market fluctuations. Understanding the factors influencing its value is key to making informed investment decisions. The Road Ahead: What’s Next for the Gold Price? The question on many minds is whether this upward trend in the gold price is sustainable. Market analysts are closely watching various indicators, including interest rate policies from central banks, the strength of the U.S. dollar, and global economic data. While some predict continued upward momentum fueled by ongoing uncertainties, others suggest potential for consolidation. Looking forward, the trajectory of the gold price will likely depend on: Monetary Policies: How central banks manage interest rates and inflation. Geopolitical Stability: Any escalation or de-escalation of global conflicts. Economic Growth: The health of major economies and consumer confidence. Supply and Demand: Mining output versus investor and industrial demand. Regardless, gold’s performance reinforces its unique position in the financial landscape. Its ability to command such a high valuation in today’s environment is a testament to its enduring allure and perceived security. Conclusion: The astonishing surge in the gold price to an unprecedented $3,660 per ounce marks a significant moment in financial markets. This record-breaking achievement underscores gold’s role as a vital asset, particularly in times of economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures. For investors and market watchers alike, understanding the drivers behind this surge and its potential implications is crucial. Gold continues to prove its mettle, offering a glimmer of stability in an often unpredictable world. Frequently Asked Questions About the Gold Price Surge What is the new all-time high for gold? The spot price of gold recently reached an unprecedented all-time high of $3,660 per ounce, as reported by Walter Bloomberg. What factors are contributing to the rising gold price? Several factors are driving the surge, including persistent global inflation concerns, geopolitical tensions, economic uncertainties, and increased demand from central banks and investors seeking safe-haven assets. Is gold a good investment during inflation? Historically, gold has been considered a strong hedge against inflation. It tends to retain its value or even appreciate when the purchasing power of fiat currencies declines. How does the gold price impact my investment portfolio? A rising gold price can positively impact portfolios that include precious metals, offering diversification and a potential buffer against volatility in other asset classes like stocks and bonds. Should I invest in gold now that it’s at an all-time high? Investment decisions should always be based on individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and thorough research. While gold offers unique benefits, it’s advisable to consult with a financial advisor to determine if it aligns with your strategy.

But even as Solana retests critical levels, a growing cohort of investors is turning their attention to emerging PayFi altcoins like Remittix (RTX) . With a wallet beta set to launch on September 15 and a $250,000 giveaway attracting massive buzz, Remittix is drawing comparisons to early Solana momentum. Solana Price Prediction Eyes Breakout As Accumulation Peaks The current Solana price prediction indicates a bullish structure as Solana is currently trading at $213. According to analysts, SOL has completed a 504-day accumulation phase, a fractal pattern that previously preceded parabolic rallies. Institutional flows are also contributing to upside pressure. This week, Folius Ventures added $600,000 worth of SOL via dollar-cost averaging, reinforcing long-term confidence. Technically, Solana is tracking well above its 200-day exponential moving average, with pressure escalating inside a symmetrical triangle. A breakout higher over $213 could target the $240 to $250 range. If this historical configuration is likely to repeat, analysts put a longer-term rally to $500 on the table, mirroring past post-accumulation cycles. Why Remittix Is Capturing Solana-Style Attention In PayFi While Solana continues its fight at resistance, Remittix is quietly climbing crypto watchlists for very different reasons. Positioned as a PayFi solution for real-world transactions, Remittix enables crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries, directly appealing to freelancers, merchants, and borderless earners. With over $24.5 million raised, more than 651 million tokens sold, and a current price of $0.1050, Remittix has surpassed multiple key milestones. All eyes are now on its Q3 wallet beta scheduled for September 15, which supports over 40 cryptos and 30 fiat currencies. The following factors are boosting confidence in Remittix’s bullish outlook: Cross-Border Solution In Real Time : Users can send crypto, and the recipient receives fiat in their bank account instantly, with no conversion loss or crypto knowledge needed. Wallet Beta Launches This Month : The Remittix wallet, going live in September, is set to support 40+ cryptos and offers seamless PayFi integrations. Trusted Infrastructure Already Built : The platform’s backend is already processing internal test transactions, showing actual product readiness before TGE. Token Utility Anchored In Real Payments : The RTX token is not built for speculation; it underpins gas fees and settlement layers for Remittix’s PayFi network. Audited By CertiK For Maximum Trust : The platform has passed security audits, ensuring investors and users can interact with confidence. Conclusion Solana price prediction models remain optimistic. But many retail and strategic investors are now balancing their portfolios with utility-led newcomers. Remittix stands out in that category. With confirmed listings, a working product, and real momentum, analysts believe its growth curve could eclipse Solana’s early days. For those seeking the next major breakout, Remittix may offer the most asymmetric upside of 2025.

As part of this transition, Sonic plans to introduce new features to increase community engagement and enhance its ecosystem’s utility, which could drive demand for its token. However, the price of FTM is expected to remain largely influenced by overall market sentiment and the platform’s adoption rate. The success of this rebranding will likely depend on how effectively Sonic aligns with the crypto market’s growing focus on regulatory compliance. Will Sonic (Prev.FTM) reclaim FTM’s all-time high of $3.48 soon? How high can Sonic (S) go in 2025? Let’s dive into Sonic’s price predictions for 2025 and beyond.

Key support lies near $0.291, while resistance sits at $0.343. A break above resistance could encourage a push higher, while failure to hold support risks further downside.

On the 1-day chart, Sonic (prev FTM) is consolidating around $0.309, with candles struggling to hold above the mid-Bollinger Band. RSI at 47 signals neutral momentum, while MACD remains slightly bearish, hinting at limited buying strength. A push above $0.317 could open room toward $0.343, but failure risks sliding back to $0.291 support. On the 4-hour chart, the price mirrors this indecision, hovering near the middle band of Bollinger Bands with flat MACD readings and weak Balance of Power. Bulls need volume to reclaim $0.323 for short-term upside, while bears could retest $0.294 if momentum stays weak. Is Sonic a good investment? Sonic is a high-speed, scalable blockchain platform gaining attention as an alternative to networks like Ethereum. Based on our analysis, we are optimistic about its growth, projecting a $0.5405 price by 2025 and $3.46 by 2030. Despite its potential, investing in Sonic (S) involves risks typical of cryptocurrencies, including market volatility. Own research and assessing personal risk tolerance are essential for anyone considering S as a potential investment opportunity. Will Sonic reach $5? The price of Sonic could reach $2.88 by 2030, with price predictions suggesting a high of $3.46. However, achieving this depends on market conditions and overall blockchain adoption trends. Will Sonic reach $10? Based on our technical analysis, Sonic will not approach double-digit prices within the next 6 years. Our recent Sonic predictions suggest that by 2031, S could attain a price of about $4.97. Is Sonic a safe network? Sonic is regarded as a secure blockchain platform that utilizes its unique Lachesis consensus mechanism for high-speed and scalable transactions. However, as with any blockchain network, users should exercise caution, use official channels, and follow best security practices to protect their assets. Does Sonic have a good, long-term future? Sonic shows potential for a strong long-term future, with price predictions suggesting significant growth by 2030 and beyond. Analysts forecast prices could reach between $3.46 and $4.97, driven by its unique blockchain technology and increasing adoption in decentralized applications. However, market volatility remains a concern. Recent news/opinion on Sonic (prev.

While the S&P 500 climbed 0.09% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.21%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced a slight dip of 0.01%. This immediate divergence in stock market performance sets a complex stage for investors, prompting crucial questions about underlying economic signals and future trends, particularly for those keeping an eye on the broader financial landscape, including cryptocurrencies. Understanding Today’s Mixed Stock Market Performance The initial movements across the three primary U.S. indexes offer a glimpse into varying investor sentiment. Each index represents a different segment of the economy, and their individual performance can signal shifting priorities or concerns. S&P 500: This index tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. Its modest gain often indicates broad, albeit cautious, market confidence. Nasdaq Composite: Known for its heavy concentration of technology and growth stocks, Nasdaq’s upward movement suggests continued optimism in the tech sector. Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA): Comprising 30 large, well-established “blue-chip” companies, the Dow’s slight decline could reflect minor profit-taking or concerns in traditional industrial sectors. This nuanced stock market performance highlights the dynamic interplay of economic forces at play. What Drives Such Varied Stock Market Performance? Why do we see such contrasting movements among these powerful indexes? Several factors contribute to this phenomenon, constantly shaping the overall stock market performance . Economic Data: Inflation reports, employment figures, and consumer spending data heavily influence investor decisions. Positive news in one area might boost certain sectors while negative data could drag others down. Corporate Earnings: Strong earnings reports from major tech companies, for instance, can propel the Nasdaq, even if other sectors face headwinds. Conversely, weaker earnings can lead to broader market cautiousness. Interest Rate Expectations: The Federal Reserve’s stance on interest rates significantly impacts borrowing costs and future economic growth, influencing how investors value different assets. Geopolitical Events: Global stability, trade policies, and international conflicts can introduce uncertainty, causing investors to shift capital between sectors or even different asset classes. Understanding these drivers is essential for making informed investment choices. Navigating Volatility: Strategies for Prudent Investors In a market exhibiting mixed signals, prudent investors adopt strategies designed to manage risk and capitalize on opportunities. Navigating fluctuating stock market performance requires a thoughtful approach. Consider these actionable insights: Diversification: Spreading investments across various asset classes and sectors can mitigate risk. If one area underperforms, others might compensate. Long-Term Perspective: Short-term market fluctuations are a normal part of investing. Focusing on long-term goals helps avoid emotional decisions based on daily movements. Stay Informed: Regularly monitoring economic news, company reports, and expert analysis provides crucial context for market movements. However, avoid impulsive reactions to every headline. Rebalance Your Portfolio: Periodically adjusting your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level is a wise practice, especially when market conditions shift. These strategies help investors maintain resilience amidst market uncertainty. The Crypto Connection: How Stock Market Performance Influences Digital Assets While the initial news focuses on traditional indexes, the ripple effects of stock market performance often extend into the cryptocurrency realm. Many investors view digital assets through the lens of broader market sentiment. Risk-On/Risk-Off Sentiment: When traditional markets are perceived as “risk-on” (investors are willing to take more risks), capital might flow into growth stocks and potentially higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, during “risk-off” periods, investors might pull back, impacting crypto valuations. Correlation with Tech Stocks: Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, has often shown a correlation with tech-heavy indexes like the Nasdaq. When tech stocks perform well, Bitcoin sometimes follows suit, and vice versa. Macroeconomic Indicators: Factors like inflation and interest rate hikes, which influence traditional markets, also play a significant role in how investors perceive the value and future of decentralized assets. Understanding this interplay helps crypto enthusiasts anticipate potential movements in their digital portfolios. Conclusion: A Dynamic Landscape Demands Vigilance Today’s mixed opening for the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones Industrial Average underscores the complex and ever-evolving nature of financial markets. This diverse stock market performance serves as a reminder that no single indicator tells the whole story. Investors, whether focused on traditional stocks or digital assets, must remain vigilant, informed, and strategic in their approach. The ability to interpret these varied signals and adapt investment strategies is key to navigating the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead in this dynamic economic landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does “mixed opening” mean for the stock market? A1: A “mixed opening” means that while some major stock indexes are trading higher, others are trading lower. For example, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq might be up, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down, as seen today. Q2: Why do different indexes perform differently on the same day? A2: Different indexes track different types of companies or sectors. The Nasdaq is tech-heavy, while the Dow focuses on industrial giants. Economic news, corporate earnings, or specific sector developments can impact these indexes differently, leading to varied performance. Q3: How does the stock market performance affect the cryptocurrency market? A3: The cryptocurrency market often shows correlation with traditional stock markets, particularly tech stocks. During periods of high investor confidence (“risk-on”), both tend to perform well. Conversely, during “risk-off” periods, investors might pull back from riskier assets, impacting crypto. Q4: Should I be concerned about a slight dip in the Dow Jones? A4: A slight dip, like 0.01%, is generally considered minimal and part of normal market fluctuations. It’s more important to look at broader trends and the context of other market indicators rather than reacting to minor daily movements. Q5: What are “risk-on” and “risk-off” sentiments? A5: “Risk-on” sentiment describes periods when investors are confident and willing to invest in higher-risk assets for potentially greater returns. “Risk-off” sentiment occurs when investors become cautious, selling riskier assets and moving towards safer investments like government bonds or cash. Q6: Is diversification only for traditional stock investors? A6: No, diversification is a crucial strategy for all types of investors, including those in the cryptocurrency market. Spreading investments across different digital assets, or even across traditional and digital assets, can help manage risk and potentially improve returns. Share Your Insights!

Speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Anton Kobyakov framed crypto and gold as “alternative currencies” to the dollar-centric system and argued that Washington aims to harness them to address what he called a crisis of confidence in the greenback. “Right now, the United States is trying to change the rules on the gold and cryptocurrency markets. Just think about their debt – $35 trillion. These are two alternative currencies to the global market,” Kobyakov said.He added: “Washington’s actions in this direction clearly demonstrate one of the main American goals. They want to solve the problem of lowering the dollar’s trust. The United States, as it was in the 1930s and 1970s, will solve its financial problems at the expense of the whole world, driving everyone into the cryptocurrency cloud.” Kobyakov’s most arresting claim was operational: “Over time, when part of the US government debt is placed in stablecoins, the US will devalue this debt. In other words, they have a $35 trillion debt, they drive it into the cryptocurrency cloud, devalue it and start from scratch.” The remarks, which were circulated by Russian state-adjacent outlets, did not include a detailed mechanism for how “placing” sovereign obligations into stablecoins would alter their real value. Russia just accused the US of using crypto to wipe out its $35T debt. Putin’s adviser Kobyakov says Washington will shove debt into stablecoins, devalue it, and reset the system. pic.twitter.com/IwmiLYp2ic — TFTC (@TFTC21) September 8, 2025 Can Bitcoin And Crypto (Stablecoins) Erase The US Debt? The accusation lands amid two relevant backdrops: a US debt load now measured in the mid-$30 trillions and a fast-expanding stablecoin and tokenized-Treasury ecosystem that nonetheless remains orders of magnitude smaller than public debt. Treasury data and Congressional dashboards put gross federal debt at roughly $37.4 trillion in early September, with about $30.1 trillion held by the public. By contrast, the entire stablecoin market stands in the high-$200 billions, and tokenized US Treasury products total about $7.4 billion—hardly a platform capable of “absorbing” sovereign liabilities at scale. US policy developments complicate Kobyakov’s narrative in another way. In July, President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act , the first federal framework for payment stablecoins. The law requires 100% reserve backing in cash and short-term Treasuries and mandates regular public disclosures—design choices that, if anything, tie stablecoin growth to incremental demand for Treasury bills rather than a mechanism for extinguishing US obligations. That is, more regulated stablecoins typically mean more private-sector buying of T-bills to back those tokens, not fewer Treasuries outstanding. Kobyakov’s historical analogy—invoking the 1930s and 1970s—references episodes when US authorities changed the monetary regime: FDR’s dollar devaluation against gold in 1933–34 and Nixon’s 1971 closure of the gold window. But translating that precedent into a “stablecoin devaluation” is tenuous. Stablecoins are issued by private or specially licensed entities and are designed to be redeemed at par; moving government liabilities “into” them would neither novate the debt nor change its legal terms. Any genuine devaluation of dollar-denominated debt would still occur via familiar channels—higher inflation, negative real rates, buybacks at discounts, or maturity transformation—not by wrapping the debt in token form. Beyond the stablecoin debate, Washington has already sketched an alternative pathway: a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. On March 6, 2025, the White House issued an executive order establishing a federal bitcoin reserve alongside a US Digital Asset Stockpile to manage government-owned crypto (largely from forfeitures) on a long-term, “budget-neutral” basis ; companion legislation—the BITCOIN Act introduced in both chambers—would codify governance and disclosure rules. US President Donald Trump himself has floated the idea in blunt terms. In an Aug. 2024 Fox Business interview with Maria Bartiromo, he mused: “Who knows? Maybe we’ll pay off our $35 trillion, hand them a little crypto check, right? We’ll hand them a little Bitcoin and wipe out our $35 trillion.” The remark was rhetorical rather than an operational plan, but it prefigured the administration’s March 6, 2025 executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

With XRP showing signs of volatility and uncertainty surrounding its next major price direction, the analyst’s cautionary message serves as a reminder for traders to stay vigilant and patient. The Trap XRP Investors Need To Avoid Hilton recently shared a video report on X social media, cautioning XRP holders about a common trap that they often fall into during extended consolidation phases. He explained that XRP has been trading sideways within a narrow range of $2.80 and $3.30 for roughly 48 days now. While some investors may interpret this stagnation as a sign of weakness or lack of future potential, Hilton argues the opposite. Related Reading: XRP Price Could See 20% Bounce To $3.4 If This Trendline Holds According to him, periods of consolidation should not be viewed as setbacks but as essential, healthy stages in an asset’s price cycle and long-term growth. Drawing on his 30 years of investment experience, Hilton noted that both stocks and cryptocurrencies naturally progress through phases of upward surges, corrections, and sideways movement. He added that the real risk comes when investors misinterpret a consolidation phase as the end of growth, leading them to prematurely sell their holdings out of boredom, frustration, or anxiety. The analyst further emphasized that sideways trading in cryptocurrencies is often a precursor to significant upward moves. He highlighted XRP’s performance earlier in July, when, after a similar period of consolidation, the altcoin rallied by more than 61%. To him, this serves as evidence that XRP uses these quiet pullback periods to build strong support levels before advancing to higher price ranges. Building on this point, Hilton advised new and inexperienced investors not to fall for the consolidation trick and abandon their positions, as doing so could mean missing out on potential gains. He also reminded holders that external market events such as the upcoming FOMC Meeting could act as a catalyst for a price breakout after extended periods of calm. Expert Predicts XRP Explosive Surge To $6 In other news, crypto market expert Gordon offered a bold projection for XRP’s price trajectory, predicting a potentially rapid surge to $6. He observed that XRP has been consolidating at its current level for months, suggesting that it is preparing for a strong breakout to new all-time highs. Related Reading: XRP To Surpass Bitcoin? Pundit Reveals What Will Drive The Takeover The analyst’s monthly chart supports his bullish outlook. It shows steady upward momentum, with increasingly larger candlesticks that reflect strong buying pressure and renewed confidence among investors. Despite seeing a slight surge from the $2.8 range to $2.95, at the time of writing, XRP would still have to rally by approximately 103% to reach the projected $6 target. Fortunately, the explosive candle highlighted in Gordon’s chart demonstrates that the altcoin has entered a stage where price accelerations could happen swiftly.

Traders are watching closely to see if XRP can push higher or risk slipping further. Yet while Ripple’s asset treads water, Remittix has stolen the conversation with analysts framing it as a PayFi token priced at $0.1050 per token, that could deliver a 20–40x breakout. This shift has drawn fresh investor attention as momentum builds around upcoming listings and product launches. XRP Price Around $2.80 Source: TradingView The XRP price prediction has become one of the most debated subjects in the altcoin market. Currently trading at $2.88, XRP has been holding its fragile base above $2.84 support while testing the short-term resistance zone near $2.92–$2.93. On-chain flows point to inflows of $9.28 million on September 8, the first significant rise in weeks, indicating re-accumulation. Momentum signals indicate cautious optimism. RSI stands at 59 and is performing well, whereas MACD is flattening, showing the possibility of a trend change. If XRP manages to surpass the $2.93 level decisively, the path to $3.20 will be open. But if the $2.80 zone gives way, the next stop could be $2.70, leaving traders on edge. Remittix Attracts Whales With 20–40x Speculation While the XRP price prediction suggests sideways pressure, whales have started to shift toward Remittix, which has raised over $24.5 million through the sale of 651 million tokens at $0.1050 each. With its PayFi focus, Remittix is pitched as a rare growth opportunity in 2025, blending utility with speed and accessibility. Analysts believe this is why it has been dubbed by some as the next XRP. Here are some fresh reasons traders see Remittix as a standout contender: Backed by strong community-driven social metrics with rising X/Twitter mentions Strategic partnerships in the pipeline for banking and fintech integration Mobile wallet beta launch set for September 15, promising real-world adoption Further centralized exchange listings reveal expected once the $25M milestone is cleared $250,000 giveaway campaign active, boosting both awareness and early user traction Why The Spotlight Is Moving From XRP To Remittix The XRP price prediction offers modest upside near-term, but limited inflows show hesitation among large players. By contrast, Remittix has quickly become a magnet for speculation with clear timelines, growing adoption, and credible 20–40x upside potential. For investors looking beyond consolidation, Remittix is positioning itself not just as another token but as the PayFi altcoin narrative of 2025.

While September and October are being pointed to at this point, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas has given an exact date for Dogecoin (DOGE). Accordingly, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said that RexShares' spot Dogecoin ETF will be launched on the 11th. The fund relies on the Investment Company Act of 1940, which provides for automatic approval approximately 75 days after application, unless there are special circumstances. “The meme coin ETF era appears to be about to begin; DOJE is scheduled to launch on Thursday, but under Law 40, like SSK. There's still a large group of Act '33 members waiting for SEC approval. I'm pretty sure this is the first U.S. ETF that knowingly holds something it doesn't benefit from.” While Eric Balchunas is quite confident about the DOGE ETF, Santiment analyst Brian Q. made a bold prediction for the soon-to-be-launched Rex-Osprey Dogecoin ETF. In his latest analysis, Brian wrote that the REX-Osprey Dogecoin ETF, codenamed DOJE, will soon receive approval to launch. He claimed there was a 93% chance of approval this week.

51449590,https://finbold.com/?p=252857,1757426710,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,China’s fintech ambitions drive interest in Venom Blockchain,https://finbold.com/chinas-fintech-ambitions-drive-interest-in-venom-blockchain/,"Reports from Toutiao indicate that a leading Chinese fintech company is in discussions to acquire blockchain technology from the Venom Foundation. While details of the negotiations remain confidential, sources suggest the goal is to integrate Venom’s infrastructure into financial services that support the real economy, from supply chain finance to cross-border settlements. The talks echo a familiar pattern. Chinese companies have a track record of moving into blockchain and digital asset sectors through bold acquisitions or strategic pivots, triggering market reactions. One notable case came from the crypto exchange Huobi, which pursued a strategy of overseas acquisitions starting in 2018, buying licenses and platforms in Japan and Singapore after Beijing tightened domestic regulation. The strategy enabled Huobi to maintain a global presence despite restrictions at home, though it also underlined how Chinese players often rely on foreign partnerships to keep pace with global innovation. Venom employs dynamic sharding to handle high transaction volumes and bottlenecks, a fair-ordering layer to address market manipulation issues, and cross-chain interoperability with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Web Assembly (WASM). However, analysts note that supply chain finance would benefit the most from Venom’s blockchain-based data credit system. Potential applications are wide-ranging. Supply chain finance has long been a bottleneck for small and medium-sized enterprises, where banks hesitate to extend credit due to limited data. Blockchain could help build a transparent “data credit” system to reduce that gap. For investors, the possible Venom deal raises familiar questions. Could it mirror Huobi’s experience, where overseas acquisitions became the foundation for long-term strategy despite regulatory headwinds? The negotiations are expected to extend into late 2025 or early 2026. Regardless of the outcome, the story reflects a broader structural shift: blockchain is steadily moving into the infrastructure layer of China’s financial system.

A group of 12 U.S. Senate Democrats has just unveiled a significant framework for US crypto market regulation . This move aims to bring much-needed clarity and robust protection to the rapidly evolving digital asset space, signaling a serious commitment to shaping its future. What’s Driving This New Era of US Crypto Market Regulation? The digital asset landscape has grown exponentially, but with that growth comes a pressing need for clear guidelines. For too long, the crypto market has operated in a regulatory gray area, leading to uncertainty for innovators and, crucially, risks for everyday investors. This new framework, as reported by The Block, represents a concerted effort to address these challenges head-on. The core motivation behind this initiative is to foster a stable and trustworthy environment. By establishing clearer rules, the Senate Democrats hope to: Encourage responsible innovation within the United States. Attract institutional investment with greater confidence. Most importantly, safeguard consumers from potential harms. Key Proposals Shaping the Future of US Crypto Market Regulation This comprehensive framework introduces several critical proposals designed to create a more structured and secure market. These aren’t just minor tweaks; they represent fundamental shifts in how digital assets could be overseen. Let’s explore some of the most impactful ideas: CFTC Authority Over Spot Markets: The framework suggests granting the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) primary authority over spot markets for digital assets deemed ‘non-security’ tokens. This could provide a clearer regulatory home for many cryptocurrencies currently in limbo. Clear Security Determination Process: One of the biggest debates in crypto is whether a token is a security or not. The framework proposes establishing a clear, standardized process to determine whether a digital asset falls under securities law or commodity law, offering much-needed legal certainty. Enhanced Disclosure Requirements: Token issuers would face stronger disclosure requirements. This means more transparency for investors about a project’s fundamentals, risks, and governance, empowering them to make informed decisions. Tailored Regulations for Exchanges and Custodians: The proposal calls for specific, customized regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges and custodians. This aims to ensure these critical service providers operate with robust standards for security, operational integrity, and financial stability. Preventing Market Manipulation: Stricter standards are envisioned to actively prevent market manipulation and other illicit activities. This is crucial for maintaining fair and orderly markets and protecting investors from unfair practices. How Will This Framework Enhance Consumer Trust and Market Integrity? At its heart, this proposed US crypto market regulation is about building trust. The past few years have seen numerous high-profile incidents that eroded public confidence in the crypto space. This framework directly targets those vulnerabilities. By mandating enhanced disclosures, investors will gain access to vital information, reducing the chances of being misled by opaque projects. Think of it as putting more labels on products so you know exactly what you’re buying. Furthermore, tailored regulations for exchanges and custodians are designed to prevent the kind of spectacular failures that have rocked the industry. These rules would likely focus on capital requirements, segregation of customer assets, and robust cybersecurity measures. The goal is to ensure that platforms handling your digital assets are reliable and secure. The emphasis on preventing market manipulation is equally vital. This could involve stricter surveillance and enforcement mechanisms to detect and punish activities like pump-and-dumps or wash trading, creating a level playing field for all participants in the US crypto market regulation landscape. What Are the Potential Impacts and Challenges Ahead? This framework, while promising, is just the beginning. The path to full implementation will undoubtedly involve significant debate and negotiation. There will be challenges, including: Political Hurdles: Gaining bipartisan support in a divided Congress will be crucial, and potentially difficult. Industry Pushback: Some in the crypto industry may resist certain regulations, arguing they stifle innovation. Implementation Complexity: Crafting the specific rules and enforcement mechanisms will be a massive undertaking for regulatory bodies. However, the opportunities presented by clear US crypto market regulation are substantial. It could solidify the U.S. as a leader in the digital asset space, fostering a more mature and resilient market. This clarity could unlock significant institutional investment, drive innovation, and ultimately provide a safer environment for millions of Americans engaging with digital assets. In conclusion, the release of this framework by Senate Democrats marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. It signals a serious, coordinated effort to bring structure, protection, and clarity to a rapidly evolving financial frontier. While the journey to full implementation will be complex, the direction is clear: toward a more regulated, more secure, and ultimately, more trustworthy digital asset ecosystem in the United States. This is a crucial step for the future of US crypto market regulation . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Who released this new crypto market regulation framework? A group of 12 U.S. Senate Democrats released the framework for cryptocurrency market structure in the United States. What is the main goal of this proposed US crypto market regulation? The primary goal is to bring clarity, enhance consumer protection, prevent market manipulation, and establish clear regulatory oversight for digital assets in the U.S. What role would the CFTC play under this framework? The framework proposes granting the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) authority over spot markets for non-security tokens, clarifying its jurisdiction in the crypto space. How does the framework aim to protect consumers? It calls for strengthening disclosure requirements for token issuers, creating tailored regulations for exchanges and custodians, and enhancing standards to prevent market manipulation, all designed to safeguard investors. What is the significance of establishing a process to determine if a digital asset is a security? This process is crucial for resolving the long-standing debate between the SEC and CFTC over crypto jurisdiction, providing legal certainty for token issuers and market participants, and guiding future US crypto market regulation.

51449617,https://timestabloid.com/?p=82524,1757426718,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Predicts XRP and Cardano (ADA) Prices for End of 2025,https://timestabloid.com/expert-predicts-xrp-and-cardano-ada-prices-for-end-of-2025/,"Renowned market analyst Ash Crypto has projected ambitious price ranges for leading cryptocurrencies by the end of 2025. In a recent post on X, he forecasted XRP trading between $5 and $8 and Cardano’s ADA between $3 and $5. These targets signal strong confidence in the potential of both assets to capitalize on expanding adoption and innovation in the digital asset space. XRP’s Path Toward $5–$8 At present, XRP trades near the $3 mark, making Ash Crypto’s prediction a significant upside scenario. The strength of the forecast lies in several key developments surrounding Ripple and its ecosystem. The introduction of RLUSD, Ripple’s U.S. dollar stablecoin , launched in December 2024, is creating new liquidity dynamics on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This stablecoin serves as a key entry point for institutions and payment providers, enabling smoother transactions and international use. Institutional interest in digital assets has also been accelerating. With XRP positioned as one of the most established settlement tokens, an influx of capital from funds, custodians, and payment platforms could drive increased demand. Combined with growing adoption of on-chain products, XRP’s liquidity profile and utility base give weight to Ash Crypto’s $5–$8 forecast. My 2025 price predictions $BTC – $150k-$200k $ETH – $7,500-$12,000 $LINK – $60-$100 $XRP – $5-$8 $BNB – $1500-$2000 $ADA – $3-$5 $DOGE – $1-$2 $SOL – $400-500 $SUI – $10-15 $DOT – $10-$15 $TON – $8-12 $WLFI – $0.50-$0.80 $ONDO – $3-$5 Drop yours below, I’m reading — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) September 8, 2025 Cardano’s Journey to $3–$5 Cardano has an aggressive development plan that aligns with Ash Crypto’s forecast of ADA hitting $3–$5 by late 2025. The network continues to emphasize scalability and governance upgrades as it transitions through key phases of development. Hydra , Cardano’s state-channel scaling solution, is central to this progress. If fully realized, it could dramatically expand transaction throughput, enabling the network to support larger volumes of decentralized applications and DeFi projects. Additionally, Cardano’s Voltaire governance era aims to decentralize decision-making, ensuring that future upgrades and funding are community-driven. This self-sustaining governance model, coupled with robust developer activity, positions Cardano to remain competitive within the broader blockchain ecosystem. For ADA to reach the projected price range, these technological milestones must convert into meaningful user adoption, rising transaction volumes, and a broader base of real-world applications. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Key Risks and Considerations Despite the optimism surrounding these forecasts, both assets face risks that could limit their upside. For XRP, the pace of RLUSD adoption and the willingness of institutions to expand into XRPL-based liquidity solutions will be decisive. For Cardano, the gap between theoretical scalability and tangible user engagement remains a challenge; without substantial developer traction and user participation, ADA’s value growth may lag expectations. Broader market conditions also play a critical role. Global liquidity cycles, interest rate policies, and Bitcoin’s price leadership will shape the trajectory of all digital assets, including XRP and ADA. Forward Outlook Ash Crypto’s predictions for XRP and Cardano highlight two different but equally ambitious growth paths. XRP’s road to $5–$8 is anchored in liquidity innovation and institutional participation, while Cardano’s journey to $3–$5 depends on the successful rollout of its scalability solutions and governance framework. Both forecasts should be treated as directional benchmarks, guiding attention toward key adoption signals and ecosystem growth metrics that will determine whether these bold targets can be realized by the end of 2025.

Tether Surpasses Mid-Tier ETFs With Bitcoin Purchases USDT stablecoin issuer Tether has become one of the largest corporate buyers of Bitcoin over the past 12 months, adding more than 27,700 BTC to its reserves — surpassing the holdings of several spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to CEO Paolo Ardoino. About 7,900 BTC were placed directly in reserves to back USDT, while another 19,800 BTC were transferred to the Twenty One Capital (XXI) digital asset fund, co-invested by Tether. This strategy allowed the company to outpace mid-tier ETFs such as VanEck HODL, Bitwise BITB, Ark 21Shares ARKB, and WisdomTree BTCW in purchase volumes. Despite Tether’s growth, major market players remain ahead. BlackRock IBIT added 394,600 BTC, Grayscale Mini Bitcoin Trust 44,200 BTC, and Fidelity FBTC 27,900 BTC. Company Allocates Profits to Bitcoin and Secures Long-Term Resilience Ardoino explained that Tether combines stablecoin support with long-term investment positions: ”We combine the backing of a stablecoin with an investment approach that includes Bitcoin, gold, and real estate. This allows Tether to remain resilient even in volatile markets.” Tether began systematically purchasing Bitcoin in May 2023, committing to allocate 15% of quarterly profits to the cryptocurrency. This policy makes Tether one of the few major corporate players to officially invest a portion of profits in Bitcoin. Currently, Tether's total Bitcoin reserves stand at 100,521 BTC , or approximately $11.32 billion at the time of writing. According to Bitcoin Treasuries , this makes the company the third-largest corporate Bitcoin owner globally , behind Strategy and Block.one.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|USDT|BTG|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-09 14:06:19

A combination of sector-wide momentum, strong community developments, and fresh exchange activity has placed ai16z in the spotlight and fueled growing investor interest. AI tokens surge The artificial intelligence (AI) token sector has been one of the standout performers in September. According to recent data from CoinMarketCap, the market capitalisation of AI tokens rebounded nearly 11% this month, climbing to $33.9 billion. Daily trading volumes have also surged by more than 120% to $8.8 billion, showing how quickly retail and institutional attention has returned to the space. Worldcoin (WLD) has played a critical role in sparking this renewed momentum. The WLD token has rallied strongly after breaking above the $1 mark following a $250 million corporate treasury strategy announced by Eightco Holdings. A further $20 million investment by BitMine added fuel to the rally. Notably, these back-to-back moves pushed Worldcoin to $2 and helped ignite rallies in other AI-linked tokens. While CoinMarketCap does not formally classify Worldcoin as an AI project, investor sentiment has clearly shifted in favour of AI-themed tokens. ai16z, together with peers such as ARKM, KAITO, and VIRTUAL, has recorded average weekly gains of around 30%, placing it among the sector’s best performers. ai16z price surge At the time of writing, ai16z trades at $0.1193, up more than 19% over the past 24 hours. The token’s 24-hour trading range ranges between $0.099 and $0.128, supported by heavy daily volumes of more than $269 million. From a historical perspective, ai16z remains well below its all-time high of $2.47 reached in January, but it has also risen sharply from its all-time low of just above one cent recorded in November. The token’s investor sentiment is being supported by a wave of positive developments. A tweet from Hussain Zulfiqar highlighted key partnerships around ai16z’s Eliza OS, including collaboration with Farcaster as a leading AI agent and recognition from Grayscale as the foremost AI agent on Solana. Notably, the token is also being bridged to the Base ecosystem, giving it cross-chain potential. Developer activity also remains high, with its GitHub repository amassing over 3,500 stars, signalling genuine adoption. In addition, speculation about upcoming listings has further added to the bullish outlook. Zulfiqar suggested that ai16z could soon secure listings on Upbit and Binance, both of which have been major catalysts for other AI tokens such as OPEN and FLOCK. These two tokens saw surges of more than 100% following their exchange debuts, raising expectations that ai16z could follow a similar trajectory if listed.

The government has approved a five-year crypto trading pilot, locking in what 17 million Vietnamese have already been doing behind the scenes. Per a statement on the government website, this is a full-scale, government-backed push into regulated crypto trading after years of operating in the dark. Every exchange under this trial must be Vietnamese-owned. No foreign company is allowed to run platforms. Issuing, trading, and paying for crypto must all happen in Vietnamese dong. Only Vietnamese companies can issue crypto assets, and even then, they can only offer them to foreign investors. Locals can trade, but they can’t issue. Government sets capital rules and foreign ownership limits There’s a massive barrier to entry. Anyone looking to start an exchange in Vietnam must bring a minimum capital of 10 trillion dong, that’s around $379 million. Out of that, at least 65% must come from institutional investors. Even with that much money on the line, foreign investors can’t take control. They’re capped at 49% ownership of any crypto trading business. The government knows exactly what it’s walking into. Last year, Vietnam ranked fifth in the world in crypto adoption, based on data from Chainalysis. People aren’t waiting for permission. The market already holds over $100 billion in digital assets, according to Vietnam Investment Review. The state is just catching up. To get things moving, Vietnamese crypto holders and foreign investors will be allowed to open new accounts under the legal framework. But there’s a deadline coming. Six months after the first license is issued, all trades made by Vietnamese users on unlicensed exchanges will be considered illegal. The government hasn’t said what kind of penalties it will slap on rule breakers. But that clock will be ticking. In June, Vietnam’s parliament passed a new law officially recognizing digital assets starting January 2026. This law marks a clean break from past policy, when the central bank and other state agencies kept warning people to stay far away from crypto. The turnaround is clear. Officials now see blockchain, crypto, and digital infrastructure as one of eleven tech areas that could help push the country toward double-digit economic growth. One deal is already in motion. Dunamu, the company behind Upbit, signed a memorandum of understanding with Vietnam’s Military Bank last month. The agreement will let the bank build a crypto exchange in Vietnam, using Upbit’s tech. That transfer is already underway. Still, not everything is on the table. Bitcoin and other “virtual currencies” are not legal tender in Vietnam, and the government hasn’t announced any plans to change that. But officials are looking at a workaround. The idea is to build sandbox mechanisms; special zones with looser regulations. These sandboxes are part of bigger plans to create international financial centers in Danang and Ho Chi Minh City. That means crypto could play a key role in Vietnam’s financial sector from the ground up. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This comes with the potential acquisition of Venom Foundation's blockchain infrastructure , which is known for its robust, scalable, and regulatory-compliant technology. In a move that might strengthen China's climate finance capabilities, the discussions around this acquisition underline the pivotal role blockchain technology could play in achieving the country's sustainability and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reporting goals. Additional ventures by Chinese companies, like Bit Origin's recent adoption of Dogecoin, further the case for blockchain's expanding footprint in China's financial strategies. Learn more about Bit Origin's strategy . Technical Prowess of the Venom Blockchain The Venom blockchain is not just another player in the field; its capabilities are profound. Producing results with a throughput capacity of up to 150,000 transactions per second and settlements times below three seconds, Venom stands out as an advanced solution for heavy-duty environmental data handling and real-time analytics. Its technological framework is well-suited to support a variety of environmental applications, especially in constructing reliable carbon credit registries and facilitating robust environmental risk assessments in collaboration with artificial intelligence. Strategic Impact of Blockchain in China’s Global Environmental Initiatives China's interest in blockchain-enhanced green finance is not an isolated strategy. It aligns with broader national efforts like significant investments in renewable energy by the State Grid Corporation of China and strategic overseas acquisitions by China Three Gorges Corporation to bolster its clean-energy portfolio. Discover more about China's clean-energy acquisitions . The potential integration of Venom's blockchain into China's climate finance framework could be transformative, enabling the country to monitor and meet its 2030 carbon peak commitments and shape the international ESG standards. This move could solidify China’s position in leading the charge towards a sustainable financial ecosystem globally. With anticipated final talks around the acquisition slated for between late 2025 and early 2026, the Venom acquisition could mark a significant milestone in China's quest to link financial practices with sustainable development outcomes. Conclusion: As blockchain technology continues to evolve from niche to mainstream applications, its role in critical sectors like finance, particularly in the alignment with climate-related objectives, becomes more apparent. For China, securing advanced blockchain solutions like Venom's could provide both technological benefits and a strategic advantage in the global arena of green finance.

Chinese media outlet Toutiao has reported that a major financial technology firm in China is in talks to acquire blockchain infrastructure from Venom Foundation, a project based in Abu Dhabi. While details remain confidential, the potential transaction has sparked debate about how China might deploy blockchain technology in pursuit of climate and sustainability goals. The report comes amid a series of unconventional experiments in the sector. Earlier this year, Bit Origin shifted toward digital asset infrastructure , using Dogecoin in its treasury as part of a pivot strategy. While small in scale, the move highlighted the appetite among Chinese-linked companies to test new approaches. A Venom acquisition would represent a more substantial play: embedding high-performance blockchain into ESG and climate finance systems. Venom has distinguished itself with a combination of speed, scalability, and regulatory adaptability. Stress tests this year showed throughput of up to 150,000 transactions per second with settlement times under three seconds. Its sharding model and parallel execution framework enable the platform to handle heavy workloads, while its built-in KYC and AML tools, alongside support for state-backed stablecoins, align with regulatory demands. What makes Venom particularly relevant in this context is its suitability for environmental applications. Immutable blockchain records could underpin transparent carbon credit registries, enabling companies and regulators to verify emissions data in real time. This could reduce the risk of greenwashing and strengthen investor confidence in ESG markets. When paired with artificial intelligence, Venom’s infrastructure could also help banks and insurers generate continuous environmental risk assessments, linking financial flows to sustainability outcomes. China has already demonstrated interest in scaling its influence through green acquisitions. The State Grid Corporation of China has invested heavily in renewable energy projects, while China Three Gorges Corporation has acquired clean-energy assets overseas to expand its global footprint. A potential Venom deal would mirror these strategies: leveraging external innovation to serve national objectives, in this case by embedding blockchain at the heart of green finance systems. Analysts suggest such an acquisition would position China not only to track its own 2030 carbon peak commitments but also to set standards for how ESG data is managed globally. By providing infrastructure that links compliance, transparency, and real-time analytics, China could influence the rules of climate finance in a way that aligns with its policy agenda. Sources indicate the Venom talks could conclude between late 2025 and early 2026, though neither party has offered comment. The broader question remains whether blockchain can shift from niche applications to a core part of the world’s financial system. For China, Venom could represent both a technological solution and a geopolitical lever, a way to lead in the emerging global market for green finance.

On September 8, Sam Altman revealed in an X post that he had experienced the “strangest experience” while reading about the growth of OpenAI’s Codex model , which led him instinctively to assume the comments were all from fake accounts or bots. i have had the strangest experience reading this: i assume its all fake/bots, even though in this case i know codex growth is really strong and the trend here is real. i think there are a bunch of things going on: real people have picked up quirks of LLM-speak, the Extremely… https://t.co/9buqM3ZpKe — Sam Altman (@sama) September 8, 2025 Altman’s observation came after a ‘strange experience’ “I have had the strangest experience reading this,” he began . “I assume it’s all fake/bots, even though in this case I know codex growth is really strong and the trend here is real.” The OpenAI CEO seemed to be implying he could not decide if the comments were real or from bots. “I think there are a bunch of things going on,” he continued, attempting to diagnose the cause. He attributed it to factors like how real people have picked up quirks of “LLM-speak,” optimization pressure from social media platforms now rewarding engagement, and companies using “astroturfing” tactics. In conclusion, he surmised that the net effect of all this is that “somehow AI twitter/AI reddit feels very fake in a way it really didn’t a year or two ago.” The reaction to the post was mixed, with some from people with an axe to grind with Altman and his company. One comment that stood out came from a user who identified as the founding mod of the r/claudecode subreddit. “I think some context helps,” they wrote. “While the comments in that screenshot may look bot-like, none of those accounts trigger removal or spam filters. Most have been around for 5+ years, active across hundreds of subs, and don’t follow fake-account patterns. If they were paid, there’s no way for us to reliably verify.” According to the user, “what has shifted is the tone of the sub since GPT-5. A lot of people moving in are preferring Codex CLI over Claude code, and naturally, a vocal group pushes back. Niche communities always amplify those swings. I’d say good job there, OpenAI.” Altman complained about bots running X accounts Altman’s recent comment comes days after he admitted that he never took the dead internet theory seriously, until now, when it seems “like there are really a lot of LLM-run Twitter accounts now.” Sam Altman is open to the conspiracy theory that LLM accounts now run social media. Source: @sama via X (Formerly Twitter) The Dead Internet Theory is a conspiracy theory that claims the internet is no longer being controlled by real people, but mostly by bots and AI-generated content. The idea postulates that most online activity, including comments, posts, and articles, is not genuine and is all created to manipulate public opinion and control users. According to a review of the theory published in multiple sources, including New York Magazine, it has two key strands: Displacement of human activity in which bots and algorithmic curation dominate what users encounter, and coordinated control, where governments and corporations may be intentionally curating content, limiting genuine interaction, and amplifying artificial voices. For now, there is no evidence of a vast state-run conspiracy, but the considerable rise of bot traffic and “link rot” continues to fuel the debate. Altman’s comment ignited fresh debate on the topic, with many confirming his suspicions by confessing they had also encountered suspiciously repetitive or AI-generated replies. Others questioned the irony of the statement since his company, OpenAI , may have played the most significant role in mainstreaming AI and chatbots.

Crypto analyst Skew wrote on X that MYX ""traded pretty normally between $2 & $4"" but things began to get questionable during a targeted short squeeze that sent the token from $4 to $8. ""Clearly in the aftermath of that move some liquidity provider or market maker got massive carried out, especially with sizable liquidations that occurred,"" they added. MYX Finance is a decentralized exchange that has just $55 million in total value locked (TVL) and $5 million in open interest, being dwarfed by the likes of HyperLiquid that have $712 million and $12.8 billion respectively. Despite the major disparity, MYX has a fully diluted value of $17.7 billion, rivaling HYPE's market cap of $17.5 billion. It's worth noting that more than 80% of MYX's supply is currently locked, with just 197 million tokens circulating, which means the assets could be prone to manipulation with such a constricted supply as several traders pointed out on X .

After testing support at $4.83, the token mounted a strong rally to reach $5.05 by 06:00 UTC before falling back. That move confirmed $4.83 as a crucial accumulation zone, where volume surged to 348,793 units, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model. The rally faltered at $5.05, where concentrated distribution created a firm ceiling. The reversal accelerated, beginning with consolidation near $4.97 before a late push to $4.99 at 14:00 UTC. Selling pressure then overwhelmed the market, driving ICP down to $4.93 within minutes. At the time of writing, ICP traded just below $4.90, 3% below its intraday high of $5.05. Turnover spiked sharply during this interval, with more than 170,000 units transacted between 14:01 and 14:03, suggesting systematic liquidations or stop-loss execution. Beyond technicals, ICP’s momentum reflects ongoing ecosystem development . On Sept. 4, the network achieved its Ignition milestone, enabling large language models (LLMs) to run natively on-chain. The upgrade allows developers to build AI-powered decentralized applications (dapps), including those that can generate smart contracts directly, on the ICP blockchain. The long-term vision is to create a “self-writing Internet” where even non-technical users can deploy dapps using natural language inputs. Technical Analysis ICP traded in a $0.22 corridor between $4.83 support and $5.05 resistance. Strong accumulation confirmed at $4.83, supported by above-average volume of 348,793 units. Rally peaked at $5.05 before heavy selling emerged. A sharp reversal saw prices fall from $4.99 to $4.93 within minutes. Volume exceeded 170,000 units during 14:01–14:03, signaling systematic liquidation. New support formed at $4.93, marking a potential pivot for future sessions. Resistance remains entrenched at $5.05, the key threshold for a sustained breakout.

Institutional flows have returned in force. CoinShares reports $2.48 billion in net inflows last week alone, capping August with $4.37 billion and bringing the year-to-date tally to $35.5 billion, 58% higher than the same period last year. This signals that despite macro turbulence, money is steadily finding its way back into crypto. Digital asset investment products saw outflows totalling US$352M last week. @ethereum was primarily responsible for the net weekly outflows, seeing US$912M last week.

Europe followed at a distance, with Switzerland adding $109.4 million, Germany $69.9 million, and Canada $41.1 million. These figures highlight that demand isn’t confined to one region. Friday’s small outflows look more like profit-taking than weakness in the trend. Bitcoin, Ethereum ETFs Rebound With $2.48 Billion Net Inflows Week https://t.co/a8oo3oqniA — ixmaeel btc (@ixmaeelbtc) September 8, 2025 Ethereum surprisingly stole the spotlight, drawing $1.4 billion, while Bitcoin attracted $748 million . Solana and XRP also benefitted, collecting $177 million and $134 million, respectively, as optimism grows around ETF approvals. Recent data confirms the rotation: Bitcoin ETFs saw +$633M inflows this week (Sep 4), reversing August's $751M outflows, while Ethereum ETFs had $135M outflows but dominated earlier with $3.87B in Aug. Total crypto inflows hit $2.48B last week. September's historically volatile,… — Grok (@grok) September 5, 2025 What’s important here is the investor rotation: institutions chase Ethereum’s growth but consistently return to Bitcoin when uncertainty rises. Macro Turbulence Still Matters Last week’s optimism was dented by the release of Core PCE inflation data, which dampened hopes for a September Fed rate cut. Crypto assets under management decreased by 10% to $219 billion following the news. But the pullback looks temporary. As Konstantin Anissimov of Currency.com noted, Ethereum funds alone generated nearly $4 billion in August, indicating that the appetite hasn’t disappeared. In my experience, this is the pattern we’ve seen for years: investors take risks with Ethereum when markets are calm, but they move back to Bitcoin whenever macro risks build. Bitcoin’s safe-haven appeal continues to surface, reinforced by $250 million of ETF inflows last week alone. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Breakout or Breakdown? On the charts, Bitcoin price prediction is turning bearish in the short run as BTC is pressing against resistance at $113,400 while building a base of higher lows, a textbook ascending triangle. The 50-SMA sits at $111,325, and the 200-SMA at $112,755, providing bulls with layered support. The RSI has cooled to 47 after testing 60, leaving room for momentum to reset before another move higher. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview If buyers manage a clean break above $113,400, the following levels to watch are $115,400 and $117,150. A stronger push could extend the run to $125,000 in the medium term. On the flip side, losing the $110,000 floor risks a slide toward $108,450 and $107,407. For traders, the setup is straightforward: a close above $113,400 opens room for longs targeting $117,000 and possibly $130,000, while stops should stay below $110,000. With institutional demand resurging and technical indicators suggesting a coil is ready to unwind, Bitcoin may be preparing for its next major rally. This is the kind of setup where whales quietly position, leaving retail to catch up once the breakout is already underway. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM).

The stock was higher by 4.5% as midday U.S. hours approached.. The new fund, called CoreWeave Ventures, will focus on investing in startups building tools, infrastructure or applications for AI. The company didn’t disclose how much capital would be committed but framed the effort as an extension of its broader mission to support high-performance computing for machine learning and generative AI. “Our aim with CoreWeave Ventures is to give other audacious, like-minded founders the support they need to drive technical advancements and bring to market the next class of innovation,” said Brannin McBee, co-founder and chief development officer at CoreWeave. CoreWeave specializes in cloud computing optimized for AI workloads, offering access to Nvidia GPUs and fast storage to clients ranging from large enterprises to research labs. It went public earlier this year at $40 per share and surged to a high of $187 in June before pulling back. The launch of CoreWeave Ventures comes during a busy period for cloud infrastructure firms focused on AI. On Monday, Nebius, another player in the “neocloud” space, signed a five-year, $19.4 billion agreement with Microsoft to supply computing power. That announcement sent several AI and data center stocks higher, adding momentum to the sector. CoreWeave is also in the process of acquiring bitcoin miner Core Scientific (CORZ) in a $9 billion all-stock deal. The merger, announced in July, is still subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals. For AI startups, the arrival of another specialized investor could offer an alternative to generalist VC firms or hyperscaler-linked capital.

Stella Li, executive vice-president of BYD, said the current number of carmakers was unsustainable and that the country’s market was too overcrowded. “Even 20 OEMs is too much,” she said during an interview with the Financial Times at the Munich Motor Show, stressing that price-based competition can no longer be the basis for survival. The Chinese government is targeting what it calls “neijuan”, translated as involution, which refers to extreme internal competition that ends up being self-defeating. Officials say discounting in the car industry is one of the reasons for the country’s worsening deflation, and the administration under President Xi Jinping is cracking down hard. Until now, China has had more than 130 manufacturers competing for slices of the world’s largest market for electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. But that free-for-all is coming to an end. BYD predicts collapse as competition tightens Li warned that “some of the original equipment makers will be pushed out,” now that they can no longer rely on discounts to attract buyers. The ban hits at a time when EV prices in China have already fallen sharply, and smaller firms are being squeezed on all sides. BYD’s rivals, including Xpeng, also expect the total number of players to crash over the next few years. Xpeng has said the global car industry could shrink to just 10 companies by the end of the decade. Data from AlixPartners shows that of the 129 brands selling EVs and hybrids in China last year, only 15 are expected to stay financially afloat by 2030. BYD believes that with price wars out of the way, buyers will now focus more on technology, driving experience, and product quality. That shift plays to BYD’s strengths, but even the biggest player is not immune to government pressure. Despite its position in the market, BYD reported lower-than-expected revenue and net profit in the second quarter. Analysts say the company was affected by new rules targeting delayed payments to suppliers and Beijing’s overall effort to remove pricing loopholes. Investment bank Citi responded by slashing its forecasts for BYD’s sales. Instead of the 5.8 million cars it had expected BYD to sell in 2025, Citi now expects only 4.6 million. For 2026, the estimate dropped from 7.2 million to 5.4 million, and for 2027, from 8.4 million to 6 million. Last year, BYD sold 4.3 million vehicles. Li tried to ease concerns, saying, “I think our profit will still remain strong.” But she also admitted that more Chinese carmakers were now looking outside of the domestic market. “I think you will see more Chinese companies come overseas, but the overseas market is not that simple,” she said. That expansion push includes BYD’s own strategy in Europe, where the company is trying to secure more sales amid growing protectionist policies from the EU. BYD, Changan, Leapmotor expand beyond China BYD is moving forward with plans to start vehicle production in Hungary before the end of the year. Li confirmed the factory project is on track, but added that scaling up would take more time. Alongside BYD, other Chinese brands are making moves abroad. Changan, a state-owned automaker, has just launched in the UK, while several others are using aggressive pricing and high-spec software features to draw in European customers. At the same time, Leapmotor, a Chinese EV startup, has entered a joint venture with Stellantis to explore manufacturing options inside Europe. Tianshu Xin, who leads the joint venture, said there is no immediate need to localize production despite the EU raising tariffs on EVs made in China. Leapmotor is considering building its B10 electric SUV at a Stellantis plant in Spain, but for now, the company is sticking to Chinese manufacturing. Xin said Leapmotor is managing well by using Stellantis’ supply chain and dealership network. When asked why the company isn’t shifting to European production yet, Xin said: “The [labour] cost is so high and the energy is so high.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",Tech|BYD,EN,0,0,MARKET|ASIA|BUSINESS|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-09 15:49:25

World chain bridge deposits broke an all-time peak above $1B. World (WLD), formerly known as Worldcoin, is back in the spotlight this week. The project gained attention after a vertical rally for the native WLD token after months of sideways trading. The WLD rally was sparked by the announcement of the Eightco Holdings treasury, aiming to inject $250M into the token, as Cryptopolitan previously reported . WLD open interest moved to its highest range, though it still stands at $540M. The project has re-emerged in the crypto space, after years of skepticism linked to the data-gathering task of the Orb, as well as the relatively small free float, with a big team and investor allocations. WLD trades on record volumes WLD extended its winning streak after a new Upbit listing, tapping the lively South Korean market. Following the announcement, WLD broke above the $2 mark. The token already relies on the Korean won for more than 29% of its activity. Additional demand from South Korean markets is expected to boost WLD following the addition of trading pairs on Upbit. Upbit was also the main reason for the KAITO token expansion. The market is relatively conservative in listings, but has brought consistent volumes to all of the selected projects. After Monday’s rally, WLD continued on the same track, reaching a peak at $2.12, a price range not seen since January. WLD has had previous runs, but this time around, the expansion happens on peak volumes. WLD trading activity reached an all-time daily peak at $4.65B for the past 24 hours. Binance was the peak driver of WLD expansion, but Bithumb also boosted the token. Soon after peaking, WLD took a step back to $1.86, though retaining its momentum and mindshare growth. WLD turned into one of the most mentioned tickers as of September 9, with Google searches also picking up. World marks peak bridge inflows The sudden popularity of WLD as a treasury token and the vertical rally raised demand for bridging assets to WLD. World Chain bridged value has been growing gradually, with wrapped assets meant for DeFi activity. Based on Token Terminal estimates, World has now attracted over $1.1B through bridge deposits. World Chain saw peak bridge deposits, breaking above $1.1B for the first time. | Source: Token Terminal The deposits into World Chaina accelerated once again in September. World Chain carries a small DeFi sector, with most of the inflows in WETH and WBTC. Currently, DeFi apps carry around $95M in value locked, with a native lending version of Morpho as the top liquidity hub. World Chain is also still in its expansion stage. Since late 2024, the chain has grown its daily active users. After months with around 15K daily active users, World Chain experienced another wave of growth. Currently, the chain has over 75K daily active users. The recent spike in activity may be due to demand for trading and the popularity of WLD. However, the chain has also reported a growing number of accounts using proof of humanity. As Sam Altman watches the expansion of AI, the counter-role of World may also grow in importance.

The Little Pepe presale has already reached $25M, with over 98% of tokens sold and the price doubling from its initial level. That kind of momentum puts the project clearly on the radar of traders chasing the next 100x opportunity. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, Little Pepe incorporates utility into its design. The team has developed its own Layer 2 blockchain that offers near-instant transactions, no trading taxes, and security measures to prevent bots and rug pulls. With a CertiK audit and an ecosystem plan that features a meme launchpad named ‘Pepe’s Pump Pad,’ $LILPEPE aims to be more than just another frog with a funny name. The big question now: does this momentum signal the start of another Doge-like run to sit alongside the top meme coins ? From Casino Bets to Layer 2 Tech The meme coin market often feels like a slot machine. You put in some $ETH or $SOL and hope for green candles, praying the devs don’t disappear. Most projects rely on hype and little more. Little Pepe is trying to change that playbook. Instead of using Ethereum or Solana and incurring high fees, $LILPEPE features its own Layer 2 blockchain. Transactions are nearly instantaneous, gas costs are minimal, and buyers aren’t surprised by hidden trading taxes. For anyone who’s experienced fees eating into their meme coin collection, that’s a welcome change. Security is another aspect. Little Pepe has bot protection and smart contracts designed to make rug pulls almost impossible, and it has already passed a CertiK audit . Because the chain is EVM -compatible, developers can port existing Ethereum dApps without starting from scratch. That lowers the barrier for building out the ecosystem—giving $LILPEPE a shot at being more than a one-season meme. Tokenomics Breakdown: 100B Supply, 26.5% Presale, and Staking Rewards Many meme coins have unclear token allocation, but Little Pepe’s structure is transparent. The total supply is limited to 100 billion $LILPEPE, with 26.5% allocated for the presale and 30% reserved for chain reserves to support the Layer 2. An additional 13.5% funds staking rewards, while liquidity, marketing, and centralized exchange reserves each receive 10%. That balance means early buyers aren’t left holding the entire bag. Once listings start, there’s potential for growth, and staking offers additional incentives for those wanting to lock tokens in instead of flipping them. Beyond token splits, the team is working to develop a meme ecosystem that has real potential. The main feature is Pepe’s Pump Pad, a launchpad for new meme coins created to make token creation safer and easier. If it succeeds, it could position $LILPEPE as a broader platform, not just a single token. The roadmap also aims for a $1B market cap and reaching the CMC top 100 , which may sound ambitious, but aligns with the broader bull cycle’s interest in utility-backed meme projects. Presale Frenzy: $25M Raised, 98% of Tokens Already Gone The Little Pepe presale has crossed $25M, with more than 15.5B tokens sold – roughly 98.7% of the allocation. Early buyers purchased $LILPEPE at $0.0010, but the price has now doubled to $0.0021 as the sale progresses through its later stages. Each round sells out faster than the previous one, a typical sign of increasing FOMO. This level of momentum demonstrates how much attention $LILPEPE is gaining ahead of its exchange debut. The $777K Giveaway Fueling Community Buzz Adding to the hype, Little Pepe is hosting a $777K token giveaway . Ten winners will each receive $77K worth of $LILPEPE, a substantial prize pool compared to the small promotions most meme coins run. To qualify, buyers must invest at least $100 in the presale. Doing extra social media tasks earns more entries, making the contest both a community effort and a viral marketing campaign. For the team, it’s also a sign of confidence. Projects don’t give out three-quarters of a million dollars’ worth of tokens unless they believe they will be worth even more. Final Thoughts – Can $LILPEPE Be the Next 100x Meme Coin? Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) positions itself as more than just another meme coin. It combines Layer 2 speed, zero-tax trading, and meme culture into a package that has already raised $25M. Add anti-rug protections, a CertiK audit, and community buzz around the $777K giveaway, and it’s clear why discussions of it being the next crypto to explode with a possible 100x run are emerging. But meme coins remain speculative by nature. The volatility that made $DOGE and $SHIB famous also damaged many investors. This article is not financial advice.

According to real-time market monitoring from Bitcoin World, the flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading around $110,944.96 on the Binance USDT market. This sudden dip has certainly caught the attention of investors worldwide, raising questions about market stability and what might be next for BTC. What Triggered This Sudden Bitcoin Price Fall? Whenever we see a substantial Bitcoin price fall , it’s natural to seek explanations. While the exact catalysts can be complex and multi-faceted, several factors often contribute to such market movements. These can include broader macroeconomic trends, unexpected regulatory news, large institutional sell-offs, or even technical market indicators hitting critical levels. Understanding these potential triggers is vital for making informed decisions. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic uncertainty or shifts in traditional financial markets can ripple into crypto. Whale Movements: Large holders (often called ‘whales’) moving significant amounts of BTC can create selling pressure. Technical Breakdowns: Failing to hold key support levels can trigger automated selling, exacerbating the drop. Market Sentiment: A general shift from bullish to bearish sentiment can accelerate price drops, creating a feedback loop. This particular dip below $111,000 signals a potential shift in short-term market dynamics, prompting many to reassess their positions and consider potential future movements. Navigating the Volatility: What Should Investors Do During a BTC Price Drop? A Bitcoin price fall can be unsettling, but it also presents opportunities for those prepared. Panic selling is rarely the best strategy. Instead, consider a more measured approach to protect your assets and potentially capitalize on future recoveries. Do Your Research: Always verify information from reliable sources like Bitcoin World market monitoring before making any decisions. Reassess Your Portfolio: Evaluate your risk tolerance and asset allocation. Is your portfolio diversified enough to withstand market fluctuations? Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, buying small amounts regularly, even during dips, can average out your purchase price over time. Set Stop-Loss Orders: For active traders, these can help limit potential losses by automatically selling your assets if they drop to a predetermined price. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, expert analyses, and upcoming events that could influence Bitcoin’s price. It’s crucial to remember that crypto markets are inherently volatile. Long-term strategies often outperform short-term reactive trading based on fear or speculation. Is This Bitcoin Price Fall a Buying Opportunity or a Warning Sign? The recent Bitcoin price fall sparks a familiar debate among crypto enthusiasts: is this a temporary setback, or a sign of deeper issues? For some, every significant dip represents a chance to “buy the dip” and accumulate more BTC at a lower price, anticipating future recovery and growth. They view Bitcoin’s underlying technology and adoption as strong, making current prices attractive for accumulation. However, others see it as a warning sign. They might point to potential overhead resistance, a lack of strong buying volume, or broader market weaknesses that could signal further declines. Their caution suggests waiting for clearer signs of recovery before re-entering the market. Ultimately, the answer depends on your investment horizon, risk appetite, and personal conviction about Bitcoin’s future trajectory. The Broader Crypto Market and the Impact of Bitcoin’s Movement Bitcoin’s dominance in the cryptocurrency ecosystem means that a significant Bitcoin price fall often sends ripples across the entire market. Altcoins frequently follow BTC’s lead, experiencing their own dips when Bitcoin struggles. This interconnectedness highlights Bitcoin’s role as the market’s bellwether, influencing the sentiment and performance of thousands of other digital assets. When BTC experiences a downturn, investor confidence can wane, leading to a broader market sell-off as traders de-risk across their portfolios. Conversely, a strong Bitcoin recovery can uplift the entire market, signaling renewed optimism. This makes monitoring Bitcoin’s price action essential not just for BTC holders, but for anyone invested in the wider crypto space. It underscores the importance of a holistic market view rather than focusing solely on individual assets. The recent Bitcoin price fall below $111,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While such dips can be concerning, they are a normal part of a maturing asset class. Investors are encouraged to remain calm, rely on credible sources like Bitcoin World market monitoring, and employ well-thought-out strategies rather than succumbing to emotional trading. Whether this dip becomes a fleeting moment or a precursor to further movements, staying informed and prepared is key to navigating the exciting world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions About the Bitcoin Price Fall Understanding market movements can be challenging. Here are some common questions about the recent Bitcoin price fall : Q: Why did Bitcoin fall below $111,000? A: Bitcoin’s price movements are influenced by various factors, including macroeconomic trends, large investor actions, technical market indicators, and overall market sentiment. A combination of these elements likely contributed to the recent dip. Q: Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? A: For long-term investors who believe in Bitcoin’s fundamental value, a price dip can be seen as a buying opportunity. However, it’s crucial to conduct your own research, assess your risk tolerance, and consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging. This is not financial advice. Q: How does a Bitcoin price fall affect other cryptocurrencies? A: Bitcoin often acts as a benchmark for the broader crypto market. A significant BTC price drop can lead to a ripple effect, causing many altcoins to experience similar downward movements due to interconnected market sentiment and trading pairs. Q: What should I do if my Bitcoin investment is losing value? A: Avoid panic selling. Instead, reassess your investment strategy, review your portfolio diversification, and consider if your initial investment thesis still holds. Staying informed and consulting with financial advisors can also be beneficial. Q: Where can I get reliable updates on Bitcoin’s price? A: Reputable cryptocurrency news outlets and market monitoring platforms, such as Bitcoin World, provide real-time updates and analyses. Always cross-reference information from multiple trusted sources. Was this analysis of the recent Bitcoin price fall helpful?

This aggressive positioning signals growing confidence that the token is poised for an upward breakout in the coming days. Options data is often considered a window into market sentiment, and right now, the outlook is decisively tilted toward higher prices. CoinDesi notes that the majority of call activity is concentrated around the $2.90 strike, suggesting traders see this level as the next major battleground. Price targets being discussed include $2.90, the psychologically significant $3 mark, and potentially as high as $3.50 before September 12. The renewed bullishness follows a period of consolidation for XRP, which has recently struggled to hold momentum despite broader optimism in the crypto space. However, options traders appear to be betting that a breakout is imminent. A surge in call buying generally indicates expectations of strong upward price action, as traders are willing to pay a premium for the right to buy at higher levels. What makes $2.90 especially important is not just its technical relevance, but also its role as a stepping stone toward $3, a price that carries symbolic weight. Round numbers in crypto often serve as psychological anchors, drawing in retail attention and amplifying momentum once broken. Just hours ago, XRP surged back above the key $3 psychological level after weeks of resistance, sparking a fresh wave of market optimism. Although XRP has pulled back to $2.96 , call options targeting $3.50 highlight traders’ expectations of momentum-driven overshooting. Should trading volume and liquidity align with bullish sentiment, XRP could extend beyond conservative projections, catching short sellers and hesitant traders off guard. For now, the message from options traders is clear that the majority of them are betting on XRP climbing higher, with September 12 shaping up as a crucial short-term milestone. Ripple Reportedly Running Trials with Nasdaq, Says Market Observer SMQKE Renowned crypto observer SMQKE reports that Ripple is running trials with Nasdaq, one of the world’s largest stock exchanges. If confirmed, this would mark a major step in linking traditional finance with blockchain settlement technology, sparking speculation over XRP’s role in powering global markets. Ripple has long positioned itself as a key player in modernizing cross-border payments and liquidity management. Its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) system leverages XRP to settle transactions in seconds, offering an alternative to the slow and expensive infrastructure of legacy systems like SWIFT. Trials with Nasdaq suggest Ripple’s technology could expand beyond international remittances and into capital markets, where trillions of dollars flow daily. Though details remain scarce, SMQKE’s claim has electrified the crypto community. Nasdaq, home to over 4,000 companies worth $25 trillion, is a cornerstone of global finance. If Ripple’s technology is indeed under trial there, it could signal a game-changing leap toward faster settlements, reduced costs, and seamless integration of digital assets with traditional markets. Therefore, if the Ripple-Nasdaq collaboration materializes, it could herald the rise of blockchain-driven efficiencies in capital markets, an industry primed for disruption. Even if XRP isn’t directly involved, these trials suggest that traditional financial giants are moving beyond isolated experiments and exploring blockchain integration at the core of their operations. Conclusion If confirmed, Ripple’s trials with Nasdaq could mark a pivotal moment for finance, signaling a future where digital assets integrate seamlessly with global markets. XRP’s potential role highlights crypto’s rising legitimacy, positioning Ripple as a bridge between legacy systems and the next era of financial technology. Meanwhile, XRP traders are betting big on a surge, with most action around $2.90 and targets up to $3.50. The next few days will reveal if this bullish sentiment drives real momentum.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|TRADING|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-09 15:55:27

Building on the release earlier this year of x402, an open source payment protocol that enables instant stablecoin payments on any website, Coinbase engineers have added a discovery layer for AI agents, something like a “Google for agents,” that the firm is calling x402 Bazaar. This matters because it’s about unlocking new paradigms within agentic commerce , a term often associated with humans setting out requirements and preferences for AI agents to shop for them. In fact, the marketplace of things AI agents are going to want to buy is actually significantly bigger than the things that humans may want to buy, says Erik Reppel, head of engineering at Coinbase Developer Platform. He used the term “pay-per-crawl” to describe the problem being solved. “Think of it as like paywalls for scrapers,” Reppel said in an interview. “ So x402 is a great standard for situations where an AI agent needs access to data or access to content in order to make more informed, better decisions.” Imagine an agent pulling the latest market data, commissioning a design from an AI art model, or subscribing to a live data feed for sports or finance, Coinbase said in a blog about x402 Bizarre.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new decentralized finance (DeFi) behemoth, is creating a buzz with analysts identifying a huge 55x growth potential. The new entrant into the market, valued at $0.035, has proceeded to phase 6 out of 11 in presale. In the next phase, investors will be looking at a 14.3% higher price per token. More than 16 thousand investors are now on track to receive their tokens at launch, with more joining in. This wave of investor enthusiasm reflects a growing appetite for innovative lending and liquidity protocols to upend market incumbents. With XRP remaining firm on reserve optimism, all eyes now shift to how Mutuum Finance will upend Q4 2025’s DeFi narrative. XRP Posts Modest Gains as Q4 Projections Gain Nuance XRP hovers at $2.82, following a 5% crash over the past 7 days. As Q4 2025 draws near, analysts highlight the major consolidation zone of $2.82–$2.88, and also state that a move higher than $2.90 can reverse the momentum to bullish, and that a drop below $2.70 can suggest a deeper decline. More positive predictions are that a break above the $3.10 resistance with a bull flag pattern can send XRP to $5, a possible 77% increase, but that will require sustained technical strength and additional demand. Bitget analysts’ predictions see XRP at $5 before the year concludes if institutional demand and macro-friendly conditions continue. While XRP is mapping out its future, new coins, such as for Mutuum Finance, are gaining more investors. Mutuum Finance Phase 6 Presale Mutuum Finance is now in Phase 6 of its presale, with tokens sold at $0.035. It has moved quickly and has already collected more than $15.5 million in investments. Mutuum Finance plans to launch a USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum network. This stablecoin will be used for simple transactions and can be held long-term. Mutuum Finance also offers a multi-functional, dual-lending DeFi platform. This system is built on smart contract technology and allows both lenders and borrowers to have control, ownership, and transparency. It aims to make the network secure, scalable, and accessible to both retail and institutional investors. Mutuum Finance Protocol Overview Mutuum Finance (MUTM) uses variable interest rates and makes an attempt to control liquidity. The interest rate on borrowing will fluctuate according to utilization: high rates will induce borrowing when capital availability is high and low capital availability will induce loan and deposit repayment. Fixed rates for borrowers are established, will be more than variable rates, and are possible only for liquid assets. Risk parameters, Asset parameters Strong basis risk controls will render under-collateralized positions normal and over-collateralize borrowers. Secondary markets are risky tokenization collateral, illiquid or volatile asset caps for deposits. The protocol is hedged and liquid against Loan-to-Value ratios, liquidity caps, penalties, and reserve factors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) takes center stage while Ripple (XRP) sets sights on modest Q4 gains. Stage 6 tokens are at $0.035 and are set to move 14.29% to $0.04 in Stage 7, with over $15.5M+ raised and 16,150+ investors signed up. Experts predict 55x future upside potential powered by its dual-lending DeFi framework, stablecoin-pegged USD, and sophisticated risk management system. While XRP experiences back and forth movement at $2.82, Mutuum Finance is emerging as the preferred high-upside play. Buy Stage 6 tokens today before the next presale increase.

Recently, Vietnam took a significant step, embarking on a groundbreaking five-year pilot program aimed at shaping its Vietnam crypto regulation . This initiative, as reported by industry sources, marks a crucial period for the country’s cryptocurrency landscape, aiming to strike a delicate balance between fostering technological advancement and ensuring robust investor protection. What Does This Groundbreaking Pilot Program Entail? Vietnam’s new pilot program is designed to thoroughly test a comprehensive regulatory framework for its burgeoning cryptocurrency market. The primary goal is to establish clear and enforceable rules across various aspects of the crypto ecosystem. Coin Issuance: Clear guidelines for how new digital tokens can be created and introduced to the market. Trading Activities: Regulations governing the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies. Foreign Investment: Rules for how international capital can participate in Vietnam’s crypto space. This forward-thinking approach demonstrates Vietnam’s commitment to creating a secure and transparent environment for digital asset participants. The overarching aim is to protect investors from potential risks while still allowing room for innovation to flourish. Why These Strict Rules for Digital Assets in Vietnam? Under this new framework, Vietnam is implementing some distinct and impactful rules. These measures reflect a cautious yet determined strategy to maintain economic stability and prevent speculative excesses within its financial system. Key restrictions include: Exclusive Vietnamese Dong Transactions: All cryptocurrency transactions, from initial token issuance to trading and payment processing, must be conducted solely in Vietnamese dong. This measure aims to give the central bank greater control over monetary flow and reduce reliance on foreign currencies for digital asset activities. Local Company Issuance Only: The ability to issue new cryptocurrencies will be restricted to local companies. This encourages domestic innovation and keeps the value creation within the national economy, fostering local talent and infrastructure development. Real Asset Collateral Requirement: Cryptocurrencies backed by fiat currency or traditional securities are strictly prohibited. Instead, only real assets – tangible goods or verifiable physical properties – are permitted as collateral. This provides a more robust and transparent backing for digital tokens, potentially reducing volatility and increasing trust. These stringent guidelines are a clear indication of Vietnam’s commitment to a controlled and secure digital asset market. The emphasis on real asset backing, for instance, aims to prevent the kind of unbacked speculative bubbles seen in other markets. Benefits and Challenges of Vietnam’s Crypto Regulation Approach The introduction of such a structured Vietnam crypto regulation program brings both promising benefits and notable challenges. Understanding these aspects is crucial for anyone involved in or observing the Vietnamese crypto space. Potential Benefits: Enhanced Investor Protection: Clear rules and asset-backed requirements can significantly reduce fraud and market manipulation, building greater confidence among retail and institutional investors. Fostering Local Innovation: By restricting issuance to local companies, Vietnam could stimulate its domestic blockchain and crypto industry, creating jobs and technological advancements within the country. Economic Stability: Controlling transactions in Vietnamese dong helps the central bank manage monetary policy more effectively, mitigating potential risks to financial stability from unregulated crypto flows. Clarity for Businesses: A defined legal framework offers certainty for businesses looking to operate in the crypto space, encouraging legitimate enterprises to invest and grow. Anticipated Challenges: Risk of Stifling Growth: Overly strict regulations might deter some innovative projects or foreign investment, potentially slowing the overall growth of the crypto market. Adaptability: The cryptocurrency landscape evolves rapidly. A five-year pilot program might struggle to keep pace with new technologies and market trends, requiring flexibility in its implementation. International Competitiveness: While protecting local interests, these rules could make Vietnam less attractive compared to jurisdictions with more permissive crypto environments. Balancing these elements will be key to the success of Vietnam crypto regulation during this pilot phase. What Does This Mean for You? Actionable Insights on Vietnam Crypto Regulation For individuals and entities looking to engage with Vietnam’s cryptocurrency market, this pilot program necessitates careful consideration and strategic planning. The new rules redefine the operational landscape. For Local Businesses and Innovators: Understand the Framework: Deeply familiarize yourself with the new rules for coin issuance and trading. Focus on Real Assets: If considering token issuance, ensure your projects are backed by verifiable real assets. Embrace Compliance: Prioritize legal and regulatory compliance from the outset to build trust and avoid penalties. For Investors (Local and Foreign): Due Diligence is Paramount: Thoroughly research any cryptocurrency project originating from Vietnam, verifying its compliance with the new regulations. Currency Considerations: Be aware that all transactions must occur in Vietnamese dong, which may require currency exchange planning. Monitor Developments: The pilot nature means the framework could evolve. Stay informed about updates and adjustments. This period offers a unique opportunity for compliant, well-structured projects to thrive under a clear regulatory umbrella, ensuring a more secure and predictable environment for all participants in Vietnam crypto regulation . The Future of Digital Assets in Vietnam Vietnam’s five-year pilot program for Vietnam crypto regulation represents a significant and decisive move in the global effort to integrate digital assets into traditional financial systems responsibly. By prioritizing investor protection, promoting local innovation, and maintaining monetary control, Vietnam is charting a unique course. This program will undoubtedly provide invaluable insights, not just for Vietnam but for other nations grappling with similar regulatory challenges. The world will be watching closely as this crucial experiment unfolds, potentially setting a precedent for future digital asset governance.

According to the company, the stablecoin will be used to speed up payments and cut the fees usually tied to bank wires. Tembo Adopts RLUSD For Global Payments Tembo serves clients in mining, agriculture, military, construction and humanitarian work. Many of those customers are in developing regions where bank transfers are slow and costly. Based on reports, RLUSD can move value near-instantly across borders and at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. That is the main reason VivoPower gave for the change. The Vehicles And The Services Around Them Tembo builds electric utility vehicles designed for both on-road and tough off-road tasks. The fleet is aimed at jobs where reliability matters more than style. Charging, financing, battery swaps and even microgrids are offered alongside the vehicles. Those services are now available to be paid for in RLUSD, which could make transactions simpler for local dealers and international buyers alike. $VVPR – VivoPower’s Tembo to Accept Ripple USD (RLUSD) Stablecoin for Payments Partners with Doppler Finance for Institutional XRP and RLUSD Yield Programs: Maximizing Returns on Crypto Treasury Strategy Low Float/ OS near 4.5M shares 1.1% PreM/ $5.02 pic.twitter.com/Z6rUJ9G3nz — John Zidar aka/ Stock Wizard (@JohnZidar) September 8, 2025 Ripple Partnerships And Market Moves Reports have disclosed that RLUSD’s market capitalization rose roughly 10-fold since January. Ripple has been extending RLUSD’s reach through tie-ups with firms such as Chipper Cash, Yellow Card and VARL, and it recently rolled RLUSD into the Horizon RWA market owned by Aave. Those moves are being watched closely by firms that handle cross-border trade. Adoption in Africa, parts of Southeast-Asia and the Middle East is reported to be growing. VivoPower’s Broader XRP Strategy VivoPower has been clear that this is more than a single payment option. The company said it is shaping itself into what it calls an XRP-focused digital asset enterprise. Holdings in XRP and equity in Ripple Labs are being added to the corporate portfolio. Some of those assets are being held for treasury purposes. Other parts are planned to support decentralized finance infrastructure and real-world blockchain use cases connected to Tembo’s business. Implications For Treasury, Liquidity And Local Markets Market observers have pointed to links with institutional sponsors like Doppler Finance, suggesting RLUSD could play roles beyond payments — for liquidity management and corporate treasury planning. If that happens, the stablecoin may be used as a bridge between fiat rails and DeFi tools in places where traditional banking is weak. Vendors and partners in regions where Tembo operates could see faster settlements and fewer conversion fees.

Bulls are struggling to regain momentum after recent pullbacks, while mounting selling pressure continues to weigh on short-term sentiment. The tight consolidation reflects investor indecision, with both sides waiting for a decisive breakout that could shape the market’s next major move. Related Reading: Ethereum Dominates Trading Volume Despite Market Cool-Off – Details Despite the near-term weakness, the long-term view remains more constructive. According to top analyst Darkfost, the 30-day average Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) remains elevated but has started to cool off. Notably, its value has already dropped by half from its previous peak, signaling a slowdown in old coin movements. This decline suggests that the heaviest phase of long-term holder distribution may be easing, providing the market with some breathing room. If this cooling trend continues, it could reinforce Bitcoin’s long-term bullish outlook, even as short-term volatility persists. The combination of resilient support levels and declining long-term holder selling pressure may set the stage for a stronger recovery once external catalysts, such as Federal Reserve policy shifts, provide clarity. Strong LTH Movement Meets Resilient Demand Darkfost shared that the market has just experienced the strongest movement of old Bitcoin (LTHs) in this cycle so far. Long-term holders, who typically keep their coins dormant for extended periods, have been moving significant amounts of BTC back into circulation. This is a noteworthy development because it represents the most intense wave of long-term holder activity since the current bull cycle began. What makes this event particularly striking is that despite the heavy selling pressure from these seasoned holders, Bitcoin’s price has only corrected between 10% and 13% from its recent highs. By historical standards, this is a relatively modest drawdown, suggesting that the market remains resilient. Darkfost points out that the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric is crucial here. CDD tracks how long BTC has been held before being moved. When older coins are suddenly spent, it typically reflects distribution by experienced holders—often interpreted as profit-taking or a shift in positioning. A spike in CDD, therefore, signals significant selling pressure. However, the key takeaway is that demand has so far absorbed this spike remarkably well. Institutional inflows, treasury accumulation, and strong market liquidity appear to be offsetting the selling activity. While this doesn’t completely remove downside risk—especially if further long-term holders decide to exit—the market’s ability to withstand such a strong wave of distribution without a deeper crash is encouraging. The broader implication is that Bitcoin’s structure remains strong, even as it faces temporary challenges. If demand continues to hold firm, this phase of redistribution may ultimately serve as a healthy reset, setting the stage for the next leg higher. Still, investors should remain cautious: the market is not out of the woods just yet.

The chart shows that BTC has been in a consolidation phase following months of strong gains, with price action now hovering above the 100-day moving average (green line) and testing the mid-term trend structure. The 50-day moving average (blue line) is slightly above the current price, acting as short-term resistance. A decisive break above this level could open the door for another attempt at the $120K–$123K zone, which remains the critical resistance for bulls to reclaim in order to re-enter price discovery. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cycle Structure Questioned As VDD Mirrors Historic Tops On the downside, support is forming around the $110K–$108K range, close to the rising 100-day moving average, which has held well during previous corrections.

SharpLink also revealed that 100% of the ETH in its balance sheet is staked, which is generating revenue for the company. SharpLink Gaming’s stock price is currently exchanging hands at around $15.90, a 1.40% rise in the last 24 hours. The company has also seen a 29% decline in its share price in the past month, but it’s up more than 250% in the last 6 months. The tech company revealed that stock repurchases are immediately accretive to stockholders despite the stock trading below its NAV. SharpLink also plans to demonstrate its commitment to stockholders by repurchasing roughly 939,000 shares of its common stock at an average price of $15.98. The firm also expects to continue its repurchase program based on market conditions. The initiative will include cash on hand, cash available from operating activities like staking, or alternative forms of financing. “Maximizing stockholder value remains our top priority as we execute on our vision of being the most trusted ETH treasury company in the market.” – Joseph Chalom , Co-Chief Executive Officer of SharpLink. Chalom believes the firm’s zero debt, $3.6 million ETH on its balance sheet, and a strong income-generating ETH treasury give it a strong advantage. He maintained that the market is currently undervaluing its business. SharpLink also acknowledged that it has not used its At-the-Market (ATM) facility while trading below NAV. The company said it would use the ATM facility in an accretive manner for its stockholders if market conditions change. Chalom mentioned in August that the firm’s stock would be dilutive on an ETH per share basis to issue new equity through capital raising efforts if it trades below the NAV of its digital asset holdings. He said the initiative would lead to a repurchase of the company’s common stock. The official revealed Tuesday that instead of issuing equity while trading below NAV, the firm is more focused on disciplined capital allocation, such as share repurchases to increase stockholder value. He also acknowledged that SharpLink Gaming will continue to focus on the long-term Ethereum opportunity, which is reflected in its buyback strategy. SharpLink goes all-in on Ethereum On-chain data shows that SharpLink currently has around 837,230 ETH in its holdings worth over $3.6 billion. The increase came after the firm purchased 39,008 ETH last month at an average price of $4,531 per ETH. As the company’s ETH holdings consistently earn staking rewards, its total staking rewards hiked to 2,318 ETH as of August 31, 2025. In the week ending August 31, the firm also raised $46.6 million in net proceeds through its ATM facility. The firm also plans to occasionally repurchase its shares via open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. SharpLink also said it could halt the program at any time since it is not obligated to buy back any specific amount of shares. BitMine Immersion Technologies currently leads ETH treasury companies with 2,069,443 ETH in its holdings. The firm’s chair, Tom Lee, said that Wall Street’s move onto the blockchain has created a supercycle for the digital asset.

The token dropped to an $872 low earlier before rallying to $884 and then seeing a sharp reversal wipe out those gains. The initial drop took BNB from around $880.50 to a low of $871.99. From there, the token staged a comeback, peaking near $884.60 before selling pressure brought it back down to its current level at $873.6. That rebound came on a wave of trading activity, with volume spiking to nearly 60,000 tokens, particularly around $876, a level that acted as key support during the session, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. However, things quickly turned around for the token, which fell more than $5 in just minutes on a volume spike that coincided with a broader market sell-off. That drop came after reports that Israel launched an attack against Hamas’ leadership in Qatar. While the broader crypto market fell, the price of gold saw a bump that saw futures near a new record at $3,700 an ounce, while gold-backed cryptocurrencies PAXG and XAUT hit highs of before dropping back. Meanwhile, CoinDesk Data’s latest Exchange Review report revealed that Binance saw $2.63 trillion in futures trading volume last month, a new monthly record.

With BNB Price Prediction models pointing to a breakout, XRP News tracking resistance levels, and SOL Price Updates tied to fresh institutional developments, traders are watching closely. Meanwhile, new altcoins like Remittix are trending as investors seek real utility and long-term growth opportunities beyond hype. BNB Price Holds Strong Above Key Support Binance Coin is attracting attention as it trades firmly above $874, holding steady after bouncing from its $840 base earlier this month. Current BNB Price today sits near resistance at $885, and traders see a potential breakout toward $900 if momentum holds. Institutional interest continues to boost sentiment, with corporate treasuries and token burns adding long-term strength. For now, the BNB Price Prediction hinges on clearing $885 before aiming for $920. XRP News Tracks Market Reaction To Speculative Claims XRP continues to generate debate as speculation swirls about a possible move to $5, though analysts caution the excitement may be premature. XRP Price today sits near $2.81, with trading volume above $5.5 billion, but a 78% rally within weeks would require significant catalysts. XRP News highlights ongoing regulatory challenges with the SEC, making the path uncertain. For now, most XRP Price Prediction models suggest sideways trading between $2.70 and $3.10. Investors Track Solana Price As TradFi Adoption Expands Solana has captured investor attention once again with fresh institutional news adding weight to its bullish case. SOL Strategies, a Canadian firm dedicated to the Solana ecosystem, will begin trading on Nasdaq under the ticker STKE on September 9. This move has been hailed as a major milestone for the blockchain, opening doors for more institutional capital. With the SOL Price today steady above $200, analysts see the listing as a boost for long-term growth. Meanwhile, Kazakhstan launched the first Solana ETF with staking, further fueling optimism. Together, these developments strengthen the outlook for Solana, with investors watching closely for signs of momentum building toward higher targets.

The Technical Foundation Behind the $5.89 Target The projection is rooted in classical technical analysis principles. $589’s outlook aligns with other independent chartists who have highlighted the significance of XRP’s current trading range. My professional technical analysis says #XRP is headed to $5.89+ this month. pic.twitter.com/jlZ2HF0F6z — $589 (@589CTO) September 8, 2025 Currently, XRP is trading steadily between $2.90 and $3.00, a range many consider a key turning point. For the bullish trajectory to materialize, analysts argue that the token must first close decisively above the $3.30 to $3.40 resistance zone. If that breakout is achieved with strong trading volume, historical measured-move techniques, Fibonacci extensions, and harmonic projections suggest XRP could extend toward the $5.80 to $6.00 region. One detailed market analysis even set a $5.85 target after a confirmed breakout at $3.33, underscoring how closely these technical frameworks align with $589’s forecast. The convergence of such projections lends credibility to the idea that XRP has a technically defensible path to the mid-$5 range. Market Conditions Supporting a Bullish Breakout Beyond chart formations, broader market conditions also provide context for the prediction. Whale accumulation has increased in recent weeks, while on-chain trackers report consistent exchange outflows of XRP. This dynamic reduces available supply on trading venues and can intensify upward price pressure when demand rises. Coupled with improving sentiment in the wider cryptocurrency market, these flows suggest that momentum could shift quickly once resistance levels are cleared. Bitcoin’s ongoing stability above the $110,000 threshold and renewed optimism around altcoins add further fuel to the bullish case. When market liquidity shifts toward top-valued altcoins, XRP often gains as it’s among the most liquid and widely held tokens. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Timing the Move: Why “This Month” Matters By framing the projection within this month, $589 suggests an imminent acceleration in XRP’s price action. For that to happen, certain conditions must align in the coming weeks: a strong daily close above $3.30, follow-through beyond the intermediate barrier at $3.80 to $4.10, and a supportive macro backdrop that maintains risk-on momentum. If these milestones are achieved early, a swift rally toward $5.89 becomes a realistic near-term outcome. Potential Risks to the Upside Scenario Despite the optimism, traders are reminded to consider the risks that could derail such a move. Large-scale profit-taking by early entrants or negative macroeconomic news could also blunt the momentum required for a sustained breakout. $589’s call for XRP to hit $5.89 or more this month is bold, precise, and grounded in recognizable technical analysis frameworks. The setup is clear: consolidation near $3.00, a breakout requirement above $3.30 , and measured projections pointing to the mid-$5 range. Whether these conditions align swiftly enough remains uncertain, but the forecast has added fresh energy to XRP discussions, offering traders both a technical roadmap and a timeframe to watch closely.

Secure Your Wallet: Ensure your cryptocurrency wallet is secure. Use strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and never share your private keys. Start Small (if possible): During the initial test migration, consider swapping a small amount first to familiarize yourself with the process before migrating your entire holdings. Monitor Gas Fees: While the swap ratio is 1:1, be mindful of any network transaction fees (gas fees) that might apply during the process. Being prepared and cautious will help you navigate this transition effectively and safely.

BetPokies NZ founder himself, John Gold, mentioned a couple of times that his reason for founding the platform was to create a platform that would be good enough for players’ needs and give them answers to any kind of question they would be waiting for. Speaking in general terms, it looks like the platform, being now operated by ZehrMedia LTD , has succeeded in that since now you will be free to see loads of useful guides, reviews, and analysis articles that indeed talk about everything connected with gambling from payment providers, types of casinos, etc. In addition to that, that platform itself was recently relaunched with a mission to provide New Zealand players with that top-grade content. BetPokies’ Team — A Team Built for Quality Behind BetPokies is a team of seasoned experts who ensure that every guide, review, and article is both accurate and easy to understand. From the very beginning, founder John Gold understood that success in the gambling information space comes down to trust — and trust can only be earned through quality. That’s why he assembled a group of professionals who not only have industry knowledge but also share his commitment to transparency and precision. The editorial team is led by Oliver Singh, who makes sure that complex gambling topics are explained in a way that every reader can grasp, whether they are complete beginners or experienced players. Charlotte Wilson contributes original, in-depth content that dives into payment systems, bonuses, and casino features, providing insights players won’t find on standard affiliate sites. Equally important are BetPokies’ manual testers, a dedicated group who go through casinos step by step — signing up, claiming bonuses, playing games, and even withdrawing winnings. By documenting every stage of the player journey, they ensure that no detail is overlooked and that readers receive recommendations based on real experiences, not marketing promises. This blend of editorial expertise and hands-on testing creates content that is practical, trustworthy, and highly valued by the community. It’s this attention to detail and player-first approach that sets BetPokies apart from other gambling guides. Instead of relying on copied information or promotional material, the team delivers insights that players can rely on when making decisions about where to play and how to play smarter. Relaunching With Players in Mind In March 2025, BetPokies NZ underwent a significant relaunch that marked a new chapter in the platform’s development. The redesign wasn’t just about giving the website a modern look, it was about rethinking how players interact with content and how the site could better serve its growing community. The relaunch introduced personal accounts, giving users the ability to customise their experience, track favourite casinos, and leave their own reviews. This move made BetPokies NZ far more interactive, turning it into a two-way conversation between the platform and its audience. The addition of community-driven reviews means that players can share first-hand experiences, while the automatic casino ranking system provides up-to-date evaluations that reflect both expert testing and real user feedback. Another highlight of the relaunch is the weekly bonus subscription feature, allowing players to receive fresh bonus updates directly, ensuring they never miss an opportunity. Combined with enhanced navigation, mobile optimisation, and new content formats, the relaunch has turned BetPokies NZ into not just a review hub, but a dynamic platform where Kiwi gamblers can learn, contribute, and stay ahead of industry trends. The Future of BetPokies NZ Looking ahead, the vision for BetPokies NZ is ambitious yet clear: to become the ultimate one-stop reference point for New Zealand players. Founder John Gold and his team remain committed to ensuring that the platform continues to evolve alongside the fast-changing iGaming landscape. Future developments will focus on expanding the library of guides, covering not just casinos and bonuses, but also in-depth looks at payment methods, responsible gambling strategies, and emerging trends in online gaming. BetPokies NZ also plans to introduce more interactive tools, such as comparison features, personalised recommendations, and advanced filtering options that help users quickly find what they need. At its core, the platform will always prioritise transparency, trust, and player value. Whether you’re a newcomer taking your first steps in online gambling or a seasoned player searching for deeper insights, BetPokies NZ aims to provide resources that are not only informative but also empowering. With its mix of expert analysis, community contributions, and continuous innovation, BetPokies NZ is set to remain the go-to destination for Kiwi players long into the future.

Recently, a significant development in the fight against cybercrime emerged: the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has taken decisive action, filing for the forfeiture of over $5 million in Bitcoin (BTC) linked to a sophisticated SIM-swapping scam . This move underscores the ongoing battle to secure digital assets and protect individuals from increasingly cunning fraudsters. Understanding the Devious SIM-Swapping Scam What exactly is a SIM-swapping scam , and why should every cryptocurrency holder be aware of it? At its core, a SIM-swapping scam is a malicious attack where perpetrators gain control of a victim’s phone number. They achieve this by tricking a mobile carrier into transferring the victim’s phone number to a SIM card controlled by the scammer. This might involve social engineering tactics, impersonation, or exploiting vulnerabilities within the carrier’s systems. Once they control your phone number, the attackers can intercept critical communications, including one-time passwords (OTPs) and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes. These codes are often the last line of defense for accessing online accounts, especially cryptocurrency exchanges, banking portals, and email. Imagine waking up to find your digital life compromised, simply because someone gained access to your phone number. It’s a chilling thought, and unfortunately, a reality for many victims. How it Works: Scammers contact your mobile carrier, pretending to be you. The Goal: To port your phone number to their SIM card. The Impact: They gain access to your SMS, calls, and crucial 2FA codes. The DOJ’s Decisive Blow Against Crypto SIM-Swapping Scammers This latest action by the U.S. Department of Justice represents a significant victory against digital asset theft. The filing for the forfeiture of more than $5 million in BTC sends a clear message: law enforcement agencies are actively pursuing those who exploit technological vulnerabilities to steal cryptocurrencies. This particular forfeiture stems from a complex SIM-swapping scam that resulted in substantial financial losses for victims. The successful tracking and seizure of these illicit funds highlight the increasing sophistication of investigative techniques in the blockchain space. While the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies can offer anonymity, transactions are recorded on an immutable ledger, often leaving a trail for determined investigators. This case serves as a powerful reminder that even in the digital realm, justice can and will be pursued. This initiative not only recovers stolen assets but also acts as a deterrent. It shows that engaging in a SIM-swapping scam carries serious consequences, making it a riskier endeavor for potential criminals. It reinforces trust in the digital ecosystem by demonstrating that authorities are committed to protecting users. Safeguarding Your Assets: Defending Against SIM-Swapping Scams Given the pervasive threat of a SIM-swapping scam , what steps can you take to protect your valuable digital assets? Proactive security measures are crucial. Your first line of defense should always be to secure your mobile account. Here are some essential tips to safeguard yourself: Enable a Strong PIN/Password on Your Mobile Account: Contact your carrier and set up a unique PIN or password for your account. This makes it harder for scammers to authorize changes without this specific code. Use Authenticator Apps for 2FA: Whenever possible, opt for app-based two-factor authentication (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy) instead of SMS-based 2FA. Authenticator apps generate codes that are tied to your device, not your phone number, making them immune to SIM swaps. Be Wary of Phishing Attempts: Scammers often gather personal information through phishing emails or texts. Never click suspicious links or provide personal details unless you are certain of the sender’s legitimacy. Monitor Your Accounts: Regularly check your phone service and financial accounts for any unusual activity. Early detection can prevent significant losses. Consider a Hardware Wallet: For substantial cryptocurrency holdings, a hardware wallet offers the highest level of security by keeping your private keys offline. Vigilance is key in the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats. By adopting these security practices, you significantly reduce your vulnerability to a SIM-swapping scam and other forms of digital theft. A Crucial Victory in the Fight Against Cybercrime The U.S. DOJ’s successful action to forfeit over $5 million in Bitcoin from a SIM-swapping scam is more than just a legal procedure; it’s a critical moment for digital asset security. It highlights the persistent danger of these sophisticated attacks while simultaneously showcasing the increasing effectiveness of law enforcement in combating them. As the digital economy continues to grow, the responsibility to protect our assets falls on both individuals and institutions. This case serves as a powerful reminder that while the rewards of the crypto world are enticing, a proactive and informed approach to security is paramount. Stay informed, stay secure, and protect your digital future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some common questions regarding SIM-swapping scams and cryptocurrency security: Q1: What is the primary goal of a SIM-swapping scammer? A1: The primary goal is to gain control of your phone number to intercept crucial communications, especially two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, which allows them to access your online accounts, including cryptocurrency exchanges and banking services. Q2: How can I tell if I’m a victim of a SIM-swapping scam? A2: Signs include sudden loss of cell service, inability to make or receive calls/texts, or notifications of unauthorized account changes. If you suspect a SIM swap, contact your mobile carrier and financial institutions immediately. Q3: Are hardware wallets truly effective against SIM-swapping scams? A3: Yes, hardware wallets are highly effective. They store your private keys offline, meaning even if a scammer gains access to your online accounts, they cannot move your cryptocurrency without physical access to your hardware wallet and its PIN. Q4: Does the U.S. DOJ typically recover stolen cryptocurrencies? A4: The U.S. DOJ and other law enforcement agencies are increasingly successful in tracking and recovering stolen cryptocurrencies, especially from high-profile scams. This recent forfeiture of over $5 million in BTC is a prime example of their ongoing efforts. Q5: What’s the most important step to prevent a SIM-swapping scam? A5: The most important step is to enable a strong, unique PIN or password directly with your mobile carrier for your account. This prevents unauthorized SIM transfers without that specific credential. Additionally, prioritize app-based 2FA over SMS-based whenever possible.

51457431,https://invezz.com/?p=2868607,1757438206,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,KuCoin pushes crypto into commerce with on-chain payments for SMEs,https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/09/kucoin-pushes-crypto-into-commerce-with-on-chain-payments-for-smes/,"KuCoin has thrown its weight behind the practical crypto adoption narrative, launching its “On-chain payment solution” through KuCoin Pay that enables direct wallet-to-wallet transactions without traditional payment processors getting in the way. The timing feels deliberate. While much of the crypto industry remains focused on trading and speculation, KuCoin is positioning itself where the real money might be: helping businesses actually use digital currencies for commerce. The exchange’s new system supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, and USDC, with instant settlement and users covering only network gas fees. White-label solution empowers small and medium businesses What makes this interesting isn’t just the technology, it’s the target market. KuCoin isn’t chasing enterprise giants like Stripe or PayPal typically do. Instead, they are going after small and medium businesses with a white-label solution that lets merchants integrate crypto payments without building infrastructure from scratch. That’s smart positioning in a space where technical complexity has been a major adoption barrier. The value proposition for SMEs is straightforward: no chargebacks, reduced fraud risk, and access to a growing base of crypto users willing to spend their digital assets. For businesses already dealing with international customers, the borderless nature of crypto payments could eliminate costly currency conversions and multi-day settlement periods that plague traditional cross-border transactions. From a business perspective, KuCoin appears to be making a calculated play for market share before larger fintech companies fully embrace on-chain payments. The white-label approach is particularly clever as it allows smaller businesses to offer modern payment options while KuCoin handles the regulatory compliance and technical infrastructure. Technical execution meets regulatory reality KuCoin Pay operates within the exchange’s regulated ecosystem and includes comprehensive AML compliance systems. This regulatory framework could prove crucial as governments worldwide continue developing crypto payment oversight. Kumiko Ho, who heads KuCoin’s payment division said: This On-Chain Payment Solution marks a pivotal advancement in bridging cryptocurrency with everyday commerce. With its turnkey white-label capabilities, it empowers merchants to integrate crypto payments effortlessly while maintaining brand integrity. “By prioritizing direct, secure, and cost-effective transactions, we’re not only enhancing trust and efficiency but also driving responsible innovation to make crypto accessible for all,” Ho added. The real test won’t be the technology itself, but whether KuCoin can convince merchants that crypto payments represent a genuine competitive advantage rather than just a novelty feature. With traditional payment processing margins under pressure and cross-border commerce growing, the timing might be right for businesses to seriously consider blockchain-based alternatives. Success will likely depend on execution: how seamlessly merchants can integrate the system, how reliably it performs under load, and whether customers actually want to spend their crypto holdings on everyday purchases.

It’s About Treasuries,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/09/09/washington-s-crypto-pivot-isn-t-about-silicon-valley-it-s-about-treasuries,"Much ado has been made about U.S. President Donald Trump’s open-armed embrace of crypto. One theory is that the White House’s friendliness toward digital assets is a favor to Silicon Valley donors , a gesture to innovation-friendly constituencies. Another is that it reflects an administrative belief in the efficiency gains that blockchain can bring to payments . Both explanations may hold some truth. But they miss a more pressing, and under-analyzed, reason: America has a debt problem . And the challenge isn’t just how much the U.S. owes ( $37 trillion and counting ), either — it’s who will keep buying that debt. Foreign buyers of U.S. Treasuries — long the dependable stalwarts of American borrowing — are pulling back. Among other examples, China’s holdings dropped to their lowest since 2009 , while Japan, once the largest foreign holder, has been trimming too . With interest rates still above 4%, Washington is scrambling for new sources of demand. Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, who describes himself first and foremost as America’s bond salesman, believes he has found a steady source in crypto. His unlikely new customers: stablecoins. Stablecoins as Treasury Buyers Stablecoins — digital tokens pegged to the dollar — now represent one of the fastest-growing sources of U.S. debt demand . To understand why this is significant, it’s important first to understand the math: every $1 deposited into stablecoins results in roughly $0.90 flowing into Treasuries. Compare that with U.S. bank deposits, where only ~11% of funds ultimately cycle into Treasuries. The difference is stark. Put another way, the game plan is quite simple: every dollar that flows out of a bank deposit and into a stablecoin yields about $0.79 in net new Treasury demand. This explains how Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, became a top-20 holder of Treasuries — with over $125bn in U.S. debt. Circle, which issues USDC, is not far behind . Together, they now hold more Treasuries than some sovereigns, ranking around the 18th largest holder worldwide. In short: stablecoins are not just a tool for crypto traders. They’ve become a uniquely efficient channel for Treasury demand. Clearing the Runway It seems like no accident, then, that the Trump administration has cleared the runway for a domestic stablecoin boom. The GENIUS Act , passed in July, requires stablecoins to be backed one-for-one with cash or short-term Treasuries — effectively channeling inflows into government debt. A companion Digital Asset Market Clarity Act promises the first federal rulebook for crypto investment. Bessent himself has not been shy about this topic, publicly calling stablecoins a way to boost demand for U.S. government debt and cement U.S. Dollar dominance globally . Other steps from the administration seem to support this theory and strategy as well. A Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and broader U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile , seeded with crypto seized by law enforcement, signaled that the government views digital assets as part of its financial toolkit. Additionally, a recent executive order barred banks from blocking crypto transactions , lowering friction for both retail and institutions. Another rule change opened the door for 401(k) retirement savings to invest in digital assets , creating a powerful new capital channel. Each initiative reduces the perceived risk of crypto, draws in new participants, and ultimately pushes more dollars into stablecoins — and by extension, into Treasuries. Pitfalls and Risks For all its momentum, Bessent’s strategy is not without hazards. Stablecoins are still small relative to the $50 trillion U.S. financial system, and their demand can be fickle. If sentiment turns or crypto adoption stalls, the Treasury bid could shrink just as quickly as it has grown, leaving Washington once again searching for buyers. Even if growth continues, the mechanics of stablecoin reserves carry distortive effects. Because issuers are restricted to holding only cash and short-term Treasuries, their rise channels demand almost exclusively to the front end of the yield curve. That concentration tilts issuance away from longer-dated bonds and may reshape the maturity profile of U.S. debt in ways policymakers weren’t expecting. Finally, banks are unlikely to cede ground quietly. Deposit flight into stablecoins is a direct threat to their business model, which depends on capturing the yield on U.S. dollars. That is precisely why the GENIUS Act prohibits issuers from offering yield-bearing tokens. But workarounds are already being explored, setting up a competitive fight over who earns the yield on the dollars backing the stablecoin. Conclusion The prevailing narrative is that Trump’s crypto pivot is about innovation or pandering to Silicon Valley. The reality looks more pragmatic — and more urgent. Stablecoins are being positioned as a Trojan horse for Treasury demand, one that channels global dollars into U.S. debt more efficiently than banks or foreign sovereigns. Whether this gambit succeeds or inflates another bubble remains to be seen. But it reframes the crypto debate: in Washington’s eyes, stablecoins are not a sideshow. They may be the ballast keeping America’s debt machine afloat.",Opinion|Scott Bessent|US Treasury|Trump Administration|Opinion,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|FIAT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-09 17:16:57

Our Pi network price prediction anticipates the Pi price to reach a maximum level of $0.4232 by 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $4.74. Pi Network, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan, is a social cryptocurrency and developer ecosystem built for accessibility and real-world utility. The Pi Network is entering a crucial stage in 2025 as its ecosystem expands, but market sentiment stays cautious. Pi Coin recently hit an all-time low of $0.3304 on August 26, 2025, months after peaking at $2.98 in February, highlighting its volatile price action within the crypto market. Despite this, the network is moving forward with completing key developments. The Passkey Update introduced Face ID, fingerprint, and device PIN authentication, strengthening security ahead of the long-awaited Mainnet launch. At the same time, Pi Hackathon 2025 opened the door for developers to build real-world services and apps, while early seed investor Ulu Ventures confirmed its backing as an indication of continued confidence in Pi’s future. In this article on Pi Network price prediction, we look at recent trends, ecosystem development, and both technical and fundamental factors that could determine Pi coin value between 2025 and 2031.

Pi Network gained 0.46% in the past 24 hours. PI coin faces resistance near $0.40. On September 9, 2025, Pi Network price analysis revealed a small upward move for the day. The altcoin’s price increased to $0.3457 in the past 24 hours, resulting in a 0.46% gain in its value. Buyers have attempted to stabilise the market after weeks of weakness, although resistance continues to appear around the $0.40 level, where multiple rejections have limited upside momentum. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis The 24-hour chart of Pi Network confirms a weak consolidation phase. PI/USD traded with small green candlesticks, showing limited buying activity. The token’s value has held close to $0.3457, far below its earlier surge above $1.00 earlier in the year. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 44.54, positioned in the lower neutral zone. This suggests weak demand, with neither bulls nor bears in clear control. The RSI’s flat trajectory signals a lack of strong momentum. Pi/Usdt Chart: Tradingview The MACD shows slight bullishness, with the line at 0.0014, just edging above the signal at –0.0116. The histogram remains shallow, which highlights the absence of significant market strength. Immediate resistance is visible near $0.40, while support is forming at $0.30, a level repeatedly tested over recent weeks. Pi/USD 4-Hour Price Analysis The 4-hour price chart of Pi Network shows stable trading as PI/USD is trading at $0.3452, showing a decline of 0.06%. Price action has remained in a range of between $0.34 and $0.35, with both bulls and bears showing hesitation. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is recorded at 50.06, placing it almost at the midpoint of the neutral zone. This shows market indecision, as buying and selling pressure are nearly balanced. The RSI curve is flattening, which points toward consolidation rather than a clear trend. Pi/Usdt Chart: Tradingview The MACD line on the 4-hour chart is currently at 0.0003, above the signal line at –0.0005, hinting at weak bullish momentum. However, the histogram shows minimal bars, suggesting that trading volume and volatility remain low in the short-term view. Resistance is sitting near $0.35–0.36, and immediate support is at $0.34. A breakout from this narrow range will likely set the tone for PI’s next move. Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.459391 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.399609 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.41196 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.43039 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.377452 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.405065 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.470548 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.588556 SELL What to expect from the Pi price analysis next? From the Pi price analysis, the coin is likely to continue consolidating between $0.3420 support and $0.3456 resistance in the short term. A breakout above resistance could trigger a way toward $0.351, while a drop below support may cause further downside momentum. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.3610 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly, neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is PI’s price down today? Pi Network (PI) is down today as upcoming token unlocks raise supply concerns, adding to selling pressure in a weak crypto market. Bearish technical factors like broken support levels, oversold RSI, and negative MACD confirm a fragile price action outlook. Broader market fear and low liquidity further weigh on sentiment, leaving investors cautious about Pi’s near-term value. Will Pi Price Reach $5? If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $5 mark. Will Pi Reach $10? Depending on the current market sentiment, the PI price might take several years to reach the $10 milestone. We expect the Pi price to reach $10 by 2033.

This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi shows sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72 if support at $0.60 holds.

The buyer’s ambitious plan? To accumulate 1 billion DOGE within just 30 days. This milestone represents one of the largest treasury-style acquisitions in Dogecoin’s history, sending shockwaves through both the crypto community and traditional markets. From Meme Coin to Treasury Asset Once viewed as a lighthearted internet joke, Dogecoin is now gaining legitimacy as a serious treasury asset. The bold accumulation strategy shows growing institutional confidence that DOGE can serve as more than just a speculative token. The plan to build a billion-DOGE reserve underscores Dogecoin’s transformation into an asset with long-term strategic value. Investors are now looking beyond the memes, recognizing DOGE’s speed, low transaction costs, and growing adoption in payments and tipping platforms. DOGE and Stocks Surge The acquisition sparked immediate market reactions. Dogecoin itself climbed by nearly 32% following the news, trading higher on increased demand. Meanwhile, the stock of the acquiring company surged by 38%, signaling strong investor enthusiasm for DOGE’s growing role in corporate treasury strategies. This dual market response shows that Dogecoin is no longer just a retail-driven asset — institutional interest is increasingly shaping its trajectory. Why DOGE’s Billion-Token Goal Matters Legitimacy Boost – A billion-DOGE treasury marks Dogecoin’s arrival as a recognized store of value. Supply Impact – Massive accumulation reduces circulating supply, potentially tightening the market. Utility Growth – DOGE continues to be integrated into payments, remittances, and digital tipping systems. Corporate Precedent – A successful treasury strategy could inspire other companies to follow. With institutional players showing confidence, retail adoption expanding, and supply tightening, the stage is set for Dogecoin’s next major breakout.

Over the past week analysts have shifted attention to a new cross-border payments player, Remittix , that rivals DOGE in community buzz and may deliver far greater upside. Interest in traditional meme coins is cooling, as crypto markets pivot to solutions that solve real-world problems. Amid this shift, this new altcoin has emerged as a standout, combining low gas fees, DeFi staking rewards, a real-world payment network, and imminent centralized exchange listing news. Dogecoin News: Meme Coin Momentum and Analyst Outlook Recent Dogecoin news shows renewed interest driven by potential ETF approvals and whale accumulation. Analysts on X note that DOGE is forming a bullish rounding-bottom pattern within a symmetrical triangle, hinting at a breakout if support near $0.21 holds. Dogecoin currently trades around $0.232, with strong technical resistance in the $0.24–$0.25 range. $0.209 is the key support for Dogecoin and has been tested five times already. Analysts cite whale activity, including a massive $230 million acquisition, as evidence of demand and possible momentum for a move toward $0.30 or higher. Remittix’s Innovation and Ecosystem A fresh altcoin with growing traction, Remittix introduces a payments-first DeFi platform tailored to cross-border transfers. Its upcoming mobile-first wallet, to launch in Q3 2025, supports over 40 cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies with real-time FX conversion and low gas fees. Analyst sentiment suggests Remittix offers far greater upside driven by real-world adoption and CEX liquidity, in contrast to uncertain DOGE and scalably constrained ETH and XRP Key Highlights of Remittix ● Utility-first token powering real transaction volume● Real-World Utility: Built for actual payments use, not just speculation● Security First: Audited by CertiK, one of the top blockchain security firms● Momentum is building ahead of wallet launch These features combine to position Remittix as a standout in low gas fee crypto and pay-utility focus, making it one of the best crypto presale 2025 projects and a next big altcoin 2025 target Remittix runs a $250,000 giveaway to reward early adopters. The first centralized exchange listing is confirmed on BitMart after hitting $20 million in raise; a second listing on LBankfollowed after crossing $22 million. A third listing announcement is expected soon and Remittix has surpassed $24.6 million. Why Remittix Is More Than Hype As Dogecoin cycles through meme-driven rallies and Ethereum wrestles with fees, Remittixpresents a clear, utility-backed alternative. With audited security, broad utility spanning 30+ countries, confirmed centralized exchange listings, a global wallet launch, and community incentives—it’s not just hype. Investing in Remittix now means engaging with a transformative PayFi ecosystem aimed at solving real problems. Its low gas fee crypto model, staking rewards, and referral incentives create passive income opportunities. With momentum building ahead of the wallet launch, the project is positioned for accelerated adoption.

Yet, trading activity has been eerily quiet while a growing wave of newer investors is leaning toward projects with fresh narratives. In fact, recent sentiment charts and polls indicate that more than 50% of new crypto buyers favour Remittix (RTX) over ADA as their preferred entry point. This shift signals that while Cardano remains respected, investor capital may be pivoting toward “PayFi”, and Remittix is at the front of that curve. Cardano’s Market Standing: Stable, but Unspectacular Cardano is currently trading around $0.82, holding near long-term support. Its upgrades, like the Alonzo Hydra update, have kept the ecosystem functional, but price action has been range-bound for months. Analyst commentary often calls Cardano a “steady performer,” while admitting it’s lacking the momentum new entrants often bring to the table. Drafting new pools or governance plans continues, but many new investors seem to be watching without a breakout narrative instead of jumping in. Compared to the splashier stories emerging from newer projects, Cardano’s appeal feels quieter: solid, but less electrifying. Polls Reveal a Clear Market Sentiment Shift A recent industry poll (tracked across social and Telegram channels) shows that over half of new crypto investors prefer Remittix over Cardano, drawn by PayFi's positioning, presale momentum, and exchange promise. While these are early-stage numbers, they reflect what people put real money behind, not just retweeting. One community trader said, “People know ADA’s legit, but maybe too legit for quick gains.” That statement captures the mood: new money wants stories, not established foundations. Here's why Remittix is captivating new investors, making it stand out as the favoured alternative: ● Presale price is currently $0.105 per token, giving early entrants a sharp entry compared to mid-cap altcoins.● Over 652 million tokens sold, signalling strong demand from early-stage buyers. ● Surpassed $24.6 million in raised funds, catching meaningful capital, not just hype.● Deals are in place with BitMart and LBank CEXs, offering legit liquidity pathways.● A beta wallet will launch in Q3 2025, supporting 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiat currencies, which is critical for PayFi use cases.● Voted by traders on X as the best crypto to buy now, even ahead of ADA and XRP. These aren't empty promises. They’re strategic groundwork and execution that investors can see and evaluate, which is fueling the shift in sentiment. What this Means for Cardano and Market Positioning For those steady on ADA, the fundamentals remain strong. Cardano’s ecosystem is solid, partnerships continue slowly building, and governance progress remains steady. But sentiment is data-driven. If new capital pipelines consistently favour projects like Remittix, that could signal evolving allocation strategies in the crypto cycle. Some early adopters are hedging, maintaining ADA positions while allocating a small portion to Remittix to capture upside potential in PayFi. That “best of both worlds” stance is common in trader discussions.

Enhanced User Experience: Expect smoother gameplay, quicker access to features, and a generally more responsive and seamless interaction with ApeCoin-powered platforms. New Possibilities: Developers can leverage Solana’s robust technology to create innovative applications and services. This could significantly expand the utility and reach of ApeCoin Solana , fostering a new wave of creativity. This integration is set to make the ApeCoin experience more enjoyable and less financially burdensome. Navigating the Path Forward: Challenges and Opportunities for ApeCoin on Solana While the move to Solana presents exciting opportunities, it also comes with its own set of considerations. Any major blockchain expansion involves careful planning and execution. Potential challenges include: User Migration: Guiding existing ApeCoin users from Ethereum to the new Solana infrastructure will require clear communication and support. Security Considerations: Ensuring the robustness and security of the new integration is paramount to maintaining user trust.

ApeCoin can tap into Solana’s active user base and benefit from its growing developer community. This could lead to new partnerships and cross-chain collaborations, solidifying ApeCoin’s position as a leading token in the Web3 gaming and metaverse sectors. The ApeCoin Solana synergy could indeed set a powerful precedent for other projects looking to scale. A New Horizon for ApeCoin The expansion of ApeCoin Solana marks a significant milestone in its journey. By embracing Solana’s speed, efficiency, and lower costs, ApeCoin is poised to offer a superior experience to its community. This move not only addresses current limitations but also unlocks a future filled with innovative possibilities for NFTs, gaming, and the broader Web3 landscape. It’s a clear statement that ApeCoin is committed to evolving and leading the charge in decentralized innovation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is ApeCoin (APE)?

(TMTG), the company behind Truth Social, has shifted direction on its digital asset strategy, opting to integrate Crypto.com’s Cronos (CRO) token rather than launching its own utility token. The update, announced Tuesday, introduces a series of new features to the Truth Social platform, including premium tools for subscribers to its Patriot Package, the paid tier of Truth+ streaming. Among the additions are the ability to edit posts, schedule content, save server-side drafts, and access a version history of published posts. Group titles and enhanced search functions are also being rolled out to all users. Truth Social Rewards Go Crypto as CRO Replaces In-House Token Plans A central part of the release is the expansion of Truth Social’s rewards program. Under the new system, users can earn “gems” for activity across Truth Social and Truth+. These gems can now be converted into Cronos (CRO) through Crypto.com’s digital wallet infrastructure, giving participants the option to redeem those gems for a tradable cryptocurrency rather than a proprietary Trump Media token. Step by step — $CRO utility growing every day. https://t.co/LE4LXX32n4 — Kris | Crypto.com (@kris) September 9, 2025 The move comes months after TMTG indicated plans to launch a native utility token. In April, CEO Devin Nunes told shareholders that the company was considering a token that could be used to pay for subscriptions to Truth+ and potentially expand across the broader Truth ecosystem. The proposal stopped short of describing the asset as a cryptocurrency, but the language echoed blockchain terminology. At the time, Nunes said the token would support a rewards program tied to the Patriot Package. In July, Truth Social confirmed the testing of a digital rewards system , with Patriot Package subscribers able to accumulate gems based on platform activity. Trump Media and Truth Social are expanding crypto involvement through user incentives and investment products. #trump #etf https://t.co/2wWgeH8EdQ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 10, 2025 A post from the company suggested these rewards would eventually connect to a utility token. That plan has now shifted, with Crypto.com’s Cronos becoming the digital currency behind the program. Trump Media’s shift to CRO comes as the company seeks to balance its push into digital assets with regulatory caution. Unlike a self-issued token, partnering with an established exchange and blockchain provider gives Truth Social access to existing infrastructure while avoiding the risks of launching and maintaining its own cryptocurrency. Truth Social trades publicly under the ticker DJT. Following a March 2024 listing, the firm was valued at nearly $8 billion. Its market capitalization currently sits around $5.5 billion. Despite limited revenues, the company has maintained momentum through brand recognition, its association with U.S. President Donald Trump, and expansion into streaming via Truth+. The company also operates Truth.Fi, a fintech division launched in January to pursue investments in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as part of a broader digital finance strategy. TMTG has previously described its mission as building a platform to counter what it calls “Big Tech censorship,” with Truth Social positioned as an alternative to mainstream social networks. Trump Media Strikes $105M Deal With Crypto.com as Pro-Crypto Push Expands TMTG, the parent company of Truth Social, has finalized a $105 million deal with Crypto.com to purchase 684.4 million Cronos (CRO) tokens as part of a joint treasury strategy. We now officially begin our work to #MakeCROGreatAgain – Trump Media has completed its acquisition of 684.4 million CRO as part of our strategic partnership. CRO is now stored and staked with https://t.co/pFc4Pz9nFR Custody. https://t.co/9pcYYDvM2n — Kris | Crypto.com (@kris) September 5, 2025 The agreement, announced Friday, combines cash and stock, with tokens purchased at roughly $0.153 each. The CRO tokens and TMTG shares exchanged will be subject to a lockup period. The move follows the launch of the Trump Media Group CRO Strategy, a joint venture between TMTG, Crypto.com, and Yorkville Acquisition, which plans to build a $6.4 billion CRO treasury . Trump Media + https://t.co/U4D4dECttR strike a $6.4B deal to launch a CRO-focused digital asset treasury. #TrumpMedia #Crypto https://t.co/5gIiTqY49Z — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 26, 2025 Truth Social users may eventually gain access to CRO through a rewards program. CRO has climbed more than 66% since the treasury initiative was first unveiled in August, trading near $0.27 at the time of writing. The partnership shows Trump’s deepening ties with the crypto sector. Earlier this year, TMTG filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF , with Crypto.com serving as custodian. The ETF, which would allocate 75% to Bitcoin and 25% to Ethereum, remains under SEC review after regulators extended the deadline to October 8. TMTG has also positioned itself among the largest corporate Bitcoin holders, with about 18,430 BTC valued at $2.1 billion, along with $300 million in options . That holding ranks it sixth globally, ahead of Tesla and Coinbase. @realDonaldTrump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) has made a $300 million investment in options linked to Bitcoin-related securities. #Trump #Bitcoin https://t.co/9p7fbJQNQW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 28, 2025 Trump’s expanding $1.2 billion crypto empire has drawn both industry support and political criticism. Crypto companies and investors have donated over $26 million to his campaign in 2024 , including major contributions from Blockchain.com, Gemini, Andreessen Horowitz, and Paradigm. Critics, however, warn of conflicts of interest as the administration advances sweeping digital asset policies while family-linked ventures profit across stablecoins, meme coins, and mining projects.

Holders of established giants like XRP and Solana are actively turning their gaze, drawn by the irresistible siren call of an Ethereum Layer 2 meme coin presale promising an astronomical 50x gain. This isn’t just another flashy coin; Layer Brett marries raw meme power with serious blockchain utility, and its presale, currently offering tokens at just $0.0055, is ending sooner than you think, complete with an initial 850% APY staking reward. Layer Brett: A new dawn for meme coins Why are so many eyes on Layer Brett right now? Simple. While coins like Pepe, Shiba Inu, and Dogecoin have ridden pure hype, often struggling with Ethereum Layer 1’s slow speeds and eye-watering gas fees, Layer Brett is built differently. It’s a next-generation Layer 2 crypto, specifically designed to withstand congestion. Imagine practically instantaneous transactions, costing mere pennies. That’s the Layer Brett promise. It’s not just a meme; it’s a fully functional, high-speed ecosystem designed for genuine scalability. Layer Brett is the audacious evolution of a concept, breaking free from the limitations of the original Brett. Remember the first Brett on Base? It was a cultural hit, sure, but lacked any real utility. Layer Brett changes that game entirely, transforming into a purpose-built Layer 2 blockchain solution on Ethereum. It’s where meme meets mechanism, where viral culture powers actual blockchain scaling. This isn’t some fly-by-night DeFi coin; it’s a meticulously planned ERC-20 token with a clear roadmap for staking, rewards, and eventually, crypto governance. How Layer Brett works: Speed, rewards, and low gas fees This project isn’t just about good vibes; it’s about superior technology. Layer Brett offers near-instant transactions and dramatically reduced gas fees by processing activity off-chain, all while maintaining Ethereum’s ironclad security. Say goodbye to the frustrations of high-fee chains that plague users of even popular chains like Solana or XRP. With Layer Brett, users can buy and stake $LBRETT in seconds using ETH, USDT, or BNB through MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Plus, early buyers can stake their tokens immediately for a jaw-dropping initial 850% APY. Talk about enhanced rewards! The Future Outlook: Solana News and XRP Price Prediction vs. Layer Brett’s Potential While the crypto market eagerly watches XRP price prediction movements and the latest Solana news for signs of a bull run, smart investors are seeking the next 100x altcoin. With its low entry price of $0.0055 and a fixed supply of 10 billion tokens, its market cap potential dwarfs its utility-free predecessors. Analysts are buzzing, forecasting Layer Brett could deliver immense gains, possibly hitting that coveted 50x mark in the upcoming crypto bull run of 2025. It’s simply a top gainer crypto in the making. Layer Brett isn’t just a meme coin; it’s a low-cap crypto gem with serious substance. It addresses real-world blockchain scalability issues while harnessing the powerful community spirit of meme culture. With its presale still active, offering early staking rewards and a chance to participate in a $1 million giveaway, the opportunity is palpable. Don’t let this next big crypto slip through your fingers. While XRP and Solana continue their journeys, Layer Brett is positioning itself as the best crypto to buy now, poised for truly explosive growth. Get in on the ground floor; the window to join the Layer Brett revolution is closing fast.

This rise was driven by Nasdaq-listed Eightco Holdings Inc.’s launch of a WLD digital asset treasury (DAT) through a $250 million private placement. Additionally, South Korea's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit, listed Worldcoin (WLD) as of today. Hourly chart showing the rise in WLD price. Eightco announced on Monday that it had purchased approximately 170 million shares of its common stock in a private placement for $250 million. The company also issued an additional $20 million worth of shares to BitMine, the world's largest institutional holder of Ethereum. According to the company's statement, the transaction was led by MOZAYYX, with participation from institutional investors such as World Foundation, Discovery Capital Management, GAMA, FalconX, Kraken, Pantera, GSR, Coinfund, Occam Crest, Diametric and Brevan Howard. Related News: Major Company Keeps Its Word: Buys Large Amount of Memecoin The World project, formerly known as Worldcoin, is being developed by Tools for Humanity, founded by Altman and Alex Blania. The project uses iris scans to verify identity and reward users with WLD tokens. This system is seen as a means of “proving humanity” in an era when the internet is overflowing with AI-powered bots. “These globes and iris scanning will be the standard in the future for distinguishing humans from bots,” technology analyst Dan Ives told CNBC. Ives was also appointed chairman of the board of directors of WLD, the treasury company founded by Eightco. WLD reached an all-time high of over $11 in March 2024. *This is not investment advice.

Yet experts increasingly tip Remittix as the crypto winner in 2025 thanks to its practical PayFi utility. As Solana holds its value amid network upgrades and whale support, Remittix gains momentum through real usage, beyond price action alone. The $250,000 giveaway and the Q3 wallet beta launch on September 15 reinforce that shift. Solana Price Gains Traction Near Support While Waiting For a Breakout Solana price continues consolidating around the $215 mark, with key resistance at $213 potentially paving the way to $250+ if broken. On-chain indicators show strong whale accumulation and growth in total value locked, justifying cautious optimism. Analysts note SOL’s triangle chart is compressing, and a breakout above $208 could lead to moves toward $217 or higher. That said, if Solana falls below $195, traders warn of a pullback toward $190 or lower. For those watching Solana, that makes current price stability a key decision point. Remittix Offers Clear Utility, Whereas the Solana Price is Speculative Remittix stands apart in this comparison. While Solana rides technical patterns and speculation, Remittix offers real utility in payments finance. That makes it a compelling alternative for investors seeking predictable adoption and also the crypto inner in 2025. Remittix has sold over 651 million tokens, trades at $0.105, and has raised over $24.6 million. It crossed $20 million, which enabled a BitMart listing, then passed $22 million for LBANK listing, with a third exchange now pending. These milestones suggest execution and reach beyond what Solana provides through hype alone. Here are five strengths that underscore Remittix’s appeal: ● Global payout rails are already integrated and expanding● Time-sensitive entry point before listings and parabolic growth● Utility first token powering real transaction volume● Mass market appeal beyond just the crypto crowd● Built for adoption, not speculation These points show Remittix is being positioned as a utility driver, versus Solana, whose value centres on technical setups and network buzz. Remittix Stands Out As 2025’s Winner Solana price remains firm at around $200, supported by whale interest, DeFi activity, and technical patterns suggesting a potential breakout toward $250+, but also risk of downside if key levels break. Yet Remittix, with its PayFi foundation, growing funding and exchange presence, and utility focus, is being tipped as the standout crypto winner in 2025. When comparing the stability of Solana with functional progress, Remittix emerges as a grounded and promising contender.

U.S. officials say crime gangs have trafficked hundreds of thousands of people into scam compounds in Southeast Asia, especially near the Thailand-Myanmar border. Lured by fake job ads, they’re trapped in debt and forced to run online scams. The people they target are pushed into bogus investments and other frauds. “Southeast Asia’s cyber scam industry not only threatens the well-being and financial security of Americans, but also subjects thousands of people to modern slavery,” said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence John K. Hurley. Operations involve money laundering and illegal gambling According to the Treasury, these operations do a bit of everything from laundering money and running illegal betting to coaxing people into bogus investment platforms. The workers carrying out these operations are often foreigners who have been trafficked, abused, and compelled to keep the fraud going from inside guarded sites. Among the targets are nine companies and individuals linked to Shwe Kokko, a frontier town in Karen State on Myanmar’s border with Thailand. Washington says the new measures are designed to cut off cash flows to networks that have thrived in territory controlled by militias and by the junta alike. At Shwe Kokko, recruiters lured people from many countries with fake job offers, then trapped and abused them, the Treasury said. They were forced to run online scams under debt bondage, faced violence, and were threatened with forced prostitution. U.S targeted Cambodia-based scams run by Chinese criminal networks The United States also sanctioned 10 entities in Cambodia. U.S. officials say centers run there by Chinese criminal networks have specialized in digital-currency swindles. Amnesty International has described some Cambodian compounds as resembling prisons and accused the government of turning a blind eye, allegations that officials in Phnom Penh deny. Fraud hubs have spread swiftly in Myanmar since the 2021 military coup, moving beyond areas long controlled by militias into places under direct junta authority, according to a report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. Shwe Kokko itself was set up in 2017 by Hong Kong–registered Yatai International Holdings Group together with the Karen National Army, an armed group allied with Myanmar’s military, the United States Institute of Peace has noted. Yatai is already under sanctions, and the KNA has previously been sanctioned. Weak response to China-linked fraud puts Americans at risk In July, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission said America’s response to a multibillion-dollar fraud industry tied to Chinese criminal organizations is “fragmented and under-resourced,” raising the risk that schemes will increasingly target U.S. residents and scale quickly with new technology. The commission said U.S. losses from China-linked fraud likely far exceeded $5 billion in 2024. It is an increase of about 40% from the prior year, with Americans becoming prime targets since the COVID-19 pandemic. The commission described scams connected to transnational syndicates involved in drug trafficking and money laundering. The groups reach Americans through text messages, social media, dating apps, and job sites. The report also said Beijing has used its own crackdown on scam centers to widen its law-enforcement footprint in Southeast Asia, potentially boosting China’s sway with regional governments and aiding intelligence work. “These things are industrial-scale fraud factories that are using some of the most modern technology available, and their use of that technology is allowing them to scale these things very quickly. … I don’t even think American law enforcement has figured out how to get their heads around this yet,” said USCC commissioner Mike Kuiken.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Cardano (ADA) are leading the charge with more and more attention around them in the DeFi arena. Mutuum Finance has already begun the sixth phase of its presale, with every token being worth $0.035. Stage 7 will see a price appreciation of 14.29% to $0.04. The project already has over $15.5 million in funds raised and has over 16,150 contributors. While established players like Cardano (ADA) continue to forge ahead in network development and adoption, the spotlight falls on Mutuum Finance as the next major player. Cardano Holds Steady as Market Eyes Fresh Catalysts Cardano (ADA) at $0.8262, trading between $0.8147 and $0.8295 today in a tight range. The token remains strong above the psychological $0.80 mark, a consolidation phase as investors seek new momentum drivers. Technical setups show focus on short-term breakout prospects, particularly if it manages to recover and sustain levels around $0.87. As the market corrects, new DeFi projects, such as Mutuum Finance, are beginning to attract growing attention looking to compete with Cardano’s prospects. Dual-layer DeFi Lending Protocol Market specialists highlight Mutuum Finance as a hybrid lending platform; a blend of Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer technologies. P2C is more convenient if users do not wish to be so active since it is fueled by smart contracts. P2P, however, has communication between the borrower and lender without the presence of intermediaries. MUTM is also much more adaptable, not to mention efficient, due to the unique double-layered architecture, which allows for the leveraging of high-risk products like meme coins. Mutuum Presale Momentum Finance Round 6 of MUTM token sale is a reflection of the strength of the project since it has already set a record of $15.5M. The project will be a full-fledged ecosystem with a stablecoin. It will be on the Ethereum blockchain so that it will be long-term secure and safe. The CertiK trust rating of the platform is 95.0 which might be reasonably thought to represent the project commitment to security and transparency. Dynamic Interest and Liquidity Control Mutuum changes interest rates on borrowing in accordance with use of markets. During times of excess funds in lending pools, rates are kept low to spur borrowing and utilize idle cash. During times of low liquidity, rates rise to prompt repayments and stimulate new deposits. For lenders who desire fixed expenses, there is a choice of fixed rate. This rate, agreed to when borrowing, is typically higher than the floating rate and may be altered if market circumstances stray far. $50,000 Bug Bounty Program To create a sense of confidence in the security framework of the platform, Mutuum Finance has launched a Bug Bounty Program with a cap of $50,000. The program weighs possible flaws on the basis of critical, major, minor or low severity to ensure proper risk prevention. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is topping the charts as one of the top altcoins this week and is leaving old-timers like Cardano (ADA) in its wake. Stage 6 tokens are worth $0.035, with Stage 7 set to increase by 14.29% to $0.04. The project has already garnered over $15.5M and welcomed 16,120+ contributors, reflecting strong investor demand. With a two-layer lending protocol, P2C & P2P, an upcoming Ethereum-based stablecoin, a CertiK trust rating of 95.0, and a $50K bug bounty, MUTM is combining innovation with security. Get in now in stage 6 and lock in a better price before the next presale hike.

For investors and enthusiasts keenly observing the intersection of AI and computing power, the introduction of the new Nvidia GPU , the Rubin CPX, marks a pivotal moment. This isn’t just another chip; it’s a dedicated engine for the future of AI, promising to unlock unprecedented capabilities in processing complex information. What is the Nvidia GPU Rubin CPX and Why Does It Matter? At the recent AI Infrastructure Summit, Nvidia unveiled its latest innovation: the Rubin CPX GPU. This groundbreaking chip is specifically engineered to tackle one of the most demanding challenges in artificial intelligence today – long-context inference. Imagine an AI model that can process and understand information equivalent to an entire novel, rather than just a few sentences. That’s the leap the Rubin CPX aims to achieve, designed for context windows exceeding one million tokens. This specialized Nvidia GPU is part of the upcoming Rubin series and represents a strategic evolution in how AI models interact with vast datasets. Its significance lies in its ability to enable more sophisticated and human-like AI interactions, moving beyond the limitations of previous hardware. Revolutionizing AI Inference : The Power of Long-Context AI The ability to handle extensive context is a game-changer for AI inference . Current AI models often struggle with maintaining coherence and relevance over very long sequences of data. The Rubin CPX addresses this head-on, optimizing the processing of large sequences of context. This capability is crucial for applications where understanding the broader narrative or an extensive code base is essential. For instance, in video generation, it means an AI can create a coherent, long-form video with a consistent storyline and character development, rather than short, disconnected clips. Similarly, in software development, it allows AI assistants to comprehend entire code repositories, offering more accurate suggestions, bug fixes, and even generating large blocks of functional code. This shift towards robust long-context AI is not just an incremental improvement; it’s a foundational change that expands the horizons of what AI can accomplish. Boosting Data Center AI Capabilities: A Strategic Move Nvidia’s approach with the Rubin CPX also emphasizes a ‘disaggregated inference’ infrastructure. This architecture allows for greater flexibility and scalability in how AI workloads are managed within data centers. By separating the processing of different aspects of an AI task, resources can be allocated more efficiently, leading to superior performance and cost-effectiveness.

Now, new and ambitious investors ask where the next major gains lie. Amid that search, Remittix(RTX) emerges as the place where you can reap the same results with practical utility. Its real-world payment model, increasing adoption, and upcoming incentives signal a fresh path beyond meme hype. Shiba Inu coin's legendary run tests patience today Shiba Inu Coin gained fame for delivering epic returns; some holders recall substantial gains. Yet today, Shiba Inu Coin faces pressure; it trades around $0.0000127, and its network activity on Shibarium has faded. Analysts still see potential scenarios for modest rebounds, but broad 100x rallies seem unlikely without new catalysts. Shiba Inu Coin’s legacy remains, but momentum is today’s question. PEPE’s explosive meme success may be behind us PEPE, a meme coin that once delivered massive fortunes, gave early holders hundreds of times their money back. Now PEPE shows signs of plateau, consolidating near support and drawing caution from veteran traders. While PEPE’s cult-like following persists, current signals suggest further surge potential is limited unless new excitement ignites. Remittix is where you can reap the same results with the PayFi utility While Shiba Inu Coin and PEPE rode meme waves, Remittix offers a different blueprint grounded in real payment utility. That contrast draws meme coin veterans looking for the next ground floor opportunity that can deliver similar or greater returns but with stronger foundations. Remittix has sold over 652 million tokens, trades at $0.105, and has raised over $24.6 million. It passed $20 million before listing on BitMart, then cleared $22 million to secure an LBANK listing, with a third exchange in preparation. These moves show momentum beyond speculative narrative. Here are five reasons Remittix stands out: ● Mass market appeal beyond just the crypto crowd● Built for adoption, not speculation● Deflationary tokenomics designed for long-term growth● Global payout rails are already integrated and expanding● Solving a real-world $19T payments problem These strengths position Remittix not just as a meme coin replacement, but as a provider of usable infrastructure and a contender for next wave 100x+ gains. Real Utility May Offer The Clearest Path To Big Returns Shiba Inu Coin and PEPE delivered stunning returns for early believers, but repeating that success now requires a new angle. Remittix offers that angle, with payment first utility, exchange momentum, token health, and user incentives. For investors inspired by meme coin riches, Remittix may be where you can reap the same results, with durability and purpose rather than speculation.

This announcement offers a rare glimpse into how established firms are integrating cryptocurrencies into their financial strategies, signaling a potentially transformative shift in corporate asset management. What Are LineKong’s Crypto Holdings Exactly? LineKong’s recent disclosure has certainly turned heads in the crypto community. The company has revealed a direct holding of 116 Bitcoin (BTC), 663 Ethereum (ETH), and a considerable 7,692 Solana (SOL). This is a clear statement of their confidence in these leading digital assets. Direct Holdings: 116 BTC, 663 ETH, 7,692 SOL Furthermore, when considering the assets held by its various affiliates, the total LineKong crypto holdings become even more impressive, painting a picture of a well-rounded digital asset portfolio. Total Group Holdings (including affiliates): 212 BTC, 2,040 ETH, 10,513 SOL These figures demonstrate a calculated approach to diversifying their treasury, potentially positioning LineKong at the forefront of corporate crypto adoption in Asia. Why Are LineKong Crypto Holdings a Big Deal for the Market? The disclosure of significant LineKong crypto holdings carries considerable weight for several reasons. Firstly, it lends further legitimacy to cryptocurrencies as viable assets for large, publicly traded companies. When a Hong Kong-listed firm makes such a move, it sends a powerful signal to other traditional financial institutions and corporations worldwide. Secondly, this action could inspire a domino effect. As more companies witness the perceived benefits and brave the initial regulatory hurdles, we might see a surge in corporate treasury allocations to digital assets. This trend is crucial for the broader market’s maturity and stability. Moreover, LineKong’s decision reflects a strategic understanding of the evolving digital economy and the potential long-term value of blockchain technology. What’s the Strategy Behind LineKong’s Digital Asset Play? Companies often acquire digital assets for various strategic reasons, and LineKong’s move likely falls into several categories. One primary benefit is diversification. Holding cryptocurrencies can offer an alternative to traditional assets, potentially hedging against inflation or market volatility in other sectors. Another angle is treasury management, where companies seek to optimize their balance sheets with assets that have strong growth potential. Challenges, however, are also part of the equation. Regulatory uncertainty, price volatility, and the complexities of secure storage are significant considerations for any company holding digital assets. LineKong’s decision suggests they have carefully weighed these factors, indicating a robust risk assessment and a clear vision for their LineKong crypto holdings . This bold step also positions them as innovators in their industry, potentially attracting new talent and investors interested in forward-thinking companies. Looking Ahead: The Future of Corporate Crypto Holdings LineKong’s disclosure is more than just an isolated event; it’s a testament to a growing trend. We have seen other companies globally, such as MicroStrategy and Tesla, make similar commitments to Bitcoin. These early adopters are setting precedents and helping to shape the future landscape of corporate finance. As regulatory frameworks become clearer and institutional infrastructure improves, it is plausible that more companies will follow suit, increasing their LineKong crypto holdings or establishing new ones. The actionable insight here for other companies is to begin exploring the potential of digital assets, understanding both the opportunities and the risks. LineKong’s move provides a real-world example of a significant firm navigating this complex but potentially rewarding terrain. Their transparency also contributes to building trust and understanding within the wider financial ecosystem. A Bold Step into the Digital Future LineKong’s disclosure of its substantial LineKong crypto holdings marks a pivotal moment for both the company and the broader cryptocurrency market. By embracing Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, LineKong is not only diversifying its assets but also signaling a strong belief in the digital economy’s future. This strategic move from a Hong Kong-listed giant could inspire further corporate adoption, driving greater legitimacy and stability for digital assets globally. It’s a clear indication that cryptocurrencies are increasingly becoming an integral part of modern corporate strategy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are LineKong crypto holdings? LineKong crypto holdings refer to the cryptocurrencies, specifically Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL), that the Hong Kong-listed company LineKong and its affiliates have disclosed as part of their assets. Q2: Why would a traditional company like LineKong hold cryptocurrencies? Companies hold cryptocurrencies for various strategic reasons, including asset diversification, potential hedging against inflation, treasury management, and embracing new technologies like Web3 to stay competitive and innovative. Q3: Is it common for publicly traded companies to disclose crypto holdings? While still relatively uncommon compared to traditional assets, it is a growing trend. Companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have famously disclosed significant crypto holdings, and LineKong’s announcement further solidifies this emerging practice. Q4: What are the risks associated with corporate crypto holdings? Key risks include high price volatility, evolving regulatory landscapes, security challenges related to digital asset storage, and potential accounting complexities. Companies must conduct thorough due diligence and risk assessment. Q5: How does LineKong’s disclosure impact the crypto market? Such disclosures from established companies can boost market confidence, lend legitimacy to cryptocurrencies, and potentially encourage more institutional and corporate adoption, leading to increased demand and market stability over time. If you found this insight into LineKong’s digital asset strategy compelling, why not share it with your network? Your colleagues and friends interested in crypto and corporate finance will appreciate staying informed about these significant market developments. Spread the word!

But the general market mood is one of consolidation, with the overall market cap stalling at just over $4 trillion. The Cardano price, among others, has some chance of a drop, and that could tell how far ADA falls in the token ranks. Remittix , on the other hand, is pushing for a 30x surge after launch. Here's how both tokens could turn out. Cardano Price: ADA Future Hangs In The Balance The ADA token charts are similar to what the general market feels like. Some analysts read that there's some consolidation on the charts, while others think a big drop is coming. Now, the issue is that the Cardano price is perfectly poised for profits or losses. The token trades at $0.8521, with its resistance at $0.85, and the key support level at $0.72. Cardano came quite close to the support last week, and experts are not ruling out the drop. In fact, the Cardano price could fall even further, to about $0.55 if the bears take over the current cycle, given the token's weakness. And, on top of all that, there's the Remittix token launching right in the heart of DeFi. And everyone is looking forward to it. Remittix Launch: Buy, Hold, Anticipate! The RTX project is offering users direct withdrawal portals from their crypto wallets to any bank account they want. With time, the crypto tokens will become useful for paying all forms of online services and goods. Investors have clocked the potential on Remittix since it announced its presale in January, and many of them bought loads of RTX at the time. The tokens are still selling out, at higher rates, but that's because other crypto stakeholders are choosing Remittix. RTX smart contracts have been audited and approved by Certik, and exchanges like BitMarthave started to list Remittix ahead of launch. And speaking of launch, the Remittix Web3 wallet and 50% of the token supply will be going live later this year. Prepare For Remittix Launch! Buy your RTX tokens at $0.105 each and count down to launch day for your massive returns. Now's your best chance, before the prices spike again!

Investors are balancing dreams of a 15% increase against monitoring fresh DeFi projects that bring more concrete utility. One such project is Remittix (RTX) , already making waves with a presale that has raised more than $24.4 million. Unlike speculation-based plays, the Remittix DeFi platform is developing on the basis ofusability, with a beta wallet available by Q3 2025. This places RTX in the same conversations as established networks, showing just how much early-stage crypto investment can unite legacy finance and digital assets. Solana Price Action and Trading Strength Solana is currently trading at $215.25, 5.7% above the past day. It has a market capital of $116.72 billion after a trading volume of $8.92 billion increased by 199.62%. These figures explain why Solana Price Prediction has served as a point of reference for a number of investors monitoring leading altcoins. But as Solana holds its ground, focus is also being shifted to top-performing crypto under $1 with adoption prospects. That is where RTX enters the picture. By the process of raising capital in its presale as it prepares for exchange listings, it enters the category of budding crypto projects that could match up with Solana's progress rather than go directly against it. Remittix Presale Gains Momentum With Early CEX Listings At $0.1050 per token, Remittix offloaded more than 651 million tokens, showing a huge momentum for investors who want to invest in crypto at an early stage. The presale has already caused two centralized exchange listings. It had its first with BitMart upon crossing the $20 million threshold and the second with LBank upon crossing $22 million. These kinds of listings add liquidity and give RTX better access, advantages not necessarily on the table for low cap crypto gems. With the presale still in progress, these types of measures explain why it's being compared to the top crypto presale 2025 deals. Beta Wallet Launch Nears in Q3 2025 Remittix's plan is centered on the next beta wallet. Set to be released in Q3 2025, the mobile wallet will support more than 40 cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies. It incorporates real-time FX conversion, low-gas-fee crypto transactions, and direct bank account payouts in more than 30 countries. This focus on solving real-world, practical issues puts RTX in a position far beyond just another new crypto token drop. Freelancers, enterprises, and individual consumers obtain a service that simplifies cross-border payments, solidly placing RTX as one of the best DeFi projects 2025. The Breakthroughs Pushing Remittix Forward: ● Over $24.4 million raised in presale● 651 million + tokens sold per $0.1050 each● Confirmed BitMart and LBank listings● Beta wallet launch in Q3 with global distribution● Active $250,000 Remittix Giveaway With a CertiK audit, deflationary tokenomics, and growing exchange support, RTX is becoming a crypto that solves real world problems. Its ability to combine decentralized exchange capabilities with traditional financial rails presents it as an interesting contender among top new altcoin candidates.

Chevron, BP, ConocoPhillips, Aramco, and Petronas have started slashing jobs, cancelling drilling projects, and offloading assets as crude prices keep falling. The cuts started after Brent tumbled from its post-invasion highs and OPEC+ made a weekend decision to ramp up production, ignoring warnings of oversupply. According to the Financial Times, the world’s top oil and gas companies are now moving faster than they did during the 2020 crash. Tens of thousands of workers are being kicked out. Spending is frozen. Some projects have been shelved, others are being dumped entirely to balance the books. Chevron and BP cut jobs as crude prices collapse Chevron and BP have already laid off thousands of workers. At the same time, both companies are racing to find tens of billions more in cost savings. Spending plans are being pulled back. Ongoing projects are either being paused or listed for sale. ConocoPhillips followed them last week, cutting more staff as US shale producers struggle to stay alive under lower prices. The US shale sector is getting hit the hardest. Every high-cost operation is bleeding cash. Brent crude is trading below $66 a barrel, and firms can’t break even, let alone pay dividends and repurchase shares. BP has already scaled back its buybacks. Morgan Stanley said in a note that more oil majors will follow. Even state-run companies aren’t immune. Saudi Aramco just sold a $10 billion stake in its pipeline network to raise cash. Malaysia’s Petronas has slashed 5,000 jobs. Basically, no one is safe, no matter how big they are. Everyone’s trying to stay afloat, not expand. Crude prices have dropped nearly 50% since their peak after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But instead of dialing back, OPEC+ decided to push even more oil into the market. That decision, made over the weekend, will add more pressure to prices. The cartel, which had previously been cutting output to protect prices, has now flipped. For five straight months, they’ve focused on regaining market share, even if that means drowning the US shale sector in cheap barrels. Russia fails quota as OPEC+ increases output Russia missed its August production quota under the OPEC+ agreement. The country pumped 9.175 million barrels per day, which was higher than July but still about 84,000 barrels below its target. The quota included compensation cuts that were agreed earlier to make up for previous overproduction. Russia has a track record of falling behind on these deals. It agreed to reduce supply after going over its limits, but the deadlines and cuts keep changing. Officials say that’s because of seasonal conditions and the geological structure of Russian fields. But regardless of the excuses, the country’s output still isn’t keeping up. Unlike Russia, Saudi Arabia holds over 2 million barrels per day of idle capacity and can boost supply almost instantly. Even after meeting its OPEC+ commitment, it still has plenty of room left. Russia, on the other hand, can’t raise production fast enough to benefit from the extra quota space it was given. OPEC+ promised an increase of 1.66 million barrels per day. But adjusting for compensation cuts and capacity limits, only about 1.15 million will actually show up. That means the group is overselling its actual supply gains. Still, it’s enough to tip the market further into oversupply. The alliance holds more than 3 million barrels per day of spare capacity. Most of that is sitting in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Iraq. They’re the ones who can turn the taps on or off whenever they want. Everyone else, especially Russia, is just trying to catch up. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

According to reports, it will start on November 10, 2025, after regulatory review. The company said it has designed these new futures products to “efficiently deliver continuous long-term market exposure” to BTC and ETH. In addition, the Cboe continuous futures will aim to provide access to perpetual-style futures in a US-regulated, intermediated environment. Catherine Clay, Global Head of Derivatives at Cboe, said, “Perpetual-style futures have gained strong adoption in offshore markets. Now, Cboe is bringing that same utility to our U.S.-regulated futures exchange and enabling U.S. traders to access these products with confidence in a trusted, transparent, and intermediated environment.” This is similar to the CFTC-regulated perpetual futures that the crypto exchange Coinbase launched in July. CBOE to integrate long-dated contracts that last for 10 years Cboe Continuous futures differ from traditional futures contracts since they are meant to be single, long-dated contracts lasting for 10 years. This means you won’t have to roll positions over time as often, simplifying position management. These contracts will be settled in cash and based on real-time spot market values like the spot prices of Bitcoin and Ether, respectively. This will be done by making daily cash adjustments, using a transparent and replicable funding rate technique. The company said that the new Bitcoin and Ether continuous futures will be cleared through Cboe Clear US, which is a CFTC-regulated derivatives clearing organization. This is to position Cboe to further expand its clearing capabilities as it looks to build a robust global derivatives exchange and clearing ecosystem. Catherine Clay said, “We expect Continuous futures to appeal to not only institutional market participants and existing CFE customers, but also to a growing segment of retail traders seeking access to crypto derivatives. As we continue to expand CFE’s offerings to serve all types of market participants, these futures are a next step to advancing our product innovation roadmap.” So far, Cboe has been actively trying to list more exchange-traded funds that track specific digital assets. Recently, in a filing made to the SEC, Cboe BZX asked the agency to change a rule to “permit the generic listing and trading of Commodity-Based Trust Shares that meet the requirements outlined in proposed Rule 14.11(e)(4).” That rule governs the trading and listing of commodity-based trust shares and has specific requirements for certain shares to be listed on the exchange. Meanwhile, Centroid Solutions has completed an integration with Cboe Global Markets that gives the technology provider’s broker clients direct access to real-time market data from the exchange operator. The partnership allows brokers using Centroid’s multi-asset connectivity platform to stream live pricing data for equities, options, indices, and derivatives from both US and European markets directly into their trading systems. Analysts say that Cboe is overvalued Cboe closed at $234.37, running up an impressive 19.3% year-to-date and delivering a 180% return over the past five years. However, its stock dipped 7.2% in the past month and is down 0.7% for the week. According to eight analysts, Cboe has a Book Value of $44.60 per share and is expected to keep its EPS at $11.55 per share. The cost of equity is $4.41 per share, which means that the Excess Return is $7.14 per share. According to two analysts, Cboe’s average Return on Equity is 21.39%. To that end, Cboe Global Markets’ estimated intrinsic value per share is $194.49. The company is presently selling at $234.37.

With ETF approvals driving institutional adoption and legacy projects like Solana, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and XRP eyeing another wave of growth, one new contender is quietly taking center stage. That contender is Little Pepe (LILPEPE) —a presale phenomenon priced at just $0.0021 in Stage 12, already 96% sold out, and having raised over $24.2 million across all stages with more than 15.17 billion tokens sold. While big names dominate headlines, Little Pepe is emerging as a dark horse positioned not just to participate in the coming rally but potentially to outperform the established giants. Here’s why this under-$0.004 token is catching fire at the perfect time. The ETF Approval Effect and Why It Matters Crypto ETFs are no longer hypothetical—they’re here, and they’ve fundamentally altered the investment landscape. Bloomberg analysts estimate a 95% chance of ETF approvals for Solana and Litecoin, and 85% for XRP. These approvals could unlock substantial institutional capital and spur price gains. When ETFs open the doors for mainstream adoption, the rising tide often lifts all boats. Established players like Solana, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and XRP will certainly benefit, but they are already multi-billion-dollar ecosystems. For them, a strong ETF-driven rally might mean double-digit percentage gains. Impressive, yes—but not game-changing. For smaller, emerging tokens like Little Pepe, the situation is radically different. A fresh listing and a modest market cap mean that capital inflows don’t just lift prices—they can multiply them. That’s where the asymmetric opportunity lies. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Presale Juggernaut Little Pepe isn’t just another meme coin chasing the coattails of Dogecoin or Shiba Inu. It’s entering the market with infrastructure in mind. At its core, LILPEPE is building a Layer-2 solution on Ethereum, designed to cater to meme coins and community-driven projects. Its ecosystem promises lightning-fast transactions, anti-sniper-bot mechanics, and its own launchpad, Pepe Pump Pad, that could funnel new meme projects directly into its chain. But it’s the presale dynamics that have lit the fire. With Stage 12 already 96% sold out at $0.0021, the countdown to Stage 13 and eventual exchange listings is accelerating. The presale has already smashed through milestones, $24.2 million raised, 15.17 billion tokens distributed—and momentum is building faster than even the project’s roadmap anticipated. What this tells us is simple: demand is real, and it’s growing. Early backers are positioning themselves for a major launch-day repricing event, and analysts are already projecting multiples ranging from 25× to 50× by the end of Q4, with more aggressive outlooks stretching well beyond. Why Little Pepe Could Outperform in Q4 Timing in crypto is everything, and Little Pepe’s timing looks immaculate. With ETF approvals bringing mainstream credibility to the space, liquidity is flowing back into altcoins and high-beta tokens. Meme culture, once dismissed as a fad, is now an acknowledged growth engine—just look at Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, or Bonk. But unlike many meme projects, Little Pepe is blending cultural firepower with technical infrastructure. When you layer in its tiny entry price, under $0.004 even as it nears presale completion, the runway becomes clear. A rally that pushes Solana 3x, Litecoin 2x, Dogecoin 4x, or XRP 5x might push Little Pepe 25x, 50x, or more, because it’s moving from near-zero to relevance in a market climate primed for speculative upside. Conclusion: The Underdog With Overdrive Potential Solana, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and XRP are all set for solid ETF-driven rallies in Q4. But their upside, while respectable, is inherently capped by size. The asymmetric bet lies with Little Pepe, the under-$0.004 presale rocket that is 96% through Stage 12, backed by over $24.2 million in raised capital and a community hungry for liftoff. If history has taught us anything, it’s that meme-layer projects with real utility can defy expectations and rewrite the leaderboard. In this pivotal quarter, Little Pepe has every ingredient to do exactly that, outperforming not only its meme predecessors but also the giants of the ETF wave. For those willing to act before the presale window slams shut, the opportunity is as clear as it is rare.

Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is making headlines, not just for its low entry price of under $0.004 but for its promising infrastructure that supports meme coins and community-driven projects. With a presale that's nearly sold out and over $24.2 million raised, this token is on the brink of possibly outperforming established crypto giants. Understanding Little Pepe and Its Market Dynamics The crypto market is witnessing a transformation with the introduction of ETFs, which have begun reshaping investment landscapes significantly. Analysts from Bloomberg have highlighted a high probability of ETF approvals for major cryptocurrencies like Solana and Litecoin. Such developments are crucial as they open up avenues for substantial institutional investments, potentially escalating the market values of involved cryptocurrencies. The Promise of Little Pepe: A Presale Success Story Amidst the giants, Little Pepe emerges with distinct characteristics. Unlike typical meme coins, Little Pepe is integrated into a robust infrastructure that supports its operations on Ethereum's Layer-2 solution. This integration is designed to enhance transaction speeds and provide anti-sniper-bot mechanics, which are crucial for the token’s scalability and user protection. The presale statistics are impressive, with Stage 12 nearing completion and a significant amount raised. This indicates a strong market interest and sets the stage for a possibly explosive entry into the market. Potential Market Impact of Little Pepe in Q4 Timing is crucial in the cryptocurrency industry, and Little Pepe's timing could not be better. With the ETF approvals on the horizon, there is renewed interest in altcoins and high-beta tokens. Little Pepe's unique positioning in meme culture, coupled with its technical backbone, sets it apart from many other projects that lack substantial infrastructure. The anticipated market entry price of under $0.004 gives Little Pepe significant room for growth, potentially allowing it to outperform the rallies expected for bigger cryptocurrencies like Solana or Litecoin. Conclusion While established tokens like Solana, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and XRP are preparing for growth stimulated by ETF approvals, Little Pepe could surprise the market with its performance. Being at the cusp of its final presale stage, it might offer an asymmetric investment opportunity, especially in a market that's ripe for speculative investments.

USD RobinHood wird Teil des S&P 500 und seine Aktie steigt deutlich. Beide Fälle zeigen, wie sehr Krypto-Unternehmen inzwischen die Finanzmärkte beeinflussen. In der Finanzwelt ist gerade viel Bewegung. Robinhood, bekannt für seine Handels-App, wurde in den wichtigen Aktienindex S&P 500 aufgenommen. Gleichzeitig setzt das Unternehmen Strategy, das auf Bitcoin spezialisiert ist, auf einen riesigen Nachkauf der Kryptowährung. Diese beiden Entwicklungen zeigen, wie groß die Rolle von digitalen Vermögenswerten inzwischen geworden ist. Robinhood wird in den S&P 500 aufgenommen Robinhood, die bekannte Handels-App für Kleinanleger, hat einen großen Schritt geschafft: Das Unternehmen wird am 22. September in den Aktienindex S&P 500 aufgenommen. Dieser Index listet die 500 größten börsennotierten Unternehmen in den USA und gilt als wichtiges Barometer für die Wirtschaft. Die Nachricht löste sofort Freude bei Anlegern aus. Nach Börsenschluss legte die Aktie um sieben Prozent zu und erreichte mehr als 108 US-Dollar. Seit Jahresbeginn ist der Kurs sogar schon um über 150 Prozent gestiegen. Die Aufnahme in den Index zeigt, wie stark Robinhood inzwischen geworden ist. Besonders wichtig ist dabei, dass sich das Unternehmen stark auf den Handel mit digitalen Vermögenswerten, also Kryptowährungen , konzentriert. In den letzten Monaten sind die politischen und rechtlichen Bedingungen für diese Branche freundlicher geworden, was Firmen wie Robinhood in die Karten spielt. Starke Geschäftszahlen sichern den Erfolg Dass Robinhood nun in den S&P 500 aufgenommen wird, liegt auch an den guten Geschäftszahlen. Im zweiten Quartal 2025 erzielte das Unternehmen einen Umsatz von 989 Millionen US-Dollar. Das war 45 Prozent mehr als im Jahr zuvor und deutlich über den Erwartungen der Experten, die nur mit 913 Millionen gerechnet hatten. Auch beim Gewinn schnitt Robinhood sehr gut ab. Pro Aktie lag der Gewinn bei 0,42 US-Dollar. Insgesamt verdiente die Firma 386 Millionen US-Dollar, 50 Millionen mehr als im Vorjahr. Damit übertraf Robinhood auch hier die Prognosen der Analysten, die nur 276 Millionen erwartet hatten. Strategy wird nicht aufgenommen Während Robinhood den Aufstieg feiert, musste das Unternehmen Strategy einen Rückschlag hinnehmen. Strategy, früher unter dem Namen MicroStrategy bekannt, hatte sich ebenfalls Hoffnungen auf die Aufnahme in den S&P 500 gemacht. Mit einer Marktkapitalisierung von 95 Milliarden US-Dollar hätte es die formalen Voraussetzungen erfüllt. Doch die Verantwortlichen entschieden anders und nahmen Strategy nicht auf. Das sorgte für Enttäuschung bei vielen Anlegern. Die Aktie fiel im nachbörslichen Handel um fast drei Prozent. Strategy ist bekannt dafür, riesige Mengen an BTC zu halten und gilt als Vorreiter in diesem Bereich. Strategy kauft fast 2.000 neue Bitcoin Strategy reagierte auf die Absage mit einer klaren Botschaft. Nur wenige Tage später gab das Unternehmen bekannt, dass es 1.955 neue Bitcoin gekauft hat. Dafür wurden 217 Millionen US-Dollar ausgegeben, bei einem Durchschnittspreis von rund 111.000 US-Dollar pro Coin. Strategy has acquired 1,955 BTC for ~$217.4 million at ~$111,196 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 25.8% YTD 2025. As of 9/7/2025, we hodl 638,460 $BTC acquired for ~$47.17 billion at ~$73,880 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRC $STRK $STRF $STRD https://t.co/QNIuAWRwEW — Michael Saylor (@saylor) September 8, 2025 Damit hält Strategy nun insgesamt 638.460 Bitcoin. Diese haben bei aktuellen Kursen einen Wert von mehr als 71 Milliarden US-Dollar. Für die Aktionäre bedeutet das eine Rendite von fast 26 Prozent seit Jahresbeginn. Strategy machte den Kauf möglich, indem es neue Aktien und Vorzugsaktien verkaufte und damit über 217 Millionen US-Dollar einnahm. Bitcoin-Käufe weltweit nehmen zu Strategy ist mit diesem Vorgehen nicht allein. Auch andere Firmen und sogar Staaten kaufen weiter Bitcoin. In Japan hat das Unternehmen Metaplanet 136 neue BTC für rund 15 Millionen US-Dollar erworben. Damit besitzt es nun mehr als 20.000 Coins. Auch El Salvador bleibt seinem Kurs treu. Zum vierten Jahrestag, seit BTC dort offizielles Zahlungsmittel ist, kaufte die Regierung 21 weitere Coins. Solche Käufe zeigen, dass das Interesse an Bitcoin weltweit nicht nachlässt und sogar zunimmt. Bitcoin bleibt stabil trotz gemischter Nachrichten Trotz der Enttäuschung über die Nichtaufnahme von Strategy in den Index blieb der Bitcoin-Kurs stabil. Er lag zuletzt bei etwa 112.000 US-Dollar und stieg sogar leicht um 0,9 Prozent in den vergangenen 24 Stunden. Analysten sehen darin ein Zeichen für die Stärke und Beständigkeit der Kryptowährung. Lies hier unsere Prognosen für Altcoins mit Potential im September Experten betonen, dass Unternehmen wie Strategy eine feste Nachfragebasis schaffen. Indem sie immer wieder große Mengen kaufen, sorgen sie für Stabilität. Für Anleger ist das ein Hinweis darauf, dass Bitcoin längst mehr ist als ein spekulatives Produkt – er wird zunehmend Teil des globalen Finanzsystems. Ob Bitcoin auch Teil des globalen Finanzsystems wird ist Spekulation – aber ein interessantes Projekt mit echt nützlichen Background ist es auf jeden Fall. Nicht ohne Grund ist Bitcoin Hyper in den letzten Wochen im Presale richtig durchgestartet. Wenn Bitcoin auf Solana trifft – und plötzlich Beine macht Bitcoin ist groß, stark und sicher – quasi der Bodybuilder unter den Blockchains. Aber so wie ein Muskelprotz, der beim Sprinten ins Schnaufen kommt, hat auch BTC seine Schwächen: langsam, teuer und nicht gerade flexibel. Jetzt stell dir vor, dieser Koloss bekommt die Sprinter-Schuhe von Solana angezogen. Genau das macht Bitcoin Hyper: Es verheiratet die unerschütterliche Sicherheit von BTC mit der Turbo-Geschwindigkeit von Solana. Plötzlich wird aus „digitalem Gold“ ein Werkzeugkasten für alles – von DeFi über Gaming bis hin zu Apps, die in Echtzeit laufen. Kurz gesagt: BTC bleibt BTC, aber in schnell, günstig und richtig smart. $HYPER – der Schlüssel zum Turbo-Bitcoin Damit das Ganze nicht nur eine nette Idee bleibt, braucht’s natürlich Treibstoff – und das ist der $HYPER-Token. Er sorgt dafür, dass man im Hyper-Universum nicht nur zusehen, sondern richtig mitmischen kann. Mit $HYPER bezahlst du Transaktionen, sicherst dir Staking-Rewards und darfst bei wichtigen Entscheidungen mitreden. Das Beste: Jeder Bitcoin bleibt über eine dezentrale Brücke bombensicher, während er gleichzeitig in der Hyper-Welt Gas gibt. Wer jetzt einsteigt, bekommt den Coin zum Einstiegspreis – ohne Insider-Deals, dafür mit ehrlichem Zugang. Oder anders gesagt: eine Gelegenheit, bei der Bitcoin nicht nur glänzt, sondern endlich auch sprintet. Jetzt rechtzeitig einsteigen und $HYPER im Presale kaufen.",Deutsch,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|SOL|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-09 17:59:24

Hours later, Donald Trump’s administration and the European Union locked arms again to hit back. Officials allegedly told CNBC that the 19th round of sanctions is on the way. The war’s been dragging on for over three years, and instead of slowing down, it’s clearly heating up. One EU official, reportedly speaking anonymously because nothing’s been finalized yet, said the new measures will be “presented at the end of the week or early next week.” All 27 EU countries still have to sign off before anything takes effect. But the pressure is building fast. EU and U.S. diplomats met in Washington DC over the weekend to iron out details, with energy, again, the main target. EU pushes to kill Russia’s oil ties faster A second EU official told CNBC, “It is clear that energy dependency on Russia will be targeted more vehemently.” Talks are zooming in on the Druzhba pipeline, which delivers Russian oil directly to Hungary and Slovakia, two countries still holding tight ties to Moscow. This new package is expected to list more ships from Russia’s shadow fleet, those sneaky vessels used to dodge shipping rules. It will also slap restrictions on Russian diplomats and tourists, tightening their ability to move through Europe. Europe is also looking beyond Russia this time. Officials are floating secondary sanctions, which means targeting China, a major buyer of Russian oil and gas. “This is the big question,” said the first EU official, adding that the bloc hasn’t decided yet if it will actually go there. But the discussion’s on the table. China’s banks have already been hit in earlier rounds for helping Russia get around sanctions. Now more may be coming. Meanwhile, Trump’s team is urging Europe to speed up its timeline. Right now, the EU plans to stop buying Russian oil by 2028. But Washington’s pushing harder. “The U.S. is focused on pushing us to phase out Russian oil and gas faster than the current deadline,” the first EU official said. And money is already changing hands. Under a recent trade deal, the EU agreed to purchase $750 billion worth of U.S. energy, a major change meant to replace what used to come from Russia, Cryptopolitan reported .

BetMGM just dropped a slick new app and signed a sponsorship with the Detroit Lions, while Caesars is firing up NFL Week 1 with profit-boost promos and even offering a $300 Vegas package. They’re moving fast, but players still hit delays when it comes to cashing out. That’s where Spartans shows its edge. Unlike the so-called top online casino names that make you pick between fiat or crypto, Spartans lets you roll with both. With instant withdrawals, BTC, ETH, USDT, AVAX, and fiat access in select regions, Spartans isn’t about compromise, it’s built to win. Spartans: Fast Payouts, Any Currency Spartans is built around one simple promise: you get paid fast. Most casinos force players to pick between slow fiat withdrawals or the risks of pure crypto. Spartans flips that script. Whether you use BTC, ETH, USDT, AVAX, or even fiat in supported regions, you get instant access to your winnings without ID bottlenecks or unnecessary waiting. That’s the real edge, speed without compromise. As a top online casino, Spartans combines a full sportsbook and casino under one login. Players can dive into over 5,963 games, from high-volatility slots and crash games to live blackjack and roulette, plus betting across football, cricket, NBA, and UFC. Add instant deposits and cashouts, and you’ve got a platform that feels built for serious players, not just casual pass-throughs. The project isn’t just about gaming, though. Spartans has launched a presale that’s already turning heads, offering investors a chance to grab tokens tied to a casino and sportsbook with real traction. With huge features like affiliate revenue share models, integrated promotions, and headline-grabbing giveaways like the Lamborghini Challenge, Spartans is positioning its presale as both a utility and hype driver. What really sets it apart is that it doesn’t make you pick sides in the fiat vs. crypto debate. You can trust the security of traditional currencies while still tapping into the global liquidity of crypto, and cash out instantly either way. That’s why Spartans is being talked about as a top online casino that’s engineered for the future, not stuck in the past. BetMGM NFL Kickoff Push BetMGM is starting September with a fresh app redesign and a heavy promo push tied to the NFL and MLB. The new look comes with smoother navigation and a better user experience, backed by aggressive offers for new players. Codes like POSTBET give up to $1,500 in bonus bets for the Yankees vs. Astros matchup, while CBSSPORTS and NW150 unlock $150 in bonus bets or refunds up to $1,500 on NFL Week 1 games. On top of that, BetMGM is now the official betting partner of the Detroit Lions, putting its brand right in front of fans all season. It’s clear the platform is going all-in to secure users at the start of football season. By stacking promotions across both MLB and NFL, BetMGM is positioning itself as a go-to option for bettors who want value from day one. With its team partnership and revamped app, the sportsbook is showing that this season is about more than just odds, it’s about delivering consistent engagement. Caesars NFL Season Kickoff Caesars is leaning into NFL Week 1 with a stack of promotions designed to pull in new bettors. Codes like CBS20X, SBD20X, and ACTION420X unlock 20 profit boosts, starting with just a $1 qualifying bet and a $10 deposit. Beyond promos, Caesars has upgraded its sportsbook with features like NFL Flips, NFL Jackpot, and Live Quick Pick Parlays, all aimed at making betting faster and more engaging. The app has also been refined with smoother navigation, cash-out options, and a universal wallet for a more streamlined experience. Away from betting, Caesars is adding value on multiple fronts. A $300 Vegas package now includes a two-night stay plus $200 in food and beverage credit, appealing to budget-conscious travelers. In Canada, Caesars partnered with Evoplay to boost its digital gaming lineup in Ontario, and in the U.S., a lucky sweepstakes winner just walked away with $1 million. With promotions, partnerships, and hospitality offers, Caesars is going broad to stay competitive this season. Summing Up BetMGM kicked off September with a new app design, bold promos, and a Detroit Lions partnership, proving it wants to own the NFL season. Caesars fired back with profit-boost codes, product upgrades, and even a $300 Vegas package, showing its reach across betting and hospitality. Both are stepping up their game, but neither solves the biggest issue bettors care about: fast, hassle-free payouts. That’s where Spartans takes the lead. Unlike other names that make you choose between slow fiat or risky crypto, Spartans offers both with instant withdrawals, no ID delays, and support for BTC, ETH, USDT, AVAX, and fiat in select regions. This is what makes Spartans more than just another top online casino, it’s a platform designed to win in both worlds, giving players the speed and freedom they actually want.

Nonetheless, beneath the short-term swings, a major technical shift is quietly unfolding in the altcoin market. According to analysis by crypto analyst CrypFlow, the total market capitalization of altcoins (excluding Bitcoin) has just completed its highest monthly close on record. This close could change the conversation around whether a new alt season is about to begin. Breakout Beyond Previous Cycle Tops Although August ended with many cryptocurrencies closing below their highs for that month, analysis of the altcoin market cap shows that the altcoin market managed to register its highest monthly close ever. Interestingly, crypto analyst CrypFlow pointed to the long-term monthly chart of the altcoin market, which shows how the current rally is building on historical cycle patterns. After the cycle top in 2018 and another in 2021, followed by the 2022 bottom, the chart now shows a close above a breakout line. The breakout line on the chart is the culmination of an upward trend that has been forming since the 2022 cycle bottom, which is connected by a series of higher lows. The most recent monthly close is also a breakout above the cycle top in 2021, and the altcoin market now has a total valuation of around $1.6 trillion. This highest monthly close, alongside some bullish divergence indicators, shows that the altcoin market cap may be preparing for a strong rally just like after it closed above the 2018 cycle top back in 2020. One of the most notable confirmations comes from the MACD, which has just crossed into bullish territory on the monthly timeframe. As noted by CrypFlow, this kind of signal is rare and often precedes large upside moves. Interestingly, the RSI, too, is just above the midpoint, meaning the altcoin market cap still has a long way to go before being oversold. What This Means For Alt Season As it stands, the altcoin market is about to enter into a bullish period that could determine the rest of the year. Past cycles have shown that many altcoins typically deliver their strongest performances between October and December. As shown in the chart above, the altcoin market cap also closed above its 2018 in late 2020. If this late-year trend repeats itself, the current breakout could be the trigger for one of the most decisive altcoin rallies yet. Going by the previous performance in 2020 and 2021, the altcoin market could register multiple bullish candles in the months left in 2025 and the first few months of 2026.

The company notified state regulators that it wants the green light for passenger pick-ups and drop-offs at all three locations, according to internal records allegedly seen by Politico. Casey Blaine, Tesla’s senior regulatory lawyer, wrote that they’re “initiating engagement with the following airports to secure the necessary approvals.” Tesla requests permits while skipping full AV rules Elon has been hyping the Robotaxi vision for years. His idea? Millions of Teslas driving themselves, picking people up without a driver. That’s also part of a huge pay package the board just proposed for him. One route to becoming the world’s first trillionaire runs through one million robotaxis. But here’s the thing: Tesla hasn’t followed the state’s full process for autonomous vehicles. Instead, it launched in July with a limited type of permit meant for charter-party carriers, not full self-driving services. Doug Yakel from SFO confirmed: “We have received a request from Tesla expressing interest in securing a permit for operations at SFO, and have responded back to begin scheduling discussions on this.” Julie Jarratt from San Jose airport added, “Tesla had also inquired about obtaining a permit to operate the [transportation charter party] ride-hailing service,” but so far, no permit has been issued and no application submitted. Oakland Airport’s Kaley Skantz said, “Our team has been in contact with Tesla’s Public Policy and Business Development team, but we have not yet met with them.” In short: a lot of conversations, but no signed deals. Meanwhile, Waymo (Google’s robotaxi company) has already locked in approvals. Last Thursday, San Jose airport became the first in California (and only the second in the country) to allow Waymo to operate. The company also reached a deal to start mapping the San Francisco airport after a long fight with the Teamsters Union. That leaves the question: Can Elon even call this thing a robotaxi? Scott Moura from UC Berkeley’s transportation institute doesn’t think so. “The current Tesla cars have assistive features that need the driver to stay alert and are not regulated in California as fully autonomous,” he told Politico. “The company is trying to gather volumes of data… from sales of privately owned vehicles and this Uber-like Robotaxi fleet.” Officials press Tesla over Robotaxi label and unclear terms Even though the app is called “Robotaxi”, neither Elon nor the company used the word in promotional materials when launching it in Austin in June or in the Bay Area in July. When the app went public last Wednesday, all three major airports showed up as “blocked.” Last Thursday, officials from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) visited Tesla’s Palo Alto office to ask questions and see the service firsthand. The visit had been planned for weeks. Ashlyn Kong from CPUC and her team rode in the vehicles and met Tesla’s team. “CPUC staff are aware of Tesla’s recently expanded Bay Area charter-party carrier service and associated app,” said Terrie Prosper from the agency. “We expect Tesla and all carriers to properly and clearly represent their service.” The company also told CPUC earlier this year that it knew more permits would be needed for real autonomous service. Elon posted last month on X, saying Tesla isn’t allowed to use the word “taxi” under California law, but also said they’re “working as quickly as possible to get 100+ Teslas operating for autonomous ride-hailing” in the Bay Area. Each airport has a different process. Jarratt said that San Jose’s category “would depend on the initial offerings.” She confirmed that Tesla has multiple active business licenses in the city. But beyond that, autonomous vehicle companies have to follow strict reporting and operating rules. Waymo’s launch will come in steps, starting with staff-only rides, then a public rollout later in the year. Tasha Dean from San Jose’s city office said there’s been no conversation with Elon’s team about autonomous rides. Get seen where it counts.

Hoskinson also explained how he entered the crypto space and why he left Ethereum. Hoskinson stated that his intellectual curiosity began in childhood, and the Ron Paul campaign in 2007 sparked his interest in the idea of “sound money.” Although he discovered Bitcoin around 2010, he said he initially didn't take the project seriously. However, events like the 2013 launch of Silk Road, the network's survival even after its founder left, and the financial crisis in Southern Cyprus convinced Hoskinson of Bitcoin's potential and made him a “professional Bitcoiner.” Hoskinson, one of Ethereum's eight founders, confirmed his early departure from the project and advised young entrepreneurs to avoid launching with too many founders and to establish a clear founder agreement. Related News: Chinese Giant Ant Group Makes $8 Billion Move in Cryptocurrency Sector Hoskinson argued that the Ethereum vision has truly come to life in Cardano, citing Cardano's unique design features, such as Extended UTXO, liquid non-custodial staking, and on-chain governance. He also suggested that Ethereum has become a victim of its own success and may not exist in 10-15 years. He based this view on Ethereum's reliance on Layer 2s and structural challenges that Bitcoin DeFi's growing momentum cannot overcome. Hoskinson pointed out the large number of founders at Ethereum, which has eight co-founders, and the lack of a clear agreement between them. He believed this posed a problem for the project's future. *This is not investment advice.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-who-called-recent-xrp-bottom-and-breakout-says-youre-not-bullish-enough-heres-why/,"XRP has broken out of weeks of sideways pressure, and one analyst is reminding traders that the move should not be taken lightly. Market watcher Xoom, who flagged XRP’s late-August bottom and pinpointed the recent breakout, says investors are still underestimating the scale of what could come next. From Bottom Call to Breakout Xoom recently told followers the bottom was “almost in” and warned not to be surprised when the market reversed. Just days later, on September 6, he highlighted a tightening triangle structure on XRP’s daily chart, arguing that the market “will NOT keep moving sideways.” True to form, XRP snapped higher earlier today, climbing above $3 and breaking through the descending resistance line that had capped price action for weeks. That accuracy has given weight to his latest message: this is not a time for caution, but conviction. XRP- called the bottom, called the breakout. You're not bullish enough. pic.twitter.com/f3QglFe33q — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) September 9, 2025 Technicals Confirm the Shift The setup was classic. XRP defended its $2.70–$2.80 support zone in late August, forming a solid base while a descending trendline compressed price action from above. Such triangles rarely drift endlessly—liquidity builds, and a breakout becomes inevitable. When XRP cleared $3 , the pattern resolved decisively to the upside. Traders now view the July peak of around $3.65 as the next key resistance level , with the $3 breakout area acting as a significant turning point. Why Traders Aren’t Bullish Enough For Xoom, the danger is not missing the call, but failing to react. His warnings repeatedly highlighted market psychology: traders frequently expect sideways trends to continue, even when the charts indicate a potential shift. By the time conviction builds, much of the move is already gone. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 “The whole market will NOT keep moving sideways,” he posted earlier this month, stressing that compression phases historically end with sharp moves, not quiet fades. That dynamic, he argues, is already in play—and yet the market remains too cautious. Market Implications With price action now confirming his thesis, Xoom’s view is clear: underestimating XRP could mean missing a larger rally leg. The $2.70 floor remains the key downside marker, while $3.65 looms as the next upside objective. Sustained closes above $3 will determine whether momentum carries forward. Beyond technicals, XRP’s breakout comes as sentiment across digital assets shows early signs of rotation back into high-liquidity majors. That backdrop makes the timing of the move all the more significant. Bottom Line Xoom called the bottom. He called the breakout. And now, he insists the crowd is still behind the curve . For traders, the question is no longer whether XRP has broken out, but whether they are positioned for what could follow.

As reported by Forbes on Tuesday, the decision has led to a 7% decline in the WLFI price, causing it to fall below the crucial $0.20 threshold. Confusion Surrounds Eric Trump’s Exit From ALT5 Sigma The announcement of Trump’s departure was made through a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, which revealed that the change came just weeks after ALT5 Sigma had initially appointed him as a director. Related Reading: This Week In Crypto: What Investors Need To Know And Why It Matters According to the report, the decision to remove Trump was made in consultation with The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC to ensure compliance with its listing rules. However, the specific regulations that prompted this action were not disclosed in the filing. Interestingly, three securities law professors consulted by Forbes were unable to identify a clear reason why Nasdaq would accept one appointee from the company while rejecting another. Nasdaq requires that a majority of board members at listed companies be independent, and if Eric Trump did not meet these criteria, it raises further questions about why Zachary Folkman, his replacement, would qualify. WLFI Price Sinks To $0.19 Just weeks prior, Eric Trump, alongside his brother Donald Trump Jr. and executives from World Liberty Financial, participated in a ceremonial ringing of the Nasdaq opening bell. This event coincided with ALT5 Sigma’s announcement of a significant fundraising effort, aiming to raise $1.5 billion through private share sales to acquire WLFI tokens, the native cryptocurrency issued by World Liberty Financial. Despite the formal announcement made to the SEC, it is noteworthy that ALT5 Sigma’s website still lists Eric Trump as a board director on its leadership and investor relations pages. Related Reading: Solana Power Play: Galaxy, Jump Crypto, Multicoin Behind New $1.6 Billion Treasury Strategy Following the filing, the WLFI price dropped to $0.1961, further exacerbating its negative performance over the last 24 hours and seven days, with a 14% decline over the latter period. According to CoinGecko data, the WLFI price is currently trading 39% below its all-time high (ATH) of $0.33, which was reached on September 1st—the day the token debuted on major exchanges after months of anticipation.
