55318055,639252,1764802853,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55318055.jpeg,Crypto Gains Strong Legal Protection in the UK as Lawmakers Finalize Digital Asset Property Rules,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-gains-strong-legal-protection-in-the-uk-as/,"The UK has reached a defining moment for its digital economy, introducing legal clarity that crypto users and businesses have long sought. For a long time, cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and other digital tokens existed in a grey legal zone, recognised by courts in practice but not formally defined in statute. That uncertainty shaped how disputes were settled, how assets were recovered, and how companies approached innovation. Now, with Parliament passing the Property (Digital Assets, etc.) Act and securing royal assent, the UK has made a deliberate shift toward a more structured digital asset framework. The new rules are designed to do more than refine legal language. It is believed that they will help how English law categorises emerging technologies, laying the groundwork for clearer ownership rights, smoother dispute resolution, and broader institutional participation. UK Issues Digital Assets Firm Legal Ownership Status The legislation confirms that digital or electronic “things” qualify as personal property, placing cryptocurrencies on the same legal footing as traditional assets. Previously, courts treated crypto as property through case-by-case rulings, relying on common law. Parliament’s decision now writes this position into statute, following a 2024 recommendation from the Law Commission. Digital assets had long challenged existing classifications. UK law traditionally recognised two forms of personal property: physical items (“things in possession”) and enforceable rights (“things in action”). Crypto fits neither category neatly. The new law resolves this by creating space for a distinct type of property that reflects how digital tokens behave and are used in modern markets. Industry groups welcomed the change, stating that it will help courts deal with theft, fraud, insolvency, and inheritance cases involving crypto with greater consistency. Users now have a clearer pathway for proving ownership and recovering lost or stolen digital funds. Stronger Protections as Adoption Rises The shift arrives as crypto participation continues to grow in the UK. According to financial regulators , around 12% of adults now hold some form of crypto, up from 10% in earlier findings. Policymakers have argued that this rising adoption makes legal certainty essential for both consumer protection and market stability. The new statute also aligns with the government’s broader plan for a regulated crypto regime that would bring exchanges and service providers under rules similar to those applied to traditional financial firms. Lawmakers aim to support innovation while introducing clear standards for accountability.

The former Ministry of Internal Affairs employee is believed to have accepted bribes worth $30 million and used them to buy various luxury assets. Russian prosecutors are seeking to seize property worth over 2.1 billion rubles from former Ministry of Internal Affairs official Georgy Satyukov, who allegedly accepted $184 million in Bitcoin and $30 million in Ethereum in bribes. How did a Russian police official become a millionaire? A former Ministry of Internal Affairs employee named Georgy Satyukov was identified by Russian prosecutors as the owner of various luxury assets, which Russian authorities believe were purchased with bribes from the operators of WEX crypto exchange. These luxury assets include 13 apartments in Russia, several commercial properties in St. Petersburg, and a villa in the UAE. Satyukov’s property holdings also include a $1 million property in the Russian city of Saratov registered in his brother’s name. Beyond real estate, investigators discovered two Porsche Cayenne Turbo cars registered in Satyukov’s name, all purchased after 2021, along with seven Patek Philippe watches, an ST Dupont Paris watch, and other jewelry valued at over $1.3 million. A search of Satyukov’s bank account revealed cash reserves of $540,000, as well as $38,500 in euros, and $14.2 million in Russian rubles held by him and his immediate family members. Satyukov began working at the ministry in 2001 and, between 2019 and 2021, headed a top-secret department codenamed “K” that specialized in investigating financial fraud cases and cybercrime. During his entire time as a Ministry of Internal Affairs employee, Satyukov’s salary would have added up to just $126,165. The Prosecutor General’s Office has filed a lawsuit demanding that movable and immovable property belonging to Satyukov, his relatives, and Dmitry Sokolov, Satyukov’s colleague at the Ministry of Internal Affairs, who is considered an intermediary in the bribery scheme, be transferred to state income. What was the WEX Exchange? Before its collapse, the WEX exchange was a popular platform that emerged in September 2017 as a successor to BTC-e. BTC-e was founded in July 2011 by Alexander Vinnik and Aleksandr Bilyuchenko, and as of February 2015, it handled around 3% of all Bitcoin exchange volume. However, the U.S. Justice Department shut the exchange down in July 2017 when it charged Vinnik with operating an alleged international money laundering scheme. The exchange was accused of facilitating criminal activities because it had no anti-money laundering or know-your-customer processes and collected virtually no customer data. WEX promised to compensate former BTC-e users for their losses, but in the summer of 2018, WEX clients’ wallets were suddenly frozen, and funds could only be removed at a 90% loss. Approximately $450 million in cryptocurrency vanished from the exchange. It was Alexey Ivanov, who pleaded guilty to embezzling 3.17 billion rubles from the cryptocurrency exchange, who pointed authorities to Satyukov after concluding a pre-trial cooperation agreement with the Prosecutor General’s Office. In exchange for his cooperation, Ivanov was released from criminal liability for paying bribes but received a three-year and six-month sentence for embezzling funds from the exchange’s clients. Satyukov was arrested in absentia and placed on an international wanted list. His alleged accomplice, Sokolov reportedly died in Mexico in July 2024, according to legal representatives. Both men are believed to have fled Russia to avoid prosecution. If convicted in the trial scheduled to begin December 8, their seized assets could be transferred to the Russian Treasury.

This favors a bullish XRP price prediction as institutional appetite seems to be rising. According to SoSo Value, the assets under management (AUM) held in these funds have surged to $844 million in just a couple of weeks, following the launch of multiple ETFs by Bitwise, Canary Capital, and Grayscale. On December 1, these vehicles attracted $89 million even though the market was experiencing a strong decline. In the past 24 hours, XRP has surged by 7% to $2.17 as the crypto market seems ready to make a comeback. Trading volumes have increased by 20% to nearly $5 billion, currently accounting for 4% of the token’s circulating market cap. XRP Price Prediction: 48% Gain Ahead If XRP Reverses Its Downtrend The daily chart shows that XRP is about to hit the upper bound of a descending price channel that has been forming since early October. If the price breaks out of this setup and climbs above its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), this would justify a bullish XRP price prediction. Source: TradingView The first target if that happens would be the $3.1 level, meaning a 48% upside potential based on where the price is trading today. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been forming a bullish divergence, as momentum has not made a lower low, even though the price has kept dropping. If positive ETF inflows continue, or accelerate, over the next few days, that should create a strong floor for XRP, and could result in an explosive move if bears are squeezed out of their positions. Meanwhile, as the market recovers, the best crypto presales of this year, like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , could outperform well-established tokens like XRP. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Will Pave the Way for a New Era of Bitcoin Applications BTC holders and developers have been restrained by the network’s slow speed and high transaction costs for years. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to change that by introducing the first real layer-2 chain for the top crypto using Solana’s technology. Through the Hyper Bridge, investors will be able to maintain their assets in a designated Bitcoin wallet and receive the corresponding amount on the Hyper L2 to access a suite of DeFi applications, payment platforms, and even launchpads for meme coins. Through these solutions, they will get the chance to stake their assets, earn yield, and more to generate passive income safely for the first time, all without leaving the Bitcoin OG blockchain. Analysts believe that as wallets and exchanges adopt Bitcoin Hyper, the demand for its native asset, $HYPER, is expected to increase rapidly. To buy $HYPER while it is still available at its presale price, simply head to the official Bitcoin Hyper website and link up a compatible wallet like Best Wallet .

This development could weigh heavily on Shiba Inu price prediction sentiment, as it highlights a critical weakness in the ecosystem’s infrastructure. The update came from developer Mitsuki Ryu Shimamoto, part of the K9 Finance team, who disclosed the details following a key breakthrough in the investigation.

Despite his efforts, analyst Shimamoto acknowledged it is unlikely that the hacker will “face justice”. Tracing the money will demand a significant effort from authorities, along with manpower and resources, that they may not be willing to invest. The whole incident revealed technical flaws in the design of an important piece of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Although prices are starting to show signs of recovery. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Positive Momentum Accelerates as SHIB Tags Key Trend Line Resistance SHIB has jumped 11% in the past 24 hours, signaling that momentum may finally be shifting in its favor. After Monday’s sharp dip, the broader market appears poised for a comeback, with SHIB leading the charge among top meme coins. While the token remains 58% down year-to-date, it is now approaching a key breakout point around $0.0000090. A decisive move above this level could open the door to a retest of $0.000010 and potentially set the stage for a full trend reversal. If this bullish setup plays out, SHIB could reclaim market attention as traders begin rotating back into high-upside assets. Meanwhile, new meme coins are stealing the spotlight this cycle. One of the most talked-about presales is Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , which has already raised over $4 million as early buyers rush in ahead of what could be a breakout debut. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Injects Meme Energy Into the Trading World Through a Fun Token Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is an Ethereum meme coin that embodies the hype that comes with bull markets. Its goal is to build a thriving community of like-minded ‘degens’ who know that their only way out of mom’s basement is through YOLO trades.

Traders will receive rewards and bragging rights for climbing the leaderboard by showcasing their ROIs. In addition, up to 25% of the presale’s proceeds will be used to invest in promising tokens with 1000X leverage, because YOLO. The gains will be used to pay for marketing campaigns that turn Maxi into a widely known meme coin.

Bitcoin has posted a 7% gain in the past 24 hours, with Ethereum up by 9%, Solana up by 12%, and Sui up by 26%. Sentiment is turning more positive after a bearish couple of months, with investors becoming increasingly optimistic that the Fed will cut rates when it meets next week. This has provided the optimal conditions for a big rally in December and January, and it won’t only be major tokens that will see significant returns. Newer coins could also outperform, which is why this article takes a closer look at upcoming ERC-20 crypto PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , our pick for the next altcoin to turn $100 into $10,000. Next Altcoin to Turn $100 into $10,000 – 3 December PEPENODE isn’t simply another Pepe-themed meme coin, but rather a utility token for an innovative mining platform. It removes the barriers that usually keep ordinary cryptocurrency investors from engaging in more traditional mining (e.g., Bitcoin mining), getting rid of the need to buy and operate expensive mining hardware. Whatever it takes to get the Node Upgrade. https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/oxKHfS1QBY — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) December 1, 2025 Instead, PEPENODE enables users to build, update, and run their own virtual mining rigs, which they can grow by spending PEPENODE tokens on new nodes. By buying more nodes and by upgrading and combining them in novel ways, users can earn more mining rewards. PEPENODE will pay out these rewards in external tokens, including Fartcoin and Pepe, with other popular coins coming after launch. This ability to earn via a virtual rig should invite considerable demand for PEPENODE, boosting its price considerably. Investors will also be able to earn by selling on their nodes when they no longer need them, and by staking PEPENODE, which currently provides a yield of 576% APY . These features could make PEPENODE a very profitable token to hold, especially if the market does enter a bull phase around its launch. PEPENODE Presale Raises $2.25 Million: How to Buy Early In order to buy PEPENODE early, before it lists and potentially surges, investors can go to the coin’s official website . They can connect a compatible wallet (such as Best Wallet) and then purchase whatever amount of the coin they would like, using ETH, USDT, BNB, or fiat to pay. The token is currently selling at $0.0011778, a price which will continue to rise until the presale comes to its end. Given its tokenomics and fundamentals, it could rise much higher once it launches, so interested parties should act sooner rather than later. It will have a max supply of 210 billion PEPENODE, with allocation spread between marketing, development, listings, node rewards, and its treasury. Judging by the popularity of its presale, which has now raised $2.25 million, it could have a very big 2026.

Each of these products offers direct exposure to XRP by holding the underlying asset and issuing shares that reflect its market value. All XRP ETF’s on Vanguard today! Choose your fighter.. https://t.co/MLhsgJPgkJ pic.twitter.com/FSx9MQzNU5 — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) December 2, 2025 In addition to spot exposure, Vanguard has also made leveraged XRP ETFs available. These include funds offering amplified daily returns as well as those structured around enhanced income strategies. Products issued by Volatility Shares, Teucrium, ProShares, and Amplify fall into this category, allowing investors to participate in XRP price movements at varying degrees of intensity without interacting with the token directly. Collectively, these offerings represent one of the broadest selections of XRP-linked ETFs available on any major U.S. brokerage platform. Rapid Growth in Cumulative Inflows Spot XRP ETFs have been drawing significant capital since the launch of the first U.S. product in mid-November. By December 1, combined inflows had reached approximately $756 million. Within the following day, this figure rose to about $824 million, reflecting a notable increase over a single trading session. The rise was driven by steady demand across the four active spot funds, all of which continued to attract new capital without recording any outflows. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market participants have pointed out that sustained inflows of this size could lead to a meaningful reduction in the supply of XRP available on public exchanges. Since spot ETF issuers must purchase XRP to support their shares, continued demand naturally leads to incremental accumulation. Community commentators, including Steingraber, argue that this dynamic may have long-term implications for liquidity, particularly if inflows remain consistent as more ETFs begin trading. Several new products are also approaching availability. The recently approved 21Shares XRP ETF, along with an upcoming fund from WisdomTree, is expected to join the lineup on Vanguard once final preparations are completed. Their introduction would broaden investor access further and may contribute to additional inflow momentum. Vanguard’s inclusion of a diverse range of XRP ETFs represents an important step toward deeper integration of digital assets within traditional investment channels. The combination of spot and leveraged products offers investors multiple approaches to gaining exposure, while the strong inflow patterns suggest growing institutional interest. As more ETFs join the platform and demand continues to rise, the role of XRP within regulated financial markets may expand considerably in the months ahead.

That makes it yet another pardon that has not been granted to Sam Bankman-Fried, who continues to be courting the President’s attention for clemency. On Polymarket , traders are pricing his pardon at a 2% chance, while traders from Kalshi only see a 4% chance that SBF is pardoned before the end of this year. The current level is proof that people think there is little chance he gets a pardon from the same man whose political rival he funded. SBF’s pardon odds. Source: Polymarket David Gentile will keep the cash he cheated people out of Trump has used the presidential clemency power, such as pardons and sentence commutations, on several high-profile cases, including the January 6 Capitol rioters, former Rep. George Santos, who pleaded guilty to felony wire fraud and identity theft charges, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao convicted of money laundering, and even reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were also convicted of financial crimes. Each pardon has raised eyebrows, but perhaps the one that has garnered the most reactions has been his commutation of Gentile’s sentence, even though the man had only served 12 days out of a seven-year prison sentence when he was released, according to the New York Times. It should be noted that what Gentile got was not a full pardon, which usually forgives the crime and restores rights; it was a commutation that shortens or ends the sentence but leaves the conviction intact. Of course, this specific commutation stands out because it also got rid of all remaining fines, restitution, and forfeiture obligations, which effectively means Gentile does not need to repay his victims or face any further financial penalties tied to the federal case. Gentile was the founder and CEO of GPB Capital, a company prosecutors say raised about $1.6 billion from investors based on misrepresented success of the private equity fund. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, while addressing the matter on December 1, implied that the case had been revisited because the Biden-era Justice Department that oversaw the prosecution mischaracterized it as a Ponzi scheme, and Gentile had concerns about false testimony. “In short, again this is another example that has been brought to the president’s attention of a weaponization of the justice of the previous administration,” she said, declining to answer questions about the victims in the case. According to records from the Bureau of Prisons, Gentile was released on November 26, the day before Thanksgiving. “I am also deeply grateful to see David Gentile heading home to his young children,” Trump’s “pardon czar” Alice Marie Johnson said on X . “These are miracles of mercy, and each one reminds us of the extraordinary power of second chances.” SBF renews hopes for a pardon Trump’s pardons have mostly been reserved for crypto-adjacent figures with lighter sentences and strong MAGA ties. SBF does not fit into either category with his billion-dollar fraud conviction and massive donation to support Biden. Still, SBF is not giving up hope. His parents, Stanford Law professors Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, have been doing their best to lobby Trump allies, including a lawyer from his 2016/2020 campaigns, as well as figures like Tucker Carlson, who conducted an interview with SBF in prison in March 2025. They’re framing the conviction as a “Democratic witch hunt,” in hopes that it will help paint a picture of him being targeted by the Biden administration, a move that worked well for the likes of David Gentile. SBF himself has also ramped up his social media activity, arguing FTX was solvent at collapse. In a recent post, he claimed that global FTX creditors could have benefited more if the lawyers had approved the exchange’s sales. There is also the fact that SBF shared a prison block with the former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who had been serving a 45-year sentence in the U.S. for drug trafficking and firearms offenses. When Trump pardoned Hernandez, calling it an act of “justice,” and claiming Hernández was “framed” by prosecutors, SBF reacted with enthusiasm, commenting via his X account, which is being run by a friend. “I’m so glad Juan Orlando is free—few are more deserving than him.” SBF described Hernández as “one of the kindest and most dedicated people I’ve met” and an “honor” to befriend, even “under the worst possible circumstances.” It was SBF’s second post praising a Trump pardon. Before that, he commented positively on the CZ commutation. Unfortunately, the convicted executive’s efforts have been insufficient in getting a look from President Trump, and bettors aren’t counting on it happening either.

Even in the post-halving bullish phase in its historical four-year cycle, it still trades 85% below its 2021 all-time high of $3.10. In a recent podcast , Hoskinson blamed this weak performance on the outsized influence of macroeconomic events on the crypto market. A headwind that is now clearing as the U.S. Fed makes a significant policy shift, ending quantitative tightening (QT) alongside a $13.5 billion liquidity boost for banks.

Despite persistent frustration within portions of the community due to forecasts that have not yet materialized, he maintains that targets as high as $33 remain achievable. His latest commentary combines technical reasoning with a broader message centered on discipline and endurance, urging investors to remain focused on long-term developments rather than short-term market swings. A Message Addressed to XRP Supporters Egrag’s recent update contained an unusually personal tone. He encouraged his audience to view the current phase of the market as a period that demands consistency and patience. He referenced teachings from major religious texts, including passages from the Bible, Torah, and Quran, as a way of underscoring the value of perseverance. He highlighted verses that speak to perseverance and testing, arguing that successful long-term investing requires similar qualities. According to him, remaining committed to an asset like XRP, despite repeated market setbacks, reflects both conviction and a willingness to endure uncertainty. #XRP – Green Ball and Then Blast ($17 – $27 – $33): Many of you send me DMs or leave comments asking, ""Aren't you tired of stating and showing different ways to reach these targets?""

In response, he emphasized that the conclusions he draws are based on observable data and historical behavior rather than sentiment. He stated that although enthusiasm within the community fluctuates, the foundation of his analysis remains consistent. Technical Basis for the Forecast The core of Egrag’s argument relies on patterns he identified in XRP’s multi-year price history. He focused particularly on the 2-week chart, where he observed that extended rallies often begin after the price returns to the 21-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA). This level, he noted, has repeatedly acted as an area where momentum begins to rebuild after prolonged consolidation. He drew attention to two previous examples . In 2017, XRP increased sharply after touching the 21 EMA, ultimately rising by more than twelvefold. A comparable pattern emerged in 2021, though the price increase was more moderate at roughly fivefold. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Using these two cases as reference points, he calculated an average potential gain of about 905% if XRP were to follow a similar trajectory again. Under this framework, he believes that values between $17 and $33 are reasonable outcomes for the next major upward move. Although earlier projections from Egrag have led to mixed reactions over the years, he asserted that the long-term chart continues to show constructive signals. He argued that market conditions often appear discouraging immediately before major shifts take place, making patience a crucial component of any investment strategy. Community Expectations and Market Sentiment Egrag cautioned that volatility is likely to persist and that emotional reactions from market participants can distort judgment. He stressed that his forecasts are based solely on technical indicators, emphasizing that market data remains consistent even when opinions differ. According to him, those who focus on long-term trends rather than short-term price fluctuations are more likely to benefit from future market cycles. Egrag’s renewed forecast underscores his belief that XRP’s long-term potential remains intact, provided investors maintain realistic expectations and a patient outlook. By combining historical price behavior with a message centered on discipline, he argues that the path to higher valuations remains possible even if the timeline is uncertain. As market sentiment shifts repeatedly, he continues to advise the XRP community to remain calm, focused, and committed to the broader trend rather than immediate price movements.

55319695,639159,1764806420,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55319695.jpeg,Vanguard’s Policy Reversal Triggers Sharp Bitcoin Rally as $11T Giant Enters Crypto,https://bitcoinist.com/vanguards-policy-reversal-triggers-bitcoin-rally/,"A new CryptoQuant report from XWIN Research Japan reveals that the sharp +6% Bitcoin rally on December 2–3, 2025 was triggered by a seismic shift in traditional finance: Vanguard’s unexpected policy reversal. The $11 trillion asset manager—long known for its conservative stance—opened its platform to spot ETFs for BTC, ETH, XRP, and SOL, instantly giving more than 50 million investors access to crypto products. The move marks one of the most significant steps toward mainstream adoption in the industry’s history. The catalyst behind this reversal was the appointment of Salim Ramji, Vanguard’s new CEO and a former BlackRock executive who played a key role in launching the IBIT ETF. His leadership signaled a dramatic change in direction, and the market responded immediately. Once US markets opened, Bitcoin surged 6% in a single move, while IBIT surpassed $1 billion in trading volume within the first 30 minutes. Massive inflows from retail and retirement accounts followed, with Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas noting that “a large wave of Vanguard clients may have moved all at once.” Institutional Demand Builds as Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Recovers XWIN Research Japan notes that, despite the recent surge, the Coinbase Premium Index remains in negative territory, showing that US prices still sit slightly below global averages. Even so, the report highlights a clear improvement in US spot buying pressure, signaling that demand is slowly returning. If the premium rises back to zero or positive territory, the market may begin to price in what XWIN calls the “next wave” — a phase that could propel Bitcoin toward the $100K range as institutional flows strengthen. This shift is happening just as Vanguard makes its historic entrance into the crypto market. XWIN emphasizes that this is not a short-term catalyst. Vanguard manages $11 trillion, and even a tiny allocation — just 0.5% of assets flowing into crypto ETFs — would represent $55 billion in new capital. That figure alone exceeds the entire first-year inflow from the 2024 spot Bitcoin ETF cycle. With the “final giant” of traditional finance now participating, the long-term structure of Bitcoin demand is changing. Vanguard’s move signals the beginning of a genuine institutional adoption phase, where inflows can scale far beyond anything seen in previous cycles, potentially redefining Bitcoin’s upper price boundaries. Price Rebounds From Weekly Support but Faces Major Resistance Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows a strong rebound from the $84,000–$86,000 support zone, an area that aligns closely with the 100-week SMA. This level acted as a critical pivot during previous corrections, and once again buyers stepped in aggressively, forming a clear bullish reaction. The long lower wick from last week’s candle confirms strong demand, with BTC now trading back above $93,000. However, despite the rebound, the broader structure remains cautious. Bitcoin still trades below the 50-week SMA, which has begun to flatten near the $102,000–$103,000 region. This moving average now acts as a major resistance level and the next key test for bulls. A weekly close above it would mark a meaningful shift in momentum and signal that BTC may be ready to resume its broader uptrend. If BTC continues to hold above the 100-week SMA and pushes toward the 50-week SMA, the market could enter a consolidation phase that sets the stage for a stronger upside move.

XRP Price Consolidation Nears Its End On the higher-timeframe 2-day chart, Osemka frames the structure as a classic flat correction built on top of the 2021 high. “Here’s the range and levels to help you navigate it. We’re basing on top of 2021 high,” he writes, adding that “we’ve also never broken down after going sideways for this long, so I remain with my view of this being an accumulation range and a flat correction.” Related Reading: XRP Whale Wallets Collapse 20%, But Biggest Holders Hoard More Than Ever His chart shows XRP oscillating in a horizontal band whose floor aligns with the 2021 high, labeled as a “Reaccumulation” area. Price has repeatedly tagged this support and bounced, while midrange resistance in the low-to-mid $2 zone has capped multiple rallies. Above, a higher horizontal line marks the January spike, which Osemka treats as the cycle top. Internally, he maps an A–B–C corrective sequence. The B leg forms a dotted ascending channel, labeled as a 3-legged “abc” wave. “That dotted ascending range in the middle (3 legged abc wave in B) has me optimistic as that is a corrective move that is synonymous for a flat correction,” he explains. “Meaning the top was in January and this indeed is only a sideways correction.” The current C leg is contained within a downward “Corrective channel” pointing back toward the lower band. For Osemka, even a deeper test of support would not necessarily be bearish for the larger structure: “If we end up taking the lower end of the range with C leg it’ll remain to be seen. But if so, it’d be a great buying opportunity.” He also calls XRP “a perfect example on why I view BTC also as a flat correction with the top in January,” arguing that “while Bitcoin is messy, XRP is very clean.” Why Its Now Or Never For XRP Dom zooms in on the last six weeks of that broader range and focuses on the microstructure that could trigger a move back toward the upper band. “If you inverse the chart over the last 6 weeks, you’ll see a perfect 3 drive pattern, a very accurate reversal setup in crypto,” he writes. On the non-inverted chart, this corresponds to three downside pushes that fail to extend lower, followed by what he calls a higher low: “We can see a HL has finally formed which can hint at the first sign of a trend change developing.” His 8-hour chart highlights the monthly rolling VWAP as the key pivot. “Bulls needs to regain the monthly rVWAP around $2.22 and that would be the shift for a rally back towards ~$2.50,” Dom says. That ~$2.50 area aligns with higher VWAP clusters and the upper portion of Osemka’s range. Related Reading: XRP Price About $1,000 Is A Necessity, Analyst Claims Order-book and skew data back his view that conditions are ripe for a break if buyers step in. “Orderbooks are clear, if there was a time, it’s now for this trend to shift,” he notes, pointing to relatively clean liquidity overhead and a recovering skew after a washed-out short side. The downside is equally explicit: “If this setup fails, acceptance under $2 is next and the end of year is ugly.” That would mean a decisive loss of the long-defended support band built on the 2021 high and a deeper completion of the C leg in Osemka’s flat-correction structure. For now, XRP remains compressed between the $2.00 support, the $2.22 monthly rVWAP trigger and the ~$2.50 upside magnet, with the six-week 3-drive pattern and flat-correction range jointly defining one of the clearest technical inflection points on the XRP chart this year. At press time, XRP traded at $2.1798.

Price dropped toward the True Market Mean, the cost basis of all active coins minus miners, and then held there. According to Glassnode, that level splits light bear phases from deep bear markets. For now, price is sitting just above it. The structure around it now matches what showed up in Q1 2022 almost tick for tick. Spot price moved under the 0.75 supply quantile in mid‑November and now trades near $96.1K, putting more than 25% of total supply underwater. At the same time, sellers may already be worn out. The line that changes everything is still the 0.85 quantile near $106.2K. Until price takes that level back, macro shocks keep full control of direction. Glassnode data shows that Bitcoin’s Net Change in Realized Cap reads +$8.69B per month, which is pretty weak compared to the $64.3B per month peak in July, but it is not exactly negative either. As long as this stays above zero, price can still build a base instead of falling apart. Meanwhile, long‑term investors continue to sell into strength, but at shrinking margins, with the Long‑Term Holder SOPR (30D‑SMA) stands at 1.43. Derivatives and options reset risk across the board Spot demand now looks lighter. U.S. Bitcoin ETFs flipped into net outflows across November on a three‑day average basis. The steady inflow that supported price earlier this year is gone. Outflows hit many issuers at once. Institutions pulled back as market pressure built. That leaves price more exposed to outside shocks. At the same time, Cumulative Volume Delta turned negative on Binance and across the aggregate exchange group. That signals steady taker selling. Coinbase flattened as well. That removed a key sign of U.S. bid strength. With ETF flows and CVD both defensive, spot demand now runs thin. Derivatives followed the same path. Futures open interest kept falling through late November. The unwind stayed slow and orderly. The leverage built during the uptrend is now mostly gone. New leverage is not entering. Funding rates cooled near zero after months of positive prints. Modest negative funding showed up at times but never lasted long. Shorts are not pressing hard. Positioning now sits neutral and flat. In options, implied volatility dropped after last week’s spike. Bitcoin failed to hold above $92K, and sellers stepped back in, so short‑dated volatility fell from 57% to 48%, mid‑tenor slid from 52% to 45%, and long‑dated eased from 49% to 47%. Short‑term skew fell from 18.6% to 8.4% after Bitcoin’s price rebounded from $84.5K, a drop tied to the Japanese bond shock. Longer maturities moved slower. Traders chased short‑term upside but stayed unsure about follow‑through. Early week flow leaned heavy on put buying tied to fears of a repeat of the August 2024 carry‑trade stress. Once price stabilized, flow flipped to calls during the rebound. At the $100K call strike, call premium sold still exceeds call premium bought, and the gap widened during the past 48 hours. That shows weak conviction to reclaim six figures. Traders also sit ahead of the FOMC meeting without chasing upside.

Leverage rises with long/short ratios above 2.2 on major venues, amplifying liquidation risks. Spot outflows slow, with a modest $620K inflow marking the first positive reading in weeks. By Parshwa Turakhiya Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) is attempting to stabilize after a two-month slide that pushed the token to a low near $0.13, marking one of its deepest drawdowns of the year. The recovery toward $0.15 reflects tentative dip-buying interest, but the broader structure remains defined by a persistent downtrend channel and a market still unwinding excess leverage. DOGE has not collapsed, yet the burden of proof has shifted firmly onto buyers. The daily chart continues to show DOGE respecting a clean descending channel, with overhead resistance between $0.158 and $0.165, where the mid-channel boundary intersects the 20-day EMA. A rejection here would keep downward momentum intact and risk a retest of the lower channel line near $0.125, a level that has repeatedly acted as a liquidity floor. DOGE price analysis (Source: TradingView) The more decisive battleground sits higher, between $0.171 and $0.18. This zone aligns with the 50-day EMA and a horizontal shelf that capped price action throughout early Q4. Until DOGE clears that area, rallies remain corrective rather than structural. Yet the long-term accumulation base stretching back to March continues to hold. As long as the price stays above $0.128–$0.13, Dogecoin avoids structural damage and maintains the slow-build accumulation narrative that has underpinned its broader cycle. A breakdown below that floor would shift the market toward deeper support at $0.105–$0.11, an area known for abrupt and volatile reversals when liquidity thins and shorts overextend. Momentum indicators reflect this transitional phase. RSI sits near 45, rising from oversold territory but not yet signaling trend reversal. Historically, DOGE requires a breakout of the 55–60 RSI band to trigger sustained upside, a threshold the market has yet to approach. Flows and positioning reveal a market repairing, not rallying Spot flows show a market that has shed considerable risk. Repeated $40–100 million net outflows through September and October underscored investor reluctance to commit capital. The most recent print, however, shows a $620,000 inflow, the first positive reading in weeks. While small, it indicates the bleeding has slowed and sellers are no longer dominating every bounce. The derivatives market tells a more complicated story. Open interest has risen 8.6 percent to $1.5 billion, with volume jumping 42 percent. Long/short ratios above 2.2 on major venues point to a heavily long-biased market, meaning the current bounce is driven by leverage rather than organic spot demand. If DOGE fails to break resistance, these leveraged longs risk liquidation cascades that could accelerate downside entirely through mechanical unwinds. This dynamic is not unfamiliar. The last time DOGE saw rising open interest during a downtrend, the market was setting up for a washout that ultimately produced the late-Q1 rally. Rising leverage into weakness is historically fragile. A controlled squeeze lower could clear positioning and reset conditions for a healthier upside attempt - an outcome paradoxically favorable for medium-term bulls. The short-term roadmap remains binary. A reclaim of $0.171–$0.18 would break the downtrend and open room toward $0.20–$0.21, where the 200-day EMA sits and where prior rallies failed. Conversely, a drop below $0.138–$0.14 would expose DOGE to a liquidity flush toward $0.115, a level where mean-reversion traders historically step in aggressively. A market digesting, not collapsing The deeper narrative surrounding DOGE is one of digestion rather than deterioration. The token is shedding speculative leverage accumulated earlier in the year while attempting to stabilize above long-term support. Spot selling has slowed, derivatives positioning is stretched but active, and sentiment remains hesitant but not despairing. DOGE is now balanced between two competing forces: cheap enough to interest value-focused buyers, but not strong enough to force shorts to unwind. The next test of resistance will determine whether this bounce becomes a trend or fades into another liquidity event in a market still detoxing from its last cycle. In earlier coverage, we noted that Dogecoin’s structure had entered a slow-grind corrective phase rather than a collapse, with long-term support levels showing resilience even as leverage unwound. The current price behavior aligns with that view. DOGE is still repairing, not reversing, and the key catalysts ahead remain its ability to reclaim EMAs and reverse the descending channel that has defined sentiment since early Q4.

According to reports from Bloomberg and the Financial Times, drones sweep across rooftops, scanning for strange heat signals inside abandoned houses, vacant shops, and other dead zones. These hot spots almost always point to rigs running nonstop. On the ground, police walk with handheld sensors that pick up unusual electricity use. Citizens allegedly report birds chirping all night, but it’s just fake sounds playing on speakers to cover the roar of mining machines behind locked doors. Miners move quickly. They set up in one place, install heat shields to hide their equipment, mount CCTV cameras, and wire their entrances with broken glass. Then they vanish before authorities arrive. Over the last five years, officers have tracked down 14,000 illegal sites linked to power theft.That’s what the Energy Ministry said in the latest breakdown.The damage to Tenaga Nasional, Malaysia’s state-owned utility, has hit around $1.1 billion and counting. By October, 3,000 new cases had already been logged just this year as Bitcoin’s price went up, crashed over 30 percent, and started rising again. Taskforce forms to chase down mining operators On November 19, Malaysia launched a new taskforce made up of the Ministry of Finance, Bank Negara Malaysia, and TNB. Akmal Nasrullah Mohd Nasir, who serves as deputy minister of energy transition and water transformation, is in charge of the team. “You can actually even break our facilities. It becomes a challenge to our system,” Akmal said on Wednesday. The rigs that miners use run around the clock, blasting out trillions of guesses every second. That’s how they validate transactions and get rewarded in Bitcoin. It’s a race. The more guesses you make, the better your odds. But it also burns massive amounts of electricity. One group turned ElementX Mall, a half-dead shopping center overlooking the Strait of Malacca, into a full-on crypto farm. The mall shut down during the pandemic and never bounced back. Floors are still unfinished. Wires hang from the ceiling. In early 2022, Bitcoin rigs filled the space. By 2025, they were gone. A TikTok video made the whole thing public. A report from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance said over 75 percent of mining now happens in the United States. Malaysia used to hold 2.5 percent of global hashrate in January 2022, but Chainalysis hasn’t released a report/data on that since then. Miners occupy failed malls, logging sites across country Another outfit called Bityou took over a former logging yard in Sarawak. Under Malaysian law, Bitcoin mining is legal. But only if you get your power legally and pay your taxes. Akmal isn’t buying it. He’s joined raids before. He’s seen how these groups operate. When the taskforce held its first meeting on November 25, some members pushed to outlaw mining altogether. “Even if you run it properly, the challenge is that the market itself is very volatile,” Akmal said . “I don’t see any well-run mining that can be considered as successful legally.” He also thinks the way these operations move around shows signs of organized crime. “It’s clearly run by the syndicate, because of how mobile they are from setting up in one place to another place,” Akmal said. “It does have modus operandi.” Get seen where it counts.

CryptoQuant reports that the company’s monthly purchases decreased from 134,000 BTC at the 2024 peak to just 9,100 BTC in November 2025, with only 135 BTC so far this month. According to the data analytics firm, the 24-month buffer is a clear indication that Strategy is bracing for the bear market. On November 17th, Strategy acquired 8,178 BTC for approximately $835.5 million, its largest purchase since July, bringing its total holdings to 649,870 BTC, valued at approximately $58.7 billion at the time of writing. The firm has been the subject of intense speculation over the last several months following a downturn in the crypto market and the unwinding of the BTC proxy trade , which included digital asset treasury companies that accumulate crypto and mining operations. Strategy secures $1.4B cash reserve Just a few weeks ago, Strategy CEO Phong Le said the company might sell some of its Bitcoin to cover debt costs , but only if its stock falls below net asset value (NAV) or if it loses access to financing. The company has also set aside a $1.4 billion cash reserve to cover dividend payments and debt obligations. This reserve is expected to provide a 12-month runway, with plans to expand it to cover 24 months, the company added. Strategy’s attempt to join major stock market indexes has faced obstacles.MSCI, which sets eligibility criteria for many of these indexes, has suggested a policy change that would bar treasury companies holding 50% or more of their balance-sheet assets in digital assets. The directive would cut off firms like Strategy from the passive inflows that come with index inclusion. Michael Saylor, the co-founder of Strategy, recently stated that Strategy is engaging with MSCI regarding the proposed policy change, which is set to take effect in January. Bitcoin bounces to align with industry cost benchmarks Bitcoin is closely monitored with the Difficulty Regression Model, according t o checkonchai n . This model estimates the all-in sustaining production cost for the network. The model treats mining difficulty as a distilled measure of mining price, as it incorporates all major operational variables into a single figure. This provides a n industry-wide estimate of the average cost to produce one Bitcoin, eliminating the need for detailed assumptions about hardware, energ y expens es, or logistics. This model is currently priced at approximately $92,300, roughly the same as Bitcoin’s spot price. Bitcoin tumbled briefly to around $80,000 but has since come back to the model. When Bitcoin moves above the model, then it tends to signal a bull market; when its price moves beneath it, it often indicates a bear market. In April 2025, Bitcoin dropped to $76,000, but was supported at the model’s value. Bitcoin was traded roughly 50% above the model for the majority of 2025; in 2024, however, prices stayed closer to it. Bitcoin was quoted as much as 50% below the model during the 2022 bear market. In previous bull markets, it has soared far above the model — doubling its price at the 2021 peak and five times the model’s value in 2017. As Bitcoin matures into an asset, premiums near those levels seem a thing of the past. Overall, the model suggests Bitcoin is currently priced near its production cost, which can be interpreted as a fair value zone . Metcalfe’s bas ed valuations also place bitcoin near fair value around $90,000, reinforcing that assessment.

RSI near 66 signals strong but cooling momentum. On chain flows turn mildly positive after prolonged weakness. By Ashutosh Sureka Uniswap ( UNI-USD ) is trading at $6.07, up 10.7% in the past 24 hours, extending its rebound after a sharp recovery from the mid-$5.40 zone. The market cap stands at $3.82 billion, while daily trading volume at $498.52 million reflects heavy participation as buyers returned aggressively after yesterday’s capitulation drop. The day’s range between $5.39 and $6.17 highlights strong intraday volatility as UNI stabilizes above a key short-term resistance band. Uniswap price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Technical structure analysis UNI remains below major EMAs on higher timeframes, but short-term structure shows clear improvement. The 20 EMA sits near $5.87, the 50 EMA near $5.93, the 100 EMA around $6.02, and the 200 EMA close to $6.03. Price has reclaimed the faster EMAs and is now pressing directly into the heavier 100 and 200 EMAs, signalling early trend repair though not yet a confirmed breakout. RSI on the 1-hour chart sits near 66.63 after an earlier spike toward 79.06, showing strong momentum that has cooled but remains constructive. UNI needs a decisive break above $6.20 for continuation, while slipping below $5.85 risks reopening downside toward last week’s lows. On-chain flows analysis On-chain flows have turned mildly positive after weeks of persistent red prints. Coinglass data shows a net inflow of about $762.17k on 3 December, marking one of the strongest green spikes in recent sessions. This follows a long period of heavy outflows throughout October and November, during which market cap compression mirrored retreating sentiment. The latest stabilization in market cap suggests selective rotation back into DeFi despite overall caution. Sentiment and fundamentals UNI’s broader tone has improved as DeFi assets staged a sector-wide rebound. Liquidity remains thin, but whale accumulation has supported the recovery. However, strong overhead supply between $6.15 and $6.30 continues to cap momentum. Protocol-level developments have not yet sparked a major shift in behaviour, meaning sustained progress still depends on broader market tone and improved flow dynamics. Short-term outlook UNI has shown a strong intraday recovery with early signs of stabilization. Holding above $5.85 keeps the constructive structure intact, while clearing $6.20 is required to confirm a deeper push higher. Without this breakout, UNI remains vulnerable to pullbacks if broader sentiment weakens. In earlier analysis, UNI was trading near $5.48 with persistent outflows, heavy EMA resistance overhead, and weak momentum near oversold territory. Today’s rebound marks the first meaningful structural improvement since that decline, but confirmation still requires reclaiming the $6.20 level.

Related Reading: Crypto Investors Brace As Japan Proposes 20% Tax By 2027 The move follows a month-long slide that erased nearly 20% from recent highs and raised questions about whether the broader uptrend was losing strength. Consequently, about $250 million in BTC short positions have been liquidated. Institutional Access Expands as Vanguard Lifts ETF Ban The most notable catalyst for the rebound came from Vanguard, which reversed its long-standing ban on Bitcoin ETFs . The decision immediately opened access to tens of millions of retail accounts and allowed products such as BlackRock’s IBIT to trade on the platform, generating more than $1 billion in volume on day one. The policy shift triggered a rapid surge in demand and helped fuel more than $400 million in short liquidations as Bitcoin jumped from the mid-$88,000 area to above $93,000 within hours. Analysts note that several major firms, including Robinhood and Fidelity, added significant BTC exposure during the session. Combined with stablecoin issuers expanding supply in recent weeks, liquidity across the crypto market has broadened. Macro Shifts and Technical Levels Support the Recovery The rebound coincided with the U.S. Federal Reserve ending its quantitative tightening programme and injecting fresh funds into short-term markets. Repo facility usage also increased, improving liquidity for risk assets. Traders now assign high probability to a rate cut at the Fed’s December meeting. Across the market , major assets followed Bitcoin higher. Ethereum traded near $3,000, Solana reached $142, and XRP climbed back above $2.18. Market indexes tracking large-cap cryptocurrencies rose around 7%, while the Crypto Fear & Greed Index moved off extreme fear levels. Technical indicators are showing early signs of stabilisation. Analysts highlight the $86,000–$88,000 range as a key support zone that has held through repeated tests in recent months. Bitcoin is also pressing against resistance between $92,500 and $94,000, forming an ascending triangle pattern. Renewed $100K Bitcoin Targets, but Debate Over Trend Strength Remains Despite the strong bounce, analysts remain divided on whether Bitcoin is entering a renewed expansion phase or simply retracing after a sharp correction. Some warn that deeper downtrends historically unfold over longer periods. Others argue that rising institutional participation and on-chain activity resemble previous mid-cycle resets rather than the start of a prolonged decline.

Related Reading: XRP Is About To Hit A Major Turning Point This Week, Analyst Says The well-known investor/entrepreneur said he is not investing as if the Fed will ease policy, and he thinks Bitcoin will likely drift within 5% of its current level. Fed Cut Odds Skyrocketing According to the CME FedWatch Tool, markets are now pricing in an 89% chance of a December rate cut, a big swing from just weeks earlier when odds were far lower. This shift in expectations has been a main driver of recent moves in risk assets, including crypto. LATEST 🚨 Kevin O’Leary just said a December Fed rate cut is unlikely because inflation is still too high! He also said “It’s not going to make a difference to Bitcoin.” Do you agree? 🤔 pic.twitter.com/lJBrW4Z2kA — That Martini Guy ₿ (@MartiniGuyYT) December 3, 2025 Bitcoin Reacts To Shift In Sentiment Based on reports from market trackers, Bitcoin climbed after a recent dip, recovering from a low near $83,000 to trade around $93,700 in early trading sessions. Coingecko listed the price roughly in the $92,700–$92,800 band during morning trade. Traders point to support at $90,000 and resistance near $92,500, and some desk notes say a clean break above that could open a run toward $94K–$95K. Why O’Leary Is Skeptical O’Leary has flagged higher prices in the economy and sticky input costs as reasons the Fed might hold off. Reports show US consumer prices rose at a 3% annual rate in September, the fastest since January, a datapoint he cited to argue inflation still matters. The inflation numbers are being watched closely by policymakers weighing the trade-off between jobs and prices. Liquidity Moves Add Fuel Reports have disclosed that the Fed quietly put more than $13 billion of liquidity into short-term funding, a move some analysts say has helped restore liquidity in money markets and supported risk assets. That liquidity boost, together with the pause in Quantitative Tightening, has been flagged by quant desks as one reason bullish momentum returned to crypto. Market Reaction O’Leary’s take is at odds with the market odds and with several analysts who see easier monetary policy as a tailwind for assets like Bitcoin. He is not alone in warning against reading too much into a single Fed decision, but many traders have already positioned for easing and that positioning has moved prices.

But is it better?",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/silver-higher-than-gold-but-is-it-better/,"Silver is outperforming gold in 2025, and it’s all because demand has blown past what miners can dig up, while electronics, electric vehicles, and solar companies are all grabbing for the same shrinking pile of metal. As of early December, silver has doubled in price year-to-date, while gold surged by 60% in comparison. Both metals are having the time of their lives though, as investors are steadily ducking out of fiat and into hard assets. But it’s silver that’s flashing red on the supply side, and it’s not built to handle this kind of squeeze. Inventories are scraping the bottom. Supply isn’t keeping up. The risk now is broader: companies across sectors could face shortages if the current pace holds. The market is already showing signs of stress, and nobody’s stepping in to bail it out. There’s no silver equivalent of central banks lending metal into the system like they do with gold. When liquidity dries up here, it just… dries up. Silver moves electricity better than almost anything on earth, which is why it’s built into circuit boards, switches, batteries, and charging stations. But with margins already thin, high silver costs make it harder to stay profitable. Jewelry demand for silver is still strong, especially in China and India, where silver is passed down as a family asset. The three biggest silver producers are Mexico, Peru, and China, who right now are dealing with everything from regulatory delays to environmental crackdowns. ETF flows, weak mining, and option bets trap Silver investors. Do they have a plan? According to data from LSEG, the global total silver stash is currently under $50 billion. For comparison, gold sits at around $1.2 trillion, with a huge chunk of that in central bank vaults (especially the Bank of England) where it can be lent into markets when things get tight. That system doesn’t exist for silver, so yeah, it’s every trader for themselves. Still, silver is cheap per ounce compared to gold too, so it is so much easier to buy for retail investors, though also riskier. But for those guys, this is a non-issue. Meanwhile, physical silver-backed ETFs picked up 15.7 million ounces in November alone. Holdings have climbed in 9 of the last 11 months. These are active bets on supply staying tight and prices staying hot. But it’s not just ETFs. The options market is on fire too. Jonathan Krinsky, chief markets technician at BTIG, pointed out that the iShares Silver Trust (SLV), which tracks the metal’s performance, posted three straight daily gains of 2.5% or more in the past week. “That’s only happened five other times in the ETF’s history (back to ’06). Four of the five occurred either at, or right before, a major peak for SLV,” he said. Silver skew (a measure of call-option demand over puts) jumped 8 points to hit 10 percentage points in two weeks, which is the highest since March 2022 and also means that betting on an upside just got a lot more expensive.

Jacob King, CEO of crypto media outlet SwanDesk, has launched a stunning critique against MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, a famed Bitcoin bull. King claims Saylor has reversed his Bitcoin predictions approximately 50 times, with all of them ultimately proving incorrect. This bold accusation challenges the narrative surrounding one of crypto’s most vocal advocates. What Are the Specific Criticisms of Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin Predictions? Jacob King’s criticism extends beyond mere inconsistency. He contrasts Saylor’s long-term bullish forecasts with Bitcoin’s short-term volatility. King points out that while the U.S. dollar lost 39% of its purchasing power over 19 years, Bitcoin experienced a similar drop in just two weeks. From this, he draws a controversial conclusion: the cryptocurrency is ‘useless’ as a stable store of value. This directly attacks the core ‘digital gold’ thesis that Saylor and many others passionately defend. How Do Saylor’s Own Forecasts Contradict This Criticism? The criticism becomes even more intriguing when held against Saylor’s own very public and optimistic Bitcoin predictions . In a previous CNBC interview, Saylor outlined a staggering roadmap for BTC’s future: Reaching $150,000 by the end of this year. Climbing to $1 million within the next four to eight years. Ascending to an almost unimaginable $20 million within two decades. These forecasts form the bedrock of his public stance, making King’s claim of 50 reversals a serious allegation of hypocrisy or poor analysis. Why Does This Debate About Bitcoin Predictions Matter? This isn’t just a war of words between two executives. It highlights a fundamental tension in the crypto market between evangelistic long-term belief and pragmatic short-term scrutiny. For investors, understanding the track record of influential voices is crucial. Inconsistent Bitcoin predictions can create market noise and confusion, making it harder for individuals to separate hype from credible analysis. This debate forces the community to ask: should price forecasts be the primary measure of a cryptocurrency’s value? What Can We Learn From This Clash of Perspectives? Ultimately, this episode serves as a powerful reminder for every crypto participant. It underscores the importance of conducting your own research (DYOR) rather than blindly following any single figure, no matter how prominent. Market predictions, especially in a nascent and volatile asset class like cryptocurrency, are inherently uncertain. The key takeaway is to focus on underlying technology, adoption metrics, and macroeconomic factors, not just charismatic Bitcoin predictions . In summary , the clash between SwanDesk’s Jacob King and MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor exposes the volatile and often contradictory nature of cryptocurrency commentary. While Saylor paints a picture of Bitcoin’s inevitable mega-rise, King counters with accusations of unreliable forecasting and highlights its extreme price swings. For the savvy observer, the truth likely lies somewhere in between, emphasizing the need for critical thinking and a diversified perspective in the dynamic world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: How many times does Jacob King claim Michael Saylor reversed his Bitcoin price predictions? A: Jacob King, CEO of SwanDesk, claims that Michael Saylor has reversed his Bitcoin price predictions approximately 50 times. Q: What was Michael Saylor’s most optimistic Bitcoin price prediction? A: In a CNBC interview, Saylor predicted Bitcoin could reach $150,000 by year-end, $1 million in 4-8 years, and a staggering $20 million within 20 years. Q: Why does Jacob King argue Bitcoin is ‘useless’? A: King compares metrics, noting that while the US dollar’s purchasing power fell 39% over 19 years, Bitcoin fell by the same amount in just two weeks, leading him to question its utility as a stable store of value. Q: Who is Michael Saylor? A: Michael Saylor is the co-founder and Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy (MSTR), a business intelligence company that has made massive Bitcoin purchases, making him one of the most prominent corporate advocates for BTC. Q: What is the main lesson for investors from this debate? A: The key lesson is the importance of independent research (DYOR) and not relying solely on the predictions of any single individual, no matter how influential, due to the inherent volatility and uncertainty of cryptocurrency markets.

With momentum building and key resistance levels now within reach, the market is bracing for what could be a major explosive move. BTC Climbs Above 93,160 As Cup & Handle Targets 104,000 Charting BTC on the 4-hour timeframe, analyst Kamile Uray revealed that the price is currently moving above the $93,160 level. Uray is closely monitoring the price, as a successful close above this level would confirm the breakout of a recently formed cup and handle pattern. According to this classic pattern, a confirmed breakout targets the $104,000 level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rallies Into Resistance With Traders Watching for Breakout Confirmation If BTC reaches the $104,000 target without forming a wicking reversal, it would also decisively break the falling blue trendline. Breaking both this trendline and the pattern target would provide strong evidence for the continuation of the overall uptrend. The analyst highlighted that the next major resistances are located at the $98,200 and $107,500 levels. A break above $107,500 and the falling blue trend on the daily chart will serve as the ultimate sign that the long-term uptrend is fully resumed. Uray suggests that retests after the breakout of the pink box ( the handle resistance area) can be evaluated as potential trade entries. The mandatory stop-loss for these trades should be placed at a daily close below the pink box, maintaining strict risk management. Conversely, should the price fail to hold the pink box, the immediate support zone to watch is the $83,822 – $82,477 region below. A bearish scenario is confirmed by a daily close below $82,477, signaling a continuation of the downtrend. In this case, the market would likely seek the next support zone at $74,496 – $71,237, which represents the previous top broken in November 2024. If this zone holds, a major uptrend reversal could be expected again. IH&S Pattern Confirms Reversal Momentum According to a recent update by Crypto VIP Signal, Bitcoin’s recent price action has confirmed a significant bullish reversal. The asset has successfully surpassed the $87,500 mark and has also broken through the key level of $90,000. This upward movement confirms that the Inverse Head and Shoulders (IH&S) pattern has acted as expected, triggering a strong trend reversal signal. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders See First Uptick Since April Lows: Bullish Sign? The analyst noted that the current market structure appears strong because the price increase is being supported by healthy trading volume. With the reversal confirmed, Crypto VIP Signal noted that the next technical benchmark for the market is $95,000, and it will be interesting to see how the price behaves when it tests this resistance point.

55324874,639271,1764813647,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55324874.jpeg,Crypto-To-Politics Donation Pipeline Under Threat As UK Mulls Ban,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-money-politics-uk-officials-move-toward-ban/,"Britain is weighing a ban on crypto political donations as lawmakers raise alarm over traceability and foreign influence. Reports have disclosed that ministers are discussing a move to bar parties and candidates from accepting gifts in cryptocurrency as part of changes tied to the upcoming Elections Bill. Who Is Likely To Be Hit? Reform UK , which has already opened a portal to take bitcoin and other digital tokens, would be directly affected if a ban goes ahead. Reports show Reform became the first European party to accept crypto donations in late May 2025, and the move has drawn fresh attention to how digital coins can be used in politics. Campaign finance figures underline the stakes. In recent reporting, the Conservative Party raised £6.3 million in the first half of the year compared with Reform’s £2.1 million over the same period — numbers that help explain why any new fundraising channel is politically sensitive. Why Officials Say They Are Worried According to ministers and watchdogs, the problem is not the technology itself but the way tokens can hide who is really sending money. Wallets on blockchains are pseudonymous, and tools exist that can mix or obscure transactions, making it hard to link a donation to a named donor. That raises the risk of foreign or illicit funds slipping into UK campaigns. UK Eyes #Crypto Political Donation Ban, Threatening Farage’s Reform War Chest UK government considers banning #crypto political donations, treatening Nigel Farage’s Reform UK fundraising pic.twitter.com/cTIghUkbGn — CryptOpus (@ImCryptOpus) December 2, 2025 Groups that track corruption have backed stronger rules. Spotlight on corruption and other campaigners have urged lawmakers to close loopholes and give regulators clearer powers to trace suspect funding. They say more than guidance is needed; legal changes and extra resources for investigators will be necessary if the system is to be effective. Crypto Donation Ban: How Enforcement Could Become Difficult Even if Parliament were to require crypto donations to be converted into pounds within a set period or funneled only through regulated providers, enforcement would remain tricky. Some officials believe new offences tied to illicit political funding and better police tools would be needed, while others warn that drafting workable rules will take time. Full Or Partial Ban? Lawmakers will debate whether to introduce a full ban, a partial ban, or tighter rules that force transparency and use of vetted intermediaries. Reports indicate the idea is under active discussion, but it is unclear whether change can be written into law before the next election cycle. Reform UK leaders have said they already accept crypto donations and view them as part of a wider pitch to voters; critics argue the timing and lack of clear oversight make that risky.

This vision is becoming reality as traditional banking embraces blockchain technology. In a groundbreaking move, Hana Financial Group has partnered with Dunamu, operator of South Korea’s largest crypto exchange Upbit, to integrate blockchain for remittances into their financial services. This collaboration signals a major shift in how traditional institutions approach cross-border payments. Why Is This Partnership a Game-Changer for Blockchain for Remittances? The December 4th announcement represents more than just another corporate partnership. It marks a significant moment where established financial giants recognize blockchain’s potential to solve real-world problems. Traditional remittance systems often suffer from high costs, slow processing times, and opaque tracking. However, blockchain for remittances offers a compelling alternative with its decentralized ledger technology. According to the memorandum of understanding signed at Hana Financial’s headquarters, the companies plan to develop new financial services that leverage blockchain’s strengths. The timing is particularly interesting as financial institutions worldwide explore digital asset integration. This partnership positions both companies at the forefront of South Korea’s financial innovation landscape. What Specific Services Will Use Blockchain Technology? The implementation will occur in carefully planned phases, beginning with internal transfers. Here’s what the rollout looks like: Phase One (Q1 2024) : Hana Bank will implement blockchain for remittances between its headquarters and overseas branches Phase Two : Expansion to subsidiaries and partner institutions Future Applications : Integration into broader foreign exchange operations and Hana Money service This gradual approach allows for testing and refinement while minimizing disruption to existing services. The phased rollout demonstrates practical wisdom in adopting new technology within regulated financial environments. How Will Blockchain Transform Overseas Money Transfers? Traditional international transfers face several challenges that blockchain directly addresses. Conventional systems rely on multiple intermediaries, each adding time and cost to transactions. In contrast, blockchain for remittances creates a more direct pathway for funds. The benefits customers can expect include: Faster Processing : Transactions that previously took days could complete in minutes Reduced Costs : Lower intermediary fees translate to better rates for customers Enhanced Transparency : Real-time tracking of transfer status Improved Security : Cryptographic protection against fraud and errors These improvements matter particularly for South Korea’s substantial expatriate community and international business sector. The partnership’s success could inspire similar initiatives across Asia’s financial landscape. What Challenges Might This Innovation Face? Despite the exciting potential, implementing blockchain for remittances at scale presents challenges. Regulatory compliance remains paramount, especially in South Korea’s carefully monitored financial sector. The partnership must navigate existing financial regulations while pioneering new approaches. Technical integration represents another consideration. Merging legacy banking systems with blockchain infrastructure requires careful planning and execution. User adoption forms the final piece – customers must trust and understand the new system enough to use it regularly. However, the combined expertise of Hana Financial’s banking experience and Dunamu’s blockchain knowledge creates a strong foundation for overcoming these hurdles. Their collaborative approach suggests they’re prepared for the implementation journey ahead. Conclusion: A New Era for Financial Services The Hana Financial-Dunamu partnership represents more than a technological upgrade – it signals a fundamental shift in how financial institutions approach innovation. By embracing blockchain for remittances , they’re addressing genuine customer pain points while positioning themselves for the digital finance future. This collaboration demonstrates that traditional banking and cryptocurrency sectors can work together to create practical solutions. As the first quarter 2024 implementation approaches, the financial world will watch closely. Success could accelerate blockchain adoption across global banking, making international money transfers faster, cheaper, and more transparent for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions When will Hana Financial’s blockchain remittance service launch? The service will launch in phases, beginning with internal transfers between Hana Bank’s headquarters and overseas branches in the first quarter of 2024. Expansion to broader services will follow gradually. Will this partnership involve cryptocurrencies directly? While Dunamu operates the Upbit cryptocurrency exchange, the initial focus appears to be on using blockchain technology to improve traditional remittance systems rather than introducing direct cryptocurrency transfers. How will blockchain make remittances cheaper? Blockchain reduces the number of intermediaries involved in cross-border transfers, which typically lowers processing fees. The transparent nature of blockchain also helps identify and eliminate unnecessary costs in the transfer chain. Is this service only for South Korean customers? Initially, the service will connect Hana Bank’s Korean headquarters with its international branches. However, as the service expands, it will likely become available to more customers conducting transfers between South Korea and other countries. How does this compare to existing blockchain remittance services? This partnership is significant because it involves a major traditional bank integrating blockchain technology into its established services, potentially bringing blockchain benefits to customers who prefer using conventional banking channels. What security measures will protect these blockchain transactions? Blockchain technology provides inherent security through cryptographic verification and decentralized record-keeping. Additionally, as a regulated financial institution, Hana Financial will implement additional security protocols compliant with financial regulations.

The widely watched Crypto Fear & Greed Index has taken another dip, falling to a reading of 26. This move deeper into ‘Fear’ territory signals a significant shift in market psychology. But what does this number truly mean for your portfolio, and is it a warning sign or a potential opportunity? Let’s decode the sentiment. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Telling Us Now? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a crucial barometer for market emotion. It operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 means ‘Extreme Fear,’ while 100 signals ‘Extreme Greed.’ The recent drop to 26 is a clear indicator that fear, not optimism, is the dominant force driving trader decisions. This index isn’t just a feeling; it’s a data-driven composite. It analyzes: Volatility (25%) : Sharp price swings often correlate with panic. Market Volume (25%) : High volume during downturns can indicate selling pressure. Social Media (15%) : The tone and volume of conversations on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%) : Direct sentiment polls from the community. Bitcoin Dominance (10%) : A flight to Bitcoin often signals risk-off behavior. Google Trends (10%) : Search interest for terms like ‘Bitcoin crash’. Why Should You Care About Market Sentiment? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is vital because markets are driven by human psychology as much as fundamentals. Extreme fear can lead to panic selling, creating potential buying opportunities for contrarian investors. Conversely, extreme greed often precedes market tops. The current ‘Fear’ phase suggests that many investors are reacting emotionally, which can lead to mispriced assets. However, it’s not a standalone trading signal. You must combine it with technical analysis and fundamental research. How Can You Use This Information Wisely? A low Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading is a call for caution, not necessarily inaction. Here are some actionable insights: Review Your Strategy : Is your portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance? Fearful markets test your long-term conviction. Avoid Emotional Decisions : The index highlights crowd psychology. Use it as a reminder to stick to your plan, not follow the herd. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) : For long-term believers, periods of fear can be a time to systematically accumulate assets at lower prices. Conduct Thorough Research : Look beyond sentiment. What are the on-chain metrics and project developments saying? Is This a Repeat of Past Crypto Winters? While a Crypto Fear & Greed Index of 26 evokes memories of deeper bear markets, context is key. Previous crypto winters saw the index plunge into single digits (‘Extreme Fear’). The current reading indicates significant worry but not yet the absolute despair seen at major bottoms. Market structure, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic factors are different today. Therefore, treat this as a valuable data point in a larger puzzle, not a definitive prophecy of a prolonged downturn. Conclusion: Navigating the Fear The drop in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 26 is a stark reminder that cryptocurrency markets are volatile and emotionally charged. It serves as a useful tool for gauging the market’s temperature and preventing you from making decisions based solely on hype or panic. The most successful investors often practice disciplined detachment, using tools like this index to understand the crowd, not join it. Remember, the transition from fear to greed is where significant opportunities are often born. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Who creates the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A: The index is provided by a company called Alternative.me. It has become a standard reference for sentiment in the crypto industry. Q: How often is the index updated? A: The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is updated daily, providing a near real-time pulse on market sentiment. Q: Is a ‘Fear’ reading always bad for prices? A: Not necessarily. While it often coincides with price declines, historically, prolonged periods of fear have sometimes marked accumulation zones before major rallies. Q: Should I sell all my crypto when the index shows ‘Fear’? A> No. The index is a sentiment indicator, not a direct trading signal. A fear reading could indicate a potential buying opportunity for long-term investors, depending on their strategy and risk assessment. Q: Does the index apply to all cryptocurrencies or just Bitcoin? A: While its components are heavily influenced by Bitcoin (like dominance and search volume), it is widely used as a proxy for overall cryptocurrency market sentiment. Q: Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index score? A> You can find it on the Alternative.me website or on many major cryptocurrency data and news platforms.

Crypto enthusiasts today are navigating a turbulent market where even big names like Bitcoin and Ethereum experience sudden dips and surges. According to recent news, Bitcoin price fell as much as 8% on Monday, dragging crypto-related stocks down, raising questions about a year-end rally despite expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut.

Bitcoin Takes a Tumble: Is the Year-End Rally at Risk? Bitcoin price dropped as much as 8% on Monday, shaking crypto markets and dragging down related stocks. This sudden dip has sparked doubts about a potential year-end rally, even as investors anticipate a Federal Reserve interest rate cut.

55323705,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=228281,1764814811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Bottom: Why Experts Warn It’s Too Early to Call the Market Floor,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-bottom-too-early-confirm/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Bottom: Why Experts Warn It’s Too Early to Call the Market Floor Is the Bitcoin bottom finally here? Many traders have been asking this question as cryptocurrency markets continue their volatile dance. However, prominent analyst Ted Pillows delivers a sobering message: it’s still too early to confirm a Bitcoin bottom. The market remains in a precarious position without clear support levels, creating what Pillows describes as a “high-risk, high-volatility phase” that demands careful navigation. Why Is It Too Early to Confirm a Bitcoin Bottom? According to Ted Pillows’ recent analysis on X, the cryptocurrency has failed to establish clear support after breaking through several key levels. The asset successively fell below $100,000, $95,000, and $90,000, wiping out initial optimism about a market floor. This pattern suggests that what some traders initially called a Bitcoin bottom might have been premature. Pillows emphasizes that Bitcoin currently trades in a directionless range without distinct upward momentum. The bearish trend that began on October 10 continues to influence market psychology, making it dangerous to assume we’ve reached the ultimate Bitcoin bottom. This uncertainty creates challenging conditions for both short-term traders and long-term investors. What Are the Key Warning Signs? Several factors indicate it might be premature to declare a definitive Bitcoin bottom. First, the lack of clear support levels means there’s no solid foundation for price recovery. When markets can’t find stable footing, they often experience continued volatility and potential further declines. Second, Pillows notes the absence of distinct upward momentum. A genuine market bottom typically shows signs of accumulation and gradual recovery, but current conditions suggest otherwise. The analyst highlights three critical observations: Broken support levels at $100K, $95K, and $90K Directionless trading range without clear trend High volatility increasing risk for all market participants How Should Traders Approach This Market? Given the uncertainty about whether we’ve reached a Bitcoin bottom, Pillows advises extreme caution. The current phase represents what seasoned traders call a “no man’s land” – a period where clear signals are scarce and false breakouts common. This environment requires different strategies than trending markets. Traders should consider several approaches during this uncertain period. First, reduce position sizes to manage risk effectively. Second, wait for clearer confirmation before making significant commitments. Third, focus on preserving capital rather than chasing uncertain opportunities. Remember, protecting your portfolio during uncertain times is often more important than maximizing gains during clear trends. What Could Signal a Real Bitcoin Bottom? While it’s too early to confirm a Bitcoin bottom currently, traders should watch for specific signals that might indicate a genuine market turn. These include the establishment of clear support levels that hold through multiple tests, increasing volume on upward moves, and improving market structure on longer timeframes. A true Bitcoin bottom typically forms with specific characteristics that differ from temporary pauses in a downtrend. Look for these potential signs: Sustained support at a specific price level Reduced volatility during declines Increasing buying pressure at lower levels Positive divergence in key technical indicators The Psychological Aspect of Market Bottoms Market bottoms involve more than just price action – they’re psychological events. When investors become excessively pessimistic and selling pressure exhausts itself, genuine bottoms can form. However, Pillows suggests we might not have reached this psychological extreme yet. The fact that some traders still believe we’ve found a Bitcoin bottom might actually indicate more pain could come. True market bottoms often arrive when few people are looking for them and when optimism has been thoroughly crushed. The current environment still shows pockets of hope and premature bottom-calling, suggesting the psychological reset might not be complete. This makes declaring a definitive Bitcoin bottom particularly risky at this juncture. Conclusion: Patience Over Premature Conclusions The search for a Bitcoin bottom continues, but according to Ted Pillows’ analysis, confirmation remains elusive. The market’s failure to establish clear support, combined with ongoing bearish trends and directionless trading, suggests caution is the wisest approach. While every trader wants to catch the exact bottom, history shows that waiting for confirmation typically produces better results than premature commitments. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, remember that sustainable bottoms build over time with clear technical and psychological signals. Until those signals appear, maintaining a defensive posture might be the most prudent strategy. The potential Bitcoin bottom will reveal itself through price action and market structure – not through hopeful predictions. Frequently Asked Questions What does “Bitcoin bottom” mean? A Bitcoin bottom refers to the lowest price point in a market cycle before prices begin a sustained upward movement. It represents the point where selling pressure exhausts itself and buying interest returns. Why is Ted Pillows saying it’s too early to confirm a bottom? Pillows points to several factors: Bitcoin has broken through multiple support levels without establishing new ones, trades in a directionless range, and shows no distinct upward momentum since the bearish trend began October 10. What price levels did Bitcoin break through recently? According to the analysis, Bitcoin successively broke below key support levels at $100,000, $95,000, and $90,000, eliminating what some traders initially thought might be a market floor. How should traders approach the current market? Pillows advises extreme caution, describing this as a high-risk, high-volatility phase. Traders should reduce position sizes, wait for clearer signals, and focus on capital preservation rather than aggressive positioning. What signals should I watch for a potential bottom? Look for established support levels that hold through multiple tests, increasing volume on upward moves, reduced volatility during declines, and positive divergence in technical indicators. How long do market bottoms typically take to form? Genuine market bottoms often develop over weeks or months, not days. They require both technical confirmation and psychological reset among market participants. Found this analysis helpful?

According to live data from Bitcoin World, Bitcoin is currently trading at $94,077.71 on the Binance USDT market. This remarkable rally is capturing the attention of investors worldwide and signaling a potentially powerful new phase for the flagship cryptocurrency. What’s Driving the Remarkable BTC Price Rally? The surge past $94,000 isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several key factors are converging to fuel this upward momentum. First, increasing institutional adoption is providing a solid foundation of demand. Moreover, recent macroeconomic developments, such as shifting monetary policy expectations, are making hard assets like Bitcoin more attractive to a broader audience. Therefore, this price movement reflects a growing consensus about Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. The market is responding to a combination of scarcity, utility, and its evolving role as a digital store of value. Key Levels and Market Sentiment for Bitcoin Breaking through the $94,000 level is a major psychological milestone. Traders often watch these round numbers closely. The current BTC price action suggests strong bullish sentiment, but what should investors watch next? Resistance and Support: The next key resistance level to watch is around $95,500. On the downside, $92,000 now acts as a crucial support zone. Trading Volume: Sustained high volume confirms the strength of this move and differentiates it from a short-lived spike. Market Dominance: Bitcoin’s rising dominance often leads the overall crypto market, setting the tone for altcoins. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors When the BTC price makes such a decisive move, it’s crucial to have a plan. Here are some practical considerations. First, avoid making decisions based solely on emotion or fear of missing out. A disciplined strategy is your best ally in a volatile market. Consider these steps: Review Your Portfolio: Ensure your allocation to Bitcoin aligns with your overall risk tolerance and investment goals. Dollar-Cost Average (DCA): If you are adding exposure, consider using a DCA strategy to mitigate timing risk. Secure Your Assets: Ensure your Bitcoin is stored securely in a non-custodial wallet if you are holding for the long term. The Road Ahead for the BTC Price While celebrating the current BTC price achievement is exciting, the future path remains dynamic. Key developments to monitor include regulatory clarity from major economies and the continued integration of Bitcoin into traditional finance. Furthermore, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event will continue to be a central narrative, reinforcing its scarcity. Ultimately, this surge above $94,000 reinforces Bitcoin’s resilience and its growing acceptance. However, investors should prepare for continued volatility as the market digests this rapid appreciation and searches for a new equilibrium.

It demonstrates the asset’s capacity for powerful growth and its increasing maturity within the global financial landscape. This BTC price movement is more than just a number; it’s a testament to the enduring belief in a decentralized financial future. For savvy investors, it’s a reminder of the importance of staying informed, staying secure, and focusing on long-term fundamentals amidst short-term price fluctuations.

The rally is driven by a combination of factors including increased institutional investment, positive macroeconomic shifts favoring hard assets, and growing mainstream adoption, all converging to create strong buying pressure. Is it too late to buy Bitcoin at $94,000? While timing the market is difficult, many investors use strategies like dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to build a position over time, regardless of price, focusing on long-term potential rather than short-term entry points.

In a major move blending sports, finance, and digital assets, sports merchandise giant Fanatics has teamed up with crypto exchange leader Crypto.com to launch Fanatics Markets . This new prediction market platform lets users trade on the outcomes of real-world events, marking a significant evolution in how we engage with sports and markets. What is the Fanatics and Crypto.com Prediction Market Platform? Simply put, a prediction market allows people to buy and sell “shares” in the outcome of future events. Think of it like a stock market for predictions. Fanatics Markets, powered by Crypto.com’s technology, is launching this concept to a massive audience. Initially, the platform focuses on events in four core areas: Sports: From game winners to player performance. Finance & Economics: Including interest rate decisions or inflation reports. Politics: Such as election results or policy outcomes. The platform is live starting today in 10 U.S. states, including California, Texas, and Florida, with a rapid app rollout planned for 24 states. Why is This Partnership a Big Deal? This collaboration is powerful because it merges two distinct worlds. Fanatics brings an unparalleled sports fanbase and brand trust, while Crypto.com contributes deep expertise in secure, high-volume digital trading. Together, they create a trusted and accessible prediction market platform . This move signals a growing mainstream acceptance of prediction markets, not as niche gambling tools, but as legitimate platforms for gauging collective intelligence and hedging opinions. What’s Next for Fanatics Markets? The initial launch is just the beginning. The companies have announced ambitious expansion plans for early next year. The prediction market platform is set to broaden its horizons significantly to include: Cryptocurrency price movements Stock market fluctuations Pop culture and entertainment events, including movies and awards shows This expansion could fundamentally change how fans interact with their passions, allowing them to financially engage with everything from a new album drop to a superhero movie’s opening weekend box office. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities? Launching a new prediction market platform in the U.S. is not without hurdles. The regulatory landscape for prediction markets is complex and varies by state, which explains the phased geographic rollout. However, the opportunity is immense. By starting with sports—a domain with a clear, established fanbase—Fanatics Markets can build user familiarity before introducing more complex financial and crypto-based predictions. This strategy could onboard millions to the concepts of decentralized finance and collective forecasting. Conclusion: A New Arena for Fan Engagement The launch of Fanatics Markets is more than a new app; it’s a glimpse into a future where fandom and financial participation merge. This prediction market platform democratizes access to trading on future events, turning every fan into a potential analyst. As it expands into crypto and stocks, it could become a major gateway for traditional sports enthusiasts to enter the digital asset space. The game is changing, and the playing field is now any event you can predict. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: How is a prediction market different from sports betting? A: While both involve predicting outcomes, prediction markets often focus on a wider range of events (like finance or politics) and function more like a trading exchange where prices fluctuate based on demand, rather than offering fixed odds. Q: Is the Fanatics Markets platform available everywhere? A: Not yet. It is currently available in 10 U.S. states, with plans to expand to 24 states via its mobile app in the coming days. Availability depends on local regulations. Q: Will I need cryptocurrency to use Fanatics Markets? A: Specific payment methods haven’t been fully detailed, but given Crypto.com’s involvement, it’s likely the platform will support both traditional and crypto payments. Q: What kind of crypto predictions will be available? A: While specifics are coming early next year, users can likely expect markets on major cryptocurrency price movements, adoption milestones, or protocol upgrade outcomes. Q: Is my money safe on this prediction market platform? A: The partnership with an established, regulated entity like Crypto.com suggests a strong focus on security and compliance, which should provide a layer of trust for users. Q: Can I use this for investment purposes? A> Prediction markets are primarily for trading on event outcomes. They can reflect market sentiment, but they carry high risk and should not be considered a traditional investment vehicle.

Imagine a one-year-old company with modest revenue securing a $415 million valuation through a $90 million Series A round. This isn’t fantasy—it’s the reality for DualEntry, an AI enterprise resource planning startup, and it represents a fundamental shift in how top-tier VCs are placing their bets. The strategy? Deploy massive capital early to create market winners through sheer financial force, a tactic known as ‘kingmaking.’ For cryptocurrency investors watching from the sidelines, this aggressive funding approach reveals how traditional venture capital is adapting to the AI revolution, creating both unprecedented opportunities and significant risks in the startup ecosystem. What Is the Kingmaking Strategy in Venture Capital? The kingmaking strategy involves venture capital firms deploying unusually large funding rounds into selected startups at early stages, aiming to overwhelm competitors by creating an insurmountable bank-account advantage. This approach isn’t entirely new—what’s changed is the timing. Jeremy Kaufmann, a partner at Scale Venture Partners, explains: ‘Venture capitalists have always evaluated competitors and bet on who they think will win a category. What’s different is that it’s happening much earlier.’ Consider these key characteristics of kingmaking: Early Stage Deployment: Massive funding at Series A or B rounds rather than later stages Category Selection: Focus on AI application categories with clear market potential Valuation Disconnect: Funding amounts that far exceed traditional revenue multiples Competitive Pressure: Designed to create market dominance through financial superiority AI Startups: The Primary Targets of Kingmaking The AI startup landscape has become the primary battleground for this strategy. DualEntry’s $90 million Series A at a $415 million valuation, despite reportedly having annual recurring revenue around $400,000, exemplifies this trend. The company’s co-founder, Nestares, disputes that revenue figure, stating it was ‘considerably higher’ when the deal closed, but even optimistic estimates show a significant valuation-to-revenue multiple. This pattern extends beyond DualEntry. The AI ERP category has seen multiple startups raising substantial back-to-back rounds: Company Funding Round Amount Timeline Rillet Series B $70 million August 2025 Rillet Series A $25 million June 2025 Campfire AI Series B $65 million October 2025 Campfire AI Series A $35 million August 2025 Jaya Gupta, a partner at Foundation Capital, noted on X: ‘There’s no new data between rounds. Series Bs happen 27-60 days after Series As regularly.’ This rapid succession funding occurs across multiple AI application categories, including IT service management and SOC compliance. How Early Funding Creates Market Advantages Why would venture capital firms deploy such substantial capital to early-stage companies with limited revenue? The strategy offers several potential advantages that extend beyond traditional growth funding: Market Perception: Well-funded startups appear more stable to enterprise buyers, making them preferred vendors for significant software purchases Talent Acquisition: Substantial funding allows startups to attract top engineering and executive talent Customer Confidence: Large war chests signal long-term viability, crucial for enterprise sales cycles Competitive Barrier: The financial advantage can deter competitors and potential market entrants David Peterson, partner at Angular Ventures, contrasts this with previous cycles: ‘The 2010s version of this was just called ‘capital as a weapon.’ He points to Uber and Lyft as canonical examples, but notes that for those companies, ‘the capital weaponization didn’t begin until they reached their Series C or D rounds.’ The Risks and Rewards of Kingmaking for ERP Software The kingmaking strategy carries significant risks alongside its potential rewards. For ERP software startups specifically, the approach creates both opportunities and challenges: Potential Benefits: Accelerated market penetration against established players like Oracle NetSuite Ability to invest heavily in product development and customer acquisition Enhanced credibility with enterprise customers wary of startup stability Significant Risks: Valuation bubbles that may collapse if growth expectations aren’t met Pressure to justify massive valuations with rapid revenue growth Potential for market consolidation that leaves few survivors History offers cautionary tales. Notable failures like logistics company Convoy and the bankruptcy reorganization of scooter company Bird demonstrate that massive capitalization offers no guarantee of success. Yet major VC firms continue this approach, driven by what Peterson describes as the ‘fully internalized lesson of the power law.’ Why Venture Capital Firms Embrace This High-Stakes Approach Despite the risks, several factors drive venture capital firms toward kingmaking strategies in AI sectors: Market Timing: AI represents a transformative technology shift comparable to mobile or cloud computing Competitive Dynamics: Multiple well-funded startups in the same category create winner-take-most dynamics FOMO Psychology: Fear of missing out on the next Uber or Airbnb of AI Portfolio Strategy: Willingness to accept high failure rates for potential outsized returns As one VC who declined to invest in DualEntry told Bitcoin World, the disconnect between valuation and revenue has become increasingly common. This reflects a broader shift in how venture capital evaluates early-stage opportunities in transformative technology categories. FAQs: Understanding the Kingmaking Phenomenon What companies are using the kingmaking strategy? Several venture capital firms are employing this approach, including Lightspeed Venture Partners , Khosla Ventures , Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) , and Sequoia Capital . These firms are backing AI startups like DualEntry , Rillet, and Campfire AI with unusually large early-stage rounds. Who are the key people mentioned in this strategy? Key figures include Jeremy Kaufmann of Scale Venture Partners , David Peterson of Angular Ventures , and Jaya Gupta of Foundation Capital . These investors have observed and participated in the shifting funding patterns. How does this affect the broader AI startup ecosystem? The kingmaking strategy creates both opportunities and challenges. It provides selected startups with resources to accelerate growth but may create valuation bubbles and increase competitive pressure on unfunded or underfunded competitors. What historical precedents exist for this approach? Previous examples include the ridesharing wars between Uber and Lyft , where massive late-stage funding created competitive advantages. The key difference today is how early in company development this strategy is being deployed. Are there successful examples of kingmaking? While it’s too early to judge current AI startups, historical examples like Uber demonstrate how substantial funding can create market dominance. However, failures like Convoy and Bird show the risks of overcapitalization without sustainable business models. Conclusion: The Future of Venture Capital in the AI Era The kingmaking strategy represents a fundamental evolution in how venture capital approaches transformative technology opportunities. By deploying massive funding at earlier stages, VCs aim to create market winners through financial force rather than organic growth. This approach carries significant risks—including potential valuation bubbles and high-profile failures—but reflects the venture community’s belief in AI’s transformative potential and the lessons learned from previous technology cycles. For cryptocurrency investors and observers, this trend offers insights into how traditional venture capital is adapting to rapid technological change. The aggressive funding of AI startups parallels certain patterns seen in crypto venture investing, though with different risk profiles and market dynamics. As AI continues to reshape enterprise software and other sectors, the kingmaking strategy will likely produce both spectacular successes and notable failures, ultimately testing whether early financial advantage can reliably create lasting market leadership.

The platform has announced essential Bitcoin World system maintenance scheduled for December 3rd. This temporary service pause represents a commitment to improvement, not an interruption. Let’s explore what this means for you and why it matters for your cryptocurrency journey. When is the Bitcoin World system maintenance happening? The Bitcoin World system maintenance window is clearly defined to minimize user disruption. The team will conduct this essential work from 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. UTC on December 3 . This two-hour period is strategically chosen during lower global traffic hours. Therefore, the impact on most users should be minimal. The platform apologizes for any inconvenience and emphasizes that this work will lead to an improved service experience. What services will be unavailable during the maintenance? Understanding the scope of the outage helps you plan accordingly. During the Bitcoin World system maintenance period, one core service will be temporarily suspended. Real-time Investment Information Services: All live price feeds, market data updates, and real-time analytics will be paused. However, it’s crucial to note what will not be affected. User accounts, historical data, and the main website infrastructure will remain accessible. This targeted approach shows the maintenance is a focused upgrade, not a full platform shutdown. Why is this Bitcoin World maintenance necessary? Regular maintenance is the backbone of any reliable digital platform. For a service like Bitcoin World, which handles volatile, real-time financial data, these updates are non-negotiable. This Bitcoin World system maintenance likely aims to implement backend improvements that users will benefit from later. These upgrades can include: Enhanced Server Infrastructure: For faster data processing and reduced latency. Security Patches: To protect user data and ensure platform integrity. New Feature Integration: Laying the groundwork for future tools and analytics. Proactive maintenance prevents unexpected downtime and builds a more robust service, ultimately protecting your access to critical information. How should you prepare as a user?

Plan Your Research: If you need live data for analysis, complete it before 8:00 PM UTC on Dec 3. Use Alternative Sources Temporarily: Bookmark other reputable crypto data sites to check prices during the short window if absolutely necessary. Set Price Alerts Elsewhere: For active traders, set up alerts on your exchange or wallet app for the maintenance period. Remember, this is a brief, scheduled pause. The long-term benefit of a more stable and feature-rich Bitcoin World platform far outweighs this short-term inconvenience. What can you expect after the maintenance? The promise of an “improved service” is the key takeaway. Once the Bitcoin World system maintenance is complete, you should return to a platform that is faster, more secure, and potentially more feature-rich. Look for subtle improvements in page load times, data refresh rates, and overall platform stability. These behind-the-scenes upgrades are what allow trusted crypto information hubs to remain reliable in a fast-paced market. Conclusion: A Necessary Step Forward The scheduled Bitcoin World system maintenance on December 3rd is a sign of a healthy, evolving platform. It demonstrates a commitment to technical excellence and user experience.

According to real-time data from Binance’s USDT trading pair, BTC is currently trading at $93,012.08. This significant milestone marks a pivotal moment for investors and signals renewed bullish momentum in the market. But what’s fueling this impressive Bitcoin price surge , and is this rally built to last? What’s Driving the Current Bitcoin Price Surge? Several key factors often converge to create such powerful upward movements. First, increased institutional adoption continues to provide a solid foundation of demand. Major financial firms are not just holding Bitcoin but actively integrating it into their investment products. Secondly, macroeconomic conditions, such as concerns about inflation or currency devaluation, can drive investors towards Bitcoin as a perceived store of value. Finally, market sentiment and technical breakthroughs, like surpassing a major resistance level, can trigger a wave of buying from both retail and algorithmic traders. Breaking Down the $93,000 Milestone Crossing the $93,000 mark is more than just a number; it’s a strong psychological signal. This level often acts as a key resistance point. When Bitcoin breaks above it with conviction, as seen in the current trading data, it suggests that buying pressure is overwhelming selling pressure. For traders, this can indicate a potential continuation of the trend. However, it’s crucial to remember that cryptocurrency markets are volatile. Key levels to watch now include: Support: The previous resistance near $90,000 may now act as a new support zone. Resistance: The next major psychological hurdle is likely the $95,000 or even $100,000 level. Volume: Sustained high trading volume confirms the strength of the move. How Should Investors Navigate This Rally? While a major Bitcoin price surge is exciting, it requires a strategic approach. For long-term holders, this may reinforce their conviction, but they should avoid making emotional decisions based on short-term spikes. For active traders, understanding market structure and having a clear risk management plan is non-negotiable. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and consider using tools like stop-loss orders to protect your capital. Diversification across different asset classes, even within crypto, remains a cornerstone of prudent investing. The Bigger Picture: What Does This Mean for Crypto? Bitcoin often acts as a bellwether for the broader digital asset ecosystem. A strong Bitcoin price surge typically generates positive sentiment that can spill over into altcoins. This can lead to increased trading activity and development across the entire space. Furthermore, such prominent price action attracts media attention, potentially drawing new users and capital into the cryptocurrency market. It validates the growing narrative of Bitcoin as a mature financial asset class. In conclusion, Bitcoin’s ascent above $93,000 is a testament to its enduring resilience and growing adoption. This Bitcoin price surge highlights the asset’s potential for significant growth, driven by a complex mix of institutional interest, macroeconomic factors, and market dynamics. While the journey will undoubtedly include volatility, this milestone reinforces Bitcoin’s position at the forefront of the financial revolution. The key for participants is to stay informed, manage risk diligently, and focus on the long-term technological transformation rather than daily price fluctuations. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why did Bitcoin suddenly rise above $93,000? A: Price movements are rarely due to a single cause. This surge is likely a combination of positive institutional news flows, favorable macroeconomic signals, and technical buying pressure after breaking key resistance levels. Q2: Is it too late to buy Bitcoin after this surge? A: “Timing the market” is extremely difficult. Many investors use a strategy called dollar-cost averaging (DCA), investing a fixed amount regularly regardless of price, to mitigate the risk of buying at a peak. Q3: Could the price drop back down just as quickly? A> Yes, cryptocurrency is known for its volatility. Sharp rallies can be followed by corrections. This is why risk management and a long-term perspective are essential. Q4: Does Bitcoin’s rise mean altcoins will also go up? A: Often, but not always. A strong Bitcoin can lift the entire market, but each altcoin has its own fundamentals. This period is sometimes called “altcoin season” if capital rotates from Bitcoin into smaller-cap assets. Q5: Where can I safely track the Bitcoin price? A> Reputable cryptocurrency data aggregators and major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken provide real-time price information. Always use trusted sources. Q6: What’s the next major target if Bitcoin holds above $93,000? A: The next significant psychological and technical resistance levels are widely seen at $95,000 and the historic $100,000 mark, which would be a monumental achievement for the network.

The Franklin Templeton SOL ETF has officially begun trading on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol SOEZ. This isn’t just another fund launch; it’s a powerful validation of Solana’s blockchain technology and a clear signal that institutional demand for crypto exposure is moving beyond Bitcoin. For investors, this moment unlocks a familiar, regulated pathway to gain exposure to one of cryptocurrency’s most dynamic assets. What Does the Franklin Templeton SOL ETF Mean for Investors? The launch of the Franklin Templeton SOL ETF represents a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset world. Franklin Templeton, a global investment giant with over $1.6 trillion in assets, is providing a crucial service: regulated, accessible exposure to Solana’s native token, SOL. Therefore, investors no longer need to navigate crypto exchanges or manage private keys. Instead, they can buy and sell shares of SOEZ through their standard brokerage accounts, just like they would with any stock or traditional ETF. This move significantly de-risks the process for mainstream and institutional players. Key benefits include: Regulatory Oversight: The ETF operates within the established U.S. regulatory framework, offering a layer of security and compliance unfamiliar to direct crypto holdings. Custody & Security: Franklin Templeton handles the complex custody of the underlying SOL assets, mitigating the risk of theft or loss that individuals face. Tax Simplicity: Investments are integrated into existing tax reporting structures, simplifying the often-confusing crypto tax landscape. Liquidity & Accessibility: Trading on the NYSE Arca ensures high liquidity and makes the fund available to a vast pool of retail and institutional investors. Why Is This Launch a Game-Changer for Solana? Beyond investor convenience, the approval and listing of the Franklin Templeton SOL ETF serve as a monumental endorsement for the Solana network itself. Regulatory bodies do not greenlight products tied to assets they deem unsecure or fraudulent. This launch, therefore, signals a growing institutional confidence in Solana’s underlying technology, its developer ecosystem, and its long-term viability. Moreover, it creates a powerful, circular flywheel effect. Increased investment through the ETF can boost SOL’s market profile and liquidity. This, in turn, can attract more developers and projects to build on Solana, enhancing its utility and value. The ETF acts as a formal on-ramp for billions in traditional capital that has been waiting for a secure entry point. What Challenges and Considerations Should You Know? While this is a landmark achievement, savvy investors should approach with clear eyes. First, this is a spot ETF, meaning it directly holds SOL, but it’s crucial to understand the associated fees and structure, which Franklin Templeton will disclose. Second, investing in a single-asset crypto ETF like SOEZ carries concentrated risk. Your investment’s performance is tied directly to SOL’s price movements, which can be highly volatile compared to a diversified portfolio. Furthermore, the crypto regulatory environment remains in flux. While this ETF’s approval is positive, broader regulations could impact the sector. Always consider your own risk tolerance and conduct thorough research, viewing crypto exposure as a strategic portion of a broader investment plan rather than a core holding. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Crypto Adoption The debut of the Franklin Templeton SOL ETF on the NYSE Arca is more than a new ticker symbol. It is a definitive step toward the maturation and institutionalization of the cryptocurrency market. By offering a familiar, regulated vehicle, Franklin Templeton has effectively lowered the barrier for millions to participate in Solana’s growth story. This launch validates the asset, educates the mainstream, and paves the way for the next wave of financial innovation. The gates are now officially open. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the ticker symbol for the Franklin Templeton SOL ETF? The ETF trades on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol SOEZ . How is this different from buying SOL directly on a crypto exchange? Buying the ETF through a brokerage account means you own shares in a fund that holds SOL, not the cryptocurrency itself. You avoid the complexities of digital wallets, private keys, and crypto-native exchanges. Does this ETF pay dividends? Typically, spot cryptocurrency ETFs do not pay dividends as the underlying assets (like SOL) do not generate dividend income. Any returns are based on changes in the NAV (Net Asset Value) of the fund. What are the risks of investing in the SOL ETF? The primary risks mirror those of holding SOL directly: high price volatility, regulatory changes impacting crypto, and technology risks associated with the Solana blockchain. The ETF itself also charges a management fee. Can I hold this ETF in my IRA or 401(k)? Yes, since it trades on a major stock exchange, shares of the SOEZ ETF can typically be held in traditional retirement accounts, depending on your plan’s specific rules. Is this the first Solana ETF? In the United States, this is among the first spot Solana ETFs to receive regulatory approval and list on a major national exchange, marking a significant first.

On one side, meme-coins, often subject to fleeting hype cycles and sudden crashes, see confidence erode after repeated sell-offs. On the other, a structured sector is attracting capital and attention in a growing manner: that of tokenized real-world assets (RWA). This is not a passing trend. It is a reallocation of capital toward projects with economic fundamentals, verifiable cash flows, and a clear business model. In this context, a proposal like RentStac (RNS) does not promise fortunes based on a viral tweet but builds an investment thesis on a solid pillar: the global rental real estate market. The Context: Why Capital is Changing Course Investors, especially after recent turbulence, show fatigue with pure speculation. They seek resilience. The answer comes from RWA models, which anchor a token’s value to physical assets and existing income contracts. The entry of giants like BlackRock and central banks’ experimentation with digital bonds are powerful signals of validation for the entire category. While meme-coins live and die with market sentiment, RWA projects operate on a different time horizon. Their value is tied to the performance of a real asset, its ability to generate revenue, and the transparency with which it is distributed. It’s a paradigm shift: from betting to investing. RentStac (RNS): A Concrete Model, Not a Slogan RentStac embodies precisely this paradigm shift. It is not based on a community waiting for a “pump,” but on a transparent and replicable operational mechanism. Here’s how it works, according to its public documentation: Real Legal Ownership: Each property is held by a dedicated Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV). The SPV holds the legal title, offering clear legal separation between the asset and the platform. Fractional and Democratized Ownership: Rights to the SPV are tokenized. This allows anyone, with a few hundred dollars, to own a fraction of a residential or commercial property, an asset traditionally reserved for large capital. Automated Cash Flow: Smart contracts manage the collection of rental payments and their proportional redistribution to token holders. The investor does not have to trust promises but can verify the flows on the blockchain. Defined Roles: The system recognizes three figures: the Investor (the token owner), the Manager (who handles the operational management of the property), and the Validator (who ensures the integrity of on-chain operations). This is not an abstract idea, but a practical application of blockchain to solve a real problem: the illiquid, high-minimum-capital access to the real estate market. What Investors Are Looking for Today (And What They Find Here) After the experience with purely speculative assets, the market demand is clear: Transparency: Where does my money go? With RentStac, the asset is identifiable and the income stream is traceable on-chain. Fundamentals: What supports the value of this token? Not the next influencer, but the lease contracts of real properties. Passive Cash Flow: Can I generate yield without having to sell the asset? The model is designed precisely to distribute rental income. Protection from Extreme Volatility: While the token price may fluctuate, its intrinsic value is anchored to an asset whose price does not go to zero overnight. RentStac responds directly to these needs. It does not promise to “go to the moon” overnight but to build a path of value over time, brick by brick. The RNS Presale: An Early Entry Opportunity The project has initiated a public presale for its native token, RNS (total supply: 2 billion), at a price of $0.025 USD . This phase allows entry into the project before its debut on major exchanges, a traditionally catalytic moment for visibility and liquidity. An investment at this stage is not a bet on a meme but an early-stage participation in infrastructure aiming to democratize a multi-trillion dollar market. It is a calculation based on the future adoption of the model, the growth of the real estate portfolio, and the demand for real, stable yields in the crypto world. Conclusion: Beyond the Noise, Toward Substance The market is maturing. The phase where any token with a dog as a mascote could soar is giving way to a more sober evaluation of value propositions. While meme-coins sink under the weight of their lack of substance, the real opportunity for 2026 and beyond is crystallizing around protocols that do the heavy lifting: integrating the real world into the blockchain, creating utility, efficiency, and, above all, real and sustainable profit opportunities. RentStac (RNS) is not just another token in a sea of proposals. It is a concrete example of where the future of digital finance is headed: toward assets that not only have a market price but also generate income. For the investor seeking substance beyond the noise, delving into this project may not only be interesting but necessary.

According to a stunning new report from financial titan BlackRock, that future is closer than you think. The world’s largest asset manager has made a bold prediction: we will see accelerated Bitcoin adoption by 2026, driven by profound shifts in the global economic landscape. This isn’t just speculation from crypto enthusiasts; it’s a forecast from a $10 trillion institution that shapes global markets. Why Does BlackRock Predict Accelerated Bitcoin Adoption? BlackRock’s 2026 outlook points directly to two massive, interconnected forces: growing U.S. economic vulnerability and a federal debt expected to surpass $38 trillion. The firm suggests that these traditional financial pressures will push investors and institutions toward alternative stores of value. Therefore, digital assets like Bitcoin are poised to move from the fringe to the financial mainstream. This projection signals a fundamental change in how major players view cryptocurrency—not as a speculative toy, but as a necessary component of a modern portfolio. The Driving Forces Behind the Shift What specific factors are catalyzing this change? BlackRock’s analysis highlights a perfect storm. Mounting Sovereign Debt: The staggering $38 trillion U.S. debt figure creates concerns about currency devaluation and inflation, making hard-capped assets like Bitcoin more attractive. Institutional Infrastructure: The approval of Bitcoin ETFs, which BlackRock itself spearheaded, has created a regulated, familiar pathway for massive capital inflows. Technological Maturation: The underlying blockchain technology has proven resilient and secure over more than a decade, building trust. Consequently, the narrative is shifting from “if” to “when and how” for widespread Bitcoin adoption . Beyond Bitcoin: Tokenization and Stablecoins as New Infrastructure BlackRock’s vision extends far beyond just Bitcoin. The report emphasizes that tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) and the rise of stablecoins will act as the critical plumbing connecting old and new financial systems. Think of tokenization as creating a digital twin for assets like bonds, real estate, or even art on a blockchain. Stablecoins, meanwhile, offer the price stability of fiat currency with the efficiency of digital transactions. Together, they form the key infrastructure that will allow traditional finance (TradFi) to seamlessly interact with the digital economy (DeFi). What Are the Practical Implications for Investors? For the average person, this forecast is more than just news—it’s a roadmap. Here are actionable insights: Education is Key: Understanding the basics of blockchain, wallets, and custody solutions is no longer optional for informed investing. Portfolio Diversification: Consider how a small, strategic allocation to digital assets might hedge against traditional market risks highlighted by BlackRock. Watch the Bridges: Pay attention to companies and projects working on tokenization and regulatory-compliant stablecoins, as they will be the enablers of this transition. However, challenges remain. Regulatory clarity, security concerns, and market volatility are significant hurdles that must be navigated for this prediction to fully materialize. The Final Verdict on Bitcoin’s Mainstream March BlackRock’s 2026 outlook is a powerful endorsement of the digital asset revolution. It reframes Bitcoin adoption not as a niche trend but as a probable response to macroeconomic fragility. By linking the move to concrete issues like national debt and identifying tokenization as the bridge, the report provides a coherent, institution-grade thesis for crypto’s future. While the path may have twists, the direction is clear: the integration of digital assets into the global financial system is accelerating. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly did BlackRock predict about Bitcoin? A1: BlackRock stated in its 2026 outlook that digital assets like Bitcoin will see wider, accelerated adoption, primarily due to concerns over U.S. economic vulnerability and its soaring national debt. Q2: Why does U.S. debt influence Bitcoin adoption? A2: High national debt can lead to fears of currency devaluation or inflation. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply of 21 million coins, is seen by many as a potential hedge against these traditional financial risks. Q3: What role do stablecoins and tokenization play? A3: BlackRock projects they will become key infrastructure. Stablecoins offer digital dollar stability for transactions, while tokenization turns real-world assets into digital tokens on a blockchain, creating a bridge between traditional and digital finance. Q4: Is BlackRock’s prediction a guarantee? A4: No, it is a forecast based on current trends. It remains subject to factors like regulatory changes, technological developments, and broader market acceptance. Q5: How can an individual prepare for this potential shift? A5: Focus on education, understand the risks and technology, and consider how digital assets might fit into a long-term, diversified investment strategy after consulting with a financial advisor. Q6: Does this mean Bitcoin will replace traditional money? A6> Not in the near term. BlackRock’s vision is one of coexistence and integration, where Bitcoin acts as a complementary asset class and blockchain technology improves the efficiency of the existing financial system.

Le framed Strategy’s balance sheet as a barbell between long-term BTC exposure and short-term cash obligations: “We have long-term strategy, which is to buy and hold bitcoin. That is our primary treasury reserve asset . And we have short-term dollar obligations created because of the dividends we have on our preferred notes.” To avoid being forced to sell BTC when the company’s equity trades close to or below the value of its underlying holdings, Strategy created a dedicated US dollar reserve: “If we want to really create a bulletproof balance sheet, let’s have the global reserve digital asset, bitcoin, for the long term, and the global reserve digital currency for the short term. That is why I created the US dollar reserve, to pay down dividends in the short term any case that we needed.” Le said Strategy recently issued equity “in 8.5 days” to pre-fund roughly 21 months of preferred dividends, and now aims to maintain a cash buffer equal to “two to three years of dividends,” a policy he expects to maintain for “the next five or 10 years” before reassessing as the capital structure evolves. He defended the company’s insistence on continuing the dividend, arguing that suspensions “create fear, uncertainty, doubt” and harm equity holders: “Our objective is to pay the dividend into perpetuity. Never say never, but I think preserving the payment of the dividend is the right thing for the short term. It is also important for the bitcoin asset class.” At the same time, he sought to defuse concerns that Strategy is overleveraged or at imminent risk of selling BTC. Le said Strategy has “12% leverage” on its debt alone and “27% leverage” including preferreds, versus “60% to 80%” at a typical US public company. If the company continues to grow its cash reserves to cover multiple years of dividends, he said, “really [we’re] talking about the end of 2028” before any realistic scenario where selling bitcoin to fund dividends might be considered. Le also pushed back against MSCI’s suggestion that “digital asset treasury” companies may resemble funds and could be excluded from indices. He argued Strategy is a “fully integrated, vertically integrated bitcoin operating company” that buys bitcoin, issues securities, creates products, generates operating income and employs full corporate staff, and therefore should trade at a premium reflecting its ability “to grow our treasury and our operating income over time.” From HODL To Considering Bitcoin Lending On lending, Le said Strategy has deliberately kept its business “very simple” so far: “We buy and we hold bitcoin.”However, that may change as traditional finance ramps up BTC offerings: “Over the course of the next year […] big, real banks will offer custody, lending service and staking and otherwise. I think when they enter that space and when they have different counterparties, it is something we would consider and be enthusiastic about.” Le added that Strategy has already had “a lot of constructive discussions” with large US banks exploring bitcoin custody, exchange and lending and is “excited to partner with them” once those platforms are fully in place.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Trail Ends: $29M Seized After European Authorities Shut Down Cryptomixer Average daily wipeouts have jumped from roughly $28 million in long bets and $15 million in shorts during the last cycle to about $68 million long and $45 million short in the current cycle, according to a new Glassnode and Fasanara report. That shift has made single sell-offs much more violent. Early Black Friday Shock Reports have disclosed that Oct. 10 was the clearest sign of the change. On that day, more than $640 million per hour in long positions were liquidated as Bitcoin plunged from $121,000 to $102,000. Open interest fell about 22% in less than 12 hours, sliding from close to $50 billion to $39 billion. Traders felt the move fast. Positions were closed out on a scale Glassnode called one of the sharpest deleveraging events in Bitcoin’s history. Futures Activity Hits Records Futures markets have swelled. Open interest climbed to a record $68 billion and daily futures turnover topped $69 billion in mid-October. Perpetual contracts now account for more than 90% of that activity, which concentrates risk in instruments that reset continuously. Average daily futures wipeouts rising to $68 million long and $45 million short shows the costs when big swings occur. Spot Trading Doubles Based on reports, spot trading has also become more active. Bitcoin’s spot volume has climbed into an $8 billion to $22 billion daily range, roughly double what was seen in the prior cycle. During the Oct. 10 crash, hourly spot volume spiked to $7.3 billion, with many traders stepping in to buy the dip rather than run for the exits. That flow has helped shift where price discovery happens. Capital Flows And Market Share Monthly inflows into Bitcoin have varied from $40 billion to $190 billion, pushing realized market capitalization to a record $1.1 trillion. Roughly $730 billion has flowed into the network since the November 2022 low — more than all previous cycles combined. As a result, Bitcoin’s share of overall crypto market cap rose from 38% in late 2022 to 58% today, based on the report’s figures.

That throughput exceeded what major card networks handled in the same window. This has been cited as a reason some participants view Bitcoin not just as a store of value, but as an increasingly important settlement rail.

This latest failure marks a crucial moment in the ongoing battle between federal preemption and state-level innovation in technology governance. For those following regulatory trends that could impact blockchain and AI integration, this decision signals continued complexity in the legal landscape. What Happened with the Latest AI Regulation Block Attempt? The most recent effort to insert a ban on state AI regulation into the annual defense bill has been rejected after facing bipartisan opposition. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise confirmed that Republican leaders would seek “other places” to include the measure, which has received support from President Trump. This marks the second failure this year for such proposals, following a similar defeat when GOP lawmakers tried to include a 10-year moratorium on state AI laws in Trump’s tax and spending bill earlier in 2025. Why Does AI Regulation Matter for Technology Innovation? The debate over AI regulation centers on competing visions for technological governance. Silicon Valley companies and their supporters argue that allowing states to create their own AI regulations would result in: A confusing patchwork of rules across different jurisdictions Increased compliance costs for technology companies Potential stifling of innovation through inconsistent requirements Competitive disadvantages for companies operating in multiple states However, critics of federal preemption point out that most state AI legislation focuses on essential protections: State Focus Areas Federal Gap Consumer safety standards No comprehensive federal AI safety framework Algorithmic transparency requirements Limited federal disclosure mandates Bias prevention measures Inconsistent federal enforcement Industry-specific regulations One-size-fits-all federal approach The Political Battle Over Federal AI Policy The rejection of this provision reveals interesting political dynamics. Despite President Trump’s support for blocking state AI regulation, the measure faced resistance from both parties. Scalise acknowledged that the defense bill was not the appropriate vehicle for such a provision and echoed Trump’s previous calls to introduce the ban as separate legislation. This political maneuvering suggests that while there may be executive branch support for limiting state authority, legislative consensus remains elusive. What Government Oversight Means for AI Development The debate extends beyond simple regulatory preferences to fundamental questions about government oversight in emerging technologies. Proponents of state regulation argue that in the absence of comprehensive federal AI laws, blocking states from acting would effectively hand control to large technology companies without meaningful oversight. This concern resonates particularly in the cryptocurrency space, where similar debates about regulation versus innovation have played out for years. Future Implications for Tech Legislation The failure of this latest attempt suggests several possible developments: Separate Legislation: As Scalise indicated, supporters may pursue standalone bills rather than attaching provisions to unrelated legislation Executive Action: A leaked draft executive order suggests Trump is considering unilateral action, though these efforts have reportedly paused State Momentum: The rejection may embolden states to continue developing their own AI regulatory frameworks Industry Adaptation: Technology companies may need to prepare for diverse regulatory environments across states Actionable Insights for Technology Stakeholders For cryptocurrency projects, blockchain companies, and AI developers, this regulatory landscape offers important lessons: Monitor State Developments: Pay attention to AI regulation proposals in key technology states like California, New York, and Texas Engage in Policy Discussions: Participate in legislative processes at both state and federal levels Build Flexible Systems: Design technology architectures that can adapt to varying regulatory requirements Consider Compliance Early: Integrate regulatory considerations into product development from the beginning FAQs About the AI Regulation Battle Who is leading the effort to block state AI regulation? House Majority Leader Steve Scalise has been spearheading the legislative efforts, with support from President Donald Trump and backing from major Silicon Valley technology companies. What arguments do Silicon Valley companies make against state AI regulation? Companies like those represented by TechNet and other industry groups argue that multiple state regulations create compliance complexity that hinders innovation and gives advantage to larger companies with more legal resources. How might this affect cryptocurrency and blockchain projects? Many blockchain projects incorporate AI elements, and the regulatory uncertainty could impact development timelines, funding decisions, and geographic deployment strategies for these technologies. What happens next in the legislative process? Supporters may introduce standalone legislation, pursue other legislative vehicles, or wait for potential executive action from the Trump administration. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Technology Governance The failure to block state AI regulation represents more than just a legislative setback for certain interests. It signals a broader recognition that emerging technologies require thoughtful, multi-layered governance approaches. As with cryptocurrency regulation, the path forward for AI will likely involve both federal frameworks and state-level experimentation. This balanced approach, while complex, may ultimately produce more resilient and responsive regulatory systems that protect consumers while fostering innovation. The coming months will be crucial as both sides regroup and consider their next moves. For technology companies and observers, this ongoing battle offers valuable insights into how regulatory landscapes evolve for transformative technologies.

According to live data from Binance’s USDT trading pair, BTC is currently changing hands at approximately $91,973.74. This sudden move has sent ripples through the investor community, prompting urgent questions about the market’s near-term direction. Let’s break down what’s happening and why it matters for your portfolio. What Caused the Sudden Bitcoin Price Drop? Market analysts point to a confluence of factors driving this downward pressure. First, a wave of profit-taking emerged after Bitcoin’s recent rally failed to decisively break above the $94,000 resistance zone. Furthermore, broader macroeconomic concerns are resurfacing. Traders are nervously eyeing upcoming economic data and potential shifts in monetary policy, which traditionally impact risk assets like cryptocurrency. Therefore, this Bitcoin price action may reflect a classic “risk-off” sentiment seeping into digital asset markets. Is This a Normal Market Correction? Absolutely. Volatility is an inherent feature of cryptocurrency markets. Periodic corrections are healthy and necessary, even in strong bullish trends. They shake out weak hands and establish stronger support levels for the next leg up. Consider these key aspects of a typical correction: Liquidity Shifts: Money often rotates from major coins like Bitcoin into altcoins during pullbacks. Derivative Market Impact: A cascade of liquidations in leveraged futures positions can exaggerate price moves. Technical Reset: Pullbacks help the market cool off from overbought conditions, as indicated by metrics like the Relative Strength Index (RSI). This current Bitcoin price movement fits the pattern of a standard, if sharp, market correction. Key Levels to Watch After the Decline For traders, the immediate focus shifts to key support and resistance zones. The break below $92,000 is significant, but the next major support lies near the $90,000 psychological level and the 50-day moving average, which many institutions monitor closely. On the upside, the market must reclaim $92,500 to signal a potential recovery. Monitoring trading volume is also crucial; a drop on low volume suggests a lack of strong selling conviction, while high volume indicates a more decisive bearish move. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors How should you respond to this Bitcoin price volatility? First, avoid panic selling. Emotional decisions often lead to realized losses. Instead, review your investment thesis. Has the long-term outlook for Bitcoin changed, or is this short-term noise? For long-term holders, this may present a strategic dollar-cost averaging opportunity. For active traders, defining clear risk parameters is essential. Set stop-losses and have a plan for both bullish and bearish scenarios. Remember, successful investing is about discipline, not predicting every market twist. Conclusion: Navigating the Volatility The drop in the Bitcoin price below $92,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the crypto market’s dynamic nature. While concerning in the short term, such movements are part of the asset class’s fabric. The fundamental drivers for Bitcoin—digital scarcity, institutional adoption, and its role as a hedge against inflation—remain intact. By understanding the technical and sentiment-driven reasons behind the drop, investors can make informed decisions rather than reactive ones. The path forward requires patience and a focus on the broader trend, not just daily price fluctuations. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How low could the Bitcoin price go after breaking $92,000? A: While predictions are uncertain, traders are watching the $90,000 level as immediate support. A break below that could see a test of the $88,000-$87,000 range, which was a previous consolidation zone. Q2: Should I buy more Bitcoin now that the price has dropped? A: This depends on your investment strategy and risk tolerance. For long-term investors, a lower price can be an opportunity to average down. However, never invest more than you can afford to lose, and ensure it aligns with your overall portfolio allocation. Q3: Does this price drop signal the end of the bull market? A> Not necessarily. Bull markets are characterized by strong uptrends interrupted by sharp corrections. A single drop does not define a trend reversal. The overall market structure and macroeconomic conditions need to be assessed for a clearer picture. Q4: What is the best way to track real-time Bitcoin price movements? A: Use reputable cryptocurrency data aggregators and exchanges like CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, or Binance for live prices, charts, and trading volume. Always cross-reference data from multiple sources. Q5: Are altcoins affected when Bitcoin’s price falls? A: Typically, yes. Bitcoin often sets the tone for the broader crypto market. A significant drop in BTC usually leads to increased selling pressure across most altcoins, a phenomenon known as “Bitcoin dominance.” Q6: How can I protect my portfolio from such volatility? A> Diversification is key. Don’t put all your capital into a single asset. Consider a mix of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and potentially traditional assets. Using stop-loss orders and only investing what you’re comfortable with are fundamental risk management practices. Found this analysis of the falling Bitcoin price helpful?

Nic Puckrin, investment analyst and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, said Bitcoin has staged a “remarkable recovery” over the past day as a “perfect storm of good news” swung momentum back toward the bulls.

He added that traders are watching US weekly jobless claims later on Thursday, which could help support Bitcoin’s upward trajectory if they reinforce the case for easier policy. Across equities, Asia traded mixed. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose about 0.8%, while MSCI’s broad index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan slipped around 0.1%, weighed by declines in Korea and New Zealand. Mainland China benchmarks were little changed to slightly higher and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index inched up, underscoring a cautious tone. Rate Cut Probability Climbs As US Data Softens US index futures were steady after Wednesday’s gains, with contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all modestly higher. European futures were flat to slightly weaker, with DAX and FTSE 100 edging down and CAC 40 a touch stronger. Overnight on Wall Street, small caps led the advance. The Russell 2000 jumped about 1.9% and the S&P 500 notched a second straight rise after US private payrolls posted their biggest drop in more than two and a half years. An Institute for Supply Management survey showed services employment contracting in November and the prices paid subindex falling to a seven-month low, even as overall services activity held near 52.6. The run of softer numbers has strengthened the case for a near-term cut. Fed funds futures now imply roughly an 89% chance of a 25-basis-point reduction at the meeting next week, up from about 83% a week earlier, according to CME’s FedWatch tool. Greenback Hits Five-Week Low, Investors Track Signals On Future Fed Moves The dollar index slipped around 0.4% to 98.878, touching a five-week low and extending its losing streak to a ninth session. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury was steady near 4.07% after a Financial Times report said bond investors have expressed concern to the Treasury that Hassett could push for aggressive rate cuts aligned with President Donald Trump’s preferences. Investors are also dealing with a backlog of US data after a record 43-day government shutdown earlier in the year disrupted the flow of official releases. As delayed reports filter out, traders are placing more weight than usual on private sector surveys and high frequency indicators to gauge the Fed’s path. The next major macro test comes on Friday with the release of the personal consumption expenditures index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge. Until then, markets are trading on the assumption that a December cut is virtually locked in and that 2025 and 2026 policy will hinge on how quickly growth and employment cool from here.

New data reveals a dramatic cooling period, with corporate ETH accumulation plummeting by a staggering 81% in just three months. This sharp reversal signals a potential shift in how major companies view crypto treasury strategies. Let’s unpack what’s behind this slowdown and what it could mean for Ethereum’s future. What Does the Data Say About Corporate ETH Accumulation? According to a report from Cointelegraph citing Bitwise data, the trend of companies buying Ethereum for their treasuries has decelerated sharply. Monthly acquisitions fell from 1.97 million ETH in August to just 370,000 ETH by November. This isn’t a minor dip; it’s a significant pullback that demands attention. The data paints a clear picture: the institutional buying spree that many anticipated would continue has, for now, stalled. Why Has Corporate Buying of Ethereum Slowed Down? Several factors likely contribute to this sudden cooling. First, the broader macroeconomic environment has created uncertainty, making large, speculative treasury allocations less appealing. Second, after a period of aggressive accumulation, some corporations may be pausing to assess their existing holdings and strategy. Furthermore, regulatory clarity around digital assets remains a work in progress in many jurisdictions. This ambiguity can make corporate treasurers hesitant to increase exposure. Notably, Bitmine stands out as an exception, continuing its corporate ETH accumulation in large quantities as the world’s largest corporate holder. What Are the Implications for the Ethereum Market? This slowdown in institutional demand has direct and indirect consequences for the market. Reduced Buying Pressure: A major source of consistent demand has weakened, which can impact price support. Sentiment Shift: Corporate activity is a key sentiment indicator. A pause can influence retail and other institutional investor perceptions. Focus on Utility: It may push the narrative away from pure speculation and toward Ethereum’s actual utility and network developments. However, it’s crucial to view this not as an abandonment but as a strategic pause. Corporate interest in blockchain technology remains high. Is This the End of Institutional Crypto Interest? Absolutely not. This slowdown in corporate ETH accumulation is likely a consolidation phase, not an exodus. Institutions move slowly and strategically. The initial wave of adoption may have been led by crypto-native firms, and we are now in a period where traditional corporations are conducting deeper due diligence. Key developments to watch that could reignite interest include: Clearer regulatory frameworks from major economies. Further development of Ethereum-based financial products (like ETFs). Successful implementation of major Ethereum network upgrades. Actionable Insights for Crypto Observers For investors and market watchers, this trend offers valuable lessons. Don’t interpret short-term data as a long-term prophecy. Monitor the actions of persistent accumulators like Bitmine for conviction signals. Most importantly, diversify your analysis beyond just treasury buying to include metrics like network activity, developer engagement, and DeFi Total Value Locked (TVL). Conclusion: A Pause, Not a Stop The dramatic 81% slowdown in corporate ETH accumulation over three months is a powerful market signal. It highlights how sensitive institutional crypto strategies are to external economic and regulatory winds. While it tempers the near-term narrative of relentless corporate buying, it does not erase the foundational case for institutional blockchain adoption. The market is simply catching its breath, reminding us that the path to mainstream crypto integration will be iterative, not linear. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does the slowdown in corporate ETH buying mean Ethereum is a bad investment? A: Not necessarily. It indicates a shift in short-term institutional tactics, not a verdict on Ethereum’s long-term value. Investment decisions should be based on a wider array of factors, including technology and adoption. Q: Which company is still buying Ethereum aggressively? A: According to the report, Bitmine is noted as the only company continuing to accumulate ETH in large quantities during this period, maintaining its position as the largest corporate holder. Q: Could this slowdown be related to Ethereum’s price performance? A> It’s possible. Periods of price consolidation or decline can lead to reduced buying activity from all market participants, including corporations, as they wait for clearer signals. Q: What would cause corporations to start accumulating ETH again? A> Key triggers could include positive regulatory developments, a sustained bullish turn in the broader crypto market, or significant advancements in Ethereum’s ecosystem that enhance its utility for businesses.

The cryptocurrency landscape is undergoing a seismic shift, not just in prices, but in its very structure. New data reveals a stunning surge in consolidation, with crypto M&A volume hitting an unprecedented $12.9 billion this year. This represents a fivefold increase from 2023, signaling a powerful move towards maturity and strategic positioning within the industry. What’s Driving This Record Crypto M&A Boom? This explosive growth in crypto M&A activity isn’t random. It’s the result of a perfect storm of favorable conditions that emerged in the first half of the year. Major companies launched aggressive acquisition strategies, fueled by three key catalysts: Anticipated Interest Rate Cuts: The prospect of lower borrowing costs made strategic investments and acquisitions more financially attractive for larger firms. Increasing Regulatory Clarity: As governments worldwide began to outline clearer rules, companies gained more confidence to make big, long-term bets on the sector’s future. A Renewed Bull Market: Rising asset prices improved balance sheets and created a positive, growth-oriented environment where deal-making thrives. This combination empowered established players to snap up innovative startups, consolidate market share, and vertically integrate their services at a remarkable pace. How Do We Measure This Crypto M&A Activity? The reported record of $12.9 billion in crypto M&A volume comes from boutique consulting firm Architect Partners. However, it’s important to note that tracking this space can vary. Another leading data provider, PitchBook, reported a total of $8.6 billion in crypto-related deals as of November 20th. This discrepancy highlights the dynamic and sometimes opaque nature of the market. Regardless of the exact figure, both sources point to the same undeniable trend: a massive, multi-billion dollar wave of consolidation is reshaping crypto. Is the Crypto M&A Momentum Sustainable? Here’s where the plot thickens. While the annual total is record-shattering, Bloomberg’s report adds a crucial note of caution. The breakneck pace of crypto M&A deals has shown signs of rapidly declining in recent months. This slowdown correlates directly with the recent downturn in cryptocurrency prices. Market volatility remains a powerful force. When prices drop, sentiment cools, and corporate treasuries become more conservative. This creates a challenging environment for closing the large, strategic deals that fueled the year’s total. The final quarter will be a critical test of whether this consolidation trend has deep roots or was primarily momentum-driven. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto? The historic crypto M&A volume tells a compelling story of evolution. The industry is moving from a wild west of scattered projects to a more organized ecosystem led by consolidated, well-funded entities. For investors and users, this can mean: More Robust Services: Acquired technologies can be integrated to create more powerful and user-friendly platforms. Increased Institutional Trust: Large-scale M&A activity is a hallmark of maturing, legitimate financial sectors. Potential for Reduced Innovation: A valid concern is that consolidation could stifle the disruptive, independent spirit that birthed crypto. The record crypto M&A activity of 2024 is a landmark moment. It proves the sector is building for the long term, with leaders strategically assembling the pieces for the next phase of growth. However, its dependence on market cycles reminds us that in crypto, the only constant is change. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does ‘crypto M&A volume’ mean? A: It refers to the total dollar value of all mergers and acquisitions (M&A) within the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry over a specific period. Q: Why is crypto M&A volume important? A: It’s a key indicator of industry maturity, showing how larger companies are consolidating market share, acquiring technology, and building more comprehensive service offerings. Q: What was the biggest driver of M&A deals this year? A> A combination of factors was crucial, but the anticipation of interest rate cuts, alongside growing regulatory clarity, gave major companies the confidence to pursue aggressive acquisition strategies. Q: Has the pace of deals continued? A> Reports indicate the momentum has slowed recently, likely due to the pullback in cryptocurrency prices, which affects corporate sentiment and spending power. Q: Does more M&A mean less innovation in crypto? A> Not necessarily. While it consolidates power, it also allows proven technologies from startups to be scaled rapidly by larger firms with more resources. The balance between consolidation and innovation is a key trend to watch. Found this insight into the record-breaking crypto M&A landscape valuable?

The country’s Ministry of Justice has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Hedera network to explore moving its entire national real estate registry onto the blockchain. This partnership signals a seismic shift in how governments view and utilize distributed ledger technology for critical public infrastructure. What Does This Hedera Real Estate Partnership Mean for Georgia? The core of this initiative involves migrating data from Georgia’s National Agency of Public Registry to the Hedera blockchain. This isn’t just about digitizing records—it’s about creating an immutable, transparent, and efficient system for property ownership. The Hedera real estate project represents one of the most ambitious government-led blockchain implementations to date, potentially serving as a blueprint for other nations. Authorities are specifically examining how blockchain technology can enhance data security, reduce fraud, and streamline property transactions. The current system, while functional, could benefit from the inherent advantages of distributed ledger technology. This move positions Georgia at the forefront of governmental innovation in the Caucasus region and beyond. How Will Real Estate Tokenization Work in Practice? Beyond registry migration, the MOU includes a crucial review of tokenizing physical properties as Real-World Assets (RWAs). This concept could fundamentally transform property markets by enhancing liquidity and accessibility. Here’s what tokenization might look like: Fractional ownership : Investors could purchase tokens representing shares of high-value properties Enhanced liquidity : Property tokens could be traded on secondary markets more easily than physical real estate Reduced barriers : Smaller investors could participate in real estate markets previously inaccessible to them Automated compliance : Smart contracts could handle regulatory requirements automatically The Hedera real estate initiative could make property investment as simple as trading digital assets, while maintaining all the legal protections of traditional ownership. Why Did Georgia Choose Hedera for This Project? Georgia’s selection of Hedera over other blockchain platforms is significant. Hedera’s hashgraph consensus mechanism offers several advantages for governmental applications: High throughput : Capable of processing thousands of transactions per second Low, predictable fees : Essential for a public registry system used by citizens Energy efficiency : More sustainable than proof-of-work blockchains Governance structure Managed by a council of diverse global organizations These technical characteristics make Hedera particularly suitable for large-scale, public-facing applications like a national property registry. The network’s stability and enterprise focus likely contributed to Georgia’s decision to pursue this Hedera real estate collaboration. What Challenges Might This Blockchain Migration Face? While promising, transitioning a national real estate registry to blockchain presents several challenges that Georgia must address: Data migration complexity : Transferring decades of property records requires meticulous planning Legal framework adaptation : Existing property laws may need updating to recognize blockchain records Public education : Citizens and professionals must understand the new system Integration with legacy systems : Ensuring compatibility with other government databases Security considerations : Protecting against new forms of digital threats However, the potential benefits of increased transparency, reduced fraud, and improved efficiency make these challenges worth addressing. Successful implementation could position Georgia as a leader in governmental blockchain adoption. The Future of Government Services on Blockchain Georgia’s Hedera real estate initiative represents more than just a technological upgrade—it signals a fundamental shift in how governments can leverage blockchain technology. If successful, this project could inspire similar implementations across various sectors: Vehicle registrations and title management Business incorporation and licensing Vital records management (birth certificates, marriage licenses) Voting systems and electoral rolls Supply chain tracking for government contracts The partnership demonstrates how blockchain technology can move beyond cryptocurrency applications to solve real-world governmental challenges. As more nations observe Georgia’s progress, we may witness a global trend toward blockchain-based public services. Conclusion: A New Era for Property Ownership Georgia’s partnership with Hedera to explore moving its real estate registry on-chain represents a visionary approach to modernizing government services. This Hedera real estate project could revolutionize property ownership through enhanced transparency, security, and accessibility. While challenges remain, the potential benefits for citizens, investors, and the government itself are substantial. As blockchain technology continues to mature, partnerships like this one demonstrate its practical utility beyond financial speculation. Georgia’s initiative may well become a case study for other nations considering similar transitions, potentially ushering in a new era of efficient, transparent, and accessible government services worldwide. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is Georgia planning to do with Hedera? Georgia’s Ministry of Justice has signed an MOU with Hedera to explore migrating the national real estate registry to the blockchain and potentially tokenizing properties as Real-World Assets (RWAs). How will blockchain improve Georgia’s real estate registry? Blockchain technology can provide immutable records, reduce fraud, increase transparency, streamline transactions, and potentially enable fractional property ownership through tokenization. Why did Georgia choose Hedera specifically? Hedera offers high throughput, low predictable fees, energy efficiency, and a governance structure managed by a diverse council—all important factors for a national government application. When will this blockchain migration happen? The project is currently in the exploration phase following the MOU signing. A full implementation timeline hasn’t been announced, as authorities need to complete feasibility studies and address regulatory considerations. Will this affect current property owners in Georgia? Current property rights will be maintained and transferred to the new system. The transition should make property transactions more efficient and secure for all citizens. Could this model be replicated in other countries? Absolutely. If successful, Georgia’s Hedera real estate initiative could serve as a blueprint for other nations looking to modernize their property registries using blockchain technology.

Upbit, one of the nation’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has announced a significant operational update. The platform is set to resume its crypto deposit and withdrawal services in a carefully managed, phased approach. This move follows a comprehensive system check and marks a crucial step towards restoring full platform functionality for its users. What Does Upbit’s Service Resumption Mean for You? Starting at 2:00 p.m. UTC on December 3rd, Upbit will begin sequentially restoring services for specific digital assets. The exchange has confirmed the stability of the selected networks after a thorough wallet system check. Therefore, users can expect a secure and stable experience as services come back online. The initial phase will focus on six cryptocurrencies. The first assets to have their deposit and withdrawal functions restored are: ARK ICX DOGE SXP NEAR MINA Why Must You Generate a New Deposit Address? Here is a critical action point for all Upbit users. The exchange has explicitly stated that all previous deposit addresses have been deleted. This is a standard security practice following major system maintenance or checks. Consequently, attempting to send funds to an old address will result in a loss of assets. Before making any deposit for the resumed assets, you must log into your Upbit account and generate a brand-new deposit address. This simple step is non-negotiable for ensuring the safety of your funds. Treat it as your first and most important task when the services go live. How Will the Phased Rollout Work? Upbit’s decision to resume crypto deposit and withdrawal services in phases is a strategic one. It allows their technical team to monitor each network’s performance closely and address any potential issues before expanding to more assets. This method prioritizes security and system integrity over speed. While the announcement specifies the first six coins, it implies that other assets will follow in subsequent phases. Users holding different cryptocurrencies should patiently wait for official announcements from Upbit regarding their specific assets. The exchange will likely provide updates as they confirm the stability of additional networks. What Are the Broader Implications for the Crypto Market? The resumption of Upbit’s core services is a positive signal for the South Korean crypto ecosystem. As a major exchange, its operational health impacts liquidity and trader confidence. The careful, security-first approach demonstrates a commitment to user protection, which is paramount in the current regulatory climate. For traders, this means regaining full control over asset movement. You can now transfer coins to and from personal wallets or other exchanges. However, always remember to: Double-check the network when withdrawing. Start with a small test transaction if you’re unsure. Only use the newly generated deposit addresses from Upbit’s official interface. Conclusion: A Secure Step Forward for Upbit Users In summary, Upbit’s phased restart of crypto deposit and withdrawal services is a carefully executed plan focused on stability and security. The immediate resumption for ARK, ICX, DOGE, SXP, NEAR, and MINA is just the beginning. The most crucial takeaway is the mandatory generation of new deposit addresses to prevent irreversible loss of funds. By following the official guidelines, users can safely resume their trading and transfer activities on this pivotal exchange. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I use my old Upbit deposit address for the resumed coins? A: No. Upbit has deleted all previous deposit addresses. You must generate a new address from your account before making any deposit to avoid losing your funds. Q2: When will deposit and withdrawal services resume for cryptocurrencies not in the first list? A: Upbit has announced a phased rollout. The exchange will likely resume services for other assets after monitoring the stability of the initial networks. Watch for official announcements on their website or blog. Q3: Is there any risk in using the resumed services immediately? A: Upbit has confirmed network stability after system checks. However, as a general best practice in crypto, you may consider starting with a small test transaction for peace of mind. Q4: Does this service resumption affect trading on Upbit? A: This announcement specifically concerns deposit and withdrawal services. Trading for these pairs was likely already active. The resumption allows you to move assets on and off the exchange. Q5: What happens if I send crypto to an old address by mistake? A: Funds sent to a deleted deposit address are typically lost permanently, as the private key for that old address is no longer accessible. Always use the new address generated in your account.

This case, stemming from a 2018 Bitcoin hack, could set a major precedent for user protection and jurisdictional reach in the global cryptocurrency market. The decision sends a clear message: offshore exchanges are not beyond the reach of local laws. What’s the Core of This Binance Lawsuit? The legal battle centers on plaintiff Jonny Chen, who claims hackers stole his Bitcoin from the Binance exchange in 2018. A lower court initially dismissed the case, but Florida’s Third District Court of Appeal has now overturned that ruling. The appellate judges made a crucial finding: California law might apply, and Binance cannot automatically avoid jurisdiction simply because it operates offshore. This pivotal decision means the Binance lawsuit for approximately $80 million in damages can proceed to trial. Why is This Legal Challenge So Significant? This ruling tackles one of the most complex issues in crypto: jurisdiction. For years, global exchanges have operated in a legal gray area. This case challenges the assumption that users have little recourse against foreign-based platforms. The court’s reasoning opens a potential pathway for other users to seek justice. Key implications include: User Protection: Establishes that exchanges may be held accountable in users’ local courts. Legal Precedent: Sets a potential benchmark for how other jurisdictions might handle similar disputes. Exchange Accountability: Forces global platforms to seriously consider the legal frameworks of all regions they serve. What Are the Major Hurdles in This Case? While the ruling is a win for the plaintiff, the path forward is fraught with challenges. Proving the specifics of the hack and Binance’s liability will be difficult. Furthermore, applying California law in a Florida court adds a layer of procedural complexity. The core question remains: can a direct link between Binance’s operations and the plaintiff’s loss be conclusively proven? This Binance lawsuit will test the limits of evidence and legal argument in the digital asset space. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Exchanges? The revival of this lawsuit is a wake-up call for the entire cryptocurrency industry. It underscores the increasing scrutiny from regulators and courts worldwide. Exchanges can no longer rely solely on their Terms of Service and offshore status as shields. They must proactively implement: Robust, transparent security protocols. Clear communication channels for dispute resolution. A deeper understanding of the legal landscapes in all user jurisdictions. The outcome of this Binance lawsuit could directly influence how exchanges design their security and legal compliance strategies for years to come. Conclusion: A Landmark Moment for Crypto Accountability The Florida court’s decision is more than just a case update; it’s a potential turning point. It empowers users and signals that the era of unchecked offshore operation is closing. As the Binance lawsuit moves forward, it will be closely watched by investors, legal experts, and exchange operators globally. The final verdict could redefine the balance of power between massive crypto platforms and the individual users who fund them. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is this Binance lawsuit actually about? A1: It’s an $80 million lawsuit filed by Jonny Chen, who claims his Bitcoin was stolen from Binance during a 2018 hack. A Florida appeals court just ruled the case can proceed after a lower court had dismissed it. Q2: Why did the appeals court overturn the dismissal? A2: The court found that California law might apply to the case and, crucially, that Binance cannot automatically avoid being sued in the U.S. just because it is an offshore exchange. Q3: What does “jurisdiction” mean in this context? A3: Jurisdiction refers to which court has the legal authority to hear a case. This ruling suggests that U.S. courts may have authority over foreign crypto exchanges if they have sufficient connection to users in the country. Q4: Could this affect other cryptocurrency exchanges? A4: Absolutely. This case sets a legal precedent. If successful, it could open the door for similar lawsuits against other global exchanges by users in their local courts, increasing pressure on all platforms to enhance security and compliance. Q5: What happens next in the lawsuit? A5: The case will go back to the lower court for trial. Both sides will present evidence, and the court will determine if Binance is liable for the alleged losses from the 2018 hack. Q6: How can users protect themselves in light of this news? A6: Users should practice good security hygiene: use strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication, consider storing large amounts in non-custodial wallets, and thoroughly understand an exchange’s security measures and terms of service before depositing funds.

After five consecutive days of positive momentum, these popular investment vehicles recorded net outflows of $14.9 million on December 3rd. This sudden shift raises important questions for investors tracking the pulse of institutional cryptocurrency adoption. What does this reversal mean for the broader Bitcoin ETF landscape, and should you be concerned? What Caused the Bitcoin ETF Outflow Reversal? Data from TraderT reveals a nuanced picture behind the headline number. While the overall flow turned negative, not all funds moved in the same direction. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) actually attracted $42.24 million in new investments. However, this positive movement was overwhelmed by significant withdrawals from two other major players. Ark Invest’s ARKB fund saw outflows of $37.09 million, while Grayscale’s GBTC experienced $19.64 million leaving the fund. This divergence highlights how different Bitcoin ETF products can perform independently, even within the same market environment. The net result snapped what had been a promising five-day inflow streak that many analysts were watching closely. How Do Bitcoin ETF Flows Impact Market Sentiment? Spot Bitcoin ETF flows have become a crucial barometer for institutional interest in cryptocurrency. When these funds see consistent inflows, it generally signals growing confidence among professional investors. Conversely, outflows can indicate profit-taking, risk reduction, or shifting allocation strategies. Consider these key factors that influence Bitcoin ETF movements: Market volatility – Price swings in Bitcoin itself often trigger ETF activity Macroeconomic conditions – Interest rate expectations and economic data affect all risk assets Seasonal patterns – Year-end portfolio rebalancing can create temporary distortions Competitive dynamics – Investors may shift between different Bitcoin ETF providers The recent outflow represents a relatively small amount compared to the total assets under management in these funds. However, its psychological impact may outweigh its financial significance, as it breaks a positive trend that many market participants were monitoring. What Should Bitcoin ETF Investors Watch Next? For current and prospective Bitcoin ETF investors, this development serves as a reminder that flows can change direction quickly. Rather than reacting to single data points, consider the broader context. The Bitcoin ETF market remains in its early stages, and occasional volatility in fund flows should be expected. Pay attention to whether this becomes a sustained trend or merely a one-day anomaly. Monitor how different providers perform relative to each other, as this can reveal shifting preferences among institutional allocators. Most importantly, remember that Bitcoin ETF investments should align with your overall risk tolerance and investment horizon, not short-term flow data. The coming days will reveal whether this outflow represents a temporary pause or the beginning of a new trend. What remains clear is that the Bitcoin ETF market continues to evolve, offering both opportunities and challenges for investors seeking exposure to digital assets through traditional financial vehicles. Frequently Asked Questions What are spot Bitcoin ETFs? Spot Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly buying or storing the cryptocurrency themselves. Why did Bitcoin ETFs experience net outflows? The $14.9 million net outflow resulted from larger withdrawals from Ark Invest and Grayscale funds exceeding inflows into BlackRock’s fund, possibly due to profit-taking or portfolio rebalancing. Should I be worried about investing in Bitcoin ETFs after this news? Single-day flow data shouldn’t dictate long-term investment decisions. Bitcoin ETFs, like all investments, experience natural fluctuations in investor interest and capital flows. How often do Bitcoin ETF flows change direction? Flow direction can change daily based on market conditions, investor sentiment, and broader financial market movements. Multi-day streaks in either direction are common. Which Bitcoin ETF performed best during this outflow period? BlackRock’s IBIT was the only major fund with net inflows ($42.24M) on December 3rd, while Ark Invest’s ARKB and Grayscale’s GBTC saw outflows. Where can I track Bitcoin ETF flow data? Several financial data providers track this information, including TraderT, Bloomberg, and various cryptocurrency analytics platforms that specialize in institutional flow data.

This powerful surge signals renewed institutional confidence in Ethereum investment vehicles at a crucial market moment. What Do These Massive ETH Spot ETF Inflows Mean? The data from TraderT reveals more than just numbers—it shows a fundamental shift in investor sentiment. After experiencing outflows for two consecutive days, the sudden influx of nearly $139 million into ETH spot ETFs demonstrates that institutional players see current Ethereum prices as an attractive entry point. More importantly, the complete absence of outflows across all products suggests unanimous bullish sentiment. This development matters because ETH spot ETFs serve as a critical bridge between traditional finance and cryptocurrency markets. When these products attract significant capital, it typically indicates that sophisticated investors anticipate future price appreciation. The timing is particularly noteworthy as we approach year-end portfolio rebalancing. Which ETH Spot ETF Products Led the Charge? The December 3rd inflows weren’t just broad-based—they were led by the industry’s heaviest hitters. Here’s how the major players performed: BlackRock’s ETHA : Dominated with $51.81 million in new investments Fidelity’s FETH : Captured $34.38 million in fresh capital Grayscale’s ETHE : Attracted $27.57 million in inflows Grayscale’s Mini ETH : Saw $20.72 million enter the fund What’s truly remarkable is that no single ETH spot ETF product recorded any outflow whatsoever. This unanimous buying pressure creates a powerful technical setup for Ethereum’s price action in the coming weeks. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About ETH Spot ETF Flows? If you’re wondering why these numbers matter beyond institutional balance sheets, consider this: ETH spot ETF flows often serve as leading indicators for retail market sentiment. When major financial institutions allocate capital to these products, they’re making calculated bets on Ethereum’s medium to long-term prospects. Moreover, the structure of ETH spot ETFs requires fund managers to purchase actual Ethereum to back their shares. This creates direct buying pressure on the underlying asset. The $139 million inflow represents not just paper investment but real demand for ETH tokens in the marketplace. The return to net inflows after two days of outflows suggests that any selling pressure has been absorbed, and buyers have regained control. This pattern frequently precedes positive price momentum as confidence builds across market participants. What Challenges Could ETH Spot ETFs Face Moving Forward? While the December 3rd data paints a bullish picture, investors should remain aware of potential headwinds. Regulatory developments continue to shape the ETH spot ETF landscape, and any negative news from Washington could impact flows. Additionally, broader market volatility often affects these products disproportionately. However, the current data suggests institutional investors are looking beyond short-term noise. The concentration of inflows in established players like BlackRock and Fidelity indicates preference for reputable, well-structured ETH spot ETF products with proven track records. Actionable Insights From the ETH Spot ETF Surge For individual investors, this development offers several practical takeaways. First, monitor ETH spot ETF flows regularly—they provide valuable sentiment indicators. Second, consider how institutional adoption through these products might reduce Ethereum’s volatility over time. Finally, recognize that days with zero outflows across all products represent particularly strong conviction signals. The sheer scale of the December 3rd inflow—$139 million with no offsetting outflows—creates a compelling narrative of renewed institutional confidence. As traditional finance continues embracing cryptocurrency through regulated vehicles like ETH spot ETFs, retail investors gain both validation and valuable market signals. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Ethereum Investment The $139 million net inflow into U.S. ETH spot ETFs represents more than a single day’s trading activity—it marks a potential inflection point in institutional Ethereum adoption. With industry giants like BlackRock leading the charge and not a single dollar flowing out, the message is clear: sophisticated investors see substantial value in current Ethereum prices. This development strengthens the case for Ethereum’s maturation as an institutional-grade asset. As ETH spot ETFs continue attracting capital, they create a virtuous cycle of validation, liquidity, and price discovery that benefits all market participants. The complete absence of outflows suggests this isn’t fleeting interest but rather calculated, conviction-based investment. Frequently Asked Questions What are ETH spot ETFs? ETH spot ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Ethereum tokens. They allow investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without directly buying or storing the cryptocurrency themselves. Why did ETH spot ETFs see $139 million in inflows? The massive inflow likely resulted from institutional investors viewing current Ethereum prices as attractive entry points, combined with year-end portfolio positioning and renewed confidence in cryptocurrency markets. Which ETH spot ETF performed best? BlackRock’s ETHA led with $51.81 million in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FETH with $34.38 million. Grayscale’s products also saw significant investments. What does “zero outflows” mean for investors? Zero outflows across all ETH spot ETF products indicates unanimous buying sentiment with no institutional sellers at current price levels—a strongly bullish signal. How do ETF flows affect Ethereum’s price? ETH spot ETF managers must purchase actual Ethereum to back their shares, creating direct buying pressure that can positively influence the cryptocurrency’s market price. Should retail investors follow institutional ETF flows? While not investment advice, monitoring institutional flows through ETH spot ETFs can provide valuable sentiment indicators and help understand broader market trends. Found this analysis helpful?

XRP Is Currently Above A Parallel Channel’s Support Level In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has shared a pattern that has been forming in the 3-day price of XRP. The pattern in question is a Parallel Channel, a type of consolidation channel in technical analysis (TA). Related Reading: Bitcoin Blasts To $92,000, Liquidating $182 Million In Shorts A Parallel Channel appears whenever an asset’s price consolidates between two parallel trendlines. The upper level of the pattern tends to be a source of resistance, while the lower one that of support. Together, the two lines keep the asset locked in the range between them. Either of the levels not holding up can imply a continuation of the trend in that direction. This breakout is bullish when the price breaks the upper level, while bearish in the case of the lower one. Based on how the channel is aligned relative to the graph axes, Parallel Channels can be divided into a few types. The Ascending Channel corresponds to the case when the channel has a positive slope. Similarly, the Descending Channel is the type where consolidation occurs to a net downside. The channel that XRP has been following over the past year falls in neither category, however, as it belongs to the third and simplest case: a Parallel Channel that’s also parallel to the time-axis. This pattern naturally signifies a phase of true sideways movement in the price. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Parallel Channel that the 3-day price of XRP is trading inside: As displayed in the above graph, the 3-day XRP price recently retested the Parallel Channel’s lower level situated at $2. The coin has since rebounded, indicating that support is holding for now. In the scenario that the coin returns to the level and a retest fails, the analyst has noted that the next level that stands out is the $1.2 level. This level and the support line are separated by the same distance as the height of the Parallel Channel. It now remains to be seen how XRP will develop in the near future and whether the rebound will continue to hold. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders See First Uptick Since April Lows: Bullish Sign? XRP isn’t the only cryptocurrency that has been following a Parallel Channel recently. As Martinez has pointed out in another X post, Ethereum‘s daily price has seemingly been trading inside such a pattern for a few years now. XRP Price XRP has shot up alongside the rest of the cryptocurrency sector as its price has recovered to $2.17.

In a significant boost for the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, the quantitative yield protocol Axis has successfully closed a major funding round. The news that Axis secures $5M funding from a consortium of heavyweight investors signals strong institutional confidence in the future of on-chain yield generation. This capital injection is poised to accelerate the launch of their innovative protocol designed for both USD and Bitcoin. Who Backed the Axis $5M Funding Round? The funding round was led by Galaxy Ventures , a notable force in the crypto investment space. However, they were not alone. The participation of other major players highlights the broad appeal of Axis’s vision. The investor list includes: OKX Ventures : The investment arm of a leading global crypto exchange. FalconX : A major institutional digital asset prime broker. GSR : A well-known cryptocurrency trading firm and market maker. CMS Holdings : A prominent digital asset investment firm. This diverse group of backers brings more than just capital. They offer deep market expertise, liquidity access, and strategic partnerships that could be crucial for Axis’s growth. The fact that Axis secures $5M funding from such established names is a powerful endorsement of its underlying technology and team. What is the Axis Yield Protocol? So, what exactly did these investors see in Axis? The core offering is an on-chain yield protocol . In simple terms, it’s a decentralized system built on a blockchain that automatically seeks out and generates returns, or “yield,” on deposited assets. Axis is specifically targeting two of the largest asset classes: USD-pegged stablecoins and Bitcoin. This focus is strategic. Users holding stablecoins often seek safe returns beyond basic savings accounts. Bitcoin holders, meanwhile, have historically had limited options to earn yield on their holdings without lending them out or taking on significant risk. Axis aims to fill this gap with a quantitative, algorithm-driven approach to yield generation. Why Does This Funding Matter for DeFi? The news that Axis secures $5M funding is a positive indicator for the broader DeFi ecosystem. After a period of market contraction and skepticism, substantial venture capital flowing into a yield-focused project suggests a renewed belief in the sector’s fundamentals. It demonstrates that sophisticated investors are still betting on innovative financial primitives being built on-chain. Furthermore, the involvement of entities like OKX Ventures and FalconX points towards a future where decentralized protocols and centralized service providers work in tandem. This could lead to greater liquidity, better user experience, and more robust financial products for everyone. The funding will allow Axis to enhance security audits, expand its team, and prepare for a secure and scalable mainnet launch. What Are the Potential Challenges Ahead? While the funding is a major milestone, the path forward is not without hurdles. The on-chain yield protocol space is highly competitive. Axis must clearly differentiate itself from existing players. Security will be paramount; any protocol handling user funds must undergo rigorous, continuous auditing to prevent exploits. Moreover, generating sustainable, attractive yield in a transparent and decentralized manner is a complex challenge. Market volatility can quickly erase gains. Therefore, the “quantitative” strategies Axis employs will be under constant scrutiny. Their ability to deliver consistent returns while managing risk will ultimately determine their long-term success. Conclusion: A Confident Step Forward The announcement that Axis secures $5M funding is more than just a financial headline. It is a vote of confidence in a specific vision for the future of finance—one where yield generation is automated, transparent, and accessible directly on the blockchain. With the backing of industry titans, Axis is now well-equipped to develop and launch its protocol. The crypto community will be watching closely to see if this well-funded project can deliver on its promise to revolutionize how we think about earning yield on digital assets like USD and Bitcoin. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Axis? A1: Axis is a quantitative, on-chain yield protocol being developed to generate returns for users who deposit USD-pegged stablecoins and Bitcoin. Q2: How much funding did Axis raise and who led it? A2: Axis raised $5 million in a funding round led by Galaxy Ventures, with participation from OKX Ventures, FalconX, GSR, and CMS Holdings. Q3: What is an on-chain yield protocol?

It is crucial to only use well-audited protocols, never invest more than you can afford to lose, and understand the risks involved. Q6: How is Axis different from other yield platforms? A6: While details are still emerging, Axis emphasizes a “quantitative” approach, likely using advanced algorithms to optimize yield strategies. Its specific focus on both stablecoins and Bitcoin also sets it apart from many competitors. Found this breakdown of the Axis funding news insightful?

Firelight has officially launched its XRP staking protocol on the Flare network, creating new opportunities to earn rewards with your digital assets. This move bridges the world of XRP with Flare’s smart contract capabilities, potentially unlocking significant value for the community. What is Firelight’s New XRP Staking Protocol? Firelight’s protocol represents a strategic integration within the Flare ecosystem, which is itself built to complement and expand XRP’s utility. The core innovation is the introduction of a new liquidity token called stXRP. When users participate, they essentially convert their XRP into a yield-bearing asset within the Flare DeFi environment. The process is straightforward. First, you bridge your XRP to the Flare network, where it becomes wrapped as FXRP. Then, you deposit this FXRP into the Firelight protocol. In return, you receive stXRP tokens on a one-to-one basis. These tokens represent your staked position. How Does This XRP Staking Protocol Work? Understanding the mechanics is key. The protocol is designed with a DeFi insurance model at its heart. This model aims to provide a sustainable source for the staking rewards, differentiating it from simple inflationary models. Bridge XRP to FXRP: Move your XRP onto the Flare blockchain. Deposit into Firelight: Lock your FXRP in the protocol’s smart contracts. Receive stXRP: Get a tokenized proof of your deposit. Future Rewards: Earn yields once the reward mechanism is activated. Currently, the stXRP token can be freely transferred or used in other Flare-based applications, offering liquidity. However, its core staking reward function is not yet live. This phased approach allows the protocol to establish itself securely before distributing yields. What Are the Benefits and Current Limitations? This launch is a promising step, but it’s important to view it with a balanced perspective. The primary benefit is access to a new XRP staking protocol on a network built for interoperability. It brings XRP into the expansive world of decentralized finance, where it can be used in lending, borrowing, and other yield-generating activities. However, the main limitation is clear: rewards are not yet active. Users are depositing assets in anticipation of future functionality. Furthermore, as with any new DeFi project, there are inherent smart contract and ecosystem risks to consider. The success of the reward model depends on the adoption and health of the broader Flare DeFi landscape. Why is This Launch Significant for Crypto Investors? This development is more than just another staking option. It signifies the growing integration between major layer-1 assets like XRP and emerging smart contract platforms like Flare. For investors, it represents a potential new avenue for yield on an asset that traditionally had limited native staking options. The creation of stXRP also introduces a novel financial primitive. If successful, this token could become a key liquidity pillar within Flare, used across multiple protocols. Early participants may benefit from being first in line when rewards begin. Therefore, keeping a close eye on the activation timeline for the XRP staking protocol rewards is crucial. Conclusion: A Strategic Step for XRP Utility Firelight’s launch marks a strategic expansion of XRP’s use cases. By deploying an XRP staking protocol on Flare, it connects two aligned ecosystems and offers holders a path to potentially generate passive income. While the reward engine is still warming up, the infrastructure is now in place. For those interested in the convergence of major cryptocurrencies and DeFi, this is a development worth monitoring closely as it evolves from a promising protocol to a fully functional yield generator. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is stXRP? A: stXRP is a liquidity token you receive for depositing FXRP (wrapped XRP on Flare) into the Firelight protocol. It represents your staked position and will eventually generate rewards. Q: Are staking rewards live yet? A: No, the staking reward function for the XRP staking protocol has not been activated. Firelight has launched the deposit mechanism first, with rewards to follow. Q: How do I start staking my XRP on Flare? A: You need to bridge your XRP to the Flare network to create FXRP, then deposit that FXRP into the Firelight protocol to receive stXRP tokens. Q: Can I sell or trade my stXRP tokens? A: Yes, stXRP can be transferred freely within the Flare ecosystem, meaning you can potentially trade it on supported decentralized exchanges. Q: What is the DeFi insurance model for rewards? A: While exact details may evolve, this model typically uses fees or premiums from other DeFi activities (like insurance pools) to fund staking rewards, aiming for a sustainable yield source. Q: Is there any risk to using this protocol? A> As with any DeFi protocol, risks include smart contract vulnerabilities, fluctuations in asset value, and the dependency on the Flare ecosystem’s growth for sustainable rewards.

The newly launched Grayscale LINK Spot ETF (GLNK) exploded onto the scene, recording a staggering $37.05 million in net inflows on its very first day of trading. This immediate and substantial demand sends a clear signal about institutional and retail appetite for structured, regulated access to Chainlink’s oracle network. Let’s unpack this remarkable debut and its implications. What Does the Grayscale LINK Spot ETF’s Strong Start Mean? Data from SoSoValue confirms the Grayscale LINK Spot ETF began trading on the NYSE Arca with impressive momentum. A net inflow of $37.05 million signifies that far more capital entered the fund than left it, demonstrating strong initial buying pressure. This is not just a minor blip; it’s a significant show of strength for an asset beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum in the ETF space. Therefore, this debut challenges the notion that investor interest is limited to the two largest cryptocurrencies. Why Is This Grayscale ETF Launch So Significant? The success of the Grayscale LINK Spot ETF extends beyond a single day’s numbers. It represents a crucial milestone for the entire crypto ecosystem. Firstly, it provides a seamless, familiar investment vehicle for traditional finance participants to gain exposure to LINK. Secondly, it validates Chainlink’s fundamental role as critical infrastructure for smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi). Lower Barrier to Entry: Investors can buy GLNK shares in a regular brokerage account, avoiding the complexities of crypto exchanges and wallets. Regulatory Clarity: Trading on a major exchange like NYSE Arca offers a layer of oversight and security that appeals to cautious capital. Market Maturity: The launch signals that the market is maturing to support ETFs for crypto assets with specific, real-world utility. How Does This Impact Chainlink and the Broader Crypto Market? The immediate effect of the Grayscale LINK Spot ETF inflow is a direct purchase of underlying LINK tokens by the fund’s custodian. This creates buying pressure in the spot market. Moreover, this institutional endorsement can enhance Chainlink’s credibility and attract further developer and enterprise adoption. For the broader market, a successful GLNK debut paves the way for potential spot ETFs for other altcoins with strong use cases, potentially unlocking billions in new capital. What Are the Challenges and Considerations for Investors? While the debut is overwhelmingly positive, savvy investors should consider a few points. The Grayscale LINK Spot ETF , like others, carries management fees that can erode returns over time compared to holding the asset directly. Furthermore, the price of GLNK shares will track LINK’s price but may trade at a slight premium or discount to the net asset value (NAV). As with any crypto investment, volatility remains a key factor. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Crypto Investment The stunning $37.05 million first-day inflow for the Grayscale LINK Spot ETF is more than just a number. It is a resounding declaration of institutional and mainstream interest in blockchain utility. This event marks a pivotal step toward a future where accessing specific crypto protocols is as easy as buying a stock. The success of GLNK strengthens Chainlink’s position and opens the door for a more diverse and mature crypto ETF landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is the Grayscale LINK Spot ETF (GLNK)? A: It is an exchange-traded fund launched by Grayscale Investments that holds actual Chainlink (LINK) tokens. It allows investors to buy shares that track LINK’s price without directly owning the cryptocurrency. Q: Where does the $37.05 million net inflow go? A: The capital is used by the fund to purchase more underlying LINK tokens, which are held in secure custody. This increases the fund’s assets under management (AUM). Q: How is this different from a Bitcoin Spot ETF? A: While both are spot ETFs (holding the actual asset), GLNK is focused solely on Chainlink, a decentralized oracle network, rather than a store-of-value cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. Q: Can I buy the Grayscale LINK Spot ETF in my retirement account? A: Potentially, yes. Since it trades on the NYSE Arca like a stock, it may be eligible for purchase within certain IRA or 401(k) brokerage accounts, depending on your provider’s rules. Q: Does this mean Chainlink’s price will definitely go up? A: While the ETF creates new demand, cryptocurrency prices are influenced by many factors, including broader market sentiment, technology developments, and competition. The ETF is a strong positive signal, not a guarantee. Q: Are there other crypto spot ETFs besides Bitcoin and LINK? A: Currently, in the U.S., approved spot ETFs are primarily for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Grayscale LINK Spot ETF is a pioneering product for an altcoin, and its success could lead to more.

The agency’s Gaming Division issued cease-and-desist letters to KalshiEX LLC, Robinhood Derivatives LLC and Crypto.com, accusing all three of offering sports wagers in Connecticut without a license and in violation of state gaming law. The order covers so-called “sports event contracts” and any other form of online gambling the platforms make available to residents. Officials Argue Prediction Markets Are Being Marketed As Investments “Only licensed entities may offer sports wagering in the state of Connecticut,” Consumer Protection Commissioner Bryan T. Cafferelli said. None of the three firms hold such a license in the state, he added, and even if they did, the contracts they offer would still run afoul of rules that ban wagers for anyone under 21. Today, DCP's Gaming Division issued Cease and Desist orders to three platforms conducting unlicensed sports wagering. Learn why Prediction Market Platforms offering ""Sports Events"" Contracts are illegal: https://t.co/LXLK1tRR0w — Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection (@CTDCP) December 3, 2025 Gaming Director Kris Gilman said the firms are “deceptively advertising that their services are legal,” arguing that they operate outside the state’s regulatory perimeter and pose “a serious risk to consumers” who may not realise they have no formal protections. “A prediction market wager is not an investment,” she said, drawing a line between trading and betting. State Warns That Unvetted House Rules Can Lead To Unfair Payout Practices Regulators say the products raise a series of integrity and consumer protection issues. Because the platforms are not licensed, they are not required to meet Connecticut’s technical standards for wagering systems, leaving financial and personal data more exposed in the event of failures or abuse. The state also says there are no mandated integrity controls, such as systems to block insiders from betting on events where they have advance knowledge or influence over outcomes. By contrast, licensed operators must use controls to bar known insiders and monitor and report suspicious betting patterns. Any regulator does not vet house rules that govern how wagers pay out, the department warned, which means customers may have little recourse if bets are settled in unexpected ways or winnings are withheld. If disputes arise, the agency says it has no clear path to recover funds for users of these unlicensed platforms. State Says Platforms Listed Events Vulnerable To Insider Knowledge Connecticut officials also object to the types of events the platforms list. They say some wagers cover outcomes known to or heavily influenced by a relatively small group of insiders, such as award shows, professional team trades and similar events. State law prohibits betting on events where the outcome is known in advance because it is inherently unfair to ordinary bettors. The department alleges the firms advertised and offered wagers to people on the state’s Voluntary Self-Exclusion List and to individuals under 21, and even promoted services on college campuses, all of which it says are illegal under Connecticut law. Under the cease-and-desist orders, Kalshi, Robinhood and Crypto.com must immediately stop advertising, offering, promoting or otherwise making sports event contracts or any other unlicensed online gambling products to Connecticut residents. They must also allow residents to withdraw any funds currently held on their platforms. Failure to comply could trigger civil penalties under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act and potential criminal action for breaches of the state’s gaming statutes. For now, the state reminded residents that only three operators are authorised to take sports bets, namely DraftKings through Foxwoods, FanDuel through Mohegan Sun and Fanatics through the Connecticut Lottery, with a minimum age of 21 for sports wagering and 18 for fantasy contests.

A Trump family-led DeFi project is poised to launch a revolutionary real-world asset product this January, potentially reshaping how traditional and crypto markets interact. This bold move signals a new era of institutional-grade DeFi adoption. What Makes This Trump Family-Led DeFi Project Different? World Liberty Financial (WLFI) represents more than just another cryptocurrency initiative. This Trump family-led DeFi project focuses specifically on real-world asset tokenization. Unlike many DeFi platforms that operate purely in the digital realm, WLFI aims to create tangible bridges between blockchain technology and traditional financial instruments. The project’s January launch targets a crucial gap in current market offerings. By tokenizing real-world assets, they enable fractional ownership and increased liquidity for assets typically locked in traditional finance. This approach could democratize access to investment opportunities previously reserved for institutional players. How Will RWA Tokenization Transform Finance? Real-world asset tokenization represents the next evolutionary step for decentralized finance. The Trump family-led DeFi project plans to convert physical and traditional financial assets into digital tokens on the blockchain. This process offers several transformative benefits: Increased liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets Fractional ownership opportunities for smaller investors Transparent tracking of asset ownership and transfers Reduced settlement times compared to traditional systems Global accessibility without geographic restrictions However, this innovation also faces significant challenges. Regulatory compliance, asset verification, and legal frameworks remain substantial hurdles that the project must navigate successfully. Why Does This Trump Family Involvement Matter? The involvement of the Trump family brings unprecedented mainstream attention to the Trump family-led DeFi project . This high-profile backing could accelerate institutional adoption of RWA tokenization. Traditional investors who previously hesitated to enter the crypto space might find comfort in familiar names associated with the project. Moreover, this development signals growing political and financial establishment interest in blockchain technology. When prominent figures engage with DeFi projects, it often precedes broader market acceptance and regulatory clarity. The January launch could therefore serve as a catalyst for wider RWA adoption across the industry. What Can We Expect From the January Launch? The upcoming January release of the Trump family-led DeFi project’s RWA product will likely focus on specific asset classes initially. Real estate, commodities, and intellectual property represent probable starting points for tokenization. The success of this launch could determine how quickly other projects follow suit with similar offerings. Investors should watch for several key indicators: the types of assets tokenized, the regulatory framework established, and the initial market response. These factors will reveal whether this ambitious project can deliver on its promise to connect DeFi with traditional markets effectively. Conclusion: A New Chapter for DeFi and Traditional Finance The January launch of this Trump family-led DeFi project marks a pivotal moment for both cryptocurrency and traditional finance. By bridging these worlds through RWA tokenization, World Liberty Financial could unlock trillions in currently illiquid assets. This development represents more than just another crypto product—it’s a potential paradigm shift in how we conceptualize asset ownership and investment accessibility. Frequently Asked Questions What is World Liberty Financial (WLFI)? World Liberty Financial is a DeFi project with Trump family involvement that focuses on tokenizing real-world assets to bridge traditional finance and cryptocurrency markets. What does RWA mean in cryptocurrency? RWA stands for Real-World Assets, referring to the process of converting physical or traditional financial assets into digital tokens on a blockchain for trading and ownership purposes.

This significant Bitcoin price surge marks a pivotal moment for the flagship cryptocurrency, signaling robust investor confidence and potentially setting the stage for a new market phase. The rally was confirmed on major exchanges like Binance, where BTC/USDT trading pairs solidified the breakthrough. What’s Driving the Remarkable Bitcoin Price Surge? The recent Bitcoin price surge above $93,000 isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several key factors are contributing to this powerful upward momentum. First, increasing institutional adoption continues to provide a solid foundation of demand. Moreover, macroeconomic conditions, including concerns about inflation, are pushing investors towards assets perceived as stores of value. This combination creates a perfect environment for significant price appreciation. Market sentiment has shifted dramatically from the cautious optimism of recent months to outright bullishness. Trading volumes have spiked alongside the price, indicating strong conviction behind the move. This isn’t a fleeting spike; it’s a sustained push that reflects deep market support. Therefore, understanding the drivers is crucial for anyone watching the crypto space. How Does This Rally Compare to Previous Bitcoin Highs? Every major Bitcoin price surge tells a unique story. The climb past $93,000 places Bitcoin in a territory last seen during periods of intense market euphoria. However, the context today is different. The market is more mature, with greater regulatory clarity and more sophisticated financial products like ETFs. This infrastructure supports a more stable growth trajectory, potentially reducing the volatility that characterized past rallies. Key differences in this rally include: Institutional Participation: Large funds and corporations are now major holders. Global Recognition: Bitcoin is increasingly treated as a legitimate asset class. Network Strength: The underlying blockchain is more secure and widely used than ever. These factors suggest the current Bitcoin price surge may have a more sustainable foundation. What Should Investors Consider During This Volatility? A rapid Bitcoin price surge brings both opportunity and risk. For investors, the key is to avoid emotional decision-making. First, assess your risk tolerance. Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile, and sharp gains can be followed by corrections. Second, consider your investment horizon. Are you trading for short-term profit, or do you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition? Your strategy should match your goals. It’s also wise to practice sound risk management. This can include: Diversifying your crypto portfolio beyond just Bitcoin. Setting clear profit-taking and stop-loss levels. Only investing capital you can afford to lose. Remember, the excitement of a Bitcoin price surge should not override a disciplined investment plan. What’s the Future Outlook After Breaking $93,000? Breaking the $93,000 level is a major psychological and technical milestone. Technically, it opens the path toward testing even higher resistance levels. Market analysts will now watch to see if Bitcoin can consolidate above this new support zone. A successful hold could fuel confidence for a move toward the next big round number, attracting even more market attention. Fundamentally, the long-term outlook remains tied to adoption trends, regulatory developments, and broader economic factors. While the current Bitcoin price surge is impressive, sustainable growth depends on continuous network development and real-world utility. The coming weeks will be critical in determining whether this is the start of a new bull market or a local peak.

According to live data from Binance’s USDT market, BTC is currently trading at $91,995.6. This sudden shift has sent ripples through the crypto community, prompting urgent questions about market stability and future direction. What’s driving this volatility, and should investors be concerned? Let’s break down the key factors at play. What Caused the Sudden Bitcoin Price Drop? The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile, and several interconnected factors can trigger rapid price movements. The recent dip in the Bitcoin price below $92,000 is likely not an isolated event. Therefore, understanding the broader context is crucial for any investor. Key potential catalysts include: Market-Wide Profit-Taking: After a period of gains, large holders (whales) and retail investors often sell to lock in profits, creating downward pressure. Shifts in Macroeconomic Sentiment: Global economic indicators, such as inflation data or central bank policy hints, can instantly impact risk assets like Bitcoin. Liquidity and Leverage Flush: Highly leveraged positions in the derivatives market can lead to cascading liquidations during a minor dip, amplifying the sell-off. Is This a Buying Opportunity or a Warning Sign? For seasoned crypto enthusiasts, price corrections are a normal part of the market cycle. However, the sharp move below $92,000 serves as a stark reminder of the asset’s inherent unpredictability. The current Bitcoin price action presents a classic dilemma: is this a temporary pullback offering a strategic entry point, or the beginning of a deeper correction? Historically, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience, often rebounding from such levels when long-term fundamentals remain strong. These fundamentals include continued institutional adoption, the upcoming halving event’s supply shock, and its proven role as a digital store of value. Consequently, a dip can be a moment for careful evaluation rather than panic. How Should Traders Navigate This Volatility? Navigating a fluctuating Bitcoin price requires a clear strategy and emotional discipline. First, avoid making decisions based on fear or greed. Instead, consider these actionable insights: Review Your Portfolio Allocation: Ensure your exposure to volatile assets like Bitcoin aligns with your overall risk tolerance and investment goals. Dollar-Cost Average (DCA): Consider spreading your purchases over time to average out the cost, rather than trying to time the market perfectly. Set Clear Stop-Losses and Take-Profit Levels: Having predefined exit points can protect your capital and lock in gains automatically. Stay Informed, Not Overwhelmed: Follow reliable sources for market analysis, but don’t let hourly price chatter dictate your long-term strategy. The Bottom Line on the Current Bitcoin Price Action The drop below $92,000 is a significant market event that underscores the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency investing. While short-term price movements can be nerve-wracking, they rarely alter the long-term trajectory of a fundamentally sound asset like Bitcoin. The key is to separate signal from noise. By focusing on core principles—sound risk management, a long-term perspective, and continuous education—investors can navigate these waves with greater confidence. Remember, market cycles present both challenges and opportunities; your strategy determines which one you encounter. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why did the Bitcoin price fall below $92,000? A1: The drop is likely due to a combination of factors including market-wide profit-taking, reactions to broader economic news, and the liquidation of over-leveraged positions in the derivatives market. Q2: Is now a good time to buy Bitcoin? A2: A lower Bitcoin price can present a buying opportunity for long-term investors using strategies like dollar-cost averaging. However, it’s essential to conduct your own research and invest only what you can afford to lose. Q3: Could the Bitcoin price drop further? A3> Cryptocurrency markets are volatile, and further drops are always possible. Traders should monitor key support levels and overall market sentiment for clues. Q4: How does this affect other cryptocurrencies? A4: Bitcoin often sets the trend for the broader crypto market. A significant drop in BTC can lead to increased selling pressure across altcoins, a phenomenon known as “Bitcoin dominance.” Q5: Where can I track the live Bitcoin price? A5> You can track real-time prices on major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken, or use aggregated data platforms like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko. Q6: What long-term factors still support Bitcoin’s value? A6> Despite short-term volatility, long-term supporters point to the fixed supply (21 million cap), increasing institutional adoption, its role as “digital gold,” and the upcoming halving events as key value drivers.

While traditional financial assets like stocks and bonds are often gifted to children by parents who open custodial accounts, crypto exchange Binance aims to help families build wealth through crypto assets. Announced on Wednesday during Binance Blockchain Week, the crypto exchange explained that “Binance Junior” is the first standalone mobile app that is controlled entirely by parents for children. Introducing Binance Junior, a parent-controlled app and sub-account for kids and teens. Build family-focused crypto savings and prepare your child for a future empowered by crypto. Try it now https://t.co/q4Y50PvApy pic.twitter.com/O1R2yZ4vVE — Binance (@binance) December 3, 2025 The app allows adults with a Binance account to deposit crypto into a savings account for kids and teenagers between the ages of 6 to 17. The tool also allows parents to set spending and transfer limits, while enabling earn products for kids dependent on local regulations. The Importance of Crypto Adoption at Young Ages Binance’s newly appointed co-founder Yi He explained the importance behind Binance Junior at Binance Blockchain Week. “We not only nurture children in their early development, but also with long-term growth, responsibility and wisdom,” the executive stated. “Helping children face real life challenges independently means that financial health and literacy are key to preparing them for the future, especially as money is evolving.” While the notion of educating children on the importance of cryptocurrency may be controversial, findings from a recent survey conducted by Gemini show that more than half (51%) of global Gen Z respondents currently own cryptocurrency or have owned it in the past. The report also notes that over half of Gen Z respondents located in the US owned or had owned cryptocurrency (51%), compared to 49% of Millennials (people born 1981-1994). Source: Gemini This demonstrates the growing appeal for crypto adoption amongst younger generations. Binance Junior aims to further facilitate this by allowing children 13 years and up to initiate transfers independently within the app, as long as local regulations are met and daily limits are applied. Teaching Children About Crypto: Beneficial or Concerning? While some users on the social media platform X expressed concerns around Binance Junior, the new app aims to align with a growing trend of teaching children about the importance of cryptocurrency at early ages. Henri Arslanian, co-founder of Nine Blocks Capital and a best-selling author, told Cryptonews that it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Binance has launched Binance Junior. “Children used to have penny banks to keep fiat in, but now we have hard assets like Bitcoin and there is a huge learning element there that becomes critical,” he said. Arslanian added that Binance Junior aligns with children’s books and toys centered around cryptocurrency. In September last year, Arslanian published Decoding Crypto, a best-selling children’s book that explains digital assets in simple terms. Here’s why you should check out my latest kids book, Decoding Crypto, for your kids.

Goodnight Crypto by Scott Blair is a book that is even suitable for toddlers. Included in the story are 42 collectible non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that can be minted and added to a crypto wallet. In addition, Binance released a self-published book entitled ABC’s of Crypto that breaks down fundamental terms including security and blockchain technology, to different types of crypto coins. Cautiously Preparing the Next Generation for Crypto Adoption While it’s notable that initiatives are being taken to teach young children about digital assets, caution should be exercised. Parents and teachers explaining cryptocurrency to younger generations may wish to point out the volatile nature of digital assets . Focusing on concepts like savings, diversification, long-term thinking, and risk versus reward rather than price speculation may also be helpful.

Prosecutors aim to confiscate a colossal $214 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum from a former government official, Georgy Satyukov, alleging the funds were received as a bribe. This case sends a powerful message about the traceability of crypto in major corruption investigations. What Are the Details of This Massive Cryptocurrency Seizure? According to reports from DL News, Russian prosecutors have filed to seize approximately $184 million in Bitcoin (BTC) and $30 million in Ethereum (ETH). The target is Georgy Satyukov, a former official at the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Authorities allege he accepted this enormous payment as a bribe between March and October 2021. The case centers on accusations that Satyukov received the crypto from an operator of the now-defunct WEX exchange. In return, he allegedly promised to prevent a criminal prosecution against the individual. Satyukov is currently a fugitive, adding a layer of international intrigue to this pursuit of a major cryptocurrency seizure . How Is the WEX Exchange Connected to This Case? The source of the alleged bribe is crucial to understanding the scale of this operation. The WEX cryptocurrency exchange has a notorious history in the crypto world. Acquisition: WEX acquired the infamous BTC-e exchange in 2017. Shutdown: It ceased operations in 2018 after its founder, Alexander Vinnik, was arrested on charges of fraud and money laundering. Legacy: The exchange was allegedly used for illicit activities, making it a focal point for global financial investigators. This connection suggests the funds in this potential cryptocurrency seizure may be linked to a wider web of alleged financial crime, raising the stakes for Russian prosecutors. Why Is This Cryptocurrency Seizure Case So Significant? This case is not just about the staggering dollar amount. It represents several key developments in the global fight against corruption and cybercrime. Traceability Demonstrated: It challenges the myth of cryptocurrency’s complete anonymity, showing that large transactions can be tracked by authorities. Legal Precedent: A successful seizure would set a powerful legal precedent for recovering digital assets in corruption cases worldwide. Regulatory Focus: It underscores why governments are intensifying regulations around crypto exchanges and transactions. Therefore, the outcome of this cryptocurrency seizure attempt will be closely watched by regulators, law enforcement, and the crypto industry alike. What Challenges Do Authorities Face in Such Seizures? While the intent is clear, executing a cryptocurrency seizure of this magnitude is fraught with technical and legal hurdles. Accessing Wallets: Authorities must secure the private keys to the wallets holding the BTC and ETH. Fugitive Status: With Satyukov on the run, physically locating him and any hardware wallets becomes a complex international effort. Asset Liquidation: If seized, converting $214 million in crypto to fiat currency without destabilizing the market poses another significant challenge. Overcoming these obstacles will test the capabilities of Russia’s financial crime units and their cooperation with global agencies. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Regulation? This landmark case is a clear signal to the world. Governments are developing the tools to investigate and reclaim digital assets tied to crime. For the crypto ecosystem, it emphasizes the importance of compliance and Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols for exchanges. For investors, it reinforces that while crypto offers new opportunities, it remains within the reach of the law. The pursuit of this cryptocurrency seizure marks a pivotal moment where traditional legal systems are forcefully adapting to the digital asset age. In conclusion, Russia’s attempt to seize $214 million in cryptocurrency from a former official is more than a headline-grabbing corruption case. It is a stark demonstration of evolving law enforcement techniques in the digital era. This case proves that large-scale crypto transactions are traceable and that governments are willing to pursue them aggressively. The success or failure of this cryptocurrency seizure will undoubtedly influence future regulations and international cooperation on digital asset crimes for years to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Who is Georgy Satyukov? Georgy Satyukov is a former official at Russia’s Ministry of Internal Affairs. He is currently a fugitive, wanted by Russian prosecutors for allegedly accepting a $214 million bribe in cryptocurrency. 2. What is the WEX exchange? WEX was a cryptocurrency exchange that acquired the notorious BTC-e platform. It shut down in 2018 after its founder was arrested on money laundering charges, and it is central to the allegations in this seizure case. 3. Can cryptocurrency really be seized by governments? Yes. While challenging, governments can seize cryptocurrency by legally compelling individuals or exchanges to surrender private keys, or by tracking and freezing assets on compliant exchanges that follow court orders. 4. Why is this case important for the average crypto user? This case highlights that cryptocurrency transactions are not completely anonymous. It underscores the importance of using regulated platforms and understanding that large, illicit transactions can be investigated and potentially recovered. 5. What happens to the cryptocurrency if it is successfully seized? Typically, seized assets are held by the government and may eventually be liquidated (sold) at auction or through markets, with the proceeds going to the state treasury. 6. Could this happen in other countries? Absolutely. Many countries, including the United States and members of the European Union, have increasingly sophisticated units dedicated to tracking and seizing cryptocurrency linked to crimes. Found this deep dive into one of the largest potential cryptocurrency seizure cases intriguing? The world of crypto regulation is fast-moving.

This comeback is seen as a necessary relief rally, pushing Bitcoin's price up to $93,007.12. After several weeks of falling prices, this price reversal seems strong and is supported by three main factors working together: macroeconomic policy shifts, unprecedented institutional distribution access, and highly compressed technical indicators. By Zain Vawda Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has successfully rebounded, passing the important $93,000 price point that many market participants have been watching. This comeback is seen as a necessary relief rally, pushing Bitcoin's price up to $93,007.12, which marks a 6.6% increase in just the last 24 hours. After several weeks of falling prices, this price reversal seems strong and is supported by three main factors working together: significant changes in global economic policies (macroeconomic policy shifts), the fact that large investment firms can now easily buy and sell Bitcoin (unprecedented institutional distribution access), and certain patterns on the price charts that suggested a bounce was due (highly compressed technical indicators). (Source: TradingView) The Factors Influencing Bitcoin's Recovery First, the US central bank (Federal Reserve) has officially ended its program of removing money from the economy (Quantitative Tightening, or QT), which means they are now moving toward a policy that makes money more easily available (accommodating monetary policy). This boost in available money, or liquidity injection, has happened at the same time as a major shift in how large financial institutions view Bitcoin. Second, investment firm Vanguard, which manages $9 trillion, has made it easier for its clients to access Bitcoin through certain investment products (third-party crypto ETFs). Third, technical analysis suggests a huge move is coming. The price charts show that the price swings (volatility) have been at historic lows - a pattern that has always happened right before a massive, rapid price increase (parabolic price movements). While these factors suggest the price is heading strongly upward and could soon go above $100,000, there is an immediate risk: the market remains fragile. There is not enough trading volume right now (market depth has not fully recovered), meaning there isn't much liquidity. In this kind of environment, the market is highly prone to large, sudden price swings, making it very sensitive to any bad news or unexpected selling that forces traders to quickly close their positions (liquidation events). However, because the fundamental drivers such as money flowing from central banks and real demand from major financial institutions are so strong, experts believe this price momentum is likely to last and is more than just a temporary fluctuation. Institutional Demand Mechanics: The Distribution Revolution The money flowing from large investment firms into Bitcoin has made a significant turnaround, suggesting that a period where money was rapidly leaving the market is over. Investment products known as US spot Bitcoin ETFs have started seeing money flow back in (net inflows), reversing four straight weeks where over $4.3 billion had been pulled out. Although the first week's rebound was modest at about $70 million, this shift confirms that institutional money is actively returning to the market. This money is not just coming from one source. While BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is recovering, major inflows went into funds managed by Fidelity ($77.5 million) and ARK 21Shares ($88 million), showing a broad return of interest across many institutional players. These ETFs now manage over $119 billion and hold 6.5% of all existing Bitcoin, making them a permanent and crucial source of demand. A huge structural change, dubbed the ""Vanguard Effect,"" also boosted demand. Vanguard, one of the world's largest investment managers with up to $10 trillion in assets, started allowing its clients to buy crypto ETFs and mutual funds tied to Bitcoin and other digital assets (like ETH, XRP, and SOL) on its platform. This move created immediate and massive demand, causing Bitcoin's price to jump 6% right when the US market opened. On that first day, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF ( IBIT ) recorded about $1 billion in trading volume in the first half hour alone. By making it easier for cautious, long-term investments, such as retirement and pension funds, to buy Bitcoin, Vanguard has permanently expanded the asset's reach, ensuring strong, sustained demand well into 2026. Technical Analysis - BTC/USD The confluence of positive structural and technical factors lends strong support to bullish forecasts heading into 2026. Looking at structure and the setup appears highly bullish, and the path forward will likely be non-linear and volatile. The four-hour chart below has seen a shift in structure, with price breaking above the previous swing high and resting on support at 91804. Resistance to the upside may be found at 95000 before the 97000 and 100000 handles come into focus. A potential pullback toward 90000 or the recent breakout at around the 86600 mark cannot be ruled out before the next leg higher. The primary immediate risks center on macroeconomic data surprises. Any unexpectedly high reading in the PCE inflation data or stronger-than-expected labor reports could quickly dampen December rate cut expectations, triggering a sharp reversal in the relief rally.

The mining company, founded by Eric Trump, recently announced it now holds 4,367 BTC—a substantial jump of 363 Bitcoin from its previous disclosure. This strategic accumulation raises important questions about institutional Bitcoin adoption and mining profitability in today’s market. What Does American Bitcoin’s Major BTC Holdings Increase Mean? When a prominent mining company like American Bitcoin announces a 363 BTC increase in its holdings, it sends a powerful signal to the market. This isn’t just about numbers—it represents a calculated decision to hold rather than sell mined Bitcoin. The company’s official social media channels confirmed the new total of 4,367 BTC, demonstrating confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. This move aligns with growing trends where mining operations transition from pure revenue generators to strategic asset accumulators. Eric Trump’s involvement adds an interesting dimension to the story. As the second son of former U.S. President Donald Trump, his venture into Bitcoin mining bridges political and technological spheres. The company’s growth reflects how cryptocurrency enterprises are gaining mainstream legitimacy while navigating complex regulatory landscapes. How Does This Impact Bitcoin Mining Strategy? American Bitcoin’s decision to increase its BTC holdings reveals several strategic insights about modern mining operations: Long-term confidence : Holding mined Bitcoin suggests belief in future price appreciation Operational efficiency : The ability to accumulate 363 additional BTC indicates strong mining performance Market timing : Choosing when to hold versus when to sell requires careful market analysis Balance sheet strength Significant BTC holdings can serve as collateral or value storage This approach contrasts with mining operations that immediately convert Bitcoin to fiat currency to cover expenses. Instead, American Bitcoin appears to be building a substantial digital asset treasury, potentially positioning itself for future opportunities in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Why Should Investors Watch American Bitcoin’s Moves? The company’s growing BTC holdings provide valuable insights for both cryptocurrency enthusiasts and traditional investors. First, it demonstrates how institutional players are approaching Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a strategic reserve. Second, the scale of accumulation—363 additional BTC—highlights the profitability potential of well-run mining operations even amid market fluctuations. Furthermore, American Bitcoin’s transparency about its holdings establishes credibility in an industry where trust matters. Regular disclosures help build confidence among stakeholders and observers alike. As more traditional companies consider cryptocurrency exposure, watching how established mining firms manage their Bitcoin reserves offers valuable lessons in risk management and strategic planning. However, challenges remain. Bitcoin mining faces ongoing concerns about energy consumption, regulatory scrutiny, and market volatility. Companies like American Bitcoin must navigate these while maintaining profitability and growing their BTC holdings. Their success or struggle will influence how other enterprises approach cryptocurrency integration. What’s Next for Bitcoin Mining and Institutional Holdings? American Bitcoin’s increased BTC holdings likely signals broader trends in cryptocurrency adoption. As institutional interest grows, we may see more companies accumulating Bitcoin as part of treasury management strategies. The mining sector itself might evolve, with successful operations becoming not just service providers but significant holders of the digital assets they help secure. The company’s next moves will be telling. Will they continue accumulating Bitcoin, or begin diversifying into other digital assets? How will they leverage their growing BTC holdings for business expansion or financial strategy? These questions matter not just for American Bitcoin, but for the entire cryptocurrency mining industry. In conclusion, American Bitcoin’s addition of 363 BTC to reach 4,367 total holdings represents more than just numbers on a balance sheet. It reflects strategic confidence in Bitcoin’s future, demonstrates mining profitability potential, and signals growing institutional comfort with cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class. As the market watches Eric Trump’s venture grow its reserves, the broader implications for Bitcoin adoption and mining economics become increasingly significant. Frequently Asked Questions How much Bitcoin does American Bitcoin now hold? American Bitcoin currently holds 4,367 BTC, representing an increase of 363 Bitcoin from their previous disclosure. Who founded American Bitcoin? The company was founded by Eric Trump, the second son of former U.S. President Donald Trump. Why would a mining company hold Bitcoin instead of selling it? Holding Bitcoin allows mining companies to benefit from potential price appreciation, use BTC as collateral, and build long-term value rather than just generating immediate revenue. What does this increase say about Bitcoin mining profitability? The ability to accumulate 363 additional BTC suggests American Bitcoin is operating profitably enough to hold assets rather than immediately converting them to cover expenses. How does this affect the broader cryptocurrency market? Large holdings by mining companies reduce immediate selling pressure on the market and demonstrate institutional confidence, potentially supporting Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Where was this information about American Bitcoin’s holdings announced? The company disclosed its updated BTC holdings through its official social media channels.

CEO Rick Wurster said the company will focus solely on these two assets in its first foray into the crypto space and is “extremely confident” about the necessary integration work. Wurster stated that the crypto trading process will proceed gradually, first testing it with company employees, then opening it to a limited group of customers, and finally offering it to all investors. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said that Schwab's move could pose a serious threat to crypto exchanges. Balchunas stated the following in his assessment: We knew this was coming. The big question: What will the fees be? Schwab offers free trading on ETFs and stocks. If they offer free crypto as well, Coinbase should be wary. Even a fee below 50 basis points is a major threat to crypto exchanges, in my opinion. Related News: BlackRock Releases Cryptocurrency Report - “This Event Will Ignite Cryptocurrencies” Balchunas also noted that spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are already free to trade, with tight spreads of 1-2 basis points, and that it would be difficult for Schwab to exceed this. However, he also noted that ETFs have expense ratios, while owning the assets directly eliminates this cost. Wurster said acquisitions are a key part of Schwab's growth strategy. “If the right opportunity comes along at the right price, we would certainly consider buying a crypto company,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

She commented, “₿ig things coming for Franklin,” posting a cartoon image of the famous anthropomorphic turtle on a Bitcoin-labelled laptop and tokens. Lately, Franklin, the Turtle memes have been associated with the American government after U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth shared an image of Franklin firing an RPG from a helicopter, labeled as a spoof book called Franklin Targets Narco Terrorists. For years, Senator Lummis has been one of Washington’s most vocal supporters of Bitcoin, frequently arguing that BTC offers long-term fiscal stability in contrast to the ballooning U.S. debt . She has previously pushed for clearer regulatory frameworks and for federal agencies to treat Bitcoin as a strategic asset rather than a speculative instrument. Some hinted that U.S. Bitcoin purchases would be game-changing In response to Lummis’ post , an X user shared that any government-backed Bitcoin purchases would need to be aware of the risks in the asset’s minimal oversight and extreme volatility. Another user commended the effort, saying, “Imagine the treasury diversifying into BTC, that’s a legendary pivot,” while another described it as game-changing. Additionally, some argued that if Washington moves to classify Bitcoin as part of its strategic reserves, G20 central banks would face a “Nakamoto Dilemma,” no longer able to avoid holding it while the U.S. accumulates. A commenter, Loco Riyad, also noted that the senator’s teasing of the possibility of federal Bitcoin holdings is a significant macro-level development. Government accumulation would elevate BTC into strategic-reserve territory and intensify supply dynamics. It also points to a policymaking environment that’s increasingly pro-Bitcoin. Texas bought nearly $5 million in Bitcoin Texas officials confirmed on Monday that the state acquired nearly $5 million in Bitcoin through an exchange-traded fund managed by BlackRock. A few months ago, Texas Gov. Abbott approved Senate Bill 21, a heavily discussed and divisive bill that allowed the state to establish a taxpayer-funded strategic cryptocurrency reserve. The transaction stands out as one of the first of its kind by a state government, when both federal and state officials are showing greater openness to the growing cryptocurrency market. States such as New Hampshire and Arizona have introduced their own crypto reserve frameworks through recent bills. Despite the enthusiasm, critics argue that using taxpayer funds to buy Bitcoin exposes states to unpredictable financial swings. Opponents of the Texas bill warned during legislative debates that Bitcoin’s volatility could jeopardize public coffers if the market were to turn sharply downward. Others questioned whether government involvement distorts private markets or undermines the principles of decentralization that underlie cryptocurrencies in the first place. Still, supporters counter that long-term scarcity and increasing institutional adoption outweigh short-term fluctuations. While Wisconsin and Michigan pension systems dipped into crypto last year, Texas stands out as the first state to directly fund a cryptocurrency reserve. Lee Bratcher, head of the Texas Blockchain Council, the pro-crypto group that backed the bill, commented, “ I think Texas staking out a leadership position will be very beneficial to Texans over time, similar to what the oil and gas industry has done over the last century. I think we’re only scratching the surface.” Bratcher claimed Texas made the purchase late last month at a price of nearly $87,000; after first hearing about it on a Zoom call that included acting Comptroller Kelly Hancock. He noted that Texas’s choice will yield advantages for decades, covering everything from workforce growth to increased tax collections.

At the same time, Gary Gensler recently repeated his long-standing warning that most cryptocurrencies lack real fundamentals, and pointed out that Bitcoin stands apart from thousands of speculative tokens. Larry Fink Admits a Major Shift on Bitcoin BlackRock chair and CEO Larry Fink used his appearance at The New York Times’ DealBook Summit to point out just how dramatically his stance on Bitcoin changed over the past decade. Speaking alongside Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Fink acknowledged that his shift from dismissing crypto as a tool for illicit finance to overseeing the largest spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States is one of the most public changes of opinion he has ever made. He recalled that in 2017, before Bitcoin’s explosive bull run, he openly linked the asset to money laundering, which actually defined much of Wall Street’s thinking at the time. Today, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) commands tens of billions in assets and quickly became a central pillar of institutional Bitcoin exposure. Fink told interviewer Andrew Ross Sorkin that his thinking is still changing as the market matures, but he pushed back against the notion that he is now fully aligned with Bitcoin’s most enthusiastic supporters. He described Bitcoin as “an asset of fear,” and pointed out that its price often slipped when global tensions appeared to ease, like during signals of progress in US–China trade relations or the possibility of de-escalation in the war in Ukraine. According to Fink, anyone treating Bitcoin like a short-term trade should expect extreme volatility and be prepared for the challenges of market timing, which he believes most investors are not equipped to do. Despite this, BlackRock’s actions show a deepening commitment to regulated crypto products. The firm secured SEC approval in January of 2024 to launch IBIT, one of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. The fund quickly grew to a peak valuation of around $70 billion, which helped cement BlackRock at the center of the institutional Bitcoin landscape. However, November brought a period of huge net outflows, with IBIT shedding more than $2.3 billion over the month, including two single-day withdrawals of more than $450 million each. Even so, BlackRock is still confident in the long-term role of ETFs. Business development director Cristiano Castro described them as “liquid and powerful instruments.” Gensler Warns Most Crypto Still Lacks Fundamentals Former US Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler also recently shared his thoughts about Bitcoin and crypto, and warned in a new Bloomberg interview that most digital assets are still “highly speculative” and lack the fundamentals investors should expect. While he acknowledged that Bitcoin sits closer to a commodity, he argued that the broader universe of tokens does not offer dividends, cash flows or traditional forms of value, leaving retail investors exposed to serious risks. Gensler explained that public enthusiasm does not replace underlying economic substance, and urged market participants to question what stands behind the thousands of tokens circulating today. His comments were made against the backdrop of a regulatory legacy that reshaped the industry. During his time leading the SEC from 2021 to early 2025, Gensler oversaw a sweeping enforcement campaign that targeted exchanges, token issuers and staking programs. Gary Gensler Some of the more high-profile actions included lawsuits against Coinbase for allegedly acting as an unregistered exchange, broker and clearing agency, as well as the move that forced Kraken to shut down its US staking program and pay a multimillion-dollar penalty. This all cemented his reputation as one of the most aggressive crypto regulators in SEC history, which drew a lot of criticism from people in the industry who accused him of stifling innovation and regulation-by-enforcement. Pressed on whether crypto has become a partisan issue, especially with references to the Trump family’s recent crypto activity, Gensler rejected the idea. He said the debate is grounded in investor protection, fairness and equal access to information—principles he believes should apply universally regardless of political alignment. In his view, the regulatory conversation is not about party lines but about ensuring that the same transparency and protections enjoyed in traditional markets extend to crypto assets. Gensler also commented on the growing role of ETFs in the economy. He argued that finance naturally gravitates toward centralization, so the shift from decentralized ideals to more integrated and centralized products like Bitcoin ETFs is not surprising. During his tenure, the SEC approved the first US Bitcoin futures ETFs, which he framed as part of a broader integration of crypto with traditional financial infrastructure. Even after leaving office, Gensler’s perspective still shapes regulatory thinking. He consistently places Bitcoin in a separate category while still sharing doubts about altcoins, and his comments will even now influence court battles, compliance strategies and institutional allocation frameworks.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-04 05:30:00

Over $240 million in leveraged positions were forcefully closed in a single 24-hour period, with a staggering majority of those crypto liquidations hitting traders who bet against Bitcoin and Ethereum. This dramatic event reveals a critical lesson about the volatile nature of futures trading and the high-stakes game of market predictions. What Exactly Are Crypto Liquidations? Before we dive into the numbers, let’s clarify what a liquidation means. In perpetual futures trading, investors use borrowed funds (leverage) to amplify their potential gains. However, if the market moves against their position, their collateral can fall below a required level. When this happens, exchanges automatically close the position to prevent further loss—this forced closure is a liquidation. It’s a sudden, often painful event that can trigger cascading price movements. The $240M Wipeout: A Breakdown of the Damage The data paints a clear and dramatic picture of where the pain was most acute. The scale of these crypto liquidations highlights a significant shift in short-term market sentiment. Bitcoin (BTC): $109 million liquidated. Short positions (bets on price drops) made up over 60% of this total. Ethereum (ETH): $131 million liquidated. Here, the story is even more extreme, with a crushing 83% of the liquidations hitting short sellers. Solana (SOL): $17.81 million liquidated. Interestingly, the dynamic flipped for SOL, where 77% of the liquidated positions were longs (bets on price increases). Why Did So Many Short Positions Get Liquidated? This pattern suggests a powerful, perhaps unexpected, upward price move for BTC and ETH. When prices rise sharply, traders who borrowed assets to sell (shorting), expecting to buy them back cheaper, face immediate losses. If they don’t add more collateral quickly, their positions get liquidated. This wave of crypto liquidations likely acted as a short squeeze, where covering these forced buys adds more fuel to the price rally, creating a feedback loop of pain for short sellers. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders What can you learn from this market event to protect your own capital? First, understand that high leverage is a double-edged sword. It can magnify profits but devastate accounts during volatility. Second, always use stop-loss orders to define your risk automatically. Third, pay attention to funding rates and market sentiment; extreme positioning often precedes sharp reversals. Managing risk is more important than chasing maximum returns. The Ripple Effect of Major Liquidations Large-scale crypto liquidations don’t happen in a vacuum. They increase market volatility and can lead to heightened fear or opportunity. Forced selling (or buying to cover) can exaggerate price swings. Moreover, events like this serve as a stark reminder of the market’s unpredictability, potentially cooling overly aggressive speculative activity in the short term while resetting leverage levels across the board. In conclusion, the recent $240 million liquidation event is a textbook example of the risks inherent in crypto derivatives trading. The overwhelming dominance of short position liquidations in BTC and ETH indicates a strong counter-trend move that caught many traders off guard. The key takeaway is clear: in the leveraged crypto arena, even being directionally correct isn’t enough if your timing or risk management is poor. Respect the market’s power, use leverage cautiously, and never risk more than you can afford to lose. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What causes a short position to be liquidated? A: A short position gets liquidated when the price of the asset rises significantly against the trader’s bet. If the loss reaches a point where their remaining collateral can’t cover the potential further loss, the exchange closes the position to prevent a negative balance. Q: Are liquidations bad for the overall market? A: They increase short-term volatility and can be painful for affected traders. However, they also help reset excessive leverage in the system, which can contribute to a healthier market foundation by removing unstable, over-extended positions. Q: How can I avoid getting liquidated? A> Use lower leverage, maintain a healthy collateral buffer above the liquidation price, employ stop-loss orders, and avoid investing essential funds. Always calculate your liquidation price before entering a trade. Q: What is a “short squeeze” mentioned in the article? A> A short squeeze occurs when a rising price forces short sellers to buy back the asset to close their positions (to limit losses or due to liquidation). This wave of buying pressure can push the price even higher, forcing more shorts to cover, creating a rapid upward spiral. Q: Why was Solana different, with mostly long liquidations? A> This indicates that SOL’s price movement during this period was likely downward or stagnant while BTC and ETH rallied. Traders betting on SOL’s price increase (longs) would have been the ones caught out and liquidated in that scenario. Found this breakdown of the recent crypto liquidations helpful?

Ju Ki-young, the CEO of leading analytics firm CryptoQuant, has issued a stark warning. He states that most Bitcoin on-chain indicators are currently showing significant weakness. This analysis suggests the market’s underlying health is deteriorating, and a full bear market could begin if macroeconomic liquidity dries up. For investors, understanding these signals is now more crucial than ever. What Are Bitcoin On-Chain Indicators Telling Us? On-chain data refers to information recorded directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. Unlike price charts, it reveals the real behavior of network participants. According to CryptoQuant’s CEO, a majority of these metrics are now painting a concerning picture. Think of them as the blockchain’s pulse and blood pressure. When they weaken, it often precedes a downturn in market sentiment and price. Key metrics under scrutiny include exchange flows, miner activity, and the behavior of long-term holders. Why Is This Bearish Signal So Critical? The warning is significant because Bitcoin on-chain indicators have a strong track record of predicting market shifts. They move beyond the noise of daily trading to show what investors are actually doing with their coins. For instance, a sustained increase in Bitcoin moving to exchanges can signal selling pressure. Currently, these fundamental metrics are aligning in a way that suggests caution. Therefore, ignoring this data could be risky for any market participant. The Macroeconomic Liquidity Threat Ju Ki-young added a crucial external factor: macroeconomic liquidity. This refers to the amount of money circulating in the global financial system. When central banks tighten policy and reduce liquidity, risk assets like Bitcoin often suffer. The CEO’s statement implies a dangerous combination: Internal Weakness: Poor Bitcoin on-chain indicators . External Pressure: A potential drain of macroeconomic liquidity. Together, these forces could be the catalyst that pushes the market from correction into a prolonged bear phase. What Should Investors Do Now? Facing bearish Bitcoin on-chain indicators doesn’t mean you should panic. Instead, it’s a call for strategic vigilance. First, review your risk management. Ensure your portfolio can withstand increased volatility. Second, use this time for research. Bear markets often create opportunities to accumulate assets at lower prices, but timing is everything. Finally, keep a close watch on both blockchain data and Federal Reserve announcements, as both will guide the next major trend. Conclusion: Navigating the Signals The message from CryptoQuant’s CEO is clear. The blockchain’s own data is signaling weakness, and the macro environment could amplify it. While not a guarantee of immediate price collapse, these Bitcoin on-chain indicators are a powerful warning light on the dashboard. Successful investors will respect this data, adjust their strategies accordingly, and prepare for a potentially tougher market environment ahead. Staying informed and agile is your best defense. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are Bitcoin on-chain indicators? They are metrics derived from data recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, such as transaction volume, wallet activity, and coin movement. They help analyze investor behavior and network health beyond just price. Which specific indicators are currently bearish? While CryptoQuant didn’t list all, typically bearish signals include increased exchange inflows (hinting at selling), declining miner reserves, and reduced activity from long-term holder wallets. Does bearish on-chain data always mean the price will drop? Not always immediately. On-chain data often leads price action. It shows underlying stress that may eventually manifest in the market, especially if combined with negative external factors like poor macro liquidity. How does macroeconomic liquidity affect Bitcoin? Bitcoin is considered a risk asset. When central banks reduce liquidity (through higher interest rates or quantitative tightening), money flows out of risky investments, which can depress Bitcoin’s price. Should I sell all my Bitcoin if indicators are bearish? Not necessarily. It’s a signal to reassess your strategy, increase caution, and potentially strengthen your risk management. It may be a time to hold rather than aggressively buy. Where can I check these on-chain indicators myself? Platforms like CryptoQuant, Glassnode, and LookIntoBitcoin provide public charts and analysis of key on-chain metrics for free. Found this analysis of Bitcoin on-chain indicators crucial?

This latest Bitcoin price analysis dives into the key technical and on-chain signals fueling this optimistic outlook. We’ll unpack the fading market fear, a crucial macroeconomic tailwind, and the precise levels that could make or break this rally. What’s Driving the Current Bitcoin Price Analysis? According to a recent CoinDesk report, BTC has overcome its previous high near $93,104. This breakout is significant because it shifts the immediate Bitcoin price analysis from neutral to bullish. The primary target now lies in the $98,000 to $100,000 resistance zone. However, a sustainable move requires supportive market conditions, and recent data provides exactly that. Is Market Fear Finally Subsiding? One of the most encouraging signs comes from the Bitcoin Volatility Index (BVIV). After an upward trend that began in September, the 30-day Implied Volatility has dropped to 48. This decline is a clear signal that the market’s anxiety is rapidly cooling off. Here’s why this matters for our Bitcoin price analysis : Lower Volatility: Often precedes periods of sustained, directional price movement. Reduced Fear: Indicates traders are less worried about sudden, sharp downturns. Negative Correlation: Spot prices and volatility have moved inversely since last November, meaning lower volatility can coincide with rising prices. Therefore, this calm could be the foundation for Bitcoin’s next major leg up. How Does the U.S. Dollar Influence This Bitcoin Price Analysis? A major macroeconomic factor adding fuel to the bullish case is the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). The DXY has resumed its downward trend. Historically, a weaker dollar tends to be positive for Bitcoin and other hard assets. Think of it this way: as the dollar’s purchasing power weakens, investors often seek alternative stores of value. This dynamic provides a powerful tailwind for BTC’s price, reinforcing the optimistic Bitcoin price analysis based on technical breakouts. What Are the Key Risks in This Bitcoin Price Analysis? While the path to $100,000 looks clearer, our Bitcoin price analysis must also account for potential pitfalls. The primary warning signal involves the Ichimoku Cloud, a comprehensive indicator that defines support and resistance. If Bitcoin’s price were to fall back below this cloud, its short-term upward momentum could significantly weaken. Traders should monitor this level closely, as a breakdown would necessitate a reassessment of the immediate bullish thesis. Conclusion: A Cautiously Optimistic Outlook In summary, the current Bitcoin price analysis paints a cautiously optimistic picture. The combination of a technical breakout above $93,104, receding market volatility, and a supportive macroeconomic backdrop creates a compelling case for a retest of the $100,000 zone. The journey may not be linear, and vigilance around key support levels like the Ichimoku Cloud is essential. However, the building blocks for a significant upward move are now in place. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Bitcoin Volatility Index (BVIV)? The BVIV measures the market’s expectation of Bitcoin’s price volatility over the next 30 days, derived from options prices. A falling BVIV suggests traders expect calmer markets ahead. Why does a weaker U.S. Dollar help Bitcoin? Bitcoin is often viewed as an asset independent of traditional finance. When the dollar weakens, it can increase the appeal of decentralized, scarce assets like Bitcoin as a hedge against currency depreciation. What is the Ichimoku Cloud? The Ichimoku Cloud is a technical analysis indicator that shows key support and resistance levels, momentum, and trend direction all at once. Price trading above the cloud is generally bullish, while trading below it is bearish. What happens if Bitcoin fails to hold above $93,104? A failure to hold this breakout level could see price retreat to seek stronger support, potentially delaying or invalidating the short-term move toward $100,000. Is now a good time to buy Bitcoin based on this analysis? This analysis highlights positive conditions but is not financial advice. Always conduct your own research, consider your risk tolerance, and potentially consult a financial advisor before making investment decisions. How reliable is the correlation between volatility and price? While the negative correlation has been consistent since late last year, all market relationships can shift. It should be one of several tools in an investor’s toolkit, not a standalone signal. Found this Bitcoin price analysis insightful?

As the AI arms race intensifies, AWS is positioning itself as the go-to platform for businesses seeking to differentiate themselves through tailored AI solutions. For cryptocurrency and blockchain companies looking to integrate sophisticated AI capabilities, these developments could unlock unprecedented opportunities for innovation and competitive advantage. Why AWS Custom LLMs Matter for Enterprise Differentiation “If my competitor has access to the same model, how do I differentiate myself?” This question, posed by AWS customers according to Ankur Mehrotra, General Manager of AI Platforms at AWS, captures the core challenge facing businesses in the AI era. The answer, AWS believes, lies in customized models. While most companies have been relying on generic AI models from providers like OpenAI and Anthropic, AWS is betting that the future belongs to specialized models trained on proprietary data and optimized for specific use cases. Amazon SageMaker’s Serverless Model Customization: A Game-Changer The centerpiece of AWS’s announcement is serverless model customization in Amazon SageMaker AI. This revolutionary feature allows developers to build and fine-tune custom large language models without worrying about compute resources or infrastructure. Imagine being able to create a specialized AI model for analyzing cryptocurrency market patterns or smart contract security without managing servers or scaling concerns. The process offers two paths: Self-guided point-and-click interface : Perfect for teams with clear requirements and labeled data Agent-led natural language experience (launching in preview): Developers can simply prompt SageMaker using conversational language to guide the customization process “If you’re a healthcare customer and you wanted a model to be able to understand certain medical terminology better, you can simply point SageMaker AI, if you have labeled data, then select the technique and then off SageMaker goes, and [it] fine tunes the model,” Mehrotra explained to Bitcoin World. Amazon Bedrock Reinforcement Fine-Tuning: Automated Excellence Complementing the SageMaker enhancements, AWS is launching Reinforcement Fine-Tuning in Amazon Bedrock. This capability allows developers to choose either a custom reward function or a pre-set workflow, and Bedrock will automatically run the entire model customization process from start to finish. For blockchain companies, this could mean creating AI models that understand DeFi protocols, NFT market dynamics, or regulatory compliance requirements with minimal technical overhead. Feature Platform Key Benefit Supported Models Serverless Model Customization Amazon SageMaker AI No infrastructure management required Amazon Nova, DeepSeek, Meta Llama Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Amazon Bedrock Automated end-to-end customization Multiple foundation models Natural Language Interface Amazon SageMaker AI Conversational model building All supported custom models The Competitive Landscape: Can AWS Gain Ground? AWS faces significant challenges in the AI model market. A July survey from Menlo Ventures revealed that enterprises strongly prefer Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini over other models. However, AWS’s focus on customization could be its secret weapon. While competitors offer powerful general models, AWS is betting that businesses will increasingly demand specialized solutions that reflect their unique data, brand voice, and operational requirements. The timing is strategic. Following Tuesday’s announcement of Nova Forge—a service where AWS builds custom Nova models for enterprise customers at $100,000 per year—these new tools represent a comprehensive approach to custom AI. For cryptocurrency exchanges, blockchain analytics firms, or DeFi platforms, the ability to create AI models that understand their specific terminology and use cases could provide a substantial competitive edge. Practical Applications: Where Serverless Model Creation Shines Consider these real-world scenarios where AWS’s new capabilities could transform operations: Cryptocurrency Trading Platforms : Custom LLMs trained on historical trading data, market sentiment, and regulatory updates Blockchain Security Firms : AI models specialized in smart contract vulnerability detection and audit processes NFT Marketplaces : Models understanding artistic styles, collector preferences, and valuation factors Enterprise Blockchain Solutions : Custom models for supply chain optimization, document verification, or compliance monitoring Challenges and Considerations While AWS’s new tools are impressive, enterprises should consider several factors: Data Preparation : High-quality labeled data remains essential for effective model customization Cost Management : While serverless reduces infrastructure concerns, model training and inference costs still need monitoring Skill Requirements : Despite simplified interfaces, AI expertise remains valuable for optimal results Vendor Lock-in : Custom models built on AWS infrastructure may be challenging to migrate elsewhere The Future of Enterprise AI: Customization as Standard AWS’s announcements signal a broader trend in enterprise AI: the shift from one-size-fits-all models to specialized solutions. As Mehrotra noted, the key to differentiation lies in creating customized models optimized for specific brands, data, and use cases. For the cryptocurrency and blockchain sector—where innovation moves at lightning speed and competitive advantages are fleeting—this approach could be particularly valuable. The implications extend beyond immediate business applications. As more companies develop custom AI models, we may see new forms of AI specialization emerge, with models becoming as distinctive as corporate branding or proprietary algorithms. This could lead to a more diverse AI ecosystem where models reflect the unique characteristics of their creating organizations. FAQs: Understanding AWS’s Custom LLM Strategy What models can be customized using AWS’s new tools? AWS supports customization of its own Amazon Nova models as well as certain open source models with publicly available weights, including DeepSeek and Meta’s Llama models. Who is Ankur Mehrotra? Ankur Mehrotra is the General Manager of AI Platforms at AWS , responsible for leading the development of AWS’s AI and machine learning services. What is Nova Forge? Nova Forge is an AWS service announced earlier at re:Invent 2025 where AWS builds custom Nova AI models for enterprise customers for $100,000 per year, providing a managed solution for companies needing highly specialized models. How does AWS’s approach differ from competitors like OpenAI? While OpenAI and Anthropic focus on powerful general-purpose models, AWS emphasizes customization tools that allow enterprises to create models tailored to their specific data and use cases. What was the Menlo Ventures survey mentioned in the article? A July survey from Menlo Ventures found that enterprises strongly prefer AI models from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google’s Gemini over other providers, highlighting AWS’s challenge in gaining market share. Conclusion: A Strategic Shift in Enterprise AI AWS’s aggressive push into custom LLM tools represents more than just feature updates—it signals a fundamental shift in how enterprises will approach artificial intelligence. By making model customization accessible through serverless infrastructure and natural language interfaces, AWS is democratizing specialized AI development. For cryptocurrency companies and blockchain innovators, these tools could accelerate the integration of AI into everything from trading algorithms to security protocols. The message is clear: in the AI era, differentiation comes not from using the same models as your competitors, but from creating models as unique as your business.

This is the promise of tokenized stocks , but a powerful Wall Street player just threw a regulatory wrench in the works. Citadel Securities has delivered a stark warning to the SEC: treat these digital assets exactly like their traditional counterparts, or risk creating dangerous gaps in investor protection. Why Is Citadel Sounding the Alarm on Tokenized Stocks? In a formal comment letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the giant hedge fund firm Citadel Securities took a firm stance. It strongly opposes any special regulatory exemptions for trading tokenized stocks on DeFi platforms. The core of their argument is simple: the function defines the rule. If a digital token represents ownership in a company and is traded for profit, it is a security—no matter what technology facilitates the trade. Citadel challenges the common DeFi claim of complete decentralization. The firm points out that many platforms have identifiable intermediaries, like developer teams or governance token holders, who profit from fees and influence how trades are processed. This, they argue, makes these entities no different from traditional market intermediaries who fall under strict SEC oversight. The Heart of the Debate: Smart Contracts vs. Traditional Rules This is where the debate gets technical, yet critical for every investor. Citadel made a pivotal argument that cuts to the core of crypto regulation. It stated that executing a trade via a smart contract is a binding contractual act, functionally identical to placing an order on the New York Stock Exchange. Therefore, exempting these transactions could dismantle key investor safeguards. Let’s break down what Citadel says could be at risk: Transparent Fee Disclosures: Investors might not fully understand the costs embedded in smart contracts. Conflict of Interest Management: Platform developers could prioritize their own profits. Market Surveillance: Manipulative trading could go undetected without proper monitoring. Secure Custody: The safety of the digital assets themselves could be compromised. Citadel insists its position is not anti-innovation. Instead, it’s a call for a level playing field . The firm asserts that tokenized stocks must follow the same rules as traditional stocks to ensure market integrity and protect everyone involved. How Does the Crypto Industry Respond to This Challenge? Unsurprisingly, pushback from the crypto and DeFi sector was swift. Critics argue that Citadel’s view shows a fundamental misunderstanding of decentralization’s purpose and mechanics. They contend that true DeFi protocols are governed by code and community, not a central entity, and thus require a new regulatory framework tailored to their unique nature. This clash represents a classic tension in technological evolution: do you fit new technology into old boxes, or build new boxes altogether? For the average person, the outcome will shape how easily and safely they can access global markets in the future. The SEC’s decision could either legitimize tokenized stocks by bringing them into the regulated fold or stifle their growth by imposing incompatible rules. What Does This Mean for the Future of Investing? The Citadel letter is more than a corporate comment; it’s a spotlight on the inevitable collision between high finance and decentralized technology. The resolution will set a precedent for how all tokenized real-world assets—from real estate to commodities—are treated. A regulated path for tokenized stocks could lead to massive institutional adoption, bringing immense liquidity and stability to crypto markets. Conversely, a lack of clear rules might keep major players on the sidelines, limiting growth and leaving retail investors exposed. The goal is a framework that fosters innovation without sacrificing the hard-won protections that make public markets trustworthy. The bottom line is clear: The debate over tokenized stocks is no longer theoretical. As giants like Citadel enter the fray, the pressure is on regulators to craft rules that are both fair and forward-looking. The future of a blended financial system depends on it. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are tokenized stocks? Tokenized stocks are digital tokens on a blockchain that represent ownership in a traditional company, like Apple or Tesla. They aim to mirror the price of the real stock and can be traded on certain crypto platforms. Why does Citadel want them regulated by the SEC? Citadel argues that because these tokens function as securities (investments in a common enterprise with an expectation of profit), they should have the same investor protections, like disclosure and surveillance, as stocks traded on traditional exchanges. What’s the main argument against Citadel’s position? Critics say true decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms are governed by code and community, not a central intermediary. They believe applying old rules to this new technology stifles innovation and misunderstands how decentralization works. How could SEC regulation affect the average crypto investor? Clear SEC rules could make tokenized stock platforms safer and more legitimate, attracting more users. However, overly strict regulation could limit access or make these investments less flexible than their decentralized origins intended. What other assets could be affected by this decision? The SEC’s approach to tokenized stocks will likely create a blueprint for other tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), such as bonds, real estate, and commodities, shaping the entire future of asset tokenization.

According to real-time data from Binance’s USDT market, BTC is currently trading at $92,962.85. This move has sent ripples through the trading community, prompting urgent questions about the market’s short-term direction. Let’s break down what’s driving this decline and what savvy investors should watch next. What Caused the Sudden Bitcoin Price Drop? Market corrections are a normal part of any asset’s lifecycle, and Bitcoin is no exception. The recent dip below $93,000 appears to be triggered by a combination of technical and macroeconomic factors. Firstly, the $93,000 level had acted as a strong support zone. Once it broke, automated sell orders likely accelerated the downward momentum. Moreover, broader market sentiment has been cautious due to external pressures, contributing to the selling pressure we see today. Is This a Buying Opportunity or a Warning Sign? For long-term holders, volatility is par for the course. However, short-term traders are now closely monitoring key levels. The current Bitcoin price action presents a classic dilemma. Is this a healthy pullback within a larger bull trend, or the start of a deeper correction? History shows that significant support breaks often lead to tests of lower levels. Therefore, the next major support to watch is around the $90,000 psychological zone. A bounce from there could signal strength, while a break could indicate further downside. Key levels every trader should know right now: Immediate Resistance: $93,500 – The level to reclaim for bullish momentum. Critical Support: $90,000 – A major psychological and technical floor. Volume Analysis: High selling volume confirms the break, while low volume suggests a possible false move. How Should Investors Navigate This BTC Volatility? Navigating these waters requires a clear strategy, not emotion. Here are actionable insights for different types of investors. For HODLers , this dip may be irrelevant if your horizon is years, not days. Dollar-cost averaging into weakness can be a prudent approach. For active traders , strict risk management is essential. Setting stop-losses and taking partial profits can protect capital. Remember, the Bitcoin price is influenced by larger narratives like institutional adoption and regulatory clarity, which remain fundamentally positive. The Bottom Line on Today’s Market Move In conclusion, the drop below $93,000 is a significant technical event that demands attention but not panic. Market structure often resets through these pullbacks, creating future opportunities. The fundamental story for Bitcoin—digital gold, hedge against inflation, and a new asset class—remains unchanged. Therefore, while the short-term Bitcoin price chart shows red, the long-term trajectory is still debated by bulls and bears. Smart investors use these moments to review their portfolios, adjust strategies, and prepare for the next move. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why did Bitcoin’s price fall below $93,000? A: The drop was likely caused by a combination of technical selling after breaking a key support level and cautious broader market sentiment. Q2: Is now a good time to buy Bitcoin? A: It depends on your strategy. For long-term investors, dips can be buying opportunities. Short-term traders should wait for confirmation of a new support level before entering. Q3: What is the next important support level for BTC? A: The $90,000 level is widely watched as the next major psychological and technical support zone. Q4: Does this price drop change Bitcoin’s long-term outlook? A> Short-term volatility does not necessarily alter long-term fundamentals. The core narratives around adoption and scarcity remain intact. Q5: How can I protect my investment during such volatility? A> Employ risk management strategies like setting stop-loss orders, diversifying your portfolio, and avoiding investing more than you can afford to lose. Q6: Where can I get reliable Bitcoin price updates? A> Use reputable cryptocurrency data aggregators and exchanges like Binance, CoinMarketCap, or CoinGecko for real-time and accurate price information.

Schwartz addressed false claims about XRP and the XRP ledger that spread in the crypto space. Some of these claims seem simple or harmless, but they shape how many people view the asset. The facts describe a system that works clearly and openly, but many observers repeat ideas that do not match reality. #XRP Myths Debunked by David Schwartz • Ripple doesn’t control the XRP Ledger • XRP can’t be minted – fixed supply (100B) • No mining, no validator rewards • XRP existed before Ripple • XRPL is public, not private • XRPL is decentralized Know the facts. pic.twitter.com/A7QgvuSNET — XRP_Cro AI / Gaming / DePIN (@stedas) December 1, 2025 Control and Supply Facts A claim suggests Ripple created XRP, which is incorrect. XRP existed before the company. The supply also stays fixed. Schwartz explained this point in the past. All XRP came into existence when the ledger launched. The asset has a fixed 100 billion token supply , and XRP_Cro noted that “XRP can’t be minted.” No one can create new units. The ledger does not support mining or any other form of token production. This design keeps the supply stable and easy to track. Some people also assume Ripple controls the ledger. XRP_Cro pushed back, stating that “ Ripple doesn’t control the XRP Ledger .” This matches what Schwartz has said for years. The network does not depend on Ripple to operate. Validators run their own servers and make their own decisions. No single group can change the rules on its own. The ledger continues to function even if Ripple takes no action. This independence matters because it influences how people trust the system. Access and Decentralization The XRP Ledger is made for the public. Anyone can explore the ledger, check transactions, or run a validator. The network does not lock users out. It does not hide activity. Decentralization is another key point. The ledger employs a consensus that brings validators into the process. Each validator chooses its own path. This prevents central control. Schwartz has previously stated that XRP is more decentralized than proof-of-work blockchains . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The lack of mining further simplifies the process. There are no validator rewards, no mining pools, and no need for specialized hardware. Transactions settle in seconds. Fees remain low even when activity rises. This makes the ledger useful for payments and other tasks that need fast results. Performance and Utility Schwartz also highlighted the speed and efficiency of the ledger. He stated that XRP moves value like the Internet moves information. Finally, the CTO reiterated that Brad Garlinghouse is the CEO of Ripple and not XRP , reaffirming the point that Ripple doesn’t control XRP. The facts remain clear. XRP has a fixed supply, an open ledger, and a decentralized structure. These points suggest a grounded view of how the system functions today.

This major investment, led by blockchain-focused giant Pantera Capital with participation from Sequoia and Samsung Next, signals strong institutional confidence in using stablecoins for real-world financial solutions. Let’s explore what this means for the future of global money transfers. Why is This Funding Round a Game-Changer for Fin? The $17 million injection is more than just capital; it’s a powerful endorsement. When heavyweight investors like Pantera Capital and Sequoia back a stablecoin firm , it validates the entire model. Fin’s core mission is to leverage stablecoins—cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar—to make cross-border payments faster and cheaper. This funding provides the fuel to scale their technology and expand their reach, potentially challenging traditional remittance corridors. Who Are the Key Investors Backing This Stablecoin Firm? The investor lineup reads like a who’s who of tech and finance visionaries. Understanding their involvement clarifies the strategic importance of this deal. Pantera Capital (Lead Investor): A pioneer in blockchain investment, their leadership shows a deep belief in Fin’s specific application of cryptocurrency. Sequoia Capital: This legendary venture firm’s participation bridges the gap between traditional high-growth tech and the crypto world. Samsung Next: The involvement of Samsung’s investment arm hints at potential future integrations with consumer electronics and payment systems. Together, this consortium offers Fin not just money, but also expertise in scaling, technology, and market access. How Will Fin Use This $17M to Transform Remittances? So, what’s the plan for the $17 million? For a stablecoin firm like Fin, the capital will likely be deployed across several critical areas to build a robust and user-friendly service. Technology and Security: Enhancing platform infrastructure, ensuring bulletproof security, and improving transaction speed. Regulatory Compliance: Navigating the complex global regulatory landscape for money transmission is costly but essential. Market Expansion: Entering new geographic regions and forming partnerships with local financial institutions. User Acquisition: Marketing to reach the millions of migrant workers and businesses that need better remittance options. What Are the Real-World Benefits of a Stablecoin Remittance Firm? For the average user, the promise of a stablecoin firm like Fin translates to tangible improvements over current systems. Traditional international wire transfers can be slow, expensive, and opaque. By using stablecoins on blockchain networks, Fin aims to offer: Lower Fees: Drastically reducing the high costs typically taken by intermediaries. Faster Settlement: Transactions that can settle in minutes or seconds, not days. Transparency: Users can potentially track their payment in real-time. Financial Inclusion: Providing services to the unbanked who have internet access but no traditional bank account. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Fin and the Stablecoin Industry? Despite the exciting funding news, the path forward isn’t without hurdles. The success of any stablecoin firm operating in remittances depends on overcoming significant obstacles. Volatile Regulation: Governments worldwide are still crafting rules for stablecoins, creating uncertainty. Market Adoption: Convincing mainstream users to trust and use crypto for daily needs remains a challenge. Banking Partnerships: Reliable on-ramps and off-ramps (ways to convert cash to crypto and back) are crucial and require traditional finance partnerships. Competition: They face competition from both other crypto startups and improving digital services from established banks and fintechs. Conclusion: A Major Step Towards Mainstream Crypto Utility The $17 million raise for the stablecoin firm Fin is a landmark moment. It demonstrates that serious investors see beyond cryptocurrency speculation to its practical utility in solving expensive, real-world problems like remittances. While challenges remain, this funding provides a formidable war chest to tackle them. The journey of Fin will be a key case study in whether blockchain technology can deliver on its promise to make global finance more accessible and efficient for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly does the stablecoin firm Fin do? Fin is a financial technology company that uses stablecoins (cryptocurrencies with stable value) to facilitate fast and low-cost international money transfers, primarily targeting the remittance market. Why did Pantera Capital lead this investment? Pantera Capital is a leading investor in the blockchain sector. Their decision to lead the round signals a strong belief in Fin’s specific business model and the broader application of stablecoins for real-world payments. Are stablecoin remittances safe? While the technology offers transparency and security features, safety depends on the specific firm’s regulatory compliance, custody solutions, and operational integrity. Users should research any service thoroughly. How quickly can Fin’s service transfer money? While exact times vary, blockchain-based transfers using stablecoins can typically settle within minutes, a significant improvement over the 1-5 business days common with traditional bank wires. Will regular people need to understand cryptocurrency to use Fin? Likely not. Companies like Fin aim to build applications where the user experience is simple—similar to a mobile banking app—hiding the complex crypto mechanics in the background. What’s the biggest hurdle for Fin’s growth? Navigating the global patchwork of financial regulations for money transmitters while building trust and adoption among consumers is considered the most significant challenge.

55331900,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=228794,1764828613,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crypto-Related Murder: Ukrainian Police Arrest Two in Shocking Student Killing in Austria,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-related-murder-arrest-austria/,"BitcoinWorld Crypto-Related Murder: Ukrainian Police Arrest Two in Shocking Student Killing in Austria In a chilling case that highlights the dark side of digital assets, Ukrainian authorities have arrested two nationals for a brutal crypto-related murder in Vienna. The victim, a 21-year-old university student, was found dead in his burned car after what appears to be a targeted assault linked to cryptocurrency theft. This tragic event raises urgent questions about security in the digital age. What Happened in This Crypto-Related Murder Case? Austrian police discovered the victim’s body inside his own vehicle, which showed signs of being set on fire. Evidence indicated severe assault before death. Most notably, investigators found the student’s cryptocurrency wallet completely emptied. The suspects, both Ukrainian nationals, fled across the border immediately after the crime. However, Ukrainian police successfully apprehended them in their home country through international cooperation. Authorities state that while the exact motive remains under investigation, the theft from the digital wallet strongly points to financial greed. This crypto-related murder represents one of the most extreme examples of cryptocurrency crimes escalating to violence. How Did This Crypto-Related Murder Unfold? The investigation reveals a disturbing sequence of events. The perpetrators allegedly tortured their victim to gain access to his cryptocurrency holdings. After obtaining the digital assets, they attempted to destroy evidence by burning both the body and the vehicle. Their cross-border escape complicated the investigation but ultimately failed due to coordinated law enforcement efforts. Key aspects of this crypto-related murder investigation include: International cooperation between Austrian and Ukrainian authorities Forensic analysis of the burned vehicle and crime scene Blockchain tracing of the stolen cryptocurrency funds Witness interviews to establish the victim’s recent activities Why Are Crypto-Related Crimes Becoming More Violent? This tragic incident isn’t an isolated case. As cryptocurrency values increase, so does the incentive for criminals to use extreme measures. Unlike traditional bank accounts with multiple security layers and reversible transactions, cryptocurrency wallets often represent: Irreversible transfers once completed Pseudonymous ownership that can be difficult to trace Global accessibility without geographic restrictions Limited recovery options for stolen funds These characteristics unfortunately make cryptocurrency holders potential targets for violent crimes. The crypto-related murder in Austria demonstrates how digital asset theft has crossed into physical violence, creating new challenges for law enforcement worldwide. What Does This Mean for Cryptocurrency Security? While blockchain technology offers financial innovation, this case highlights critical security concerns. Users must understand that protecting their digital assets requires both digital and physical security measures. Some essential precautions include: Never discussing cryptocurrency holdings publicly Using hardware wallets for significant amounts Enabling multi-signature protection where possible Keeping backup phrases completely secure and offline The crypto-related murder investigation continues as authorities work to trace the stolen funds and establish the complete timeline of events. This case will likely influence how international law enforcement approaches similar crimes involving digital assets. Conclusion: A Sobering Reminder About Digital Wealth The arrest of two suspects in this brutal crypto-related murder brings some justice to a tragic situation. However, it serves as a stark reminder that as cryptocurrency adoption grows, so does the need for increased security awareness. Both digital protection and physical safety must be priorities for anyone involved in the cryptocurrency space. International cooperation, as demonstrated between Austrian and Ukrainian authorities, will be crucial in combating these emerging forms of crime. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly happened in the Austria crypto murder case? Two Ukrainian nationals allegedly tortured and murdered a 21-year-old student in Vienna, stole cryptocurrency from his wallet, burned his body inside his car, then fled to Ukraine where they were eventually arrested. How were the suspects caught after fleeing to another country? Ukrainian police apprehended the suspects through international cooperation with Austrian authorities, demonstrating how cross-border collaboration is essential for solving cryptocurrency-related crimes. Why would murder be involved in cryptocurrency theft? Unlike traditional financial theft, accessing someone’s cryptocurrency often requires obtaining passwords or recovery phrases, which criminals may use extreme violence to acquire, especially for substantial amounts. What can cryptocurrency users do to protect themselves? Users should avoid publicly discussing holdings, use hardware wallets for significant amounts, enable additional security features, and maintain physical security awareness regarding their digital assets. Is cryptocurrency inherently more dangerous than traditional money? Cryptocurrency itself isn’t more dangerous, but its irreversible transactions and potential for substantial, portable value can make holders targets for criminals who understand these characteristics. How common are violent crimes related to cryptocurrency? While most cryptocurrency crimes involve digital theft without physical violence, cases like this demonstrate an alarming trend where substantial digital wealth can motivate extreme criminal behavior. This crypto-related murder case highlights important security issues affecting all digital asset users.

Investors are concerned that Hassett is being overly aggressive in cutting interest rates to appease President Donald Trump, according to interviews reported by Bloomberg. In November, during consultations with major banks, asset managers and the Treasury's Borrowing Advisory Committee, many market players indicated they favored names like Rick Rieder or current Fed member Christopher Waller, whose independent stance is seen as stronger. Economist Claudia Sahm said Hassett’s leadership performance depended on “which Kevin Hassett emerges,” while fund manager John Stopford offered a harsher assessment, saying the market already viewed him as “Trump’s puppet,” which risks permanent damage to the Fed’s institutional reputation. Related News: Major Management Change at Binance - Another CEO Appointed, Here's Who It Is Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced at the New York Times DealBook Summit that he wants to require 12 regional Fed presidents to have lived in their respective regions for at least three years in order to be appointed to their positions. Bessent argued that candidates who do not meet this requirement should be vetoed by the Fed Board of Governors, saying, “The president and the board have the final say on the names that regional banks can choose. So if someone hasn't lived in that region for three years, we will veto them.” Bessent, who is in the process of determining Trump's expected nominee as the new FED president for 2026, stated that the selection of many of the current regional FED presidents from outside their regions contradicts the founding purpose of the FED System. *This is not investment advice.

That’s the alarming reality Ledger, the renowned hardware wallet manufacturer, has just exposed. Their latest security research reveals that common smartphone chipsets vulnerable to a sophisticated attack could leave integrated crypto wallets wide open for theft. What Makes These Smartphone Chipsets Vulnerable? Ledger’s Donjon security team conducted tests focusing on a specific chip: MediaTek’s Dimensity 700, also known as the MT6878. This chipset is found in various consumer smartphones, including devices like the Solana Seeker. The attack method is called Electromagnetic Fault Injection (EMFI). In simple terms, attackers use precisely targeted electromagnetic pulses to disrupt and ultimately control the chip’s operation. In their test, Ledger achieved what they call “full and absolute control” over the device. For a smartphone functioning as a crypto wallet, this level of access is catastrophic. It means an attacker could potentially extract the private keys securing your digital assets, leading to irreversible fund loss. The scariest part? This isn’t a bug that can be patched. Why Can’t This Vulnerability Be Fixed? This threat stems from a fundamental design flaw within the silicon itself, not a software error. Therefore, issuing a standard operating system update is useless against it. The vulnerability is baked into the hardware. MediaTek’s response clarifies the situation: the MT6878 chipset is designed for mainstream consumer products like phones and tablets. It was never engineered to meet the rigorous security standards required for financial applications or Hardware Security Modules (HSMs), which are built to withstand physical attacks like EMFI. This revelation creates a clear divide: Consumer-Grade Chips: Optimized for performance and cost in everyday devices. Security-First Hardware: Like secure elements in dedicated hardware wallets, designed from the ground up to resist physical tampering. Is Your Crypto Wallet at Risk? Key Takeaways This news primarily affects smartphones with integrated or software-based cryptocurrency wallets. If your crypto holdings are secured on a dedicated hardware wallet from Ledger, Trezor, or similar, your private keys remain isolated in a secure chip designed to thwart such attacks. The risk is concentrated on devices that combine general-purpose computing with crypto storage. Here are the immediate actionable insights for every crypto user: Understand Your Storage: Know where your private keys are actually stored. Is it on a general-purpose smartphone chip or a dedicated secure element? Prioritize Dedicated Hardware: For significant holdings, the use of a purpose-built hardware wallet remains the gold standard for security. Assess Mobile Wallets Carefully: If you use a mobile wallet, research the security model of the specific device and application. The Bottom Line: A Stark Reminder on Security Fundamentals Ledger’s disclosure serves as a crucial, if unsettling, reminder. In the relentless pursuit of convenience, we must not compromise on security fundamentals. While smartphones offer incredible utility, entrusting them with the “keys to your financial kingdom” carries inherent risks when the underlying hardware isn’t designed for that supreme level of protection. This discovery of smartphone chipsets vulnerable to physical attacks reinforces the critical importance of using the right tool for the job—especially when that job is safeguarding your digital wealth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Does this affect iPhones or Samsung Galaxy phones? A1: Ledger’s specific test was on a MediaTek chip (MT6878). However, the broader principle applies: any smartphone using a general-purpose consumer chipset not specifically hardened against physical attacks could, in theory, be vulnerable to similar EMFI techniques. The security of Apple’s Secure Enclave or Samsung’s Knox hardware varies by model and design. Q2: If I use MetaMask on my phone, am I at risk? A2: Yes, if the MetaMask app is on a vulnerable device. The risk applies to any software wallet where the private keys are processed and stored on the main smartphone chipset, making them potentially accessible during an EMFI attack. Q3: Can a software update protect my phone? A3> No. Ledger and MediaTek confirm this is a hardware-level design flaw. Software updates cannot fix vulnerabilities in the physical silicon architecture. Q4: What is the safest way to store cryptocurrency? A4> For maximum security, use a dedicated hardware wallet. These devices store private keys in a separate, isolated secure element chip specifically designed to resist both remote and physical attacks, including EMFI. Q5: Should I stop using my Solana Seeker phone? A5> For general use, it’s fine. However, for storing non-trivial amounts of cryptocurrency, you should strongly consider moving those assets to a more secure storage solution, like a hardware wallet, and use the phone only for transactions, not long-term storage.

This surprising announcement from the Kremlin signals a potential seismic shift in how nations account for digital assets. But what does this mean for the future of international trade and crypto regulation? Why Russia Wants Crypto in Its Trade Balance Maxim Oreshkin, economic adviser to President Vladimir Putin, recently made a compelling case for integrating cryptocurrency into Russia’s official economic metrics. He argues that digital assets now represent a significant portion of the Russian economy that current accounting methods completely miss. This perspective acknowledges the growing reality that cryptocurrencies have moved beyond speculative investments to become genuine tools of international commerce. Oreshkin specifically highlighted crypto mining as what he calls an “undervalued export industry.” Russian companies increasingly use mined digital tokens to pay for imports while generating substantial revenue through token sales abroad. Therefore, excluding these transactions from official trade data creates what experts call a “digital blind spot” in economic analysis. The Practical Impact on Global Trade If Russia implements this change, it would create a powerful precedent for other nations. Currently, most countries treat cryptocurrency transactions as capital flows rather than trade activities. This distinction matters because trade balances directly influence currency values, tariff decisions, and international negotiations. Consider these potential implications: More accurate economic data: Nations would better understand their true economic position Increased crypto legitimacy: Formal recognition in trade balances would boost institutional adoption New regulatory frameworks: Governments would need clear rules for crypto import/export reporting Market transparency: Investors could make more informed decisions with complete trade data Challenges in Implementing Crypto Trade Accounting While the concept sounds straightforward, practical implementation presents significant hurdles. Cryptocurrency transactions occur on decentralized networks without traditional banking intermediaries. This makes tracking and verification more complex than conventional trade documentation. Furthermore, valuation poses another challenge. Cryptocurrency prices can fluctuate dramatically within single trading days. Should nations use daily averages, transaction-time values, or monthly means when calculating their crypto trade balance? Different approaches could yield vastly different results, potentially sparking international disputes. Privacy concerns also emerge. Many cryptocurrency users value the pseudonymous nature of transactions. Comprehensive trade reporting might require disclosure levels that conflict with these privacy expectations, creating tension between regulatory needs and user preferences. Russia’s Strategic Crypto Positioning This proposal aligns with Russia’s broader strategy to establish cryptocurrency leadership despite Western sanctions. By formally recognizing crypto in trade calculations, Russia could: Create alternative trade channels that bypass traditional financial systems Attract crypto mining operations with favorable regulatory treatment Develop new economic partnerships with crypto-friendly nations Position the ruble in relation to major cryptocurrencies rather than just traditional currencies Oreshkin’s comments suggest Russia views cryptocurrency not as a threat to traditional finance, but as a complementary system that can enhance economic resilience. This pragmatic approach contrasts with more cautious positions taken by some Western governments. What This Means for Global Crypto Adoption Russia’s potential move could accelerate cryptocurrency integration into mainstream economics worldwide. When a major economy begins treating crypto as part of its formal trade balance, other nations face pressure to follow suit or risk falling behind in economic measurement accuracy. This development particularly matters for countries with: Large crypto mining industries Significant remittance flows via digital assets Active cryptocurrency trading communities Interest in reducing dependence on traditional financial networks The conversation has shifted from whether cryptocurrencies matter economically to how best to measure their impact. Russia’s proposal represents the next logical step in this evolution. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Crypto Economics Maxim Oreshkin’s call to include cryptocurrency in Russia’s trade balance calculations marks a potential turning point for digital asset recognition. This move would validate what crypto advocates have argued for years: that digital currencies represent genuine economic activity deserving formal measurement. As nations watch Russia’s next steps, the global financial community must prepare for a new era where crypto trade balance considerations become standard economic practice. The implications extend far beyond accounting adjustments, potentially reshaping international trade relationships and financial sovereignty in the digital age. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is a trade balance? A trade balance measures the difference between a country’s exports and imports of goods and services. A positive balance (surplus) means exports exceed imports, while a negative balance (deficit) means imports exceed exports. How would crypto be valued in trade calculations? This remains an open question. Options include using exchange rates at transaction time, daily averages, or monthly means. Different valuation methods could significantly impact reported trade figures. Which countries might follow Russia’s lead? Nations with significant crypto mining operations (like Kazakhstan and Iran), those using crypto to bypass sanctions, and countries seeking technological leadership in digital assets would be most likely to consider similar approaches. Does this make cryptocurrency more legitimate? Yes, inclusion in official economic statistics represents a major step toward mainstream legitimacy. It moves crypto from the financial fringe toward recognized economic infrastructure. How would this affect cryptocurrency prices? Formal recognition in trade balances could increase institutional adoption and reduce regulatory uncertainty, potentially supporting higher valuations over the long term through increased utility and demand. What are the biggest implementation challenges? Tracking decentralized transactions, establishing valuation standards, ensuring reporting compliance, and balancing transparency with privacy present the most significant practical hurdles.

This is the revolutionary promise of WordPress’s experimental AI development tool, Telex, which has already moved from concept to real-world application. At the recent State of the Word 2025 event, WordPress Project Cofounder and Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg demonstrated how this AI coding assistant is fundamentally changing how websites are built. What is WordPress’s Telex and How Does Vibe Coding Work? Telex represents WordPress’s ambitious entry into the AI-powered development space. Described by Matt Mullenweg as a “v0 or Lovable, but specifically for WordPress,” Telex is essentially a vibe coding tool designed for the AI era. The software allows developers to generate Gutenberg blocks—the modular components that make up WordPress websites—through natural language prompts rather than traditional coding. Unlike conventional development tools that require specific syntax and programming knowledge, Telex understands developer intent and generates functional code accordingly. This approach, often called “vibe coding,” focuses on describing what you want to build rather than how to build it technically. Real-World Applications: From Price Calculators to Interactive Games Despite being labeled as experimental, Telex has already been put to practical use. During the State of the Word presentation, Mullenweg showcased several examples built by community creator Nick Hamze: Pricing Comparison Tools: Interactive web elements that previously required custom development can now be created in seconds Business Information Blocks: Real-time store hours, phone numbers, and map directions integrated directly into website headers Dynamic Content Displays: Partner logo carousels, custom pricing calculators, and Google Calendar integrations Creative Experiments: Developer Tammie Lister created a new Gutenberg block daily throughout October, including a playable ASCII version of Tetris and Halloween-themed interactive elements “Things that you used to have to hire developers for, custom software like this would have cost thousands, tens of thousands of dollars to build, even just years ago,” Mullenweg explained. “We’re now able to do in a browser for pennies. It’s kind of insane.” The Technical Foundation: Abilities API and MCP Integration Telex operates within a broader AI infrastructure that WordPress is developing. Two key components enable this functionality: Component Function Impact Abilities API Defines what WordPress can do in ways AI systems can interpret Standardizes WordPress capabilities for AI tools MCP Adapter Exposes WordPress abilities to MCP-compatible tools Enables integration with platforms like Claude and Copilot This architectural approach means WordPress can participate in AI workflows without creating separate integrations for every platform. “You can now connect a WordPress installation to popular tools like Claude, Copilot, and many other platforms that support MCP,” Mullenweg told attendees. The Future of AI-Assisted WordPress Development Looking ahead to 2026, WordPress plans to introduce benchmarks and evaluations that AI models can use to test on WordPress-specific tasks. These might include changing plugins, editing text, or manipulating the WordPress interface using browser agents. Developers are already incorporating AI into their daily workflows through tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and next-generation command-line interfaces. This integration allows for refactoring projects, searching code bases, automating tasks, and running scripts with WP CLI alongside AI agents. FAQs About WordPress’s AI Initiatives What is Telex? Telex is WordPress’s experimental AI development tool that generates Gutenberg blocks through natural language prompts, enabling faster website development. Who demonstrated Telex’s capabilities? Matt Mullenweg , WordPress Project Cofounder and Automattic CEO, showcased Telex during the State of the Word 2025 event. You can learn more about his work through Automattic . What companies are involved in WordPress’s AI ecosystem? WordPress is integrating with multiple AI platforms including Anthropic’s Claude , GitHub Copilot , and other MCP-compatible tools. How does vibe coding differ from traditional development? Vibe coding focuses on describing desired outcomes rather than writing specific code, allowing AI to handle the technical implementation details. When will Telex be widely available? While still experimental, Telex is already being used in real-world applications, with broader availability likely as the tool matures through 2026. Conclusion: A Transformative Shift in Web Development The emergence of tools like Telex signals a fundamental shift in how websites will be built and maintained. By lowering the technical barriers to creating complex, interactive web elements, WordPress is democratizing web development in ways previously unimaginable. The combination of vibe coding principles with WordPress’s massive ecosystem creates unprecedented opportunities for both developers and website owners.

Analysts are monitoring the best crypto-opportunities, and according to them, the project enters the phase where momentum may change within a very short period, particularly, since Phase 6 is already 95% occupied. There are even some early models which illustrate a potential way forward to a 30x performance assuming development milestones are achieved. What Mutuum Finance Is Constructing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently creating a decentralized system of lending based on actual on-chain operation. The protocol enables customers to borrow assets like ETH or USDT and yield by means of mtTokens. When an individual provides assets he gets to be handed over mTokens, which grow with interest payments paid by the borrowers. This provides the suppliers with a natural demand-based APY. Liquidity-adjusted flexible rate models are provided to the borrowers. Borrowing remains at a cheap price when the liquidity is high. The rates increase when there is a tightening of liquidity. The system operates also with explicit collateral rules and liquids take place whenever a position becomes unsafe. In the official account on X , the team has assured that the V1 testnet is to be released on separolia network in Q4 2025. The current version also incorporates the liquidity pool, the mtTokens, the debt-tracking system, and the liquidator bot. Halborn security is currently reviewing the core lending contracts to allow the protocol to be ready to undergo a public test run. According to analysts this definite road map is among the reasons why more people are interested in the project. Capital basis and Investors Mutuum Finance has currently raised over $19.1 million and has over 18,300 investors. According to analysts, these initial figures matter for a number of reasons. They demonstrate a high level of confidence, offer deeper liquidity upon launch, and indicators of genuine interest of the user in advance of the launch of the protocol. At the start of 2025 (when the project was kick-started) MUTM was at $0.01. The present price of $0.035 is an increase by 250%. According to analysts, this appreciation at this early presale stage indicates a steady growth which is linked to adoption as opposed to speculation. A triple increase in value before the initial launch could be taken as a sign of high underlying demand. Token Distribution The total supply of the tokens in Mutuum Finance is 4 billion. Of this, there are 1.82 billion tokens contributed to the presale which constituted 45.5% of the total supply. Over 810 million of the tokens have already been bought. Having a big portion of supply held by first mover disruptors contributes towards stability and minimizes the chances of concentrated ownership. This is among the reasons why analysts opine that Mutuum Finance may perform in a good manner once it commences trading. It also has a 24-hour leaderboard running on the project whereby the most active player of the day gets paid an amount of $500 in MUTM. This is an incentive that promotes constant movement within the community. The Mutuum Finance also supports card payments. Why Analysts Are Watching Closely One of the major strengths of the project is security. Mutuum Finance finished a CertiK audit with a 90/100 Token Scan, having been rated as one of the more favourable rated early DeFi protocols entering the market. The system is also tested before launch, and this is combined with the review of Halborn Security and the $50K bug bounty. Mutuum Finance in its turn is going to release a USD-pegged stablecoin, according to the official Roadmap milestones. It will be struck and incinerated on demand and supported by the interest of the borrowers. Analysts believe that this characteristic will aid in increasing the liquidity, borrowing markets, and long-term ecosystem development. Secure architecture projects that deem DeFi utility tend to work well post-launch. After the implementation of the stablecoin and actual borrowing demand, many analysts have come to the opinion that Mutuum Finance could achieve massive upside in the long term. Why Investors are Moving Quickly Phase 6 has now been filled 95% and there is very little extraneous supply of the same at the price of $0.035. According to several analysts, the last aspect of any phase is accelerated as buyers are eager to enlarge tokens by the time a further rise in prices is achieved. When supply goes down, there is a sense of urgency. An interest was already raised by a new whale allocation of $120K. Big buys such as this usually indicate the increasing confidence of knowledgeable investors and do cause the ripple effect of new purchasers who desire to move earlier than the next phase. Entering into V1 with audited contracts, stablecoin plan, and solid community development, Mutuum Finance could be one of the most discussed new crypto companies in 2026.

Core developers have successfully activated the Ethereum Fusaka upgrade on the mainnet, marking a pivotal moment for network scalability and efficiency. This is the first major update in seven months, and it sets the stage for a new era of predictable, biannual improvements designed to keep Ethereum at the forefront of blockchain innovation. What Exactly Is the Ethereum Fusaka Upgrade? Deployed at epoch 411392, the Ethereum Fusaka upgrade represents a coordinated hard fork—a consensus-level change to the network’s protocol. Think of it as a major software update for the entire Ethereum ecosystem. This upgrade follows the Pectra update from May and initiates a new, faster-paced development cycle where the Ethereum Foundation plans to implement such upgrades twice a year. How Does the Fusaka Upgrade Boost Ethereum’s Performance? The core objective of the Ethereum Fusaka upgrade is to enhance the network’s fundamental capacity. It achieves this through a key technical adjustment: Increased Gas Limit: The Layer 1 gas limit per block has been raised to 60 million. This single change has powerful ripple effects. A higher gas limit means each block on the Ethereum mainnet can process more transactions and data. Consequently, this directly tackles two critical user pain points: high fees and network congestion. What Are the Tangible Benefits for Users and Validators? So, what does this mean for you? The Ethereum Fusaka upgrade delivers concrete improvements. First, transaction throughput is projected to nearly double over the next year, meaning the network can handle more activity without slowing down. Second, with more space in each block, competition for inclusion decreases, which should lead to lower fee burdens for users. For validators, the upgrade improves operational efficiency. By optimizing how data is handled, it reduces the computational load, making the validation process smoother and more reliable. This strengthens the entire network’s security and stability. What Challenges Lie Ahead After This Upgrade? While the Ethereum Fusaka upgrade is a cause for celebration, it’s not without its considerations. A higher gas limit increases the size of blocks, which could potentially lead to longer synchronization times for new nodes and increased hardware requirements for validators over time. However, the Ethereum development community is actively researching solutions, such as stateless clients and further protocol optimizations, to mitigate these future challenges. Why Is This a Strategic Move for Ethereum’s Future? Implementing the Ethereum Fusaka upgrade and committing to a biannual fork schedule signals a strategic shift. It demonstrates a move towards more agile and predictable development, allowing the network to integrate improvements and respond to ecosystem needs more rapidly. This consistent evolution is crucial for maintaining Ethereum’s competitive edge against other smart contract platforms. Conclusion: A Foundation for the Next Growth Phase The successful deployment of the Ethereum Fusaka upgrade is more than just a technical milestone. It is a foundational upgrade that enhances core scalability, reduces costs, and institutes a rhythm of continuous innovation. By significantly boosting mainnet capacity, Ethereum is powerfully positioning itself to support the next wave of decentralized applications, onboard millions of new users, and solidify its role as the world’s leading programmable blockchain. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: When did the Ethereum Fusaka upgrade go live? A: It was successfully deployed on the Ethereum mainnet at epoch 411392, which occurred at 12:50 p.m. UTC. Q: How will the Fusaka upgrade affect my gas fees? A: By increasing the block gas limit to 60 million, the upgrade should reduce competition for block space, which is expected to lower average transaction fee burdens for users. Q: Do I need to do anything with my ETH or tokens? A: No. As a user holding assets on Ethereum, no action is required. The upgrade is handled at the network protocol level by node operators and validators. Q: What is the main technical change in the Fusaka upgrade? A: The primary change is the increase of the Layer 1 gas limit per block, which directly allows for higher transaction throughput. Q: How often will Ethereum have upgrades like this now? A: Starting with Fusaka, the Ethereum Foundation plans to implement coordinated hard forks approximately twice a year. Q: Does this upgrade make Layer 2 solutions like Rollups less important? A> Not at all. The Fusaka upgrade improves base layer capacity, but Layer 2 scaling solutions remain essential for achieving mass-scale adoption and ultra-low-cost transactions. They work in synergy.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy just revealed that the company’s Nvidia competitor chip, Trainium, has become a multi-billion-dollar business with over 1 million chips in production and 100,000 companies using it. This isn’t just another tech announcement—it’s a seismic shift in the cloud computing landscape that could reshape how businesses access artificial intelligence power. Can Amazon’s AI Chip Really Challenge Nvidia’s Dominance? While completely toppling Nvidia’s AI chip empire might seem impossible, Amazon has discovered there’s plenty of revenue to capture by peeling off just a portion of it. During the AWS Re:Invent conference, the company unveiled Trainium3, the next generation of its AI chip that promises four times faster performance while using less power than the current Trainium2. But the real story isn’t in future promises—it’s in the current traction that Jassy revealed on X: “Trainium2 has substantial traction, is a multi-billion-dollar revenue run-rate business, has 1M+ chips in production, and 100K+ companies using it as the majority of Bedrock usage today.” The AWS Trainium Advantage: Performance Meets Economics Amazon’s strategy follows its classic playbook: offer homegrown technology with compelling price-performance advantages. According to Jassy, the Amazon AI chip wins among AWS’s enormous roster of cloud customers because it “has price-performance advantages over other GPU options that are compelling.” This means businesses get better performance at lower costs compared to traditional GPU options in the market. The advantages of AWS Trainium include: Lower operational costs for AI model training Optimized performance specifically for AWS infrastructure Seamless integration with Amazon’s Bedrock AI development platform Scalable solutions for enterprises of all sizes Anthropic’s Massive Bet on Amazon’s Technology AWS CEO Matt Garman provided crucial insight into what’s driving this multi-billion-dollar business: Anthropic, the AI company behind Claude. In an interview with CRN, Garman revealed: “We’ve seen some enormous traction from Trainium2, particularly from our partners at Anthropic who we’ve announced Project Rainier, where there’s over 500,000 Trainium2 chips helping them build the next generations of models for Claude.” Project Rainier represents Amazon’s most ambitious AI cluster—spread across multiple data centers in the U.S. and built specifically to serve Anthropic’s skyrocketing needs. This partnership is particularly significant because: Partnership Aspect Significance Investment Relationship Amazon is a major investor in Anthropic Primary Training Partner Anthropic made AWS its primary model training partner Chip Deployment Over 500,000 Trainium2 chips dedicated to Claude development The Nvidia Competitor Landscape: Who Can Really Compete? Only a handful of U.S. companies possess all the necessary engineering pieces to attempt true competition with Nvidia in the AI GPU market . These include Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta—each with silicon chip design expertise, homegrown high-speed interconnect technology, and networking capabilities. Nvidia’s dominance isn’t just about hardware; it’s built on proprietary software ecosystems like CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) that have become industry standards. The challenges facing any Nvidia competitor include: Overcoming CUDA’s software ecosystem lock-in Matching Nvidia’s networking technology (enhanced by the 2019 Mellanox acquisition) Building equivalent developer tools and support systems Creating cost advantages significant enough to justify switching Amazon’s Clever Strategy: Interoperability Instead of Confrontation Rather than attempting a head-on assault against Nvidia’s entire ecosystem, Amazon appears to be taking a more nuanced approach. Reports suggest the next generation Trainium4 will be built to interoperate with Nvidia’s GPUs in the same system. This strategy could help Amazon peel business away from pure Nvidia solutions while avoiding the massive challenge of convincing developers to completely rewrite their AI applications for a non-CUDA environment. This approach reflects a pragmatic understanding of the cloud computing reality: most enterprises want flexibility and cost savings, not religious wars between technology standards. By offering interoperability, Amazon positions AWS as the platform where businesses can use the best of both worlds—Nvidia’s established ecosystem and Amazon’s cost-optimized alternatives. The Future of Cloud Computing and AI Infrastructure With Trainium already generating multi-billion-dollar revenue and the next generation promising even better performance, Amazon has established itself as a serious player in the AI infrastructure space. The implications for the broader AI GPU market are significant: Increased competition could drive down prices for AI compute More options for enterprises seeking to optimize AI costs Potential for specialized chips optimized for specific AI workloads Greater innovation in AI hardware as competition intensifies What makes Amazon’s position particularly strong is its existing AWS customer base. With millions of businesses already using AWS for their cloud computing needs, Amazon has a built-in market for its AI chips. These customers can seamlessly integrate Trainium into their existing AWS workflows without the friction of switching cloud providers. Conclusion: A New Era of AI Chip Competition Amazon’s revelation that Trainium has become a multi-billion-dollar business marks a turning point in the AI infrastructure wars. While Nvidia remains the dominant force, Amazon has proven there’s substantial revenue available for competitors who can offer compelling price-performance advantages. The success of Trainium demonstrates that in the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, even established giants can be challenged by well-executed alternatives that prioritize customer economics. The true test will come as Amazon scales its Trainium business and introduces interoperable solutions with Nvidia hardware. If successful, this approach could reshape the entire AI infrastructure landscape, offering businesses unprecedented choice and cost optimization in their AI initiatives.

The laws will come into effect on January 1, 2026. The newly enacted legislation will place the crypto industry under tight state controls. Regulating the Crypto Industry The Turkmen government has passed sweeping legislation that formally recognises and tightly regulates cryptocurrency activities. According to local media reports , President Serdar Berdimuhamedov signed the law, which will take effect in early 2026. The law recognises mining, issuance and initial placement of virtual assets, as well as the activities of virtual asset providers as regulated operations. It introduces licensing requirements Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules, and mandates cold-storage provisions for exchanges and custodial services. The law also prohibits credit institutions from offering cryptocurrency services and gives the state authority to halt, void, or compel refunds of token issuances. Under the legislation, crypto mining companies and mining pools must register through procedures established by the Cabinet of Ministers. Both private and industrial mining are permitted, but “hidden mining” is explicitly banned. Turkmenistan’s central bank may authorise distributed ledgers or operate its own, raising concerns that citizens could be pushed onto state-controlled and surveilled networks. The Legal Status Crypto in Turkmenistan The new law clearly defines the legal status of digital assets in the country. A virtual asset may be regarded either as an independent object of civil law or as a means of certifying property or non-property rights, including claims to other civil law objects. Cryptocurrencies will not be recognised as legal tender, currency, or securities in Turkmenistan. Instead, they are categorised into two groups—backed and unbacked assets. Regulators will define liquidity requirements, settlement rules, and emergency redemption procedures for backed cryptocurrencies. The legislation also establishes the government bodies responsible for regulating virtual assets. These include the Cabinet of Ministers, the Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance and Economy, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Energy, along with other central and local executive authorities. The Cabinet will set unified state policy and procedures for issuing, placing, and circulating digital assets, managing state procurement involving virtual assets, registering miners, and establishing the rules for the creation, operation, and reporting of crypto exchanges. Turkmenistan Looks to Diversify Its Economy Turkmenistan is a largely desert nation in Central Asia and holds the world’s fourth-largest natural gas reserves, most of which are exported to China. Its decision to legalise and regulate the crypto industry comes amid efforts to diversify its economy beyond gas. A government spokesperson recently told Reuters that the new legislation will “help attract investment and stimulate digitalization.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

A recent report reveals that a significant number of South Korean crypto exchanges are operating without the nation’s highest security certification. This news arrives as global attention on digital asset safety intensifies, raising critical questions for investors about where they choose to trade. What is the ISMS-P Certification and Why Does It Matter? The Information Security Management System-Personal (ISMS-P) is South Korea’s top-tier security benchmark. It goes far beyond basic IT checks, enforcing stringent, specific protocols for how companies must protect user data. Think of it as the difference between a standard lock and a bank vault. For South Korean crypto exchanges , obtaining this certification is a powerful signal of their commitment to safeguarding customer funds and personal information from sophisticated cyber threats. How Widespread is This Security Shortfall? The findings, sourced from the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA), paint a concerning picture. Among the group of six exchanges that recently passed a regulatory review but do not support Korean won trading, a staggering five hold only the basic ISMS certification. More surprisingly, the issue extends to major players. Gopax, a well-known exchange that does support won trading, has also not acquired the elite ISMS-P certification. This situation exists despite a history of security breaches that have shaken public trust. Professor Hwang Seok-jin of Dongguk University points to incidents like the Upbit hack as events that have heightened user anxiety. He argues that exchanges must proactively bolster their defenses beyond the legal minimums. What Should Exchanges Do to Rebuild Trust? Security experts are calling for immediate and visible action from the industry. The path forward for South Korean crypto exchanges involves more than just checking compliance boxes. Key recommendations include: Pursue ISMS-P Certification: Treating this top-level certification not as an optional goal but as a fundamental requirement for operation. Separate Key Roles: Ensuring the roles of Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) are held by different individuals to prevent conflicts of interest and strengthen oversight. Transparent Communication: Clearly communicating security postures and improvements to users, rather than hiding behind technical jargon. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors in South Korea? For the everyday user, this news serves as a crucial reminder. The brand name or trading volume of an exchange does not automatically equate to robust security. Before depositing funds, investors must conduct their own due diligence. Checking an exchange’s official certifications, like ISMS-P status, should be a non-negotiable first step. The security of your digital assets depends on the integrity of the platform you choose. The Road Ahead for Exchange Security The pressure on South Korean crypto exchanges to elevate their security game is mounting from all sides. Regulators are tightening scrutiny, users are becoming more savvy, and the threat landscape is constantly evolving. Exchanges that view top-tier security as a core competitive advantage, not a cost center, will be the ones that survive and thrive. The current gap presents both a stark warning and a clear opportunity for the industry to rebuild the foundational trust that the crypto ecosystem requires. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the difference between ISMS and ISMS-P certification? A1: ISMS is a basic information security management certification. ISMS-P is a higher, more stringent level that includes specific, rigorous requirements for the protection of personal data, making it the gold standard for security in South Korea. Q2: Is ISMS-P certification legally required for crypto exchanges to operate? A2: Currently, it is not a strict legal requirement for all exchanges. However, experts and regulators strongly advocate for it as a critical measure to protect users, and it may become a de facto requirement for maintaining customer trust and regulatory approval. Q3: Which major South Korean exchange was mentioned as lacking ISMS-P? A3: The report specifically noted that Gopax, a major exchange that supports Korean won trading, has not yet acquired the ISMS-P certification. Q4: How can I check if my crypto exchange has ISMS-P certification? A4: You should visit the official website of the exchange and look for a security or compliance section. Reputable exchanges will transparently display their certifications. You can also refer to official announcements from the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA). Q5: Why is separating the CISO and CPO roles important? A5: Separating these roles ensures independent oversight. The CISO focuses on technical security defenses, while the CPO focuses on data privacy laws and user rights. Keeping them distinct prevents conflicts of interest and creates a stronger system of checks and balances. Q6: Has there been a major security breach in South Korea that highlights this need? A6: Yes. The report references security breaches at major companies, including the cryptocurrency exchange Upbit. Such incidents have significantly increased public concern and underscore the urgent need for enhanced security protocols.

This strategic reserve is specifically designed to navigate the potential turbulence of a Bitcoin bear market , showcasing a level of corporate preparedness rarely seen in the volatile crypto space. Let’s break down what this means for the company and the broader market. Why is MicroStrategy Preparing for a Bitcoin Bear Market? According to an analysis by CryptoQuant senior analyst Julio Moreno, MicroStrategy raised these funds earlier this week. The primary goal is to cover operational costs like preferred stock dividends and debt interest payments for the next 12 to 24 months. This proactive step insulates the company’s core Bitcoin treasury strategy from short-term price pressure. Therefore, even if a prolonged Bitcoin bear market unfolds, MicroStrategy can continue its holding strategy without being forced to sell its BTC assets. What Does This $1.4B Move Tell Us About Market Outlook? Moreno’s analysis suggests the current Bitcoin bear market phase began in early June. However, this preparation isn’t necessarily a prediction of doom. Instead, it’s a masterclass in risk management. The company is acknowledging cyclical volatility while maintaining a long-term bullish thesis. Moreno himself projects Bitcoin could trade between $55,000 and $70,000 next year, indicating this phase may be a consolidation period rather than a catastrophic decline. MicroStrategy’s strategy offers several key insights for observers: Institutional Maturity: Moving beyond speculative trading to structured, long-term capital allocation. Risk Mitigation: Separating treasury asset growth from operational liquidity needs. Strategic Confidence: The move signals a commitment to hold through volatility, not abandon the Bitcoin thesis. How Can Other Investors Learn from This Strategy? While few have MicroStrategy’s resources, the principles are universally applicable. Preparing for a Bitcoin bear market is not about timing the market perfectly, but about ensuring your financial runway is secure. For individual investors, this translates to: Never investing more than you can afford to hold through a downturn. Having separate emergency funds so you aren’t forced to sell assets at a loss. Viewing market cycles as expected events, not emergencies. Moreover, this action reinforces Bitcoin’s evolving narrative as a corporate treasury asset, not just a retail trading instrument. It demonstrates a sophisticated approach to managing the asset’s inherent volatility. What’s the Bottom Line for the Crypto Market? MicroStrategy’s $1.44 billion preparation is a landmark moment. It shows that serious players are building for the long haul, equipped to handle the stresses of a Bitcoin bear market . This level of planning could reduce panic-driven sell pressure from major holders, potentially leading to a more stable market foundation. The move underscores a critical shift: the smart money isn’t just buying Bitcoin; it’s building robust systems to keep it, no matter the short-term weather. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a Bitcoin bear market? A: A Bitcoin bear market is a prolonged period where prices decline significantly, typically by 20% or more from recent highs, often accompanied by widespread pessimism. Q2: Why did MicroStrategy raise cash instead of buying more Bitcoin? A: The company raised cash to cover upcoming financial obligations (dividends, debt interest). This ensures it won’t be forced to sell its existing Bitcoin holdings to pay bills if prices drop during a bear market. Q3: Does this mean MicroStrategy is no longer bullish on Bitcoin? A: Quite the opposite. This is a defensive move to protect its long-term Bitcoin strategy. By securing operational costs, it can hold its BTC treasury through volatility without disruption. Q4: How long does a typical Bitcoin bear market last? A: Historically, Bitcoin bear markets have varied in length, often lasting several months to over a year. They are a normal part of the market cycle. Q5: Should I sell my Bitcoin if a bear market is coming? A: That depends on your individual strategy and financial goals. MicroStrategy’s move highlights the importance of having a plan and sufficient reserves to avoid forced selling during downturns. Q6: Where did MicroStrategy get the $1.44 billion? A: The company raised the funds through a convertible debt offering earlier in the week, a common method for corporations to raise capital.

The digital asset briefly approached $94,000 during the rally before settling at $93,079 at the time of writing. BTC price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap Market analysts suggest the worst may be over. Bitfinex research indicates that extreme deleveraging and capitulation among short-term holders have created conditions favorable for stabilization. The selling pressure that characterized recent weeks shows signs of exhaustion. The cryptocurrency market underwent significant cleansing on October 10 when approximately $19 billion in overleveraged positions were liquidated. This event triggered a sustained downturn that pushed Bitcoin to $82,000 by November 21. The market has since recovered over 11% from that local bottom. Reduced Leverage Creates Stability The current market structure differs substantially from previous periods of volatility. Bitcoin now operates on what analysts describe as a leaner leverage base. This reduction in borrowed capital diminishes the risk of cascading liquidations that have historically caused sharp price drops. Bitfinex analysts emphasize that remaining leverage appears well-contained. The market's systemic fragility has decreased, improving prospects for a sustained consolidation phase. Investors who survived the recent shakeout tend to hold stronger positions with less debt exposure. The October liquidation event effectively cleared weak hands from the market. Long positions built on excessive leverage were forced to close, leaving behind a more resilient base of holders. This process, while painful, typically precedes more stable price action. Traditional Cycle Patterns Face Questions The late-year price correction has prompted debate about Bitcoin's four-year cycle theory. This framework historically aligned Bitcoin's peak prices with halving events and subsequent years. Many observers expected the October all-time high of $125,100 to mark the peak of the current cycle. However, market behavior suggests that traditional patterns may no longer be applicable. Bitcoin analyst PlanC stated the current cycle differs fundamentally from previous ones. The analyst has maintained this position for over a year, urging followers to recognize evolving market dynamics. December's performance will be crucial in determining whether seasonal trends remain relevant. Historical data show modest gains of 4.69% in December since 2013. Yet November defied expectations by declining 17.67% despite being statistically Bitcoin's strongest month, with average returns exceeding 41%.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-04 07:49:28

This vision is now closer to reality. A new stablecoin payments app named Fin has just secured a massive $17 million in funding, signaling strong investor confidence in the future of crypto-powered finance. Built by a former Citadel engineer, this project aims to bridge the gap between digital currency utility and everyday business transactions. What Is The Fin Stablecoin Payments App? Fin is a specialized application under development designed to let businesses send and receive payments using stablecoins. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, stablecoins are digital assets pegged to stable reserves like the US dollar. Therefore, they offer the speed and innovation of blockchain without the price swings. The stablecoin payments app focuses on creating a seamless experience for companies, potentially reducing fees and settlement times from days to seconds. Who Is Backing This Ambitious Project? The $17 million funding round is a major vote of confidence. It was led by an all-star lineup of venture capital firms deeply embedded in technology and crypto. Key participants include: Pantera Capital: A premier investment firm focused exclusively on blockchain assets. Sequoia Capital: A legendary Silicon Valley venture firm behind companies like Apple and Google. Samsung Next: The venture arm of the tech giant, investing in cutting-edge innovation. This backing combines crypto-native expertise with traditional tech venture prowess, providing Fin with capital, credibility, and a powerful network. Why Is a Stablecoin Payments App a Game-Changer? Current business payment systems, especially for cross-border transactions, are often slow and expensive. They involve multiple intermediaries, currency conversion fees, and can take several days to settle. A dedicated stablecoin payments app tackles these pain points head-on. Speed: Transactions on blockchain networks can settle in minutes or seconds. Cost Reduction: By cutting out intermediaries, transaction fees can be significantly lower. Accessibility: It opens global markets, allowing businesses to pay international partners or freelancers with ease. Transparency: Every transaction is recorded on an immutable ledger, simplifying accounting and audits. The pilot program launching next month will be the first real-world test of these benefits for select businesses. What Are the Next Steps for Fin? The team, spearheaded by a former engineer from the hedge fund Citadel, is now poised for its next phase. The immediate plan is to launch a controlled pilot program within the next month. This pilot will involve a select group of businesses, allowing Fin to gather crucial feedback, stress-test its systems, and refine the user experience before a broader public launch. The substantial funding will be used for talent acquisition, further technical development, and compliance infrastructure to ensure the stablecoin payments app meets regulatory standards. What Challenges Lie Ahead? Despite the excitement, the path forward has hurdles. Regulatory clarity for stablecoins and crypto payments is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Furthermore, Fin must convince businesses to adopt a new financial technology, which often requires changing established habits. Security will also be paramount; the app must guarantee the safety of user funds against digital threats. Success will depend not just on technology, but on navigating this complex landscape. In conclusion, Fin’s $17 million funding round is more than just a financial headline. It is a significant marker in the maturation of cryptocurrency from a speculative asset to a practical tool for commerce. By focusing on the real-world utility of stablecoins for business payments, Fin has attracted top-tier investors and positioned itself at the forefront of a potential financial revolution. The coming months, starting with its pilot launch, will reveal if this stablecoin payments app can deliver on its transformative promise and change how businesses move money forever. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a stablecoin? A: A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to have a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. This makes it suitable for payments, unlike more volatile cryptocurrencies. Q2: How is Fin different from other payment apps like PayPal or Venmo? A: While PayPal and Venmo use traditional bank rails, Fin’s stablecoin payments app uses blockchain technology. This can potentially enable faster settlement, especially for international transfers, and lower fees by reducing intermediaries. Q3: When will the Fin app be available to the public? A: Fin is first launching a pilot program with select businesses in the next month. A general public launch date will likely depend on the results and learnings from this initial pilot phase. Q4: Who are the main investors behind Fin? A: The $17 million funding round included major investors like Pantera Capital, Sequoia Capital, and Samsung Next, indicating strong institutional belief in the project. Q5: Is using a stablecoin payments app safe? A: Safety depends on the app’s security architecture. Reputable projects like Fin, backed by major VCs, will prioritize enterprise-grade security, but users should always practice good digital hygiene and understand the technology’s risks. Q6: Can any business use Fin? A: Initially, access will be limited to participants in the pilot program. The goal is to eventually onboard a wide range of businesses, but this will be a gradual process following the pilot. Found this deep dive into the future of business payments insightful?

The firm submitted a letter to the SEC on Tuesday, arguing that DeFi developers, smart-contract coders, and self-custody wallet providers should not receive “broad exemptive relief” for facilitating trading of tokenized US equities. Citadel claimed that these platforms likely fall under the definitions of an “exchange” or “broker-dealer” and must comply with securities laws if offering tokenized stocks. Regulatory Concerns and Crypto Backlash The firm warned: “Granting broad exemptive relief to facilitate the trading of a tokenized share via DeFi protocols would create two separate regulatory regimes for the trading of the same security.” “It would be the exact opposite of the ‘technology-neutral’ approach taken by the Exchange Act.” The letter was submitted as part of the SEC’s request for feedback on tokenized stock regulation. It quickly drew strong reactions from the crypto community. Lawyer and Blockchain Association board member Jake Chervinsky remarked on Thursday: “Whoever thought Citadel would be against innovation that removes predatory, rent-seeking intermediaries from the financial system?” He added: “Oh, right, literally every single person in crypto.” Industry Voices Warn Against Overreach Uniswap founder Hayden Adams said: “It makes sense the king of shady TradFi market makers doesn’t like open source, peer-to-peer tech that can lower the barrier to liquidity creation.” Summer Mersinger, CEO of the Blockchain Association, criticized the approach, stating: “Regulating software developers as if they were financial intermediaries would undermine US competitiveness, drive innovation offshore, and do nothing to advance investor protection.” She urged the SEC to focus on actual intermediaries who stand between users and their assets. SIFMA’s Position The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association echoed concerns over DeFi carve-outs. While supporting innovation, SIFMA stressed that tokenized securities must adhere to the same investor protections applied to traditional finance. Citadel had previously told the SEC’s Crypto Task Force in July that tokenized securities must provide “real innovation and efficiency to market participants, rather than through self-serving regulatory arbitrage.”",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-12-04 07:52:37

Major exchange Bithumb revealed it will delist BAL , the native token of the Balancer protocol, starting January 5, 2026. This decision follows a comprehensive review and marks another instance of exchanges tightening their listing standards. For BAL holders on the platform, understanding the timeline and implications is crucial. Why Is Bithumb Delisting BAL? Bithumb’s decision to delist BAL stems from a formal review process. The exchange designated BAL as an “investment warning asset” earlier. According to their official statement, materials submitted by the Balancer foundation were insufficient to resolve the underlying issues . The exchange evaluated the project’s future business plans and security measures, concluding that BAL no longer meets their continued listing criteria. This move highlights the increasing scrutiny exchanges apply to listed assets. Regulatory pressure and a focus on investor protection drive these decisions. Therefore, projects must maintain transparent communication and robust fundamentals to retain their exchange listings. What Is the Official Delisting Timeline? Bithumb provided clear dates for the BAL delisting process. Trading support for Balancer will end precisely at 6:00 a.m. UTC on January 5, 2026 . However, the exchange will continue supporting BAL withdrawals for one additional month, until February 4, 2026 . This grace period is standard practice. It gives users adequate time to manage their assets without facing a sudden liquidity cutoff. If you hold BAL on Bithumb, you should note these key deadlines: January 5, 2026: All BAL trading pairs (BAL/KRW, etc.) will be suspended. February 4, 2026: Final deadline for withdrawing BAL tokens from your Bithumb wallet. How Does This Affect BAL Investors? The immediate effect of Bithumb’s decision to delist BAL is reduced accessibility for South Korean traders. Bithumb is a major gateway to the crypto market in the region. Consequently, its removal could impact local trading volume and liquidity for the token. However, Balancer (BAL) remains listed on numerous other global exchanges. The protocol itself, an automated portfolio manager and liquidity provider on Ethereum, continues its operations. Investors should distinguish between an exchange’s specific listing decision and the fundamental health of the underlying project. What Should Current BAL Holders Do? If you hold BAL on Bithumb, you have clear, actionable steps to follow. First, do not panic . You have over a year before trading stops and additional time for withdrawals. Use this period to make an informed decision. Your primary options are: Sell your BAL for KRW or another cryptocurrency on Bithumb before January 5, 2026. Withdraw your BAL tokens to a private, self-custody wallet (like MetaMask) or to another supporting exchange before February 4, 2026. Always prioritize moving your assets to a secure wallet you control. This ensures you retain access regardless of future exchange decisions. What Does This Mean for Crypto Listings Overall? Bithumb’s move to delist BAL reflects a broader industry trend. Exchanges are becoming more selective, often acting as de-facto regulators. They now regularly de-list tokens that pose potential risks or fail to demonstrate ongoing compliance and development. For the crypto ecosystem, this can be a positive development. It encourages higher project standards and better investor protection. However, it also introduces uncertainty for tokens that may face similar reviews. As an investor, diversifying across exchanges and using self-custody for long-term holdings is a prudent strategy. Conclusion: Navigating Exchange Decisions The announcement that Bithumb will delist BAL is a reminder of the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets. Exchange listings are not permanent. While this specific action is targeted and follows a review process, it underscores the importance of staying informed about the platforms where you hold assets. By understanding the timeline, knowing your options, and prioritizing asset security, you can navigate these changes effectively. The key takeaway is to be proactive, not reactive, with your cryptocurrency portfolio management. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still trade BAL on Bithumb after January 5, 2026? A: No. All trading for BAL will be permanently suspended on Bithumb as of 6:00 a.m. UTC on January 5, 2026. Q2: What happens if I don’t withdraw my BAL by February 4, 2026? A: After the withdrawal deadline, you may lose access to your BAL tokens held on Bithumb. It is critical to move them before this date. Q3: Is the Balancer protocol shutting down? A: No. Bithumb’s decision is specific to their exchange. The Balancer protocol and its BAL token continue to operate and are listed on many other exchanges worldwide. Q4: Why did Bithumb label BAL as a warning asset? A: While not fully detailed, the exchange cited concerns that the Balancer foundation’s submissions were insufficient regarding future business plans and security, leading to the warning and subsequent delisting. Q5: Where can I trade BAL after Bithumb delists it? A: BAL is available on numerous other centralized and decentralized exchanges, such as Binance, Coinbase, and Uniswap. Always verify current listings. Q6: Should I sell my BAL because of this news? A: This is a personal investment decision. Consider the project’s fundamentals, your investment strategy, and the fact that one exchange’s delisting does not determine a token’s overall value.

Ethereum just delivered a powerful 7% surge in just 24 hours, smashing through the $3,200 resistance level. This explosive move follows the recent Fusaka upgrade, and analysts are now making a bold Ethereum price prediction : if this momentum continues, ETH could potentially reach $4,262. But what’s driving this optimism, and should investors prepare for further gains? What’s Behind This Bullish Ethereum Price Prediction? The cryptocurrency market reacted immediately to Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade on December 3rd. According to BeInCrypto’s analysis, the current price action mirrors the market’s response to the Pectra upgrade in May. During that previous upgrade event, ETH experienced a remarkable 56% rally over just seven days. If history repeats itself with similar percentage gains from current levels, the Ethereum price prediction of $4,262 becomes mathematically plausible. Technical analysts point to several factors supporting this optimistic outlook: Strong breakout above key resistance at $3,200 Increased trading volume accompanying the price surge Positive market sentiment following successful network upgrades Historical precedent of post-upgrade rallies Could This Rally Face Immediate Challenges? However, every Ethereum price prediction must consider potential obstacles. BeInCrypto’s technical analysis reveals that $3,200 now serves as the first critical support level. A drop below this threshold could weaken the current market structure and potentially invalidate the bullish scenario. Market participants should watch this level closely, as it represents the line between continued upward momentum and potential correction. The cryptocurrency market remains notoriously volatile, and several factors could impact this Ethereum price prediction : Broader market conditions and Bitcoin’s performance Regulatory developments affecting the crypto sector Network adoption metrics following the Fusaka upgrade Macroeconomic factors influencing risk assets How Should Investors Approach This Ethereum Price Prediction? While the $4,262 Ethereum price prediction generates excitement, prudent investors should consider both opportunities and risks. The similarity to May’s Pectra upgrade rally provides historical context, but past performance never guarantees future results. Successful cryptocurrency investing requires balancing optimistic projections with realistic risk management. Here are actionable insights for navigating this market situation: Monitor the $3,200 support level – This represents a key technical threshold Watch trading volume – Sustained high volume supports continued momentum Consider dollar-cost averaging – This strategy reduces timing risk in volatile markets Set clear exit strategies – Define profit-taking and stop-loss levels in advance What Does This Mean for Ethereum’s Future? The Fusaka upgrade represents more than just a potential price catalyst. Each successful network enhancement strengthens Ethereum’s fundamental value proposition. The platform continues evolving to address scalability, security, and efficiency challenges. While short-term price movements capture attention, these technological improvements contribute to Ethereum’s long-term viability as a leading blockchain platform. This latest Ethereum price prediction reflects growing confidence in the network’s development trajectory. However, investors should remember that cryptocurrency markets combine technological innovation with speculative trading. The path to $4,262, if it materializes, will likely include volatility and corrections along the way. Conclusion: Balancing Optimism with Practical Strategy The analyst’s $4,262 Ethereum price prediction presents an exciting possibility for ETH holders. The immediate 7% surge following the Fusaka upgrade demonstrates real market momentum. However, the $3,200 support level now becomes crucial for maintaining bullish structure. Successful investors will watch this technical level while considering the upgrade’s fundamental implications for Ethereum’s ecosystem. Remember that all price predictions involve uncertainty, especially in rapidly evolving cryptocurrency markets. The most effective approach combines awareness of bullish possibilities with disciplined risk management. Whether ETH reaches $4,262 or encounters resistance earlier, understanding both the opportunities and challenges will serve investors best. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Fusaka upgrade and why does it matter? The Fusaka upgrade is Ethereum’s latest network enhancement implemented on December 3rd. These upgrades typically improve network performance, security, or functionality, which can positively impact market sentiment and potentially influence price action. How reliable are cryptocurrency price predictions? Cryptocurrency price predictions are educated estimates based on technical analysis, historical patterns, and market fundamentals. They provide potential scenarios rather than guarantees, as crypto markets remain highly volatile and influenced by numerous unpredictable factors. What was the Pectra upgrade mentioned in the analysis? The Pectra upgrade occurred in May and triggered a 56% ETH price rally over seven days. Analysts reference this historical precedent when making current predictions, noting similar market reactions to successful network upgrades. Why is the $3,200 level so important for Ethereum’s price? The $3,200 level represents a key technical threshold. Previously acting as resistance, it now serves as support. A sustained break below this level could indicate weakening bullish momentum, while holding above it supports continued upward movement. Should I invest based on this price prediction alone? Never make investment decisions based solely on price predictions. Consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and conduct thorough research.

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin rebounded nearly 8% as analysts flagged signs that a local bottom may be forming. Bitfinex points to “seller exhaustion” after a $19 billion leverage flush reduced market risk. Opinions are split on the cycle, with some saying this run no longer follows past four-year patterns. In a note released Tuesday, Bitfinex said the market is showing “seller exhaustion” following a period of heavy deleveraging and panic-driven exits by short-term holders. “The combination of extreme deleveraging, capitulation among short-term holders, and early signs of seller exhaustion has created the conditions for a stabilisation phase and a relief bounce,” the firm wrote. Bitcoin Jumps Toward $94K After $19B Leverage Flush, Bitfinex Says The comment preceded a rally on Wednesday that briefly carried Bitcoin toward $94,000. At the time of publication, the asset was trading near $91,440, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitfinex also argued the market is now operating on a “leaner leverage base,” reducing the risk of sweeping liquidations. That shift follows a violent correction in October, when roughly $19 billion was flushed out of what traders had widely described as an overleveraged setup. The rout triggered a broader downturn that pushed Bitcoin to lows around $82,000 in late November. With excess risk wrung out, the exchange said the remaining leverage appears more contained, easing pressure on prices and improving the odds of a steadier consolidation phase. The late-year bounce is also feeding debate over whether Bitcoin’s well-known four-year cycle is losing relevance. Under older models, the cycle’s top might already have passed in October, when prices printed record highs near $125,100. However, the recent rebound has complicated that narrative, with some market watchers arguing the structure of this cycle looks different from its predecessors. Seasonal patterns offer little clarity. December has historically been one of Bitcoin’s quieter months, delivering an average gain of 4.69% since 2013, figures from CoinGlass show. Notably this year has already broken with tradition. November, typically the strongest month, closed with a steep loss of more than 17%. Several analysts remain constructive. Market commentator PlanC wrote on X that “this Bitcoin cycle is NOT like past cycles,” while trader Quinten Francois said the asset is now “closer to the bottom than to the top.” This Bitcoin cycle is NOT like past cycles. I have been warning you all and explaining this for well over a year now. Hopefully, you were paying attention. — PlanC (@TheRealPlanC) December 4, 2025 Cathie Wood Calls Liquidity Rebound for Crypto As reported, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood has forecasted that the liquidity squeeze hitting crypto and AI markets will reverse within weeks , driven by three Federal Reserve policy shifts expected before year-end. Her firm continues aggressively buying crypto equities during the downturn, deploying over $93 million in a single day this week across beaten-down digital asset stocks. Speaking during ARK’s November market webinar, she identified three temporary liquidity constraints she expects to ease rapidly through Federal Reserve action and reopened government spending. Wood expects the Federal Reserve to end quantitative tightening at its December 10 meeting, immediately easing one pressure point. The government shutdown that caused the Treasury General Account cash buildup has concluded, returning funds to circulation.

Amid mounting concerns within the crypto community, Michael Saylor confirmed that the company is in discussions with MSCI regarding its potential exclusion from the provider’s indices. Michael Saylor Weighs In On Exclusion Concerns MSCI has stated that by January 15, it will decide whether to remove companies whose business models focus on purchasing cryptocurrencies, amid concerns that these firms resemble investment funds, which are currently ineligible for index inclusion. Reuters reported that Saylor acknowledged the discussions with MSCI but expressed skepticism regarding JPMorgan’s projections of potential outflows. He commented, “It won’t make any difference, in my opinion,” regarding the implications of a possible exclusion. Saylor noted that the equity associated with Strategy is inherently volatile due to its significant reliance on Bitcoin’s (BTC) price. He cautioned, “If Bitcoin falls 30% or 40%, then the equity is going to fall more, because the equity is built to fall.” Currently, Strategy operates with a leverage ratio of 1.11, and Saylor indicated that the company could withstand a steep decline of 95% in Bitcoin prices . Reports from NewsBTC indicated that Saylor Strategy’s position emphasizing that it is not merely a passive Bitcoin holding entity. Instead, he highlighted that the company functions as a software firm with a proactive financial strategy, countering the narrative surrounding MSCI’s concerns. Strategy Establishes New USD Reserve The recent fluctuations in Bitcoin prices have reignited fears of a potential bear market, raising questions about whether Strategy would consider selling some of its substantial Bitcoin reserves, currently exceeding 650,000 coins. This speculation intensified after Strategy CEO Phong Le addressed the possibility of selling some holdings during an interview on the “What Bitcoin Did” podcast. Le stated that if the company’s stock trades below the value of its Bitcoin holdings and it is unable to raise additional capital for preferred dividends, a sale might become unavoidable. “If the stock trades below the value of our Bitcoin, then mathematically we would have to sell some Bitcoin. It would be the last resort,” he explained. To support this vision, the Virginia-based company recently announced the establishment of a $1.44 billion reserve fund allocated for dividend payments on preferred stock and to meet its debt obligations. The newly created reserve is funded through proceeds from its at-the-market stock offering. The company aims to maintain a balance sufficient to cover at least 12 months of dividends, with ambitions to extend this coverage to 24 months or more in the future. Saylor remarked, “Establishing a USD Reserve to complement our BTC Reserve marks the next step in our evolution. We believe it will better position us to navigate short-term market volatility while delivering on our vision of being the world’s leading issuer of Digital Credit.” At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading just above $93,000, marking a 4.5% increase over the past 24 hours. MSTR, the stock of the investment firm Strategy, traded up 2% in the premarket.

According to the figures shared, ETF clients purchased $89.65 million worth of XRP, bringing total ETF-held net assets to $723.05 million. Amonyx described the update as bullish and presented it as a meaningful indicator of institutional positioning. What the New Inflows Suggest The scale of the reported purchase shows that large investors continue to use ETFs as a preferred method for gaining exposure to XRP. Adding nearly $90 million in a single period represents a considerable increase in ETF demand and contributes to a total that now exceeds $700 million. For many institutional participants, ETFs remain an efficient structure because they offer regulated access, professional custody, and simplified reporting compared to holding the asset directly. This makes sizable entries into the market more practical for firms bound by compliance and risk-management requirements. JUST IN: ETF clients buy $89.65 million worth of $XRP , bringing total ETF-held net assets to $723.05 million. Bullish pic.twitter.com/aYoCwdvvrw — Amonyx (@amonbuy) December 2, 2025 Market Effect and Liquidity Considerations Rising XRP ETF holdings can influence the broader market by shifting the amount available for active trading. When ETFs absorb large amounts of the supply, those tokens often move into long-term custody, which can alter liquidity conditions over time. Higher ETF exposure can also shape how traditional financial participants view XRP, since regulated products tend to act as a bridge for investors who would not typically use crypto exchanges. These factors can contribute to a more stable investment base, although they do not eliminate the influence of market cycles or sentiment-driven trading. Assessing the Significance of the Inflow Although Amonyx characterized the development as bullish, the full market effect will depend on how consistent these inflows become. A single strong period does not determine a sustained trend, and future ETF activity will continue to be influenced by macroeconomic conditions, regulatory updates, and investor risk appetite. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Inflows can accelerate or slow depending on external factors such as interest rate expectations, sector-wide volatility, or shifts in institutional portfolio strategies. Monitoring ongoing ETF reports, such as Vanguard allowing its clients access to crypto ETFs , will help establish whether this latest increase represents the beginning of a longer pattern or a standalone move. The new purchase reported by Amonyx — $89.65 million added to XRP ETFs, raising total net assets to $723.05 million — marks a substantial update for those tracking institutional involvement. The influencer views the development as bullish, and the figures indicate heightened interest from investors using regulated financial products. Whether this allocation leads to sustained growth in ETF participation will become clearer as additional flow data emerges in the weeks ahead.

The regulator is urging exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers to reconsider launching complex, risky high-leverage ETFs . This caution extends squarely to the cryptocurrency sector, marking a significant moment for digital asset investors. What Did the SEC Actually Say About High-Leverage ETFs? According to reports, the SEC sent a formal letter to ETF issuers. The core message was clear: think twice before bringing new high-leverage ETFs to market. The Commission emphasized that this guidance includes funds tied to volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Moreover, the SEC stressed that issuers must ensure investors fully understand the extreme risks involved with these products. Why Are Regulators So Concerned? High-leverage ETFs are designed to amplify the daily returns of an underlying index. For example, a 2x leveraged ETF aims to double the index’s daily gain. However, this works both ways—losses are also magnified. Over time, due to daily resets and compounding, these products can deviate wildly from the long-term performance of the asset they track. Extreme Volatility: They can produce staggering losses in short periods, especially in turbulent markets. Compounding Risk: Daily re-leveraging can erode value in sideways or volatile markets, a effect many retail investors misunderstand. Investor Misunderstanding: The SEC fears buyers see the potential for amplified gains but overlook the amplified risks of ruin. What Does This Mean for Crypto ETFs? This warning casts a shadow over future cryptocurrency ETF proposals that employ leverage. The crypto market is already known for its sharp price swings. Combining that inherent volatility with leverage creates a potentially dangerous cocktail for the average investor. The SEC’s move suggests a more cautious, protective stance as crypto products seek mainstream adoption. Therefore, issuers hoping to launch a 3x leveraged Bitcoin ETF, for instance, may face much tougher scrutiny. The path forward will likely require exceptionally clear risk disclosures and perhaps even restrictions on who can buy such products. How Should Investors Navigate This New Warning? The SEC’s action is ultimately a guardrail, not a roadblock. It aims to protect market participants. For investors, this is a crucial reminder to always understand what you own. Know the Product: Before investing in any ETF, especially a high-leverage ETF , research how it works. Don’t just focus on the potential upside. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: These are speculative tools, not long-term buy-and-hold investments. They are often best suited for sophisticated, active traders. Read the Fine Print: Issuers will be compelled to heighten their warnings. Pay close attention to them. The Bottom Line: A Shift Towards Investor Protection The SEC’s warning signals a tightening regulatory environment for complex financial products. While innovation in the ETF and crypto spaces is welcome, it must not come at the cost of investor safety. This proactive step aims to prevent situations where retail investors suffer catastrophic losses from products they didn’t fully comprehend. In conclusion, the era of the “anything goes” ETF launch may be cooling. The focus is shifting squarely to transparency and suitability. For the crypto market, this is a growing pain on its path to maturity, emphasizing that with greater adoption comes greater regulatory responsibility. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is a high-leverage ETF? A: A high-leverage ETF uses financial derivatives to amplify the daily returns of an index or asset. A 2x ETF aims for twice the daily return, while a 3x ETF aims for three times. This magnifies both gains and losses. Q: Why is the SEC warning about them now? A: The SEC is likely concerned about the proliferation of these complex products and the risk they pose to retail investors who may not understand the severe downside risks, particularly in volatile markets like cryptocurrency. Q: Does this affect existing leveraged Bitcoin ETFs? A> While the letter targets new launches, it reflects the SEC’s heightened concern over the asset class. It could lead to stricter oversight of existing products and certainly sets a higher bar for future approvals. Q: Should I sell my leveraged ETFs? A> This is not specific investment advice. However, the SEC’s warning is a critical reminder to review your holdings. Ensure you understand the risks and that these products align with your investment goals and risk tolerance. Q: Will this stop all new crypto ETFs? A> No. This specifically targets high-leverage ETFs . The path for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which don’t use leverage, is a separate regulatory discussion, though the overall cautious tone may influence the pace of approvals.

55336109,639803,1764835567,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55336109.jpeg,Bitcoin Hyper Becomes the Best Crypto Presale as it Nears $30M,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hyper-best-crypto-presale-nears-30m-raise/,"Quick Facts: Bitcoin’s base layer still struggles with slow throughput, volatile fees, and limited programmability, leaving a gap between its store‑of‑value status and everyday usability. Bitcoin Hyper introduces the first Bitcoin Layer-2 with SVM integration, aiming to deliver Solana‑level performance while inheriting Bitcoin’s security guarantees. By enabling fast, low‑fee wrapped $BTC payments, DeFi protocols, and gaming/NFT dApps, Bitcoin Hyper targets real utility rather than speculative hype. $HYPER has raised over $28.95M in presale so far and targets Q1 2026 as its release window. Bitcoin is still the market’s reserve asset, but it’s terrible as a day‑to‑day network. Block times are slow, fees spike whenever demand returns, and basic programmability is still bolted on through workarounds rather than designed in. For builders and users, that’s a massive gap between Bitcoin’s brand and Bitcoin’s actual UX. At the same time, you’ve seen what happens when throughput and low fees are solved. Solana’s surge in DeFi, meme coins, and gaming shows what sub‑second confirmation and near‑zero transaction costs can unlock. The catch is simple: most of that activity isn’t secured by Bitcoin, the asset institutions actually trust. That’s the hole Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is trying to punch through. It aims to combine Bitcoin’s settlement strength with Solana‑style speed, giving you a Layer-2 where wrapped $BTC can move cheaply, settle quickly, and plug into a full DeFi and gaming stack. So far, the market seems to like that idea. The presale has already crossed $28.95M raised as whales step in, positioning Bitcoin Hyper as one of the most aggressive attempts yet to bring high‑performance smart contracts to Bitcoin’s security base. Read more about this Layer-2 project in our Bitcoin Hyper review. Bitcoin Hyper Turns Bitcoin Into a High-Speed App Chain Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) core promise is straightforward: turn dormant $BTC into an asset you can actually use. Instead of leaving coins parked on exchanges or in cold storage, you’ll be able to move wrapped $BTC onto a Bitcoin‑secured Layer-2 that delivers low fees, high throughput, and fast confirmations for real applications. By integrating the Solana Virtual Machine , Bitcoin Hyper targets performance that can rival or even exceed Solana itself, while still anchoring to Bitcoin’s settlement layer. That translates into rapid swaps, lending, staking, lower transaction costs, and visibly improved scalability, essentially turning the Bitcoin ecosystem into a more viable choice for large-scale investors. Crucially, this isn’t just about DeFi degens. Developers also get an SVM‑based environment with Rust tooling, SDKs, and APIs built for NFT platforms, gaming dApps, and payment rails. That combination of speed and programmability, backed by the Bitcoin brand, is a big reason its presale is doing so good today. $HYPER Price Outlook, Predictions, and Next Steps The Bitcoin Hyper project is already at $28.95M with a current token price of $0.013375, staking at 40%APY, and immense long-term potential. Given Bitcoin Hyper’s projected utility and presale performance, our price prediction for $HYPER puts the token at a potential $0.20 by end-2026 and $1.50 or higher by 2030. It all depends on how fast the team pushes through the roadmap milestones and how soon Bitcoin Hyper breaks into the mainstream. In terms of pure profit, think potential ROIs of 1,395% in 2026 and 11,115% or higher by 2030. Based on these numbers and the market’s reception to Bitcoin Hyper’s value proposition, we expect $HYPER to become one of the best crypto presales of 2025. If you believe Bitcoin needs to evolve from a passive store‑of‑value to a programmable, high‑speed settlement layer, Bitcoin Hyper is making a very direct bet on that thesis. As allocations shrink and the presale edges toward $30M, this may be one of the last windows to secure lower‑entry exposure. Bitcoin Hyper has a projected release window between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026, so time isn’t on your side. Read our guide on how to buy $HYPER and get in today. Buy $HYPER while the presale is still open.

This shocking scenario is now reality for South Korean crypto investors as the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has dropped a bombshell accusation against Dunamu, operator of the popular Upbit exchange. The regulatory body has determined that Dunamu verification lapses were not mere oversights but potentially intentional acts or gross negligence. This revelation sends shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community and raises critical questions about exchange accountability. What Exactly Are the Dunamu Verification Lapses? South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit has delivered a stunning verdict regarding Dunamu’s compliance failures. According to Blockmedia’s report, the FIU didn’t characterize these shortcomings as simple mistakes. Instead, they labeled the post-verification failures as either intentional disregard for regulations or acts of gross negligence. This distinction matters tremendously because it suggests the exchange knew or should have known about compliance requirements but failed to implement them properly. The term ‘post-verification’ refers to the ongoing monitoring processes exchanges must conduct after initially approving users. These processes include tracking suspicious transactions, updating customer information, and reporting unusual activities to authorities. When these systems fail, they create vulnerabilities that criminals can exploit for money laundering or other illicit activities. Why Does This Classification Matter for Crypto Investors? The FIU’s characterization transforms this from a technical compliance issue to a potential breach of trust. Here’s why every cryptocurrency user should pay attention: Investor Protection at Risk: Verification systems exist primarily to protect users from fraud and financial crimes Market Confidence Implications: When major exchanges face serious allegations, it can undermine trust in the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem Regulatory Consequences: Intentional violations typically carry heavier penalties than accidental oversights Precedent Setting: This case could establish how regulators approach exchange compliance failures globally South Korea has positioned itself as a cryptocurrency hub with progressive but strict regulations. The FIU’s strong stance demonstrates their commitment to enforcing these rules, even against major players like Dunamu, which operates one of the country’s largest exchanges. How Could Verification Failures Impact the Crypto Industry? The implications of these Dunamu verification lapses extend far beyond a single exchange. Regulatory bodies worldwide are watching how South Korea handles this situation, potentially shaping global cryptocurrency oversight approaches. Moreover, this incident highlights the tension between rapid technological innovation and necessary financial safeguards. For everyday cryptocurrency users, the practical consequences might include: Tighter verification requirements across all exchanges Increased transaction monitoring and reporting Potential delays in withdrawal and deposit processes Greater transparency demands from regulatory bodies These developments, while potentially inconvenient, ultimately strengthen the cryptocurrency ecosystem against bad actors. However, the allegation that failures might have been intentional raises troubling questions about exchange priorities. What’s Next for Dunamu and South Korea’s Crypto Regulation? The FIU’s findings represent just the beginning of this regulatory saga. Dunamu now faces significant challenges, including potential penalties, operational restrictions, and reputational damage. The exchange must demonstrate to both regulators and users that it has addressed these verification shortcomings comprehensively. Meanwhile, other cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea and beyond are likely reviewing their own compliance systems. The FIU has sent a clear message that verification requirements cannot be treated as optional or secondary concerns. This incident may accelerate industry-wide improvements in anti-money laundering protocols and customer protection measures. For cryptocurrency adoption to continue growing, exchanges must balance innovation with responsibility. The Dunamu verification lapses case serves as a crucial reminder that regulatory compliance isn’t just about avoiding penalties—it’s about maintaining the trust that enables cryptocurrency to function as legitimate financial infrastructure. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Exchange Accountability The FIU’s determination regarding Dunamu’s verification failures marks a pivotal moment in cryptocurrency regulation. By characterizing the lapses as potentially intentional or grossly negligent, regulators have raised the stakes for exchange compliance. This development underscores that cryptocurrency platforms must prioritize security and verification with the same seriousness as traditional financial institutions. As the industry matures, incidents like these, while concerning, ultimately contribute to stronger safeguards and greater legitimacy. The path forward requires exchanges to embrace their responsibilities while regulators provide clear, consistent oversight. Only through this balance can cryptocurrency achieve its potential as a transformative financial technology. Frequently Asked Questions What is Dunamu, and why is it important? Dunamu operates Upbit, one of South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Its regulatory compliance matters because it serves millions of users and influences industry standards. What does ‘post-verification’ mean in cryptocurrency exchanges? Post-verification refers to the ongoing monitoring processes exchanges conduct after initial user approval, including transaction tracking, suspicious activity reporting, and customer information updates. How could intentional verification lapses affect cryptocurrency users? Intentional failures could expose users to increased fraud risk, undermine market confidence, and potentially lead to financial losses if illicit activities exploit system vulnerabilities. What penalties might Dunamu face for these verification lapses? Potential consequences include substantial fines, operational restrictions, increased regulatory scrutiny, and mandatory implementation of enhanced compliance systems. Will this incident affect other cryptocurrency exchanges? Yes, other exchanges will likely review and strengthen their verification systems in response, potentially leading to industry-wide improvements in compliance standards. How can cryptocurrency users protect themselves amid such incidents? Users should diversify across multiple reputable exchanges, enable all available security features, monitor their accounts regularly, and stay informed about regulatory developments.

Lummis Hints At US Bitcoin Buy With ‘Franklin’ Meme,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/us-sen-lummis-us-bitcoin-buy-franklin-meme/,"US Senator Cynthia Lummis has reignited speculation that the United States could move to materially increase its Bitcoin holdings, after posting a Bitcoin-themed image on X with the caption: “₿ig things coming for Franklin!” Lummis Revives Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Hype The image is drawn as a children’s book cover titled “FRANKLIN BUYS BITCOIN AND FINDS FINANCIAL FREEDOM.” At the center sits Franklin, a cartoon turtle in a backwards red cap and bandana, seated at a wooden desk. In front of him is a laptop emblazoned with the orange Bitcoin logo, clearly signaling that he is using Bitcoin-related software or services—most obviously, buying or managing BTC. Franklin’s eyes project bright “laser beams” at the screen, echoing the well-known “laser eyes” meme in Bitcoin culture. Related Reading: Bitcoin Blasts To $92,000, Liquidating $182 Million In Shorts On the desk lie physical coins stamped with the Bitcoin symbol, and a glass jar filled with more of these Bitcoin coins. The jar seems to function as a visual metaphor for saving and stacking sats over time. The subtitle “and finds financial freedom” explicitly connects Bitcoin accumulation with the idea of long-term economic sovereignty. Bitcoin-focused accounts immediately interpreted the post as a policy signal rather than a simple meme. Bitcoin Magazine summarized the moment as: “JUST IN: US Senator Cynthia Lummis hints at buying Bitcoin”. Bitcoin Archive went further, claiming: “JUST IN: US Senator Cynthia Lummis hints at a potential US Bitcoin buy. Senator Lummis has recently submitted legislation to have the US government buy 1 million Bitcoin.” Related Reading: Bitcoin And The 2026 Fed Shift: Expert Says Markets Aren’t Ready That reading is consistent with Lummis’ own public rhetoric. On November 5 she wrote via X: “I truly believe the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is the only solution to offset our national debt. I applaud @POTUS and his administration for embracing the SBR, and I look forward to getting it done.” Her legislation has pushed for a formal US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and explicitly contemplated the government holding up to 1 million BTC over time. The meme also lands after President Trump’s executive order from March this year establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve framework. While it has become very quiet around the topic, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently attended the opening of the Bitcoin bar PubKey in Washington. For many in the market, those developments, combined with Lummis’ latest post, suggest that concrete steps toward expanding US Bitcoin reserves may be progressing quietly in the background. So far, however, there has been no official confirmation of state-level Bitcoin purchases. For now, Franklin remains a symbolic turtle with laser eyes at a Bitcoin laptop—but in a market hyper-attuned to political signals, Lummis’ image is being read as the clearest hint yet that the United States could one day be the largest sovereign Bitcoin buyer. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $93,381.

This announcement is more than just a routine update; it’s a significant endorsement for a cryptocurrency built from the ground up for gamers and creators. For investors and enthusiasts alike, this development opens a new chapter, potentially bridging the worlds of decentralized finance and interactive entertainment. What Does It Mean When Coinbase Adds BEAM to Its Roadmap? First, let’s clarify what a “listing roadmap” entails. This is not an immediate listing guarantee. Instead, it’s a public declaration of intent. Coinbase uses this process to signal which assets it is actively evaluating for potential future trading support. Therefore, when Coinbase adds BEAM, it places the project under a powerful spotlight, subjecting it to rigorous technical and compliance reviews. This step significantly boosts BEAM’s credibility and visibility in the broader cryptocurrency market. Why is BEAM a Standout Candidate? BEAM isn’t just another meme coin.

This high-profile talent acquisition represents more than just another executive shuffle—it’s a calculated power play in the intensifying artificial intelligence arms race, with significant implications for the future of consumer technology and the competitive landscape between tech titans. Why Meta Poaches Apple’s Design Leadership The recruitment of Alan Dye from Apple represents a deliberate strategy by Meta to strengthen its design capabilities at the highest level. Dye, who led Apple’s human interface team since 2015, brings a decade of experience shaping some of the world’s most recognizable and successful user interfaces. His departure from Apple and arrival at Meta signals a significant shift in the balance of design talent between these competing technology giants. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Dye will report directly to Meta’s Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth and focus specifically on improving AI features in consumer devices. This strategic placement indicates Meta’s recognition that superior artificial intelligence requires exceptional interface design—a lesson Apple mastered under Dye’s leadership. Alan Dye’s Legacy at Apple and New Role at Meta Alan Dye’s impact on Apple’s design language cannot be overstated. During his tenure, he oversaw the visual evolution of iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS, maintaining Apple’s signature aesthetic while adapting to changing user needs and technological capabilities. His team was responsible for the cohesive design language that has become synonymous with Apple products worldwide. At Meta, Dye faces a different challenge: creating intuitive interfaces for emerging technologies where established design patterns don’t yet exist. His primary focus will be on: Smart glasses interfaces that blend digital information with physical reality Virtual reality headset controls that feel natural and immersive AI interactions that anticipate user needs without being intrusive Cross-device experiences that maintain consistency across Meta’s ecosystem Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed that Steve Lemay, a veteran designer with key roles in every major Apple interface since 1999, will replace Dye. This succession plan suggests Apple anticipated this possibility and prepared accordingly. The AI Design Revolution in Smart Glasses and Virtual Reality Meta’s aggressive push into consumer hardware—particularly smart glasses and virtual reality headsets—creates unique design challenges that traditional interface paradigms cannot solve. These devices require: Device Type Design Challenge Dye’s Potential Contribution Smart Glasses Minimal, contextual interfaces that don’t obstruct vision Spatial computing expertise from Apple’s AR initiatives VR Headsets Immersive controls that feel natural in 3D space Human-centered design philosophy from Apple’s ecosystem AI Assistants Conversational interfaces that understand context Experience with Siri integration across Apple devices The integration of artificial intelligence into these devices presents particularly complex design problems. How should an AI assistant manifest in augmented reality? What visual cues indicate when smart glasses are processing information? How do users control virtual reality experiences with minimal physical input? These are precisely the questions Dye is positioned to answer. The Intensifying Tech Talent War in Artificial Intelligence Meta’s recruitment of Alan Dye represents just the latest salvo in an escalating talent war between technology companies competing for artificial intelligence expertise. This summer, Meta also poached researchers from OpenAI, and reports suggest CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally participated in recruitment efforts—including allegedly hand-delivering homemade soup to an OpenAI employee. This aggressive talent acquisition strategy reveals several key insights about the current state of the AI industry: Design has become a critical differentiator in AI implementation, not just technical capability Consumer hardware represents the next major battleground for AI dominance Cross-pollination between companies is accelerating as expertise becomes more specialized Personal recruitment efforts by executives indicate the strategic importance of key hires OpenAI’s response—with chief research officer Mark Chen reportedly delivering his own soup to promising Meta recruits—highlights the reciprocal nature of this talent competition. Strategic Implications for Meta’s Hardware Ambitions Meta’s acquisition of Alan Dye signals a maturation of the company’s hardware strategy. While Meta has invested heavily in virtual reality through Oculus and augmented reality through various research initiatives, the company has faced criticism for clunky interfaces and unintuitive user experiences. Dye’s hiring suggests Meta recognizes that superior technology requires superior design to achieve mainstream adoption. This move aligns with Meta’s broader pivot toward artificial intelligence as a core competency. As the company shifts focus from social networking to immersive computing, having design leadership with experience creating beloved consumer interfaces becomes increasingly valuable. Dye’s track record at Apple—where design decisions directly influenced product success—provides Meta with proven expertise in an area where it has historically struggled. What This Means for Apple’s Design Future While losing a key design executive represents a setback for Apple, the company’s deep bench of design talent and established processes should mitigate the impact. Steve Lemay’s promotion to lead the human interface team ensures continuity, given his extensive experience with Apple’s design language and philosophy. However, Dye’s departure does create an opportunity for Meta to potentially close the design gap that has traditionally separated the two companies. Apple’s design leadership has been a significant competitive advantage for decades, and any erosion of that advantage could reshape the competitive dynamics in consumer technology. FAQs: Understanding the Meta-Apple Design Executive Move Who is Alan Dye? Alan Dye is the design executive who led Apple’s human interface team for the past decade, overseeing the visual design of iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. He played a key role in maintaining and evolving Apple’s signature aesthetic across all product lines. What will Alan Dye do at Meta? At Meta, Dye will focus on improving AI features in consumer devices like smart glasses and virtual reality headsets. He will report directly to Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth and work on creating intuitive interfaces for emerging technologies. Who is replacing Alan Dye at Apple? Steve Lemay, who has had a key role in the design of every major Apple interface since 1999, will replace Dye as head of Apple’s human interface team, according to Apple CEO Tim Cook. Why is this hire significant for Meta? This hire represents Meta’s recognition that superior artificial intelligence requires exceptional interface design. Dye brings proven expertise in creating beloved consumer interfaces—an area where Meta has faced criticism despite significant technological investments. Is this part of a larger trend in tech talent acquisition? Yes, this follows Meta’s recruitment of researchers from OpenAI earlier this year and reflects an escalating talent war between technology companies competing for artificial intelligence expertise. Both companies have engaged in personal recruitment efforts, including reported instances of executives delivering homemade soup to potential hires. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment in Tech Competition Meta’s successful poaching of Apple’s design executive Alan Dye represents a watershed moment in the competition between technology giants. This move transcends typical executive recruitment—it signifies Meta’s understanding that the next phase of artificial intelligence development requires design excellence equal to technical innovation. As smart glasses, virtual reality headsets, and other immersive technologies approach mainstream adoption, the interfaces that mediate human-AI interaction will become increasingly critical to commercial success. The implications extend beyond these two companies, potentially reshaping how all technology firms approach talent acquisition in the AI era. When executives personally deliver soup to recruit key personnel, and when design leadership becomes as strategically valuable as engineering talent, we’re witnessing the emergence of a new competitive paradigm. Meta’s coup may well be remembered as the moment when design officially became recognized as a decisive factor in the artificial intelligence arms race.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.98 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $5.02. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.503 Market cap $537.71M Trading volume (24-hour) $21.88M Circulating supply 1.067B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3505 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.5057 24-hour low $0.4915 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 10.25% (Very High) 50-day SMA $0.5608 14-Day RSI 43.69 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 28 (Fear) Green days 13/30 (43%) 200-day SMA $0.7062 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: XTZ is testing the key resistance level of $0.51. The coin’s daily momentum is improving, but it is not yet confirmed as bullish. Holding $0.496 support in the short term supports continuation toward $0.515 to $0.520. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart As of December 4, XTZ is pressing into the Bollinger mid-band around $0.509 to $0.510, which is acting as the first real resistance after the bounce off $0.46. The structure remains corrective rather than fully bullish, but the improvement in candle bodies signals that buyers are gradually stepping back in. The MACD has printed its first few positive bars after a long negative cycle, showing an early momentum shift, although the signal lines remain below zero. RSI sits at 44, still in recovery territory and not signaling exhaustion. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView If the daily candle fails to close above $0.51, price risks sliding back into the $0.48 zone. A clean reclaim of the mid-band would open the path toward $0.53 to $0.56, which aligns with the upper band. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, XTZ continues to trend upward, with the Alligator lines cleanly stacked and the Lips supporting price around $0.496. The sequence of higher lows confirms buyers remain in control intraday. The MACD histogram is positive but flattening, indicating momentum is present yet no longer accelerating. OBV is climbing steadily, confirming that accumulation is supporting the move. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView XTZ’s resistance appears near $0.508 to $0.510, matching the daily mid-band. A breakout above this zone would allow continuation toward $0.515 to $0.520. Failure to hold above $0.496 could trigger a deeper pullback to $0.492 or even $0.486, where trend support sits. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.6109 SELL SMA 5 $0.6061 SELL SMA 10 $0.6194 SELL SMA 21 $0.6019 SELL SMA 50 $0.6118 SELL SMA 100 $0.6866 SELL SMA 200 $0.7089 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.5936 SELL EMA 5 $0.6147 SELL EMA 10 $0.6582 SELL EMA 21 $0.7133 SELL EMA 50 $0.7429 SELL EMA 100 $0.7261 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.7379 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? XTZ is likely to consolidate between $0.50 and $0.51 before attempting a breakout. A close above $0.51 strengthens the path toward $0.53. A drop below $0.496 would slow the recovery. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $1.5 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future?

The SUI price action has been extremely bearish, while Ethereum has been almost entirely engulfed by short to medium-term bearish sentiment. For anyone looking for shelter during this volatility, the Digitap ($TAP) crypto bank presale may be the best option, as this crypto’s utility within the omnibanking ecosystem arguably makes it resistant to short-term sentiment shifts. The argument for $TAP being the best crypto presale to buy now comes from the token’s direct connection to the Digitap omnibanking ecosystem, which maintains its value even as the altcoin market is experiencing brutal selling pressure. As the market turns red, it is easy to panic, to sell at a loss, or to avoid crypto altogether. However, many of the best trades are made during times of extreme fear, and $TAP might be the best alternative for those looking for the best crypto to buy beyond the established altcoins such as ETH and SUI. $TAP: A Crypto Presale Resistant to Short-Term Market Swings Digitap is the world’s first true omnibank, providing a direct connection between the traditional finance world and the crypto markets. Its core objective is to provide the gold standard of on and off ramps between crypto and fiat for individual users and businesses. By enabling seamless switching between both systems, Digitap aims to carve out a significant share of the payments market and deliver sustained value to long-term holders of the $TAP token. The $TAP presale is structured in time-based tiers, meaning that the price increases automatically at predetermined stages. The current price is 0.0326 USDT, and the presale has already raised over $2 million with more than 130 million $TAP sold. This shows consistent demand from investors who view $TAP as a discounted entry into the Digitap ecosystem ahead of its global rollout. $TAP unlocks key utilities across the platform. Holders will be able to earn staking rewards, benefit from transaction-generated token burns, access governance voting, receive cashback on spending, and use $TAP for discounted fees on card payments and currency swaps. Every transaction processed through the platform adds revenue to the ecosystem, which increases support for $TAP due to the burn mechanisms tied directly to real user activity. Price predictions for $TAP have been extremely bullish. Analysts estimate that the token could reach $1 to $5 after launch due to the combination of global payments adoption, deflationary tokenomics, and utility demand. Many presale buyers have framed $TAP as a hedge against current market downturns because the token’s value is supported by revenue-producing utility rather than speculative hype. This is why the ongoing bearish trend across the altcoin market has not slowed adoption of the presale. SUI Price Crash: Layer-1 Coin Tumbles Below $1.5 The SUI price crash has been brutal. The layer-1 network’s native currency performed exceptionally well earlier in the year but has since been trapped in a downward trend. The broader market crash this week added considerable selling pressure, pushing its price below $1.5 and down toward $1.3. The chart shows a clear breakdown of several support levels, with high volume selling accelerating the move. There is very limited structural support until around the $1 zone, which raises the risk of further declines if bearish momentum continues. Analysts are now divided. Some expect a recovery above $2 if the broader market rebounds, while others believe continued selling and weak sentiment could drag SUI even lower over the coming weeks. Ethereum Price Action Turns Bearish Below $2,800 The Ethereum price has not fared much better than SUI. The leading smart contract platform and the second largest crypto by market capitalization behind Bitcoin has been hit hard by the bear market. The truth is that the ETH price has struggled throughout most of the year compared to Bitcoin, and now it is stumbling, so holders have been hurt twice — first from underperformance during the good times and now from a rapid decline during the bad times. Final Thoughts on The Best Crypto To Buy As ETH and SUI Crash The $TAP presale has quickly become the best crypto presale to buy now as the SUI price tumbled below $1.5 and ETH continues to shed billions of its market capitalization. The $TAP token is expected to play a central role in the Digitap ecosystem, unlocking utility and rewarding holders who contribute to the daily operation of the omnibanking platform. For many traders, this combination of utility and early-stage pricing makes $TAP the standout choice during the current market downturn.

In a significant move, founder Vitalik Buterin has outlined three structural changes designed to fortify the network’s defenses. These updates aim to proactively minimize Ethereum attack vectors, making the entire ecosystem more robust and predictable for developers and users alike. Let’s break down what this means for the future of the world’s leading smart contract platform. Why is Minimizing Ethereum Attack Vectors So Important? Think of a blockchain like a digital fortress. The larger and more complex it becomes, the more potential doors and windows exist for bad actors to exploit. Ethereum’s incredible flexibility, which allows for complex decentralized applications (dApps), also increases its potential “attack surface.” Buterin’s new proposals are about strategically reinforcing the walls and limiting how much force any single transaction can exert on the system. This shift is crucial for long-term stability as Ethereum scales to serve billions. Update 1: Limiting Contract Code Access Per Transaction The first change involves placing a sensible limit on how much contract code a single transaction can interact with. Currently, a malicious transaction could theoretically try to call upon vast amounts of code, creating unpredictable loads. By capping this, Ethereum introduces a fundamental constraint. Benefit: It prevents resource exhaustion attacks that could slow down or destabilize the network. Result: More predictable gas costs and execution times for everyone. This is a foundational step to minimize Ethereum attack vectors related to computational spam and denial-of-service scenarios. Update 2: Capping ZK-EVM Prover Cycles With the rise of zero-knowledge (ZK) scaling solutions, a new type of computational load enters the picture: proof generation. Buterin proposes a hard cap on the number of prover cycles—the computational work needed to generate a ZK proof—that can be demanded per block. Benefit: It ensures Layer 2 rollups using ZK technology cannot overwhelm the main Ethereum chain with excessively complex proofs. Result: A smoother integration of scaling tech, preserving network security as it grows. This forward-thinking rule safeguards the base layer as advanced cryptography becomes more common, directly addressing future Ethereum attack vectors. Update 3: Overhauling EVM Memory & Strengthening Hard Caps The third update tackles the Ethereum Virtual Machine’s (EVM) memory model. Buterin suggests revising the cost structure for memory usage and, more importantly, strengthening the existing hard caps on how much memory a transaction can consume. Benefit: It makes memory-based attacks economically unfeasible and technically bounded. Result: A more efficient and secure execution environment for all smart contracts. This change closes loopholes that could be used to craft transactions designed to greedily consume resources and crash nodes. How Will These Changes Impact Developers and Users? You might wonder if these constraints will hinder innovation. The answer is a strategic “no.” Buterin frames this as “making Ethereum a simpler and more secure system.” For developers, it means working within clearer, safer boundaries. For users, it translates to greater network reliability and security for their assets and applications. The goal isn’t to limit creativity but to provide a stable foundation for it to flourish, free from the shadow of major exploits. By systematically working to minimize Ethereum attack vectors, the network becomes a more trustworthy platform for the next generation of the web. A Compelling Summary: A More Predictable and Secure Ethereum Vitalik Buterin’s three proposed updates represent a mature evolution in Ethereum’s design philosophy. The network is moving from a “maximally flexible” approach to a “maximally secure and predictable” one. This proactive stance to minimize Ethereum attack vectors is not about fixing past mistakes, but about engineering a resilient future. By placing intelligent limits on transaction load, proof complexity, and memory use, Ethereum is building the digital equivalent of shock absorbers and circuit breakers. This foresight ensures the network can handle exponential growth while remaining the secure, decentralized backbone of Web3. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Will these updates make Ethereum transactions more expensive? A: Not necessarily. While they introduce new limits, they also aim to create more predictable pricing. The changes are designed to prevent extreme, unpredictable gas spikes caused by malicious transactions, which could lead to a more stable cost environment overall. Q2: Do these changes mean my existing smart contract will break? A: Most existing, well-designed contracts should operate normally. The updates are focused on establishing upper limits for extreme edge cases. Developers should review the final specifications, but widespread breakage is not the intention. Q3: When will these updates be implemented? A: These are proposals from Vitalik Buterin and will need to be discussed, refined, and formally accepted by the Ethereum developer community. They will likely be included in a future network upgrade (hard fork), so implementation is months away at a minimum. Q4: How do these changes relate to Ethereum’s scalability? A: They are complementary. Scalability solutions like rollups handle transaction volume, while these updates ensure the base layer security that those rollups rely on remains rock-solid. They make Ethereum a more secure anchor for scaling. Q5: What is the main benefit for the average crypto user? A: Increased security and reliability. A network with minimized attack vectors is less likely to suffer from disruptive exploits or downtime, which protects the value and functionality of the assets and applications you use. Q6: Are other blockchains implementing similar measures? A: Many newer blockchains are designed with similar resource limits from the start. Ethereum is applying these lessons proactively to its mature, established network, which is a complex but necessary task to ensure its long-term health.

This token is nearing the mark of 99% allocation and many analysts believe that it wants to hit the threshold faster than expected. Numerous investors who have been tracking the best crypto opportunities are interested in the next move that might make or break this project to be one of the first 20x entries into the upcoming cycle. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) One of the most active tokens of the year is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This project has been initiated at a price of $0.01 in early 2025 and has soared to $0.035, a 250% increase. Capitalization has already raised up to $19.1 million and the count of holders is more than 18,300. The total purchased tokens are more than 810 million. Mutuum Finance is an initiative that is working on a decentralized lending protocol based on the actual borrowing demand. Users borrow the assets, including ETH or USDT, and earn mtTokens, which increase in value until borrowers make interest payments. The liquidity management in the system utilizes two lending markets to facilitate borrowing and keep the rates stable incorporating inbuilt LTV regulations and liquidations where necessary. This framework has assisted Mutuum Finance to cross the radar of traders who seek new crypto entries that have developing utility. V1 and Buy-and-Distribute Model Mutuum Finance stated on its official X account that V1 testnet will go live in Q4 2025 on the Sepolia network. The initial one will consist of the liquidity pool, the mtTokens, the debt tracker, and the liquidator bot with the initial assets being ETH and USDT. There is the strength of the project, the mtToken system. Each time a person provides liquidity, he/she is provided with mtTokens which gain value as other people remit interests to the pool. This provides the true APY of lenders as a result of the activity within the protocol. The buy-and-distribute system is also noted by analysts as one of the significant long-term motifs. Some of the protocol revenue is purchased on the open market using a share of the protocol revenue. The acquired tokens are given to users that stake the mtTokens in the safety module. This produces inherent purchasing tension which increases as utilization of protocols increases. Having all these features, some analysts model 5x to 8x increase soon after V1 is launched. Noticeable projection to the long-term, a 20x growth is possible under adoption and revenue growth. Roadmap Plans Mutuum Finance is gearing up to create a USD-pegged stablecoin which will be printed and burned in response to demand. Its support will be in borrower interest. Analysts also declare this stablecoin to be one of the significant components of the roadmap since it can broaden the liquidity and trigger more borrowing in the event that the protocol becomes live. The team will also intend to spread to various layer-2 networks. Mutuum Finance can access additional users and consequently cut charges as well as expand borrowing markets faster when it makes use of L2 scaling. Multiple chain deployment represented one of the driving forces behind successful DeFi protocols in previous cycles. Accurate pricing will be based on Chainlink feeds, fallback oracles, aggregate pricing, and DEX data to be used at Mutuum Finance. This will ensure that liquidations are made properly and that the users are safeguarded when there are turbulent times in the market. Security Oversight and Daily Incentives Mutuum Finance still puts security as a core concern. The project is a Pass of CertiK audit, with a 90/100 Token Scan score, indicating a solid foundation of a new DeFi protocol. Halborn security is looking into the fundamental lending agreements and the team issued a bug bounty of $50k to discover any code vulnerabilities before the testnet launches. The 24-hour leaderboard provides a daily activity boost and awarding the most prolific the best contributor with $500 in MUTM. This system ensures that the involvement of the community is maintained and that there is daily funding motivation. Urgency is increasing rapidly with the present allocation being at 99%. According to analysts, the last percent usually trades much faster than other stages, with buyers rushing in to take the last tokens at the $0.035 mark, before the next price increase. Mutuum Finance is now one of the most viewed DeFi crypto-entrants of the year. The project has a solid early foundation with mtToken yield, dual lending market, buy-and-distribute, stablecoin scale, L2 implementation, verified contracts and a verifiable V1 rollout. As Phase 6 is nearly exhausted and the number of tokens is negligible, analysts reckon that this might be one of the final chances before the next price rise. Provided the current demand remains the same, Mutuum Finance might get a lot of returns in the next cycle.

The court found that the trial court erred in concluding it lacked personal jurisdiction over Binance. According to a report by Bloomberg, the Florida Court of Appeal has allowed a state-level lawsuit to proceed against Binance. Plaintiff demands that Binance pay up The plaintiff argues that the exchange was negligent, breached its contract, and aided in laundering stolen property by not freezing user funds as soon as the theft was reported. He wants to recover the entire amount he lost, plus interest. Two years ago, Michael Osterer filed a class-action case on behalf of others whose assets had been stolen and allegedly laundered through Binance. A related federal money laundering case was recently moved to Florida’s Southern District, but the current ruling focuses on Osterer’s own claims under state law. The new case gives the plaintiff the opportunity to argue that, despite Binance Holdings Inc. being based outside of Florida, it has sufficient ties to the state for the claim to be heard in Florida courts. The lower court had dismissed the case because it lacked personal jurisdiction. However, the appeal court argued that California law could plausibly apply and that Binance cannot be automatically excluded from jurisdiction simply because it is an offshore exchange. Cases on Binance’s involvement in money laundering pile up The case puts the company at risk of a revival of more lawsuits on top of several other lawsuits this year, claiming the company failed to secure or freeze stolen assets. This case was revived after a new case that accused the company of helping send millions of dollars to US-designated terrorist organizations, including Hamas and Hezbollah. The legal action against the world’s largest crypto platform was brought by US victims of the attacks in Israel or their families two years ago. As reported by Cryptopolitan, the lawsuit points to the transfer of more than $1 billion to and from accounts connected to organizations designated by the US as foreign terrorist groups and responsible for the 7 October attacks. Those payments included $50m sent after the 7 October attacks and at least two transactions sent from the US. Just posted: the pardon that Trump issued to @cz_binance on Tuesday. It wipes away CZ's conviction for failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program, which prosecutors said allowed Hamas, Al Qaeda & ISIS to move money using @binance . https://t.co/ptbRCzxhd3 pic.twitter.com/1B9tKnZG6P — Kenneth P. Vogel (@kenvogel) October 25, 2025 Binance had pleaded guilty and agreed to pay more than $4 billion in penalties to resolve charges of money laundering and sanctions violations brought by the US government two years ago. At the time, it pledged to improve its anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance programes as part of that agreement. However, even after the settlement, lawsuits claim that the company maintained a policy to only screen funds for suspicious activity when customers tried to transfer money off the platform. A recent report by ICIJ revealed that when the company was under the supervision of court-appointed monitors, at least $408 million worth of crypto flowed to Binance accounts from Huione Group, a Cambodia-based financial firm used by Chinese crime gangs to launder proceeds from human trafficking and industrial-scale scam operations. To that end, Binance is expected to appeal the decision or push for arbitration. The case now returns to the trial court, where the merits, negligence, contract breach, and recovery of stolen funds will once again be argued. Additionally, the suit could set a precedent for victims of crypto thefts to challenge exchanges’ asset recovery protocols, amid rising scrutiny on platform security. Don’t just read crypto news.

Onchain activity weakened across all major categories, with blockchain revenues, DEX volumes, and perp funding rates falling sharply while stablecoin supply pulled back from October’s peak. Market structure signals caution but not collapse, as leverage reset to April lows, ETP outflows remained manageable, and institutional participation, combined with lower volatility, points to a smaller drawdown than prior cycles. Price and onchain metrics weakened, but institutional participation and lower volatility point to a milder drawdown than last cycle’s -78% decline.

Crypto investors felt like they were tossed through a washing machine in November, as relentless selling pressure shook coins loose from weaker hands. The result was that Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) reached the lowest 30-day Relative Strength Index ((RSI)) readings (~32) since the de-peg of Lido ETH in June 2022. RSI measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes to identify overbought or oversold conditions. BTC, ETH, and SOL ( SOL-USD ) each fell (-23%), (-27%), and (-31%). Crypto selloffs were heavily concentrated during US trading sessions, which contributed roughly 85% of November BTC losses. Though the Coinbase Premium Index, which tracks Coinbase’s BTC price premium to non-US exchanges, briefly turned positive over Thanksgiving weekend, the index was negative for the vast majority of November. The “flush” in November 2025 somewhat mirrors the one crypto experienced after Trump’s tariffs in April 2025, when BTC fell from $109K to $76K. The result of recent price action is that (~55%) of Bitcoin’s supply is in profit, which marks the lowest reading since September 2023. In the previous bear market, Bitcoin supply in profit reached a low of (~31%) in November 2022 after the collapse of FTX.

Open interest in crypto futures continued to decline from October, reaching the lowest levels, $29B, since the chaos of the tariff market reaction in April 2025. BTC ETP outflows in BTC terms were (-2.5%), while ETH ETP redemptions corresponded to (-8%) of AUM measured in ETH. The extreme levels of uncertainty drove 30-day trailing volatility to the mid-40s, approaching the lower levels seen in April 2025, when volatility averaged above 50. Besides broader concerns about AI spending and Federal Reserve policy, crypto traders worried about emerging narratives around quantum computing affecting Bitcoin encryption, Digital Asset Treasury ((DAT)) weakness, and selling by ancient whales.

This dismal backdrop translated into weak onchain fundamentals, with blockchain revenues down (-37%) m/m to reach ~$200M in November. DEX volumes across all chains were down (-26%) m/m and (-35%) y/y. Meanwhile, Hyperliquid gained more market share of blockchain earnings, reaching (40%) of the market to gross $80M on the month. After the conclusion of the perpetual future DEX mania of October, BNB’s revenues have fallen (-76%) m/m, dropping it to fifth place in blockchain revenues. Stablecoin ( SBC-USD ) transfer volumes were down (-19%) m/m across all chains, but still showed y/y growth of (+54%). In that category, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) continues to dominate, posting roughly the same volumes as the next four competitors combined.

Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Stablecoins on blockchain also pulled back after reaching an all-time high of 308B in October, declining to 304B at the end of November. Though USDC lost (-2%) or 1.2B of its market capitalization, Ethena’s USDE lost (-30%) m/m or nearly (-50%) off its mid-October high (14B-$7B). The decline in overall stablecoins partly relates to the compressing rates environment for crypto. The best gauge of blockchain yields, the trailing 30-day perp funding rates, fell as low as (3.8%) after averaging (7-8%) over the summer. These yields reflect crypto traders’ willingness to take directional risk, and current levels are the lowest since October 2023. With respect to Ethena, the substantial decline is most likely attributable to the peg break it experienced due to market chaos on October 10, when some exchanges priced USDE as low as $0.65 rather than $1.00. Another bit of bad news for stablecoins came at the end of the month when S&P downgraded Tether’s rating for peg stability from 4 (constrained) to 5 (weak), which is S&P’s lowest rating.

Top Crypto Questions from Clients This Month 1 - Are bitcoin whales selling? Bitcoin Spent Volume from 5+ Year Holders (30-Day Moving Average) Source: Glassnode as of 11/26/2025. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. We have seen a modest uptick in selling of older cohorts of BTC holdings. As we can see in the chart above, this selling by older cohorts is far below earlier peaks. The largest reductions in positions have occurred in the 2-5-year holding band. This cohort has dropped in total BTC holdings by (-31%) since November 2023. These holders appear to be positioning based on their interpretation of Bitcoin’s place in the 4-year cycle. Zooming out, while the percentage of supply >5 years old has remained consistent at (30.5%), we have seen a massive drop in % the supply >2 years old category, moving from (57%) in January 2024 to (48%) today. All the while, short-term active supply, 2 - Is it too late to buy bitcoin? In our opinion, it is difficult to call any level ‘too late’ for BTC, and these levels may reflect short-term panic more than a long-term view of fundamental potential. BTC recently experienced a greater than (-30%) drawdown, which mirrors past pullbacks during bull markets in 2017 and 2021. 3 - Is crypto in a bubble? Some crypto tokens certainly need to be repriced, including those associated with ghost blockchains and low-utility applications. However, we believe there are still worthwhile investment opportunities for those with a very high risk tolerance. 4 - Have we passed the price peak in Bitcoin's 4-year cycle? Many 4-year cycle forecasters divine that we have already reached the price apex of this cycle. However, lower volatility and the explosion in real-money involvement suggest a smaller drawdown than previous cycles. Thus, VanEck bought the dip in model portfolios at ~$80K on Friday, November 21st, seeing an attractive risk/reward, with technical indicators signaling a near-term bottom. However, we remain flexible and not dogmatic about the cycle with a healthy respect for the 4-year patterns. The underlying dynamics of the 4-year cycle may have changed as Bitcoin miners diversified their income streams and institutional players viewed BTC as a unique macro asset. That noted, many in the crypto community, including large whales, believe that the Bitcoin 4-year cycle is infallible. If these parties act, they will likely weigh on prices.

This quick comeback is being linked to a vital shift in data, suggesting major U.S. investors are starting to buy again. A Key Metric Flips Positive According to XWIN Research Japan, the Coinbase Premium Index climbed back into positive territory after falling deeply negative through November. During that period, Bitcoin slipped below $90,000, reflecting softer U.S. spot buying while offshore demand held up. Historically, a negative premium has matched up with risk-off positioning among regulated U.S. investors. That backdrop changed quickly this week, with the research firm linking the rebound to a series of major announcements, including Charles Schwab, which oversees about $12 trillion, confirming plans to open Bitcoin and Ethereum trading in early 2026. It follows Vanguard’s recent reversal on crypto access, a moment that surprised many given its long-standing reluctance toward digital assets. XWIN also noted that Japan is preparing to approve Bitcoin ETFs, and with Japanese investment trusts and pension-linked retail flows behind the move, analysts at the firm estimate $3–10 billion could enter the market during the early phase of adoption. While no single market guarantees a predictable price effect, such flows can add meaningful upward pressure when combined with U.S. and European ETF demand. On top of these structural developments, Coinbase Institutional suggested in a recent outlook report that December could bring relief after Bitcoin’s unusually poor November. The team cited the end of the Federal Reserve’s quantitative tightening phase as a supportive shift, pointing out that Bitcoin had dropped more than three standard deviations below its 90-day average while the S&P 500 declined only one. Market Structure Strengthens Beyond the influx of traditional money, the current price increase is notable for its stability. Data from Binance shows that as Bitcoin rose to the $93,000 mark, the Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR) dropped to its lowest point in about a month. According to market watchers, a fast price rise is usually accompanied by increased borrowing from traders seeking bigger gains. The current decline in leverage suggests a reduction in risky speculative positions, making the market less prone to the violent, cascading sell-offs caused by mass liquidations, and building a more solid foundation for the price. This pattern of strong spot buying with low leverage mirrors characteristics seen at previous market bottoms. Analyst COINDREAM pointed out that rapid shifts in the Coinbase Premium Gap from negative to positive have historically coincided with periods of price stabilization and accumulation. The current activity suggests a similar dynamic may be unfolding, where large buyers are stepping in at perceived lower price levels.

This alarming scenario is driving South Korea to take decisive action. The country plans to impose a strict liability rule on digital asset service providers for crypto firms data breaches , fundamentally shifting how security failures are handled. This move could set a powerful precedent for global crypto regulation. What Does South Korea’s New Rule Mean for Crypto Firms Data Breaches? South Korean authorities, responding to high-profile incidents like the Coupang data leak, are embedding a strict liability provision into the forthcoming Digital Asset Basic Act. This rule means that in the event of a security incident, a company is automatically held liable for damages. The critical shift? The burden of proof moves from the user to the service provider. A company must prove it was not intentional or negligent to avoid penalties. This approach mirrors stringent financial and data protection laws in other sectors. For the crypto industry, it represents a significant escalation in accountability. The potential fines are substantial, reaching up to 3% of a firm’s revenue. Therefore, this creates a powerful financial incentive for companies to fortify their cybersecurity measures long before any incident occurs. Why Is This a Game-Changer for User Protection? The traditional model often leaves users struggling to prove a company’s negligence after a breach. South Korea’s new framework flips this script. It prioritizes consumer protection by assuming company fault first. This has several key benefits: Stronger Deterrence: The threat of major revenue-based fines makes robust security a top business priority, not an afterthought. Faster Redress for Victims: Users won’t face lengthy legal battles to establish fault, potentially speeding up compensation. Elevated Industry Standards: It encourages all crypto firms to adopt best-in-class security to avoid liability, raising the bar for the entire market. However, this shift also presents challenges. Some argue that strict liability could stifle innovation by placing a heavy compliance burden on smaller startups. Companies must now invest heavily in security infrastructure, audits, and insurance, which could increase operational costs. How Should Crypto Firms Prepare for This New Era? For digital asset service providers operating in or targeting South Korea, proactive adaptation is non-negotiable. The time to act is now, before the law is finalized and enforced. Here are actionable steps firms should consider: Conduct a Security Audit: Perform a comprehensive review of all data storage, encryption, and access protocols. Identify and patch vulnerabilities immediately. Implement Zero-Trust Architecture: Move beyond basic security. Assume breach attempts are constant and verify every access request. Enhance Transparency: Develop clear, user-friendly communication plans for potential incidents. Building trust is crucial. Explore Cybersecurity Insurance: Seek policies that can help mitigate the financial risk posed by the new penalty structure. This regulatory move signals that governments are no longer willing to treat the crypto industry with a light touch, especially concerning user data. It underscores that with financial innovation comes profound responsibility. The message to crypto firms is clear: safeguard user data with utmost seriousness or face severe consequences. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Crypto Regulation South Korea’s plan to impose strict liability for crypto firms data breaches is a watershed moment. It moves the regulatory focus from mere compliance to active, verifiable stewardship of user data. This policy will likely inspire similar measures in other jurisdictions, pushing the global crypto industry toward greater maturity and security. For users, it promises stronger protection. For companies, it demands immediate and unwavering commitment to cybersecurity excellence. The era of ambiguous accountability for data breaches in crypto is ending. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is ‘strict liability’ in the context of these crypto rules? A1: Strict liability means a crypto firm is automatically held responsible for any personal data breach it suffers. The company must prove it was not at fault to avoid penalties, reversing the usual burden of proof. Q2: How much can a firm be fined under this new South Korean rule? A2: Fines can reach up to 3% of the firm’s total revenue. This revenue-based penalty is designed to be significant enough to compel serious investment in data security. Q3: What triggered this new regulation? A3: The rule is a direct response to major data leaks in South Korea, including a significant incident at e-commerce giant Coupang. It aims to prevent similar breaches in the sensitive cryptocurrency sector. Q4: Does this rule only apply to exchanges? A4: No. It applies to ‘digital asset service providers,’ which is a broad category expected to include exchanges, wallet providers, and other crypto-related platforms handling user data. Q5: When will this law come into effect? A5: The provision will be part of the forthcoming Digital Asset Basic Act. The exact timeline for enactment is not yet finalized, but firms should begin preparing immediately. Q6: Could this model be adopted by other countries? A6: Absolutely. South Korea is often a regulatory trendsetter in crypto and tech. Other nations observing systemic risks from data breaches may implement similar strict liability frameworks.

BlackRock doubling down on its AI interest supports a utility narrative, as compared to pure speculative moves. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) introduces a mine‑to‑earn memecoin model with virtual nodes, letting users ‘mine’ without hardware while earning meme‑asset rewards on Ethereum. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) targets the $85B creator economy with AI assistants, voice cloning, and token‑gated content built around Web3 payments. BlackRock isn’t just talking about ‘mega forces’ anymore – it’s positioning around them. In its recent 2026 Global Outlook, the world’s largest asset manager has highlighted AI, digital infrastructure, and the rapid growth of stablecoins as structural trends reshaping capital markets through 2030 and beyond. The company states that it still prefers AI for 2026 because: We see the AI theme supported by strong earnings, resilient profit margins and healthy balance sheets at large listed tech companies. Continued Fed easing into 2026 and reduced policy uncertainty underpin our overweight to U.S. equities. — BlackRock, 2026 Global Outlook So, utility. That’s a very different conversation from the last cycle’s purely speculative narrative. Retail traders might still chase memes, but institutions are quietly mapping out rails and cash‑flow models. The most interesting projects now sit where those worlds intersect: consumer‑friendly apps with meme energy, AI‑native platforms that fix creator economics, and blue‑chip chains that already clear billions in volume. In other words, you’re looking for tokens that either power the rails or make those rails useful to normal users. With that lens, three names stand out right now: PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) as a mine‑to‑earn memecoin that gamifies infrastructure themes, SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) as an AI‑first creator economy play, and BNB ($BNB) as the blue‑chip chain asset that already benefits when stablecoin and AI activity hits scale. 1. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) – Mine‑to‑Earn Memecoin for Retail Rails If BlackRock is leaning into AI and stablecoins as macro ‘mega forces,’ PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) tries to package that institutional thesis into something the retail market actually wants to touch: a gamified, mine‑to‑earn memecoin that runs entirely on virtual infrastructure instead of real‑world rigs. Think of it as a playful UX layer on top of serious Ethereum rails. Billed as the world’s first mine-to-earn memecoin, $PEPENODE lets you acquire and customize virtual Miner Nodes, upgrade digital facilities, and earn rewards in meme assets like $PEPE and $FARTCOIN. There’s no hardware to assemble, no electricity bill, and no hash‑rate charts to decode – the ‘mining’ is abstracted into a dashboard that looks more like a mobile game than a mining pool. Under the hood, $PEPENODE is a standard ERC‑20 on Ethereum’s proof‑of‑stake network, with smart contracts handling staking logic, node‑tier rewards, and governance hooks. The market seems to be noticing. The PEPENODE presale has already raised over $2.26M, with $PEPENODE currently priced at $0.0011778 – a sub‑penny entry point for a concept aiming to sit at the intersection of mining narratives, meme culture, and Ethereum yield. Given the project’s meme potential and utility proposition, our price prediction for $PEPENODE considers a potential 2026 target of $0.0072 for a corresponding ROI of 511%. The coin could permeate into the mainstream by 2030, which could push it to $0.0244 and an ROI of 1,971% based on today’s price. Join the $PEPENODE presale to get your mining nodes early. 2. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – AI Creator Stack for the Stablecoin Era If BlackRock is right that AI will be a core driver of earnings growth, creator platforms built natively around AI tooling and crypto payments are a logical downstream bet. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is targeting exactly that intersection: Web3 rails plus AI workflows for an $85 billion‑plus content creation industry. SUBBD Token’s pitch is straightforward: give creators AI‑powered assistants, voice cloning, and even full AI influencer generation, while keeping fees low and control of earnings and IP in the creator’s hands. Instead of surrendering margins to Web2 platforms, creators can token‑gate content, accept crypto – including stablecoins – and automate fan interactions using an AI personal assistant that runs 24/7. On‑chain, SUBBD leans on its native token for payments, access, and incentives. The presale has already raised $1.38M, with $SUBBD priced at $0.0571, signaling meaningful early demand for an AI‑centric creator stack that doesn’t rely on YouTube or TikTok economics. From a marketing perspective, the project is already ahead of the curve after contracting the top 2,000+ content creators, bringing a combined following of 250M+. Based on the project’s presale performance and innovative factor, a realistic price prediction for $SUBBD suggests a 2026 target of $0.48. Make that $2.50 by 2030, once the ecosystem sees mainstream adoption. In terms of raw numbers, we’re looking at ROIs of 740% and 4,278% respectively. In a world where stablecoins become the default internet money and AI handles more of the creative workload, platforms like SUBBD sit in a sweet spot: they provide the tools, take a smaller cut, and let creators plug directly into Web3 rails. If you want in, the earlier, the better. So, read our guide on how to buy $SUBBD today, while the presale is still open. Buy your $SUBBD on the official presale page. 3. BNB (BNB) – Blue‑Chip Bet on On‑Chain Activity Growth Every AI app, stablecoin payment, or mine‑to‑earn game ultimately needs a chain to live on. BNB ($BNB) is the blue‑chip way to express that view on the BNB Chain ecosystem, combining exchange utility with smart‑contract infrastructure that already handles massive throughput at low cost. BNB powers transactions, gas fees, and smart contracts across the BNB Chain, while also unlocking trading discounts and other perks within the Binance exchange ecosystem. With high‑speed, low‑cost execution, the ecosystem has become a natural hub for DeFi, NFTs, and consumer dApps that can’t tolerate Ethereum mainnet fee spikes. Token‑economically, BNB combines that utility with a deflationary burn model, where periodic token burns reduce supply over time. That dynamic has underpinned its long‑term performance and helped keep BNB consistently in the top five cryptocurrencies by market cap as one of the leading exchange‑backed and smart‑contract platform tokens. $BNB is now trading at $910 after a 2.13% pump of the last week and a bullish behavior. If you want a large‑cap way to play the growth of AI apps and stablecoin flows on BNB Chain, $BNB remains the go‑to asset. Learn more about the ecosystem via its official website before buying. Get your $BNB on Binance today while it’s hot. Recap: As AI and stablecoins solidify into institutional ‘mega forces,’ PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) , and BNB ($BNB) offer three very different but complementary angles – gamified mine‑to‑earn, AI creator infrastructure, and a blue‑chip chain. This isn’t financial advice. DYOR and manage risks wisely before investing.

Traders are watching this level, as a breakout could push the price toward the $2.75 area. Current movement remains inside a descending channel that has shaped price action since early October. $2.28 Level Holds the Breakout Key Analyst Ali Martinez outlined the $2.28 zone as a major resistance level. It aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement and the upper edge of the descending channel. The area has rejected the price several times in recent weeks. Martinez stated , “If $XRP can break past $2.28, a breakout toward $2.75 opens up.” Notably, the $2.75 zone also aligns with the 0.236 Fibonacci level and a previous support level that may now act as resistance. Above that, the price could face pressure near $2.90 to $3.00. If XRP is rejected again at $2.28, it may retest the lower support range around $2.05 or $1.87. XRP Price Chart 04.12. Source: Ali Martinez/X Meanwhile, XRP has tracked the broader market. During the December 1 pullback, the asset dropped from $2.20 to below $2.00 before recovering. At the time of writing, XRP trades at $2.17, down 1% in the last 24 hours and 1% over the past week. The 24-hour range has stayed between $2.15 and $2.21. CRYPTOWZRD noted a slightly bullish close on the daily chart. “If it holds above the $2.277 resistance target, I am expecting another long opportunity,” they said. If rejected at that level, the analyst expects the market to move sideways. Support is seen near $2.08. Oversold Conditions and Wallet Activity Analyst Steph Is Crypto pointed to the Stochastic RSI on the weekly chart, which is back in oversold territory. Previous lows in this zone have often marked the end of short-term downtrends. Several prior signals at this level were followed by strong recoveries. In parallel, on-chain activity has picked up. Crypto commenter Amonyx reported an increase in XRP velocity, describing it as a sign of “ rising liquidity and heavy trader or whale movement .” Data from CryptoQuant supports this view. As CryptoPotato reported , wallets holding 1M to 10M XRP reduced their holdings by 150M tokens, continuing a pattern seen since September. In addition to these market shifts, a new protocol called Firelight has launched , offering XRP holders the ability to stake tokens while securing on-chain protection. Built by Sentora and supported by Flare Network, the platform uses the FAssets system to bring XRP into DeFi environments. In a separate development, RLUSD gained approval for use within the Abu Dhabi Global Market. The stablecoin now has a clearer path to adoption among regulated firms in the region.

While this situation revived bear market rhetoric, it also came to the fore that the biggest institutional Bitcoin bull, Strategy, was selling BTC. Strategy Prepares for Bitcoin Bear Market! While Michael Saylor denied these sales claims, CryptoQuant said that Strategy was preparing for a bear market. CryptoQuant stated that Strategy established a cash reserve of approximately $1.44 billion this week to cover dividends and debt interest, The Block reported. CryptoQuant stated that this cash reserve is a signal that the company is preparing for a bear market, and that this dual reserve model, which includes both the US dollar and Bitcoin, reduces the risk of forced Bitcoin sales during economic recession periods. At this point, CryptoQuant Research Head Julio Moreno emphasized that the Strategy's creation of a US dollar reserve indicates a high probability of sales, but still, the sale would be a last resort and the company would primarily focus on Bitcoin derivatives. Strategy CFO’su Andrew Kang ise, ABD doları rezervinin, mNAV>1 olduğunda oluşturulacak bir likidite risk yönetimi aracı olduğunu; BTC’nin mevcut 93,500 dolar seviyesinde, şirketin faaliyetlerini ve temettülerini 3 yıldan fazla sürdürebileceğini ve BTC satışlarının yalnızca son çare olarak kullanılabileceğini söyledi. The Bear Market Has Already Started! Claiming that the bear market period started in early November, CryptoQuant’s Julio Moreno stated that if the bear market continues, they expect the BTC price to trade in the $70,000-$55,000 range next year.

As USD/INR breaks the 90 mark, global banking giant UBS has dramatically lifted its forecasts, signaling a potential paradigm shift in currency dynamics. This development carries significant implications for investors, traders, and anyone with exposure to emerging market currencies. Why Did USD/INR Break the 90 Mark? The USD/INR pair’s breach of the 90 level represents more than just a numerical milestone. This movement reflects complex macroeconomic forces at play. Several factors have converged to push the rupee to this level: Diverging monetary policies between the US Federal Reserve and Reserve Bank of India Persistent trade deficit pressures on India’s current account Global risk aversion driving capital flows toward safe-haven assets Elevated crude oil prices impacting India’s import bill The forex market has been anticipating this move for months, but the timing and magnitude have surprised many analysts. The breach of this technical level often triggers algorithmic trading and can lead to accelerated movements as stop-loss orders are triggered. UBS Forecast Revision: What Changed? UBS, one of the world’s leading financial institutions, has significantly revised its outlook for the Indian rupee. Their analysts now project further weakness in the currency, citing several key factors: Previous Forecast Revised Forecast Key Drivers Stable around 88-89 range Potential move toward 92-93 Policy divergence, external imbalances Gradual depreciation Accelerated weakness Global dollar strength, risk aversion The UBS forecast revision is particularly significant because the bank has traditionally maintained a balanced view on emerging market currencies. Their shift toward a more pessimistic outlook reflects changing global dynamics and specific challenges facing the Indian economy. Understanding Rupee Volatility in Current Market Conditions Rupee volatility has increased substantially in recent months, creating both risks and opportunities for market participants. The currency’s movement beyond the 90 level against the US dollar represents heightened sensitivity to several factors: Global dollar index movements and Federal Reserve policy signals Domestic inflation trends and RBI policy responses Foreign institutional investment flows into Indian markets Geopolitical developments affecting emerging market sentiment This increased volatility requires careful risk management from both corporate treasuries and individual investors with exposure to Indian assets. RBI Policy Response and Market Implications The Reserve Bank of India faces a complex balancing act as the USD/INR continues its upward trajectory. The central bank’s policy decisions will significantly influence the currency’s path forward: The RBI policy toolkit includes several instruments to manage currency volatility: Direct intervention in the forex market through dollar sales Adjustments to interest rates to influence capital flows Regulatory measures affecting foreign investment flows Communication strategies to guide market expectations Market participants are closely watching for signs of how aggressively the RBI will defend specific levels and what this means for broader monetary policy. Actionable Insights for Forex Market Participants Navigating the current forex market environment requires strategic thinking and disciplined execution. Here are key considerations for different types of market participants: For corporate treasuries: Review hedging strategies and consider increasing coverage ratios Evaluate natural hedging opportunities through operational adjustments Monitor RBI communication for policy direction signals For investors and traders: Assess portfolio exposure to rupee-denominated assets Consider diversification strategies across currency pairs Implement strict risk management protocols given elevated volatility FAQs: Understanding the USD/INR Movement What does USD/INR breaking 90 mean for Indian imports and exports? A higher USD/INR rate makes Indian exports more competitive in global markets but increases the cost of imports, particularly crucial commodities like oil and electronics. How reliable are UBS forecasts for currency movements? UBS maintains one of the most respected research teams in global finance, though all forecasts involve uncertainty. Their revised outlook reflects comprehensive analysis of macroeconomic trends. What tools does the Reserve Bank of India have to manage currency volatility? The Reserve Bank of India can intervene directly in forex markets, adjust interest rates, implement capital controls, and use communication to guide expectations. How does this affect foreign investment in Indian markets? Currency depreciation can enhance returns for foreign investors when converted back to their home currency, but increased volatility may concern some institutional investors. What should individual investors with exposure to India consider? Review currency exposure in international portfolios, consider hedging strategies, and monitor both global dollar trends and domestic Indian economic indicators. Conclusion: Navigating the New Forex Reality The breach of the 90 level in USD/INR represents a watershed moment for India’s currency markets. With UBS revising forecasts upward and the RBI facing complex policy decisions, market participants must adapt to a new reality of elevated volatility and shifting dynamics. The coming months will test the resilience of India’s economic fundamentals and the effectiveness of policy responses. Those who understand these interconnected forces—global dollar strength, domestic policy constraints, and shifting capital flows—will be best positioned to navigate the challenges and opportunities ahead.

The sharp increase signals a possible increase in on-chain economic activity and transactions for a brief period. XRP showed signs of becoming more active in the short term, as network velocity rose to a yearly high. The spike in activity follows a slow period, driven by low sentiment from retail users. Ripple’s ledger velocity spiked to a yearly high, driven by whale re-accumulation, as well as the recent launch of a liquid staking platform for XRP tokens. | Source: CryptoQuant . The surge signified increased usage of XRP coins, changing hands between market participants. Recent interest in XRP increased as Ripple received a payment service license in Singapore, as Cryptopolitan reported earlier. The metric may reflect whale activity or shifts between wallets. On-chain movements also correlate with potential liquidity inflows, or preparation for more active trading. The spike in on-chain activity follows a relatively subdued period for XRP, coinciding with a stagnant market price. XRP shows signs of whales re-entering the market XRP has been trading in a tight range, currently recovered to $2.17. The asset easily climbs above $2 following downturns, and once again sparks hopes of a recovery. In 2025, XRP was mostly pressured by whale selling, while retail absorbed the supply, awaiting a bigger breakout. However, retail was left with underwater assets, once again waiting for months with sideways trading. The recent spike in on-chain activity followed data for new whale buying. The shift suggests whales may be re-accumulating XRP at a lower range, preparing for another breakout. XRP exchange reserves also deflated in the past two months, from over 3B tokens on Binance, down to 2.6B. There is not yet a supply crunch, but add to the signs of accumulation. Recently, a wave of new wallets bought 77M XRP on the open market in a single day. On-chain reshuffling of XRP wealth also indicates whales repositioning. Based on Messari data, XRP mindshare remains at 1.3%, with significant social media presence for a legacy token. Recently, mindshare increased by 22%, showing the on-chain movement coincided with more hype around the asset. XRP open interest increased in the past two days, from lows of $1.23B up to $1.39B , signaling an expectation of a directional move. XRP moves after Firelight liquid staking launch One of the immediate reasons for a shift in XRP activity was the launch of the Firelight liquid staking protocol. The feature opens up XRP liquid staking, creating a new DeFi token based on XRP reserves. Firelight uses Flare Network to bridge XRP and create a new form of liquid staking token. Flare Network has surpassed XRPL in terms of DeFi growth, and will now become one of the venues for XRP usage. Firelight converts $FXRP , wrapped through @FlareNetworks ’ trust-minimized FAssets bridge, into productive security. Users deposit into a single launch vault for $stXRP and Firelight Points. $stXRP is fully fungible and usable across DEXs, lending, and yield markets on Flare. pic.twitter.com/6cSTaPdA2D — Firelight (@Firelightfi) November 21, 2025 The liquid staking upgrade is yet to show sustainable adoption. Simple staking brings passive income, but other DeFi use cases for stXRP are riskier and may involve losing the entire stake to liquidation. XRP was one of the tokens with multiple early passive holders, who expected the asset would be used for fueling a growing distributed ledger. Native DeFi apps on the XRPL network are growing very slowly compared to other chains, with only $73M in value locked.

Source: TradingView While it looks as though the $BTC price is in the process of getting rejected from the $94,000 horizontal resistance level, the bulls are still clinging above the main downtrend line. If the bulls were able to stay above this trendline it would be a major coup, and the climb back to the highs could begin in earnest. However, price movements often follow a tortuous path, and with short-term Stochastic RSI indicator lines topping out, the all-important upside momentum could be about to fall away. In fact, this is the higher probability at this time. It can be seen that the price retested the underside of the ascending channel (in blue), and so unless the price climbs back into the channel again, this was likely a confirmation of the channel breakdown. Therefore, it looks as though the bulls are about to step back in and take the price lower. Probably the best scenario for the bulls would be for a retest of the descending trendline (middle of chart). Other than that, there is still the possibility that the price could fall back to $86,000 and the major trendline again. W pattern could take $BTC price to $103,000 Source: TradingView A W pattern is still very much in play, as can be seen in the daily time frame. The pattern is still lacking a confirmation of the neckline, but if it does play out, the measured move would be to at least $103,000. The Stochastic RSI is at the top in this time frame, but upside price momentum is still being signalled. At the bottom of the chart, the RSI indicator is heading up after retesting the breakout of the downtrend. $BTC price in huge wedge: breakout in next week or two? Source: TradingView After breaking out of an 8-month bull flag back in November 2024, the price rose sharply and then started to form what became a falling wedge, which was five months in the making. This then broke out in its turn and the price rose again, forming what was to become an even bigger falling wedge. This wedge is now more than seven months in the making, and a breakout, perhaps as early as next week or the week after, is a distinct possibility. Meanwhile, the Stochastic RSI indicators are rising up from the bottom. It may only be another week or two before they both cross above the 20.00 line. This is likely to signal the big upside price momentum that could send $BTC back to the all-time high. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The S&P BDM Index, maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices, tracks the performance of digital assets that meet defined criteria for liquidity, market capitalization, governance, transparency, and risk management. WBT’s inclusion reflects its eligibility under these standards and its growing trading presence. Broader index representation Alongside the BDM Index, WBT has been included in four additional S&P digital asset benchmarks: the S&P Cryptocurrency Broad Digital Asset (BDA) Index, the S&P Cryptocurrency Financials Index, the S&P Cryptocurrency LargeCap Ex-MegaCap Index, and the S&P Cryptocurrency LargeCap Index. These indices focus on digital assets that demonstrate sustained liquidity and consistent market capitalization over multiple quarters. “Being recognized by S&P DJI is more than an index inclusion — it signals that crypto infrastructure from our region has reached global institutional standards,” said Volodymyr Nosov , CEO of WhiteBIT “This is a turning point not only for our company but also for the evolution of compliant crypto services worldwide.” Institutional visibility and recent performance Inclusion in the S&P indices introduces WBT into broader benchmark structures used by investment firms, exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) and exchange-traded note (ETN) designers, and research platforms. This allows the token to be referenced within institutional performance models and portfolio construction tools. The addition follows a period of steady price performance, with WBT reaching a new all-time high of $62.96 on November 18, 2025. The token’s liquidity and trading stability were cited as key factors in its eligibility under S&P’s classification framework. According to WhiteBIT, the move provides WBT with clearer market benchmarking and could support its use in future investment products tied to indexed digital assets. Featured image via WhiteBIT.

UK’s New Law Sets Criteria For Digital Assets The creation of this dedicated legal category for digital assets followed recommendations from the Law Commission, which advocated for a framework that acknowledges assets not fitting traditional definitions of personal property. This legal evolution is seen as part of a broader strategy to position the UK as a leading digital finance hub, responding to experts’ calls for the country to align its regulatory environment with that of the United States in order to promote growth in the digital asset market. According to law firm Clyde & Co, a key provision in the law states that “a thing (including a thing that is digital or electronic in nature) is not prevented from being the object of personal property rights merely because it is neither (a) a thing in possession, nor (b) a thing in action.” This phrase confirms that digital assets can now be recognized as a third category of personal property, distinct from the traditional classifications of tangible and intangible assets. However, the Act does not guarantee that any specific type of asset qualifies as personal property; rather, it aims to “unlock” the common law’s ability to adapt to technological advancements and new asset types, as outlined in the Explanatory Notes from Parliament. The interpretation of existing digital assets—such as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs)—as well as any emerging forms will ultimately depend on future court rulings. The law firm also noted that, under this new law, a digital asset must meet certain criteria to qualify as personal property: it must be definable and identifiable by third parties and capable of being assumed by them, as well as possess a degree of permanence. Additionally, digital assets will be included in bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings, allowing them to be treated as part of the overall asset pool available to creditors and heirs. Government Moves To Ban Crypto Donations While momentum continues for digital asset recognition, the UK government is also addressing concerns surrounding cryptocurrency in the political sphere. Ministers are reportedly working on legislation aimed at banning political donations made through digital currencies, although this crackdown may not be ready in time for the upcoming elections bill in the new year. Officials have raised alarms that cryptocurrency donations pose risks to the integrity of the electoral process, primarily due to their difficult-to-trace nature, which could open the door to exploitation by foreign entities or criminal organizations. At the time of writing, the market’s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was trading at $92,180, surging 4% in the past 24 hours.

He is eager to drive strategic innovation and product development that will propel MEXC into its next stage of global leadership. “I have closely followed MEXC’s growth over the past four years, and it is a privilege to join at such a pivotal moment for both the company and the global crypto industry,” said Vugar Usi. “MEXC is a rising global underdog powered by relentless innovation, rapid expansion, and sustained momentum across international markets. What truly sets the company apart for me is its deep, mission-driven DNA. As the new Chief Operating Officer, my focus is not on incremental change, but on fundamentally raising the standard for what a global, retail-first exchange should represent.

My role is to help scale that mission globally through operational excellence, responsible market expansion, and a regulatory-first approach that strengthens trust across the entire ecosystem.” MEXC’s appointment of Vugar Usi as the architect of its next phase signals its evolution from hypergrowth to true industry leadership—charged with amplifying momentum, challenging the status quo, and translating its retail-first, standards-driven mission into a new global benchmark for compliant, performance-led crypto adoption.

The recovery comes just after crypto analyst CasiTrades published a detailed technical outlook on the social media platform X, where she outlined a scenario that anticipated both the initial decline and the current bounce. Now that XRP has begun moving upward towards $2.2, the focus is on what the next phase of this pattern could bring next. Subwave 3 Targets Hit As Structure Plays Out CasiTrades explained that XRP’s early-December drop was part of a subwave 2 setup that had been discussed during her previous livestream. When XRP fell to $2.03 in early December, it confirmed the transition into a subwave 3 extension, and the next projected target sat near $1.90. That level was important not only as a Fibonacci extension but also because it corresponded with Bitcoin reaching its macro 0.382 level around the $79,000 region. Related Reading: Are Dogecoin Whales Leaving The Meme Coin? Large Transactions Crash To 2-Month Lows The chart attached to her analysis illustrated this path clearly. A sequence of orange, pink, and black wave structures converged toward the same support region, all pointing toward $1.90 as the initial landing zone. As shown in the chart image below, there’s another green accumulation block between $1.80 and $1.64 as the deeper support level that could still come into play. XRP Chart Analysis. Source: @CasiTrades On X At the time of her analysis, selling pressure was already slowing down, and momentum indicators like the RSI were building a bullish divergence. Since then, XRP’s price action has turned bullish, and this supports the idea that a reaction was always likely to occur in the $1.90 zone. CasiTrades noted that once the price reached this level, she expected a bounce back toward $2.04 to retest resistance for a new Wave 4 formation. Over the past few days, XRP has done exactly that, rising from its lows and reclaiming momentum as buyers returned. Two Final Scenarios Still In Play For XRP According to CasiTrades, there are two possible outcomes for the XRP price against the backdrop of retesting $2.04. The first outcome is a double bottom forming around the $1.80 to $1.88 region, depending on the exchange. The chart she shared includes a mid-range support box that captures this possibility, with wave markings showing how price could rotate downward before a larger breakout. Related Reading: Here’s What To Expect If The XRP Price Holds $2 The second potential outcome is a deeper sweep to $1.64, which is based on the macro 0.618 support. This zone forms the lower boundary of the green accumulation block on her chart, representing the final area where a full Wave 2 or Wave C completion could occur before XRP attempts a larger impulsive breakout.

While ADA continues to struggle, a rising new crypto priced at $0.035 is closing in on a full 99% allocation and gaining strong momentum across the market. Many traders now wonder whether Cardano can recover soon, or whether a newer DeFi project is about to take the spotlight. Cardano (ADA) Cardano is currently trading near $0.43, with a market cap close to $15B. While ADA remains one of the better-known altcoins, its recent price action has been disappointing. Cardano once delivered strong surges during earlier bull cycles, but that momentum has faded this year. ADA continues to face heavy resistance. The token remains stuck below the $0.47 to $0.50 range, where sellers repeatedly reject upward movement. Even its higher resistance zone near $0.70 to $0.85 has been unreachable for months. Without stronger volume or fresh catalysts, ADA’s path to recovery remains unclear. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining attention fast as one of the most promising DeFi crypto entries for 2026. Instead of relying on hype or speculation, the project is developing a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol focused on stability, strong collateral systems and predictable returns. Mutuum Finance supports advanced borrowing mechanics, mtTokens that grow in value as interest accumulates, liquidation tools and accurate pricing systems. These features create a safer environment for users and help distinguish the project from many early-stage altcoins. According to the official Mutuum Finance X account , V1 will launch on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. This version will include the liquidity pool, mtTokens, the liquidation bot and the debt-tracking token, with ETH and USDT supported from day one. Security is one of the biggest reasons investors are paying attention. The project is undergoing a full review by Halborn Security , one of the most respected blockchain security firms. Their involvement gives Mutuum Finance a higher level of trust at a time when many new projects skip thorough auditing. With developing utility, strong development progress and confirmed security oversight, Mutuum Finance is now being viewed as one of the top crypto newcomers in DeFi. User Activity and Fast Adoption Mutuum Finance began its offering at $0.01 in early 2025. Today, the price has risen to $0.035, marking a 250% increase during its early development stage. The project has already raised $19M and expanded to 18,200 holders, reflecting rapid growth across several months. Out of the 4B total supply, 1.82B tokens are allocated to the offering. More than 800M tokens have already been purchased. The offering is now in Phase 6, which is 99% allocated, leaving only a tiny portion left under $0.04. Mutuum Finance also keeps its community active through a 24-hour leaderboard, where the daily top contributor earns $500 in MUTM. This helps drive daily engagement and attract consistent participation. The project supports direct card payments, making it simple for new users to join without needing complex setup steps. This accessibility has allowed more first-time buyers to enter during the later stages, increasing daily inflow. With allocation levels shrinking fast, the remaining supply is moving quicker than any previous stage. Why Many Investors Believe MUTM Has Higher Upside Cardano already carries a market cap in the billions. This makes large surges difficult. ADA cannot repeat its early explosive rallies unless large amounts of new liquidity enter the market. MUTM, priced at $0.035, is still early and has far more room to grow. Cardano is a respected blockchain, but its slow development pace has discouraged some investors. On the other hand, Mutuum Finance is delivering lending tools, mtTokens that generate real yield, and a buy-and-distribute model that creates ongoing buy pressure. A portion of the platform’s revenue buys MUTM on the open market, and MUTM purchased on the open market is redistributed to users who stake mtTokens in the safety module. This provides long-term value that ADA does not currently offer. Many early ADA supporters are now turning toward rising new crypto entries like MUTM after seeing how quickly its offering is being consumed. With V1 launching in Q4 2025, investors expect strong visibility for the platform before the token reaches exchanges. This timing has pushed more ADA investors to add MUTM to their portfolios before the final phase sells out. Whale Allocation and Urgency Phase 6 is now at 99% allocation, and only a very small number of tokens remain at $0.035. This stage has accelerated dramatically in recent days, driven by growing exposure and strong social momentum. A recent $115K whale allocation pushed Phase 6 even closer to completion. Whale entries at this stage usually signal strong confidence in the project’s progress and future potential. Smaller investors often follow these large entries, increasing allocation speed even more. With demand rising and supply shrinking, buyers believe this may be the final chance to secure MUTM at a sub-$0.04 price. As Mutuum Finance prepares for its V1 release, expands its community and moves toward its launch value of $0.06, urgency among early investors is now higher than at any point during the offering. Cardano is struggling with resistance levels, slower growth and a shrinking outlook. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance has surged 250%, raised $19M, built a community of 18,200 holders and pushed Phase 6 to 99% allocation. With strong DeFi utility, security audits, rising demand and whale activity increasing, MUTM is becoming one of the top cryptocurrencies to watch going into 2026. With Phase 6 almost gone, the remaining supply at $0.035 may disappear far sooner than expected.

Imagine waking up in 2025 to discover your PEPE memecoin investment has multiplied tenfold. The green frog that started as an internet joke now commands serious attention in cryptocurrency circles. As we look toward the future, one question dominates discussions: Can PEPE, born from meme culture, actually reach the elusive 1 cent mark? This comprehensive PEPE price prediction examines the realistic possibilities for 2025 through 2030, separating hype from genuine potential in the volatile world of memecoins. Understanding PEPE’s Current Market Position The PEPE memecoin emerged during the 2023 memecoin frenzy, riding the wave of nostalgia for the original Pepe the Frog internet meme. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies with complex technological foundations, PEPE’s value proposition rests entirely on community sentiment and cultural relevance. This makes PEPE price prediction particularly challenging, as its valuation depends more on social media trends than fundamental blockchain utility. Currently, PEPE faces several critical challenges that impact any long-term forecast: Extreme volatility typical of memecoins Dependence on broader cryptocurrency market sentiment Competition from thousands of other memecoins Regulatory uncertainty surrounding meme-based assets Limited real-world utility beyond speculative trading PEPE Price Prediction 2025: The First Major Test By 2025, the cryptocurrency market will have undergone another full cycle since PEPE’s creation. Our PEPE price prediction for this period considers several key factors. If the broader crypto market enters a bull phase similar to 2021, PEPE could see significant appreciation based purely on risk-on sentiment. However, reaching even $0.001 would require massive market cap growth that seems improbable given current tokenomics. Scenario Price Range Probability Required Market Cap Bear Market $0.0000005 – $0.000001 30% $200M – $400M Neutral Market $0.000001 – $0.000002 50% $400M – $800M Bull Market $0.000002 – $0.000005 20% $800M – $2B PEPE Coin Future: 2026-2028 Projections The PEPE coin future between 2026 and 2028 depends heavily on whether the project evolves beyond its meme origins. Successful memecoins like Dogecoin managed this transition by developing real utility and community projects. For PEPE to maintain relevance, developers must introduce innovative features that add tangible value beyond speculation. Key developments that could positively impact PEPE price prediction during this period include: Integration with decentralized finance platforms Partnerships with mainstream brands or influencers Development of NFT collections or gaming applications Token burning mechanisms to reduce supply Enhanced community governance structures Cryptocurrency Forecast: The 1 Cent Question for 2030 Now we reach the ultimate question in our cryptocurrency forecast: Can PEPE reach 1 cent by 2030? The mathematics reveals the staggering challenge. With PEPE’s current circulating supply, a $0.01 price would require a market capitalization exceeding most established cryptocurrencies today. This seems implausible without either massive token burning or unprecedented adoption that transcends memecoin status. More realistic cryptocurrency forecast scenarios for 2030 include: Moderate success: $0.00001 – $0.00005 range Breakout scenario: $0.0001 – $0.0005 with major utility development Memecoin winter: Near-zero valuation if community interest fades Memecoin Analysis: What History Teaches Us Our memecoin analysis reveals important patterns from similar projects. Dogecoin’s journey from joke to mainstream acceptance provides both inspiration and caution. While DOGE achieved remarkable growth, it required years of development, celebrity endorsements from figures like Elon Musk, and continuous community building. Shiba Inu demonstrated that second-mover memecoins can also achieve significant valuations through aggressive marketing and ecosystem development. For PEPE to follow similar trajectories, this memecoin analysis suggests several necessary conditions: Sustained cultural relevance beyond initial hype cycle Development team commitment through multiple market cycles Successful differentiation from competing memecoins Adaptation to changing regulatory landscapes Continuous innovation in token utility and applications Factors That Could Transform PEPE’s Trajectory While our PEPE price prediction remains cautious about the 1 cent target, several developments could dramatically alter the outlook. Mainstream exchange listings, particularly on platforms like Coinbase, typically provide significant price boosts. Major influencer endorsements or celebrity adoption could replicate the Elon Musk effect seen with Dogecoin. Technological integration with emerging Web3 platforms or metaverse projects could provide the utility foundation PEPE currently lacks. The most promising development would be the PEPE community transitioning from pure speculation to building genuine utility. This could include: Decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance Charity initiatives leveraging the PEPE brand Educational resources about cryptocurrency Cross-chain compatibility and interoperability Merchant adoption for payments Risks and Challenges in PEPE Investment No PEPE price prediction would be complete without addressing the substantial risks. Memecoins represent the most speculative segment of cryptocurrency investing, with many projects fading into obscurity after initial hype. Regulatory crackdowns on meme-based assets remain a constant threat, particularly as governments worldwide increase cryptocurrency oversight. The sheer number of competing memecoins creates constant dilution risk, where new projects attract attention and capital away from established tokens. Investors should consider these critical questions: What differentiates PEPE from hundreds of similar memecoins? Does the development team have long-term commitment? How will PEPE maintain relevance during crypto bear markets? What percentage of your portfolio should risk assets occupy? Do you have an exit strategy for extreme volatility scenarios? Actionable Insights for PEPE Investors Based on our comprehensive analysis, here are actionable insights for those considering PEPE investment: Treat PEPE as high-risk speculation, not long-term investment Allocate only capital you can afford to lose completely Monitor community development and utility progress regularly Set clear profit-taking and loss-limitation strategies Diversify across cryptocurrency sectors beyond memecoins Stay informed about regulatory developments affecting meme assets Participate in community governance if available FAQs About PEPE Price Prediction What is the realistic PEPE price prediction for 2025? Most analysts suggest a range between $0.000001 and $0.000005, depending largely on broader market conditions and community development progress. Can PEPE actually reach 1 cent by 2030? While mathematically possible, reaching $0.01 would require unprecedented adoption and utility development that currently seems improbable based on the project’s trajectory. How does PEPE compare to Dogecoin? PEPE lacks the mainstream recognition and celebrity endorsements that propelled Dogecoin , though it benefits from stronger internet meme origins. Unlike DOGE, which gained attention from figures like Elon Musk , PEPE remains primarily a community-driven project. What exchanges list PEPE for trading? PEPE is available on several major exchanges including Binance , Kraken , and Coinbase , though availability varies by region due to regulatory considerations. Who created the PEPE memecoin? The PEPE memecoin was launched by an anonymous development team, continuing the tradition of decentralized, community-focused cryptocurrency projects. The original Pepe the Frog character was created by artist Matt Furie . Conclusion: The Realistic Outlook for PEPE The journey from internet meme to serious cryptocurrency contender represents one of the most fascinating narratives in digital assets. While our PEPE price prediction acknowledges the mathematical improbability of reaching 1 cent, the possibility of significant appreciation remains if the project evolves beyond its origins. The true value of PEPE, like all memecoins, ultimately depends on community strength, development innovation, and market timing.

In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and only a month ago, it hit an ATH of $126K, a 641% in six years and 629,900% in 14 years. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. Arthur Hayes just predicted $BTC to hit $200K by the end of 2025 , and Saylor is doubling down on Bitcoin despite the crypto’s slump to under $85K. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. If you’re looking for the newest insights on Bitcoin, you’re in the right place.

Bitcoin ETF Euphoria Steers Bitcoin Liquidity Toward Bitcoin Hyper’s Layer-2 Bet December 4, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Bitcoin has bounced from $84K to around $93K in a 7% move while analysts map a path toward $120K, as long as the five-day streak of $58.5M in daily spot Bitcoin ETF inflows holds. BlackRock’s IBIT alone added $120.1M in one day, which shows that the marginal buyer is now an ETF, not a degen on leverage. That kind of regulated demand keeps $BTC structurally bid and pushes more value onto the base chain over time. As more volume and capital move through Bitcoin, blockspace and fees trend higher, and the trade shifts from hoarding coins to owning the rails that keep the network usable. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is that rails play. It is a Bitcoin Layer-2 built on the Solana Virtual Machine, using a canonical bridge so you can move $BTC into an environment with fast execution and Solana-style dApp support while still anchored to Bitcoin’s brand and security. Explore Bitcoin Hyper’s presale in our guide. BlackRock’s Bitcoin-Aware ‘Mega Forces’ Narrative Aligns With SUBBD Token’s Creator Economy Push December 4, 2025 • 10:00 UTC BlackRock’s latest outlook stays risk-on and leans into ‘mega forces’ like AI, tokenization, and stablecoins, arguing these trends will reshape markets over the next decade rather than just fuel a short-term pump. With $BTC trading near $93K and stablecoins at a multi-hundred-billion-dollar market cap, capital clearly prefers programmable rails over legacy intermediaries. That backdrop rewards projects where real economic activity, not just speculation, settles on-chain. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) fits that lane by turning the $85B creator economy into an on-chain, AI-powered subscription stack. The platform uses an ERC-20 token to handle subscriptions, tipping, and staking, while AI tools automate fan engagement and content flows, so value accrues to creators and holders instead of Web2 middlemen. With $1.38M already raised at a presale price of $0.0571, you step into an early-stage play that sits exactly where BlackRock expects structural growth: AI, payments, and Bitcoin-adjacent on-chain liquidity. Here’s how to buy $SUBBD now.

His commentary centers on the shift in holdings across centralized exchanges and newly launched exchange-traded products. The analyst frames the situation as a transfer of wealth occurring in real time, shaped by sentiment, timing, and the introduction of new investment vehicles. XRP Transfer Of Wealth pic.twitter.com/PCbOZbTL1X — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) December 2, 2025 Retail Outflows and Market Sentiment According to Rector, November presented a clear example of how retail sentiment can influence short-term market activity. He stated that approximately $808 million worth of XRP was removed from centralized exchanges during the month. He explained that many individual holders were convinced that the upward trajectory for XRP had already completed. Rector attributed this reaction to what he described as deliberate efforts by market makers to create an impression that momentum had faded. This perception caused retail investors to sell their holdings, responding to fear and uncertainty rather than broader market structure. Institutional Inflows Into Exchange-Traded Products Rector contrasted this retail activity with a different trend among institutional participants. He emphasized that during the same period, particularly in the latter half of November, approximately 365 million XRP moved into exchange-traded products. This coincided with the introduction of the Canary ETF , which launched on November 13. He noted that applying a price of $2.20 per XRP to that inflow places the value of institutional accumulation at approximately $800 million. In his view, this signifies that while retail investors were exiting positions, institutional entities were entering with comparable volume. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications of the Diverging Trends Rector described this parallel movement as a reflection of opposing interpretations of market conditions. Retail holders reacted to short-term signals, while institutions appeared to be positioning for longer-term exposure by securing XRP within ETF structures. He pointed out that ETF inflows effectively lock up large quantities of XRP, reducing the amount available on centralized exchanges. He stated that this dynamic represents a shift in ownership from reactive sellers to investors with a more strategic approach. Rector’s analysis presents a narrative of two groups acting in opposite directions, with retail participants reducing their exposure while institutional investors increased theirs through ETF mechanisms. His comments underscore that the developments in November should be seen within the broader context of evolving investment infrastructure for XRP. He contends that institutional adoption is becoming more visible through quantifiable inflows, even when retail sentiment appears uncertain.

As we look toward the future, one question dominates the conversation: Will DOGE reach 1 dollar? This comprehensive analysis explores Dogecoin price predictions from 2025 through 2030, examining the technical, fundamental, and market factors that could determine whether the beloved meme coin achieves this historic milestone. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Understanding the Current Landscape Before diving into future projections, we must understand Dogecoin’s current position. Unlike many cryptocurrencies with complex technological narratives, Dogecoin’s strength lies in its community and brand recognition. The coin maintains consistent trading volume and remains among the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. However, its price has shown significant volatility, influenced by social media trends, celebrity endorsements, and broader market movements. This foundation sets the stage for our Dogecoin price prediction analysis across multiple timeframes. Will DOGE Reach 1 Dollar? The Critical Factors The journey to $1 represents more than a 10x increase from current levels. Several factors will determine whether this ambitious target becomes reality: Adoption and Utility: Increased merchant acceptance and practical use cases Market Sentiment: Continued community support and social media influence Technological Development: Network upgrades and scalability improvements Regulatory Environment: Clear cryptocurrency regulations that support growth Institutional Investment: Greater participation from traditional financial entities Each of these elements must align favorably for DOGE to sustain a $1 valuation. The community-driven nature of Dogecoin means that retail investor enthusiasm remains crucial, but institutional validation could provide the stability needed for long-term growth. Dogecoin 2025: The Near-Term Outlook Our Dogecoin 2025 analysis considers both optimistic and conservative scenarios. By 2025, we expect several key developments that could influence Dogecoin’s price trajectory: Scenario Price Range Key Drivers Bullish $0.35 – $0.65 Major exchange listings, celebrity endorsements, crypto bull market Moderate $0.20 – $0.40 Steady adoption growth, moderate market conditions Conservative $0.10 – $0.25 Regulatory challenges, limited utility expansion The 2025 timeframe represents a critical testing ground for Dogecoin’s fundamentals. While reaching $1 by 2025 appears challenging under most projections, significant progress toward this goal could establish momentum for subsequent years. Dogecoin 2030: Long-Term Vision and Potential Looking further ahead, our Dogecoin 2030 forecast considers broader technological and market trends. By this timeframe, cryptocurrency integration into daily life should be more advanced, potentially benefiting established coins with strong brand recognition like Dogecoin. Several developments could dramatically influence Dogecoin’s 2030 valuation: Mainstream payment integration across major retailers Enhanced blockchain functionality through protocol upgrades Interoperability with emerging Web3 and metaverse platforms Global economic factors affecting cryptocurrency adoption rates The 2030 projection allows for more transformative changes in both technology and adoption patterns. While predictions this far into the future carry inherent uncertainty, Dogecoin’s unique position as a culturally significant cryptocurrency provides advantages that purely technical coins may lack. Cryptocurrency Forecast: How Dogecoin Fits in the Broader Market No cryptocurrency forecast exists in isolation. Dogecoin’s trajectory will inevitably connect to broader market trends. Several macro factors will influence whether DOGE can reach its $1 target: Bitcoin Dominance: As the market leader, Bitcoin’s performance sets the tone for altcoins Regulatory Clarity: Clear guidelines could boost investor confidence across the sector Technological Innovation: Advances in blockchain technology benefiting all cryptocurrencies Economic Conditions: Inflation, interest rates, and global economic stability Dogecoin’s fate remains tied to these larger forces while maintaining its unique community-driven characteristics. This dual nature creates both opportunities and challenges for long-term growth. Challenges on the Path to $1 While optimism drives much of the Dogecoin conversation, realistic analysis requires acknowledging significant challenges: Inflationary Supply: Dogecoin’s unlimited supply creates constant selling pressure Competition: Newer meme coins and established cryptocurrencies competing for attention Utility Gap: Limited technological advantages compared to programmable blockchains Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency’s inherent price swings affecting stability Addressing these challenges will require both community initiative and development team action. The inflationary supply issue, in particular, represents a fundamental economic consideration that could limit upside potential unless addressed through increased demand. Actionable Insights for Dogecoin Investors Based on our analysis, investors considering Dogecoin should consider these strategic approaches: Dollar-Cost Averaging: Regular investments to mitigate timing risk Portfolio Allocation: Limiting Dogecoin exposure to a reasonable percentage Community Engagement: Staying informed about development and adoption news Risk Management: Setting clear entry and exit strategies based on personal goals Remember that all cryptocurrency investments carry significant risk. Only invest what you can afford to lose, and consider consulting with financial professionals before making substantial commitments. Conclusion: The Road Ahead for Dogecoin The question “Will DOGE reach 1 dollar?” encapsulates both the excitement and uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency investing. Our analysis suggests that while the $1 target represents a significant challenge, it remains within the realm of possibility given favorable market conditions, continued community growth, and expanded utility. The journey will likely require patience, as immediate breakthroughs appear unlikely. However, Dogecoin’s unique cultural position and dedicated community provide advantages that purely technical cryptocurrencies often lack. As with all investments, careful research and risk management remain essential for anyone participating in Dogecoin’s ongoing story.

55340498,https://cryptonews.com/?p=459865,1764843014,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/55340498.jpeg,Senior Kremlin Official Proposes Counting Crypto Mining as Russia’s “Hidden Export”,https://cryptonews.com/news/senior-kremlin-official-proposes-counting-crypto-mining-as-russias-hidden-export/,"Crypto mining should be treated as a form of export in Russia’s official trade accounts, according to senior Kremlin official Maxim Oreshkin, who argued that large volumes of mined digital assets effectively flow abroad even if they never cross a physical border. Key Takeaways: Senior Kremlin official Maxim Oreshkin wants crypto mining to be counted as an export. Industry leaders say Russia already produces tens of thousands of Bitcoins yearly, generating roughly 1 billion rubles per day in revenue. Tighter rules now impose up to 25% corporate tax on mining income. Speaking at the Russia Calling! investment forum , Oreshkin said the industry generates “enormous sums” that remain outside formal statistics despite influencing the foreign-exchange market and the balance of payments. Russia Moves to Classify Crypto Mining as a New Export Russia legalized cryptocurrency mining on November 1, 2024, and Oreshkin described the sector as a “new export item” that the country “doesn’t value very well.” Because crypto can be used to pay for imports through alternative channels, he said, those transactions should be counted when the state measures trade flows and currency dynamics. Industry figures say the scale is already material. Oleg Ogienko, chief executive of Via Numeri Group, estimates that Russia’s output of proof-of-work assets this year could equal “tens of thousands” of Bitcoins. Sergey Bezdelov, head of the Industrial Mining Association, put production at about 55,000 BTC in 2023 and roughly 35,000 BTC in 2024, citing the network’s halving as a drag on miner rewards. #BITCOIN MINING IS NOW LEGAL IN RUSSIA pic.twitter.com/r8D0ddMMJS — The Bitcoin Conference (@TheBitcoinConf) November 1, 2024 The revenue impact is also significant. Mikhail Brezhnev, co-founder of mining supplier 51ASIC, estimates daily mining income across the country at around 1 billion rubles, a figure he links to Russia’s share of global computing power and Bitcoin’s price. Because mined coins can be used directly to settle import bills, Brezhnev says the case for recording those flows in official statistics is straightforward. Regulators, meanwhile, are tightening oversight. Legal entities and sole proprietors must register with the Federal Tax Service to mine, and hosting providers are listed in a separate registry. Household miners are exempt from registration only if they consume less than 6,000 kWh a month, though all income must be reported. Corporate mining is taxed at 25%, while individuals face progressive rates of 13–22%; non-residents pay 30%. Illegal Crypto Mining Drains Russia’s Power Grid and Tax Base As reported, a recent Russian media investigation revealed that illegal and semi-legal crypto mining is costing the country millions of dollars each year through stolen electricity and unpaid taxes. Broadcaster Ren TV reports that many miners avoid registering their operations to escape high power tariffs and tax obligations, pushing large parts of the industry into the shadows and creating billion-ruble losses for the state budget. Although Russia now permits industrial crypto mining and offers legal status to registered operators, smaller miners are reportedly refusing to comply. While major firms such as BitRiver and Intelion work within the system, many independent operators are accused of resorting to meter manipulation, bribery, and secret agreements with utility workers. As a result, households and legitimate businesses are said to be absorbing the cost of stolen electricity.

The Coinbase Premium, a key gauge of institutional and US investor sentiment, has turned positive after a prolonged slump. This shift suggests a powerful resurgence in American buying pressure for Bitcoin, potentially marking a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency’s price trajectory. For traders and long-term holders alike, understanding this signal is crucial. What Exactly is the Coinbase Premium? Before we dive into the implications, let’s clarify the metric. The Coinbase Premium is the price difference between Bitcoin on the US-based Coinbase exchange and other global exchanges like Binance. When this premium is positive, it indicates that the price on Coinbase is higher. This typically happens when buying demand from US investors—including large institutions—outpaces demand elsewhere. Think of it as a real-time sentiment barometer for American capital flowing into crypto. Why Does a Positive Coinbase Premium Matter Now? The recent shift is significant because it breaks a negative trend. Analysis from XWIN Research Japan shows the premium was in continuous decline throughout November . During that period, Bitcoin struggled below $90,000. The research firm linked this directly to weakened spot buying from US investors, even as overseas demand held steady. Historically, a negative Coinbase Premium aligns with a ‘risk-off’ mood among US market participants. Therefore, the return to positive territory is a strong counter-signal. This change implies two key developments: Renewed Institutional Confidence: US-based funds and large buyers are likely stepping back into the market. Potential Price Support: Sustained US buying can provide a solid foundation for Bitcoin’s price, countering sell pressure. Beyond the US: A Global Catalyst on the Horizon The bullish case doesn’t end with American investors. XWIN’s report highlighted another major development: the Japanese government is preparing to approve investments in spot Bitcoin ETFs. This regulatory move could unlock a massive new pool of capital. The firm projects that the launch of Bitcoin ETFs in Japan could inject between $3 billion and $10 billion in new capital into the market in the short term. Japan is a major financial hub, and approval there would signal further global legitimacy and accessibility for Bitcoin, creating a powerful one-two punch of US and Asian demand. What Should Investors and Traders Watch Next? While a positive Coinbase Premium is an encouraging sign, it’s not a standalone guarantee of a bull run. Smart market participants should monitor a few key factors: Sustainability: Is this a brief spike or a sustained shift? Watch if the premium remains positive over the coming weeks. Trading Volume: Increased buying pressure should be confirmed by rising volume on Coinbase and other US platforms. Macro Environment: Broader economic factors like interest rates and inflation still influence all risk assets, including crypto. Conclusion: A Signal Worth Your Attention The turn in the Coinbase Premium is a compelling piece of the market puzzle. It points to a resurgence of confidence from a critical player: the US investor. Coupled with the potential for massive new investment from Japan, the fundamental backdrop for Bitcoin appears to be strengthening. For anyone with skin in the crypto game, this indicator suggests it’s time to pay close attention. The winds may be shifting in favor of the bulls. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Is a positive Coinbase Premium a guaranteed buy signal? A: No single indicator is a guarantee. It’s a strong positive signal suggesting US buying pressure, but should be considered alongside volume, price action, and broader market trends. Q: How often does the Coinbase Premium change? A: It fluctuates continuously based on real-time trading activity on different exchanges. Analysts look for sustained trends rather than momentary changes. Q: Does this only affect Bitcoin? A: Primarily, yes. The Coinbase Premium specifically tracks Bitcoin (BTC). However, positive sentiment for Bitcoin often spills over into the wider cryptocurrency market. Q: Where can I check the current Coinbase Premium? A> Several cryptocurrency data analytics websites and platforms track this metric in real-time, often under “exchange flows” or “institutional indicators.” Q: What caused the premium to be negative before? A> According to analysts, it was due to weakened spot buying from US investors during a period of bearish price action and general risk-off sentiment. Q: How significant is the potential Japanese ETF approval? A> It is very significant. Japan is a major financial market, and official ETF approval would provide a regulated, accessible pathway for billions in new institutional and retail investment.

Amidst massive sell-offs by whales triggering short-term market panic, XRP prices have declined noticeably, and on-chain data shows that some large wallets are accelerating the transfer or liquidation of their holdings. This series of actions has not only put pressure on market sentiment but also forced holders to make the crucial decision of “whether to continue holding.” However, in an environment of escalating price volatility, more and more investors are choosing a path different from traditional trading—transferring a portion of their funds to the LeanHash cloud mining platform to obtain stable and immediate daily returns, thus coping with short-term market uncertainty.

Conclusion: The XRP price decline is not the end, but the beginning of a shift in investor strategies. While the price drop caused by whale selling will undoubtedly put short-term pressure on the market, investors’ choices are subtly changing: instead of panic selling or passively waiting for prices to rebound, they are choosing to create a “stable yield curve” independent of price fluctuations using LeanHash. The XRP market still has long-term potential, but during periods of volatility, stable cash flow is often more valuable. LeanHash is becoming a “second growth engine” for an increasing number of investors amidst market turmoil. ⦁ Official Website: https://leanhash.com/ ⦁ Contact Email: infot@leanhash.com ⦁ Download iOS and Android Mobile Apps",Press Release,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-04 11:27:00

According to those analysts who observe the trend across the leading crypto platforms, this is a rapidly changing momentum that might finish earlier than the expectations of the majority. This stage could determine the fate of this project as one of the potential strongest newcomers going into 2026 or not. Why the Attention is Growing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a lending protocol that is based on real on-chain usage. The system gives the user the option to deposit assets either ETH or USDT and earn as a consequence of a borrower paying an interest period in the form of a mt Token. The liquidity-based rates, transparent collateral regulations, and liquidations are used by the borrowers in such a way that they are only applicable when required to ensure that the system is risk-free. The token started cheaply at the beginning of 2025 in the range of $0.01 and has recently risen to $0.035, which indicates the 2.5x increase now attracting the attention of the analysts. The project has already raised over $19.1 million, acquired over 18,300 holders, and sold over 810 million MUTM tokens. The 4 billion overall number was divided into 1.82 billion tokens that the presale stages received. Phase 6 has nearly reached completion with the buyers filling the last slots at a very fast rate. Security Foundation and V1 Launch On its official X account, it was stated by the Mutuum Finance that in Q4 2025, V1 testnet will become active on Sepolia network. The liquidity pool, mtTokens, debt tracking, and a liquidator bot will be the initial offerings in the first release alongside ETH and USDT as the initial collateral and lending assets. One of the key reasons that the investors are giving a keen attention is security. Mutuum Finance has passed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 Token Scan rating and Halborn Security is auditing an entire suite of contracts of lending. There is a bug bounty worth 50K that will be implemented to detect the risks prior to launch. Due to an initial development progress and audited infrastructure, a number of the analysts are currently modeling a potential 5x to 7x upward development on the occasion that V1 becomes live and borrowing markets begin to gain traction. Buy-and-Distribute Pressure The key component of Mutuum Finance is the use of mTokens. Upon provision of assets by the liquidity providers, they are given mtTokens whose value grows with interest. This provides lenders with actual APY on the basis of demand and not inflation. The buy and distribute system is also applied in the protocol. A fraction of Platform revenue is used to purchase MUTM in the open market. The tokens bought are redistributed to the users, who commit mtTokens in the safety module. According to analysts, the long-term buying pressure could be generated by this mechanism when the borrowing activity is increased. As the two market forces, the yield and the buy pressure combine, some commentators of the market feel that MUTM has the potential of increasing 10x in value since it is currently at $0.035 in the first major cycle following its release. Long-Term Adoption Mutuum Finance is working on a USD-pegged interest-backed stablecoin. It will be minted and incinerated on demand, and will assist in increasing the liquidity in circulation to be lent out. According to the analysts, stablecoins tend to be the foundation of DeFi systems and this aspect can put Mutuum Finance in a vitally good position. It is also planned that the project will be deployed on several layer-2 networks. L2 scaling implies reduced charges and heightened frequency of users and aids borrowing markets to develop at a quicker rate. One of the largest indicators that analysts consider in predicting long-term performance is the multi-chain support. Chainlink feeds, fallback oracles, aggregated pricing and DEX sources will also be incorporated in Mutuum Finance in order to provide the correct valuations of the liquidations. These systems secure the users and provide a secure base on lending. Community Activity and Decreasing Supply There is still a daily influx of activity on the project due to the 24-hour leaderboard, which makes the most active user a winner of $500 in MUTM. This has assisted in ensuring constant engagement and influx throughout every stage. Phase 6 is currently on the periphery of completion. There is very little left at the bottom at $0.035, and top crypto investors note that late stages frequently sell faster by buyers leaping into getting the last tokens on board prior to the next hike in pricing. Recent whale allocations of $105K added even greater urgency, as large entries are depicted as long-term optimism and will occasion quicker involvement with shopping buyers. With over 18,300 holders, almost no tokens left in its Phase 6 allocation registered at under $0.04, Mutuum Finance has increased its MUTM price by 250%, raising $19.1 million. Having undergone a verified V1 launch, audited infrastructure, its mtToken yield, the buy and distribute dynamics, building a stablecoin, and L2 growth, several analysts believe that this new crypto can be among the most robust early-stage DeFi coins in 2026.

The post was accompanied by a short video clip showing the asset’s rapid shift from $2.01 to $2.17 within a brief period. The enthusiast described the movement as the early stage of a potential shift in momentum, focusing on the appearance of consecutive green candles and the visible increase in buying strength. This presentation was framed as an indication that XRP may be entering a more active phase after a period of relatively moderate trading. $XRP JUST WOKE UP AND CHOSE VIOLENCE Green candles popping… momentum building… This is how the MOVE begins. pic.twitter.com/TB6CrV6pWh — XRP Update (@XrpUdate) December 2, 2025 Market performance and current price data According to CoinMarketCap , XRP is trading at $2.15 at the time of the tweet, recording a 6.37% increase over the past 24 hours. The market behavior shown in the video aligns with this data, capturing a portion of the intraday appreciation. Traders monitoring short-term price action often look to such quick upward movements as possible early signals of improving sentiment or increased liquidity. The visible jump between $2.01 and $2.17 suggests intensified activity among buyers, which may have contributed to the reported daily gain. Factors supporting the recent upswing Several developments across the crypto market offer context for the momentum highlighted in the tweet. Institutional interest in XRP has increased, particularly through emerging exchange-traded products that have attracted noticeable inflows . This has contributed to higher liquidity and stronger demand, conditions that tend to support upward price movement. At the same time, network activity surrounding XRP has expanded, with greater traction in areas such as tokenization and ongoing enhancements to infrastructure tied to the asset. These developments have strengthened the narrative that XRP’s real-world utility is increasing. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Technical indicators also contribute to the current outlook. XRP has recently moved above key short-term resistance levels and regained momentum across multiple trading pairs. Market participants who rely on chart signals may interpret these developments as supportive of continued strength, particularly when combined with the volume increases seen during rapid intraday moves similar to the one shown in the video. A general improvement in market sentiment across the cryptocurrency sector has been further supported by encouraging traders to increase exposure to high-liquidity assets.

The company positioned the token as a mechanism to decentralize platform ownership and align incentives across device holders, developers, and network validators known as Guardians. The announcement comes amid a hardware security controversy, as Ledger researchers disclosed an unfixable vulnerability in the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 chip used in Seeker devices that could enable a complete device takeover and private key theft through physical access. Seek and you will find. SKR is coming in January 2026 pic.twitter.com/cwtlp8G8Zf — Seeker | Solana Mobile (@solanamobile) December 3, 2025 Token Distribution Targets Early Adopters SKR’s 10 billion token supply allocates 30% to airdrops targeting Seeker and original Saga phone holders, while 25% supports growth initiatives and partnerships with ecosystem participants. Another 10% funds are used for initial liquidity and launch operations, with an additional 10% reserved for community treasury governance. Solana Mobile receives 15% of the supply, and Solana Labs holds the remaining 10%. The token employs linear inflation, starting at 10% in year one and declining by 25% annually until stabilizing at a 2% terminal rate. Source: X/@solanamobile Solana Mobile said this structure incentivizes early participants who stake tokens to secure the network and support platform development during critical growth phases. Guardians, who are validators responsible for device authentication, dApp review, and community standards enforcement, will include Solana Mobile at launch, with committed partners Helius, DoubleZero, Triton, Jito, and Anza joining throughout 2026. Users can stake SKR to Guardians, back builders, secure devices, and curate the dApp Store, with ecosystem value flowing back to active participants. Security Flaw Shadows Launch Momentum Hours before the token announcement, Ledger disclosed a critical hardware vulnerability in the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 chip powering Seeker devices and other smartphones across multiple manufacturers. Security researchers Charles Christen and Léo Benito successfully executed electromagnetic fault injection attacks during the chip’s boot phase, gaining what they described as “ full and absolute control ” of compromised handsets. The attack bypasses memory protections and overwrites security controls embedded in the system-on-chip, enabling the extraction of cryptographic keys and sensitive data. Ledger found an unfixable flaw in the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 chip that can lead to full device takeover and private key theft. #Ledger #Solana https://t.co/F58gTKaxzi — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 4, 2025 While individual attack success rates range from 0.1% to 1%, Ledger estimates that repeated attempts can compromise a device within minutes for attackers with physical device access. Ledger disclosed the flaw to MediaTek in early May after beginning tests in February, prompting the chipmaker to notify affected device vendors. MediaTek responded that the Dimensity 7300 was designed for consumer smartphones rather than secure financial infrastructure, stating that manufacturers handling sensitive cryptographic material should implement specific physical attack protections. The company added that the vulnerability falls outside the chip’s original design scope, leaving affected devices permanently exposed since no software patch can resolve hardware-level flaws. Mixed Sentiment on Token Utility Social media commentary revealed divided perspectives on SKR’s value proposition and long-term viability. Critics questioned the token’s fundamental utility, noting the lack of clarity regarding revenue sharing or governance rights beyond platform coordination. One observer described the launch as “ backwards ,” arguing that without defined revenue entitlements, SKR functions essentially as a meme coin rather than a legitimate governance infrastructure. This is so backwards from how you should announce a token. There’s all this information about how this token will be used to pay for things, but nothing explaining why the token has any actual value (i.e. what revenue am I entitled to as a token holder?) Hot take: If you don’t… https://t.co/XCoYZ4twMG — Johnny The Hutt (@johnny_the_hutt) December 4, 2025 Others outlined airdrop farming strategies, recommending daily device usage, wallet swaps, validator staking, dApp interactions, and the deployment of the DePIN application to maximize allocation from the 30% airdrop pool. Tech creator Ashen noted the 10 billion supply represents unusually “ high inflation ” compared to standard 1 billion token launches. “ Solana REALLY loves inflation lmfaoo ,” he said. However, he expressed cautious optimism given the Solana team’s backing and the substantial 30% airdrop allocation for approximately 100,000 Seeker holders. Market observers also cited Solana’s broader ecosystem momentum, including recent partnerships like the KRW-pegged stablecoin collaboration with Korean infrastructure firm Wavebridge , and institutional validation evidenced by continued ETF inflows despite recent market volatility. Solana Foundation President Lily Liu recently emphasized at Binance Blockchain Week that stablecoin market capitalization has surged 50% this year, and positioned the blockchain as infrastructure for global improvements in capital efficiency.

BITW’s 250bps expense ratio is difficult to justify, given its 97% correlation with bitcoin and limited value from smaller altcoin holdings. Portfolio concentration is high: bitcoin comprises 74.7% and Ethereum 14.8%, with smaller coins contributing little to performance while adding substantial risk. Given underperformance, high fees, and excess risk, a bitcoin spot ETF like IBIT is preferable for most investors seeking crypto exposure. The Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ( OTC:BITW ) is a diversified cryptocurrency investment strategy designed to provide investors with exposure to the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. BITW can potentially be utilized by investors seeking a diversified portfolio of cryptocurrencies; however, the vast majority of assets are allocated to bitcoin, resulting in near-perfect correlation between BITW and bitcoin. Given the relative underperformance when compared to the historical performance of bitcoin and the challenging market dynamics in the cryptocurrency market, I am recommending BITW with a Sell rating. About Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund BITW was launched on November 22, 2017 as a Trust with Bitwise Investment Advisers as the Sponsor of the Trust. The Trust was later brought to the public markets on December 9, 2020 on the OTCQX Exchange. The Trust was converted to an exchange-traded product following SEC approval on November 18, 2025 and is now listed on the NYSE Arca Exchange. BITW was designed to track the Bitwise 10 Large Cap Crypto Index, which is administered by Bitwise Index Services. The Index was designed to track the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, which captures an estimated 75% of the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market. The Index is reconstituted monthly, and in turn, the ETF is rebalanced on a monthly basis. BITW has a net expense ratio of 250bps, a relatively high fee when compared to peer cryptocurrency portfolio strategies. Despite offering a diversified cryptocurrency portfolio, investors must weigh whether the differentiated returns over bitcoin provide enough value to justify the relatively high management fee. Seeking Alpha Looking through the portfolio, BITW is largely concentrated amongst the top holdings with bitcoin weighted at 74.7% and Ethereum at 14.8%. Given that portfolio weightings are dictated by market capitalization, smaller large-cap coins may be less represented in the portfolio, and thus, less influential to the value of the fund. Corporate Filings Looking at the performance of the portfolio, many of the smaller coins have significantly underperformed bitcoin in 2025 with bitcoin returning -6% year-to-date. In addition to this, BITW has substantially underperformed bitcoin across all historical holding periods, raising the question as to whether an investor needs to diversify across crypto assets or whether a simple investment in bitcoin will suffice. TradingView The cryptocurrency has experienced a cascading effect in recent months, potentially driven by the imbalance between fund inflows & outflows. This is a factor that may influence the price and flows of bitcoin, particularly as more retirement accounts include an allocation to bitcoin funds. Prior to the approval of bitcoin spot ETFs in January 2024 , bitcoin had a limited investor pool given the necessity for an additional brokerage account or limited options for investment vehicles. A major change that came with the emergence of bitcoin spot ETFs was the addition of advisory operations, which includes portfolio rebalances, cash raises, and charitable giving, amongst other features, adding risks that had previously not impacted bitcoin. I believe bitcoin may be exceptionally exposed given the liquidity and trading depth of the underlying asset, allowing for an appealing vehicle for capital raises. CoinGlass Another driving factor in the cryptocurrency market is the use of leveraged funds. Accordingly, over $1t in market capitalization has been wiped out since October 2025 with the price of bitcoin falling by nearly -35% from its high in October 2025 before recovering some ground. Much of the price decline was driven by investors unwinding leveraged bitcoin strategies, which are estimated to be in the range of $19-30b on October 10, 2025. TradingView Though I believe a small 1-2% allocation to cryptocurrency is appropriate for a diversified investment portfolio, investors must consider the amount of risk they are willing to take on by diversifying into smaller tokens held in BITW, such as Polkadot ( DOT-USD ) or Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ). Given the relative performance of the diversified portfolio when compared to bitcoin, investors must weight whether diversifying into riskier assets is appropriate. Overall, I believe investing in a bitcoin spot ETF like the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) will provide appropriate coverage in the cryptocurrency market, at least for the average investor. Given the additional risks, volatility, and relatively smaller positions of alternative coins, BITW may expose investors to more market risk than is necessary for cryptocurrency exposure. Risks Related to BITW BITW provides investors with a diversified portfolio strategy for investing in alternative coins, presenting certain risks that must be considered prior to making a final investment decision. Smaller cryptocurrencies may expose investors to significant volatility that may add unwanted risk to one’s portfolio. BITW is heavily concentrated in bitcoin and Ethereum and is heavily correlated with bitcoin at 97%, potentially exposing investors to greater risk and a higher management fee without a substantial amount of value being derived from the alternative coins held. Corporate Filings Final Thoughts BITW provides investors with diversified exposure across the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, differentiating exposure from bitcoin spot ETFs. Given the relative correlation of BITW to bitcoin, I do not believe that the ETF differentiates exposure enough to justify the high management fee, particularly given that the fund has underperformed bitcoin by a wide margin since inception. Given these factors, I am recommending BITW with a Sell rating.",BITW,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-04 11:40:02

According to Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan, the answer is surprisingly simple—nothing drastic. Contrary to alarmist predictions, Strategy, a significant holder, is unlikely to dump its BTC even if removed from the MSCI index. This clarification cuts through market noise and highlights the resilience of long-term institutional Bitcoin holdings. Why Are Bitcoin Holdings So Secure in This Scenario? Matt Hougan addressed specific market fears head-on. Some experts predicted a delisting would cause Strategy’s stock price to crash below its Net Asset Value (NAV), forcing a fire sale of its Bitcoin to cover obligations. However, Hougan provided a detailed breakdown showing why this is a myth. The company’s debt structure does not create immediate selling pressure. Its main obligations are manageable annual interest payments and a principal repayment due only at maturity. Therefore, there is no liquidity crisis that would mandate selling its core Bitcoin holdings. What Does This Mean for the Broader Bitcoin Market? This stance is crucial for market stability. Forced, large-scale liquidations of Bitcoin holdings can create severe downward price pressure and panic. Hougan’s explanation acts as a stabilizing signal. It demonstrates that sophisticated institutional players are not leveraged to the point where index changes trigger desperate sales. Their commitment to their Bitcoin holdings appears strategic and long-term, based on asset value rather than short-term index membership. This perspective should reassure investors concerned about artificial sell-offs. Let’s break down the key reasons Strategy can hold firm: No Margin Calls: The debt is not tied to the daily price of Bitcoin or the stock, so a price drop doesn’t trigger an automatic sale. Predictable Obligations: Annual interest payments are known and planned for, not a surprise demand for cash. Long-Term Maturity: The principal debt repayment is a future event, not a current liquidity need. Asset Focus: The fund’s value is derived from the underlying Bitcoin holdings, not its listing venue. How Should Investors Interpret This News? For the everyday crypto investor, this analysis offers a powerful lesson in due diligence. It’s easy to get swept up in dramatic headlines about index changes and potential collapses. However, understanding the fundamental financial mechanics behind major holders is key. This event separates price volatility narratives from solvency realities. A fund’s Bitcoin holdings are not automatically at risk just because its stock faces a challenge. The true test is its balance sheet and operational strategy, both of which Hougan indicates are sound. What’s the Final Verdict on These Bitcoin Holdings? In conclusion, the fear that Strategy would be a forced seller of Bitcoin appears significantly overblown. The clarity from Bitwise’s CIO helps demystify complex financial instruments for the crypto community. It underscores that serious institutional Bitcoin holdings are often backed by more robust financial planning than market rumors suggest. While index membership provides benefits like liquidity and visibility, it is not the sole pillar supporting these assets. The fundamental value and strategic role of Bitcoin in a portfolio can outweigh transient listing status. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is the MSCI index, and why does it matter? A: MSCI is a major global stock index provider. Being included in its indices often brings more investors and liquidity to a stock. Removal can reduce that attention but doesn’t directly affect the company’s assets. Q: Would a delisting actually cause Strategy’s stock price to fall? A: It might cause some short-term price pressure due to reduced visibility, but Hougan argues this doesn’t force a sale of the underlying Bitcoin assets that give the stock its value. Q: What are the real risks to Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings? A> The primary risks would be a catastrophic drop in Bitcoin’s price affecting the NAV, or an inability to meet its known debt obligations—neither of which Hougan links to a potential delisting. Q: Does this mean all crypto investment trusts are equally safe from forced selling? A> No. Each fund has a unique structure. Investors must examine debt levels, redemption rules, and custody arrangements. Strategy’s case, as explained, shows one robust model. Q: How does this news affect my personal Bitcoin investment? A> It reduces the perceived risk of a large, sudden sell-off from a major holder, which is positive for market stability. It emphasizes researching the major holders behind any asset.

At this point, while Donald Trump is expected to announce his FED presidential candidate at the beginning of 2026, markets are focused on the FED's December interest rate decision. As the Fed prepares to announce its December interest rate decision without significant data, a 25 basis point cut is being priced into the markets. According to CME FEDWatchToll data, the Fed is priced in at 87% for a 25 basis point rate cut in December, while leaving rates unchanged is priced in at just 13%. At this point, Delphi Digital predicted in its latest post that the Fed will make another 25 basis point cut in December, bringing the federal funds rate to around 3.50-3.75%. Analysts at Delphi Digital predict that the forward curve will see at least three more rate cuts in 2026, with interest rates falling below 3% by the end of the year. Analysts also stated that the end of the QT on December 1, the decline in the NPL and the full depletion of the RRP, constitute the first net positive liquidity environment since the beginning of 2022, thus changing the policy in 2026 from negative to positive. The Fed's interest rate path for next year is the clearest it has seen in years. Another 25 basis point cut is expected in December 2025, which would push the federal funds rate to around 3.5-3.75%. The forward curve projects at least three more rate cuts in 2026, which, if the path continues, would cause the interest rate to fall below 3% by the end of the year. But interest rate cuts are only part of the picture. The QT period ends on December 1st. The NPL will be reduced rather than replenished. The RRP has been fully depleted. All of this combined creates the first net positive liquidity environment since early 2022. *This is not investment advice.

He asserts that Bitcoin will reach $180,000 by the end of 2026. Garlinghouse said he feels more optimistic about the future of crypto than he has in recent years. He pointed to improving regulatory clarity in the United States as a major factor. Lily Liu stated that Bitcoin is okay even at a $90,000 threshold and said that prices are likely to go above $100,000. ‘The current moment represents a risk-off period after an excited risk-on phase’ – Garlinghouse The discussion highlighted that the crypto market entered October with a sharp pullback, more than $20 billion in leveraged Bitcoin positions wiped out, and funding rates turned negative across major derivatives platforms. The king coin is also 30% down from its record high and has dropped nearly 8% earlier in the week before recovering above $90,000. Data shows that traders are rotating into stablecoins rather than aggressively buying dips, which is an increasingly important market signal. According to him, the macro tailwinds into 2026 are the strongest he has seen in years. Garlinghouse also pointed to the regulatory clarity in the world’s largest economy. He highlighted that the US holds 22% of the world’s GDP. He also emphasized that the industry is shifting from speculation to real-world applications. He said new, easier-to-use applications are helping crypto solve practical problems rather than just serving as speculation vehicles. Additionally, Lily Liu described the recent pullback as a normal correction after a liquidity-driven rally. She said irrational moves upward typically lead to corrections. Binance CEO Richard Teng acknowledged the recent volatility but emphasized that the broader trend remains overwhelmingly positive. “Volatility isn’t unique to crypto—it’s across asset classes But institutions are coming in a big way. We’ve seen institutional onboarding double last year, and double again this year,” he said. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is steady with a minimal rise of 0.62%, now trading at $93,465. Ripple’s Garlinghouse predicts more ETF inflows in 2026 Garlinghouse pointed to the growing adoption of crypto ETFs. Currently, only 1% to 2% of the total ETF market consists of crypto products. Garlinghouse expects this percentage to grow over the next year. He said institutions are starting small but will gradually increase their involvement. “ I will bet anybody here that a year from now that will be more than 1 or 2%. There is going to continue to be inflows,” he added. He also stated that over $700 million has flowed into XRP ETFs within the past 2 to 3 weeks. According to him, “this is just pent-up demand from institutional investors from investors who want access because they don’t want to custody themselves.” XRP ETFs have amassed inflows of $874 million since XRPC’s inception. This made the spot XRP ETFs the best-performing funds from the entire crypto fleet. On the other hand, at the beginning of the week, Bitcoin ETFs gained $8.48 million. In contrast, the Ethereum funds experienced net outflows of more than $79 million, and the SOL-focused products were drained by $13.55 million in withdrawals. According to Lily Liu, “There is always a bright spot. Some ETFs are seeing inflows every single day. Not all parts of the market behave the same,” she stated.

This potential initiative signals a significant leap for digital asset adoption, directly integrating crypto into a critical sector of the Argentine economy. For a nation grappling with high inflation and currency volatility, this step could offer citizens a powerful new financial tool. What Does YPF’s Crypto Payment Plan Involve? According to reports from local media and blockchain news outlets, the plan is still under formal review. A specific launch date remains unconfirmed. However, the proposed system’s framework is becoming clear. It would reportedly use a “crypto-dollar” pricing standard. This means the price of fuel would be set in a dollar-pegged value, requiring a digital exchange to act as the crucial intermediary for the transaction. Potential crypto exchange partners named in the discussions include Lemon, Ripio, and the global giant Binance. Their role would be to facilitate the instant conversion of a customer’s cryptocurrency into the local currency needed to complete the fuel purchase, creating a seamless experience at the pump. Why is Argentina Pushing for Cryptocurrency Payments? Argentina’s economic landscape makes it a fertile ground for crypto innovation. The country has faced persistent challenges, including soaring inflation and strict capital controls that limit access to traditional US dollars. For many Argentines, cryptocurrencies have become more than an investment; they are a practical hedge and a means of preserving value. Integrating cryptocurrency payments into a essential service like refueling offers tangible benefits: Financial Inclusion: Provides an alternative payment rail for the tech-savvy and underbanked. Value Preservation: Allows citizens to spend digital assets pegged to stable value, bypassing rapid peso depreciation at the point of sale. Convenience and Innovation: Positions YPF as a forward-thinking brand, appealing to a growing crypto-user base. What Are the Hurdles for Widespread Crypto Adoption? While the vision is compelling, the path to implementation is not without obstacles. Regulatory clarity from the Argentine government will be paramount. Questions around consumer protection, tax treatment, and anti-money laundering compliance for such transactions need clear answers. Furthermore, the technical and logistical setup at thousands of gas stations represents a significant operational challenge. Ensuring transaction speed, security, and ease of use will be critical for customer adoption. The volatility of non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also poses a pricing challenge, which is why the proposed “crypto-dollar” model is a key part of the solution. Could This Spark a Latin American Crypto Revolution? YPF’s exploration is a landmark event. As a major state-owned enterprise, its adoption of cryptocurrency payments would send a powerful signal of legitimacy to the entire region. Other Latin American nations like El Salvador and Brazil have made strides in crypto integration. A successful rollout in Argentina, the region’s third-largest economy, could accelerate a domino effect, encouraging other essential service providers to explore similar options. This move goes beyond a simple payment upgrade. It represents a real-world test case for integrating decentralized digital assets into a country’s core economic infrastructure. The lessons learned here could provide a blueprint for other inflation-prone economies worldwide. Conclusion: A Fueling Station for Financial Innovation The potential for YPF to accept cryptocurrency payments is more than a corporate pilot program. It is a glimpse into a possible future where digital assets are woven into the fabric of daily life, offering resilience and choice in uncertain economic times. While hurdles remain, the very fact that this is under serious consideration marks a pivotal moment for crypto adoption in Argentina and beyond. The world will be watching to see if this spark at the gas station ignites a broader fire of financial innovation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Has YPF officially started accepting cryptocurrency? A: No, not yet. The plan is currently in the review and consideration stage. Local media reports indicate discussions are ongoing, but a firm launch date has not been announced. Q2: Which cryptocurrencies would be accepted? A: Specific currencies have not been confirmed. The reports suggest the system would be based on a “crypto-dollar” standard, which typically involves stablecoins pegged to the US Dollar (like USDT or USDC) or possibly Bitcoin, with instant conversion. Q3: Why would YPF consider this move? A> Primarily due to high demand in Argentina. With rampant inflation and currency controls, many citizens use crypto to preserve value. This offers them a practical way to spend those assets on essential goods, while positioning YPF as an innovative market leader. Q4: What are the main challenges? A: The key challenges include establishing a clear regulatory framework, ensuring seamless and secure technology at all stations, managing price volatility for non-stablecoin crypto, and educating consumers on how to use the new system. Q5: Could this happen in other countries? A: Absolutely. If successful, Argentina’s model could inspire similar initiatives in other nations facing economic instability or with high crypto adoption rates, particularly in Latin America and other emerging markets.

The regulator issued a Temporary Cease and Desist Order on December 1, 2025, alleging the Seattle-based firm illegally converted unredeemed customer funds into corporate revenue. The DFI’s investigation found that Coinme required customers to purchase paper vouchers at kiosks and redeem them online. When vouchers went unredeemed within a specific timeframe, Coinme allegedly claimed the outstanding balances as its own income, a violation of the state’s Uniform Money Services Act. “Washington’s money transmission laws exist to protect consumers that rely on licensed companies to safely transmit funds,” DFI Director Charlie Clark stated . Is Bitcoin ATM Operator Coinme About to Lose Its License? The order also charges that from 2020 to 2025, Coinme failed to maintain its legally required tangible net worth, submitted inaccurate reports, and did not properly disclose redemption timeframes to users. Coinme now faces a potential revocation of its state money transmitter license, a $300,000 fine, and a possible 10-year industry ban for the company and its CEO, Neil Bergquist. The company has 20 days to request a hearing before the order becomes permanent. In a statement , Coinme Chief Compliance Officer Ben Enea said the company is cooperating with regulators. The Institutional Take This action against Coinme is a significant escalation in the regulatory campaign targeting the operational grey areas of crypto-to-fiat gateways. For institutional desks, the key risk is not the solvency of one ATM operator but the precedent it sets for the treatment of customer funds held in limbo. Regulators are clearly signaling an end to the tolerance of treating unclaimed crypto assets as breakage or miscellaneous income. This move pressures all consumer-facing crypto services to tighten their accounting, escheatment, and disclosure policies, introducing new compliance overhead that could compress margins for the entire sector.

The cryptocurrency has fallen approximately 36% from its all-time high, creating anxiety among investors. However, a revealing CNBC report suggests this Bitcoin correction might be exactly what bullish investors should hope for. Historical data shows similar patterns have consistently preceded dramatic rallies. Why This Bitcoin Correction Feels Different (But Isn’t) Market corrections trigger emotional responses. When prices drop significantly, fear dominates decision-making. However, perspective is crucial. CNBC’s analysis highlights that during both the 2017 and 2021 bull markets, Bitcoin experienced multiple severe pullbacks. Some exceeded 30%, yet the asset ultimately recovered to set spectacular new records. This pattern suggests volatility isn’t a bug in the system—it’s a feature of Bitcoin’s growth trajectory. Think of these corrections as necessary consolidation phases. They shake out weak hands, reset overextended metrics, and build a stronger foundation for the next leg up. The current Bitcoin correction , while uncomfortable, fits neatly into this historical context. What Does History Tell Us About Post-Correction Rallies? Examining past cycles provides actionable insight. After significant corrections, Bitcoin didn’t just recover—it often entered accelerated growth phases. The key question isn’t whether a correction is happening, but what typically follows. 2017 Cycle: Multiple 30%+ corrections occurred before Bitcoin surged from around $1,000 to nearly $20,000. 2021 Cycle: Several major drawdowns, including a 53% drop in mid-2021, preceded the run to $69,000. Common Thread: Each major correction was followed by a period of accumulation, then a powerful breakout. This historical precedent doesn’t guarantee future results, but it provides a framework for understanding market behavior. The Bitcoin correction we’re witnessing may be setting the stage for the next chapter. How Should Investors Navigate This Volatility? Reacting emotionally to price swings often leads to poor outcomes. Instead, consider a strategy grounded in historical patterns and fundamental conviction. First, assess your risk tolerance. Corrections test investor psychology. If you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term thesis—its scarcity, growing adoption, and role as digital gold—short-term volatility becomes less concerning. Dollar-cost averaging during dips can be an effective way to build a position without trying to time the absolute bottom. Second, look beyond the price chart. Fundamental developments continue during corrections. Institutional adoption, network upgrades, and regulatory clarity often progress regardless of short-term price action. A Bitcoin correction can create a valuable buying opportunity for those focused on these long-term drivers. The Psychological Battle of Bitcoin Investing Market cycles are as much about psychology as economics. Corrections serve to reset excessive optimism and punish speculative excess. They separate long-term believers from short-term speculators. The fear you feel during a 36% drop is the same emotion that causes others to sell at a loss, transferring assets to stronger hands. Understanding this dynamic is empowering. It allows you to view the current Bitcoin correction not as a disaster, but as a predictable phase in a larger growth narrative. The CNBC report reinforces that this pain has, historically, been the precursor to tremendous gain. Conclusion: Correction or Opportunity? Bitcoin’s journey has never been a straight line upward. Its history is written in cycles of euphoric peaks and fearful valleys. The current 36% drawdown, while significant, aligns perfectly with patterns that have consistently led to new all-time highs. For disciplined investors, this Bitcoin correction may represent not a threat, but a historic opportunity disguised as risk. The data suggests that patience during these periods has been richly rewarded. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, understanding market history provides the context needed to make informed decisions amidst the noise. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How deep have past Bitcoin corrections been? Past corrections have varied. In the 2021 cycle alone, Bitcoin experienced a 53% correction in mid-2021 before rallying to new highs. The 2017 cycle saw multiple 30-40% pullbacks during its massive bull run. Does a correction always mean Bitcoin will reach new highs? While historical patterns are compelling, they don’t guarantee future outcomes. Each market cycle has unique drivers. However, the consistent pattern of post-correction rallies provides a strong historical precedent. How long do Bitcoin corrections typically last? Correction durations vary widely. Some last weeks, while others extend for months. The key factor isn’t the duration but whether the fundamental investment thesis remains intact. Should I buy during a Bitcoin correction? This depends on your investment strategy and risk tolerance. Dollar-cost averaging during dips has historically been effective for long-term investors, but you should never invest more than you can afford to lose. What fundamental factors should I watch during a correction? Monitor network activity (hash rate, active addresses), institutional adoption news, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic factors that influence all risk assets. How does this correction compare to previous ones? A 36% correction is significant but well within historical norms for Bitcoin. The asset has weathered much deeper drawdowns during previous bull markets and recovered strongly. Found this analysis of Bitcoin’s historic correction patterns helpful?

Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Ethereum (ETH) is up by 4.6%, now changing hands at $3,194. This is the highest increase among the ten. It’s followed by Binance Coin (BNB)’s 1.4% to $910. The smallest increase is 0.1% by Tron (TRX) , currently standing at $0.2803. At the same time, two coins have gone red since yesterday. XRP is down 0.7% to $2.17, while Dogecoin (DOGE) fell 0.1% to $0.15. In the top 100 coins, 75 appreciated over the past day. Bittensor (TAO) appreciated 8.3% to the price of $310. Zcash (ZEC) follows with an 8% decrease to $363. On the other hand, Provenance Blockchain (HASH) fell the most in the category: 10.8% to the price of $0.02193. Hedera (HBAR) is next, having dropped 3.4% to $0.1424. Meanwhile, Bitfinex argued that the market is showing “seller exhaustion” after a period of heavy deleveraging and panic-driven exits by short-term holders. “The combination of extreme deleveraging, capitulation among short-term holders, and early signs of seller exhaustion has created the conditions for a stabilisation phase and a relief bounce,” it said. This Bitcoin cycle is NOT like past cycles. I have been warning you all and explaining this for well over a year now. Hopefully, you were paying attention. — PlanC (@TheRealPlanC) December 4, 2025 ‘Staying In Structurally Volatile, Range-Bound Regime’ Bitunix analysts commented that the market is entering a composite phase of “macroeconomic turning-point expectations plus internal capital rotation within crypto.” This is against the backdrop of weakening employment and rising rate-cut expectations. Also, ETF flows and liquidation structures suggest a divergence in risk appetite, not a synchronized expansion. “In the short term, the market remains in a structurally volatile, range-bound regime,” the analysts say. “Going forward, close attention should be paid to whether rate expectations are revised further downward and whether capital continues to rotate from Bitcoin into higher-beta assets, as these factors will determine the risk level and trend slope of the next phase of the market.” Meanwhile, Alexis Sirkia, Chairman of Yellow Network , argues that “the market’s current late-cycle fragility is not a pricing problem, but an architectural one.” The trustlessness that drove initial innovation in Web3 is now lost amidst systems that burden themselves with on-chain settlement of every micro-transaction, the Chairman says. “This is why the entire asset class still remains tethered to the movements in Big Tech and equity markets.” Moreover, real decoupling of crypto from TradFi will be driven by increased operational efficiency and by ETF inflows, be it for BTC or the emerging XRP products. “We are witnessing the final phases of the Layer 1 and Layer 2 scaling debate,” Sirkia says. “The future requires a high-performance Layer 3, that operates off-chain, delivering the millions of transactions per second required for real-world utility.” Additionally, the next step for DeFi is a new utility layer, not a new asset class. “The projects and tokens that transition to high-throughput, low-friction architecture will revive the industry, and propel it to greater heights.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Thursday morning, BTC stood at $93,351. It was quite a choppy trading day for the coin, overall moving between $91,958 and $94,000. It has also increased by 2.3% over the past week, trading in the $84,553–$93,855 range. Moving above $96,000 would leave the door open for the price to surpass $100,000 and $112,000. On the other hand, a drop below $90,000 may lead to another drop to the $80,000 level. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Ethereum is currently changing hands at $3,194. Its trading day was notably steadier than BTC’s. It saw a relatively gradual increase from the intraday low of $3,039 to the intraday high of $3,231. Moreover, it increased by 5.6% in the 7-day period, trading between $2,736 and $3,222. If the bull keeps running, ETH could reclaim the $3,500 level. This would enable it to rise further towards $3,650 and $3,820. Ethereum (ETH) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Meanwhile, the crypto market sentiment saw another increase today within the fear territory. The crypto fear and greed index stands at 27 today , compared to 22 yesterday. As a reminder, the sentiment sat at just 16 two days ago, firmly within the extreme fear zone. We are seeing notable increases in optimism, but it doesn’t mean that the market participants are any less cautious or worried about short-term outcomes. They’re awaiting further economic data. ETFs Post Another Mixed Day On Wednesday, 3 December, the US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) broke the inflow streak, recording $14.9 million in outflows. With this, the total net inflow pulled back slightly to $57.76 billion. One of the 12 BTC ETFs recorded inflows, and three saw outflows. BlackRock took in $42.24 million. At the same time, Ark&21Shares recorded outflows of $37.09 million, while Grayscale let go of $19.7 million. On the other hand, the US ETH ETFs broke a brief streak of negative flows. On Wednesday, it saw $140.16 million in inflows. The total net inflow now stands at $13 billion. Of the nine funds, five recorded inflows, and none saw outflows. Of these, BlackRock took in the most, posting $53.01 million in inflows. Fidelity is next, with $28.11 million in positive flows. Meanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) blocked the launch of 3-5x leveraged crypto ETFs . These vehicles are designed to deliver three to five times the daily performance of stocks and cryptocurrencies. One of the key issues is a rule that limits how much leverage a fund can use. It caps a fund’s value-at-risk exposure at 200% of its reference benchmark. The SEC has stopped ProShares from launching new 3× leveraged crypto funds. They proposed 3× Bitcoin, 3× Ether, 3× Solana, 3× XRP. The SEC says the funds break leverage rules, so ProShares must fix the filings or withdraw them. Nothing moves forward until they do.… pic.twitter.com/SXlYAHKgkZ — 𝗕𝗮𝗻𝗸XRP (@BankXRP) December 3, 2025 Quick FAQ Why did crypto move with stocks today?

Altcoins stand to boom if the risk-on rotation comes to fruition in early 2026. Bitcoin Hyper brings SVM‑powered smart contracts and low‑latency execution to Bitcoin, targeting real DeFi and payments usage on BTC collateral. Maxi Doge channels 1000x trader culture into a meme token with future competitions, dynamic staking, and a treasury backing future partnerships. Is liquidity about to flip? Bitcoin dominance has started to leak lower , even as spot ETF flows stabilize and macro data quietly improves. With global PMI readings ticking back into expansion and traders increasingly pricing an eventual end to quantitative tightening, we’re seeing the first ingredients for a proper ‘risk‑on’ rotation in 2026. If that shift accelerates, capital typically moves in stages: Stage 1: Bitcoin – The cycle begins here. Capital flows into the market leader first as the safest entry point during a shift. Stage 2: Large Caps – Money rotates from $BTC into established, high-valuation cryptocurrencies (typically assets like Ethereum or Solana). Stage 3: High-Conviction Altcoins – Capital moves to mid-cap assets, but strictly those meeting specific quality criteria: Actual user bases. Clear, understandable narratives. Sufficient liquidity to support significant investment. Stage 4: Low-Float / Story-Driven Names – This is the speculative phase where prices go ‘vertical.’ However, there are some critical conditions for longevity here: Requirement: Must be backed by real infrastructure and legitimate community culture. Warning: Projects relying solely on ‘memes and promises’ without substance generally struggle to maintain their value. Then, to top it off, crypto analysts like Shanaka Perera on X say the altcoin resurrection is coming , and watching key information will be the biggest indicator as to when. That’s why the most interesting plays now are assets sitting at the intersection of structural demand and narrative readiness: Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , and Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) all do exactly that, making them the best altcoins to buy . 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): First Bitcoin Layer 2 With SVM Firepower Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) positions itself as the first-ever Bitcoin Layer 2 with Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, essentially grafting Solana‑style performance onto Bitcoin’s settlement layer. Instead of trying to redo Bitcoin, it uses a modular design: Bitcoin L1 for finality and a real‑time SVM L2 for high‑throughput execution anchored back to mainnet. On the technical side, $HYPER runs a low‑latency execution environment using the SVM, enabling sub‑second confirmation times and high TPS for smart contracts. A decentralized Canonical Bridge lets you move $BTC into wrapped representations on L2, where fees drop to cents, and complex transactions become economically viable. That unlocks a full DeFi and dApp stack denominated in $BTC: high‑speed payments, AMM swaps, lending markets, staking protocols, NFTs, and even gaming. It’s all built with familiar Rust tooling and SPL‑style tokens modified for this L2. For a full project breakdown, check out our ‘ What is Bitcoin Hyper ’ guide. For developers, it’s essentially Solana‑grade UX with Bitcoin security and demand as the underlying collateral base. Crucially, the market is already responding. The Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) presale has raised over $28.9M with tokens priced at $0.013375, signaling deep early liquidity and conviction at the infrastructure layer. With dynamic staking rewards currently at 40% you can make your money work for you without any extra effort. Smart money is also moving. Whale buys have hit highs of $500K , showing big money is getting in early. Join the $HYPER presale today. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): Meme Liquidity for 1000x Trader Culture Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is the pure sentiment play on speculative energy. Branded as a 240‑lb canine juggernaut embodying the 1000x leverage trading mentality, $MAXI wraps degen culture into a meme token built around competition, leaderboards, and shared upside through its community treasury. Instead of being ‘just a dog coin,’ Maxi Doge leans into a ‘Leverage King’ identity. Future holder‑only trading competitions, on‑chain leaderboards, and reward pools are designed to keep activity around the token, giving it a narrative hook during risk‑on rotations when gamblers return in force. The presale numbers already show meaningful traction: over $4.2M raised with tokens priced at $0.0002715, giving you clear exposure to a meme that actually has structural community mechanics. A dynamic staking APY currently at 72% adds another layer, encouraging you to lock tokens. In a 2026 altcoin season scenario where meme risk comes roaring back, tokens with defined culture, visible scoreboards, and funded treasuries tend to outperform anonymous copy‑paste projects. Maxi Doge is aiming squarely at that lane with its treasury‑backed ‘Maxi Fund’ for liquidity and partnerships. Learn how to buy Maxi Doge today. 3. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): NFT IP Turning Into Tokenized Infra Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) is a very different kind of altcoin candidate: a utility token sitting under one of the strongest NFT‑origin brands in crypto. $PENGU powers the Pudgy Penguins Web3 ecosystem, supporting gaming, staking, governance, and broader participation across a fast‑expanding IP universe that already spills into mainstream retail. The token runs on Solana with a max supply of 88.88B, tapping into low fees and high throughput while benefiting from major exchange liquidity and established infra. It’s closely tied to Pudgy’s push into gaming and digital experiences, where NFTs, merch, and token incentives can all reinforce each other in a flywheel. As the ecosystem grows through partnerships and IP expansion, including integrations with zk‑powered infrastructure like the Abstract network, $PENGU becomes a way to capture value from that brand growth rather than just speculate on individual NFTs. This aligns it with a broader shift toward ‘media‑fi,’ tokens under recognizable, memetic IP. July price action shows what happens when culture and capital collide: $PENGU rallied more than 60% after Coinbase adopted a Pudgy Penguin NFT as its profile picture, a small but visible vote of confidence from a major platform. If altcoin season becomes a bet on recognizable consumer brands, Pudgy Penguins could be near the front of the pack. Buy $PENGU from top exchanges like Binance. Recap: If 2026 delivers a real altcoin season on the back of easing macro and falling Bitcoin dominance, infrastructure‑grade bets like Bitcoin Hyper, cultural memes like Maxi Doge , and established IP tokens like Pudgy Penguins offer three distinct ways to position. Remember, this isn’t intended as financial advice, and you should always do your own research before investing.

Delivering frictionless institutional access across asset classes Spanning trading, custody, settlement, collateral management and tokenized assets, the partnership will unlock a new range of enhanced products and services that deliver frictionless access to both ecosystems, creating a holistic experience for institutional clients. Phase one: direct integration with 360T for superior FX liquidity In the first phase of the partnership, Kraken will integrate directly with 360T , a Deutsche Börse Group subsidiary and one of the world’s largest foreign-exchange trading venues. The integration gives Kraken clients access to competitive, bank-grade FX liquidity through one of the deepest global liquidity pools available, significantly improving fiat on- and off-ramp efficiency while ensuring institutional-grade execution and reliability. Expanding institutional crypto access through Kraken Embed The partnership will also leverage Kraken Embed to expand institutional crypto access across Deutsche Börse Group’s network. Together, the companies will develop advanced white-label solutions enabling banks, fintechs, and other financial institutions to offer secure, compliant crypto trading and custody services to clients across Europe and the U.S. Broadening derivatives access through Eurex Subject to regulatory approvals, the two companies plan to make Eurex -listed derivatives available to trade on Kraken, broadening access to Europe’s largest regulated futures and options marketplace. Enhancing trading and custody via Clearstream and Crypto Finance The collaboration will also allow Deutsche Börse Group clients to trade cryptocurrencies and derivatives via Crypto Finance , as well as through Kraken to service enhanced end-client models, while leveraging Clearstream and Crypto Finance, both Deutsche Börse Group subsidiaries, for custody. Advancing tokenization: integrating xStocks and 360X Kraken and Deutsche Börse Group will also work together to integrate xStocks within 360X ’s ecosystem, significantly expanding the reach of one of the most widely adopted tokenized equity standards globally. In addition, Deutsche Börse Group and Kraken will work to enable the distribution of securities held in custody at Clearstream in a tokenized form to Kraken’s client base. Kraken Co-CEO Arjun Sethi: “Our partnership with Deutsche Börse Group demonstrates what happens when two infrastructures designed for scale and trust intersect. By linking traditional and digital markets across a wide range of asset classes, we’re building a holistic foundation for the next generation of financial innovation: defined by efficiency, openness, and client access.” Deutsche Börse Group CEO Stephan Leithner : “This collaboration with Kraken is a great strategic fit for Deutsche Börse Group. It underscores our ongoing commitment to shaping the future of financial markets by combining the trust and resilience of our regulated infrastructure with the innovation of the digital asset ecosystem. Across our entire value this partnership will further enhance our support for institutional clients in the digital asset era and pave the way for digital capital markets.” A two-way gateway connecting U.S. and European institutional markets The partnership also establishes a framework for geographical access: Kraken will offer its U.S. capabilities to Deutsche Börse Group’s institutional clients seeking exposure to crypto and tokenized assets, while Deutsche Börse Group will provide its European infrastructure and services to Kraken’s global client base. This two-way integration underscores the shared vision to connect traditional and digital markets seamlessly.

Nexus Venture Partners just announced a $700 million fund with a surprising twist: only half will target AI startups, while the other half focuses on India’s rapidly expanding digital economy. This balanced approach challenges the industry’s single-minded AI focus and reveals a sophisticated strategy for long-term growth. Why Nexus Venture Partners is Rejecting the AI-Only Approach While global venture capital has poured unprecedented resources into artificial intelligence, Nexus Venture Partners is deliberately diversifying its eighth fund. The 20-year-old firm recognizes AI as a defining technological shift but argues that crowding into an overheated category carries significant risks. Instead, they’re maintaining their unique cross-border strategy that has served them since their 2006 founding. Jishnu Bhattacharjee, a managing partner at Nexus Venture Partners, explained the reasoning: “AI is a huge inflection point, and we are anchoring on that. But we are also seeing that many of these AI innovations are actually getting used to serve the masses better.” The $700M Fund Structure: AI Startups Meet India Opportunities The new fund represents a deliberate split in focus: Allocation Focus Areas Investment Stage 50% ($350M) AI startups, infrastructure, developer tools Inception to Series A 50% ($350M) India-focused startups in consumer, fintech, digital infrastructure Inception to Series A This balanced approach allows Nexus to capture AI’s transformative potential while maintaining exposure to India’s expanding digital economy, where AI adoption is rising but opportunities remain more diverse. India Startups: The Counterbalance to AI Concentration Risk Nexus’s India portfolio demonstrates why the country represents such a compelling opportunity: Consumer Sector: Investments include Zepto (quick commerce) and Rapido (bike taxi) Fintech: Portfolio companies like Turtlemint (insurance) Digital Infrastructure: Backing firms like Delhivery (logistics) and Infra.Market (construction materials) Logistics: Multiple investments in supply chain and delivery optimization Abhishek Sharma, another managing partner at Nexus Venture Partners, noted that the firm’s sweet spot remains inception to seed and Series A stages, often beginning with checks as small as a few hundred thousand dollars. Venture Capital Strategy: Why $700M is the Sweet Spot Nexus has maintained its $700 million fund size since launching Fund VII in 2023, despite opportunities to raise more capital. Bhattacharjee explained: “We don’t want to raise money for the sake of raising. We believe $700 million is the right amount for our early-stage strategy.” The firm’s disciplined approach has yielded impressive results: Manages $3.2 billion in capital across all funds Invested in more than 130 companies Recorded more than 30 exits including several IPOs Maintains an eight-member investment team for focused decision-making AI Startups in India: The Leapfrog Opportunity While India’s AI journey may not be as advanced as the U.S.’s in some areas, Nexus believes the country could leapfrog in specific parts of the AI ecosystem. Bhattacharjee highlighted several advantages: Large Talent Pool: India’s technical education system produces abundant AI and engineering talent Rising Digital Infrastructure: Improving connectivity and cloud access Localized Model Demand: Need for AI that supports India’s many languages and service requirements Faster Application Development: Startups building AI applications and agents rapidly atop open-source tools The partners pointed to portfolio companies like Zepto and Neysa as examples of AI taking shape in India. Zepto uses AI extensively across operations from customer support to routing, while infrastructure players like Neysa address India-specific needs including sovereign AI workloads and localized data handling. The Cross-Border Advantage: U.S. and India Integration Nexus’s unique structure as a single fund with an integrated U.S.-India team provides distinct advantages: U.S. Portfolio Examples India Portfolio Examples Cross-Border Benefits Postman (API platform) Zepto (quick commerce) Knowledge sharing between markets Apollo (GraphQL platform) Delhivery (logistics) Pattern recognition across ecosystems MinIO (object storage) Rapido (bike taxi) Best practice transfer Firecrawl (AI infrastructure) Infra.Market (construction) Diversified risk exposure FAQs: Understanding Nexus Venture Partners’ Strategy What is Nexus Venture Partners’ investment focus? Nexus Venture Partners focuses on early-stage investments in both AI startups and India-focused companies across consumer, fintech, and digital infrastructure sectors. How large is their new fund? The firm recently closed its eighth fund at $700 million, maintaining the same size as their previous fund. What stage companies do they invest in? Nexus typically invests from inception through Series A, with initial checks ranging from a few hundred thousand dollars to around $1 million. Which notable companies has Nexus Venture Partners backed? Their U.S. portfolio includes companies like Postman , while their India investments include Zepto and Delhivery . Who are the key partners at Nexus Venture Partners? Key partners include Jishnu Bhattacharjee and Abhishek Sharma , both managing partners based in the U.S. How does Nexus view India’s AI potential? They believe India could leapfrog in parts of the AI ecosystem due to its talent pool, improving digital infrastructure, and demand for localized solutions. Conclusion: A Balanced Vision for Venture Capital Nexus Venture Partners’ $700 million fund represents more than just another venture capital announcement—it signals a strategic shift toward balanced investing in an increasingly polarized market. By allocating equal resources to AI startups and India’s digital economy, the firm positions itself to capture growth across two of technology’s most promising frontiers while mitigating concentration risk. Their approach demonstrates that disciplined capital allocation, deep market knowledge, and cross-border integration can create advantages even in competitive investment landscapes. As AI continues to dominate venture conversations, Nexus’s balanced strategy offers a compelling alternative model for sustainable, diversified growth.

Despite recent pressure across the broader crypto landscape, XRP has repeatedly held this level. With bearish momentum fading and volatility compressing, it could be preparing for a potential reversal. Support Cluster Shows Strength As XRP Holds Its Ground XRP is reaching a point where it refuses to go any lower. Crypto analyst Henry has noted on X that the token is whispering loudly right now, showing strength exactly where it matters, and rising clearly from its trendline support after days of bleeding. Related Reading: XRP Shows Unusual Market Behavior as Traders Weigh Fresh Bullish Signals for December This level has been tested, rejected, and respected with precision, but this bounce feels different as the structure looks cleaner, the moment feels calmer, and the overall price action seems controlled. Whether it breaks out this time or not, the setup is undeniably shifting fast. Adding to the momentum narrative, Bloomberg reports that $11 trillion asset manager Vanguard will begin to allow clients to access their XRP ETFs starting from tomorrow. Meanwhile, the US spot crypto ETF flows on December 1st came in at a solid $90+ million. As a result of the setup, Henry has suggested that the next major target sits around $2.20 region if the market confirms the move. An inverted look at the XRP chart over the last six weeks reveals a textbook 3-drive pattern, a formation that has constantly preceded major reversal events in crypto. According to Dom, the translation into a higher low has finally formed, which hints at the first sign that a trend change could be developing. However, bulls need to regain the monthly RVWAP around the $2.22 region, and holding above this area would mark a significant shift in structure, opening the door for a continuation rally towards the $2.50 range. The order books are clear enough that, if momentum is going to flip, this is the time. If this price setup fails to hold this structure and slips back below $2.00, Don warns that the end of the year could turn less favorable. Why Exchange Balance Is The Ultimate Supply Metric The Co-founder of Tedlabsio, trader and investor Niels, pointed out that XRP has just flashed one of the strongest bullish signals seen in the current market cycle. Over the past two months, roughly 45% of the XRP supply held on exchanges has been withdrawn and moved off trading platforms.

When the supply available on the exchange reduces, the selling pressure reduces, and this is how big moves begin. Niels believes that XRP is entering that phase where most people haven’t noticed yet.

The young man was abducted, tortured and burned to death by other Ukrainians who managed to drain his crypto wallets, local police announced after investigating the case. Ukrainian student killed by crypto kidnappers in Austria A 21-year-old Ukrainian studying in Vienna has become the victim of a gruesome murder committed by compatriots who wanted his crypto assets. Danilo Kuzmin, believed to be the son of a politician from Eastern Ukraine, disappeared last week and was reported missing by his family. Ukrainian media identified the father as Sergey Kuzmin, deputy mayor of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city of 1.5 million residents. His son’s charred body was found in a car in the underground parking of a luxury hotel in the Donaustadt district of the capital city. Guests and residents called the police after seeing the burning vehicle, which had Ukrainian license plates, the Kronen Zeitung newspaper reported on Tuesday. Picture of the burning car. Source: Харьков News Following an investigation supported by Ukrainian authorities and Europol , the initial mystery has been largely unraveled, informed the leading Austrian daily. Two suspects, men aged 19 and 45 respectively, have been arrested. Both Ukrainian citizens, they were detained in their home country based on an issued international arrest warrant. More information about the ugly crime was released at a press conference. Colonel Gerhard Winkler, head of the Vienna State Criminal Police Office, ruled out a political motive. Law enforcement says the perpetrators did it for a lot of money. It established they had taken hold of a large sum of cryptocurrency but did not reveal the exact amount. Also quoted by the German crypto news outlet BTC Echo, Austrian officials explained the kidnappers gained access to two crypto wallets of the victim which have been completely emptied. A significant amount of cash, including U.S. currency, was found in one of the suspects upon arrest. Investigators believe the money came from the same criminal act. Austrian police share details about the horrific murder Officers working on the case provided a detailed account of Kuzmin’s last hours. The Ukrainian student was overpowered by the attackers in the Sofitel hotel and brutally beaten, as evidenced by footage from a surveillance camera. The young man was then placed in the back seat of a Mercedes Benz and set on fire in an apparent attempt to cover the signs of the violence. Forensic experts examining the body, which was discovered last Wednesday, found clear traces of blows and significant burns. Asphyxiation or heat shock were cited as the likely causes of death. Investigators detected the suspects on another video obtained from a gas station in Vienna. They fled to Ukraine shortly after committing the crime. The two men will be prosecuted in their country, and the Austrian judiciary will hand over the proceedings to the relevant authorities there, Colonel Winkler noted. According to a report by the OE24 news website, the 19-year-old was a fellow student who lured the victim. The torched expensive car belonged to Danilo, who was tortured until he revealed the passwords for his wallets. Another tragic crypto death in the region The young Ukrainian’s horrific murder in Austria is the latest in a string of crypto-related deaths across Eastern Europe and the wider region. In October, Russian crypto businessman and alleged scammer Roman Novak and his wife were kidnapped and killed in Dubai, as reported by Cryptopolitan. The news of his fate came amid surging kidnappings of crypto investors in Russia. Three suspects, all Russian citizens, were arrested in St. Petersburg as part of his case. Later that month, Ukrainian crypto investor Konstantin Galich, better known as the prominent influencer Kostya Kudo, was found dead , with a gunshot wound to the head, in a suspected suicide in his Lambo in Kyiv. In November, Russian crypto entrepreneur and alleged millionaire Alexei Dolgikh killed himself in a fiery crash with his own Lamborghini Urus speeding in Moscow.

55344615,639772,1764849643,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55344615.jpeg,"Bitcoin Is ‘An Asset Of Fear,’ Says BlackRock CEO Larry Fink",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-asset-of-fear-blackrock-ceo-larry-fink/,"BlackRock chairman and CEO Larry Fink has framed Bitcoin’s latest boom-and-bust swing as the clearest expression yet of its core narrative: not a growth asset, but “an asset of fear.” Speaking at the New York Times’ DealBook “Crypto and Capital” event alongside Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Fink contrasted the $13.5 trillion BlackRock manages with the motivations behind Bitcoin demand. BlackRock’s portfolios, he said, are essentially “managing hope” over decades: “The $13.5 trillion that BlackRock managed on behalf of our clients, it’s basically managing hope. That’s all it is. I mean, why would anybody invest in a 30-year outcome unless you’re hopeful that in 30 years you’re going to have the compounding effect.” Why Bitcoin Is ‘An Asset Of Fear’ Bitcoin, by contrast, he placed on the opposite side of the psychological ledger. “Bitcoin is an asset of fear,” Fink said. “You own Bitcoin because you’re frightened of your physical security. You own it because you’re frightened of your financial security. The long-term fundamental reason you own it [is] because of debasement of financial assets because of deficits.” His comments came against the backdrop of a sharp reversal in the Bitcoin market. The asset hit an all-time high above $125,000 in early October 2025 before sliding nearly 30% and briefly dropping below $90,000 in mid-November. Fink explicitly referenced that move to illustrate just how violent the swings can be. “If you had bought it at $125,000 and it’s now sitting at $90,000,” he said, anyone treating it as a trade is dealing with “a very volatile asset” and “you’re going to have to be really good at market timing, which most people aren’t.” For investors using Bitcoin as a macro hedge, he argued, the volatility looks different. “If you’re buying it as a hedge against all your hope, you know, then it has a meaningful impact on a portfolio.” In his telling, Bitcoin rallies when fear rises and retreats when fear subsides, citing episodes such as a US–China trade agreement or talk of a possible Ukraine settlement, after which Bitcoin “fell a little bit.” The pattern, he suggested, is consistent with a fear-driven hedge against geopolitical risk and fiscal slippage. Fink also underscored that structurally, the market remains fragile. “The other big problem of Bitcoin is it is still heavily influenced by leveraged players ,” he said, linking the asset’s outsized volatility to leverage even as flows through his firm’s spot ETF channel normalize. Since launching IBIT, BlackRock has already lived through several drawdowns on the order of 20–25%, he noted, yet the holder base is shifting. “We’re seeing more and more legitimate long-only investors investing in it,” he said, citing a large foundation endowment and adding that “a number of sovereign funds ” are “adding incrementally at $120k, at $100k,” and “bought more in the $80k’s.” For those allocators, he stressed, “this is not a trade. You own it over years. This is not a trade. You own it for a purpose.” The stance marks a striking reversal from Fink’s 2017 description of Bitcoin as an “index for money laundering… and thieves.” He told the audience that during the pandemic he “took it upon myself to visit and talk to a lot of people who were advocates of it,” asking, “What am I missing?” and that “around 2021–22” he began to “evolve those views.” It is, he conceded, “a very glaring public example of a big shift in my opinion,” adding, “I have very strong views but that doesn’t mean I’m not wrong.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $93,107.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|BlackRock|btc|BTC news|btc price|Larry Fink,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-04 12:00:43

With the $0.035 DeFi token moving through its final presale phase and the long-awaited V1 release approaching, many investors wonder whether this new crypto could deliver one of the next major breakouts of 2026. As anticipation builds, analysts are beginning to model scenarios where MUTM could rise several multiples after its first live version goes public. Yield Structure and Strong Presale Progress Mutuum Finance is building a decentralized lending system centered around two lending environments. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) structure allows users to supply assets into liquidity pools. In exchange, they receive mtTokens that increase in value as borrowers repay interest. These mtTokens create APY tied directly to real lending activity.For example, if a user supplies $1,000 worth of USDC, the mtTokens they receive will appreciate over time as demand for loans increases. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model provides borrowers with more flexibility. Users can choose variable rates that move with utilization or stable rates when predictable borrowing costs matter more. Loan-to-value limits help maintain safety. Lower-volatility assets often support LTV ratios near 75%, while more volatile assets remain closer to 35% to 40%. If collateral falls below required thresholds, automated liquidations are triggered. Liquidators purchase discounted collateral to repay debt, protecting the system from cascading losses. The presale began in early 2025 at $0.01. As interest increased across each stage, the token climbed to $0.035, marking a 250% growth before launch. Mutuum Finance has now raised more than $19M and grown to over 18,200 holders. Out of its 4B total supply, 1.82B tokens are allocated to the offering and more than 800M have been sold. Phase 6 is now nearing completion, with allocation levels rising daily as the V1 release approaches. V1 Launch Timeline and Security Review According to the official Mutuum Finance X account , V1 is scheduled to launch on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. This first release will introduce all core components of the lending protocol. The version will include the main liquidity pool, the mtToken system, the liquidation bot and the debt-tracking token. ETH and USDT will be supported from day one, giving users direct access to the platform’s primary lending and borrowing tools. For a new crypto entering the DeFi space, having these functions available at Testnet launch is a significant step, as it allows early users to explore how the DeFi crypto system behaves before the mainnet version goes live. Security continues to play a central role in Mutuum Finance’s development. The project has already completed a CertiK audit, achieving a 90/100 Token Scan score, which is above the average for most early-stage projects. In addition to this, the lending and borrowing contracts are undergoing a full review by Halborn Security , a firm widely recognized for auditing large-scale blockchain and top crypto protocols. Halborn is evaluating the contract structure, liquidation logic, mtToken behavior and oracle integrations to ensure all components function safely under different conditions. This multi-layered verification process is intended to reduce risks and prepare the system for user testing. With both CertiK and Halborn involved, expectations for a stable and smooth V1 rollout have increased. Investors following this next crypto project view the dual-audit approach as an important indicator that Mutuum Finance is progressing with long-term reliability in mind. Because of this level of development and early traction, many analysts believe MUTM could rise sharply once the $0.06 launch price goes live. Some projections indicate that the token could reach the $0.25 to $0.35 range in its first strong market period after V1. These forecasts are based on the demand structure seen during the presale and the real usage expected from the lending platform. Second Price Projection mtTokens play a central role in the yield mechanics of Mutuum Finance. Unlike many staking-based DeFi systems, where returns rely on inflation, mtTokens are tied to true lending activity. As borrower demand increases, mtTokens appreciate, and suppliers earn higher returns. Mutuum Finance also includes a buy-and-distribute mechanism. A portion of protocol revenue buys MUTM tokens on the open market. MUTM purchased on the open market is redistributed to users who stake mtTokens in the safety module. This creates long-term buy pressure and supports price sustainability in a way that meme tokens or low-utility coins cannot match. Accurate pricing is another essential part of the platform. Mutuum Finance is integrating Chainlink oracles along with fallback oracles and on-chain metrics. These help ensure fair liquidations, safe borrowing conditions and stable collateral management even during volatile swings. With these mechanics working together, several market analysts project that MUTM could reach the $0.35 to $0.50 range as long as adoption grows consistently through 2026 and the platform gains real usage. From its current $0.035 price, this would represent a potential 800% increase in a favorable market cycle. Why Analysts Compare MUTM to Early Solana Some analysts have begun comparing Mutuum Finance’s growth patterns to Solana’s early years. Solana gained traction because it introduced a high-utility system early, delivered strong development milestones and attracted interest just before its breakout period. Mutuum Finance is showing several indicators that resemble the early stages of successful projects. The team is preparing a working product before the token launches, supported by strong funding and fast community growth. The protocol offers dual-model utility rather than relying on a single-feature narrative, and it has already completed security audits by recognized firms. Demand has also remained consistent throughout the presale, adding to the project’s early momentum. Mutuum Finance aims to build a fully functional lending and liquidity ecosystem, not a temporary speculative token. This focus on utility is a major reason analysts believe MUTM may follow a similar early-stage trajectory to successful platforms like Solana — even though the market environment is different. With V1 approaching, growing presale activity and an expanding user community, the project is entering a critical period where momentum typically accelerates. Many early Solana investors entered at similar points in that project’s roadmap, which is why comparisons continue to surface across market commentary. Mutuum Finance is emerging as one of the strongest DeFi projects entering 2026. With dual lending markets, mtToken yield mechanics, a buy-and-distribute system, strong oracle design, a native stablecoin coming, layer-2 expansion plans, and audits from both CertiK and Halborn, the project is building a robust foundation. With the presale price still at $0.035 and V1 expected in Q4 2025, interest continues to rise. Analysts modeling future scenarios see potential movements toward the $0.35 to $0.50 range in a favorable market — representing a possible 800% increase from current levels. As Phase 6 nears completion and attention grows across DeFi communities, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as one of the top crypto breakout candidates for 2026.

Here’s What Is Coming,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-etf-is-locked-and-loaded-heres-what-is-coming/,"The crypto world often hides big shifts behind legal updates and filings. A simple SEC ruling could change capital flows, liquidity, and institutional interest almost overnight. That’s why the spot-XRP ETF feels like more than hype — it may rewrite how traditional finance touches XRP. John Squire raised that exact possibility in a recent X post. He argued that the only thing left now is for the SEC to declare the ETF “effective”. That final approval could unlock capital flows and unlock XRP’s next growth phase. What “Effectiveness” Really Means For an ETF to trade publicly in the U.S., every regulatory step must pass. The issuer must file with the SEC, meet exchange listing requirements, and trigger the effective-date process. For crypto ETFs, that pathway now often uses automatic effectiveness under Section 8(a) after removing the SEC’s “delay clause.” Until that final step completes, funds remain novelties — not investable assets. XRP ETF IS LOCKED AND LOADED They’re literally waiting for the SEC to declare it effective. Green light and this whole market flips. Utility, liquidity and real flows coming straight into #XRP . Buckle up. https://t.co/oyKivhL3Dr — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) December 3, 2025 Filings Are Already in Motion In late 2025, several firms filed amended registrations for spot-XRP ETFs. Canary Capital dropped the delaying clause and launched the XRP ETF on November 13. 21Shares, Bitwise , and Franklin Templeton also launched their ETFs. That activity places XRP in the same ETF pipeline that brought Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs into mainstream finance. The latest filings indicate institutional investors could soon be able to access XRP through regular brokerage accounts. Early Trading Signals and Market Reaction Canary’s spot‑XRP ETF, ticker XRPC, received regulatory clearance and is set to start trading on November 13, 2025. The ETF’s first trading day reportedly saw $58 million in volume — the highest single-day debut among 2025 ETFs. These early results hint at genuine demand. If XRP ETFs attract sustained institutional inflows, they could relieve pressure on exchanges, improve liquidity, and tighten price spreads. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What This Could Mean for XRP’s Future Spot‑XRP ETFs will let investors gain regulated exposure to XRP without holding or trading it directly on an exchange. That opens the door for pension funds, mutual funds, and large institutions that previously avoided crypto due to regulatory or custody concerns. Real institutional money could flow into XRP — not just speculative retail trading. That inflow may drive sustainable liquidity, broader adoption, and perhaps more stable valuations. But success depends on infrastructure readiness. Custody, auditing, and compliance must meet institutional standards. Early signs show ETFs, custodians, and exchanges have aligned to meet those requirements. What to Watch Next Investors should monitor SEC filings, exchange listing certificates, and custody disclosures. Watch for announcements from ETF issuers and authorized participant activity. Observe daily inflows, creation/redemption volumes, and on-chain XRP movement. If inflows remain strong and infrastructure holds, spot-XRP ETFs could shift capital flows from traditional banking rails into blockchain-based settlement. John Squire’s message may soon prove prophetic. The ETF is ready. The question is “when that green light hits, will the market flip?” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This is the first-ever exchange-traded product (ETP) designed to hold exclusively stETH, the token representing staked Ethereum via the Lido protocol. This stETH ETP represents a significant evolution in how traditional investors can access the Ethereum ecosystem. What Makes This stETH ETP So Revolutionary? Unlike other staking-related ETPs, WisdomTree’s new product is structured with a key difference: it operates without an unstaking buffer. Typically, providers hold a portion of assets in liquid ETH to manage redemptions, as unstaking Ethereum involves a waiting period. This new stETH ETP is a “fully staked” vehicle, meaning 100% of its underlying asset is stETH. This structure offers a purer, more direct exposure to the rewards of Ethereum staking. The product is now available for trading on major European exchanges, including: Deutsche Börse Xetra SIX Swiss Exchange Euronext Paris Euronext Amsterdam This wide availability signals strong institutional confidence and provides easy access for European investors. Why Should Investors Care About a Pure stETH ETP? For investors, this product simplifies a complex process. Instead of navigating decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols or managing private keys, they can buy a familiar security on a regulated exchange. The stETH ETP effectively bridges the gap between traditional finance and the innovative world of crypto staking. The benefits are clear: Simplified Access: Gain staking rewards without technical know-how. Regulated Environment: Trade within familiar, established exchanges. Pure Exposure: Direct link to stETH’s performance and yield. Liquidity: Easy to buy and sell like a traditional stock or ETF. What Are the Potential Challenges and Considerations? However, this innovative structure is not without its nuances. The absence of an unstaking buffer means the product’s net asset value is intrinsically tied to the market price of stETH. While stETH generally trades close to the value of ETH, it can occasionally experience slight discounts or premiums, especially during periods of high network activity or market stress. Furthermore, investors must understand they are exposed to the smart contract risks associated with the Lido protocol, albeit indirectly. While Lido is a leading and well-audited platform, it remains a crucial point of due diligence. This stETH ETP democratizes access but does not eliminate the underlying technological risks of the DeFi ecosystem. A Compelling Step Forward for Crypto Finance WisdomTree’s launch is more than just a new product; it’s a signal. It demonstrates growing institutional maturity around Ethereum staking and a demand for sophisticated, regulated wrappers for crypto-native assets. This stETH ETP could pave the way for similar products, further integrating staking yields into mainstream portfolios. In conclusion, WisdomTree has introduced a pioneering instrument that offers a seamless gateway to Ethereum staking rewards. By removing the unstaking buffer, it provides a uniquely pure investment thesis. For European investors seeking regulated exposure to crypto’s innovative income-generating mechanisms, this stETH ETP marks a compelling and revolutionary new option on the shelf. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an stETH ETP? An stETH ETP is an Exchange-Traded Product that holds staked Ethereum (stETH) as its primary asset. It allows investors to gain exposure to Ethereum staking rewards through a traditional securities exchange. How is WisdomTree’s stETH ETP different? It is the first ETP to hold only stETH with no unstaking buffer of liquid ETH, offering “pure” exposure to the staked asset and its yield. Where can I trade this stETH ETP? It is listed on Deutsche Börse Xetra, SIX Swiss Exchange, Euronext Paris, and Euronext Amsterdam. What are the main risks? Key risks include the market price variance between stETH and ETH, the smart contract risk of the underlying Lido protocol, and general cryptocurrency market volatility. Who is this product for? It is designed for European investors and institutions looking for a regulated, exchange-traded vehicle to access Ethereum staking yields without direct involvement in DeFi. Does it pay out staking rewards? The ETP’s structure is designed to reflect the value accrual of stETH, which includes staking rewards. The mechanism for distributing this value to shareholders (e.g., through price appreciation or dividends) depends on the specific product prospectus.

Speaking on CNBC’s Squawk Box on December 3, Scaramucci discussed the rise of Solana, how it fits within a diversified crypto portfolio and why major financial firms may eventually build on it. The SkyBridge Capital founder highlighted that Solana, along with Bitcoin and Avalanche, is emerging as a leader among public blockchains. He argued that the industry has reached a level of maturity in which three or four dominant players will become clear within the next five years. In his view, Solana is well placed to be one of those long-term winners. “I like the whole area because this is taking off, this is mature enough now that there will be 3 or 4 players that will emerge in the next 5 years and I think Solana will be one of those,” Scaramucci said. He added that “five years from now we will look back on Solana as a good entry point.” The American financier also pointed to tokenization as a major driver of future demand. He referenced asset-management giants such as BlackRock as potential users of fast, scalable blockchains like Solana for on-chain issuance and settlement of real world assets. “I am talking about broad scale delivery of tokenization, somebody like a BlackRock. Somebody thinking about tokenizing stocks and bonds or potentially real world assets, I think they will use something like Solana. It is bigger, it is faster, it has way more market share and it is growing faster than the others,” he told CNBC. At the time of writing, Solana continues to trade actively as institutional interest in tokenization increases across the crypto sector.

The move is pushing risk-on energy into meme and trading-community tokens as traders chase higher-beta plays. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) channels 1000x leverage culture into ERC-20 mechanics, mixing staking, contests, and community alpha to help retail stretch gains. Meme coins are shifting from passive jokes to game-style trading hubs where performance matters as much as the memes. XRP finally punched through a key resistance channel. Many traders had written it off as dead money, but the breakout woke everyone up again. With bulls now watching the $2.33-$2.40 zone, the mood has flipped from survival to ‘how can I squeeze more out of this move?’ At the same time, support around $2.204 is doing the heavy lifting. As long as that level holds, aggressive traders can lean into upside setups without taking full downside risk. If the level cracks, you can expect a full mood reset across the majors, not just XRP. Think of $2.204 as the floorboard you hope doesn’t start creaking. While XRP fans argue about Fibonacci lines and volume gaps, a different crowd is playing the higher-beta game. Capital is rotating into new crypto projects like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – a loud, gym-bro meme that worships 1000x leverage energy. Instead of quiet charts and patient TA, this camp wants weekly competitions, community alpha, and big bragging rights. For these traders, the idea is simple. If XRP grinds its way toward $2.40, meme and community tokens are where many will try to outperform. That is where projects like Maxi Doge step in. They try to act less like passive bets and more like social trading arenas built around conviction, risk, and leaderboard pressure. The kind of place where your PnL gets judged like a squat PR. XRP’s Breakout Fuels Risk-On Meme And Trading Narratives When a large-cap token breaks resistance, it usually flips the mood across the whole market. XRP did exactly that. Traders who have aged a few emotional years waiting for this breakout are now considering how to amplify returns if $2.33–$2.40 comes into play, while $2.204 continues to act as a safety net. Meme and trading-community tokens have become the natural extension of that mindset. You see it with tokens tied to trading culture and exchange mascots. They act like liquid side bets on market aggression. Some rely on pure memes. Others offer minimal utility, such as copy-trading, fee perks, or community tools. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) joins that pack. However, instead of being a passive mascot, it attempts to serve as a symbol of high-risk, high-conviction trading. It’s one of several tokens trying to turn degen culture, leaderboards and shared alpha into a full on-chain playground for people chasing more than slow XRP-style gains. Maxi Doge Turns Leverage Culture Into A Tokenized Arena Most meme tokens stop at funny branding, but Maxi Doge pushes far beyond that. It builds its entire identity around a 240 lb canine powerhouse that copies the mindset of traders who dream in 1000x leverage. The attitude is loud, playful, and clear: never skip leg day, never skip a pump. You can tell right away what kind of energy this token is trying to project. The core idea behind $MAXI is simple. It takes this ‘Leverage King Culture’ and turns it into real on-chain features that people can use. Instead of relying on random hype, the project tries to create a full trading arena where holders get access to private competitions and weekly leaderboards that show who managed to pull the highest ROI. The Maxi Fund treasury sits atop this system, supporting the project with liquidity and partnership deals, so the whole setup feels more like an ongoing challenge than a meme that hopes for a lucky pump. Rewards inside the ecosystem depend on performance, not surprise giveaways. That shifts trading from a one-time gamble into a recurring game. All of it runs on a clean ERC-20 framework on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network, with the smart contract handling supply, distribution, and staking in the background. The loud culture is on the outside, but the mechanics underneath stay simple and stable. The presale has already raised $4.2M, and right now you can buy $MAXI for just $0.0002715. Retail traders can join through dynamic APY staking, powered by a 5 percent allocation pool that pays out for up to one year. Join the $MAXI presale today.

The milestone positions XRP ETFs as the fastest-growing crypto ETF category in the market. XRP ETFs inflows, Source: SoSoValue The products pulled in $89.65 million on December 1st, followed by an additional $67.7 million the subsequent day. Major asset managers Invesco and Franklin Templeton have submitted applications to launch their own XRP-focused ETF products. Spot Solana ETFs now hold $651 million following recent capital inflows. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs maintain their dominant positions with $57.7 billion and $12.8 billion in assets, respectively. Staking Protocol Brings Yield to XRP Holders The Firelight Protocol has launched a staking-based insurance mechanism for XRP , addressing a long-standing gap in the asset's ecosystem. Sentora incubated the project with backing from Flare. XRP has historically lacked native staking or yield-generation options despite its position among the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Firelight enables token holders to stake their XRP to provide insurance coverage for decentralized finance protocols. The DeFi sector loses over $1 billion annually to hacks and exploits. Firelight's insurance model creates economic incentives for XRP holders while addressing security vulnerabilities across DeFi platforms. The protocol represents a significant development for Ripple's native token. Stakers can now earn returns by backing protocol security rather than leaving assets idle. SEC Halts Ultra-Leveraged Crypto ETF Applications The Securities and Exchange Commission issued nine warning letters to major ETF providers on December 2nd, blocking proposed ultra-leveraged cryptocurrency funds. Direxion, ProShares, and Tidal Financial received notices among other firms. The regulatory action targets products designed to deliver amplified exposure to volatile digital assets. Several applications sought approval for 5x leveraged funds tracking Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies. Rule 18f-4 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 restricts fund leverage based on value-at-risk calculations. The regulation caps exposure at 200% of a fund's reference benchmark. Proposed ultra-leveraged products would exceed these limits. The SEC maintains that extreme leverage poses unacceptable risks for retail investors. Even 3x leveraged products face stringent approval requirements in U.S. markets.

Several of the country’s commercial banks, led by the giant VTB, are preparing to offer direct crypto trading to clients. This follows a notable policy change by the central bank and could reshape how Russians interact with digital assets. Let’s break down what this means. What Does VTB’s Direct Crypto Trading Pilot Involve? VTB Bank, Russia’s second-largest financial institution, has announced it has completed technical and regulatory preparations. The bank is ready to launch a pilot program for direct crypto trading , initially targeting its high-net-worth clients. This is a substantial leap from the current restrictions, where banks are only permitted to offer crypto-based derivatives—complex financial instruments that mimic price movements without direct ownership. VTB aims to be the first Russian bank to provide this service, positioning itself at the forefront of the nation’s evolving digital finance sector. This pilot represents a crucial test case for integrating cryptocurrency services directly into a traditional banking framework. Why Is This Shift in Russian Crypto Policy Happening Now? The catalyst for this change is a revised stance from Russia’s Central Bank. For years, the institution maintained a cautious, often restrictive approach toward cryptocurrencies. However, the evolving global financial landscape and the need to regulate—rather than outright ban—digital assets have prompted a rethink. This policy pivot allows licensed financial entities to explore direct crypto trading within a controlled environment. The potential benefits for the Russian financial system are clear: Regulatory Oversight: Bringing crypto activity under the purview of major banks makes it easier for authorities to monitor and tax transactions. Investor Protection: Clients gain access through established, regulated institutions instead of unregulated offshore exchanges. Market Legitimization: It signals official recognition of cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class for sophisticated investors. What Are the Challenges and Implications of This Move? While promising, this development is not without its hurdles. Launching direct crypto trading within a traditional banking system involves navigating complex technical integration, stringent compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) laws, and ongoing regulatory scrutiny. Furthermore, the initial focus on high-net-worth individuals highlights a cautious, tiered approach. The bank is likely testing systems and demand with a smaller, more manageable client segment before considering a broader rollout. The success of VTB’s pilot will be closely watched by other Russian banks and could set a template for wider adoption. How Could Direct Crypto Trading Reshape Russia’s Financial Future? If successful, this pilot could be a watershed moment. It paves the way for a more integrated financial ecosystem where digital and traditional assets coexist within regulated entities. For Russian investors, it offers a new, potentially more secure avenue for portfolio diversification. Globally, it adds to the growing narrative of institutional cryptocurrency adoption, demonstrating how even nations with previously strict stances are adapting to the digital asset revolution. The move by VTB and its peers could encourage similar developments in other emerging markets. Conclusion: A Cautious Step into a New Financial Era VTB Bank’s readiness to pilot direct crypto trading is a definitive step toward mainstreaming digital assets in Russia. It reflects a pragmatic shift from outright resistance to controlled integration. While starting with a select clientele, this initiative has the potential to democratize access to cryptocurrencies under a regulated umbrella, blending innovation with oversight. The world will be watching to see if this Russian experiment becomes a blueprint for others. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is direct crypto trading? A: Direct crypto trading allows users to buy, sell, and hold actual cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum through a platform. This differs from trading derivatives, which are contracts based on an asset’s price without owning it. Q: Can anyone in Russia use VTB’s new service? A: Initially, no. The pilot program is specifically designed for VTB’s high-net-worth clients. A broader public rollout would depend on the pilot’s success and further regulatory approvals. Q: Why is Russia allowing this now? A: The Central Bank has shifted its policy to regulate the crypto market rather than ignore it. This brings activity into the formal economy, allowing for better oversight, taxation, and investor protection. Q: What does this mean for other Russian banks? A: VTB is aiming to be first, but other major banks have indicated similar plans. If VTB’s pilot is successful, it will likely trigger a wave of adoption across Russia’s banking sector. Q: Is this service available immediately? A: The bank has stated preparations are complete, but the pilot launch date has not been publicly specified. It is expected to commence in the near future. Q: How does this differ from using a regular crypto exchange? A> Using a bank for direct crypto trading offers integration with your existing financial accounts, potentially stronger regulatory compliance, and the security perception of a large, established institution compared to some independent exchanges.

Here Are the Details…,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/ethereum-founder-vitalik-buterin-offers-three-proposals-that-bring-radical-changes-to-eth-here-are-the-details/,"New statements about ETH came from Ethereum (ETH) founder Vitalik Buterin. Speaking from his account, Buterin offered new proposals for ETH and announced three structural updates that will shape the future direction of the network. He stated that these are deep structural changes that strengthen the network, simplify clients, and prevent all classes of DoS vectors. At this point, Buterin suggested three important updates to minimize Ethereum attack vectors. Buterin proposed three key changes: “Limiting the number of contract code bytes accessible per transaction, imposing a limit on ZK-EVM prover cycles (computational overhead), and strengthening the hard limit while overhauling the EVM memory cost structure.” Buterin explained that Ethereum has gradually evolved to limit the workload a single transaction or block can handle, and he expects this trend to accelerate. Buterin also added that these restrictions will reduce Ethereum's potential attack surface and make the network a simpler, more secure, and predictable system. “It's always nice to see people appreciate protocol changes that add hard invariants, which improve protocol security and future adaptability. All of this eliminates entire classes of DoS risks, simplifies client code, and creates more options for how to increase efficiency by imposing various kinds of hard limits on how much can happen within a single block or a single transaction. Here are the changes I think we'll want soon: * Limiting the number of code bytes accessed (short term: increased cost of calling large contracts, medium term: binary tree + per-piece pricing) * Limits on ZK-EVM prover cycles (repricing) * Changes to memory pricing to create a clearer hard limit on maximum EVM memory consumption. *This is not investment advice.

At a recent major industry event, a prominent CEO placed a bold bet on that exact scenario. Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse made headlines with a specific and optimistic Bitcoin price prediction , forecasting the flagship cryptocurrency will reach $180,000 by the end of 2026. This forecast isn’t just a random number; it’s grounded in a shifting market landscape that has many experts turning bullish. What’s Behind This Bold Bitcoin Price Prediction? Speaking at Binance Blockchain Week, Garlinghouse shared his reasoning with the audience. His confidence stems largely from evolving regulations in the United States. For years, regulatory uncertainty acted as a dark cloud over the crypto industry, deterring institutional investment. Garlinghouse argues this fog is finally lifting, providing the clarity large-scale investors need to enter the market with confidence. This regulatory progress, combined with the inherent scarcity of Bitcoin (capped at 21 million coins) and growing global adoption, creates a powerful recipe for price appreciation. When institutions like hedge funds, banks, and publicly traded companies allocate even a small percentage of their portfolios to Bitcoin, the demand can skyrocket. Key Factors Supporting a $180K Bitcoin Target Let’s break down the core elements that could propel Bitcoin toward this ambitious price target. Several converging trends provide a foundation for this Bitcoin price prediction . Institutional Adoption: The approval of Bitcoin ETFs has opened a massive, regulated gateway for traditional finance. This brings unprecedented levels of capital into the market. Regulatory Clarity: As Garlinghouse emphasized, clearer rules reduce risk for businesses and investors. A stable regulatory environment encourages innovation and investment. Macroeconomic Hedge: With concerns about inflation and currency devaluation, many view Bitcoin as “digital gold”—a scarce asset to preserve wealth. Halving Cycle Dynamics: The next Bitcoin “halving” is expected in 2024. Historically, this supply-cutting event has preceded significant bull markets. Is This Bitcoin Forecast Realistic? Examining the Challenges However, every Bitcoin price prediction must be weighed against real-world challenges. The path to $180,000 is not guaranteed. Market volatility remains extreme, and Bitcoin’s price can swing dramatically on news, macroeconomic shifts, or technological developments. Furthermore, while U.S. regulation is improving, the global landscape is a patchwork. Crackdowns in other major economies could create headwinds. Competition from other cryptocurrencies and potential technological issues also pose risks that investors must consider. Therefore, it’s crucial to view any long-term forecast as a well-informed projection, not a certainty. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors What does this mean for someone interested in cryptocurrency? First, use bold predictions as a starting point for your own research, not as financial advice. If Garlinghouse’s Bitcoin price prediction intrigues you, consider the following steps: Diversify: Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and consider a balanced portfolio beyond just Bitcoin. Focus on Fundamentals: Look beyond the price. Understand the technology, use cases, and long-term vision of any crypto asset. Adopt a Long-Term View: Crypto markets are cyclical. Prepare for volatility by focusing on a multi-year horizon, not daily price movements. Conclusion: A Vote of Confidence in Crypto’s Future Brad Garlinghouse’s $180,000 Bitcoin price prediction for 2026 is more than just a number. It is a powerful vote of confidence from a seasoned industry leader. It signals a belief that the foundational challenges of regulation are being solved, paving the way for the next wave of adoption. While the future is unwritten, this forecast highlights a growing consensus that Bitcoin’s journey is far from over, and its next chapter could be its most dramatic yet. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Who made the $180K Bitcoin prediction? The prediction was made by Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, during his speech at Binance Blockchain Week. What is the main reason for this optimistic forecast? Garlinghouse cited increasing regulatory clarity in the United States as the primary positive factor, as it reduces uncertainty for institutional investors. When does he predict Bitcoin will hit $180,000? The specific timeline given is “by the end of 2026.” Should I invest in Bitcoin based on this prediction? No single prediction should be the basis for an investment. Always conduct your own thorough research, understand the risks of cryptocurrency’s high volatility, and consider consulting a financial advisor. What is a Bitcoin halving, and why does it matter? A halving is a pre-programmed event that cuts the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks in half, reducing the new supply entering the market. It occurs roughly every four years and has historically been associated with bull markets. Are there risks to this prediction? Yes.

On-chain data showed the Trump family crypto fund sent 250M tokens to Jump Trading. World Liberty Fi moved $40M worth of tokens into the wallets of Jump Trading, one of the leading market makers in the crypto space. The tokens were moved directly to one of the trading wallets of Jump Trading , flagged for medium-level DEX activity. Within the first few hours, the WLFI within the wallets remained untouched. World Liberty Fi made its biggest WLFI transfer to a wallet identified as Jump Trading. The wallet is used directly for decentralized trading activity. | Source: Nansen In the past three months, Jump Trading received multiple transfers of WLFI, with the biggest so far for 45M tokens received on November 10. Jump Trading has also distributed WLFI to other wallets and counterparties. WLFI is currently sitting at a crossroads, mostly pressured by sellers. A breakout to a higher range may boost additional demand. Jump Trading, as a market maker, would be able to offer liquidity on the sell side in the case of a rally. Will World Liberty Fi support WLFI? Jump Crypto is not just a custodial holder, but an active trader through its Jump Trading branch. The market maker may be part of the plan to boost the position of WLFI. Recently, World Liberty Fi announced buybacks to boost the token, which is trading at a multi-month low. Jump Trading may use the holdings for many tasks, including liquidity provision, market-making operations, strategic partnerships, or OTC deals. So far, World Liberty Fi has not given any warnings about the token transfer or its intentions. WLFI tokens do not see any specific hype or attempts at deliberate pumps. Mindshare recently fell by 7% , while the price remained stagnant. WLFI traded at $0.15, close to the lower range for the past three months. The token’s open interest on derivative markets remained weak at $170M. The token traded with the lowest volumes for the past three months. World Liberty Fi focuses on USD1 adoption While WLFI tokens lagged, World Liberty Fi focused on the adoption of its USD1 stablecoin . The asset was added to Biannce spot as another option for BTC trading. The new BTC/USD1 trading pair will open alongside the new BTC/USD and DYM/USDC pairs. The new markets will also be open to bots and algorithmic trading. Additionally, USD1 will continue its zero-fee incentive period on Binance until December 31. USD1 supply remains at over 2.7B tokens, slightly down from the peak of 2.9B tokens as of October 30. Of that supply, 1.86B tokens are on BNB Chain, the main trading venue, where USD1 also trades against meme tokens. 651M USD1 is on Ethereum, and another 143.6M on Solana. The expansion of USD1 is also linked to future plans to add real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. As Cryptopolitan reported , World Liberty Fi is preparing to offer some forms of RWA from early 2026.

Discussions around adoption trends, regulatory progress, and overall market structure have intensified throughout the year, prompting many analysts to offer their own forward-looking assessments . With less than a month left in the year, we consulted Google’s Gemini AI for insight into XRP’s trajectory. The AI tool gave an insightful, data-driven prediction for XRP, setting multiple potential targets for December 31. Gemini’s Target for XRP When asked for a prediction, the model presented a structured forecast built on historical patterns, realistic adoption expectations, and current market behavior. The analysis emphasized that XRP’s price movement continues to be heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s performance , institutional adoption of Ripple’s payment products, and liquidity conditions across the broader crypto market. Based on this analysis, Gemini expects XRP to trade between $2.50 and $4 by the end of 2025. The digital asset is currently trading at $2.16. This target range shows a bullish outlook for the rest of the year, with the potential to hit a new all-time high. Gemini labeled this as the most likely scenario due to the asset’s historical tendency to rally later than Bitcoin. The model noted that XRP commonly follows Bitcoin’s post-halving peak with a delay and often produces moderate rather than extreme upside. It stated that XRP is likely to benefit from continued but steady expansion of institutional payment flows , rather than rapid or speculative surges. Other Potential Scenarios Gemini presented a bullish case. This depends on alignment across several external factors, including regulatory clarity and a strong altcoin market . In this scenario, the model suggested the upper range becomes achievable only if the U.S. regulatory environment turns decisively favorable, institutional settlement volumes expand, and retail participation returns at scale. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The target for this case is $5 to $8. Gemini explained that such levels would require “a full altcoin mania phase” supported by both macroeconomic stability and renewed speculative demand. While possible, this outcome relies on multiple drivers moving in the same direction. The AI model also presented a bearish case, centered on weaker global liquidity or a muted Bitcoin cycle. If Bitcoin fails to sustain momentum, altcoins could underperform, including XRP. Macroeconomic tightening or increased regulatory pressure would further restrict capital inflows. Even under those circumstances, the projection maintains XRP above the $1.2 level, reflecting the asset’s established role in the market.

This move by some of the world’s largest institutional investors represents a watershed moment for cryptocurrency adoption and suggests a fundamental change in how nations view digital assets. The news comes as Bitcoin experiences volatility after reaching new highs, creating what these sophisticated investors see as strategic buying opportunities. Why Are Sovereign Wealth Funds Buying Bitcoin Now? Larry Fink’s comments at the recent DealBook event provide crucial insight into institutional thinking. According to the BlackRock CEO, an unnamed sovereign wealth fund has been purchasing Bitcoin specifically during market dips, while multiple others are waiting on the sidelines to enter. This pattern reveals several important trends: Strategic accumulation rather than speculative trading Long-term positioning in digital assets Price sensitivity that creates buying opportunities during corrections Gradual entry to avoid market disruption The timing is particularly significant. Bitcoin recently corrected from its new high of approximately $126,000, creating what these institutional players view as an attractive entry point. This approach mirrors traditional investment strategies where large funds accumulate positions over time rather than making single, market-moving purchases. How Does BlackRock’s Involvement Accelerate Bitcoin Adoption? BlackRock’s role in this institutional shift cannot be overstated. As the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock serves as both a gateway and validator for traditional financial institutions entering the cryptocurrency space. The company’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has become a preferred vehicle for institutional exposure, with Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala already confirmed as an investor. This creates a powerful feedback loop: BlackRock’s credibility attracts sovereign wealth funds, whose participation then validates Bitcoin for other institutional investors. The result is accelerating adoption that could fundamentally reshape global reserve asset allocations. Consider these implications: Traditional reserve assets (like gold and bonds) facing new competition Increased liquidity and stability for Bitcoin markets Enhanced regulatory clarity as major nations participate Potential for Bitcoin to serve as a digital gold standard What Challenges Do Sovereign Wealth Funds Face with Bitcoin? Despite growing interest, sovereign wealth funds encounter significant hurdles when investing in Bitcoin. These challenges explain why many funds remain cautious and why those participating are doing so gradually: Regulatory uncertainty across different jurisdictions Custody and security concerns for large holdings Price volatility that conflicts with conservative investment mandates Political considerations and public perception challenges Liquidity constraints for massive position sizes However, these very challenges create opportunities for early adopters. Sovereign wealth funds that navigate these issues successfully may gain first-mover advantages in what could become a significant asset class. The gradual accumulation strategy mentioned by Fink suggests these funds are developing sophisticated approaches to manage these risks while building meaningful positions. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Future Price Action? The entry of sovereign wealth funds creates new dynamics for Bitcoin’s price discovery. Unlike retail investors who might panic during corrections, these institutional players view dips as buying opportunities. This could lead to: Stronger support levels during market corrections Reduced volatility as institutional holdings increase Longer-term price appreciation driven by structural demand Decreased correlation with traditional risk assets Moreover, the involvement of sovereign wealth funds suggests Bitcoin is transitioning from a speculative asset to a legitimate reserve alternative. As more nations allocate even small percentages of their wealth funds to Bitcoin, the resulting demand could be substantial given the cryptocurrency’s limited supply. Conclusion: A Transformative Moment for Global Finance Larry Fink’s revelation represents more than just another bullish signal for Bitcoin—it marks a fundamental shift in how the world’s most sophisticated investors view digital assets. Sovereign wealth funds, managing trillions in national wealth, are no longer merely observing cryptocurrency markets but actively participating. Their strategy of buying during dips demonstrates both conviction and sophistication, suggesting they view current prices as attractive for long-term accumulation. This institutional adoption creates a virtuous cycle: participation validates the asset class, which attracts more participants, leading to greater stability and acceptance. While challenges remain, particularly around regulation and custody, the direction is clear. Bitcoin is becoming institutionalized, and sovereign wealth funds are leading the charge. Frequently Asked Questions What is a sovereign wealth fund? A sovereign wealth fund is a state-owned investment fund that manages a nation’s surplus reserves. These funds typically invest in diverse assets globally to preserve and grow national wealth for future generations. Why would sovereign wealth funds invest in Bitcoin? Sovereign wealth funds might invest in Bitcoin for portfolio diversification, inflation hedging, exposure to technological innovation, and potential high returns. Bitcoin’s limited supply and decentralized nature offer characteristics different from traditional reserve assets. Which sovereign wealth fund is buying Bitcoin according to BlackRock? Larry Fink did not name the specific sovereign wealth fund purchasing Bitcoin during dips. However, he confirmed that Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala fund is an investor in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), indicating Middle Eastern sovereign wealth interest. How does BlackRock facilitate sovereign wealth fund Bitcoin investments? BlackRock provides institutional-grade access through its Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), which offers regulated, secure exposure without the complexities of direct cryptocurrency custody. This lowers barriers to entry for conservative institutional investors. Will more sovereign wealth funds buy Bitcoin? Fink indicated that multiple sovereign wealth funds are waiting to enter the Bitcoin market. As regulatory clarity improves and early adopters demonstrate successful strategies, more funds will likely follow. How does institutional buying affect Bitcoin’s price? Institutional buying typically creates stronger support levels during corrections, reduces overall volatility, and contributes to longer-term price appreciation through structural demand, especially given Bitcoin’s fixed supply.

According to CZ, the platform gives users a chance to earn yield on idle funds while placing bets. Users’ staked funds earn yield via DeFi integrations, differentiating it from idle-capital models like Polymarket . Predict.fun currently lists two markets with a combined volume of around $300,000. The site claims to have over 12,000 users with nearly 300,000 bets made. Predict.fun runs on a traditional order book model According to available data, Predict.fun is backed by CZ’s YZi Labs incubator and was founded by a former Binance researcher. The platform targets crypto, sports, and general events to position BNB Chain as a prediction hub. Instead of placing simple bets, users buy and sell event-based shares whose prices move depending on the crowd’s expectations. Welcome a new prediction market on @BNBChain .

The platform runs on a traditional order book model, giving users the option to execute instant trades or place limit orders at preferred prices. Predict.fun’s main selling point is its mobile-first approach. Before launching publicly, the team ran a “Skip the Queue” campaign that drew early interest by highlighting a streamlined smartphone interface. According to YZi Labs, Predict.fun fits into its goal of supporting tools that create genuine, everyday use cases on the BNB Chain. Through CZ’s endorsement, the announcement garnered over 590,000 views and sparked community buzz on yield mechanics and ecosystem growth potential. However, although BNB Chain has a potentially large user base, Predict.fun faces challenges related to limited stablecoin issuance and liquidity. This could hinder its growth. This launch follows CZ’s Trust Wallet’s new feature launch called “Predictions.” It allows users to trade on real-world events directly within the wallet, while maintaining full control of their funds. The feature starts with Myriad and will soon add platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket, giving users access to prediction markets across crypto, politics, sports, entertainment, and global events. As reported by Cryptopolitan, the market is expected to reach more than 220 million users globally, offering an in-wallet interface for trading tokenized outcomes. The US states go after the prediction markets To date, authorities in ten states and a string of tribal groups have launched or threatened legal action over the issue. This includes the Ohio Casino Control Commission, authorities in Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Arizona, Montana, Nevada, Massachusetts, and New York. Now, the state of Connecticut has fired a legal volley against sports events contracts with a trio of cease-and-desist orders sent on Wednesday to Robinhood, Kalshi, and Crypto.com. The state’s Department of Consumer Protection accused the companies of conducting unlicensed online gambling, more specifically sports wagering.

This decision instantly bridges the gap between millions of retail investors and the vibrant, yet often complex, world of DeFi on Coinbase’s Base network. For many, the news that Robinhood lists Aerodrome is a pivotal moment, simplifying access to a leading liquidity hub’s governance and utility token. Why Does Robinhood Listing Aerodrome Matter? Robinhood’s core mission is to democratize finance. By adding AERO, it directly tackles one of DeFi’s biggest hurdles: accessibility. Previously, acquiring AERO required navigating decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and managing self-custody wallets. Now, users of the intuitive Robinhood app can buy, sell, and hold AERO with the same ease as a stock. This significantly lowers the technical barrier to entry, potentially funneling substantial new capital and users into the Aerodrome ecosystem. Furthermore, a Robinhood listing acts as a powerful stamp of legitimacy. The platform conducts rigorous due diligence before adding any asset. Therefore, its decision to support AERO validates the project’s fundamentals, security, and compliance standing in the eyes of a cautious mainstream audience. What is Aerodrome (AERO) and How Does It Benefit? Aerodrome is the central liquidity protocol on the Base blockchain, designed to supercharge the network’s DeFi economy. Think of it as the primary trading and earning hub where users provide liquidity to token pairs and are rewarded. The AERO token sits at the heart of this system with two key functions: Governance: Holders can vote on crucial protocol decisions, steering its future development. Fee Sharing & Incentives: Users can lock their AERO tokens to earn a share of the protocol’s fees and boost their yield rewards. The announcement that Robinhood lists Aerodrome provides immense exposure. It introduces AERO to Robinhood’s vast user base, which may have been unaware of Base or DeFi opportunities. This can lead to increased demand, enhanced liquidity, and a more decentralized and robust governance structure as token ownership spreads. What Are the Potential Challenges to Consider? While the listing is overwhelmingly positive, it’s wise to consider the full picture. Increased accessibility can sometimes lead to higher volatility, as a new wave of less-experienced investors enters the market. Moreover, trading AERO on Robinhood is a custodial experience. This means you won’t directly interact with the Aerodrome protocol to vote or lock tokens for rewards from within the app—you simply hold the asset. Therefore, users seeking the full utility of AERO must still withdraw it to a self-custody wallet. This step preserves the true decentralized nature of participation. The key takeaway is that Robinhood lists Aerodrome as a tradeable asset, acting as a seamless on-ramp, while the deep DeFi functionality remains on-chain. What’s the Future for AERO After This Listing? This event is likely a major catalyst for Aerodrome. The influx of attention and capital can strengthen its position as Base’s liquidity backbone. We may see increased protocol revenue, more strategic partnerships, and accelerated development of new features. For the broader market, it sets a precedent. Successful integrations like this encourage other mainstream platforms to explore listing more DeFi-native tokens, further blurring the lines between traditional and decentralized finance. In conclusion, the decision for Robinhood to list Aerodrome is a strategic win for all parties. It empowers retail investors, bolsters a key DeFi protocol, and advances the industry’s journey toward seamless integration. It demonstrates that innovative crypto assets are steadily moving from the fringe to the forefront of accessible investment platforms. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Can I stake or earn yields with my AERO on Robinhood? A: No, not directly. Robinhood currently supports buying, selling, and holding AERO. To stake AERO or use it to boost yields on the Aerodrome protocol, you need to withdraw your tokens to a compatible self-custody wallet like MetaMask and connect to the Aerodrome website. Q: Does this mean AERO is now a security? A: Not necessarily. Robinhood’s listing does not change the legal classification of the AERO token. The platform likely conducted its own compliance review before offering the asset to its users. Q: What blockchain is AERO on? A: Aerodrome (AERO) is the native token of the Aerodrome Finance protocol, which operates on the Base blockchain. Base is a Layer 2 network secured by Ethereum. Q: Why would I buy AERO on Robinhood instead of a DEX? A: Robinhood offers simplicity, a familiar interface, and integration with your traditional investment portfolio. It’s ideal for those who want exposure to the asset without immediately engaging with DeFi mechanics. A DEX offers direct access to protocol utilities and typically lower fees. Q: Will this listing cause the AERO price to pump? A: While listings often generate positive sentiment and increased demand, which can impact price, cryptocurrency markets are volatile and influenced by many factors. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Did you find this breakdown of the Robinhood Aerodrome listing helpful?

The European Commission will investigate under traditional competition rules, rather than the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which targets the dominance of large digital platforms — particularly given that the Trump administration still views the DMA as a European effort to reduce US tech leverage. The probe i s ca rried out under traditional EU competition law, not the Digital Markets Act , indicating that Brussels views the core issue as potential abuse of market dominance. Italy started its probe into Meta months ago Italy had already begun its examination into Meta several months earlier. The tech giant was accused of abusing its dominant position by allegedly incorporating AI features into WhatsApp without securing user consent. Italian regulators say that by embedding Meta AI into WhatsApp, the company could steer users toward its own service and restrict competition from external AI chatbot providers. WhatsApp also issued modifications to its business solution terms in October, an update that Italy’s authorities argued could further limit market access for competitors. Meta has insiste d th e claims are “unfounded” and that the AI market remains open and competitive outside of WhatsApp. Their initial investigations began in July, following earlier indications that Meta may have violated competition rules with the integration of its AI assistant. WhatsApp’s huge European user base makes this a crucial investigation, as the outcome could set an important precedent for other leading platforms on how they integrate AI assistants into their systems while maintaining fair competition. Lately, the EU has been keeping a tighter eye on big tech companies in recent years to safeguard against potential market abuses, while US firms ramp up their digital presence in Europe. There are still DMA cases focused on Alphabet’s ranking of news outlets and the cloud computing practices of Amazon or Microsoft. President Trump has previously criticized EU tech policies Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, has urged the Trump administration to oppose EU digital rules . However, before this, President Trump had also condemned EU tech and competition policies, which he considers detrimental to the country, given the competitive costs of the rules they impose. In August, he warned of tariffs and export controls on cutting-edge technology and semiconductors in retaliation for digital taxes by other countries. After meeting Zuckerberg’s lobbying team, both Trump and Vice President Vance spoke out against EU regulations. Meanwhile, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick pressed Brussels last month to ease its digital oversight. Regulators have repeatedly stated they will impose a set of digital rules despite the Washington critique or threats of retaliation. However, the latest inquiry into Meta could drive more friction across the Atlantic, as US officials increasingly express disdain for EU regulation of major tech companies. The EU’s potential investigation suggests that Meta will face more regulatory burdens persistently internationally, particularly as artificial intelligence capabilities become increasingly integral to consumer services. Nonetheless, the firm has been dealing with antitrust cases domestically. However, in the last case brought by the US Federal Trade Commission, which could have compelled it to sell both Instagram and WhatsApp, it prevailed. The former FTC chair had accused Meta of employing “buy or bury” tactics to suppress new rivals, given its acquisitions of the two apps. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

Initial jobless claims just fell to the lowest since Sept. 2022. Not screaming distress. pic.twitter.com/guxioKpVLx — Lisa Abramowicz (@lisaabramowicz1) December 4, 2025 Bitcoin showed little reaction to the surprise data, holding steady around $92,000 as traders digest what the strength means for Fed policy. The 28,000-person beat signals the labor market isn’t in distress despite recent recession fears that drove crypto’s $1 trillion market cap loss in November, but the robust employment creates a critical dilemma, markets now face conflicting signals as December rate cut odds sit at 86%, yet strong jobless claims data typically reduces urgency for Fed easing at next week’s December 9-10 FOMC meeting . The question traders are asking: does Fed Chair Powell view this as confirmation that the economy can handle higher rates for longer, or simply proof that October’s rate cut worked without breaking the labor market? Initial claims at 191K represent a sharp drop from recent weeks and suggest hiring remains resilient despite government shutdown disruptions and slower payroll growth reported in September’s delayed jobs report. For crypto, stronger economic data reduces recession risk but also dims the rate cut expectations that fueled Bitcoin’s recovery from last Monday’s $88,500 low. The Fed ended quantitative tightening on December 1 and has signaled a dovish pivot, but hawkish policymakers could use today’s data to argue against December easing. Bitcoin needs to break and hold above $100,000 to confirm bullish momentum, with resistance at the descending trendline that’s capped rallies since November 11. The total crypto market cap sits at $3.2 trillion as the market weighs whether strong employment signals a bullish (no recession) or bearish (no rate cuts) outlook. With the Fed’s blackout period starting imminently before next week’s meeting, today’s jobless claims print is one of the final data points policymakers will consider, and it argues against aggressive easing. Support holds at $93,000, but if the Fed skips December’s cut, citing labor strength, Bitcoin could retest the $88,000-$90,000 zone that marked November’s capitulation low.

Speaking at Binance Blockchain Week 2025 in Dubai, Tom Lee once again raised his price expectations for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) amid the recent recovery. Stating that the crypto super cycle is still valid, Lee said that the period of the last decline and recovery was actually a period with more upside potential. At this point, he predicted $300,000 for Bitcoin and $62,000 for Ethereum. “The crypto supercycle is still valid. Bitcoin could reach $300,000 next year, while Ethereum could reach $62,000. Stating that Bitcoin has increased 112-fold and Ethereum almost 500-fold in the last 10 years, Lee pointed out that despite this growth, growth for Ethereum has actually just begun. “In the last 10 years, Bitcoin has increased 112-fold and Ethereum almost 500-fold, but this is not the end, it is the beginning. The next 10 years will be much bigger for ETH and the crypto market when Wall Street fully embraces tokenization.” Describing the recent price correction as an unexplained selling wave, Lee said that while the magnitude of the correction may seem like winter, the fundamentals suggest the opposite. Referring to the collapse that followed the FTX bankruptcy, the celebrity said, “When FTX crashed in the past, it took eight weeks for market makers to recover. Now is no different, the timing is similar.” Describing Ethereum as the “payment gateway of the future of finance,” Lee also argued that Ethereum is the only smart contract platform where tokenization will take off. “We had reduced our Ethereum purchases and are now aggressively increasing them again,” said Tom Lee, who recently noted that Ethereum is extremely undervalued. *This is not investment advice.

55349112,639844,1764856813,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55349112.jpeg,Ethereum Fusaka Is Live: Buterin Explains Why It Is ‘Significant’,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-fusaka-buterin-why-significant/,"Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade is now live on mainnet, marking a major structural change in how the network handles data and scaling. The upgrade was activated at epoch 411392 at 21:49:11 UTC, with the official Ethereum account first signalling “upgrade in progress . . . activating Fusaka @ epoch 411392 // 21:49:11 UTC” and then confirming that “Fusaka is live on Ethereum mainnet!” In its announcement , the account highlighted three core elements of Fusaka. PeerDAS “now unlocks 8x data throughput for rollups,” substantially expanding the amount of data that rollup-based layer 2 networks can publish to the network. The upgrade also introduces “UX improvements via the R1 curve & pre-confirmations,” and is described as explicit “prep for scaling the L1 with gas limit increase & more.” The project added that community members and core developers will “continue to monitor for issues over the next 24 hrs.” Why Fusaka Is ‘Significant’ For Ethereum Vitalik Buterin framed the core of the upgrade in unusually direct terms. “PeerDAS in Fusaka is significant because it literally is sharding,” he wrote. “Ethereum is coming to consensus on blocks without requiring any single node to see more than a tiny fraction of the data. And this is robust to 51% attacks – it’s client-side probabilistic verification, not validator voting.” In other words, the network can now agree on blocks even though no node has to download all of the associated data, relying instead on probabilistic verification on the client side. Buterin tied this to a long-running research line, noting that “sharding has been a dream for Ethereum since 2015, and data availability sampling since 2017,” and linking back to early research work on data availability and erasure coding. With Fusaka, that architecture is no longer just a roadmap concept but a live mechanism securing Ethereum’s data layer. At the same time, Buterin was clear that Fusaka does not complete the sharding roadmap. He stressed that “there are three ways that the sharding in Fusaka is incomplete.” First, he argued that “we can process O(c^2) transactions (where c is the per-node compute) on L2s, but not on the ethereum L1,” adding that “if we want to scaling to benefit the ethereum L1 as well, beyond what we can get by constant-factor upgrades like BAL and ePBS, we need mature ZK-EVMs.” Second, he pointed to the “proposer/builder bottleneck,” where “the builder needs to have the whole data and build the whole block,” and said “it would be amazing to have distributed block building.” Third, he noted bluntly: “We don’t have a sharded mempool. We still need that.” Despite those caveats, Buterin called Fusaka “a fundamental step forward in blockchain design.” He argued that “the next two years will give us time to refine the PeerDAS mechanism, carefully increase its scale while we continue to ensure its stability, use it to scale L2s, and then when ZK-EVMs are mature, turn it inwards to scale ethereum L1 gas as well.” He closed by sending “big congrats to the Ethereum researchers and core devs who worked hard for years to make this happen,” underscoring that for the Ethereum community, Fusaka is not a routine protocol update but the arrival of a long-promised sharding era on mainnet.

As per Mashreq Capital , BITMAC offers retail investors an innovative, diversified, and systematically rebalanced portfolio. This unique combination captures growth opportunities from both traditional and digital assets while reducing overall risk to levels comparable with a typical balanced portfolio. It is directed at retail investors, so the minimum investment amount is $100. It offers retail investors an institutional-grade path to gain exposure to digital assets while maintaining a balanced, professionally managed and risk-controlled allocation alongside traditional asset classes such as equities, fixed income and gold, in a one-stop retail fund solution. Mashreq Capital offers exposure to different asset classes BITMAC is offering both Bitcoin and gold. BITMAC will maintain a diversified allocation of 90% across global equities and global fixed income, 5% in gold, and 5% in Bitcoin. Philip Philippides, CEO at Mashreq Capital, noted, “Retail investors can find it challenging to balance their risk appetite and asset allocation choices within, as well as across, asset classes, a difficulty that becomes even more complex with the inclusion of the new digital assets that offer higher potential returns but at much higher risk. BITMAC is one of the first funds globally to include Bitcoin alongside traditional investments. It offers a one-stop solution within a simple, DFSA-regulated fund structure, professionally managed to systematically rebalance and control risk.” Earlier this year, DeFi Technologies announced that it had opened an office alongside its subsidiary Valour to offer digital asset ETPs across regulated exchanges in the GCC region. UAE sovereign wealth funds investing in Bitcoin ETFs Both the Abu Dhabi Investment Council (ADIC), owned by Mubadala, a sovereign wealth fund, and Mubadala itself have invested in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF. Both entities have purchased more than 16 million shares, according to regulatory filings. ADIC, which held 2.4 million shares back in September, increased its investment to almost 8 million shares at the end of September. At the time, the shares were worth about $518 million. Mubadala, the mother company, Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, disclosed a $408.5 million stake in iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) in a 13F filing released on May 15, 2025. The fund reported holding 8,726,972 shares as of March 31, 2025, an increase from 8,235,533 shares reported at the end of 2024. This increased exposure showcases the perception change regarding Bitcoin and crypto in general after President Trump took office. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is the world’s largest crypto ETF with more than $70 billion in assets. Get seen where it counts.

Some market watchers suggest that a short-term rally is likely, while others have highlighted potential signs of weakness. Related Reading: Zcash (ZEC) Leads Market Pullback With 24% Drop, Analysts Warn Of Another Crash Ahead Solana Eyes $144 Resistance Solana is attempting to turn the $140 area into support while nearing a key local resistance for the third time in a month. The cryptocurrency has been trading between the $120-$144 levels since mid-November, struggling to hold the high zone of its local range amid the recent market volatility. Last week, it bounced 10% toward the $140-$144 area but plunged to the range lows after Sunday’s correction, hitting a one-week low of $123 on Monday. As a result, it tested an ascending trendline that has served as support since 2023. Ali Martinez explained that during the pullbacks, SOL has retested this key support trendline. Notably, each time the cryptocurrency has tapped this trendline, it has registered strong rebounds in the following months, suggesting that the price could rally more than 80% in the mid-term if this support holds. Following Tuesday’s market rebound, SOL climbed back to the range’s highs, attempting to break above the local range once more. Market observer More Crypto Online affirmed that Wednesday’s rejection from $144 was expected, as it has been a strong resistance for weeks. The trader considers that investors should not worry as long as the mid-zone of its range, between the $134-$139 levels, holds as support. “It’s not really a breakdown yet; we just have a first sharp pullback,” he affirmed, emphasizing that there’s no evidence that bears are taking the lead. He noted that breaking below the mid-zone of its range would open the door to a retest of the recent lows and potentially risk a drop to the $117 area or lower. Nonetheless, if bulls take the lead and reclaim the $144 level as support, it will open the door to a retest of higher levels, including the $163 level, where the major next sell wall for SOL is situated. Is SOL’s Crucial Support Weakening? Meanwhile, Rekt Capital shared an analysis on longer timeframes, pointing out that Solana has been moving within a clear macro range, situated between the $123 and $296 levels, in the monthly timeframe, clustering in this area since early 2024. Per the analyst, the cluster has been developing for an extended period, and the potential for distribution and its function as a re-accumulation structure decreases the longer it continues. Despite this, he emphasized that the focus is on the 21-month horizontal support level. As the analysis noted, Solana recorded a 140% rally during the first major rebound from the region in Q3 and Q4, 2024. In the second rebound from this support, which started in Q3 2025, SOL saw a significantly smaller rally, surging around 100% to its September local high. Now, the cryptocurrency is rebounding from this level, which could confirm a decreasing trend for the altcoin and raise the alarm about its strength. “While it is positive to see this rebound, if the move turns into a weaker rebound than the previous ones, then questions will arise regarding the strength of this support,” Rekt Capital asserted. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Price In A ‘Vulnerable Technical Environment’ – Key Levels To Watch To prevent this, Solana must breach the one-year downtrend or the multi-week downtrend on the weekly timeframe. “Failing to break either of these trendlines would produce a smaller rally because the prior rebound — the one that rallied around 100% — would fall short and reject from these downtrends instead.” The analyst concluded that a sequence of progressively smaller bounces “would imply increasing weakness into that support, which in turn would favour the potential for distribution in Solana over time.” Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",Cryptocurrency Market News|crypto analyst|crypto market bull run 2025|crypto market correction|Crypto trader|Sol|SOL ATH|Solana|Solana breakout|Solana Price|Solana Rally|SOLUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-12-04 14:00:48

This upgrade extends Ika’s core promise: natively control accounts and assets across chains without bridges, wrapping, custodians, or trusted signers, now across a broader set of networks where EdDSA is the standard. “EdDSA support is a major expansion of what dWallets can control natively,” said Omer Sadika, Co-Founder of Ika. “It brings zero-trust, programmable signing to some of the most important ecosystems in crypto, so developers can orchestrate real cross-chain actions with real native assets, governed by Ika dWallet technology.” What This Upgrade Enables Until now, Ika’s dWallets provided zero-trust signing and programmable control for major ecosystems, including Bitcoin and EVM-compatible networks with ECDSA signatures. With EdDSA enabled at the dWallet signing layer, builders can now create applications that: Control Solana accounts natively, enabling cross-chain trading, vaults, payments, and automation without wrapped assets. Coordinate Zcash-native actions under programmable dWallet policies, unlocking zero-trust custody and interoperability for the most prominent privacy-preserving cryptocurrency. Manage Cardano, Stellar, Near accounts with smart contract-governed access control, enabling organizational treasury workflows and institutional-grade policy enforcement. In short: dWallets become natively multi-ecosystem signers, and enable a coordination layer for policy, composability, and execution logic. Native Cross-Chain Control Most cross-chain systems rely on bridges, message relays, wrappers, or trusted intermediaries. These approaches introduce risk (custody, exploits, governance capture) and limit composability. Ika’s model is different: no bridging of assets is required. Instead, Ika enables native signing via dWallets, where transaction authorization is always enforced under zero-trust assumptions. With EdDSA enabled, the same architecture now extends to chains where ECDSA is not supported and EdDSA has been adopted instead, dramatically expanding the surface area of what Ika dWallets can safely and directly orchestrate. How EdDSA Works in Ika’s Zero-Trust Model Ika’s security model is built on its 2PC-MPC cryptographic scheme. dWallet signing splits authorization into two independent components: User share: held and authorized locally by the user Network share: operated by Ika’s decentralized network of MPC nodes Both are required to produce a valid signature, and the full private key is never reconstructed. With this mainnet upgrade, that same model now supports EdDSA signing, bringing the benefits of Ika’s architecture (zero-trust, decentralization, scalability, sub-second performance, and programmable policy enforcement) to a wider set of chains. Why It Matters for Builders and the Ecosystem This upgrade expands the design space for applications that are only possible with Ika, including: Universal accounts across ecosystems One programmable signing primitive that can operate across EdDSA and non-EdDSA chains, operated with the same SDK and smart contract. Cross-chain DeFi with native assets Strategies can coordinate multiple ecosystems while keeping assets on their home chains. No wrapping, no “bridged liquidity.” Programmable custody and access control Rules are enforced at the signing layer: multi-party approvals, intent constraints, spending limits, automated risk controls, and organizational policy, secured cryptographically rather than contract-side permissions alone. Chain abstraction that’s actually zero-trust Users don’t “rent” their wallet to an app or provider. They co-authorize with the network under strict cryptographic guarantees. Availability The EdDSA-enabled signing upgrade is live on Ika mainnet, and supports dWallet-based signing for Solana, Zcash, Cardano, Stellar, Near, and additional EdDSA-compatible chains. Developers can begin integrating EdDSA-enabled dWallet workflows immediately through Ika’s developer resources . About Ika Ika is the fastest parallel MPC network, offering sub-second latency, unprecedented scale and decentralization, and zero-trust security. As the premier choice for interoperability, decentralized custody, and chain abstraction, Ika is set to revolutionize digital asset security and multi-chain DeFi.

Here’s What This Whale Just Did,https://timestabloid.com/massive-xrp-movement-spotted-heres-what-this-whale-just-did/,"A single blockchain transaction has drawn major attention in the crypto world. A 200 million XRP transfer — worth hundreds of millions — has moved between wallets. Observers are now carefully parsing what this means for liquidity and potential market shifts. Shortly after the transaction went live, crypto watcher Xaif flagged the activity, noting the transfer routed between wallets linked to Binance . The post emphasized the efficiency of the underlying ledger, pointing out that the entire transfer incurred a fee of only 0.00001 XRP. That tiny fee underscores how inexpensive massive transfers remain on the XRP Ledger. Verified Blockchain Data Blockchain data providers registered the 200 million XRP move. Based on prevailing exchange rates, the value at the time of the transaction was roughly US $435 million. That magnitude places it among the largest single transfers recorded recently for the asset. Despite the size, the negligible fee made it nearly costless relative to the value moved — a unique feature of XRP’s design. Transfers of this scale tend to draw immediate scrutiny: past large deposits to exchange wallets sometimes preceded sell-offs or triggered price dips. On other occasions, however, the moves turned out to be internal reallocation rather than external sell pressure. Massive XRP Movement Spotted A 200,000,000 XRP transfer (≈ $435M) just moved between Binance wallets This looks like a major liquidity shift happening behind the scenes. Ledger fee? 0.00001 XRP unmatched efficiency. Monitoring closely… pic.twitter.com/xOBOfjScvt — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) December 4, 2025 Why This Transfer Matters The broader context shows that the number of large XRP holders — wallets holding over 1 million XRP — recently surged to an all-time high, reflecting growing confidence among major investors. Some interpret this as a sign of long-term accumulation rather than speculative swing trading. At the same time, sizeable inflows to major exchanges such as Binance have, in prior instances, correlated with volatility and price dips. That history has heightened community alertness whenever big deposits show up on the ledger. With this transfer, the market faces a fork: is this liquidity consolidation or setup for distribution? The answer could steer short-term price behavior. Possible Explanations for the Move Given that both sender and recipient wallets are tied to Binance, one explanation is internal liquidity management. Exchanges often shuffle large balances between cold storage, hot wallets, and internal bookkeeping addresses. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another possibility is preparation for a large over-the-counter transaction or institutional sale. By consolidating funds, a whale could ready itself for a big sell-off without showing intent on public order books. Alternatively, the transfer might simply reflect routine exchange treasury operations — such as rebalancing reserves ahead of increased withdrawal volume or compliance obligations. What to Watch in the Coming Days To better interpret this move, follow any new transactions departing from the recipient addresses. Outbound transfers to unknown wallets or multiple smaller wallets may suggest distribution rather than accumulation. Also monitor order-book activity on major exchanges. Sudden large sell walls or spikes in sell orders could indicate that the deposit leads to selling pressure. Finally, community and institutional disclosures — if any — may offer clarity. While transparency is rare in whale operations, any official or leaked hint could pivot market expectations. Final Thought This 200 million XRP transfer adds a new chapter to the saga of large-scale coin movements. Whether it signals accumulation, redistribution, or simple internal housekeeping remains uncertain. The next few days of blockchain data and market activity should reveal the true motive.

Digital Asset, the firm building the privacy-focused Canton Network , has raised $50 million in a funding round packed with financial titans. This move isn’t just about capital; it’s a resounding endorsement from the very institutions that shape global markets. Why Is the Canton Network Funding Such a Big Deal? Forget the typical venture capital frenzy. This funding round reads like a who’s who of traditional finance. Participants included banking giant BNY Mellon, investment platform iCapital, exchange operator Nasdaq, and data powerhouse S&P Global. Their collective participation is a thunderous vote of confidence. It shows that major players now see a specific, urgent need for blockchain technology designed from the ground up for their world—a world of strict rules and private dealings. Yuval Rooz, CEO of Digital Asset, put it clearly. He stated that institutions across the financial ecosystem recognize the need for blockchain infrastructure built for regulated markets. The investment from firms like Nasdaq and S&P Global, he added, represents a major milestone. This isn’t experimentation; it’s strategic adoption. What Makes the Canton Network Different? Most public blockchains, like Ethereum, are designed for transparency and open participation. However, this creates a challenge for banks and asset managers who must protect client data and comply with regulations. The Canton Network tackles this head-on as a “privacy-focused Layer-1 blockchain.” Think of it as a dedicated financial highway with controlled on and off-ramps. Privacy by Design: Transactions and data can be shared only between permissioned participants, keeping sensitive deal terms confidential. Built for Regulation: Its architecture allows institutions to meet know-your-customer (KYC) and other compliance requirements seamlessly. Interoperability: It aims to connect disparate systems across the financial sector, allowing assets and data to move securely between applications. Therefore, this $50 million injection will likely accelerate the development of this niche but critical infrastructure, bringing real-world assets like stocks and bonds onto blockchain rails in a compliant way. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto? This funding round is a landmark moment that points to two parallel futures for blockchain. On one track, you have the vibrant, public world of DeFi and retail crypto. On this new, powerful track, you have the quiet, institutional revolution led by networks like Canton. The involvement of Nasdaq and S&P Global is particularly revealing. These are market infrastructure providers, not speculative investors. Their goal is efficiency, settlement finality, and creating new data products. By backing the Canton Network , they are actively shaping the blockchain stack that will underpin future markets. This could lead to: Faster and cheaper settlement for traditional assets. New forms of collateral and lending in wholesale finance. Greater transparency for regulators without exposing private transaction details. Conclusion: A Quiet Revolution Gains Momentum The $50 million raised by Digital Asset is more than just a number. It is a definitive signal that institutional blockchain adoption is moving from pilot projects to production-grade infrastructure. The Canton Network , with its focus on privacy and regulation, is now uniquely positioned with the capital and credibility to become the backbone for a new era of finance. While retail attention swings with market prices, this development proves the foundational work for a blockchain-powered financial system is being built, funded, and endorsed by its most established players. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Canton Network? The Canton Network is a privacy-focused, permissioned blockchain platform designed specifically for institutional financial markets. It enables secure and compliant transactions between regulated entities. Who invested in Digital Asset’s latest round? The $50 million funding round included major institutions like BNY Mellon, iCapital, Nasdaq, and S&P Global. Why is this funding significant for crypto? It signifies deep institutional belief in blockchain’s utility for traditional finance. Backing from market infrastructure giants like Nasdaq suggests a move towards real-world implementation, not just speculation. How is Canton different from Ethereum or Bitcoin? Unlike public blockchains, Canton is permissioned and privacy-centric. It is built for regulated institutions that need to control participant access and keep transaction details confidential among chosen parties. What will the $50 million be used for? While not explicitly detailed, the capital will likely fund further development of the Canton Network protocol, expand its ecosystem of applications, and support commercialization efforts targeting global financial institutions. Does this mean traditional finance is fully adopting crypto? It shows selective, strategic adoption of the underlying blockchain technology for specific use cases like settlement and asset tokenization, rather than an embrace of all aspects of the public crypto ecosystem.

According to Bloomberg Law, Florida’s Third District Court of Appeal ruled Wednesday that the lower court erred when it concluded it lacked personal jurisdiction over Binance Holdings Inc. According to Bloomberg Law, Florida’s Third District Court of Appeal ruled Wednesday that a user who alleges roughly $80 million in BTC was stolen on Binance may revive a state-level lawsuit, finding the trial court erred in concluding it lacked personal jurisdiction over… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 4, 2025 The decision allows the plaintiff to proceed with a state-level lawsuit alleging that Binance failed to act quickly after the theft was reported. Appeals Court Reverses Dismissal Saying Use of AWS Ties Binance to Florida The case stems from a 2022 incident in which the plaintiff, identified as Michael Osterer, reported that about 1,000 Bitcoin was stolen from his wallet. He claims the hackers transferred the funds to a Binance account, where the assets were converted and withdrawn before the exchange intervened. Osterer alleges that Binance was negligent, breached its contractual duties, and enabled the laundering of stolen property by failing to freeze the assets promptly. Osterer is seeking the full value of the stolen Bitcoin, estimated at roughly $80 million, along with interest. In 2023, he also attempted to expand the case into a class action on behalf of other victims whose stolen assets were allegedly routed through Binance. A trial court initially dismissed the lawsuit after determining that Binance , which operates offshore, did not have sufficient connections to Florida to be sued in the state. The appeals court overturned that finding, ruling that Binance’s U.S.-facing affiliates and its reliance on U.S. infrastructure were enough to establish jurisdiction. The court specifically pointed to the exchange’s use of Amazon Web Services and its U.S. operational footprint as valid contacts with Florida. The decision sends the case back to trial court, where Osterer will again be allowed to argue his claims under Florida state law. The ruling adds to legal pressure on offshore crypto exchanges that have previously relied on jurisdictional defenses to block U.S. lawsuits involving stolen assets. Binance may still seek to appeal the ruling or attempt to shift the dispute into arbitration, a strategy the company has pursued in other U.S. cases. Even After Zhao’s Pardon, Binance Faces Fresh Legal Heat in the U.S. The revived lawsuit comes as Binance continues to face sustained legal scrutiny in the United States. In November, the exchange and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, were named in a federal lawsuit filed by the families of victims of the October 2023 Hamas attack. Families of the Hamas 2023 attack victims have sued Binance and CZ for facilitating $1 billion in crypto to the accounts of terror groups. #HamasCryptoFunding #Binance #ChangpengZhao https://t.co/lLG1d5D75l — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 25, 2025 The plaintiffs accused Binance of knowingly facilitating crypto transactions tied to the militant group and helping move more than $1 billion through accounts linked to terrorist organizations. Binance has denied the allegations and said it complies with international sanctions laws. Earlier this year, Binance also sought to dismiss a separate class action brought by U.S. investors in California, arguing that an arbitration clause in its user agreement required private dispute resolution. That case is tied to broader securities law claims alleging the exchange promoted unregistered crypto tokens and misled investors. Binance is trying to dismiss a U.S. class action lawsuit, saying users agreed to arbitration—not court. #Binance #Securities #CryptoLawsuit https://t.co/c8VGpdC7CI — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 20, 2025 Binance’s legal disputes in the United States have already led to some of the largest settlements in crypto history. In November 2023, the exchange agreed to pay $4.3 billion to resolve charges brought by the DOJ over violations of the Bank Secrecy Act. Also, CZ pleaded guilty to a related criminal offense and accepted a separate $150 million personal settlement. Binance also paid $2.7 billion to settle a civil case with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In May 2025, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission dropped its civil enforcement lawsuit against Binance and Zhao, bringing an end to a legal battle that had lasted more than two years. Months later, in October, President Donald Trump issued a pardon to Zhao , wiping away the criminal conviction tied to the Justice Department case.

Key Takeaways: Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas says the Chainlink ETF opened with $41M in inflows and $13M in volume. The debut beat Solana’s launch, but trailed XRP’s $243M Day-1 inflow reported by SosoValue. ETF analyst James Seyffart cautioned it wasn’t a blockbuster. Despite a pullback across major tokens in recent weeks, the new fund attracted sizable capital on its first trading day. Chainlink ETF Debut Draws $41M, Signaling Demand for Regulated Altcoins According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas , the product ended its debut session with $41 million in net inflows and about $13 million in trading volume. The figures placed Chainlink among the stronger ETF launches this year and suggested that, at least for some investors, regulated vehicles remain the preferred route into higher-risk digital assets. The showing stands well above the opening day for the Solana ETF, which recorded just $8.2 million in volume based on data from Farside Investors. Still, the XRP ETF remains the category’s heavyweight, registering $243 million in first-day inflows, according to SosoValue. Even so, analysts urged restraint. James Seyffart said the launch was not a “blockbuster,” though he noted that the fund quickly reached about $64 million in assets under management, including an $18 million seed allocation. “Chainlink shows that less liquid products can still attract attention in an ETF wrapper,” he wrote, pointing to the role exchange-traded funds can play in widening market access. So, $GLNK took in ~$42 million on day 1. Not ""blockbuster"" success but very good for a new launch. Volume was strong. The fund currently sits at $64 million in assets. Chainlink showing that longer tail assets can find success in the ETF wrapper too. https://t.co/CgVCxlykGr — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) December 3, 2025 For Chainlink itself, the debut offered little immediate relief. The LINK token is up nearly 10% over the past week but remains down more than 39% over the past year, according to price data cited by Cointelegraph. Chainlink’s appeal lies in its infrastructure role. The network supplies on-chain applications with external data, enabling price feeds, cross-chain transfers and tokenized assets to function reliably. As demand for decentralized finance and real-world asset tokenization grows, investors appear willing to give even second-tier tokens a closer look. New Altcoin ETFs Steal Spotlight as Bitcoin Funds Struggle The new Chainlink ETF comes amid the rollout of a wave of new altcoin ETFs. Over the past month, issuers have launched products tied to Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin, with more XRP and Dogecoin funds set to list next week. The Canary Capital XRP ETF (XRPC) debuted with $58 million in net inflows, the highest opening-day haul for any ETF this year, edging out the Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL), which launched with $57 million. BSOL has quickly become one of the early success stories of 2025, accumulating over $660 million in assets within three weeks and avoiding a single day of outflows. As reported, the New York Stock Exchange has approved the listing of Grayscale’s XRP and Dogecoin exchange-traded funds, clearing both products to begin trading on Monday. NYSE Arca, the exchange’s ETF-focused subsidiary, filed certifications on Friday confirming the listing and registration of the Grayscale XRP Trust ETF Shares and the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust ETF Shares under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Bitwise Asset Management has also unveiled the Bitwise Dogecoin ETF as investor appetite for altcoin exposure continues to increase.

Solmate and RockawayX have combined forces, creating a $2 billion powerhouse. Market watchers are buzzing with speculation. Could Solana's native coin, SOL, be on the verge of a significant price surge? Discover the details and the coins poised for growth in this new era. Solana Shows Potential for Growth Despite Recent Dips Source: tradingview Solana's price is hovering between $126 and $143, showing a slight positive movement over the past week. Despite some drops in the last month, Solana is holding above its support levels, suggesting room for growth. If it breaks through the $151 mark, it could target the next resistance around $168. That would mean a climb of over one-sixth of its current upper range. Solana's recent performance hints at recovery potential, with its RSI standing in a neutral zone. With the current support and resistance levels, Solana might push higher, but it remains crucial to keep an eye on market trends. Conclusion The merger between Solmate and RockawayX positions Solana as a leading player with a valuation of $2 billion. This consolidation could impact SOL's market position positively. With robust backing and increased resources, SOL might be poised for significant growth. Market observers will be keen to see if SOL can reach or surpass the $150 mark. The future looks promising for SOL, given the momentum from this merger. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World, BTC is currently trading at $91,966.76 on the Binance USDT market. This move has sent ripples through the investor community, prompting questions about the sustainability of the recent rally and the health of the broader market. Let’s break down what’s happening and why it matters for your portfolio. Why Did the Bitcoin Price Drop Below $92,000? Market corrections are a normal part of any financial asset’s lifecycle, and Bitcoin is no exception. The recent dip in the Bitcoin price can be attributed to a confluence of factors. First, after a strong upward trend, profit-taking by short-term traders is almost inevitable. Secondly, broader macroeconomic concerns, such as shifting interest rate expectations, often trigger volatility across risk assets, including crypto. Finally, the market is digesting a mix of on-chain data and trader sentiment that suggests a period of consolidation was due. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Investors? For long-term holders, often called ‘HODLers,’ a single price drop is typically viewed as noise within a larger trend. However, for active traders, this volatility presents both risk and opportunity. The key is to understand the context of the move. Is this a healthy pullback within a bull market, or the start of a deeper correction? Analyzing trading volume and key support levels around $90,000 and $88,000 will be crucial in the coming days. Here are three immediate actions to consider: Review Your Risk Management: Ensure your stop-loss orders are updated and your portfolio allocation still aligns with your risk tolerance. Look for Accumulation Zones: If you believe in the long-term thesis, a lower Bitcoin price can be an opportunity to dollar-cost average into a position. Monitor Market Sentiment: Keep an eye on fear and greed indices and social media chatter, but avoid making emotional decisions based on short-term panic. How Should You Navigate This Market Volatility? Navigating a falling Bitcoin price requires a cool head and a clear strategy. Remember, volatility is the price of admission for the potential returns in the cryptocurrency space. Instead of reacting to every tick, focus on the fundamental drivers of Bitcoin’s value: its fixed supply, growing institutional adoption, and its role as a digital store of value. Technical analysis can help identify potential entry and exit points, but it should not override a sound, long-term investment plan. In conclusion, while the break below $92,000 for the Bitcoin price is noteworthy, it is not catastrophic. It serves as a stark reminder of the asset’s inherent volatility. Successful investing in this space hinges on education, disciplined strategy, and a focus on long-term horizons rather than daily price fluctuations. The market is breathing, and this movement is part of its natural rhythm. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is the Bitcoin bull market over because of this drop? A: Not necessarily. Bull markets are characterized by strong upward trends interspersed with corrections. A single drop below a support level does not define a market cycle. The overall trend and fundamental drivers need to be assessed. Q2: Should I sell my Bitcoin now? A: This depends entirely on your investment goals and strategy. Panic selling during a dip is rarely advisable. Consult your pre-defined investment plan and risk management rules before making any decision. Q3: Where is the next major support level for Bitcoin? A: While markets are unpredictable, traders often watch previous resistance-turned-support zones. Key areas to monitor following the drop below $92,000 could be around $90,000 and $88,000, based on recent price action. Q4: What usually happens after a sharp Bitcoin price drop? A: The market can either continue downward, consolidate (trade sideways), or bounce back. The subsequent price action depends on buying pressure, broader market sentiment, and any new catalysts or news. Q5: How can I stay updated on real-time Bitcoin price movements? A: Use reputable cryptocurrency tracking websites and apps that provide real-time data from major exchanges. Setting up price alerts for key levels can also help you stay informed without constantly watching the charts. Q6: Does this drop affect other cryptocurrencies? A: Typically, yes. Bitcoin often sets the tone for the broader crypto market. When BTC experiences significant volatility, altcoins (alternative cryptocurrencies) frequently follow suit, often with greater magnitude.

They told the US Treasury they fear he would slash interest rates fast to please Donald Trump if he becomes Federal Reserve chair. The concern is simple. They think policy would shift toward politics, and that scares the debt market. These warnings came from private talks in November. The Treasury held one-on-one meetings with leaders from major Wall Street banks, large asset managers, and other big players in the US debt market. The talks happened before Bessent started his second round of interviews to replace Jay Powell, whose term ends in May 2026. Multiple people familiar with the talks confirmed the timeline. Treasury sounds out Wall Street on Hassett The Treasury confirmed it meets often with market players. It said it “regularly engages with a variety of market participants and investors on important developments and dynamics in the Treasury market and broader financial markets.” It also said that during those talks, market expectations across different asset classes for the five final Fed chair candidates were “extremely narrow.” Hassett, the White House’s top economic official , has moved into the front of the race in recent weeks. Trump and Bessent reduced the original list from 11 candidates down to a short group. On Tuesday, Trump said he plans to name his pick “early” next year. He also said Hassett is a “potential” choice. Right after that comment, the US dollar slipped for a short time. The White House allegedly responded through the Financial Times, saying the president will nominate the most qualified people and that talk about possible picks before an official announcement is “pointless speculation.” The Treasury added that it is “confident that [Trump’s] selection will serve the American people well.” Inside the market, the mood is not calm. Some senior bond investors said they would rather see other names. They pointed to Rick Rieder of BlackRock and Christopher Waller from the Fed. They see both as more distant from Trump than Hassett. Several people involved in the November discussions said the fear comes from Hassett’s close link to Trump. The president has pushed hard for sharp rate cuts. He also called Powell a “stubborn mule” for only lowering borrowing costs slightly this year. Bankers and investors told the Treasury they worry Hassett could push for broad rate cuts even if inflation stays above the Fed’s 2% goal. One market participant used a blunt warning. “No one wants to get Truss-ed,” the person said. The comment referred to the UK bond market collapse in 2022 after former prime minister Liz Truss rolled out tax cuts without funding. The risk grows if US inflation moves higher next year. The Fed’s favored inflation gauge stood at 2.7% in August. Big bond managers worry that a dovish Fed chair, combined with rising prices, could trigger a sharp sell-off in long-term Treasuries. One market player said loose policy plus high inflation is the exact mix that can break the long end of the bond market. Fed board doubts and Hassett’s long résumé Some investors also doubt Hassett’s ability to manage the Fed itself. They told the Treasury they are not sure he could unite a divided Fed board or lock down agreement on rate policy. Among the people in those Treasury talks were members of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, or TBAC. This group is made up of major Wall Street bond leaders. It advises Bessent on debt sales and market structure. Two people linked to the matter confirmed their involvement. When Hassett met with TBAC earlier this year, the discussion stayed far from bond math. People familiar with the meeting said he spent little time on markets. He focused instead on White House priorities. That included talk about Mexican drug cartels. Robert Tetlow, a senior policy adviser who recently left the Fed, shared his view. He said Hassett came across as “smart, eloquent and self-assured.” Still, investors remain uneasy. They point to Trump’s constant attacks on the central bank over the past year. They fear that Hassett’s closeness to the president could weaken the Fed’s independence. Claudia Sahm, now chief economist at New Century Advisors and a former Fed economist, put it this way: “Kevin Hassett is more than capable of doing the job of Fed chair, it’s just a question of who shows up. Is it the Kevin Hassett who is the active participant in the Trump administration? Or Kevin Hassett the independent economist?” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",Economy|Federal Reserve|USD,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-04 15:15:31

According to a report by Wu Blockchain, Zhao has denied any cooperative relationship with the family of former U.S. President Donald Trump. Furthermore, he has quashed speculation about a dramatic return, stating he has no plans to rejoin the daily management of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. This news sends a clear signal about the priorities and path of one of crypto’s most influential figures. What Did Changpeng Zhao Actually Say? The statements from Changpeng Zhao are notably direct. He addressed two of the biggest questions surrounding his post-settlement life head-on. First, he explicitly shut down rumors of a business or political alliance with the Trump family. This is significant given the increasing intersection of cryptocurrency and U.S. politics. Second, he provided crucial clarity for Binance’s future by removing himself from the operational picture. His focus appears to be elsewhere, which begs the question: what’s next for CZ? Why Does This Denial Matter for Crypto? This news is more than just celebrity gossip. It has real implications for the cryptocurrency landscape. The denial of Trump family ties helps maintain a degree of separation between Binance’s legacy and U.S. political factions. This can be seen as a move to ensure the exchange’s brand remains neutral in a highly polarized environment. Moreover, confirming his exit from Binance management provides stability and finality. It allows the current leadership team to operate without the shadow of a founder’s potential return, enabling them to execute their long-term strategy for the exchange. For investors and users, this means: Continuity: Binance will continue under its established post-CZ governance. Clarity: Market uncertainty about leadership power struggles is reduced. Focus: The exchange can fully concentrate on compliance and product development. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Binance Without CZ? While Changpeng Zhao’s departure provides clarity, it doesn’t erase the challenges. Binance operates in an increasingly regulated global environment. The exchange must continue to build trust with regulators and institutions worldwide. Its ability to innovate while adhering to complex compliance frameworks is its biggest test. However, this challenge also presents an opportunity. Successfully navigating this new era could solidify Binance not just as a trading giant, but as a mature, enduring pillar of the financial world. What Can We Learn from Zhao’s Current Path? The actions of Changpeng Zhao offer an intriguing case study. After building a trillion-dollar empire, his current priorities seem to be defined by subtraction—stepping away from political entanglements and operational duties. This could indicate a strategic pivot towards passive investment, philanthropy, or mentorship within the crypto space. His journey reminds us that leadership isn’t always about holding the reins; sometimes, it’s about knowing when to let go to ensure an institution’s lasting legacy. Conclusion: A Chapter Closes, A New Narrative Begins Changpeng Zhao’s dual denial draws a firm line under two major narratives. The crypto world now has a clearer picture: one of its most famous founders is moving on, consciously avoiding political alliances and dedicating himself to a role beyond day-to-day exchange management. This allows Binance to write its next chapter independently, while the industry watches to see what chapter Changpeng Zhao chooses to write for himself. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly did Changpeng Zhao deny? A1: He denied having any cooperative relationship with the family of former U.S. President Donald Trump and confirmed he has no intention of returning to manage Binance’s daily operations. Q2: Why is the denial about the Trump family important? A2: It helps distance Binance from U.S. political factions, which is crucial for maintaining regulatory neutrality and broad market trust in a highly politicized environment. Q3: Does this mean Changpeng Zhao has left crypto entirely? A3: No. He has only stated he won’t return to Binance management. He remains a major shareholder and influential figure, and will likely remain involved in the crypto ecosystem in other ways. Q4: Who is running Binance now? A4: Binance is led by CEO Richard Teng and his executive team, who have been steering the company since Zhao stepped down as part of a settlement with U.S. authorities. Q5: How does this news affect Binance users? A5: It provides stability. Users can expect continuity in the platform’s operations and strategy under the current, confirmed leadership. Q6: Where did this news come from? A6: The initial report came from the crypto news source Wu Blockchain, which relayed the statements from Changpeng Zhao.

The transfer occurred during a period of intense demand for crypto ETFs and followed a sharp rise in XRP Ledger velocity, which reached its highest level of 2025. Ripple’s $101 Million Transfer Coincides With Rising Network Velocity Whale Alert data showed two consecutive transfers involving 46,019,328 XRP each. Ripple moved the funds from its “Ripple (50)” wallet to an internal address before routing the same amount to a wallet linked to Binance. The total value exceeded $101 million at current prices. Besides the liquidity shift, CryptoQuant data confirmed a sharp rise in XRP velocity on December 2. The metric climbed to 0.0324, marking this year’s highest reading. High velocity often signals strong network engagement and rapid circulation. Moreover, the surge indicates increased participation from traders and whales during a period of heightened volatility. Market activity intensified as investors monitored whether these movements would influence short-term liquidity conditions. Significantly, the token’s fast turnover suggested that market participants remain active despite the recent price pullback. Price Holds Below Resistance as Analysts Eye the $2.28 Breakout XRP traded at $2.13 as of press time, posting a mild daily decline while weekly losses remained near 2%. The market cap stood at $128.7 billion, with 60 billion tokens in circulation. The token continued moving inside a broad descending channel, which has consistently limited recovery attempts. Source: X This downward channel keeps traders focused on key resistance levels, with the $2.28 zone now standing as the first major barrier to upward momentum. Analyst Ali Martinez noted that a firm break above this area could open a path toward $2.47 and possibly $2.75. Additionally, traders view this level as a structural midpoint that could shift sentiment if reclaimed. A failure to clear $2.28 risks renewed downside, with $2.10 acting as the next support level inside the lower channel.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-04 15:26:34

That jump basically means the network got much busier: more real transactions, more payments, more trading, more movement overal,l instead of people just holding their XRP. A spike like that usually points to a highly active market, driven by either an influx of regular traders or a major move from whales. Source: XRP Velocity / CryptoQuant Data Shows Whales Are Behind the Move: $1.36 Billion XRP Accumulated Whale activity around XRP has surged, and it could set the stage for a move back toward those multi-week highs. Whales started loading up as XRP dipped toward the $2.00 psychological level earlier this week. On-chain data shows wallets holding between 100 million and 1 billion XRP scooped up around 620 million XRP in just a few days. At today’s prices, that is more than $1.36 billion worth of accumulation, which is not the kind of buying you ignore. Source: Shark Wallets Is Shrinking While Whales Continue To Accumulate / Santiment This data lines up with the whale-to-exchange chart , which hit its lowest levels of the year in October, November, and now December. When those flows drop, it usually means whales are not sending coins to exchanges, which is a clear sign they are not looking to sell. XRP Price Prediction: Can Whale Buying Finally Break the $2.20 Wall? Ripple inflows keep climbing, with ETF clients buying another $50.27 million worth of XRP, pushing total ETF-held assets to 906.46 million dollars. XRP is currently trading around 2.13 dollars, down about 2% in the last 24 hours, and it has failed to break above 2.20 again as the broader market pulled back. If XRP bulls can finally break above $2.20 or flip it into support, the price would be in a strong position to target 2.30 next. From there, XRP could even climb toward 2.50 and hit its highest level in three weeks. If it fails again, though, investor confidence takes a hit, and the price will likely drop back toward the last key support around $2.00. Bitcoin Hyper Could Be The Real Winner Of This Market Reset While XRP whales are loading billions and ETF demand keeps rising, one project is quietly pulling even stronger momentum from the market’s recovery: Bitcoin Hyper. It is shaping up to be one of the few early-cycle plays attracting both retail and big wallets at the same time. Bitcoin Hyper is building a fast Bitcoin Layer 2 using the Solana Virtual Machine, which means Solana-level speed and low fees but with Bitcoin security under the hood. That mix is exactly what traders are hunting for as liquidity rotates into real performance chains instead of slow legacy L2s. The presale numbers prove it. More than $28.9 million has already been raised, even while most altcoins are struggling to find direction. Early whales have been loading up aggressively, treating BTHY like a high-conviction early entry rather than a gamble. And with staking locked at a powerful 40% APY , holders are getting rewarded simply for staying put, which is the same formula that fueled the biggest breakout plays in past bull runs.

This of course comes as the yuan surged to a 14-month high on Wednesday, and these banks always try to slow the currency’s rally without triggering a total reversal using… the US dollar, as ironic as it may seem. These state lenders usually push the dollars into the swap market, but this time they just held on tight. The goal here folks, is to make it more expensive to hold long yuan positions by tightening access to dollars. State banks refuse to swap dollars, pressure yuan bulls FX markets reacted as back-end dollar/yuan swap points dropped sharply, a glaring code for a deeper negative carry, meaning if you’re holding yuan long-term, your yield sucks compared to dollars. The one-year tenor had just hit a one-month high last week, and now it’s slumping again. Sorry to you. But hey this doesn’t mean the yuan’s going into a nosedive, though it did weaken slightly to 7.072 per dollar after Reuters first broke the news. But again, to be fair, the yuan had already taken a hit earlier that morning, when the People’s Bank of China ( PBOC ) announced that it has fixed the trading band way lower than expected, setting it at 7.0733, a massive 164 pips away from the average estimate in a Bloomberg survey. That’s the widest weak-side gap since February 2022, and it shook the market. The fixing matters because it caps how far the onshore yuan can move, just 2% in either direction. Yuan gains show economic shift since Trump-era trade war The fact that the yuan’s even rallying this much shows how far China has come since the 2018-2019 trade war. Back then, the economy was chained to US demand. Now? Not so much. Exports have moved toward the Global South, and China has expanded its chokehold on key global supply chains, especially in rare earths , thanks to the gift that is President Donald Trump. But let’s not get carried away. On a trade-weighted basis, the yuan still doesn’t look that hot, so even with the recent spike, the real effective exchange rate (REER), which adjusts for inflation, is near its lowest point since 2011, according to data from the Bank for International Settlements. Year-to-date, the yuan is up about by 3.3% against the dollar, and it’s now pacing for its biggest yearly gain since 2020, the pandemic chaos year from hell.

XRP is currently picking up pace at a significant rate in regions such as Asia, and large companies are starting to adopt the leading altcoin in order to create a treasury reserve backed by the token. Japan-Listed Firm Goes Crypto With XRP Treasury As a leading asset in the cryptocurrency and financial landscape, XRP is making notable inroads into the Asian region. A publicly traded corporation in Japan has chosen to include the token directly on its balance sheet, causing a new uproar in the country’s corporate sector. Specifically, this move, which has sent ripples throughout the community, is being carried out by AltPlus, a company that focuses on the design, creation, and running of mobile and social games. The Japanese company has decided to engage with the altcoin by including it in its official treasury strategy, bolstering the XRP Treasury initiative. In the report shared by BankXRP, a crypto and DeFi enthusiast, outlined that the token is now officially part of the corporate strategy of AltPlus, marking its shift into the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape. This move reflects an act of conviction among institutional investors in an environment where the majority of corporations still keep a wary eye on digital assets . According to the pundit, the move was revealed in the company’s new shareholder filing. This new document confirms that the firm will purchase and hold XRP alongside Bitcoin , the flagship cryptocurrency, as a strategic asset. AltPlus aims at acquiring value in the long run, diversification, and staking-based income. The filing details a complete transition of AltPlus into digital assets as the company expands into crypto operations. In this way, the firm is improving its balance sheet and navigating Web3 connections across its gaming and Internet Protocol (IP) ecosystem. A Huge Wave Of Capital Flowing Into The Asset While the crypto market is slowly recovering, several major assets witnessed a massive wave of capital, with XRP being among the leaders in inflows . A significant inflow into the altcoin reflects the growing conviction among retail and institutional investors. Data from CoinShares disclosed by Coin Bureau on X shows that the altcoin pulled in capital worth $289 million in a week, which marks one of its biggest yet. The large inflow coincides with an improvement in investors’ sentiment toward the token, driven by strategic advancements in the larger ecosystem and expanding usefulness throughout international payment corridors. Meanwhile, the total net inflows for digital asset Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) recorded in a week were more than $1 billion, signaling intensifying market interest.

That future is now arriving, as global remittance giant MoneyGram announces a groundbreaking partnership with crypto infrastructure leader Fireblocks to introduce stablecoin payments . This move represents a seismic shift in how traditional finance embraces blockchain technology to solve real-world problems. What Does This MoneyGram and Fireblocks Partnership Actually Mean? MoneyGram, a household name in international money transfers, is teaming up with Fireblocks, a leading digital asset custody platform. Together, they’re building a new payment and treasury system powered by stablecoins like USDC. This system will operate across multiple blockchains, creating a more efficient infrastructure for global remittances. The partnership leverages Fireblocks’ secure digital asset infrastructure to enable MoneyGram to handle stablecoin payments seamlessly. This means customers could soon enjoy faster, cheaper international transfers compared to traditional banking systems. The collaboration bridges the gap between conventional finance and innovative blockchain solutions. Why Are Stablecoin Payments Such a Game-Changer for Remittances? Traditional cross-border payments face several challenges that stablecoin payments directly address. Let’s examine the key benefits: Speed: Transactions that typically take days can settle in minutes Cost Reduction: Lower fees compared to traditional banking corridors Accessibility: 24/7 availability without banking hours restrictions Transparency: Blockchain provides clear transaction tracking Security: Advanced cryptography protects against fraud MoneyGram’s move signals that major financial institutions now recognize blockchain’s practical utility beyond speculative trading. By implementing stablecoin payments , they’re addressing real pain points for millions of people who rely on remittances for essential needs. How Will This New System Actually Work for Users? The partnership creates a bridge between traditional fiat currency and digital assets. Here’s what users can expect: Customers will likely interact with familiar MoneyGram interfaces while the backend leverages Fireblocks’ technology to facilitate stablecoin payments . The system will convert local currency to stablecoins for transfer, then convert back to the recipient’s local currency at the destination. This two-way conversion happens seamlessly, shielding users from cryptocurrency volatility while delivering blockchain benefits. Fireblocks provides the secure infrastructure to manage these digital assets across their lifecycle. Their technology handles custody, transfer, and settlement of stablecoins while maintaining regulatory compliance. This allows MoneyGram to focus on customer experience while leveraging cutting-edge blockchain infrastructure. What Challenges Might This New System Face? Despite the exciting potential, implementing stablecoin payments at scale presents several hurdles: Regulatory Compliance: Navigating different financial regulations across countries User Education: Helping customers understand and trust the new system Technical Integration: Connecting legacy systems with blockchain infrastructure Market Volatility: Managing conversion risks even with stablecoins Competition: Other remittance providers developing similar solutions However, MoneyGram’s established regulatory relationships and Fireblocks’ proven technology create a strong foundation to address these challenges. Their partnership demonstrates how traditional and crypto-native companies can collaborate effectively. What Does This Mean for the Future of Global Payments? MoneyGram’s adoption of stablecoin payments represents a tipping point for blockchain adoption in mainstream finance. When established companies with millions of customers embrace this technology, it validates the practical utility of cryptocurrencies beyond investment vehicles. This development could accelerate similar partnerships across the financial industry. Other remittance providers may follow suit, creating competitive pressure that benefits consumers through better services and lower costs. The infrastructure developed through this partnership could eventually support additional financial services beyond simple transfers. Ultimately, the success of MoneyGram’s stablecoin payments system could demonstrate blockchain’s real-world value to regulators, policymakers, and skeptical traditional financial institutions. It represents a concrete step toward a more inclusive, efficient global financial system. Conclusion: A New Era for Cross-Border Payments The MoneyGram-Fireblocks partnership marks a significant milestone in financial technology evolution. By implementing stablecoin payments , they’re not just adopting new technology—they’re reimagining how value moves across borders. This collaboration demonstrates that blockchain solutions can solve practical problems for real people, particularly those who rely on remittances for their livelihoods. As this system rolls out, watch for reduced transfer times, lower fees, and improved accessibility in global money movement. The partnership serves as a blueprint for how traditional finance can integrate blockchain innovation while maintaining regulatory compliance and user trust. The future of remittances is becoming faster, cheaper, and more transparent—one stablecoin transaction at a time. Frequently Asked Questions What are stablecoin payments?

However, this recovery didn't last. BTC experienced heavy selling on Monday, falling to $84,000, marking a rough start to both the week and December, the last month of the year. However, this selling wave was short-lived. Bitcoin and altcoins quickly recovered after two days of declines. As BTC surged back above $93,000, these sudden price swings have divided the market. Some analysts say the decline could continue, while others argue that Bitcoin is holding onto a strong support area and a bottom is near. Has Bitcoin Really Bottomed? At this point, Bitfinex analysts also took the side that argued that the bottom was near. Bitfinex argued in its weekly Alpha report that the Bitcoin price is showing signs of bottoming out. The exchange pointed to several indicators, including excessive deleveraging, capitulation by short-term holders, and seller exhaustion, where selling pressure is rapidly diminishing, suggesting that Bitcoin is very close to the cycle bottom. “The recent recovery aligns with our previous view that the market is approaching a local bottom in terms of time, although we don't yet know if we've seen a bottom in terms of price.” According to Bitfinex analysts, these factors suggest that the Bitcoin price has entered a stabilization phase, creating the necessary conditions for a sustained recovery in the short term. While Bitfinex analysts stated that there are many indicators pointing to a bottom in Bitcoin, one analyst said that it is too early to say that Bitcoin has reached the bottom. It's Too Early to Talk About a Bottom in Bitcoin! Cryptocurrency analyst Ted Pillows argued in his latest analysis that it is too early to confirm a bottom has formed for Bitcoin because the asset has not yet established clear support. Pillows noted that his bottom predictions were weakened as BTC failed to hold key support levels like $100,000, $95,000, and $90,000 and easily fell below them. Stating that BTC is currently stuck at the $93,000-$94,000 level and cannot create a stable support, the analyst said that an upward break of this level again would open the door to $100,000. On the other hand, a rejection from this level could push Bitcoin back below the $90,000 level. *This is not investment advice.

From major institutional signals to regulatory updates and leadership changes, a handful of headlines stood out but may have slipped under the radar. To help you stay updated, here’s a quick roundup of the biggest crypto stories you may have missed, including Charles Schwab’s surprising openness to crypto-focused M&A deals, new leadership moves at Binance, fresh policy shifts in the UK, and Coinbase’s latest partnerships with major U.S. banks. Charles Schwab Open to Crypto Firm Acquisitions The biggest headline came from traditional finance powerhouse Charles Schwab, whose CEO, Rick Wurster, told Reuters that the company is open to pursuing more mergers and acquisitions involving crypto firms. He said this would happen if the right opportunity presents itself. Wurster’s remarks come as the firm prepares to introduce spot crypto trading services in the first half of next year, a sign that Schwab may be accelerating its push into the digital asset space. Binance Names Yi He as Co-CEO In another major update this week, Binance appointed co-founder Yi He as its new co-CEO, joining Richard Teng in leading the exchange. Yi He, who has long overseen branding, community, and product growth, will now take on broader operational responsibilities. The new co-CEO has been vital to the growth of the Binance community and product innovation. Her appointment marks one of the company’s most significant leadership changes since founder Changpeng Zhao stepped down in late 2023. UK Formally Recognizes Crypto as Property On the regulatory front, the United Kingdom has officially passed a law that classifies cryptocurrencies as objects of personal property. The new framework, which took effect on December 3, provides greater legal clarity around ownership, disputes, recovery, and enforcement involving digital assets. Lawmakers and market participants see the new law as a welcome development, as it gives digital assets a clear legal footing. Before now, cryptocurrencies were recognized as property only through individual court decisions, not by law. Coinbase Partners With Major U.S. Banks on Stablecoin and Crypto Pilots Turning to institutional developments in the U.S., Coinbase is working with several large banks on pilot programs exploring stablecoin payments, crypto trading, and custody services. The initiative is designed to help banks test crypto infrastructure as Wall Street institutions cautiously expand their digital-asset capabilities. This development marks a notable shift, reflecting renewed institutional interest despite broader market uncertainty.

Fireblocks, which handles more than $5T payments annually, will work as the on-chain infrastructure for remittances. Moneygram and Fireblocks will attempt to bring faster, low-cost payments with real-time settlements based on stablecoin transfers. Fireblocks has already proven its capability by settling over $5T in annual transfers. The partnership will connect over 200 countries and territories, 20,000 payment gateways, and nearly half a million retailers. Moneygram already onboards 50M people for cross-border remittances, with its main advantage being its ability to track and apply local regulatory requirements in every market. The adoption of the Fireblocks payment system will thus become a part of the service as a fully compliant transaction layer. “ We are leading the next era of money movement by enabling money to move instantly across any channel – fiat or stablecoin,” said Anthony Soohoo, Chairman and CEO of MoneyGram. “ Fireblocks accelerates this vision by giving us the secure, programmable infrastructure to transform global payments at scale,” he said. Moneygram will also serve as the last stretch of transfers, offering global cash on-ramps and selling for digital currencies. Fireblocks to offer extra security to Moneygram stablecoin payments Moneygram offers stablecoin coverage to 170 countries worldwide. Fireblocks will build on this expansion by offering more secure stablecoin infrastructure, as well as a programmable settlement layer. Moneygram is tapping stablecoins as a way to avoid taxation. As Cryptopolitan reported , Trump’s tariff bill introduced a 5% tax on remittances, which does not extend to stablecoin transfers. The payment company will use Fireblocks for multi-chain stablecoin transfers. The faster channels will reduce the need for capital reserves, instead resorting to instant stablecoin payments. Moneygram will also tap existing stablecoin liquidity pools and streamline settlement. Fireblocks will also provide seamless integration to exchanges, adding to the available liquidity. The ecosystem will allow the onboarding of new types of stablecoins, without requiring fundamental changes to Moneygram’s user experience. “ MoneyGram is rebuilding the rails of cross-border settlement in real time,” said Michael Shaulov, Co-Founder and CEO of Fireblocks. “ By moving to a multi-chain, programmable infrastructure, it’s upgrading the speed and reliability of global payments at the foundation layer – where it matters most for the people who rely on these payments every day,” he said. Fireblocks already offers its services to over 1,800 organizations, securing 550M wallets worldwide. Global stablecoin payments get a boost from stablecoins Stablecoins emerged as one of the best crypto use cases in 2025. Stablecoin transfers make up to 30% of all crypto activity. Stablecoin payments peaked in 2025, making up to 30% of all crypto transfers. | Source: Visa Onchain Analytics The speed and instant settlement of stablecoins have also appealed to fintech apps. A larger number of end users are also using crypto wallets as a primary financial tool, and are used to funds arriving instantly. Moneygram aims to emulate the way crypto wallets are used to achieve faster cross-border payments. The payment provider, however, takes care of the last stretch in swapping the funds into immediately usable fiat.

According to Glassnode's latest analysis, this threshold typically separates standard corrections from severe bear markets. The data provider noted that Bitcoin's broader market structure now mirrors dynamics observed during the first quarter of 2022. During that period, the cryptocurrency maintained positions above the True Market Mean from late January through early May before breaking down. The subsequent collapse saw prices plunge 61% to $15,500 by November 2022. Source: Glassnode Additional evidence comes from the Supply Quantiles Cost Basis model, which tracks entry prices for significant coin holdings. Bitcoin has traded below the 0.75 quantile since mid-November, leaving more than 25% of the total supply underwater. The 0.75 quantile currently stands at $96,100. Glassnode warned that the market remains in a fragile state, balanced between potential capitulation from recent buyers and possible seller exhaustion. The firm emphasized that Bitcoin needs to reclaim the 0.85 quantile around $106,200 as support to stabilize the current structure. Bear Flag Pattern Points to $68,000 Target Technical analysis reinforces the bearish outlook. Bitcoin faces strong resistance at $93,000, which aligns with the yearly opening price and the upper boundary of a developing bear flag pattern. Bear flags typically form during downtrends and signal continuation of the prevailing bearish momentum. The pattern projects a measured move target of $68,150 if Bitcoin closes below the flag's lower boundary at $91,000. This level corresponds to the previous all-time high established in 2021. A move to $68,000 would represent a 27% decline from current levels. The relative strength index sits at 40 on the two-day chart, indicating weak momentum that favors sellers. CryptoQuant's Bull Score Index offers further confirmation of deteriorating market conditions. The metric has remained below 40 since October, currently registering in the 0-20 range. These readings match levels seen in January 2022, just before the extended bear market began.

Bitcoin is trading near $92,000 with steadier ranges and lower liquidation pressure, which improves conditions across major spot venues and reduces the abrupt volatility that shaped the past two weeks. This shift does not yet create the conditions for a full altcoin season, although it does support selective rotation into projects that maintain clear usage or active development tracks. Curve DAO Token, Bittensor, and Avalanche fit that profile today with moves that align with themes still drawing attention despite restrained risk appetite. Curve DAO Token Sees Quiet Repricing Curve DAO Token (CRV) is trading near $0.42 , up by about 8% in 24 hours, supported by deeper liquidity and higher participation across stablecoin pools. The token’s position inside large liquidity routes keeps it relevant when traders prefer tokens linked to functional DeFi infrastructure rather than speculative stories. Recent volumes show more consistent order flow after a stretch of uneven activity, and the market continues to monitor Curve’s incentive structure and ongoing work on pool adjustments. These elements form a practical base for CRV during a period when many DeFi tokens are still recovering from last week’s pressure. Bittensor Steadies With Ongoing AI Network Activity Bittensor (TAO) is now trading around $299, up by roughly 6%. Activity across its subnet ecosystem remains healthy, and staking and validator metrics show stable engagement with decentralized compute work. TAO Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) The token benefits from continuing interest in open artificial intelligence networks that provide measurable output rather than relying entirely on narrative-driven momentum. This stability has helped TAO avoid the deeper swings seen in other high-profile tokens during the recent fear phase. The current move aligns with gradual repositioning toward networks supported by ongoing participation and verifiable utility. Avalanche Improves As Liquidity Returns AVAX is near $14.7 , up by about 5% in 24 hours. The token moves with recovering liquidity across its major pairs and with activity linked to subnets and scaling efforts. While overall rotation remains selective, Avalanche continues to draw interest from participants who want exposure to layer one ecosystems that still report consistent development and deployment. What does it mean to be “Powered by Avalanche”? pic.twitter.com/8yPA9UQq5l — Avalanche (@avax) December 4, 2025 The token’s climb remains measured but fits today’s environment, which favors projects that maintain active pipelines and steady integration work rather than those driven only by short-term sentiment. Altcoin Season Outlook As Pressure Fades The shift from extreme fear to a reading near 27 creates slightly better conditions for altcoins, although markets still operate within cautious ranges. Bitcoin’s stable behavior near 92000 reduces the abrupt swings that halted rotation last week and allows flows to return gradually to DeFi, artificial intelligence, and layer one networks. CRV, TAO, and AVAX show how the earliest stages of rotation can form when sentiment improves at the margins. While this is not yet a full altcoin season, the combination of reduced volatility and clearer engagement across these networks indicates that market structure is steadier than during last week’s low point.

Strategy Shifts Another $1 Billion in Bitcoin to Fidelity Strategy Inc., formerly MicroStrategy, has moved a fresh batch of 11,642 Bitcoin to Fidelity’s custody in the past day, according to on-chain tracking data shared by market analysts. The latest transfer is worth about 1 billion dollars at recent prices and continues the company’s push to consolidate its holdings with the asset manager. Strategy Billion Dollar Bitcoin Move. Source: Arkham / X With this move, Strategy has now sent roughly 177,351 BTC, valued near 16.5 billion dollars, to Fidelity in total. The transfers appear in several large chunks, each labeled as moving from Strategy wallets to “Fidelity Custody,” underscoring the scale of the company’s Bitcoin treasury operations as it adjusts how and where its coins are held. Mizuho Reaffirms Buy Rating on Strategy With 484 Dollar Price Target Meanwhile, Mizuho Financial Group has reaffirmed its buy rating on Strategy Inc., the Bitcoin-focused treasury company formerly known as MicroStrategy, while keeping its 484 dollar price target unchanged. The endorsement signals continued confidence in the firm’s leveraged Bitcoin strategy as it expands both its holdings and balance-sheet instruments tied to the asset. Mizuho reiterated the rating after recent discussions with Strategy executives, who outlined the company’s approach to debt management, potential equity raises and ongoing Bitcoin accumulation. Analysts said the firm’s structure still supports upside as long as Bitcoin maintains its broader trend and Strategy continues executing its treasury strategy without major shifts. The note arrives as Strategy’s market value moves in lockstep with Bitcoin’s price swings, making analyst coverage closely watched by investors. Mizuho’s stance places the bank among those that see further room for the stock to climb as the company continues positioning itself as a publicly traded Bitcoin proxy. Analyst Points to ‘Munger Rule’ on Strategy’s 200-Week Support Market strategist James E.

According to real-time data from Binance’s USDT market, Bitcoin is currently trading at $93,065.99. This surge isn’t just a number; it represents a powerful shift in market sentiment and investor confidence. Let’s dive into what’s fueling this rally and explore its potential implications. What’s Driving the Current BTC Price Surge? Several key factors are converging to push the BTC price to new heights. First, institutional adoption continues to gain momentum, with major financial firms increasing their Bitcoin holdings. Second, macroeconomic conditions, such as concerns about inflation, are driving investors toward assets perceived as stores of value. Finally, positive regulatory developments in several jurisdictions are reducing uncertainty and building a more stable foundation for growth. This combination creates a perfect storm for bullish momentum. How Significant is the $93,000 Level for Bitcoin? Crossing the $93,000 mark is a major psychological and technical achievement. Historically, Bitcoin has faced strong resistance at round-number thresholds. Breaking through this level can trigger a wave of automated buying from trading algorithms and attract new investors who were waiting on the sidelines. Therefore, maintaining support above $93,000 is crucial for the rally to continue its upward trajectory toward the next major target. Key Takeaways for Investors Watching the BTC Price Volatility Remains: While the trend is positive, sharp pullbacks are common in crypto markets. Long-Term Perspective: Focus on the underlying adoption trends, not just daily price swings. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on price movements; understand the asset. Could This Rally Face Challenges Ahead? However, every rally faces potential headwinds. The primary challenge for the current BTC price advance is profit-taking. Early investors may decide to sell portions of their holdings to lock in gains, which can create selling pressure. Additionally, broader market corrections or unexpected negative regulatory news could temporarily dampen enthusiasm. It’s wise for traders to have a risk management strategy in place for such scenarios. Actionable Insights from the $93,000 BTC Price Level What should you do with this information? For existing holders, this might be a time to review your portfolio allocation. For newcomers, consider a disciplined approach like dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to mitigate timing risk. Most importantly, use reliable sources for market data and analysis. The current BTC price action underscores Bitcoin’s growing role in the global financial landscape, but informed decisions are always the best decisions. Conclusion: A Landmark Moment for Bitcoin In summary, Bitcoin’s breach of $93,000 is a landmark event that highlights its resilience and growing mainstream acceptance. The BTC price is not just a metric; it’s a reflection of evolving technology, finance, and societal trust. While the future path will have twists and turns, this achievement solidifies Bitcoin’s position at the forefront of the digital asset revolution. Staying informed and measured is the key to navigating this exciting market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What was the exact BTC price mentioned in the article?

However, even as this short-term euphoria sets in, analysts have noted that XRP is currently working within a number of underlying zones of resistance, as well as a top-heavy market profile, that far outweigh its ability to realistically increase much above its own short-term momentum trends, making now a particularly pressing time for holders to include a wider review of this season’s best crypto assets to invest, among them now being Mutuum Finance , represented by its cryptographic asset, or ‘token,’ MUTM. Entering a season of prominence for being a strong favorite for 2026 for its unique offering and much-needed freshness, Mutuum Finance is now standing at $0.035, with a total of over 18,310 holders and a raised figure of almost $19.1 million—a development that is now rapidly propelling Mutuum Finance through, or towards the finish of, its phase 6, now on the verge of being sold out. As momentum grows, investors increasingly classify MUTM as the top crypto to invest in, reinforcing the conviction of early adopters. Ripple Exhibits Bullish Trend; However, Traders Are Looking for Alternatives Ripple (XRP) is experiencing visibly strong positive sentiment, now that the Supertrend is indicating a positive trend, a strong flag pattern is being developed, and the price is overcoming the 23.6% Fib marker. Strong fund inflows and growing transactions have also contributed to positive sentiment, but analysts forecast a possible transient advance to the 50% Fib marker of $2.46, or even a possible positive trend towards $3. Although XRP is moving along a positive trend, smart money is now considering better alternatives that balance pioneers, strong functionality, and high potential for significant gains, making way for new entrants such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which many investors now define as the best crypto to rotate into for 2025–2026. Mutuum Finance Presale Speeds Up as Phase 6 is Almost Finished Mutuum Finance began its presale back in early 2025, beginning at a price of $0.01 for each of its tokens. Since then, the price is up to $0.035, representing a 250% increase prior to the launch. Every previous phase was filled quickly, keeping a steady pace of growing interests from the world of crypto. Phase 6 is almost fully allocated, making this one of the most dynamic phases of this initial sale. It is quite apparent that all who participate here understand that the price of the tokens will increase, once this phase ends, moving closer to its official launch price of $0.06, making this phase of the initial sale a fantastic chance to invest for under $0.04. Over $19.1 million raised so far, making this one of the most successful new crypto platforms of 2025 and cementing MUTM as a top crypto to invest in this cycle. Widening Holder Base and Worldwide Acceptance The number of holders of the project’s token is continuously growing and is now above 18,300 holders. This is a sign that there is growing interest from both the initial adopters and the new ones who have joined the presale for the first time. The platform of MUTM has managed to attract attention from crypto lovers across the world. Of the total 4 billion tokens that make up MUTM, 45.5%, or 1.82 billion, is set to be distributed through the presale. Over 800 million of these tokens have already been sold, and this means that only a limited number of tokens can now be acquired. This scarcity of tokens continues to build a compelling sense of urgency and FOMO among those who have, or who intend to acquire, the tokens when the price of the crypto is bound to get even closer to its initial launch price of $0.06. Such accelerating demand reinforces why investors position MUTM as the best crypto to accumulate before 2026. Roadmap Advancement and Protocol Development The current phase that this project is undergoing is Phase 2 of its roadmap. It deals with the development of smart contracts, backend development, risk models, liquidation, and analytics. The pace of development and regular updates from the developers indicate that this platform is committed to providing a safe, scalable, and sound decentralized finance system. The development that is being undertaken by this platform is positioning the platform to be a strong system for adoption at the launch of its version 1. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is close to a sellout of its Phase 6, boasting over 18,310 supporters and $19.1M raised. Pricing is currently at $0.035, well beneath its initial exchange price of $0.06. Additionally, a growing worldwide presence, developed DeFi platform, and the upcoming testnet for version one of the Sepolia network make this one of the top crypto to invest in heading into 2026. With utility-driven demand, expanding adoption, and infrastructure development, many early adopters already regard MUTM as the best crypto to hold long-term for the upcoming market cycle.

The introduction of COP funding reflects Kraken’s continued investment in building infrastructure enabling individuals to have secure and frictionless access to crypto around the world. With local payment integration now live, clients in Colombia can deposit COP directly through trusted domestic payment methods. Deposits are automatically converted to USD at competitive, transparent exchange rates – eliminating the need for international wire transfers and streamlining the overall user experience. “Colombia is one of the most dynamic crypto markets in Latin America, with a digitally engaged population and a growing appetite for decentralized financial tools,” said Mark Greenberg, Kraken Global Head of Consumer. “This integration marks an important step in giving Colombian clients more accessible, secure entry points into the global crypto economy.” Crypto adoption in Colombia continues to grow steadily, driven by increased financial digitization, strong interest in stablecoins, and demand for cross-border remittance options. Kraken’s local funding support reduces onboarding friction and brings institutional-grade infrastructure to one of the region’s most active digital asset communities. This milestone is part of Kraken’s broader strategy to scale its presence across Latin America, beginning with foundational infrastructure in key markets including Argentina, Mexico, and Colombia. Kraken’s expansion in Colombia is underpinned by a commitment to delivering relevant, local solutions to clients. Colombian clients now benefit from: Local COP payment rails Access to 500+ digital assets and global liquidity Competitive FX rates and transparent pricing Industry-leading security and 24/7 support This rollout positions Kraken to support a wide range of Colombian clients – from first-time crypto participants to advanced traders.

Dedic frames his outlook using the classic technology adoption curve, which splits the market into innovators (2.5%), early adopters (13.5%), an early majority (34%), late majority (34%) and laggards (16%). The critical “chasm” lies between early adopters—“people who want newest things” and accept a minimum feature set—and the early majority, who demand a “whole product solution” and prioritize complete, convenient offerings. In his base case, Dedic argues that crypto is now close to exiting that chasm. If so, he says, “the classic 4-year cycles are dead. The market will have matured and will increasingly correlate with macro cycles and industry fundamentals rather than self-fulfilling narratives.” Under this scenario, pricing would be governed less by reflexive narratives around halvings or “altseason” and more by the sector’s real economic role and its interaction with broader financial conditions. Related Reading: This Is The ‘Strangest’ Crypto Sell-Off Ever, Claims Arca CIO He assigns a 20% probability to a less advanced stage of adoption in which the industry is “still in the early-adopter phase and only now beginning to cross the chasm.” In that case, he believes crypto could face “a 1-3 year bear market while the industry finds itself and pushes toward early-majority adoption.” Here, the established four-year pattern could remain intact, with another prolonged downturn before mainstream product-market fit is fully achieved. The remaining 5% is reserved for a failure scenario in which the sector never secures such fit. “We get stuck in the chasm and never find true mainstream pmf,” Dedic writes, warning that crypto could then “turn into a zero sum game and we will just PvP trade money from one to the other.” Related Reading: Risk Runs Hot: Massive Crypto Liquidation Wave Slams Traders Overnight Dedic makes clear he views that outcome as unlikely. He cites “regulatory tailwinds, institutional adoption, and the accelerating fundamentals of our industry” as reasons to believe the market is already in scenario one, “standing right in front of the biggest adoption wave crypto has ever seen, and likely ever will see.” He also argues that market structure and culture must evolve alongside adoption. “The 4 year cycles and simple narrative chasing are dead,” he says. While “the onchain online casino will always be part of our identity, it will shrink into a niche. It’s time for the industry to mature and start playing the serious game.” For Dedic, that conviction is not theoretical. “An incredible decade lies ahead for those willing to evolve,” he concludes, adding that he is “betting basically all my money on the idea that this is only just getting started.” At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.15 trillion.

After shaking hands and hugging each other, as well as making jokes we didn’t really get, CZ immediately attacked Peter’s “obsession with tokenized gold,” saying it relies too much on trust and central control. Peter started the whole thing by doing what he now does best; dismissing Bitcoin entirely , once again saying that it’s nothing more than “a speculative asset” with no built-in value. “What makes Bitcoin worthless, as far as I’m concerned, is not the fact that I can’t touch it,” Peter said. CZ simply watched with a smile and nodded. Peter continued: “It’s that you can’t do anything with it. It doesn’t have utility beyond the fact that… I can transfer it to you, and you can transfer it to somebody else.” He kept hammering that Bitcoin has no function, and tried to frame it as some kind of hot potato. Then he turned to what he believes actually works; tokenized gold . “When I transfer tokenized gold to you, I’ve transferred gold. I’ve transferred the ownership of the gold,” Peter said. His problem with Bitcoin was apparently about what he called “actual transfer of ownership.” document.createElement('video'); https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ChmYFQjhNk0sWl76-1.mp4 But CZ, the crypto community’s fighter, simply brought out a piece of gold from his pocket, held it up and said, “With this, it’s not easy for me to take it across countries. Whereas Bitcoin… has actually gone up in value over the last 15 years.” Peter abruptly accuses Binance of running a casino Peter didn’t let it go. He pushed hard on Bitcoin being nothing more than a giant bet. “More people are gambling in Bitcoin today than were gambling in it a couple of years ago,” he said, painting it like a risky coin toss, not a serious asset. He then went straight at CZ, saying, “You’re running a pretty big casino.” And he brought numbers to twist the knife. “Bitcoin today buys 40% fewer ounces of gold than it did four years ago,” he said, trying to show that Bitcoin had actually lost value when measured in gold. He listed off the hype Bitcoin has gotten over the years: “We had ETFs… celebrity endorsements… the NFT craze… El Salvador. We’ve had all of this promotion… and the price has gone down.” His whole case? The excitement didn’t deliver results. But CZ wasn’t having it. He clapped back, saying people use virtual things all the time that hold real value. “When you use X, X is completely virtual. There’s nothing physical about it. But X has value,” CZ said. “The Internet is virtual… but it has value.” He made it clear that Bitcoin’s value comes from its portability and global reach, especially when compared to something like gold. Then, taking aim at Peter’s casino insult, he shot back: “When you reach this level of like hundreds of millions of people, it’s no longer a casino.” Schiff drags Michael Saylor and Strategy into the mess Peter didn’t stop with CZ. He dragged Michael Saylor into the mess, going after his company Strategy’s debt-fueled Bitcoin binge. “Michael Saylor is coming out here; Bitcoin is going to be $10 million a Bitcoin,” Peter said. Then he challenged the logic: “Well, why isn’t it there now? If it’s really that valuable, the market would adjust the price now.” He questioned why the market hadn’t already priced it in. He also slammed the way Strategy built its position. “We got… Strategy that borrowed $40 billion to buy Bitcoin, or issued stock and debt to buy $40 billion,” he said. According to Peter, that kind of leverage just pumped the price. Then he mocked Saylor’s certainty: “He acts like you just buy Bitcoin and you’re guaranteed to make all this money. It’s a sure thing. Go out, mortgage your house… put everything you have.” Peter shifted back to his gold pitch. He promoted his own tokenized-gold project. “Right now… you can buy physical gold and silver, and we store it for you… it’s allocated gold,” he said. His argument? You don’t need governments, just a trustworthy private firm to tokenize real gold. “Any private entity that has a good reputation and is trustworthy can tokenize gold… they’re all fungible because gold is gold.” Peter closed by warning that young people would eventually turn on Bitcoin: “Young people will like gold more because their friends will have lost a lot of money in Bitcoin.” CZ just dropped adoption stats in response: “Three hundred million people on Binance alone all have some kind of Bitcoin.” That’s one way to end a debate .

We are LIVE now from the #BinanceBlockchainWeek Main Stage! The much-anticipated big debate is kicking off, don’t miss a moment! Watch it live https://t.co/4ED3HwmOj9 pic.twitter.com/BaC6S7QN58 — Binance (@binance) December 4, 2025 The debate tackled a defining question for the global financial landscape: Is the future of sound money rooted in Bitcoin or will tokenized gold ultimately prevail? The atmosphere was charged with investors, developers, policymakers, and institutional delegates filling the main hall for what quickly became a clash of ideology, economics, and technology. Schiff: Tokenized Gold Enhances What Already Works Peter Schiff framed tokenized gold not as competition to Bitcoin but as the modernization of a centuries-tested store of value. “Tokenized gold improves all the monetary properties of gold while it remains a store of value. The token is simply the evidence that you own the gold in the vault.” He argued that technology solves the core logistical weakness of gold—portability—without undermining its intrinsic qualities. “For money purposes, tokenized gold is better than physical gold. Ownership can change hands while the gold never leaves the vault.” Schiff reminded the audience that gold’s value is anchored in utility, rarity, and historical trust. “What gives gold value is not that you can touch it, but that it has real utility as a metal. There are industries that need gold and things only gold can do.” For Schiff, tokenization is evolutionary not revolutionary—retaining the asset while removing friction. CZ: Digital Value Needs No Physical Form CZ countered with the argument that Bitcoin is native to the internet economy and benefits from being purely digital. “If I give you Bitcoin right now, we can verify it in several ways that you received it. It settles instantly and transparently on-chain.” He positioned Bitcoin as more than a currency—it’s a global decentralized ecosystem. “Bitcoin is more than a transaction network. It is an entire industry with many use cases and a very large, global community behind it.” CZ dismissed the notion that money requires physical backing to be credible, comparing Bitcoin’s value to that of tech platforms. “The internet is virtual. There is nothing physical about Google or X, but they clearly have value. Many virtual things have value; that value is not tied to physical properties.” Two Philosophies, One Converging Future The debate highlighted a broader shift: traditional assets are being digitized, while native digital assets continue to mature. Tokenized gold caters to those who value tangible backing and historical stability; Bitcoin speaks to a generation aligned with decentralization and borderless liquidity. If Binance Blockchain Week made one thing clear, it’s that the future of money may not be defined by one asset — but by how well traditional and digital systems coexist, compete, and inevitably converge.

Here’s How,https://timestabloid.com/finance-strategist-to-xrp-holders-the-next-real-crash-will-happen-heres-how/,"The financial world appears stable, yet unseen pressures are quietly building beneath the surface. Stablecoins, often treated as safe anchors, may trigger the next systemic financial shock. What seems reliable today could rapidly destabilize markets tomorrow, impacting both crypto and traditional finance. Versan Aljarrah, founder of Black Swan Capitalist, recently emphasized this looming danger in a post on X. He warned that the next major crash might not come from Bitcoin or traditional altcoins, but from stablecoins — the instruments forming the backbone of crypto liquidity. Investors often underestimate the fragility of these assets and the systemic risks they carry. Tether: The Fragile Backbone of Crypto At the center of concern is Tether (USDT) , the world’s largest stablecoin. USDT anchors liquidity across exchanges, wallets, and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, making it critical to the crypto ecosystem. Yet a rising portion of its reserves now includes volatile or illiquid assets, including crypto loans, corporate bonds, and other non-cash instruments. This increases the likelihood of a sudden depeg if confidence collapses or mass redemptions occur. Jim Rickards says the next real crash will come from stablecoins. He’s not wrong. Tether isn’t “too big to fail.” It’s too big to expose, protected only as long as it serves the system. Once its usefulness ends, it becomes the scapegoat for the next financial reset. pic.twitter.com/h8y2n1KG4R — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) December 3, 2025 S&P Global Ratings recently downgraded USDT to the lowest stability tier, signaling concern about its ability to maintain the dollar peg under stress. This downgrade highlights that Tether’s stability depends on market trust, not fully liquid and transparent reserves. Contagion Risks Across Crypto and Traditional Finance Stablecoin failure is not isolated. These tokens are embedded across trading systems, leveraged positions, and collateral structures. A sudden Tether run could force rapid liquidation of risky assets, destabilizing its peg. Other stablecoins might follow, spreading volatility across exchanges, wallets, and DeFi protocols. Tether’s holdings in U.S. Treasury bills and corporate debt create potential ripple effects in traditional finance. Liquidity and trust across broader financial markets could be impacted. The systemic nature of stablecoins makes their failure more dangerous than typical altcoin crashes. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why This Crash Could Surpass Bitcoin’s Past Volatility Altcoin crashes usually affect specific market segments. Stablecoins, however, intersect nearly every layer of trading, lending, and collateral systems. Failure could freeze liquidity, spike volatility, and threaten leveraged positions and derivatives globally. This risk could extend into traditional finance, potentially triggering a broader financial reset. Implications for XRP Holders For XRP holders, stablecoin turbulence presents both risks and opportunities. Liquidity crunches could temporarily reduce trading volumes and increase volatility, affecting short-term prices. At the same time, investors fleeing unstable stablecoins may seek transparent alternatives, potentially driving increased demand for XRP. Understanding liquidity, trust, and market behavior is essential for positioning strategically. Monitoring and Mitigation Investors should track reserve disclosures, regulatory updates, and on-chain stablecoin flows closely. Diversifying crypto holdings and avoiding reliance on a single stablecoin can mitigate potential losses. Awareness of macro-level financial risks, combined with on-chain monitoring, is critical for navigating potential crises. Preparing for the Next Financial Reset Versan Aljarrah’s warning underscores a critical truth: stablecoins are structural, not speculative, assets. Their collapse could trigger a systemic financial reset. XRP holders and crypto investors must remain vigilant, balancing risk awareness with strategic opportunities. Understanding these underlying pressures is essential to survive and thrive in a market where trust and liquidity define stability.

As Bitcoin adoption grows, demand is shifting away from simple price bets toward real infrastructure for fast payments, DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) introduces a Bitcoin-anchored Layer 2 that uses the Solana Virtual Machine to fix Bitcoin’s slow transactions, high fees, and lack of smart contracts. Competition among Bitcoin Layer 2 networks will heat up as macro pressures and institutional inflows reward projects that mix Bitcoin’s trust with real performance. Surging US debt and sticky deficits are no longer a quiet background issue. They are starting to feel like the entire plot. BlackRock’s recent AI-driven research makes it clear: nonstop Treasury issuance and rising interest costs put pressure on long-term bonds. When the concept of a risk-free asset starts wobbling, investors begin asking the classic question: where do we turn next? Bitcoin keeps showing up in those conversations. After the spot ETF wave, $BTC turned into a boardroom-friendly hedge. If US debt continues to climb, a supply-capped and rules-based asset starts looking pretty good. That is the broad idea BlackRock is pointing toward. But once institutions agree Bitcoin belongs in the hedge bucket, the next question hits fast: how do you actually use $BTC inside today’s high-speed markets? On-chain Bitcoin is slow, block space is tight, and fees can spike into tens of dollars when the network gets busy. Great for cold storage. Not great for anything that needs to move quickly. This is the gap Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to front-run. It markets itself as a high-performance Bitcoin Layer 2 built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) , offering sub-second settlement and smart contracts while anchoring its security to Bitcoin. If BlackRock’s macro outlook drives more capital into $BTC, Bitcoin Hyper aims to be the platform where that capital actually generates results. Think payments, DeFi, gaming, NFTs, and more. Why Debt Risks And Institutional Flows Favor High-Throughput Bitcoin Infrastructure If the U.S. is heading toward chronic deficits, higher rates, and nonstop Treasury issuance, then long-duration bonds stop looking like a safe parking spot and start acting like a stress test. That is why large asset managers talk about needing new hedges. Bitcoin fits that role, as do gold and tokenized assets backed by real collateral. As institutions add Bitcoin exposure, the pressure builds to make $BTC usable, not just something you lock in a vault. Lightning facilitates payments, but it does not support complex smart contracts or high-performance DeFi applications. Ethereum rollups and Solana solve those problems, but they are not secured by Bitcoin, which matters to investors who want their hedge and their infrastructure to be based on the same monetary foundation. That is why the race among Bitcoin-aligned Layer 2s and sidechains is speeding up. Stacks, Rootstock, and others are trying to push programmability closer to Bitcoin, each making different trade-offs. Bitcoin Hyper is one of the new crypto projects taking a more ambitious approach: instead of building a new system, it uses the Solana VM and anchors it to Bitcoin. It is like taking a sports car engine and dropping it into a truck known for reliability. Inside Bitcoin Hyper’s SVM Layer 2 And The Ongoing Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) focuses heavily on speed. The design is modular: Bitcoin Layer 1 handles settlement and data availability, while an SVM-powered Layer 2 handles execution. Developers can use Rust and Solana-style tools, but the chain ultimately settles back to $BTC instead of $SOL. The goal is simple: push beyond Solana speeds while inheriting Bitcoin’s trust and brand power. Bitcoin Hyper currently relies on a single trusted sequencer. It batches transactions and anchors its state to the Bitcoin blockchain. This setup allows extremely low-latency confirmations, which works well for order-book DEXs, gaming loops, and NFT mints. Fees aim to stay at fractions of a cent, not the usual on-chain $BTC spikes. A decentralized canonical bridge moves $BTC into wrapped assets for fast swaps, payments, lending, and staking. The presale is already large. Bitcoin Hyper has raised over $28.9M and you can buy $HYPER now for just $0.013375. For Bitcoin holders and DeFi users, the pitch is straightforward. If institutional money continues to flow into $BTC due to macroeconomic risks, the next stage of the trade may manifest in the infrastructure that makes Bitcoin actually useful. Bitcoin Hyper wants to be that high-throughput SVM Layer 2 built for payments, gaming, and composable DeFi. Join the $HYPER presale now.
