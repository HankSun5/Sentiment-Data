55318055,639252,1764802853,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55318055.jpeg,Crypto Gains Strong Legal Protection in the UK as Lawmakers Finalize Digital Asset Property Rules,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-gains-strong-legal-protection-in-the-uk-as/,"The UK has reached a defining moment for its digital economy, introducing legal clarity that crypto users and businesses have long sought. For a long time, cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and other digital tokens existed in a grey legal zone, recognised by courts in practice but not formally defined in statute. That uncertainty shaped how disputes were settled, how assets were recovered, and how companies approached innovation. Now, with Parliament passing the Property (Digital Assets, etc.) Act and securing royal assent, the UK has made a deliberate shift toward a more structured digital asset framework. The new rules are designed to do more than refine legal language. It is believed that they will help how English law categorises emerging technologies, laying the groundwork for clearer ownership rights, smoother dispute resolution, and broader institutional participation. UK Issues Digital Assets Firm Legal Ownership Status The legislation confirms that digital or electronic “things” qualify as personal property, placing cryptocurrencies on the same legal footing as traditional assets. Previously, courts treated crypto as property through case-by-case rulings, relying on common law. Parliament’s decision now writes this position into statute, following a 2024 recommendation from the Law Commission. Digital assets had long challenged existing classifications. UK law traditionally recognised two forms of personal property: physical items (“things in possession”) and enforceable rights (“things in action”). Crypto fits neither category neatly. The new law resolves this by creating space for a distinct type of property that reflects how digital tokens behave and are used in modern markets. Industry groups welcomed the change, stating that it will help courts deal with theft, fraud, insolvency, and inheritance cases involving crypto with greater consistency. Users now have a clearer pathway for proving ownership and recovering lost or stolen digital funds. Stronger Protections as Adoption Rises The shift arrives as crypto participation continues to grow in the UK. According to financial regulators , around 12% of adults now hold some form of crypto, up from 10% in earlier findings. Policymakers have argued that this rising adoption makes legal certainty essential for both consumer protection and market stability. The new statute also aligns with the government’s broader plan for a regulated crypto regime that would bring exchanges and service providers under rules similar to those applied to traditional financial firms. Lawmakers aim to support innovation while introducing clear standards for accountability.

The former Ministry of Internal Affairs employee is believed to have accepted bribes worth $30 million and used them to buy various luxury assets. Russian prosecutors are seeking to seize property worth over 2.1 billion rubles from former Ministry of Internal Affairs official Georgy Satyukov, who allegedly accepted $184 million in Bitcoin and $30 million in Ethereum in bribes. How did a Russian police official become a millionaire? A former Ministry of Internal Affairs employee named Georgy Satyukov was identified by Russian prosecutors as the owner of various luxury assets, which Russian authorities believe were purchased with bribes from the operators of WEX crypto exchange. These luxury assets include 13 apartments in Russia, several commercial properties in St. Petersburg, and a villa in the UAE. Satyukov’s property holdings also include a $1 million property in the Russian city of Saratov registered in his brother’s name. Beyond real estate, investigators discovered two Porsche Cayenne Turbo cars registered in Satyukov’s name, all purchased after 2021, along with seven Patek Philippe watches, an ST Dupont Paris watch, and other jewelry valued at over $1.3 million. A search of Satyukov’s bank account revealed cash reserves of $540,000, as well as $38,500 in euros, and $14.2 million in Russian rubles held by him and his immediate family members. Satyukov began working at the ministry in 2001 and, between 2019 and 2021, headed a top-secret department codenamed “K” that specialized in investigating financial fraud cases and cybercrime. During his entire time as a Ministry of Internal Affairs employee, Satyukov’s salary would have added up to just $126,165. The Prosecutor General’s Office has filed a lawsuit demanding that movable and immovable property belonging to Satyukov, his relatives, and Dmitry Sokolov, Satyukov’s colleague at the Ministry of Internal Affairs, who is considered an intermediary in the bribery scheme, be transferred to state income. What was the WEX Exchange? Before its collapse, the WEX exchange was a popular platform that emerged in September 2017 as a successor to BTC-e. BTC-e was founded in July 2011 by Alexander Vinnik and Aleksandr Bilyuchenko, and as of February 2015, it handled around 3% of all Bitcoin exchange volume. However, the U.S. Justice Department shut the exchange down in July 2017 when it charged Vinnik with operating an alleged international money laundering scheme. The exchange was accused of facilitating criminal activities because it had no anti-money laundering or know-your-customer processes and collected virtually no customer data. WEX promised to compensate former BTC-e users for their losses, but in the summer of 2018, WEX clients’ wallets were suddenly frozen, and funds could only be removed at a 90% loss. Approximately $450 million in cryptocurrency vanished from the exchange. It was Alexey Ivanov, who pleaded guilty to embezzling 3.17 billion rubles from the cryptocurrency exchange, who pointed authorities to Satyukov after concluding a pre-trial cooperation agreement with the Prosecutor General’s Office. In exchange for his cooperation, Ivanov was released from criminal liability for paying bribes but received a three-year and six-month sentence for embezzling funds from the exchange’s clients. Satyukov was arrested in absentia and placed on an international wanted list. His alleged accomplice, Sokolov reportedly died in Mexico in July 2024, according to legal representatives. Both men are believed to have fled Russia to avoid prosecution. If convicted in the trial scheduled to begin December 8, their seized assets could be transferred to the Russian Treasury.

This favors a bullish XRP price prediction as institutional appetite seems to be rising. According to SoSo Value, the assets under management (AUM) held in these funds have surged to $844 million in just a couple of weeks, following the launch of multiple ETFs by Bitwise, Canary Capital, and Grayscale. On December 1, these vehicles attracted $89 million even though the market was experiencing a strong decline. In the past 24 hours, XRP has surged by 7% to $2.17 as the crypto market seems ready to make a comeback. Trading volumes have increased by 20% to nearly $5 billion, currently accounting for 4% of the token’s circulating market cap. XRP Price Prediction: 48% Gain Ahead If XRP Reverses Its Downtrend The daily chart shows that XRP is about to hit the upper bound of a descending price channel that has been forming since early October. If the price breaks out of this setup and climbs above its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), this would justify a bullish XRP price prediction. Source: TradingView The first target if that happens would be the $3.1 level, meaning a 48% upside potential based on where the price is trading today. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been forming a bullish divergence, as momentum has not made a lower low, even though the price has kept dropping. If positive ETF inflows continue, or accelerate, over the next few days, that should create a strong floor for XRP, and could result in an explosive move if bears are squeezed out of their positions. Meanwhile, as the market recovers, the best crypto presales of this year, like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , could outperform well-established tokens like XRP. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Will Pave the Way for a New Era of Bitcoin Applications BTC holders and developers have been restrained by the network’s slow speed and high transaction costs for years. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to change that by introducing the first real layer-2 chain for the top crypto using Solana’s technology. Through the Hyper Bridge, investors will be able to maintain their assets in a designated Bitcoin wallet and receive the corresponding amount on the Hyper L2 to access a suite of DeFi applications, payment platforms, and even launchpads for meme coins. Through these solutions, they will get the chance to stake their assets, earn yield, and more to generate passive income safely for the first time, all without leaving the Bitcoin OG blockchain. Analysts believe that as wallets and exchanges adopt Bitcoin Hyper, the demand for its native asset, $HYPER, is expected to increase rapidly. To buy $HYPER while it is still available at its presale price, simply head to the official Bitcoin Hyper website and link up a compatible wallet like Best Wallet .

This development could weigh heavily on Shiba Inu price prediction sentiment, as it highlights a critical weakness in the ecosystem’s infrastructure. The update came from developer Mitsuki Ryu Shimamoto, part of the K9 Finance team, who disclosed the details following a key breakthrough in the investigation.

Despite his efforts, analyst Shimamoto acknowledged it is unlikely that the hacker will “face justice”. Tracing the money will demand a significant effort from authorities, along with manpower and resources, that they may not be willing to invest. The whole incident revealed technical flaws in the design of an important piece of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Although prices are starting to show signs of recovery. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Positive Momentum Accelerates as SHIB Tags Key Trend Line Resistance SHIB has jumped 11% in the past 24 hours, signaling that momentum may finally be shifting in its favor. After Monday’s sharp dip, the broader market appears poised for a comeback, with SHIB leading the charge among top meme coins. While the token remains 58% down year-to-date, it is now approaching a key breakout point around $0.0000090. A decisive move above this level could open the door to a retest of $0.000010 and potentially set the stage for a full trend reversal. If this bullish setup plays out, SHIB could reclaim market attention as traders begin rotating back into high-upside assets. Meanwhile, new meme coins are stealing the spotlight this cycle. One of the most talked-about presales is Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , which has already raised over $4 million as early buyers rush in ahead of what could be a breakout debut. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Injects Meme Energy Into the Trading World Through a Fun Token Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is an Ethereum meme coin that embodies the hype that comes with bull markets. Its goal is to build a thriving community of like-minded ‘degens’ who know that their only way out of mom’s basement is through YOLO trades.

Traders will receive rewards and bragging rights for climbing the leaderboard by showcasing their ROIs. In addition, up to 25% of the presale’s proceeds will be used to invest in promising tokens with 1000X leverage, because YOLO. The gains will be used to pay for marketing campaigns that turn Maxi into a widely known meme coin.

Bitcoin has posted a 7% gain in the past 24 hours, with Ethereum up by 9%, Solana up by 12%, and Sui up by 26%. Sentiment is turning more positive after a bearish couple of months, with investors becoming increasingly optimistic that the Fed will cut rates when it meets next week. This has provided the optimal conditions for a big rally in December and January, and it won’t only be major tokens that will see significant returns. Newer coins could also outperform, which is why this article takes a closer look at upcoming ERC-20 crypto PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , our pick for the next altcoin to turn $100 into $10,000. Next Altcoin to Turn $100 into $10,000 – 3 December PEPENODE isn’t simply another Pepe-themed meme coin, but rather a utility token for an innovative mining platform. It removes the barriers that usually keep ordinary cryptocurrency investors from engaging in more traditional mining (e.g., Bitcoin mining), getting rid of the need to buy and operate expensive mining hardware. Whatever it takes to get the Node Upgrade. https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/oxKHfS1QBY — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) December 1, 2025 Instead, PEPENODE enables users to build, update, and run their own virtual mining rigs, which they can grow by spending PEPENODE tokens on new nodes. By buying more nodes and by upgrading and combining them in novel ways, users can earn more mining rewards. PEPENODE will pay out these rewards in external tokens, including Fartcoin and Pepe, with other popular coins coming after launch. This ability to earn via a virtual rig should invite considerable demand for PEPENODE, boosting its price considerably. Investors will also be able to earn by selling on their nodes when they no longer need them, and by staking PEPENODE, which currently provides a yield of 576% APY . These features could make PEPENODE a very profitable token to hold, especially if the market does enter a bull phase around its launch. PEPENODE Presale Raises $2.25 Million: How to Buy Early In order to buy PEPENODE early, before it lists and potentially surges, investors can go to the coin’s official website . They can connect a compatible wallet (such as Best Wallet) and then purchase whatever amount of the coin they would like, using ETH, USDT, BNB, or fiat to pay. The token is currently selling at $0.0011778, a price which will continue to rise until the presale comes to its end. Given its tokenomics and fundamentals, it could rise much higher once it launches, so interested parties should act sooner rather than later. It will have a max supply of 210 billion PEPENODE, with allocation spread between marketing, development, listings, node rewards, and its treasury. Judging by the popularity of its presale, which has now raised $2.25 million, it could have a very big 2026.

Each of these products offers direct exposure to XRP by holding the underlying asset and issuing shares that reflect its market value. All XRP ETF’s on Vanguard today! Choose your fighter.. https://t.co/MLhsgJPgkJ pic.twitter.com/FSx9MQzNU5 — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) December 2, 2025 In addition to spot exposure, Vanguard has also made leveraged XRP ETFs available. These include funds offering amplified daily returns as well as those structured around enhanced income strategies. Products issued by Volatility Shares, Teucrium, ProShares, and Amplify fall into this category, allowing investors to participate in XRP price movements at varying degrees of intensity without interacting with the token directly. Collectively, these offerings represent one of the broadest selections of XRP-linked ETFs available on any major U.S. brokerage platform. Rapid Growth in Cumulative Inflows Spot XRP ETFs have been drawing significant capital since the launch of the first U.S. product in mid-November. By December 1, combined inflows had reached approximately $756 million. Within the following day, this figure rose to about $824 million, reflecting a notable increase over a single trading session. The rise was driven by steady demand across the four active spot funds, all of which continued to attract new capital without recording any outflows. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market participants have pointed out that sustained inflows of this size could lead to a meaningful reduction in the supply of XRP available on public exchanges. Since spot ETF issuers must purchase XRP to support their shares, continued demand naturally leads to incremental accumulation. Community commentators, including Steingraber, argue that this dynamic may have long-term implications for liquidity, particularly if inflows remain consistent as more ETFs begin trading. Several new products are also approaching availability. The recently approved 21Shares XRP ETF, along with an upcoming fund from WisdomTree, is expected to join the lineup on Vanguard once final preparations are completed. Their introduction would broaden investor access further and may contribute to additional inflow momentum. Vanguard’s inclusion of a diverse range of XRP ETFs represents an important step toward deeper integration of digital assets within traditional investment channels. The combination of spot and leveraged products offers investors multiple approaches to gaining exposure, while the strong inflow patterns suggest growing institutional interest. As more ETFs join the platform and demand continues to rise, the role of XRP within regulated financial markets may expand considerably in the months ahead.

That makes it yet another pardon that has not been granted to Sam Bankman-Fried, who continues to be courting the President’s attention for clemency. On Polymarket , traders are pricing his pardon at a 2% chance, while traders from Kalshi only see a 4% chance that SBF is pardoned before the end of this year. The current level is proof that people think there is little chance he gets a pardon from the same man whose political rival he funded. SBF’s pardon odds. Source: Polymarket David Gentile will keep the cash he cheated people out of Trump has used the presidential clemency power, such as pardons and sentence commutations, on several high-profile cases, including the January 6 Capitol rioters, former Rep. George Santos, who pleaded guilty to felony wire fraud and identity theft charges, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao convicted of money laundering, and even reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were also convicted of financial crimes. Each pardon has raised eyebrows, but perhaps the one that has garnered the most reactions has been his commutation of Gentile’s sentence, even though the man had only served 12 days out of a seven-year prison sentence when he was released, according to the New York Times. It should be noted that what Gentile got was not a full pardon, which usually forgives the crime and restores rights; it was a commutation that shortens or ends the sentence but leaves the conviction intact. Of course, this specific commutation stands out because it also got rid of all remaining fines, restitution, and forfeiture obligations, which effectively means Gentile does not need to repay his victims or face any further financial penalties tied to the federal case. Gentile was the founder and CEO of GPB Capital, a company prosecutors say raised about $1.6 billion from investors based on misrepresented success of the private equity fund. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, while addressing the matter on December 1, implied that the case had been revisited because the Biden-era Justice Department that oversaw the prosecution mischaracterized it as a Ponzi scheme, and Gentile had concerns about false testimony. “In short, again this is another example that has been brought to the president’s attention of a weaponization of the justice of the previous administration,” she said, declining to answer questions about the victims in the case. According to records from the Bureau of Prisons, Gentile was released on November 26, the day before Thanksgiving. “I am also deeply grateful to see David Gentile heading home to his young children,” Trump’s “pardon czar” Alice Marie Johnson said on X . “These are miracles of mercy, and each one reminds us of the extraordinary power of second chances.” SBF renews hopes for a pardon Trump’s pardons have mostly been reserved for crypto-adjacent figures with lighter sentences and strong MAGA ties. SBF does not fit into either category with his billion-dollar fraud conviction and massive donation to support Biden. Still, SBF is not giving up hope. His parents, Stanford Law professors Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, have been doing their best to lobby Trump allies, including a lawyer from his 2016/2020 campaigns, as well as figures like Tucker Carlson, who conducted an interview with SBF in prison in March 2025. They’re framing the conviction as a “Democratic witch hunt,” in hopes that it will help paint a picture of him being targeted by the Biden administration, a move that worked well for the likes of David Gentile. SBF himself has also ramped up his social media activity, arguing FTX was solvent at collapse. In a recent post, he claimed that global FTX creditors could have benefited more if the lawyers had approved the exchange’s sales. There is also the fact that SBF shared a prison block with the former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who had been serving a 45-year sentence in the U.S. for drug trafficking and firearms offenses. When Trump pardoned Hernandez, calling it an act of “justice,” and claiming Hernández was “framed” by prosecutors, SBF reacted with enthusiasm, commenting via his X account, which is being run by a friend. “I’m so glad Juan Orlando is free—few are more deserving than him.” SBF described Hernández as “one of the kindest and most dedicated people I’ve met” and an “honor” to befriend, even “under the worst possible circumstances.” It was SBF’s second post praising a Trump pardon. Before that, he commented positively on the CZ commutation. Unfortunately, the convicted executive’s efforts have been insufficient in getting a look from President Trump, and bettors aren’t counting on it happening either.

Even in the post-halving bullish phase in its historical four-year cycle, it still trades 85% below its 2021 all-time high of $3.10. In a recent podcast , Hoskinson blamed this weak performance on the outsized influence of macroeconomic events on the crypto market. A headwind that is now clearing as the U.S. Fed makes a significant policy shift, ending quantitative tightening (QT) alongside a $13.5 billion liquidity boost for banks.

Despite persistent frustration within portions of the community due to forecasts that have not yet materialized, he maintains that targets as high as $33 remain achievable. His latest commentary combines technical reasoning with a broader message centered on discipline and endurance, urging investors to remain focused on long-term developments rather than short-term market swings. A Message Addressed to XRP Supporters Egrag’s recent update contained an unusually personal tone. He encouraged his audience to view the current phase of the market as a period that demands consistency and patience. He referenced teachings from major religious texts, including passages from the Bible, Torah, and Quran, as a way of underscoring the value of perseverance. He highlighted verses that speak to perseverance and testing, arguing that successful long-term investing requires similar qualities. According to him, remaining committed to an asset like XRP, despite repeated market setbacks, reflects both conviction and a willingness to endure uncertainty. #XRP – Green Ball and Then Blast ($17 – $27 – $33): Many of you send me DMs or leave comments asking, ""Aren't you tired of stating and showing different ways to reach these targets?""

In response, he emphasized that the conclusions he draws are based on observable data and historical behavior rather than sentiment. He stated that although enthusiasm within the community fluctuates, the foundation of his analysis remains consistent. Technical Basis for the Forecast The core of Egrag’s argument relies on patterns he identified in XRP’s multi-year price history. He focused particularly on the 2-week chart, where he observed that extended rallies often begin after the price returns to the 21-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA). This level, he noted, has repeatedly acted as an area where momentum begins to rebuild after prolonged consolidation. He drew attention to two previous examples . In 2017, XRP increased sharply after touching the 21 EMA, ultimately rising by more than twelvefold. A comparable pattern emerged in 2021, though the price increase was more moderate at roughly fivefold. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Using these two cases as reference points, he calculated an average potential gain of about 905% if XRP were to follow a similar trajectory again. Under this framework, he believes that values between $17 and $33 are reasonable outcomes for the next major upward move. Although earlier projections from Egrag have led to mixed reactions over the years, he asserted that the long-term chart continues to show constructive signals. He argued that market conditions often appear discouraging immediately before major shifts take place, making patience a crucial component of any investment strategy. Community Expectations and Market Sentiment Egrag cautioned that volatility is likely to persist and that emotional reactions from market participants can distort judgment. He stressed that his forecasts are based solely on technical indicators, emphasizing that market data remains consistent even when opinions differ. According to him, those who focus on long-term trends rather than short-term price fluctuations are more likely to benefit from future market cycles. Egrag’s renewed forecast underscores his belief that XRP’s long-term potential remains intact, provided investors maintain realistic expectations and a patient outlook. By combining historical price behavior with a message centered on discipline, he argues that the path to higher valuations remains possible even if the timeline is uncertain. As market sentiment shifts repeatedly, he continues to advise the XRP community to remain calm, focused, and committed to the broader trend rather than immediate price movements.

55319695,639159,1764806420,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55319695.jpeg,Vanguard’s Policy Reversal Triggers Sharp Bitcoin Rally as $11T Giant Enters Crypto,https://bitcoinist.com/vanguards-policy-reversal-triggers-bitcoin-rally/,"A new CryptoQuant report from XWIN Research Japan reveals that the sharp +6% Bitcoin rally on December 2–3, 2025 was triggered by a seismic shift in traditional finance: Vanguard’s unexpected policy reversal. The $11 trillion asset manager—long known for its conservative stance—opened its platform to spot ETFs for BTC, ETH, XRP, and SOL, instantly giving more than 50 million investors access to crypto products. The move marks one of the most significant steps toward mainstream adoption in the industry’s history. The catalyst behind this reversal was the appointment of Salim Ramji, Vanguard’s new CEO and a former BlackRock executive who played a key role in launching the IBIT ETF. His leadership signaled a dramatic change in direction, and the market responded immediately. Once US markets opened, Bitcoin surged 6% in a single move, while IBIT surpassed $1 billion in trading volume within the first 30 minutes. Massive inflows from retail and retirement accounts followed, with Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas noting that “a large wave of Vanguard clients may have moved all at once.” Institutional Demand Builds as Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Recovers XWIN Research Japan notes that, despite the recent surge, the Coinbase Premium Index remains in negative territory, showing that US prices still sit slightly below global averages. Even so, the report highlights a clear improvement in US spot buying pressure, signaling that demand is slowly returning. If the premium rises back to zero or positive territory, the market may begin to price in what XWIN calls the “next wave” — a phase that could propel Bitcoin toward the $100K range as institutional flows strengthen. This shift is happening just as Vanguard makes its historic entrance into the crypto market. XWIN emphasizes that this is not a short-term catalyst. Vanguard manages $11 trillion, and even a tiny allocation — just 0.5% of assets flowing into crypto ETFs — would represent $55 billion in new capital. That figure alone exceeds the entire first-year inflow from the 2024 spot Bitcoin ETF cycle. With the “final giant” of traditional finance now participating, the long-term structure of Bitcoin demand is changing. Vanguard’s move signals the beginning of a genuine institutional adoption phase, where inflows can scale far beyond anything seen in previous cycles, potentially redefining Bitcoin’s upper price boundaries. Price Rebounds From Weekly Support but Faces Major Resistance Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows a strong rebound from the $84,000–$86,000 support zone, an area that aligns closely with the 100-week SMA. This level acted as a critical pivot during previous corrections, and once again buyers stepped in aggressively, forming a clear bullish reaction. The long lower wick from last week’s candle confirms strong demand, with BTC now trading back above $93,000. However, despite the rebound, the broader structure remains cautious. Bitcoin still trades below the 50-week SMA, which has begun to flatten near the $102,000–$103,000 region. This moving average now acts as a major resistance level and the next key test for bulls. A weekly close above it would mark a meaningful shift in momentum and signal that BTC may be ready to resume its broader uptrend. If BTC continues to hold above the 100-week SMA and pushes toward the 50-week SMA, the market could enter a consolidation phase that sets the stage for a stronger upside move.

XRP Price Consolidation Nears Its End On the higher-timeframe 2-day chart, Osemka frames the structure as a classic flat correction built on top of the 2021 high. “Here’s the range and levels to help you navigate it. We’re basing on top of 2021 high,” he writes, adding that “we’ve also never broken down after going sideways for this long, so I remain with my view of this being an accumulation range and a flat correction.” Related Reading: XRP Whale Wallets Collapse 20%, But Biggest Holders Hoard More Than Ever His chart shows XRP oscillating in a horizontal band whose floor aligns with the 2021 high, labeled as a “Reaccumulation” area. Price has repeatedly tagged this support and bounced, while midrange resistance in the low-to-mid $2 zone has capped multiple rallies. Above, a higher horizontal line marks the January spike, which Osemka treats as the cycle top. Internally, he maps an A–B–C corrective sequence. The B leg forms a dotted ascending channel, labeled as a 3-legged “abc” wave. “That dotted ascending range in the middle (3 legged abc wave in B) has me optimistic as that is a corrective move that is synonymous for a flat correction,” he explains. “Meaning the top was in January and this indeed is only a sideways correction.” The current C leg is contained within a downward “Corrective channel” pointing back toward the lower band. For Osemka, even a deeper test of support would not necessarily be bearish for the larger structure: “If we end up taking the lower end of the range with C leg it’ll remain to be seen. But if so, it’d be a great buying opportunity.” He also calls XRP “a perfect example on why I view BTC also as a flat correction with the top in January,” arguing that “while Bitcoin is messy, XRP is very clean.” Why Its Now Or Never For XRP Dom zooms in on the last six weeks of that broader range and focuses on the microstructure that could trigger a move back toward the upper band. “If you inverse the chart over the last 6 weeks, you’ll see a perfect 3 drive pattern, a very accurate reversal setup in crypto,” he writes. On the non-inverted chart, this corresponds to three downside pushes that fail to extend lower, followed by what he calls a higher low: “We can see a HL has finally formed which can hint at the first sign of a trend change developing.” His 8-hour chart highlights the monthly rolling VWAP as the key pivot. “Bulls needs to regain the monthly rVWAP around $2.22 and that would be the shift for a rally back towards ~$2.50,” Dom says. That ~$2.50 area aligns with higher VWAP clusters and the upper portion of Osemka’s range. Related Reading: XRP Price About $1,000 Is A Necessity, Analyst Claims Order-book and skew data back his view that conditions are ripe for a break if buyers step in. “Orderbooks are clear, if there was a time, it’s now for this trend to shift,” he notes, pointing to relatively clean liquidity overhead and a recovering skew after a washed-out short side. The downside is equally explicit: “If this setup fails, acceptance under $2 is next and the end of year is ugly.” That would mean a decisive loss of the long-defended support band built on the 2021 high and a deeper completion of the C leg in Osemka’s flat-correction structure. For now, XRP remains compressed between the $2.00 support, the $2.22 monthly rVWAP trigger and the ~$2.50 upside magnet, with the six-week 3-drive pattern and flat-correction range jointly defining one of the clearest technical inflection points on the XRP chart this year. At press time, XRP traded at $2.1798.

Price dropped toward the True Market Mean, the cost basis of all active coins minus miners, and then held there. According to Glassnode, that level splits light bear phases from deep bear markets. For now, price is sitting just above it. The structure around it now matches what showed up in Q1 2022 almost tick for tick. Spot price moved under the 0.75 supply quantile in mid‑November and now trades near $96.1K, putting more than 25% of total supply underwater. At the same time, sellers may already be worn out. The line that changes everything is still the 0.85 quantile near $106.2K. Until price takes that level back, macro shocks keep full control of direction. Glassnode data shows that Bitcoin’s Net Change in Realized Cap reads +$8.69B per month, which is pretty weak compared to the $64.3B per month peak in July, but it is not exactly negative either. As long as this stays above zero, price can still build a base instead of falling apart. Meanwhile, long‑term investors continue to sell into strength, but at shrinking margins, with the Long‑Term Holder SOPR (30D‑SMA) stands at 1.43. Derivatives and options reset risk across the board Spot demand now looks lighter. U.S. Bitcoin ETFs flipped into net outflows across November on a three‑day average basis. The steady inflow that supported price earlier this year is gone. Outflows hit many issuers at once. Institutions pulled back as market pressure built. That leaves price more exposed to outside shocks. At the same time, Cumulative Volume Delta turned negative on Binance and across the aggregate exchange group. That signals steady taker selling. Coinbase flattened as well. That removed a key sign of U.S. bid strength. With ETF flows and CVD both defensive, spot demand now runs thin. Derivatives followed the same path. Futures open interest kept falling through late November. The unwind stayed slow and orderly. The leverage built during the uptrend is now mostly gone. New leverage is not entering. Funding rates cooled near zero after months of positive prints. Modest negative funding showed up at times but never lasted long. Shorts are not pressing hard. Positioning now sits neutral and flat. In options, implied volatility dropped after last week’s spike. Bitcoin failed to hold above $92K, and sellers stepped back in, so short‑dated volatility fell from 57% to 48%, mid‑tenor slid from 52% to 45%, and long‑dated eased from 49% to 47%. Short‑term skew fell from 18.6% to 8.4% after Bitcoin’s price rebounded from $84.5K, a drop tied to the Japanese bond shock. Longer maturities moved slower. Traders chased short‑term upside but stayed unsure about follow‑through. Early week flow leaned heavy on put buying tied to fears of a repeat of the August 2024 carry‑trade stress. Once price stabilized, flow flipped to calls during the rebound. At the $100K call strike, call premium sold still exceeds call premium bought, and the gap widened during the past 48 hours. That shows weak conviction to reclaim six figures. Traders also sit ahead of the FOMC meeting without chasing upside.

Leverage rises with long/short ratios above 2.2 on major venues, amplifying liquidation risks. Spot outflows slow, with a modest $620K inflow marking the first positive reading in weeks. By Parshwa Turakhiya Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) is attempting to stabilize after a two-month slide that pushed the token to a low near $0.13, marking one of its deepest drawdowns of the year. The recovery toward $0.15 reflects tentative dip-buying interest, but the broader structure remains defined by a persistent downtrend channel and a market still unwinding excess leverage. DOGE has not collapsed, yet the burden of proof has shifted firmly onto buyers. The daily chart continues to show DOGE respecting a clean descending channel, with overhead resistance between $0.158 and $0.165, where the mid-channel boundary intersects the 20-day EMA. A rejection here would keep downward momentum intact and risk a retest of the lower channel line near $0.125, a level that has repeatedly acted as a liquidity floor. DOGE price analysis (Source: TradingView) The more decisive battleground sits higher, between $0.171 and $0.18. This zone aligns with the 50-day EMA and a horizontal shelf that capped price action throughout early Q4. Until DOGE clears that area, rallies remain corrective rather than structural. Yet the long-term accumulation base stretching back to March continues to hold. As long as the price stays above $0.128–$0.13, Dogecoin avoids structural damage and maintains the slow-build accumulation narrative that has underpinned its broader cycle. A breakdown below that floor would shift the market toward deeper support at $0.105–$0.11, an area known for abrupt and volatile reversals when liquidity thins and shorts overextend. Momentum indicators reflect this transitional phase. RSI sits near 45, rising from oversold territory but not yet signaling trend reversal. Historically, DOGE requires a breakout of the 55–60 RSI band to trigger sustained upside, a threshold the market has yet to approach. Flows and positioning reveal a market repairing, not rallying Spot flows show a market that has shed considerable risk. Repeated $40–100 million net outflows through September and October underscored investor reluctance to commit capital. The most recent print, however, shows a $620,000 inflow, the first positive reading in weeks. While small, it indicates the bleeding has slowed and sellers are no longer dominating every bounce. The derivatives market tells a more complicated story. Open interest has risen 8.6 percent to $1.5 billion, with volume jumping 42 percent. Long/short ratios above 2.2 on major venues point to a heavily long-biased market, meaning the current bounce is driven by leverage rather than organic spot demand. If DOGE fails to break resistance, these leveraged longs risk liquidation cascades that could accelerate downside entirely through mechanical unwinds. This dynamic is not unfamiliar. The last time DOGE saw rising open interest during a downtrend, the market was setting up for a washout that ultimately produced the late-Q1 rally. Rising leverage into weakness is historically fragile. A controlled squeeze lower could clear positioning and reset conditions for a healthier upside attempt - an outcome paradoxically favorable for medium-term bulls. The short-term roadmap remains binary. A reclaim of $0.171–$0.18 would break the downtrend and open room toward $0.20–$0.21, where the 200-day EMA sits and where prior rallies failed. Conversely, a drop below $0.138–$0.14 would expose DOGE to a liquidity flush toward $0.115, a level where mean-reversion traders historically step in aggressively. A market digesting, not collapsing The deeper narrative surrounding DOGE is one of digestion rather than deterioration. The token is shedding speculative leverage accumulated earlier in the year while attempting to stabilize above long-term support. Spot selling has slowed, derivatives positioning is stretched but active, and sentiment remains hesitant but not despairing. DOGE is now balanced between two competing forces: cheap enough to interest value-focused buyers, but not strong enough to force shorts to unwind. The next test of resistance will determine whether this bounce becomes a trend or fades into another liquidity event in a market still detoxing from its last cycle. In earlier coverage, we noted that Dogecoin’s structure had entered a slow-grind corrective phase rather than a collapse, with long-term support levels showing resilience even as leverage unwound. The current price behavior aligns with that view. DOGE is still repairing, not reversing, and the key catalysts ahead remain its ability to reclaim EMAs and reverse the descending channel that has defined sentiment since early Q4.

According to reports from Bloomberg and the Financial Times, drones sweep across rooftops, scanning for strange heat signals inside abandoned houses, vacant shops, and other dead zones. These hot spots almost always point to rigs running nonstop. On the ground, police walk with handheld sensors that pick up unusual electricity use. Citizens allegedly report birds chirping all night, but it’s just fake sounds playing on speakers to cover the roar of mining machines behind locked doors. Miners move quickly. They set up in one place, install heat shields to hide their equipment, mount CCTV cameras, and wire their entrances with broken glass. Then they vanish before authorities arrive. Over the last five years, officers have tracked down 14,000 illegal sites linked to power theft.That’s what the Energy Ministry said in the latest breakdown.The damage to Tenaga Nasional, Malaysia’s state-owned utility, has hit around $1.1 billion and counting. By October, 3,000 new cases had already been logged just this year as Bitcoin’s price went up, crashed over 30 percent, and started rising again. Taskforce forms to chase down mining operators On November 19, Malaysia launched a new taskforce made up of the Ministry of Finance, Bank Negara Malaysia, and TNB. Akmal Nasrullah Mohd Nasir, who serves as deputy minister of energy transition and water transformation, is in charge of the team. “You can actually even break our facilities. It becomes a challenge to our system,” Akmal said on Wednesday. The rigs that miners use run around the clock, blasting out trillions of guesses every second. That’s how they validate transactions and get rewarded in Bitcoin. It’s a race. The more guesses you make, the better your odds. But it also burns massive amounts of electricity. One group turned ElementX Mall, a half-dead shopping center overlooking the Strait of Malacca, into a full-on crypto farm. The mall shut down during the pandemic and never bounced back. Floors are still unfinished. Wires hang from the ceiling. In early 2022, Bitcoin rigs filled the space. By 2025, they were gone. A TikTok video made the whole thing public. A report from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance said over 75 percent of mining now happens in the United States. Malaysia used to hold 2.5 percent of global hashrate in January 2022, but Chainalysis hasn’t released a report/data on that since then. Miners occupy failed malls, logging sites across country Another outfit called Bityou took over a former logging yard in Sarawak. Under Malaysian law, Bitcoin mining is legal. But only if you get your power legally and pay your taxes. Akmal isn’t buying it. He’s joined raids before. He’s seen how these groups operate. When the taskforce held its first meeting on November 25, some members pushed to outlaw mining altogether. “Even if you run it properly, the challenge is that the market itself is very volatile,” Akmal said . “I don’t see any well-run mining that can be considered as successful legally.” He also thinks the way these operations move around shows signs of organized crime. “It’s clearly run by the syndicate, because of how mobile they are from setting up in one place to another place,” Akmal said. “It does have modus operandi.” Get seen where it counts.

CryptoQuant reports that the company’s monthly purchases decreased from 134,000 BTC at the 2024 peak to just 9,100 BTC in November 2025, with only 135 BTC so far this month. According to the data analytics firm, the 24-month buffer is a clear indication that Strategy is bracing for the bear market. On November 17th, Strategy acquired 8,178 BTC for approximately $835.5 million, its largest purchase since July, bringing its total holdings to 649,870 BTC, valued at approximately $58.7 billion at the time of writing. The firm has been the subject of intense speculation over the last several months following a downturn in the crypto market and the unwinding of the BTC proxy trade , which included digital asset treasury companies that accumulate crypto and mining operations. Strategy secures $1.4B cash reserve Just a few weeks ago, Strategy CEO Phong Le said the company might sell some of its Bitcoin to cover debt costs , but only if its stock falls below net asset value (NAV) or if it loses access to financing. The company has also set aside a $1.4 billion cash reserve to cover dividend payments and debt obligations. This reserve is expected to provide a 12-month runway, with plans to expand it to cover 24 months, the company added. Strategy’s attempt to join major stock market indexes has faced obstacles.MSCI, which sets eligibility criteria for many of these indexes, has suggested a policy change that would bar treasury companies holding 50% or more of their balance-sheet assets in digital assets. The directive would cut off firms like Strategy from the passive inflows that come with index inclusion. Michael Saylor, the co-founder of Strategy, recently stated that Strategy is engaging with MSCI regarding the proposed policy change, which is set to take effect in January. Bitcoin bounces to align with industry cost benchmarks Bitcoin is closely monitored with the Difficulty Regression Model, according t o checkonchai n . This model estimates the all-in sustaining production cost for the network. The model treats mining difficulty as a distilled measure of mining price, as it incorporates all major operational variables into a single figure. This provides a n industry-wide estimate of the average cost to produce one Bitcoin, eliminating the need for detailed assumptions about hardware, energ y expens es, or logistics. This model is currently priced at approximately $92,300, roughly the same as Bitcoin’s spot price. Bitcoin tumbled briefly to around $80,000 but has since come back to the model. When Bitcoin moves above the model, then it tends to signal a bull market; when its price moves beneath it, it often indicates a bear market. In April 2025, Bitcoin dropped to $76,000, but was supported at the model’s value. Bitcoin was traded roughly 50% above the model for the majority of 2025; in 2024, however, prices stayed closer to it. Bitcoin was quoted as much as 50% below the model during the 2022 bear market. In previous bull markets, it has soared far above the model — doubling its price at the 2021 peak and five times the model’s value in 2017. As Bitcoin matures into an asset, premiums near those levels seem a thing of the past. Overall, the model suggests Bitcoin is currently priced near its production cost, which can be interpreted as a fair value zone . Metcalfe’s bas ed valuations also place bitcoin near fair value around $90,000, reinforcing that assessment.

RSI near 66 signals strong but cooling momentum. On chain flows turn mildly positive after prolonged weakness. By Ashutosh Sureka Uniswap ( UNI-USD ) is trading at $6.07, up 10.7% in the past 24 hours, extending its rebound after a sharp recovery from the mid-$5.40 zone. The market cap stands at $3.82 billion, while daily trading volume at $498.52 million reflects heavy participation as buyers returned aggressively after yesterday’s capitulation drop. The day’s range between $5.39 and $6.17 highlights strong intraday volatility as UNI stabilizes above a key short-term resistance band. Uniswap price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Technical structure analysis UNI remains below major EMAs on higher timeframes, but short-term structure shows clear improvement. The 20 EMA sits near $5.87, the 50 EMA near $5.93, the 100 EMA around $6.02, and the 200 EMA close to $6.03. Price has reclaimed the faster EMAs and is now pressing directly into the heavier 100 and 200 EMAs, signalling early trend repair though not yet a confirmed breakout. RSI on the 1-hour chart sits near 66.63 after an earlier spike toward 79.06, showing strong momentum that has cooled but remains constructive. UNI needs a decisive break above $6.20 for continuation, while slipping below $5.85 risks reopening downside toward last week’s lows. On-chain flows analysis On-chain flows have turned mildly positive after weeks of persistent red prints. Coinglass data shows a net inflow of about $762.17k on 3 December, marking one of the strongest green spikes in recent sessions. This follows a long period of heavy outflows throughout October and November, during which market cap compression mirrored retreating sentiment. The latest stabilization in market cap suggests selective rotation back into DeFi despite overall caution. Sentiment and fundamentals UNI’s broader tone has improved as DeFi assets staged a sector-wide rebound. Liquidity remains thin, but whale accumulation has supported the recovery. However, strong overhead supply between $6.15 and $6.30 continues to cap momentum. Protocol-level developments have not yet sparked a major shift in behaviour, meaning sustained progress still depends on broader market tone and improved flow dynamics. Short-term outlook UNI has shown a strong intraday recovery with early signs of stabilization. Holding above $5.85 keeps the constructive structure intact, while clearing $6.20 is required to confirm a deeper push higher. Without this breakout, UNI remains vulnerable to pullbacks if broader sentiment weakens. In earlier analysis, UNI was trading near $5.48 with persistent outflows, heavy EMA resistance overhead, and weak momentum near oversold territory. Today’s rebound marks the first meaningful structural improvement since that decline, but confirmation still requires reclaiming the $6.20 level.

Related Reading: Crypto Investors Brace As Japan Proposes 20% Tax By 2027 The move follows a month-long slide that erased nearly 20% from recent highs and raised questions about whether the broader uptrend was losing strength. Consequently, about $250 million in BTC short positions have been liquidated. Institutional Access Expands as Vanguard Lifts ETF Ban The most notable catalyst for the rebound came from Vanguard, which reversed its long-standing ban on Bitcoin ETFs . The decision immediately opened access to tens of millions of retail accounts and allowed products such as BlackRock’s IBIT to trade on the platform, generating more than $1 billion in volume on day one. The policy shift triggered a rapid surge in demand and helped fuel more than $400 million in short liquidations as Bitcoin jumped from the mid-$88,000 area to above $93,000 within hours. Analysts note that several major firms, including Robinhood and Fidelity, added significant BTC exposure during the session. Combined with stablecoin issuers expanding supply in recent weeks, liquidity across the crypto market has broadened. Macro Shifts and Technical Levels Support the Recovery The rebound coincided with the U.S. Federal Reserve ending its quantitative tightening programme and injecting fresh funds into short-term markets. Repo facility usage also increased, improving liquidity for risk assets. Traders now assign high probability to a rate cut at the Fed’s December meeting. Across the market , major assets followed Bitcoin higher. Ethereum traded near $3,000, Solana reached $142, and XRP climbed back above $2.18. Market indexes tracking large-cap cryptocurrencies rose around 7%, while the Crypto Fear & Greed Index moved off extreme fear levels. Technical indicators are showing early signs of stabilisation. Analysts highlight the $86,000–$88,000 range as a key support zone that has held through repeated tests in recent months. Bitcoin is also pressing against resistance between $92,500 and $94,000, forming an ascending triangle pattern. Renewed $100K Bitcoin Targets, but Debate Over Trend Strength Remains Despite the strong bounce, analysts remain divided on whether Bitcoin is entering a renewed expansion phase or simply retracing after a sharp correction. Some warn that deeper downtrends historically unfold over longer periods. Others argue that rising institutional participation and on-chain activity resemble previous mid-cycle resets rather than the start of a prolonged decline.

Related Reading: XRP Is About To Hit A Major Turning Point This Week, Analyst Says The well-known investor/entrepreneur said he is not investing as if the Fed will ease policy, and he thinks Bitcoin will likely drift within 5% of its current level. Fed Cut Odds Skyrocketing According to the CME FedWatch Tool, markets are now pricing in an 89% chance of a December rate cut, a big swing from just weeks earlier when odds were far lower. This shift in expectations has been a main driver of recent moves in risk assets, including crypto. LATEST 🚨 Kevin O’Leary just said a December Fed rate cut is unlikely because inflation is still too high! He also said “It’s not going to make a difference to Bitcoin.” Do you agree? 🤔 pic.twitter.com/lJBrW4Z2kA — That Martini Guy ₿ (@MartiniGuyYT) December 3, 2025 Bitcoin Reacts To Shift In Sentiment Based on reports from market trackers, Bitcoin climbed after a recent dip, recovering from a low near $83,000 to trade around $93,700 in early trading sessions. Coingecko listed the price roughly in the $92,700–$92,800 band during morning trade. Traders point to support at $90,000 and resistance near $92,500, and some desk notes say a clean break above that could open a run toward $94K–$95K. Why O’Leary Is Skeptical O’Leary has flagged higher prices in the economy and sticky input costs as reasons the Fed might hold off. Reports show US consumer prices rose at a 3% annual rate in September, the fastest since January, a datapoint he cited to argue inflation still matters. The inflation numbers are being watched closely by policymakers weighing the trade-off between jobs and prices. Liquidity Moves Add Fuel Reports have disclosed that the Fed quietly put more than $13 billion of liquidity into short-term funding, a move some analysts say has helped restore liquidity in money markets and supported risk assets. That liquidity boost, together with the pause in Quantitative Tightening, has been flagged by quant desks as one reason bullish momentum returned to crypto. Market Reaction O’Leary’s take is at odds with the market odds and with several analysts who see easier monetary policy as a tailwind for assets like Bitcoin. He is not alone in warning against reading too much into a single Fed decision, but many traders have already positioned for easing and that positioning has moved prices.
