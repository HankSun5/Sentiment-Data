55318055,639252,1764802853,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55318055.jpeg,Crypto Gains Strong Legal Protection in the UK as Lawmakers Finalize Digital Asset Property Rules,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-gains-strong-legal-protection-in-the-uk-as/,"The UK has reached a defining moment for its digital economy, introducing legal clarity that crypto users and businesses have long sought. For a long time, cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and other digital tokens existed in a grey legal zone, recognised by courts in practice but not formally defined in statute. That uncertainty shaped how disputes were settled, how assets were recovered, and how companies approached innovation. Now, with Parliament passing the Property (Digital Assets, etc.) Act and securing royal assent, the UK has made a deliberate shift toward a more structured digital asset framework. The new rules are designed to do more than refine legal language. It is believed that they will help how English law categorises emerging technologies, laying the groundwork for clearer ownership rights, smoother dispute resolution, and broader institutional participation. UK Issues Digital Assets Firm Legal Ownership Status The legislation confirms that digital or electronic “things” qualify as personal property, placing cryptocurrencies on the same legal footing as traditional assets. Previously, courts treated crypto as property through case-by-case rulings, relying on common law. Parliament’s decision now writes this position into statute, following a 2024 recommendation from the Law Commission. Digital assets had long challenged existing classifications. UK law traditionally recognised two forms of personal property: physical items (“things in possession”) and enforceable rights (“things in action”). Crypto fits neither category neatly. The new law resolves this by creating space for a distinct type of property that reflects how digital tokens behave and are used in modern markets. Industry groups welcomed the change, stating that it will help courts deal with theft, fraud, insolvency, and inheritance cases involving crypto with greater consistency. Users now have a clearer pathway for proving ownership and recovering lost or stolen digital funds. Stronger Protections as Adoption Rises The shift arrives as crypto participation continues to grow in the UK. According to financial regulators , around 12% of adults now hold some form of crypto, up from 10% in earlier findings. Policymakers have argued that this rising adoption makes legal certainty essential for both consumer protection and market stability. The new statute also aligns with the government’s broader plan for a regulated crypto regime that would bring exchanges and service providers under rules similar to those applied to traditional financial firms. Lawmakers aim to support innovation while introducing clear standards for accountability.

The former Ministry of Internal Affairs employee is believed to have accepted bribes worth $30 million and used them to buy various luxury assets. Russian prosecutors are seeking to seize property worth over 2.1 billion rubles from former Ministry of Internal Affairs official Georgy Satyukov, who allegedly accepted $184 million in Bitcoin and $30 million in Ethereum in bribes. How did a Russian police official become a millionaire? A former Ministry of Internal Affairs employee named Georgy Satyukov was identified by Russian prosecutors as the owner of various luxury assets, which Russian authorities believe were purchased with bribes from the operators of WEX crypto exchange. These luxury assets include 13 apartments in Russia, several commercial properties in St. Petersburg, and a villa in the UAE. Satyukov’s property holdings also include a $1 million property in the Russian city of Saratov registered in his brother’s name. Beyond real estate, investigators discovered two Porsche Cayenne Turbo cars registered in Satyukov’s name, all purchased after 2021, along with seven Patek Philippe watches, an ST Dupont Paris watch, and other jewelry valued at over $1.3 million. A search of Satyukov’s bank account revealed cash reserves of $540,000, as well as $38,500 in euros, and $14.2 million in Russian rubles held by him and his immediate family members. Satyukov began working at the ministry in 2001 and, between 2019 and 2021, headed a top-secret department codenamed “K” that specialized in investigating financial fraud cases and cybercrime. During his entire time as a Ministry of Internal Affairs employee, Satyukov’s salary would have added up to just $126,165. The Prosecutor General’s Office has filed a lawsuit demanding that movable and immovable property belonging to Satyukov, his relatives, and Dmitry Sokolov, Satyukov’s colleague at the Ministry of Internal Affairs, who is considered an intermediary in the bribery scheme, be transferred to state income. What was the WEX Exchange? Before its collapse, the WEX exchange was a popular platform that emerged in September 2017 as a successor to BTC-e. BTC-e was founded in July 2011 by Alexander Vinnik and Aleksandr Bilyuchenko, and as of February 2015, it handled around 3% of all Bitcoin exchange volume. However, the U.S. Justice Department shut the exchange down in July 2017 when it charged Vinnik with operating an alleged international money laundering scheme. The exchange was accused of facilitating criminal activities because it had no anti-money laundering or know-your-customer processes and collected virtually no customer data. WEX promised to compensate former BTC-e users for their losses, but in the summer of 2018, WEX clients’ wallets were suddenly frozen, and funds could only be removed at a 90% loss. Approximately $450 million in cryptocurrency vanished from the exchange. It was Alexey Ivanov, who pleaded guilty to embezzling 3.17 billion rubles from the cryptocurrency exchange, who pointed authorities to Satyukov after concluding a pre-trial cooperation agreement with the Prosecutor General’s Office. In exchange for his cooperation, Ivanov was released from criminal liability for paying bribes but received a three-year and six-month sentence for embezzling funds from the exchange’s clients. Satyukov was arrested in absentia and placed on an international wanted list. His alleged accomplice, Sokolov reportedly died in Mexico in July 2024, according to legal representatives. Both men are believed to have fled Russia to avoid prosecution. If convicted in the trial scheduled to begin December 8, their seized assets could be transferred to the Russian Treasury.

This favors a bullish XRP price prediction as institutional appetite seems to be rising. According to SoSo Value, the assets under management (AUM) held in these funds have surged to $844 million in just a couple of weeks, following the launch of multiple ETFs by Bitwise, Canary Capital, and Grayscale. On December 1, these vehicles attracted $89 million even though the market was experiencing a strong decline. In the past 24 hours, XRP has surged by 7% to $2.17 as the crypto market seems ready to make a comeback. Trading volumes have increased by 20% to nearly $5 billion, currently accounting for 4% of the token’s circulating market cap. XRP Price Prediction: 48% Gain Ahead If XRP Reverses Its Downtrend The daily chart shows that XRP is about to hit the upper bound of a descending price channel that has been forming since early October. If the price breaks out of this setup and climbs above its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), this would justify a bullish XRP price prediction. Source: TradingView The first target if that happens would be the $3.1 level, meaning a 48% upside potential based on where the price is trading today. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been forming a bullish divergence, as momentum has not made a lower low, even though the price has kept dropping. If positive ETF inflows continue, or accelerate, over the next few days, that should create a strong floor for XRP, and could result in an explosive move if bears are squeezed out of their positions. Meanwhile, as the market recovers, the best crypto presales of this year, like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , could outperform well-established tokens like XRP. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Will Pave the Way for a New Era of Bitcoin Applications BTC holders and developers have been restrained by the network’s slow speed and high transaction costs for years. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to change that by introducing the first real layer-2 chain for the top crypto using Solana’s technology. Through the Hyper Bridge, investors will be able to maintain their assets in a designated Bitcoin wallet and receive the corresponding amount on the Hyper L2 to access a suite of DeFi applications, payment platforms, and even launchpads for meme coins. Through these solutions, they will get the chance to stake their assets, earn yield, and more to generate passive income safely for the first time, all without leaving the Bitcoin OG blockchain. Analysts believe that as wallets and exchanges adopt Bitcoin Hyper, the demand for its native asset, $HYPER, is expected to increase rapidly. To buy $HYPER while it is still available at its presale price, simply head to the official Bitcoin Hyper website and link up a compatible wallet like Best Wallet .

This development could weigh heavily on Shiba Inu price prediction sentiment, as it highlights a critical weakness in the ecosystem’s infrastructure. The update came from developer Mitsuki Ryu Shimamoto, part of the K9 Finance team, who disclosed the details following a key breakthrough in the investigation.

Despite his efforts, analyst Shimamoto acknowledged it is unlikely that the hacker will “face justice”. Tracing the money will demand a significant effort from authorities, along with manpower and resources, that they may not be willing to invest. The whole incident revealed technical flaws in the design of an important piece of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Although prices are starting to show signs of recovery. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Positive Momentum Accelerates as SHIB Tags Key Trend Line Resistance SHIB has jumped 11% in the past 24 hours, signaling that momentum may finally be shifting in its favor. After Monday’s sharp dip, the broader market appears poised for a comeback, with SHIB leading the charge among top meme coins. While the token remains 58% down year-to-date, it is now approaching a key breakout point around $0.0000090. A decisive move above this level could open the door to a retest of $0.000010 and potentially set the stage for a full trend reversal. If this bullish setup plays out, SHIB could reclaim market attention as traders begin rotating back into high-upside assets. Meanwhile, new meme coins are stealing the spotlight this cycle. One of the most talked-about presales is Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , which has already raised over $4 million as early buyers rush in ahead of what could be a breakout debut. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Injects Meme Energy Into the Trading World Through a Fun Token Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is an Ethereum meme coin that embodies the hype that comes with bull markets. Its goal is to build a thriving community of like-minded ‘degens’ who know that their only way out of mom’s basement is through YOLO trades.

Traders will receive rewards and bragging rights for climbing the leaderboard by showcasing their ROIs. In addition, up to 25% of the presale’s proceeds will be used to invest in promising tokens with 1000X leverage, because YOLO. The gains will be used to pay for marketing campaigns that turn Maxi into a widely known meme coin.

Bitcoin has posted a 7% gain in the past 24 hours, with Ethereum up by 9%, Solana up by 12%, and Sui up by 26%. Sentiment is turning more positive after a bearish couple of months, with investors becoming increasingly optimistic that the Fed will cut rates when it meets next week. This has provided the optimal conditions for a big rally in December and January, and it won’t only be major tokens that will see significant returns. Newer coins could also outperform, which is why this article takes a closer look at upcoming ERC-20 crypto PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , our pick for the next altcoin to turn $100 into $10,000. Next Altcoin to Turn $100 into $10,000 – 3 December PEPENODE isn’t simply another Pepe-themed meme coin, but rather a utility token for an innovative mining platform. It removes the barriers that usually keep ordinary cryptocurrency investors from engaging in more traditional mining (e.g., Bitcoin mining), getting rid of the need to buy and operate expensive mining hardware. Whatever it takes to get the Node Upgrade. https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/oxKHfS1QBY — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) December 1, 2025 Instead, PEPENODE enables users to build, update, and run their own virtual mining rigs, which they can grow by spending PEPENODE tokens on new nodes. By buying more nodes and by upgrading and combining them in novel ways, users can earn more mining rewards. PEPENODE will pay out these rewards in external tokens, including Fartcoin and Pepe, with other popular coins coming after launch. This ability to earn via a virtual rig should invite considerable demand for PEPENODE, boosting its price considerably. Investors will also be able to earn by selling on their nodes when they no longer need them, and by staking PEPENODE, which currently provides a yield of 576% APY . These features could make PEPENODE a very profitable token to hold, especially if the market does enter a bull phase around its launch. PEPENODE Presale Raises $2.25 Million: How to Buy Early In order to buy PEPENODE early, before it lists and potentially surges, investors can go to the coin’s official website . They can connect a compatible wallet (such as Best Wallet) and then purchase whatever amount of the coin they would like, using ETH, USDT, BNB, or fiat to pay. The token is currently selling at $0.0011778, a price which will continue to rise until the presale comes to its end. Given its tokenomics and fundamentals, it could rise much higher once it launches, so interested parties should act sooner rather than later. It will have a max supply of 210 billion PEPENODE, with allocation spread between marketing, development, listings, node rewards, and its treasury. Judging by the popularity of its presale, which has now raised $2.25 million, it could have a very big 2026.

Each of these products offers direct exposure to XRP by holding the underlying asset and issuing shares that reflect its market value. All XRP ETF’s on Vanguard today! Choose your fighter.. https://t.co/MLhsgJPgkJ pic.twitter.com/FSx9MQzNU5 — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) December 2, 2025 In addition to spot exposure, Vanguard has also made leveraged XRP ETFs available. These include funds offering amplified daily returns as well as those structured around enhanced income strategies. Products issued by Volatility Shares, Teucrium, ProShares, and Amplify fall into this category, allowing investors to participate in XRP price movements at varying degrees of intensity without interacting with the token directly. Collectively, these offerings represent one of the broadest selections of XRP-linked ETFs available on any major U.S. brokerage platform. Rapid Growth in Cumulative Inflows Spot XRP ETFs have been drawing significant capital since the launch of the first U.S. product in mid-November. By December 1, combined inflows had reached approximately $756 million. Within the following day, this figure rose to about $824 million, reflecting a notable increase over a single trading session. The rise was driven by steady demand across the four active spot funds, all of which continued to attract new capital without recording any outflows. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market participants have pointed out that sustained inflows of this size could lead to a meaningful reduction in the supply of XRP available on public exchanges. Since spot ETF issuers must purchase XRP to support their shares, continued demand naturally leads to incremental accumulation. Community commentators, including Steingraber, argue that this dynamic may have long-term implications for liquidity, particularly if inflows remain consistent as more ETFs begin trading. Several new products are also approaching availability. The recently approved 21Shares XRP ETF, along with an upcoming fund from WisdomTree, is expected to join the lineup on Vanguard once final preparations are completed. Their introduction would broaden investor access further and may contribute to additional inflow momentum. Vanguard’s inclusion of a diverse range of XRP ETFs represents an important step toward deeper integration of digital assets within traditional investment channels. The combination of spot and leveraged products offers investors multiple approaches to gaining exposure, while the strong inflow patterns suggest growing institutional interest. As more ETFs join the platform and demand continues to rise, the role of XRP within regulated financial markets may expand considerably in the months ahead.

That makes it yet another pardon that has not been granted to Sam Bankman-Fried, who continues to be courting the President’s attention for clemency. On Polymarket , traders are pricing his pardon at a 2% chance, while traders from Kalshi only see a 4% chance that SBF is pardoned before the end of this year. The current level is proof that people think there is little chance he gets a pardon from the same man whose political rival he funded. SBF’s pardon odds. Source: Polymarket David Gentile will keep the cash he cheated people out of Trump has used the presidential clemency power, such as pardons and sentence commutations, on several high-profile cases, including the January 6 Capitol rioters, former Rep. George Santos, who pleaded guilty to felony wire fraud and identity theft charges, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao convicted of money laundering, and even reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were also convicted of financial crimes. Each pardon has raised eyebrows, but perhaps the one that has garnered the most reactions has been his commutation of Gentile’s sentence, even though the man had only served 12 days out of a seven-year prison sentence when he was released, according to the New York Times. It should be noted that what Gentile got was not a full pardon, which usually forgives the crime and restores rights; it was a commutation that shortens or ends the sentence but leaves the conviction intact. Of course, this specific commutation stands out because it also got rid of all remaining fines, restitution, and forfeiture obligations, which effectively means Gentile does not need to repay his victims or face any further financial penalties tied to the federal case. Gentile was the founder and CEO of GPB Capital, a company prosecutors say raised about $1.6 billion from investors based on misrepresented success of the private equity fund. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, while addressing the matter on December 1, implied that the case had been revisited because the Biden-era Justice Department that oversaw the prosecution mischaracterized it as a Ponzi scheme, and Gentile had concerns about false testimony. “In short, again this is another example that has been brought to the president’s attention of a weaponization of the justice of the previous administration,” she said, declining to answer questions about the victims in the case. According to records from the Bureau of Prisons, Gentile was released on November 26, the day before Thanksgiving. “I am also deeply grateful to see David Gentile heading home to his young children,” Trump’s “pardon czar” Alice Marie Johnson said on X . “These are miracles of mercy, and each one reminds us of the extraordinary power of second chances.” SBF renews hopes for a pardon Trump’s pardons have mostly been reserved for crypto-adjacent figures with lighter sentences and strong MAGA ties. SBF does not fit into either category with his billion-dollar fraud conviction and massive donation to support Biden. Still, SBF is not giving up hope. His parents, Stanford Law professors Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, have been doing their best to lobby Trump allies, including a lawyer from his 2016/2020 campaigns, as well as figures like Tucker Carlson, who conducted an interview with SBF in prison in March 2025. They’re framing the conviction as a “Democratic witch hunt,” in hopes that it will help paint a picture of him being targeted by the Biden administration, a move that worked well for the likes of David Gentile. SBF himself has also ramped up his social media activity, arguing FTX was solvent at collapse. In a recent post, he claimed that global FTX creditors could have benefited more if the lawyers had approved the exchange’s sales. There is also the fact that SBF shared a prison block with the former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who had been serving a 45-year sentence in the U.S. for drug trafficking and firearms offenses. When Trump pardoned Hernandez, calling it an act of “justice,” and claiming Hernández was “framed” by prosecutors, SBF reacted with enthusiasm, commenting via his X account, which is being run by a friend. “I’m so glad Juan Orlando is free—few are more deserving than him.” SBF described Hernández as “one of the kindest and most dedicated people I’ve met” and an “honor” to befriend, even “under the worst possible circumstances.” It was SBF’s second post praising a Trump pardon. Before that, he commented positively on the CZ commutation. Unfortunately, the convicted executive’s efforts have been insufficient in getting a look from President Trump, and bettors aren’t counting on it happening either.

Even in the post-halving bullish phase in its historical four-year cycle, it still trades 85% below its 2021 all-time high of $3.10. In a recent podcast , Hoskinson blamed this weak performance on the outsized influence of macroeconomic events on the crypto market. A headwind that is now clearing as the U.S. Fed makes a significant policy shift, ending quantitative tightening (QT) alongside a $13.5 billion liquidity boost for banks.

Despite persistent frustration within portions of the community due to forecasts that have not yet materialized, he maintains that targets as high as $33 remain achievable. His latest commentary combines technical reasoning with a broader message centered on discipline and endurance, urging investors to remain focused on long-term developments rather than short-term market swings. A Message Addressed to XRP Supporters Egrag’s recent update contained an unusually personal tone. He encouraged his audience to view the current phase of the market as a period that demands consistency and patience. He referenced teachings from major religious texts, including passages from the Bible, Torah, and Quran, as a way of underscoring the value of perseverance. He highlighted verses that speak to perseverance and testing, arguing that successful long-term investing requires similar qualities. According to him, remaining committed to an asset like XRP, despite repeated market setbacks, reflects both conviction and a willingness to endure uncertainty. #XRP – Green Ball and Then Blast ($17 – $27 – $33): Many of you send me DMs or leave comments asking, ""Aren't you tired of stating and showing different ways to reach these targets?""

In response, he emphasized that the conclusions he draws are based on observable data and historical behavior rather than sentiment. He stated that although enthusiasm within the community fluctuates, the foundation of his analysis remains consistent. Technical Basis for the Forecast The core of Egrag’s argument relies on patterns he identified in XRP’s multi-year price history. He focused particularly on the 2-week chart, where he observed that extended rallies often begin after the price returns to the 21-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA). This level, he noted, has repeatedly acted as an area where momentum begins to rebuild after prolonged consolidation. He drew attention to two previous examples . In 2017, XRP increased sharply after touching the 21 EMA, ultimately rising by more than twelvefold. A comparable pattern emerged in 2021, though the price increase was more moderate at roughly fivefold. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Using these two cases as reference points, he calculated an average potential gain of about 905% if XRP were to follow a similar trajectory again. Under this framework, he believes that values between $17 and $33 are reasonable outcomes for the next major upward move. Although earlier projections from Egrag have led to mixed reactions over the years, he asserted that the long-term chart continues to show constructive signals. He argued that market conditions often appear discouraging immediately before major shifts take place, making patience a crucial component of any investment strategy. Community Expectations and Market Sentiment Egrag cautioned that volatility is likely to persist and that emotional reactions from market participants can distort judgment. He stressed that his forecasts are based solely on technical indicators, emphasizing that market data remains consistent even when opinions differ. According to him, those who focus on long-term trends rather than short-term price fluctuations are more likely to benefit from future market cycles. Egrag’s renewed forecast underscores his belief that XRP’s long-term potential remains intact, provided investors maintain realistic expectations and a patient outlook. By combining historical price behavior with a message centered on discipline, he argues that the path to higher valuations remains possible even if the timeline is uncertain. As market sentiment shifts repeatedly, he continues to advise the XRP community to remain calm, focused, and committed to the broader trend rather than immediate price movements.

55319695,639159,1764806420,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55319695.jpeg,Vanguard’s Policy Reversal Triggers Sharp Bitcoin Rally as $11T Giant Enters Crypto,https://bitcoinist.com/vanguards-policy-reversal-triggers-bitcoin-rally/,"A new CryptoQuant report from XWIN Research Japan reveals that the sharp +6% Bitcoin rally on December 2–3, 2025 was triggered by a seismic shift in traditional finance: Vanguard’s unexpected policy reversal. The $11 trillion asset manager—long known for its conservative stance—opened its platform to spot ETFs for BTC, ETH, XRP, and SOL, instantly giving more than 50 million investors access to crypto products. The move marks one of the most significant steps toward mainstream adoption in the industry’s history. The catalyst behind this reversal was the appointment of Salim Ramji, Vanguard’s new CEO and a former BlackRock executive who played a key role in launching the IBIT ETF. His leadership signaled a dramatic change in direction, and the market responded immediately. Once US markets opened, Bitcoin surged 6% in a single move, while IBIT surpassed $1 billion in trading volume within the first 30 minutes. Massive inflows from retail and retirement accounts followed, with Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas noting that “a large wave of Vanguard clients may have moved all at once.” Institutional Demand Builds as Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Recovers XWIN Research Japan notes that, despite the recent surge, the Coinbase Premium Index remains in negative territory, showing that US prices still sit slightly below global averages. Even so, the report highlights a clear improvement in US spot buying pressure, signaling that demand is slowly returning. If the premium rises back to zero or positive territory, the market may begin to price in what XWIN calls the “next wave” — a phase that could propel Bitcoin toward the $100K range as institutional flows strengthen. This shift is happening just as Vanguard makes its historic entrance into the crypto market. XWIN emphasizes that this is not a short-term catalyst. Vanguard manages $11 trillion, and even a tiny allocation — just 0.5% of assets flowing into crypto ETFs — would represent $55 billion in new capital. That figure alone exceeds the entire first-year inflow from the 2024 spot Bitcoin ETF cycle. With the “final giant” of traditional finance now participating, the long-term structure of Bitcoin demand is changing. Vanguard’s move signals the beginning of a genuine institutional adoption phase, where inflows can scale far beyond anything seen in previous cycles, potentially redefining Bitcoin’s upper price boundaries. Price Rebounds From Weekly Support but Faces Major Resistance Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows a strong rebound from the $84,000–$86,000 support zone, an area that aligns closely with the 100-week SMA. This level acted as a critical pivot during previous corrections, and once again buyers stepped in aggressively, forming a clear bullish reaction. The long lower wick from last week’s candle confirms strong demand, with BTC now trading back above $93,000. However, despite the rebound, the broader structure remains cautious. Bitcoin still trades below the 50-week SMA, which has begun to flatten near the $102,000–$103,000 region. This moving average now acts as a major resistance level and the next key test for bulls. A weekly close above it would mark a meaningful shift in momentum and signal that BTC may be ready to resume its broader uptrend. If BTC continues to hold above the 100-week SMA and pushes toward the 50-week SMA, the market could enter a consolidation phase that sets the stage for a stronger upside move.

XRP Price Consolidation Nears Its End On the higher-timeframe 2-day chart, Osemka frames the structure as a classic flat correction built on top of the 2021 high. “Here’s the range and levels to help you navigate it. We’re basing on top of 2021 high,” he writes, adding that “we’ve also never broken down after going sideways for this long, so I remain with my view of this being an accumulation range and a flat correction.” Related Reading: XRP Whale Wallets Collapse 20%, But Biggest Holders Hoard More Than Ever His chart shows XRP oscillating in a horizontal band whose floor aligns with the 2021 high, labeled as a “Reaccumulation” area. Price has repeatedly tagged this support and bounced, while midrange resistance in the low-to-mid $2 zone has capped multiple rallies. Above, a higher horizontal line marks the January spike, which Osemka treats as the cycle top. Internally, he maps an A–B–C corrective sequence. The B leg forms a dotted ascending channel, labeled as a 3-legged “abc” wave. “That dotted ascending range in the middle (3 legged abc wave in B) has me optimistic as that is a corrective move that is synonymous for a flat correction,” he explains. “Meaning the top was in January and this indeed is only a sideways correction.” The current C leg is contained within a downward “Corrective channel” pointing back toward the lower band. For Osemka, even a deeper test of support would not necessarily be bearish for the larger structure: “If we end up taking the lower end of the range with C leg it’ll remain to be seen. But if so, it’d be a great buying opportunity.” He also calls XRP “a perfect example on why I view BTC also as a flat correction with the top in January,” arguing that “while Bitcoin is messy, XRP is very clean.” Why Its Now Or Never For XRP Dom zooms in on the last six weeks of that broader range and focuses on the microstructure that could trigger a move back toward the upper band. “If you inverse the chart over the last 6 weeks, you’ll see a perfect 3 drive pattern, a very accurate reversal setup in crypto,” he writes. On the non-inverted chart, this corresponds to three downside pushes that fail to extend lower, followed by what he calls a higher low: “We can see a HL has finally formed which can hint at the first sign of a trend change developing.” His 8-hour chart highlights the monthly rolling VWAP as the key pivot. “Bulls needs to regain the monthly rVWAP around $2.22 and that would be the shift for a rally back towards ~$2.50,” Dom says. That ~$2.50 area aligns with higher VWAP clusters and the upper portion of Osemka’s range. Related Reading: XRP Price About $1,000 Is A Necessity, Analyst Claims Order-book and skew data back his view that conditions are ripe for a break if buyers step in. “Orderbooks are clear, if there was a time, it’s now for this trend to shift,” he notes, pointing to relatively clean liquidity overhead and a recovering skew after a washed-out short side. The downside is equally explicit: “If this setup fails, acceptance under $2 is next and the end of year is ugly.” That would mean a decisive loss of the long-defended support band built on the 2021 high and a deeper completion of the C leg in Osemka’s flat-correction structure. For now, XRP remains compressed between the $2.00 support, the $2.22 monthly rVWAP trigger and the ~$2.50 upside magnet, with the six-week 3-drive pattern and flat-correction range jointly defining one of the clearest technical inflection points on the XRP chart this year. At press time, XRP traded at $2.1798.

Price dropped toward the True Market Mean, the cost basis of all active coins minus miners, and then held there. According to Glassnode, that level splits light bear phases from deep bear markets. For now, price is sitting just above it. The structure around it now matches what showed up in Q1 2022 almost tick for tick. Spot price moved under the 0.75 supply quantile in mid‑November and now trades near $96.1K, putting more than 25% of total supply underwater. At the same time, sellers may already be worn out. The line that changes everything is still the 0.85 quantile near $106.2K. Until price takes that level back, macro shocks keep full control of direction. Glassnode data shows that Bitcoin’s Net Change in Realized Cap reads +$8.69B per month, which is pretty weak compared to the $64.3B per month peak in July, but it is not exactly negative either. As long as this stays above zero, price can still build a base instead of falling apart. Meanwhile, long‑term investors continue to sell into strength, but at shrinking margins, with the Long‑Term Holder SOPR (30D‑SMA) stands at 1.43. Derivatives and options reset risk across the board Spot demand now looks lighter. U.S. Bitcoin ETFs flipped into net outflows across November on a three‑day average basis. The steady inflow that supported price earlier this year is gone. Outflows hit many issuers at once. Institutions pulled back as market pressure built. That leaves price more exposed to outside shocks. At the same time, Cumulative Volume Delta turned negative on Binance and across the aggregate exchange group. That signals steady taker selling. Coinbase flattened as well. That removed a key sign of U.S. bid strength. With ETF flows and CVD both defensive, spot demand now runs thin. Derivatives followed the same path. Futures open interest kept falling through late November. The unwind stayed slow and orderly. The leverage built during the uptrend is now mostly gone. New leverage is not entering. Funding rates cooled near zero after months of positive prints. Modest negative funding showed up at times but never lasted long. Shorts are not pressing hard. Positioning now sits neutral and flat. In options, implied volatility dropped after last week’s spike. Bitcoin failed to hold above $92K, and sellers stepped back in, so short‑dated volatility fell from 57% to 48%, mid‑tenor slid from 52% to 45%, and long‑dated eased from 49% to 47%. Short‑term skew fell from 18.6% to 8.4% after Bitcoin’s price rebounded from $84.5K, a drop tied to the Japanese bond shock. Longer maturities moved slower. Traders chased short‑term upside but stayed unsure about follow‑through. Early week flow leaned heavy on put buying tied to fears of a repeat of the August 2024 carry‑trade stress. Once price stabilized, flow flipped to calls during the rebound. At the $100K call strike, call premium sold still exceeds call premium bought, and the gap widened during the past 48 hours. That shows weak conviction to reclaim six figures. Traders also sit ahead of the FOMC meeting without chasing upside.

Leverage rises with long/short ratios above 2.2 on major venues, amplifying liquidation risks. Spot outflows slow, with a modest $620K inflow marking the first positive reading in weeks. By Parshwa Turakhiya Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) is attempting to stabilize after a two-month slide that pushed the token to a low near $0.13, marking one of its deepest drawdowns of the year. The recovery toward $0.15 reflects tentative dip-buying interest, but the broader structure remains defined by a persistent downtrend channel and a market still unwinding excess leverage. DOGE has not collapsed, yet the burden of proof has shifted firmly onto buyers. The daily chart continues to show DOGE respecting a clean descending channel, with overhead resistance between $0.158 and $0.165, where the mid-channel boundary intersects the 20-day EMA. A rejection here would keep downward momentum intact and risk a retest of the lower channel line near $0.125, a level that has repeatedly acted as a liquidity floor. DOGE price analysis (Source: TradingView) The more decisive battleground sits higher, between $0.171 and $0.18. This zone aligns with the 50-day EMA and a horizontal shelf that capped price action throughout early Q4. Until DOGE clears that area, rallies remain corrective rather than structural. Yet the long-term accumulation base stretching back to March continues to hold. As long as the price stays above $0.128–$0.13, Dogecoin avoids structural damage and maintains the slow-build accumulation narrative that has underpinned its broader cycle. A breakdown below that floor would shift the market toward deeper support at $0.105–$0.11, an area known for abrupt and volatile reversals when liquidity thins and shorts overextend. Momentum indicators reflect this transitional phase. RSI sits near 45, rising from oversold territory but not yet signaling trend reversal. Historically, DOGE requires a breakout of the 55–60 RSI band to trigger sustained upside, a threshold the market has yet to approach. Flows and positioning reveal a market repairing, not rallying Spot flows show a market that has shed considerable risk. Repeated $40–100 million net outflows through September and October underscored investor reluctance to commit capital. The most recent print, however, shows a $620,000 inflow, the first positive reading in weeks. While small, it indicates the bleeding has slowed and sellers are no longer dominating every bounce. The derivatives market tells a more complicated story. Open interest has risen 8.6 percent to $1.5 billion, with volume jumping 42 percent. Long/short ratios above 2.2 on major venues point to a heavily long-biased market, meaning the current bounce is driven by leverage rather than organic spot demand. If DOGE fails to break resistance, these leveraged longs risk liquidation cascades that could accelerate downside entirely through mechanical unwinds. This dynamic is not unfamiliar. The last time DOGE saw rising open interest during a downtrend, the market was setting up for a washout that ultimately produced the late-Q1 rally. Rising leverage into weakness is historically fragile. A controlled squeeze lower could clear positioning and reset conditions for a healthier upside attempt - an outcome paradoxically favorable for medium-term bulls. The short-term roadmap remains binary. A reclaim of $0.171–$0.18 would break the downtrend and open room toward $0.20–$0.21, where the 200-day EMA sits and where prior rallies failed. Conversely, a drop below $0.138–$0.14 would expose DOGE to a liquidity flush toward $0.115, a level where mean-reversion traders historically step in aggressively. A market digesting, not collapsing The deeper narrative surrounding DOGE is one of digestion rather than deterioration. The token is shedding speculative leverage accumulated earlier in the year while attempting to stabilize above long-term support. Spot selling has slowed, derivatives positioning is stretched but active, and sentiment remains hesitant but not despairing. DOGE is now balanced between two competing forces: cheap enough to interest value-focused buyers, but not strong enough to force shorts to unwind. The next test of resistance will determine whether this bounce becomes a trend or fades into another liquidity event in a market still detoxing from its last cycle. In earlier coverage, we noted that Dogecoin’s structure had entered a slow-grind corrective phase rather than a collapse, with long-term support levels showing resilience even as leverage unwound. The current price behavior aligns with that view. DOGE is still repairing, not reversing, and the key catalysts ahead remain its ability to reclaim EMAs and reverse the descending channel that has defined sentiment since early Q4.

According to reports from Bloomberg and the Financial Times, drones sweep across rooftops, scanning for strange heat signals inside abandoned houses, vacant shops, and other dead zones. These hot spots almost always point to rigs running nonstop. On the ground, police walk with handheld sensors that pick up unusual electricity use. Citizens allegedly report birds chirping all night, but it’s just fake sounds playing on speakers to cover the roar of mining machines behind locked doors. Miners move quickly. They set up in one place, install heat shields to hide their equipment, mount CCTV cameras, and wire their entrances with broken glass. Then they vanish before authorities arrive. Over the last five years, officers have tracked down 14,000 illegal sites linked to power theft.That’s what the Energy Ministry said in the latest breakdown.The damage to Tenaga Nasional, Malaysia’s state-owned utility, has hit around $1.1 billion and counting. By October, 3,000 new cases had already been logged just this year as Bitcoin’s price went up, crashed over 30 percent, and started rising again. Taskforce forms to chase down mining operators On November 19, Malaysia launched a new taskforce made up of the Ministry of Finance, Bank Negara Malaysia, and TNB. Akmal Nasrullah Mohd Nasir, who serves as deputy minister of energy transition and water transformation, is in charge of the team. “You can actually even break our facilities. It becomes a challenge to our system,” Akmal said on Wednesday. The rigs that miners use run around the clock, blasting out trillions of guesses every second. That’s how they validate transactions and get rewarded in Bitcoin. It’s a race. The more guesses you make, the better your odds. But it also burns massive amounts of electricity. One group turned ElementX Mall, a half-dead shopping center overlooking the Strait of Malacca, into a full-on crypto farm. The mall shut down during the pandemic and never bounced back. Floors are still unfinished. Wires hang from the ceiling. In early 2022, Bitcoin rigs filled the space. By 2025, they were gone. A TikTok video made the whole thing public. A report from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance said over 75 percent of mining now happens in the United States. Malaysia used to hold 2.5 percent of global hashrate in January 2022, but Chainalysis hasn’t released a report/data on that since then. Miners occupy failed malls, logging sites across country Another outfit called Bityou took over a former logging yard in Sarawak. Under Malaysian law, Bitcoin mining is legal. But only if you get your power legally and pay your taxes. Akmal isn’t buying it. He’s joined raids before. He’s seen how these groups operate. When the taskforce held its first meeting on November 25, some members pushed to outlaw mining altogether. “Even if you run it properly, the challenge is that the market itself is very volatile,” Akmal said . “I don’t see any well-run mining that can be considered as successful legally.” He also thinks the way these operations move around shows signs of organized crime. “It’s clearly run by the syndicate, because of how mobile they are from setting up in one place to another place,” Akmal said. “It does have modus operandi.” Get seen where it counts.

CryptoQuant reports that the company’s monthly purchases decreased from 134,000 BTC at the 2024 peak to just 9,100 BTC in November 2025, with only 135 BTC so far this month. According to the data analytics firm, the 24-month buffer is a clear indication that Strategy is bracing for the bear market. On November 17th, Strategy acquired 8,178 BTC for approximately $835.5 million, its largest purchase since July, bringing its total holdings to 649,870 BTC, valued at approximately $58.7 billion at the time of writing. The firm has been the subject of intense speculation over the last several months following a downturn in the crypto market and the unwinding of the BTC proxy trade , which included digital asset treasury companies that accumulate crypto and mining operations. Strategy secures $1.4B cash reserve Just a few weeks ago, Strategy CEO Phong Le said the company might sell some of its Bitcoin to cover debt costs , but only if its stock falls below net asset value (NAV) or if it loses access to financing. The company has also set aside a $1.4 billion cash reserve to cover dividend payments and debt obligations. This reserve is expected to provide a 12-month runway, with plans to expand it to cover 24 months, the company added. Strategy’s attempt to join major stock market indexes has faced obstacles.MSCI, which sets eligibility criteria for many of these indexes, has suggested a policy change that would bar treasury companies holding 50% or more of their balance-sheet assets in digital assets. The directive would cut off firms like Strategy from the passive inflows that come with index inclusion. Michael Saylor, the co-founder of Strategy, recently stated that Strategy is engaging with MSCI regarding the proposed policy change, which is set to take effect in January. Bitcoin bounces to align with industry cost benchmarks Bitcoin is closely monitored with the Difficulty Regression Model, according t o checkonchai n . This model estimates the all-in sustaining production cost for the network. The model treats mining difficulty as a distilled measure of mining price, as it incorporates all major operational variables into a single figure. This provides a n industry-wide estimate of the average cost to produce one Bitcoin, eliminating the need for detailed assumptions about hardware, energ y expens es, or logistics. This model is currently priced at approximately $92,300, roughly the same as Bitcoin’s spot price. Bitcoin tumbled briefly to around $80,000 but has since come back to the model. When Bitcoin moves above the model, then it tends to signal a bull market; when its price moves beneath it, it often indicates a bear market. In April 2025, Bitcoin dropped to $76,000, but was supported at the model’s value. Bitcoin was traded roughly 50% above the model for the majority of 2025; in 2024, however, prices stayed closer to it. Bitcoin was quoted as much as 50% below the model during the 2022 bear market. In previous bull markets, it has soared far above the model — doubling its price at the 2021 peak and five times the model’s value in 2017. As Bitcoin matures into an asset, premiums near those levels seem a thing of the past. Overall, the model suggests Bitcoin is currently priced near its production cost, which can be interpreted as a fair value zone . Metcalfe’s bas ed valuations also place bitcoin near fair value around $90,000, reinforcing that assessment.

RSI near 66 signals strong but cooling momentum. On chain flows turn mildly positive after prolonged weakness. By Ashutosh Sureka Uniswap ( UNI-USD ) is trading at $6.07, up 10.7% in the past 24 hours, extending its rebound after a sharp recovery from the mid-$5.40 zone. The market cap stands at $3.82 billion, while daily trading volume at $498.52 million reflects heavy participation as buyers returned aggressively after yesterday’s capitulation drop. The day’s range between $5.39 and $6.17 highlights strong intraday volatility as UNI stabilizes above a key short-term resistance band. Uniswap price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Technical structure analysis UNI remains below major EMAs on higher timeframes, but short-term structure shows clear improvement. The 20 EMA sits near $5.87, the 50 EMA near $5.93, the 100 EMA around $6.02, and the 200 EMA close to $6.03. Price has reclaimed the faster EMAs and is now pressing directly into the heavier 100 and 200 EMAs, signalling early trend repair though not yet a confirmed breakout. RSI on the 1-hour chart sits near 66.63 after an earlier spike toward 79.06, showing strong momentum that has cooled but remains constructive. UNI needs a decisive break above $6.20 for continuation, while slipping below $5.85 risks reopening downside toward last week’s lows. On-chain flows analysis On-chain flows have turned mildly positive after weeks of persistent red prints. Coinglass data shows a net inflow of about $762.17k on 3 December, marking one of the strongest green spikes in recent sessions. This follows a long period of heavy outflows throughout October and November, during which market cap compression mirrored retreating sentiment. The latest stabilization in market cap suggests selective rotation back into DeFi despite overall caution. Sentiment and fundamentals UNI’s broader tone has improved as DeFi assets staged a sector-wide rebound. Liquidity remains thin, but whale accumulation has supported the recovery. However, strong overhead supply between $6.15 and $6.30 continues to cap momentum. Protocol-level developments have not yet sparked a major shift in behaviour, meaning sustained progress still depends on broader market tone and improved flow dynamics. Short-term outlook UNI has shown a strong intraday recovery with early signs of stabilization. Holding above $5.85 keeps the constructive structure intact, while clearing $6.20 is required to confirm a deeper push higher. Without this breakout, UNI remains vulnerable to pullbacks if broader sentiment weakens. In earlier analysis, UNI was trading near $5.48 with persistent outflows, heavy EMA resistance overhead, and weak momentum near oversold territory. Today’s rebound marks the first meaningful structural improvement since that decline, but confirmation still requires reclaiming the $6.20 level.

Related Reading: Crypto Investors Brace As Japan Proposes 20% Tax By 2027 The move follows a month-long slide that erased nearly 20% from recent highs and raised questions about whether the broader uptrend was losing strength. Consequently, about $250 million in BTC short positions have been liquidated. Institutional Access Expands as Vanguard Lifts ETF Ban The most notable catalyst for the rebound came from Vanguard, which reversed its long-standing ban on Bitcoin ETFs . The decision immediately opened access to tens of millions of retail accounts and allowed products such as BlackRock’s IBIT to trade on the platform, generating more than $1 billion in volume on day one. The policy shift triggered a rapid surge in demand and helped fuel more than $400 million in short liquidations as Bitcoin jumped from the mid-$88,000 area to above $93,000 within hours. Analysts note that several major firms, including Robinhood and Fidelity, added significant BTC exposure during the session. Combined with stablecoin issuers expanding supply in recent weeks, liquidity across the crypto market has broadened. Macro Shifts and Technical Levels Support the Recovery The rebound coincided with the U.S. Federal Reserve ending its quantitative tightening programme and injecting fresh funds into short-term markets. Repo facility usage also increased, improving liquidity for risk assets. Traders now assign high probability to a rate cut at the Fed’s December meeting. Across the market , major assets followed Bitcoin higher. Ethereum traded near $3,000, Solana reached $142, and XRP climbed back above $2.18. Market indexes tracking large-cap cryptocurrencies rose around 7%, while the Crypto Fear & Greed Index moved off extreme fear levels. Technical indicators are showing early signs of stabilisation. Analysts highlight the $86,000–$88,000 range as a key support zone that has held through repeated tests in recent months. Bitcoin is also pressing against resistance between $92,500 and $94,000, forming an ascending triangle pattern. Renewed $100K Bitcoin Targets, but Debate Over Trend Strength Remains Despite the strong bounce, analysts remain divided on whether Bitcoin is entering a renewed expansion phase or simply retracing after a sharp correction. Some warn that deeper downtrends historically unfold over longer periods. Others argue that rising institutional participation and on-chain activity resemble previous mid-cycle resets rather than the start of a prolonged decline.

Related Reading: XRP Is About To Hit A Major Turning Point This Week, Analyst Says The well-known investor/entrepreneur said he is not investing as if the Fed will ease policy, and he thinks Bitcoin will likely drift within 5% of its current level. Fed Cut Odds Skyrocketing According to the CME FedWatch Tool, markets are now pricing in an 89% chance of a December rate cut, a big swing from just weeks earlier when odds were far lower. This shift in expectations has been a main driver of recent moves in risk assets, including crypto. LATEST 🚨 Kevin O’Leary just said a December Fed rate cut is unlikely because inflation is still too high! He also said “It’s not going to make a difference to Bitcoin.” Do you agree? 🤔 pic.twitter.com/lJBrW4Z2kA — That Martini Guy ₿ (@MartiniGuyYT) December 3, 2025 Bitcoin Reacts To Shift In Sentiment Based on reports from market trackers, Bitcoin climbed after a recent dip, recovering from a low near $83,000 to trade around $93,700 in early trading sessions. Coingecko listed the price roughly in the $92,700–$92,800 band during morning trade. Traders point to support at $90,000 and resistance near $92,500, and some desk notes say a clean break above that could open a run toward $94K–$95K. Why O’Leary Is Skeptical O’Leary has flagged higher prices in the economy and sticky input costs as reasons the Fed might hold off. Reports show US consumer prices rose at a 3% annual rate in September, the fastest since January, a datapoint he cited to argue inflation still matters. The inflation numbers are being watched closely by policymakers weighing the trade-off between jobs and prices. Liquidity Moves Add Fuel Reports have disclosed that the Fed quietly put more than $13 billion of liquidity into short-term funding, a move some analysts say has helped restore liquidity in money markets and supported risk assets. That liquidity boost, together with the pause in Quantitative Tightening, has been flagged by quant desks as one reason bullish momentum returned to crypto. Market Reaction O’Leary’s take is at odds with the market odds and with several analysts who see easier monetary policy as a tailwind for assets like Bitcoin. He is not alone in warning against reading too much into a single Fed decision, but many traders have already positioned for easing and that positioning has moved prices.

But is it better?",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/silver-higher-than-gold-but-is-it-better/,"Silver is outperforming gold in 2025, and it’s all because demand has blown past what miners can dig up, while electronics, electric vehicles, and solar companies are all grabbing for the same shrinking pile of metal. As of early December, silver has doubled in price year-to-date, while gold surged by 60% in comparison. Both metals are having the time of their lives though, as investors are steadily ducking out of fiat and into hard assets. But it’s silver that’s flashing red on the supply side, and it’s not built to handle this kind of squeeze. Inventories are scraping the bottom. Supply isn’t keeping up. The risk now is broader: companies across sectors could face shortages if the current pace holds. The market is already showing signs of stress, and nobody’s stepping in to bail it out. There’s no silver equivalent of central banks lending metal into the system like they do with gold. When liquidity dries up here, it just… dries up. Silver moves electricity better than almost anything on earth, which is why it’s built into circuit boards, switches, batteries, and charging stations. But with margins already thin, high silver costs make it harder to stay profitable. Jewelry demand for silver is still strong, especially in China and India, where silver is passed down as a family asset. The three biggest silver producers are Mexico, Peru, and China, who right now are dealing with everything from regulatory delays to environmental crackdowns. ETF flows, weak mining, and option bets trap Silver investors. Do they have a plan? According to data from LSEG, the global total silver stash is currently under $50 billion. For comparison, gold sits at around $1.2 trillion, with a huge chunk of that in central bank vaults (especially the Bank of England) where it can be lent into markets when things get tight. That system doesn’t exist for silver, so yeah, it’s every trader for themselves. Still, silver is cheap per ounce compared to gold too, so it is so much easier to buy for retail investors, though also riskier. But for those guys, this is a non-issue. Meanwhile, physical silver-backed ETFs picked up 15.7 million ounces in November alone. Holdings have climbed in 9 of the last 11 months. These are active bets on supply staying tight and prices staying hot. But it’s not just ETFs. The options market is on fire too. Jonathan Krinsky, chief markets technician at BTIG, pointed out that the iShares Silver Trust (SLV), which tracks the metal’s performance, posted three straight daily gains of 2.5% or more in the past week. “That’s only happened five other times in the ETF’s history (back to ’06). Four of the five occurred either at, or right before, a major peak for SLV,” he said. Silver skew (a measure of call-option demand over puts) jumped 8 points to hit 10 percentage points in two weeks, which is the highest since March 2022 and also means that betting on an upside just got a lot more expensive.

Jacob King, CEO of crypto media outlet SwanDesk, has launched a stunning critique against MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, a famed Bitcoin bull. King claims Saylor has reversed his Bitcoin predictions approximately 50 times, with all of them ultimately proving incorrect. This bold accusation challenges the narrative surrounding one of crypto’s most vocal advocates. What Are the Specific Criticisms of Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin Predictions? Jacob King’s criticism extends beyond mere inconsistency. He contrasts Saylor’s long-term bullish forecasts with Bitcoin’s short-term volatility. King points out that while the U.S. dollar lost 39% of its purchasing power over 19 years, Bitcoin experienced a similar drop in just two weeks. From this, he draws a controversial conclusion: the cryptocurrency is ‘useless’ as a stable store of value. This directly attacks the core ‘digital gold’ thesis that Saylor and many others passionately defend. How Do Saylor’s Own Forecasts Contradict This Criticism? The criticism becomes even more intriguing when held against Saylor’s own very public and optimistic Bitcoin predictions . In a previous CNBC interview, Saylor outlined a staggering roadmap for BTC’s future: Reaching $150,000 by the end of this year. Climbing to $1 million within the next four to eight years. Ascending to an almost unimaginable $20 million within two decades. These forecasts form the bedrock of his public stance, making King’s claim of 50 reversals a serious allegation of hypocrisy or poor analysis. Why Does This Debate About Bitcoin Predictions Matter? This isn’t just a war of words between two executives. It highlights a fundamental tension in the crypto market between evangelistic long-term belief and pragmatic short-term scrutiny. For investors, understanding the track record of influential voices is crucial. Inconsistent Bitcoin predictions can create market noise and confusion, making it harder for individuals to separate hype from credible analysis. This debate forces the community to ask: should price forecasts be the primary measure of a cryptocurrency’s value? What Can We Learn From This Clash of Perspectives? Ultimately, this episode serves as a powerful reminder for every crypto participant. It underscores the importance of conducting your own research (DYOR) rather than blindly following any single figure, no matter how prominent. Market predictions, especially in a nascent and volatile asset class like cryptocurrency, are inherently uncertain. The key takeaway is to focus on underlying technology, adoption metrics, and macroeconomic factors, not just charismatic Bitcoin predictions . In summary , the clash between SwanDesk’s Jacob King and MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor exposes the volatile and often contradictory nature of cryptocurrency commentary. While Saylor paints a picture of Bitcoin’s inevitable mega-rise, King counters with accusations of unreliable forecasting and highlights its extreme price swings. For the savvy observer, the truth likely lies somewhere in between, emphasizing the need for critical thinking and a diversified perspective in the dynamic world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: How many times does Jacob King claim Michael Saylor reversed his Bitcoin price predictions? A: Jacob King, CEO of SwanDesk, claims that Michael Saylor has reversed his Bitcoin price predictions approximately 50 times. Q: What was Michael Saylor’s most optimistic Bitcoin price prediction? A: In a CNBC interview, Saylor predicted Bitcoin could reach $150,000 by year-end, $1 million in 4-8 years, and a staggering $20 million within 20 years. Q: Why does Jacob King argue Bitcoin is ‘useless’? A: King compares metrics, noting that while the US dollar’s purchasing power fell 39% over 19 years, Bitcoin fell by the same amount in just two weeks, leading him to question its utility as a stable store of value. Q: Who is Michael Saylor? A: Michael Saylor is the co-founder and Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy (MSTR), a business intelligence company that has made massive Bitcoin purchases, making him one of the most prominent corporate advocates for BTC. Q: What is the main lesson for investors from this debate? A: The key lesson is the importance of independent research (DYOR) and not relying solely on the predictions of any single individual, no matter how influential, due to the inherent volatility and uncertainty of cryptocurrency markets.

With momentum building and key resistance levels now within reach, the market is bracing for what could be a major explosive move. BTC Climbs Above 93,160 As Cup & Handle Targets 104,000 Charting BTC on the 4-hour timeframe, analyst Kamile Uray revealed that the price is currently moving above the $93,160 level. Uray is closely monitoring the price, as a successful close above this level would confirm the breakout of a recently formed cup and handle pattern. According to this classic pattern, a confirmed breakout targets the $104,000 level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rallies Into Resistance With Traders Watching for Breakout Confirmation If BTC reaches the $104,000 target without forming a wicking reversal, it would also decisively break the falling blue trendline. Breaking both this trendline and the pattern target would provide strong evidence for the continuation of the overall uptrend. The analyst highlighted that the next major resistances are located at the $98,200 and $107,500 levels. A break above $107,500 and the falling blue trend on the daily chart will serve as the ultimate sign that the long-term uptrend is fully resumed. Uray suggests that retests after the breakout of the pink box ( the handle resistance area) can be evaluated as potential trade entries. The mandatory stop-loss for these trades should be placed at a daily close below the pink box, maintaining strict risk management. Conversely, should the price fail to hold the pink box, the immediate support zone to watch is the $83,822 – $82,477 region below. A bearish scenario is confirmed by a daily close below $82,477, signaling a continuation of the downtrend. In this case, the market would likely seek the next support zone at $74,496 – $71,237, which represents the previous top broken in November 2024. If this zone holds, a major uptrend reversal could be expected again. IH&S Pattern Confirms Reversal Momentum According to a recent update by Crypto VIP Signal, Bitcoin’s recent price action has confirmed a significant bullish reversal. The asset has successfully surpassed the $87,500 mark and has also broken through the key level of $90,000. This upward movement confirms that the Inverse Head and Shoulders (IH&S) pattern has acted as expected, triggering a strong trend reversal signal. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders See First Uptick Since April Lows: Bullish Sign? The analyst noted that the current market structure appears strong because the price increase is being supported by healthy trading volume. With the reversal confirmed, Crypto VIP Signal noted that the next technical benchmark for the market is $95,000, and it will be interesting to see how the price behaves when it tests this resistance point.

55324874,639271,1764813647,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55324874.jpeg,Crypto-To-Politics Donation Pipeline Under Threat As UK Mulls Ban,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-money-politics-uk-officials-move-toward-ban/,"Britain is weighing a ban on crypto political donations as lawmakers raise alarm over traceability and foreign influence. Reports have disclosed that ministers are discussing a move to bar parties and candidates from accepting gifts in cryptocurrency as part of changes tied to the upcoming Elections Bill. Who Is Likely To Be Hit? Reform UK , which has already opened a portal to take bitcoin and other digital tokens, would be directly affected if a ban goes ahead. Reports show Reform became the first European party to accept crypto donations in late May 2025, and the move has drawn fresh attention to how digital coins can be used in politics. Campaign finance figures underline the stakes. In recent reporting, the Conservative Party raised £6.3 million in the first half of the year compared with Reform’s £2.1 million over the same period — numbers that help explain why any new fundraising channel is politically sensitive. Why Officials Say They Are Worried According to ministers and watchdogs, the problem is not the technology itself but the way tokens can hide who is really sending money. Wallets on blockchains are pseudonymous, and tools exist that can mix or obscure transactions, making it hard to link a donation to a named donor. That raises the risk of foreign or illicit funds slipping into UK campaigns. UK Eyes #Crypto Political Donation Ban, Threatening Farage’s Reform War Chest UK government considers banning #crypto political donations, treatening Nigel Farage’s Reform UK fundraising pic.twitter.com/cTIghUkbGn — CryptOpus (@ImCryptOpus) December 2, 2025 Groups that track corruption have backed stronger rules. Spotlight on corruption and other campaigners have urged lawmakers to close loopholes and give regulators clearer powers to trace suspect funding. They say more than guidance is needed; legal changes and extra resources for investigators will be necessary if the system is to be effective. Crypto Donation Ban: How Enforcement Could Become Difficult Even if Parliament were to require crypto donations to be converted into pounds within a set period or funneled only through regulated providers, enforcement would remain tricky. Some officials believe new offences tied to illicit political funding and better police tools would be needed, while others warn that drafting workable rules will take time. Full Or Partial Ban? Lawmakers will debate whether to introduce a full ban, a partial ban, or tighter rules that force transparency and use of vetted intermediaries. Reports indicate the idea is under active discussion, but it is unclear whether change can be written into law before the next election cycle. Reform UK leaders have said they already accept crypto donations and view them as part of a wider pitch to voters; critics argue the timing and lack of clear oversight make that risky.

This vision is becoming reality as traditional banking embraces blockchain technology. In a groundbreaking move, Hana Financial Group has partnered with Dunamu, operator of South Korea’s largest crypto exchange Upbit, to integrate blockchain for remittances into their financial services. This collaboration signals a major shift in how traditional institutions approach cross-border payments. Why Is This Partnership a Game-Changer for Blockchain for Remittances? The December 4th announcement represents more than just another corporate partnership. It marks a significant moment where established financial giants recognize blockchain’s potential to solve real-world problems. Traditional remittance systems often suffer from high costs, slow processing times, and opaque tracking. However, blockchain for remittances offers a compelling alternative with its decentralized ledger technology. According to the memorandum of understanding signed at Hana Financial’s headquarters, the companies plan to develop new financial services that leverage blockchain’s strengths. The timing is particularly interesting as financial institutions worldwide explore digital asset integration. This partnership positions both companies at the forefront of South Korea’s financial innovation landscape. What Specific Services Will Use Blockchain Technology? The implementation will occur in carefully planned phases, beginning with internal transfers. Here’s what the rollout looks like: Phase One (Q1 2024) : Hana Bank will implement blockchain for remittances between its headquarters and overseas branches Phase Two : Expansion to subsidiaries and partner institutions Future Applications : Integration into broader foreign exchange operations and Hana Money service This gradual approach allows for testing and refinement while minimizing disruption to existing services. The phased rollout demonstrates practical wisdom in adopting new technology within regulated financial environments. How Will Blockchain Transform Overseas Money Transfers? Traditional international transfers face several challenges that blockchain directly addresses. Conventional systems rely on multiple intermediaries, each adding time and cost to transactions. In contrast, blockchain for remittances creates a more direct pathway for funds. The benefits customers can expect include: Faster Processing : Transactions that previously took days could complete in minutes Reduced Costs : Lower intermediary fees translate to better rates for customers Enhanced Transparency : Real-time tracking of transfer status Improved Security : Cryptographic protection against fraud and errors These improvements matter particularly for South Korea’s substantial expatriate community and international business sector. The partnership’s success could inspire similar initiatives across Asia’s financial landscape. What Challenges Might This Innovation Face? Despite the exciting potential, implementing blockchain for remittances at scale presents challenges. Regulatory compliance remains paramount, especially in South Korea’s carefully monitored financial sector. The partnership must navigate existing financial regulations while pioneering new approaches. Technical integration represents another consideration. Merging legacy banking systems with blockchain infrastructure requires careful planning and execution. User adoption forms the final piece – customers must trust and understand the new system enough to use it regularly. However, the combined expertise of Hana Financial’s banking experience and Dunamu’s blockchain knowledge creates a strong foundation for overcoming these hurdles. Their collaborative approach suggests they’re prepared for the implementation journey ahead. Conclusion: A New Era for Financial Services The Hana Financial-Dunamu partnership represents more than a technological upgrade – it signals a fundamental shift in how financial institutions approach innovation. By embracing blockchain for remittances , they’re addressing genuine customer pain points while positioning themselves for the digital finance future. This collaboration demonstrates that traditional banking and cryptocurrency sectors can work together to create practical solutions. As the first quarter 2024 implementation approaches, the financial world will watch closely. Success could accelerate blockchain adoption across global banking, making international money transfers faster, cheaper, and more transparent for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions When will Hana Financial’s blockchain remittance service launch? The service will launch in phases, beginning with internal transfers between Hana Bank’s headquarters and overseas branches in the first quarter of 2024. Expansion to broader services will follow gradually. Will this partnership involve cryptocurrencies directly? While Dunamu operates the Upbit cryptocurrency exchange, the initial focus appears to be on using blockchain technology to improve traditional remittance systems rather than introducing direct cryptocurrency transfers. How will blockchain make remittances cheaper? Blockchain reduces the number of intermediaries involved in cross-border transfers, which typically lowers processing fees. The transparent nature of blockchain also helps identify and eliminate unnecessary costs in the transfer chain. Is this service only for South Korean customers? Initially, the service will connect Hana Bank’s Korean headquarters with its international branches. However, as the service expands, it will likely become available to more customers conducting transfers between South Korea and other countries. How does this compare to existing blockchain remittance services? This partnership is significant because it involves a major traditional bank integrating blockchain technology into its established services, potentially bringing blockchain benefits to customers who prefer using conventional banking channels. What security measures will protect these blockchain transactions? Blockchain technology provides inherent security through cryptographic verification and decentralized record-keeping. Additionally, as a regulated financial institution, Hana Financial will implement additional security protocols compliant with financial regulations.

The widely watched Crypto Fear & Greed Index has taken another dip, falling to a reading of 26. This move deeper into ‘Fear’ territory signals a significant shift in market psychology. But what does this number truly mean for your portfolio, and is it a warning sign or a potential opportunity? Let’s decode the sentiment. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Telling Us Now? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a crucial barometer for market emotion. It operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 means ‘Extreme Fear,’ while 100 signals ‘Extreme Greed.’ The recent drop to 26 is a clear indicator that fear, not optimism, is the dominant force driving trader decisions. This index isn’t just a feeling; it’s a data-driven composite. It analyzes: Volatility (25%) : Sharp price swings often correlate with panic. Market Volume (25%) : High volume during downturns can indicate selling pressure. Social Media (15%) : The tone and volume of conversations on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%) : Direct sentiment polls from the community. Bitcoin Dominance (10%) : A flight to Bitcoin often signals risk-off behavior. Google Trends (10%) : Search interest for terms like ‘Bitcoin crash’. Why Should You Care About Market Sentiment? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is vital because markets are driven by human psychology as much as fundamentals. Extreme fear can lead to panic selling, creating potential buying opportunities for contrarian investors. Conversely, extreme greed often precedes market tops. The current ‘Fear’ phase suggests that many investors are reacting emotionally, which can lead to mispriced assets. However, it’s not a standalone trading signal. You must combine it with technical analysis and fundamental research. How Can You Use This Information Wisely? A low Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading is a call for caution, not necessarily inaction. Here are some actionable insights: Review Your Strategy : Is your portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance? Fearful markets test your long-term conviction. Avoid Emotional Decisions : The index highlights crowd psychology. Use it as a reminder to stick to your plan, not follow the herd. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) : For long-term believers, periods of fear can be a time to systematically accumulate assets at lower prices. Conduct Thorough Research : Look beyond sentiment. What are the on-chain metrics and project developments saying? Is This a Repeat of Past Crypto Winters? While a Crypto Fear & Greed Index of 26 evokes memories of deeper bear markets, context is key. Previous crypto winters saw the index plunge into single digits (‘Extreme Fear’). The current reading indicates significant worry but not yet the absolute despair seen at major bottoms. Market structure, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic factors are different today. Therefore, treat this as a valuable data point in a larger puzzle, not a definitive prophecy of a prolonged downturn. Conclusion: Navigating the Fear The drop in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 26 is a stark reminder that cryptocurrency markets are volatile and emotionally charged. It serves as a useful tool for gauging the market’s temperature and preventing you from making decisions based solely on hype or panic. The most successful investors often practice disciplined detachment, using tools like this index to understand the crowd, not join it. Remember, the transition from fear to greed is where significant opportunities are often born. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Who creates the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A: The index is provided by a company called Alternative.me. It has become a standard reference for sentiment in the crypto industry. Q: How often is the index updated? A: The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is updated daily, providing a near real-time pulse on market sentiment. Q: Is a ‘Fear’ reading always bad for prices? A: Not necessarily. While it often coincides with price declines, historically, prolonged periods of fear have sometimes marked accumulation zones before major rallies. Q: Should I sell all my crypto when the index shows ‘Fear’? A> No. The index is a sentiment indicator, not a direct trading signal. A fear reading could indicate a potential buying opportunity for long-term investors, depending on their strategy and risk assessment. Q: Does the index apply to all cryptocurrencies or just Bitcoin? A: While its components are heavily influenced by Bitcoin (like dominance and search volume), it is widely used as a proxy for overall cryptocurrency market sentiment. Q: Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index score? A> You can find it on the Alternative.me website or on many major cryptocurrency data and news platforms.

Crypto enthusiasts today are navigating a turbulent market where even big names like Bitcoin and Ethereum experience sudden dips and surges. According to recent news, Bitcoin price fell as much as 8% on Monday, dragging crypto-related stocks down, raising questions about a year-end rally despite expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut.

Bitcoin Takes a Tumble: Is the Year-End Rally at Risk? Bitcoin price dropped as much as 8% on Monday, shaking crypto markets and dragging down related stocks. This sudden dip has sparked doubts about a potential year-end rally, even as investors anticipate a Federal Reserve interest rate cut.

55323705,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=228281,1764814811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Bottom: Why Experts Warn It’s Too Early to Call the Market Floor,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-bottom-too-early-confirm/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Bottom: Why Experts Warn It’s Too Early to Call the Market Floor Is the Bitcoin bottom finally here? Many traders have been asking this question as cryptocurrency markets continue their volatile dance. However, prominent analyst Ted Pillows delivers a sobering message: it’s still too early to confirm a Bitcoin bottom. The market remains in a precarious position without clear support levels, creating what Pillows describes as a “high-risk, high-volatility phase” that demands careful navigation. Why Is It Too Early to Confirm a Bitcoin Bottom? According to Ted Pillows’ recent analysis on X, the cryptocurrency has failed to establish clear support after breaking through several key levels. The asset successively fell below $100,000, $95,000, and $90,000, wiping out initial optimism about a market floor. This pattern suggests that what some traders initially called a Bitcoin bottom might have been premature. Pillows emphasizes that Bitcoin currently trades in a directionless range without distinct upward momentum. The bearish trend that began on October 10 continues to influence market psychology, making it dangerous to assume we’ve reached the ultimate Bitcoin bottom. This uncertainty creates challenging conditions for both short-term traders and long-term investors. What Are the Key Warning Signs? Several factors indicate it might be premature to declare a definitive Bitcoin bottom. First, the lack of clear support levels means there’s no solid foundation for price recovery. When markets can’t find stable footing, they often experience continued volatility and potential further declines. Second, Pillows notes the absence of distinct upward momentum. A genuine market bottom typically shows signs of accumulation and gradual recovery, but current conditions suggest otherwise. The analyst highlights three critical observations: Broken support levels at $100K, $95K, and $90K Directionless trading range without clear trend High volatility increasing risk for all market participants How Should Traders Approach This Market? Given the uncertainty about whether we’ve reached a Bitcoin bottom, Pillows advises extreme caution. The current phase represents what seasoned traders call a “no man’s land” – a period where clear signals are scarce and false breakouts common. This environment requires different strategies than trending markets. Traders should consider several approaches during this uncertain period. First, reduce position sizes to manage risk effectively. Second, wait for clearer confirmation before making significant commitments. Third, focus on preserving capital rather than chasing uncertain opportunities. Remember, protecting your portfolio during uncertain times is often more important than maximizing gains during clear trends. What Could Signal a Real Bitcoin Bottom? While it’s too early to confirm a Bitcoin bottom currently, traders should watch for specific signals that might indicate a genuine market turn. These include the establishment of clear support levels that hold through multiple tests, increasing volume on upward moves, and improving market structure on longer timeframes. A true Bitcoin bottom typically forms with specific characteristics that differ from temporary pauses in a downtrend. Look for these potential signs: Sustained support at a specific price level Reduced volatility during declines Increasing buying pressure at lower levels Positive divergence in key technical indicators The Psychological Aspect of Market Bottoms Market bottoms involve more than just price action – they’re psychological events. When investors become excessively pessimistic and selling pressure exhausts itself, genuine bottoms can form. However, Pillows suggests we might not have reached this psychological extreme yet. The fact that some traders still believe we’ve found a Bitcoin bottom might actually indicate more pain could come. True market bottoms often arrive when few people are looking for them and when optimism has been thoroughly crushed. The current environment still shows pockets of hope and premature bottom-calling, suggesting the psychological reset might not be complete. This makes declaring a definitive Bitcoin bottom particularly risky at this juncture. Conclusion: Patience Over Premature Conclusions The search for a Bitcoin bottom continues, but according to Ted Pillows’ analysis, confirmation remains elusive. The market’s failure to establish clear support, combined with ongoing bearish trends and directionless trading, suggests caution is the wisest approach. While every trader wants to catch the exact bottom, history shows that waiting for confirmation typically produces better results than premature commitments. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, remember that sustainable bottoms build over time with clear technical and psychological signals. Until those signals appear, maintaining a defensive posture might be the most prudent strategy. The potential Bitcoin bottom will reveal itself through price action and market structure – not through hopeful predictions. Frequently Asked Questions What does “Bitcoin bottom” mean? A Bitcoin bottom refers to the lowest price point in a market cycle before prices begin a sustained upward movement. It represents the point where selling pressure exhausts itself and buying interest returns. Why is Ted Pillows saying it’s too early to confirm a bottom? Pillows points to several factors: Bitcoin has broken through multiple support levels without establishing new ones, trades in a directionless range, and shows no distinct upward momentum since the bearish trend began October 10. What price levels did Bitcoin break through recently? According to the analysis, Bitcoin successively broke below key support levels at $100,000, $95,000, and $90,000, eliminating what some traders initially thought might be a market floor. How should traders approach the current market? Pillows advises extreme caution, describing this as a high-risk, high-volatility phase. Traders should reduce position sizes, wait for clearer signals, and focus on capital preservation rather than aggressive positioning. What signals should I watch for a potential bottom? Look for established support levels that hold through multiple tests, increasing volume on upward moves, reduced volatility during declines, and positive divergence in technical indicators. How long do market bottoms typically take to form? Genuine market bottoms often develop over weeks or months, not days. They require both technical confirmation and psychological reset among market participants. Found this analysis helpful?

According to live data from Bitcoin World, Bitcoin is currently trading at $94,077.71 on the Binance USDT market. This remarkable rally is capturing the attention of investors worldwide and signaling a potentially powerful new phase for the flagship cryptocurrency. What’s Driving the Remarkable BTC Price Rally? The surge past $94,000 isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several key factors are converging to fuel this upward momentum. First, increasing institutional adoption is providing a solid foundation of demand. Moreover, recent macroeconomic developments, such as shifting monetary policy expectations, are making hard assets like Bitcoin more attractive to a broader audience. Therefore, this price movement reflects a growing consensus about Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. The market is responding to a combination of scarcity, utility, and its evolving role as a digital store of value. Key Levels and Market Sentiment for Bitcoin Breaking through the $94,000 level is a major psychological milestone. Traders often watch these round numbers closely. The current BTC price action suggests strong bullish sentiment, but what should investors watch next? Resistance and Support: The next key resistance level to watch is around $95,500. On the downside, $92,000 now acts as a crucial support zone. Trading Volume: Sustained high volume confirms the strength of this move and differentiates it from a short-lived spike. Market Dominance: Bitcoin’s rising dominance often leads the overall crypto market, setting the tone for altcoins. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors When the BTC price makes such a decisive move, it’s crucial to have a plan. Here are some practical considerations. First, avoid making decisions based solely on emotion or fear of missing out. A disciplined strategy is your best ally in a volatile market. Consider these steps: Review Your Portfolio: Ensure your allocation to Bitcoin aligns with your overall risk tolerance and investment goals. Dollar-Cost Average (DCA): If you are adding exposure, consider using a DCA strategy to mitigate timing risk. Secure Your Assets: Ensure your Bitcoin is stored securely in a non-custodial wallet if you are holding for the long term. The Road Ahead for the BTC Price While celebrating the current BTC price achievement is exciting, the future path remains dynamic. Key developments to monitor include regulatory clarity from major economies and the continued integration of Bitcoin into traditional finance. Furthermore, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event will continue to be a central narrative, reinforcing its scarcity. Ultimately, this surge above $94,000 reinforces Bitcoin’s resilience and its growing acceptance. However, investors should prepare for continued volatility as the market digests this rapid appreciation and searches for a new equilibrium.

It demonstrates the asset’s capacity for powerful growth and its increasing maturity within the global financial landscape. This BTC price movement is more than just a number; it’s a testament to the enduring belief in a decentralized financial future. For savvy investors, it’s a reminder of the importance of staying informed, staying secure, and focusing on long-term fundamentals amidst short-term price fluctuations.

The rally is driven by a combination of factors including increased institutional investment, positive macroeconomic shifts favoring hard assets, and growing mainstream adoption, all converging to create strong buying pressure. Is it too late to buy Bitcoin at $94,000? While timing the market is difficult, many investors use strategies like dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to build a position over time, regardless of price, focusing on long-term potential rather than short-term entry points.

In a major move blending sports, finance, and digital assets, sports merchandise giant Fanatics has teamed up with crypto exchange leader Crypto.com to launch Fanatics Markets . This new prediction market platform lets users trade on the outcomes of real-world events, marking a significant evolution in how we engage with sports and markets. What is the Fanatics and Crypto.com Prediction Market Platform? Simply put, a prediction market allows people to buy and sell “shares” in the outcome of future events. Think of it like a stock market for predictions. Fanatics Markets, powered by Crypto.com’s technology, is launching this concept to a massive audience. Initially, the platform focuses on events in four core areas: Sports: From game winners to player performance. Finance & Economics: Including interest rate decisions or inflation reports. Politics: Such as election results or policy outcomes. The platform is live starting today in 10 U.S. states, including California, Texas, and Florida, with a rapid app rollout planned for 24 states. Why is This Partnership a Big Deal? This collaboration is powerful because it merges two distinct worlds. Fanatics brings an unparalleled sports fanbase and brand trust, while Crypto.com contributes deep expertise in secure, high-volume digital trading. Together, they create a trusted and accessible prediction market platform . This move signals a growing mainstream acceptance of prediction markets, not as niche gambling tools, but as legitimate platforms for gauging collective intelligence and hedging opinions. What’s Next for Fanatics Markets? The initial launch is just the beginning. The companies have announced ambitious expansion plans for early next year. The prediction market platform is set to broaden its horizons significantly to include: Cryptocurrency price movements Stock market fluctuations Pop culture and entertainment events, including movies and awards shows This expansion could fundamentally change how fans interact with their passions, allowing them to financially engage with everything from a new album drop to a superhero movie’s opening weekend box office. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities? Launching a new prediction market platform in the U.S. is not without hurdles. The regulatory landscape for prediction markets is complex and varies by state, which explains the phased geographic rollout. However, the opportunity is immense. By starting with sports—a domain with a clear, established fanbase—Fanatics Markets can build user familiarity before introducing more complex financial and crypto-based predictions. This strategy could onboard millions to the concepts of decentralized finance and collective forecasting. Conclusion: A New Arena for Fan Engagement The launch of Fanatics Markets is more than a new app; it’s a glimpse into a future where fandom and financial participation merge. This prediction market platform democratizes access to trading on future events, turning every fan into a potential analyst. As it expands into crypto and stocks, it could become a major gateway for traditional sports enthusiasts to enter the digital asset space. The game is changing, and the playing field is now any event you can predict. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: How is a prediction market different from sports betting? A: While both involve predicting outcomes, prediction markets often focus on a wider range of events (like finance or politics) and function more like a trading exchange where prices fluctuate based on demand, rather than offering fixed odds. Q: Is the Fanatics Markets platform available everywhere? A: Not yet. It is currently available in 10 U.S. states, with plans to expand to 24 states via its mobile app in the coming days. Availability depends on local regulations. Q: Will I need cryptocurrency to use Fanatics Markets? A: Specific payment methods haven’t been fully detailed, but given Crypto.com’s involvement, it’s likely the platform will support both traditional and crypto payments. Q: What kind of crypto predictions will be available? A: While specifics are coming early next year, users can likely expect markets on major cryptocurrency price movements, adoption milestones, or protocol upgrade outcomes. Q: Is my money safe on this prediction market platform? A: The partnership with an established, regulated entity like Crypto.com suggests a strong focus on security and compliance, which should provide a layer of trust for users. Q: Can I use this for investment purposes? A> Prediction markets are primarily for trading on event outcomes. They can reflect market sentiment, but they carry high risk and should not be considered a traditional investment vehicle.

Imagine a one-year-old company with modest revenue securing a $415 million valuation through a $90 million Series A round. This isn’t fantasy—it’s the reality for DualEntry, an AI enterprise resource planning startup, and it represents a fundamental shift in how top-tier VCs are placing their bets. The strategy? Deploy massive capital early to create market winners through sheer financial force, a tactic known as ‘kingmaking.’ For cryptocurrency investors watching from the sidelines, this aggressive funding approach reveals how traditional venture capital is adapting to the AI revolution, creating both unprecedented opportunities and significant risks in the startup ecosystem. What Is the Kingmaking Strategy in Venture Capital? The kingmaking strategy involves venture capital firms deploying unusually large funding rounds into selected startups at early stages, aiming to overwhelm competitors by creating an insurmountable bank-account advantage. This approach isn’t entirely new—what’s changed is the timing. Jeremy Kaufmann, a partner at Scale Venture Partners, explains: ‘Venture capitalists have always evaluated competitors and bet on who they think will win a category. What’s different is that it’s happening much earlier.’ Consider these key characteristics of kingmaking: Early Stage Deployment: Massive funding at Series A or B rounds rather than later stages Category Selection: Focus on AI application categories with clear market potential Valuation Disconnect: Funding amounts that far exceed traditional revenue multiples Competitive Pressure: Designed to create market dominance through financial superiority AI Startups: The Primary Targets of Kingmaking The AI startup landscape has become the primary battleground for this strategy. DualEntry’s $90 million Series A at a $415 million valuation, despite reportedly having annual recurring revenue around $400,000, exemplifies this trend. The company’s co-founder, Nestares, disputes that revenue figure, stating it was ‘considerably higher’ when the deal closed, but even optimistic estimates show a significant valuation-to-revenue multiple. This pattern extends beyond DualEntry. The AI ERP category has seen multiple startups raising substantial back-to-back rounds: Company Funding Round Amount Timeline Rillet Series B $70 million August 2025 Rillet Series A $25 million June 2025 Campfire AI Series B $65 million October 2025 Campfire AI Series A $35 million August 2025 Jaya Gupta, a partner at Foundation Capital, noted on X: ‘There’s no new data between rounds. Series Bs happen 27-60 days after Series As regularly.’ This rapid succession funding occurs across multiple AI application categories, including IT service management and SOC compliance. How Early Funding Creates Market Advantages Why would venture capital firms deploy such substantial capital to early-stage companies with limited revenue? The strategy offers several potential advantages that extend beyond traditional growth funding: Market Perception: Well-funded startups appear more stable to enterprise buyers, making them preferred vendors for significant software purchases Talent Acquisition: Substantial funding allows startups to attract top engineering and executive talent Customer Confidence: Large war chests signal long-term viability, crucial for enterprise sales cycles Competitive Barrier: The financial advantage can deter competitors and potential market entrants David Peterson, partner at Angular Ventures, contrasts this with previous cycles: ‘The 2010s version of this was just called ‘capital as a weapon.’ He points to Uber and Lyft as canonical examples, but notes that for those companies, ‘the capital weaponization didn’t begin until they reached their Series C or D rounds.’ The Risks and Rewards of Kingmaking for ERP Software The kingmaking strategy carries significant risks alongside its potential rewards. For ERP software startups specifically, the approach creates both opportunities and challenges: Potential Benefits: Accelerated market penetration against established players like Oracle NetSuite Ability to invest heavily in product development and customer acquisition Enhanced credibility with enterprise customers wary of startup stability Significant Risks: Valuation bubbles that may collapse if growth expectations aren’t met Pressure to justify massive valuations with rapid revenue growth Potential for market consolidation that leaves few survivors History offers cautionary tales. Notable failures like logistics company Convoy and the bankruptcy reorganization of scooter company Bird demonstrate that massive capitalization offers no guarantee of success. Yet major VC firms continue this approach, driven by what Peterson describes as the ‘fully internalized lesson of the power law.’ Why Venture Capital Firms Embrace This High-Stakes Approach Despite the risks, several factors drive venture capital firms toward kingmaking strategies in AI sectors: Market Timing: AI represents a transformative technology shift comparable to mobile or cloud computing Competitive Dynamics: Multiple well-funded startups in the same category create winner-take-most dynamics FOMO Psychology: Fear of missing out on the next Uber or Airbnb of AI Portfolio Strategy: Willingness to accept high failure rates for potential outsized returns As one VC who declined to invest in DualEntry told Bitcoin World, the disconnect between valuation and revenue has become increasingly common. This reflects a broader shift in how venture capital evaluates early-stage opportunities in transformative technology categories. FAQs: Understanding the Kingmaking Phenomenon What companies are using the kingmaking strategy? Several venture capital firms are employing this approach, including Lightspeed Venture Partners , Khosla Ventures , Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) , and Sequoia Capital . These firms are backing AI startups like DualEntry , Rillet, and Campfire AI with unusually large early-stage rounds. Who are the key people mentioned in this strategy? Key figures include Jeremy Kaufmann of Scale Venture Partners , David Peterson of Angular Ventures , and Jaya Gupta of Foundation Capital . These investors have observed and participated in the shifting funding patterns. How does this affect the broader AI startup ecosystem? The kingmaking strategy creates both opportunities and challenges. It provides selected startups with resources to accelerate growth but may create valuation bubbles and increase competitive pressure on unfunded or underfunded competitors. What historical precedents exist for this approach? Previous examples include the ridesharing wars between Uber and Lyft , where massive late-stage funding created competitive advantages. The key difference today is how early in company development this strategy is being deployed. Are there successful examples of kingmaking? While it’s too early to judge current AI startups, historical examples like Uber demonstrate how substantial funding can create market dominance. However, failures like Convoy and Bird show the risks of overcapitalization without sustainable business models. Conclusion: The Future of Venture Capital in the AI Era The kingmaking strategy represents a fundamental evolution in how venture capital approaches transformative technology opportunities. By deploying massive funding at earlier stages, VCs aim to create market winners through financial force rather than organic growth. This approach carries significant risks—including potential valuation bubbles and high-profile failures—but reflects the venture community’s belief in AI’s transformative potential and the lessons learned from previous technology cycles. For cryptocurrency investors and observers, this trend offers insights into how traditional venture capital is adapting to rapid technological change. The aggressive funding of AI startups parallels certain patterns seen in crypto venture investing, though with different risk profiles and market dynamics. As AI continues to reshape enterprise software and other sectors, the kingmaking strategy will likely produce both spectacular successes and notable failures, ultimately testing whether early financial advantage can reliably create lasting market leadership.

The platform has announced essential Bitcoin World system maintenance scheduled for December 3rd. This temporary service pause represents a commitment to improvement, not an interruption. Let’s explore what this means for you and why it matters for your cryptocurrency journey. When is the Bitcoin World system maintenance happening? The Bitcoin World system maintenance window is clearly defined to minimize user disruption. The team will conduct this essential work from 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. UTC on December 3 . This two-hour period is strategically chosen during lower global traffic hours. Therefore, the impact on most users should be minimal. The platform apologizes for any inconvenience and emphasizes that this work will lead to an improved service experience. What services will be unavailable during the maintenance? Understanding the scope of the outage helps you plan accordingly. During the Bitcoin World system maintenance period, one core service will be temporarily suspended. Real-time Investment Information Services: All live price feeds, market data updates, and real-time analytics will be paused. However, it’s crucial to note what will not be affected. User accounts, historical data, and the main website infrastructure will remain accessible. This targeted approach shows the maintenance is a focused upgrade, not a full platform shutdown. Why is this Bitcoin World maintenance necessary? Regular maintenance is the backbone of any reliable digital platform. For a service like Bitcoin World, which handles volatile, real-time financial data, these updates are non-negotiable. This Bitcoin World system maintenance likely aims to implement backend improvements that users will benefit from later. These upgrades can include: Enhanced Server Infrastructure: For faster data processing and reduced latency. Security Patches: To protect user data and ensure platform integrity. New Feature Integration: Laying the groundwork for future tools and analytics. Proactive maintenance prevents unexpected downtime and builds a more robust service, ultimately protecting your access to critical information. How should you prepare as a user?

Plan Your Research: If you need live data for analysis, complete it before 8:00 PM UTC on Dec 3. Use Alternative Sources Temporarily: Bookmark other reputable crypto data sites to check prices during the short window if absolutely necessary. Set Price Alerts Elsewhere: For active traders, set up alerts on your exchange or wallet app for the maintenance period. Remember, this is a brief, scheduled pause. The long-term benefit of a more stable and feature-rich Bitcoin World platform far outweighs this short-term inconvenience. What can you expect after the maintenance? The promise of an “improved service” is the key takeaway. Once the Bitcoin World system maintenance is complete, you should return to a platform that is faster, more secure, and potentially more feature-rich. Look for subtle improvements in page load times, data refresh rates, and overall platform stability. These behind-the-scenes upgrades are what allow trusted crypto information hubs to remain reliable in a fast-paced market. Conclusion: A Necessary Step Forward The scheduled Bitcoin World system maintenance on December 3rd is a sign of a healthy, evolving platform. It demonstrates a commitment to technical excellence and user experience.

According to real-time data from Binance’s USDT trading pair, BTC is currently trading at $93,012.08. This significant milestone marks a pivotal moment for investors and signals renewed bullish momentum in the market. But what’s fueling this impressive Bitcoin price surge , and is this rally built to last? What’s Driving the Current Bitcoin Price Surge? Several key factors often converge to create such powerful upward movements. First, increased institutional adoption continues to provide a solid foundation of demand. Major financial firms are not just holding Bitcoin but actively integrating it into their investment products. Secondly, macroeconomic conditions, such as concerns about inflation or currency devaluation, can drive investors towards Bitcoin as a perceived store of value. Finally, market sentiment and technical breakthroughs, like surpassing a major resistance level, can trigger a wave of buying from both retail and algorithmic traders. Breaking Down the $93,000 Milestone Crossing the $93,000 mark is more than just a number; it’s a strong psychological signal. This level often acts as a key resistance point. When Bitcoin breaks above it with conviction, as seen in the current trading data, it suggests that buying pressure is overwhelming selling pressure. For traders, this can indicate a potential continuation of the trend. However, it’s crucial to remember that cryptocurrency markets are volatile. Key levels to watch now include: Support: The previous resistance near $90,000 may now act as a new support zone. Resistance: The next major psychological hurdle is likely the $95,000 or even $100,000 level. Volume: Sustained high trading volume confirms the strength of the move. How Should Investors Navigate This Rally? While a major Bitcoin price surge is exciting, it requires a strategic approach. For long-term holders, this may reinforce their conviction, but they should avoid making emotional decisions based on short-term spikes. For active traders, understanding market structure and having a clear risk management plan is non-negotiable. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and consider using tools like stop-loss orders to protect your capital. Diversification across different asset classes, even within crypto, remains a cornerstone of prudent investing. The Bigger Picture: What Does This Mean for Crypto? Bitcoin often acts as a bellwether for the broader digital asset ecosystem. A strong Bitcoin price surge typically generates positive sentiment that can spill over into altcoins. This can lead to increased trading activity and development across the entire space. Furthermore, such prominent price action attracts media attention, potentially drawing new users and capital into the cryptocurrency market. It validates the growing narrative of Bitcoin as a mature financial asset class. In conclusion, Bitcoin’s ascent above $93,000 is a testament to its enduring resilience and growing adoption. This Bitcoin price surge highlights the asset’s potential for significant growth, driven by a complex mix of institutional interest, macroeconomic factors, and market dynamics. While the journey will undoubtedly include volatility, this milestone reinforces Bitcoin’s position at the forefront of the financial revolution. The key for participants is to stay informed, manage risk diligently, and focus on the long-term technological transformation rather than daily price fluctuations. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why did Bitcoin suddenly rise above $93,000? A: Price movements are rarely due to a single cause. This surge is likely a combination of positive institutional news flows, favorable macroeconomic signals, and technical buying pressure after breaking key resistance levels. Q2: Is it too late to buy Bitcoin after this surge? A: “Timing the market” is extremely difficult. Many investors use a strategy called dollar-cost averaging (DCA), investing a fixed amount regularly regardless of price, to mitigate the risk of buying at a peak. Q3: Could the price drop back down just as quickly? A> Yes, cryptocurrency is known for its volatility. Sharp rallies can be followed by corrections. This is why risk management and a long-term perspective are essential. Q4: Does Bitcoin’s rise mean altcoins will also go up? A: Often, but not always. A strong Bitcoin can lift the entire market, but each altcoin has its own fundamentals. This period is sometimes called “altcoin season” if capital rotates from Bitcoin into smaller-cap assets. Q5: Where can I safely track the Bitcoin price? A> Reputable cryptocurrency data aggregators and major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken provide real-time price information. Always use trusted sources. Q6: What’s the next major target if Bitcoin holds above $93,000? A: The next significant psychological and technical resistance levels are widely seen at $95,000 and the historic $100,000 mark, which would be a monumental achievement for the network.

The Franklin Templeton SOL ETF has officially begun trading on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol SOEZ. This isn’t just another fund launch; it’s a powerful validation of Solana’s blockchain technology and a clear signal that institutional demand for crypto exposure is moving beyond Bitcoin. For investors, this moment unlocks a familiar, regulated pathway to gain exposure to one of cryptocurrency’s most dynamic assets. What Does the Franklin Templeton SOL ETF Mean for Investors? The launch of the Franklin Templeton SOL ETF represents a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset world. Franklin Templeton, a global investment giant with over $1.6 trillion in assets, is providing a crucial service: regulated, accessible exposure to Solana’s native token, SOL. Therefore, investors no longer need to navigate crypto exchanges or manage private keys. Instead, they can buy and sell shares of SOEZ through their standard brokerage accounts, just like they would with any stock or traditional ETF. This move significantly de-risks the process for mainstream and institutional players. Key benefits include: Regulatory Oversight: The ETF operates within the established U.S. regulatory framework, offering a layer of security and compliance unfamiliar to direct crypto holdings. Custody & Security: Franklin Templeton handles the complex custody of the underlying SOL assets, mitigating the risk of theft or loss that individuals face. Tax Simplicity: Investments are integrated into existing tax reporting structures, simplifying the often-confusing crypto tax landscape. Liquidity & Accessibility: Trading on the NYSE Arca ensures high liquidity and makes the fund available to a vast pool of retail and institutional investors. Why Is This Launch a Game-Changer for Solana? Beyond investor convenience, the approval and listing of the Franklin Templeton SOL ETF serve as a monumental endorsement for the Solana network itself. Regulatory bodies do not greenlight products tied to assets they deem unsecure or fraudulent. This launch, therefore, signals a growing institutional confidence in Solana’s underlying technology, its developer ecosystem, and its long-term viability. Moreover, it creates a powerful, circular flywheel effect. Increased investment through the ETF can boost SOL’s market profile and liquidity. This, in turn, can attract more developers and projects to build on Solana, enhancing its utility and value. The ETF acts as a formal on-ramp for billions in traditional capital that has been waiting for a secure entry point. What Challenges and Considerations Should You Know? While this is a landmark achievement, savvy investors should approach with clear eyes. First, this is a spot ETF, meaning it directly holds SOL, but it’s crucial to understand the associated fees and structure, which Franklin Templeton will disclose. Second, investing in a single-asset crypto ETF like SOEZ carries concentrated risk. Your investment’s performance is tied directly to SOL’s price movements, which can be highly volatile compared to a diversified portfolio. Furthermore, the crypto regulatory environment remains in flux. While this ETF’s approval is positive, broader regulations could impact the sector. Always consider your own risk tolerance and conduct thorough research, viewing crypto exposure as a strategic portion of a broader investment plan rather than a core holding. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Crypto Adoption The debut of the Franklin Templeton SOL ETF on the NYSE Arca is more than a new ticker symbol. It is a definitive step toward the maturation and institutionalization of the cryptocurrency market. By offering a familiar, regulated vehicle, Franklin Templeton has effectively lowered the barrier for millions to participate in Solana’s growth story. This launch validates the asset, educates the mainstream, and paves the way for the next wave of financial innovation. The gates are now officially open. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the ticker symbol for the Franklin Templeton SOL ETF? The ETF trades on the NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol SOEZ . How is this different from buying SOL directly on a crypto exchange? Buying the ETF through a brokerage account means you own shares in a fund that holds SOL, not the cryptocurrency itself. You avoid the complexities of digital wallets, private keys, and crypto-native exchanges. Does this ETF pay dividends? Typically, spot cryptocurrency ETFs do not pay dividends as the underlying assets (like SOL) do not generate dividend income. Any returns are based on changes in the NAV (Net Asset Value) of the fund. What are the risks of investing in the SOL ETF? The primary risks mirror those of holding SOL directly: high price volatility, regulatory changes impacting crypto, and technology risks associated with the Solana blockchain. The ETF itself also charges a management fee. Can I hold this ETF in my IRA or 401(k)? Yes, since it trades on a major stock exchange, shares of the SOEZ ETF can typically be held in traditional retirement accounts, depending on your plan’s specific rules. Is this the first Solana ETF? In the United States, this is among the first spot Solana ETFs to receive regulatory approval and list on a major national exchange, marking a significant first.

On one side, meme-coins, often subject to fleeting hype cycles and sudden crashes, see confidence erode after repeated sell-offs. On the other, a structured sector is attracting capital and attention in a growing manner: that of tokenized real-world assets (RWA). This is not a passing trend. It is a reallocation of capital toward projects with economic fundamentals, verifiable cash flows, and a clear business model. In this context, a proposal like RentStac (RNS) does not promise fortunes based on a viral tweet but builds an investment thesis on a solid pillar: the global rental real estate market. The Context: Why Capital is Changing Course Investors, especially after recent turbulence, show fatigue with pure speculation. They seek resilience. The answer comes from RWA models, which anchor a token’s value to physical assets and existing income contracts. The entry of giants like BlackRock and central banks’ experimentation with digital bonds are powerful signals of validation for the entire category. While meme-coins live and die with market sentiment, RWA projects operate on a different time horizon. Their value is tied to the performance of a real asset, its ability to generate revenue, and the transparency with which it is distributed. It’s a paradigm shift: from betting to investing. RentStac (RNS): A Concrete Model, Not a Slogan RentStac embodies precisely this paradigm shift. It is not based on a community waiting for a “pump,” but on a transparent and replicable operational mechanism. Here’s how it works, according to its public documentation: Real Legal Ownership: Each property is held by a dedicated Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV). The SPV holds the legal title, offering clear legal separation between the asset and the platform. Fractional and Democratized Ownership: Rights to the SPV are tokenized. This allows anyone, with a few hundred dollars, to own a fraction of a residential or commercial property, an asset traditionally reserved for large capital. Automated Cash Flow: Smart contracts manage the collection of rental payments and their proportional redistribution to token holders. The investor does not have to trust promises but can verify the flows on the blockchain. Defined Roles: The system recognizes three figures: the Investor (the token owner), the Manager (who handles the operational management of the property), and the Validator (who ensures the integrity of on-chain operations). This is not an abstract idea, but a practical application of blockchain to solve a real problem: the illiquid, high-minimum-capital access to the real estate market. What Investors Are Looking for Today (And What They Find Here) After the experience with purely speculative assets, the market demand is clear: Transparency: Where does my money go? With RentStac, the asset is identifiable and the income stream is traceable on-chain. Fundamentals: What supports the value of this token? Not the next influencer, but the lease contracts of real properties. Passive Cash Flow: Can I generate yield without having to sell the asset? The model is designed precisely to distribute rental income. Protection from Extreme Volatility: While the token price may fluctuate, its intrinsic value is anchored to an asset whose price does not go to zero overnight. RentStac responds directly to these needs. It does not promise to “go to the moon” overnight but to build a path of value over time, brick by brick. The RNS Presale: An Early Entry Opportunity The project has initiated a public presale for its native token, RNS (total supply: 2 billion), at a price of $0.025 USD . This phase allows entry into the project before its debut on major exchanges, a traditionally catalytic moment for visibility and liquidity. An investment at this stage is not a bet on a meme but an early-stage participation in infrastructure aiming to democratize a multi-trillion dollar market. It is a calculation based on the future adoption of the model, the growth of the real estate portfolio, and the demand for real, stable yields in the crypto world. Conclusion: Beyond the Noise, Toward Substance The market is maturing. The phase where any token with a dog as a mascote could soar is giving way to a more sober evaluation of value propositions. While meme-coins sink under the weight of their lack of substance, the real opportunity for 2026 and beyond is crystallizing around protocols that do the heavy lifting: integrating the real world into the blockchain, creating utility, efficiency, and, above all, real and sustainable profit opportunities. RentStac (RNS) is not just another token in a sea of proposals. It is a concrete example of where the future of digital finance is headed: toward assets that not only have a market price but also generate income. For the investor seeking substance beyond the noise, delving into this project may not only be interesting but necessary.

According to a stunning new report from financial titan BlackRock, that future is closer than you think. The world’s largest asset manager has made a bold prediction: we will see accelerated Bitcoin adoption by 2026, driven by profound shifts in the global economic landscape. This isn’t just speculation from crypto enthusiasts; it’s a forecast from a $10 trillion institution that shapes global markets. Why Does BlackRock Predict Accelerated Bitcoin Adoption? BlackRock’s 2026 outlook points directly to two massive, interconnected forces: growing U.S. economic vulnerability and a federal debt expected to surpass $38 trillion. The firm suggests that these traditional financial pressures will push investors and institutions toward alternative stores of value. Therefore, digital assets like Bitcoin are poised to move from the fringe to the financial mainstream. This projection signals a fundamental change in how major players view cryptocurrency—not as a speculative toy, but as a necessary component of a modern portfolio. The Driving Forces Behind the Shift What specific factors are catalyzing this change? BlackRock’s analysis highlights a perfect storm. Mounting Sovereign Debt: The staggering $38 trillion U.S. debt figure creates concerns about currency devaluation and inflation, making hard-capped assets like Bitcoin more attractive. Institutional Infrastructure: The approval of Bitcoin ETFs, which BlackRock itself spearheaded, has created a regulated, familiar pathway for massive capital inflows. Technological Maturation: The underlying blockchain technology has proven resilient and secure over more than a decade, building trust. Consequently, the narrative is shifting from “if” to “when and how” for widespread Bitcoin adoption . Beyond Bitcoin: Tokenization and Stablecoins as New Infrastructure BlackRock’s vision extends far beyond just Bitcoin. The report emphasizes that tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) and the rise of stablecoins will act as the critical plumbing connecting old and new financial systems. Think of tokenization as creating a digital twin for assets like bonds, real estate, or even art on a blockchain. Stablecoins, meanwhile, offer the price stability of fiat currency with the efficiency of digital transactions. Together, they form the key infrastructure that will allow traditional finance (TradFi) to seamlessly interact with the digital economy (DeFi). What Are the Practical Implications for Investors? For the average person, this forecast is more than just news—it’s a roadmap. Here are actionable insights: Education is Key: Understanding the basics of blockchain, wallets, and custody solutions is no longer optional for informed investing. Portfolio Diversification: Consider how a small, strategic allocation to digital assets might hedge against traditional market risks highlighted by BlackRock. Watch the Bridges: Pay attention to companies and projects working on tokenization and regulatory-compliant stablecoins, as they will be the enablers of this transition. However, challenges remain. Regulatory clarity, security concerns, and market volatility are significant hurdles that must be navigated for this prediction to fully materialize. The Final Verdict on Bitcoin’s Mainstream March BlackRock’s 2026 outlook is a powerful endorsement of the digital asset revolution. It reframes Bitcoin adoption not as a niche trend but as a probable response to macroeconomic fragility. By linking the move to concrete issues like national debt and identifying tokenization as the bridge, the report provides a coherent, institution-grade thesis for crypto’s future. While the path may have twists, the direction is clear: the integration of digital assets into the global financial system is accelerating. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly did BlackRock predict about Bitcoin? A1: BlackRock stated in its 2026 outlook that digital assets like Bitcoin will see wider, accelerated adoption, primarily due to concerns over U.S. economic vulnerability and its soaring national debt. Q2: Why does U.S. debt influence Bitcoin adoption? A2: High national debt can lead to fears of currency devaluation or inflation. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply of 21 million coins, is seen by many as a potential hedge against these traditional financial risks. Q3: What role do stablecoins and tokenization play? A3: BlackRock projects they will become key infrastructure. Stablecoins offer digital dollar stability for transactions, while tokenization turns real-world assets into digital tokens on a blockchain, creating a bridge between traditional and digital finance. Q4: Is BlackRock’s prediction a guarantee? A4: No, it is a forecast based on current trends. It remains subject to factors like regulatory changes, technological developments, and broader market acceptance. Q5: How can an individual prepare for this potential shift? A5: Focus on education, understand the risks and technology, and consider how digital assets might fit into a long-term, diversified investment strategy after consulting with a financial advisor. Q6: Does this mean Bitcoin will replace traditional money? A6> Not in the near term. BlackRock’s vision is one of coexistence and integration, where Bitcoin acts as a complementary asset class and blockchain technology improves the efficiency of the existing financial system.

Le framed Strategy’s balance sheet as a barbell between long-term BTC exposure and short-term cash obligations: “We have long-term strategy, which is to buy and hold bitcoin. That is our primary treasury reserve asset . And we have short-term dollar obligations created because of the dividends we have on our preferred notes.” To avoid being forced to sell BTC when the company’s equity trades close to or below the value of its underlying holdings, Strategy created a dedicated US dollar reserve: “If we want to really create a bulletproof balance sheet, let’s have the global reserve digital asset, bitcoin, for the long term, and the global reserve digital currency for the short term. That is why I created the US dollar reserve, to pay down dividends in the short term any case that we needed.” Le said Strategy recently issued equity “in 8.5 days” to pre-fund roughly 21 months of preferred dividends, and now aims to maintain a cash buffer equal to “two to three years of dividends,” a policy he expects to maintain for “the next five or 10 years” before reassessing as the capital structure evolves. He defended the company’s insistence on continuing the dividend, arguing that suspensions “create fear, uncertainty, doubt” and harm equity holders: “Our objective is to pay the dividend into perpetuity. Never say never, but I think preserving the payment of the dividend is the right thing for the short term. It is also important for the bitcoin asset class.” At the same time, he sought to defuse concerns that Strategy is overleveraged or at imminent risk of selling BTC. Le said Strategy has “12% leverage” on its debt alone and “27% leverage” including preferreds, versus “60% to 80%” at a typical US public company. If the company continues to grow its cash reserves to cover multiple years of dividends, he said, “really [we’re] talking about the end of 2028” before any realistic scenario where selling bitcoin to fund dividends might be considered. Le also pushed back against MSCI’s suggestion that “digital asset treasury” companies may resemble funds and could be excluded from indices. He argued Strategy is a “fully integrated, vertically integrated bitcoin operating company” that buys bitcoin, issues securities, creates products, generates operating income and employs full corporate staff, and therefore should trade at a premium reflecting its ability “to grow our treasury and our operating income over time.” From HODL To Considering Bitcoin Lending On lending, Le said Strategy has deliberately kept its business “very simple” so far: “We buy and we hold bitcoin.”However, that may change as traditional finance ramps up BTC offerings: “Over the course of the next year […] big, real banks will offer custody, lending service and staking and otherwise. I think when they enter that space and when they have different counterparties, it is something we would consider and be enthusiastic about.” Le added that Strategy has already had “a lot of constructive discussions” with large US banks exploring bitcoin custody, exchange and lending and is “excited to partner with them” once those platforms are fully in place.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Trail Ends: $29M Seized After European Authorities Shut Down Cryptomixer Average daily wipeouts have jumped from roughly $28 million in long bets and $15 million in shorts during the last cycle to about $68 million long and $45 million short in the current cycle, according to a new Glassnode and Fasanara report. That shift has made single sell-offs much more violent. Early Black Friday Shock Reports have disclosed that Oct. 10 was the clearest sign of the change. On that day, more than $640 million per hour in long positions were liquidated as Bitcoin plunged from $121,000 to $102,000. Open interest fell about 22% in less than 12 hours, sliding from close to $50 billion to $39 billion. Traders felt the move fast. Positions were closed out on a scale Glassnode called one of the sharpest deleveraging events in Bitcoin’s history. Futures Activity Hits Records Futures markets have swelled. Open interest climbed to a record $68 billion and daily futures turnover topped $69 billion in mid-October. Perpetual contracts now account for more than 90% of that activity, which concentrates risk in instruments that reset continuously. Average daily futures wipeouts rising to $68 million long and $45 million short shows the costs when big swings occur. Spot Trading Doubles Based on reports, spot trading has also become more active. Bitcoin’s spot volume has climbed into an $8 billion to $22 billion daily range, roughly double what was seen in the prior cycle. During the Oct. 10 crash, hourly spot volume spiked to $7.3 billion, with many traders stepping in to buy the dip rather than run for the exits. That flow has helped shift where price discovery happens. Capital Flows And Market Share Monthly inflows into Bitcoin have varied from $40 billion to $190 billion, pushing realized market capitalization to a record $1.1 trillion. Roughly $730 billion has flowed into the network since the November 2022 low — more than all previous cycles combined. As a result, Bitcoin’s share of overall crypto market cap rose from 38% in late 2022 to 58% today, based on the report’s figures.

That throughput exceeded what major card networks handled in the same window. This has been cited as a reason some participants view Bitcoin not just as a store of value, but as an increasingly important settlement rail.

This latest failure marks a crucial moment in the ongoing battle between federal preemption and state-level innovation in technology governance. For those following regulatory trends that could impact blockchain and AI integration, this decision signals continued complexity in the legal landscape. What Happened with the Latest AI Regulation Block Attempt? The most recent effort to insert a ban on state AI regulation into the annual defense bill has been rejected after facing bipartisan opposition. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise confirmed that Republican leaders would seek “other places” to include the measure, which has received support from President Trump. This marks the second failure this year for such proposals, following a similar defeat when GOP lawmakers tried to include a 10-year moratorium on state AI laws in Trump’s tax and spending bill earlier in 2025. Why Does AI Regulation Matter for Technology Innovation? The debate over AI regulation centers on competing visions for technological governance. Silicon Valley companies and their supporters argue that allowing states to create their own AI regulations would result in: A confusing patchwork of rules across different jurisdictions Increased compliance costs for technology companies Potential stifling of innovation through inconsistent requirements Competitive disadvantages for companies operating in multiple states However, critics of federal preemption point out that most state AI legislation focuses on essential protections: State Focus Areas Federal Gap Consumer safety standards No comprehensive federal AI safety framework Algorithmic transparency requirements Limited federal disclosure mandates Bias prevention measures Inconsistent federal enforcement Industry-specific regulations One-size-fits-all federal approach The Political Battle Over Federal AI Policy The rejection of this provision reveals interesting political dynamics. Despite President Trump’s support for blocking state AI regulation, the measure faced resistance from both parties. Scalise acknowledged that the defense bill was not the appropriate vehicle for such a provision and echoed Trump’s previous calls to introduce the ban as separate legislation. This political maneuvering suggests that while there may be executive branch support for limiting state authority, legislative consensus remains elusive. What Government Oversight Means for AI Development The debate extends beyond simple regulatory preferences to fundamental questions about government oversight in emerging technologies. Proponents of state regulation argue that in the absence of comprehensive federal AI laws, blocking states from acting would effectively hand control to large technology companies without meaningful oversight. This concern resonates particularly in the cryptocurrency space, where similar debates about regulation versus innovation have played out for years. Future Implications for Tech Legislation The failure of this latest attempt suggests several possible developments: Separate Legislation: As Scalise indicated, supporters may pursue standalone bills rather than attaching provisions to unrelated legislation Executive Action: A leaked draft executive order suggests Trump is considering unilateral action, though these efforts have reportedly paused State Momentum: The rejection may embolden states to continue developing their own AI regulatory frameworks Industry Adaptation: Technology companies may need to prepare for diverse regulatory environments across states Actionable Insights for Technology Stakeholders For cryptocurrency projects, blockchain companies, and AI developers, this regulatory landscape offers important lessons: Monitor State Developments: Pay attention to AI regulation proposals in key technology states like California, New York, and Texas Engage in Policy Discussions: Participate in legislative processes at both state and federal levels Build Flexible Systems: Design technology architectures that can adapt to varying regulatory requirements Consider Compliance Early: Integrate regulatory considerations into product development from the beginning FAQs About the AI Regulation Battle Who is leading the effort to block state AI regulation? House Majority Leader Steve Scalise has been spearheading the legislative efforts, with support from President Donald Trump and backing from major Silicon Valley technology companies. What arguments do Silicon Valley companies make against state AI regulation? Companies like those represented by TechNet and other industry groups argue that multiple state regulations create compliance complexity that hinders innovation and gives advantage to larger companies with more legal resources. How might this affect cryptocurrency and blockchain projects? Many blockchain projects incorporate AI elements, and the regulatory uncertainty could impact development timelines, funding decisions, and geographic deployment strategies for these technologies. What happens next in the legislative process? Supporters may introduce standalone legislation, pursue other legislative vehicles, or wait for potential executive action from the Trump administration. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Technology Governance The failure to block state AI regulation represents more than just a legislative setback for certain interests. It signals a broader recognition that emerging technologies require thoughtful, multi-layered governance approaches. As with cryptocurrency regulation, the path forward for AI will likely involve both federal frameworks and state-level experimentation. This balanced approach, while complex, may ultimately produce more resilient and responsive regulatory systems that protect consumers while fostering innovation. The coming months will be crucial as both sides regroup and consider their next moves. For technology companies and observers, this ongoing battle offers valuable insights into how regulatory landscapes evolve for transformative technologies.
