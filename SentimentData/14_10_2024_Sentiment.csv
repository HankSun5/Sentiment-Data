Based on the examination of crypto expert Javon Marks, the token has recently emerged from a declining wedge formation, which may suggest that a substantial price increase is in the offing. Related Reading: Whales Hoard $90 Million In Bitcoin: A Sign Of What’s To Come? Marks estimates that SHIB might increase by 342% and reach $0.000081, a level not seen since the bull run of 2021. If current trends continue, the canine-inspired digital asset may see a significant price turnaround. Following that milestone break, the future of SHIB’s price looks promising. According to the estimations, if the token reaches $0.00001794 in mid-November 2024, there will be a 0.65% immediate price gain. The current position at a neutral 50 of the Fear & Greed Index reveals a balanced state of mind on the market and correlates well with cautious optimism regarding the change in SHIB price. Of late, in the last 30 days, SHIB has been green for half the days, 15, and that too supports further future development. $SHIB (Shiba Inu) – Are you prepared for $0.000081!? With SHIB broken out of a recent Falling Wedge pattern and a much larger (unpictured) resisting trend, an over 342% run from here to it could happen ASAP, and this falling wedge break may only help spark the process 🧨! https://t.co/wSz2eVepSp pic.twitter.com/eefYqFGg1N — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) October 11, 2024 The Power Of A Falling Wedge For the last five months, SHIB has been in a falling wedge pattern, which is a chart pattern in technical analysis that normally trends with a strong bullish reversal. As such, this particular pattern, where the lows are lower and the highs are lower, has proven to be a trigger for breakouts. In March 2024, the pattern was apparently clear, as SHIB declined from the yearly high at $0.000045. According to Marks, it may be the breakthrough that pushes the token all the way to $0.000081. Key Indicators Point To Strength Momentum may be emerging as SHIB trades around $0.00001785 with persistent higher lows. Additionally, the token’s 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) are lower than the current price, suggesting bullishness. The fact that SHIB is still trading above its 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) indicates that it is in an uptrend over the long term, despite the fact that it is trading below its 50-day SMA, which is often a bearish signal. The confluence of these indicators indicates that SHIB is stable, although it is possible for it to move farther in any direction.

Support And Resistance Levels Looking forward, Shiba Inu has important support around $0.000017; resistance at $0.000018 and $0.000019. Should the token be able to surpass these resistance thresholds, it may rapidly achieve the target anticipated at $0.000081. Meanwhile, there still is room for development, but traders and investors should continue to watch closely the activity of the price because the next steps for SHIB can validate the breakout or trigger even more consolidation. Yet considering past trends and technical hints that look hopeful, it might be just a matter of time before SHIB explodes into significant value soon.

BTC is now consolidating and might aim for more upsides above $63,000. Bitcoin is struggling to start a fresh increase above the $63,200 zone. The price is trading above $61,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a short-term declining channel forming with resistance at $63,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could regain traction if there is a close above the $63,200 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Holds Support Bitcoin price formed a base and started a fresh increase above the $61,200 resistance. BTC cleared the $62,000 resistance to move into a positive zone. The price even spiked above $63,000 before the bears appeared. A high was formed at $63,445 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the $63,000 level. There was a minor move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $58,888 swing low to the $63,445 high. Bitcoin price is now trading above $62,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $63,000 level. There is also a short-term declining channel forming with resistance at $63,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The first key resistance is near the $63,200 level. A clear move above the $63,200 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $63,500. A close above the $63,200 resistance might initiate more gains. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $64,500 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $65,000 resistance level. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $63,200 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $62,250 level. The first major support is near the $62,000 level. The next support is now near the $61,150 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $58,888 swing low to the $63,445 high. Any more losses might send the price toward the $60,000 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $62,000, followed by $61,150.

The price could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.5450 and $0.5500 resistance levels. XRP price is attempting a fresh increase above the $0.5320 support. The price is now trading above $0.5350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $0.5310 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.5450 and $0.5500 resistance levels. XRP Price Holds Key Support XRP price remained stable above the $0.5240 support. A base was formed and the price started a fresh increase above $0.5350 like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price climbed above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5430 swing high to the $0.5252 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $0.5310 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $0.5350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5390 level. It is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5430 swing high to the $0.5252 low. The first major resistance is near the $0.5400 level. The next key resistance could be $0.5450. A clear move above the $0.5450 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5500 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5680 resistance or even $0.5750 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $0.600, where the bears might emerge. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $0.540 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5340 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The next major support is near the $0.5280 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5280 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5250 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.5120 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.5340 and $0.5280.

In an analysis shared via X (formerly Twitter), Ebtikar writes, “Independent of the myriad of (probable) bad decisions that the ETH foundation & co have made there’s another structural reason why ETH has traded like a dog this cycle.” Why Is The Ethereum Price Lagging Behind? Ebtikar began by emphasizing the importance of understanding capital flows within the crypto market. He identified three primary sources of capital flow: retail investors who engage directly through platforms like Coinbase, Binance, and Bybit; private capital from liquid and venture funds; and institutional investors who invest directly through Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and futures. However, he noted that retail investors are “hardest to quantify” and are “not fully present in the market today,” thus excluding them from his analysis. Focusing on private capital, Ebtikar highlighted that in 2021, this segment was the largest capital base, driven by crypto euphoria that attracted more than $20 billion in net new inflows. “Fast forward to today, private capital is no longer the heavy hitter capital base as ETFs and other traditional vehicles have taken the role of the largest net new buyer of crypto,” he stated. He attributed this decline to a series of poor venture investments and overhang from prior cycles, which have “left a bad taste in the mouths of LPs.” These venture firms and liquid funds recognized that they couldn’t wait out another cycle and needed to be more proactive. They began taking more “shots on target” for liquid plays, often through private deals involving locked tokens such as Solana (SOL), Celestia (TIA), and Toncoin (TON). “These locked deals also represented something more interesting for a lot of firms—there’s a world outside of Ethereum-based investing that is actually growing and usable and has enough market cap growth relative to ETH that could justify the underwriting of the investment,” Ebtikar explained. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Score Signals Cooling Market Momentum – Time To Buy? He noted that investors were aware it would be increasingly difficult to raise funds for venture and liquid investments. Without the return of retail capital, institutional products became the only viable avenue for a bid for ETH. Mindshare began fragmenting as the three-year mark of the 2021 vintage approached, and products like BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) gained legitimacy as the de facto benchmark for crypto. Private capital had to make a choice: “Abandon their core portfolio hold in ETH and move down the risk curve or hold your breath for traditional players to start bailing you out.” This led to the formation of two camps. The first consisted of pre-ETF ETH sellers between January and May 2024, who opted out of ETH and swapped to assets like SOL. The second group, post-ETF ETH sellers from June to September 2024, realized that ETF flows into ETH were lackluster and that it would take much more for ETH’s price to gain support. “They understood that the ETF flows were lackluster and it would take a lot more for ETH price to begin being supportive,” Ebtikar noted. Turning his attention to institutional capital, Ebtikar observed that when spot Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT, FBTC, ARKB, and BITW entered the market, they exceeded expectations. “These products broke any realistic target investors and experts could’ve fathomed with their success,” he stated. He emphasized that Bitcoin ETFs have become some of the most successful ETF products in history. “BTC went from being a dog in the average portfolio to now the only funnel for net new capital in crypto and at a record rate too,” he said. Despite Bitcoin’s surge, the rest of the market didn’t keep up. Ebtikar questioned why this was the case, pointing out that crypto-native investors, retail, and private capital had long since reduced their Bitcoin holdings. Instead, they were “stuck in altcoins and Ethereum as the core of their portfolio.” Consequently, when Bitcoin received its institutional bid, few in the crypto space benefited from the new wealth effect. “Few in crypto were beneficiaries of the newly made wealth effect,” he remarked. Investors began to reassess their portfolios, struggling to decide their next moves. Historically, crypto capital would cycle from index assets like Bitcoin to Ethereum and then down the risk curve to altcoins. However, traders speculated on potential flows into Ethereum and similar assets but were “broadly wrong.” The market started to diverge, and the dispersion between asset returns intensified. Professional crypto investors and traders moved aggressively down the risk curve, and funds followed suit to generate returns. Related Reading: Ethereum Faces ‘Sell-Off Risk’ If It Loses $2,300 Resistance – Analyst The asset they chose to reduce exposure to was Ethereum—the largest asset in their core portfolios. “Slowly but surely ETH started losing steam to SOL and similar, and a non-trivial percentage of this flow started really moving downstream to memecoins,” Ebtikar observed. “ETH lost its moat in crypto-savvy investors, the only group of investors who were historically interested in buying.” Even with the introduction of spot ETH ETFs, institutional capital paid little attention to Ethereum. Ebtikar described Ethereum’s predicament as suffering from “middle-child syndrome.” He elaborated, “The asset is not in vogue with institutional investors, the asset lost favor in crypto private capital circles, and retail is nowhere to be seen bidding anything at this size.” He emphasized that Ethereum is too large for native capital to support while other index assets like SOL and large caps like TIA, TAO, and SUI are capturing investor attention. According to Ebtikar, the only way forward is to expand the universe of potentially interested investors, which can only happen at the institutional level. “ETH’s best odds of making a material comeback (short of changes to the core protocol’s trajectory) is to have institutional investors pick up the asset in the coming months,” he suggested. He acknowledged that while Ethereum faces significant challenges, it is “the only other asset with an ETF and likely will be for some time.” This unique position offers a potential avenue for recovery. Ebtikar mentioned several factors that could influence Ethereum’s future trajectory. He cited the possibility of a Trump presidency, which could bring changes to regulatory frameworks affecting cryptocurrency. He also pointed to potential shifts in the Ethereum Foundation’s direction and core focus, suggesting that strategic changes could reinvigorate investor interest. Additionally, he highlighted the importance of marketing the ETH ETF by traditional asset managers to attract institutional capital. “Considering the possibility of a Trump Presidency, change at the Ethereum Foundation’s direction and core focus, and marketing of the ETH ETF by traditional asset managers, there are quite a few outs for the father of smart contracting platforms,” Ebtikar remarked. He expressed cautious optimism, stating that not all hope is lost for Ethereum. Looking ahead to 2025, Ebtikar believes it will be a critical year for cryptocurrency and especially for Ethereum. “2025 will very much be an interesting year for crypto and especially for Ethereum as so much of the damage from 2024 can be unwound or further deepened,” he concluded. “Time will tell.” At press time, ETH traded at $2,534.

After a brief pullback, buyers are stepping in, driving the asset higher and setting the stage for a potential breakout. A successful break could open the door to new gains, further reinforcing the positive sentiment in the market. As the price approaches this crucial level, the goal of this analysis is to determine whether WIF can sustain its upward strength and break through the $2.89 resistance. By evaluating key technical indicators, price trends, and market sentiment, this review will delve into the possible outcomes of this pivotal test, assessing the likelihood of either a continued rally or a possible pullback. Current Price Momentum: WIF Push Toward $2.89 WIF is exhibiting strong bullish momentum following a recovery from the $2.6 support level. By consistently trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), the cryptocurrency indicates that buyers are firmly in control, reflecting a strengthening trend. Maintaining this position could enhance optimistic sentiment and generate the push necessary to challenge higher resistance levels, particularly the $2.89 mark. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates a renewed upbeat potential, with the RSI climbing back to 62% after dipping to 50%. If the RSI continues to rise, it could point to further gains for WIF, as the asset regains strength and attracts more bullish traders aiming to push the price toward key resistance zones. Related Reading: WIF Bulls In Control As RSI Signals Strong Upside Potential Furthermore, the daily chart indicates that WIF is under significant upward pressure, marked by a bullish candlestick formation after rebounding from $2.6 and trading above the 100-day SMA. This suggests strong buyer activity, positioning the meme coin to challenge the critical resistance level of $2.89. Also, the RSI on the daily chart currently stands at 66%, comfortably above the 50% threshold, indicating a positive shift in momentum for WIF. A sustained position above 50% generally signifies that buyers are in control. If this pressure continues, it could lead to more price appreciation as traders remain optimistic about the asset’s potential to break through key resistance levels. Potential Outcomes: Rally Continuation Or Pullback? A continuation of the current rally could see WIF breaking above the $2.89 resistance, paving the way for further gains and possibly reaching new highs. This scenario is supported by the positive momentum indicated by the RSI and the price’s position above the 100-day Simple Moving Average. Related Reading: Is DogWifHat (WIF) The “Most Bearish” Of All Major Meme Coins? Should WIF fail to break through the $2.89 resistance, it could face a pullback toward the $2.2 support level. A drop below this support would raise doubts about the sustainability of the current upward movement, potentially triggering a more significant decline toward the $1.5 support level.
