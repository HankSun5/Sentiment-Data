Based on the examination of crypto expert Javon Marks, the token has recently emerged from a declining wedge formation, which may suggest that a substantial price increase is in the offing. Related Reading: Whales Hoard $90 Million In Bitcoin: A Sign Of What’s To Come? Marks estimates that SHIB might increase by 342% and reach $0.000081, a level not seen since the bull run of 2021. If current trends continue, the canine-inspired digital asset may see a significant price turnaround. Following that milestone break, the future of SHIB’s price looks promising. According to the estimations, if the token reaches $0.00001794 in mid-November 2024, there will be a 0.65% immediate price gain. The current position at a neutral 50 of the Fear & Greed Index reveals a balanced state of mind on the market and correlates well with cautious optimism regarding the change in SHIB price. Of late, in the last 30 days, SHIB has been green for half the days, 15, and that too supports further future development. $SHIB (Shiba Inu) – Are you prepared for $0.000081!? With SHIB broken out of a recent Falling Wedge pattern and a much larger (unpictured) resisting trend, an over 342% run from here to it could happen ASAP, and this falling wedge break may only help spark the process 🧨! https://t.co/wSz2eVepSp pic.twitter.com/eefYqFGg1N — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) October 11, 2024 The Power Of A Falling Wedge For the last five months, SHIB has been in a falling wedge pattern, which is a chart pattern in technical analysis that normally trends with a strong bullish reversal. As such, this particular pattern, where the lows are lower and the highs are lower, has proven to be a trigger for breakouts. In March 2024, the pattern was apparently clear, as SHIB declined from the yearly high at $0.000045. According to Marks, it may be the breakthrough that pushes the token all the way to $0.000081. Key Indicators Point To Strength Momentum may be emerging as SHIB trades around $0.00001785 with persistent higher lows. Additionally, the token’s 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) are lower than the current price, suggesting bullishness. The fact that SHIB is still trading above its 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) indicates that it is in an uptrend over the long term, despite the fact that it is trading below its 50-day SMA, which is often a bearish signal. The confluence of these indicators indicates that SHIB is stable, although it is possible for it to move farther in any direction.

Support And Resistance Levels Looking forward, Shiba Inu has important support around $0.000017; resistance at $0.000018 and $0.000019. Should the token be able to surpass these resistance thresholds, it may rapidly achieve the target anticipated at $0.000081. Meanwhile, there still is room for development, but traders and investors should continue to watch closely the activity of the price because the next steps for SHIB can validate the breakout or trigger even more consolidation. Yet considering past trends and technical hints that look hopeful, it might be just a matter of time before SHIB explodes into significant value soon.

BTC is now consolidating and might aim for more upsides above $63,000. Bitcoin is struggling to start a fresh increase above the $63,200 zone. The price is trading above $61,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a short-term declining channel forming with resistance at $63,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could regain traction if there is a close above the $63,200 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Holds Support Bitcoin price formed a base and started a fresh increase above the $61,200 resistance. BTC cleared the $62,000 resistance to move into a positive zone. The price even spiked above $63,000 before the bears appeared. A high was formed at $63,445 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the $63,000 level. There was a minor move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $58,888 swing low to the $63,445 high. Bitcoin price is now trading above $62,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $63,000 level. There is also a short-term declining channel forming with resistance at $63,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The first key resistance is near the $63,200 level. A clear move above the $63,200 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $63,500. A close above the $63,200 resistance might initiate more gains. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $64,500 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $65,000 resistance level. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $63,200 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $62,250 level. The first major support is near the $62,000 level. The next support is now near the $61,150 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $58,888 swing low to the $63,445 high. Any more losses might send the price toward the $60,000 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $62,000, followed by $61,150.

The price could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.5450 and $0.5500 resistance levels. XRP price is attempting a fresh increase above the $0.5320 support. The price is now trading above $0.5350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $0.5310 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.5450 and $0.5500 resistance levels. XRP Price Holds Key Support XRP price remained stable above the $0.5240 support. A base was formed and the price started a fresh increase above $0.5350 like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price climbed above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5430 swing high to the $0.5252 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $0.5310 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $0.5350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5390 level. It is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5430 swing high to the $0.5252 low. The first major resistance is near the $0.5400 level. The next key resistance could be $0.5450. A clear move above the $0.5450 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5500 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5680 resistance or even $0.5750 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $0.600, where the bears might emerge. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $0.540 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5340 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The next major support is near the $0.5280 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5280 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5250 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.5120 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.5340 and $0.5280.

In an analysis shared via X (formerly Twitter), Ebtikar writes, “Independent of the myriad of (probable) bad decisions that the ETH foundation & co have made there’s another structural reason why ETH has traded like a dog this cycle.” Why Is The Ethereum Price Lagging Behind? Ebtikar began by emphasizing the importance of understanding capital flows within the crypto market. He identified three primary sources of capital flow: retail investors who engage directly through platforms like Coinbase, Binance, and Bybit; private capital from liquid and venture funds; and institutional investors who invest directly through Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and futures. However, he noted that retail investors are “hardest to quantify” and are “not fully present in the market today,” thus excluding them from his analysis. Focusing on private capital, Ebtikar highlighted that in 2021, this segment was the largest capital base, driven by crypto euphoria that attracted more than $20 billion in net new inflows. “Fast forward to today, private capital is no longer the heavy hitter capital base as ETFs and other traditional vehicles have taken the role of the largest net new buyer of crypto,” he stated. He attributed this decline to a series of poor venture investments and overhang from prior cycles, which have “left a bad taste in the mouths of LPs.” These venture firms and liquid funds recognized that they couldn’t wait out another cycle and needed to be more proactive. They began taking more “shots on target” for liquid plays, often through private deals involving locked tokens such as Solana (SOL), Celestia (TIA), and Toncoin (TON). “These locked deals also represented something more interesting for a lot of firms—there’s a world outside of Ethereum-based investing that is actually growing and usable and has enough market cap growth relative to ETH that could justify the underwriting of the investment,” Ebtikar explained. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Score Signals Cooling Market Momentum – Time To Buy? He noted that investors were aware it would be increasingly difficult to raise funds for venture and liquid investments. Without the return of retail capital, institutional products became the only viable avenue for a bid for ETH. Mindshare began fragmenting as the three-year mark of the 2021 vintage approached, and products like BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) gained legitimacy as the de facto benchmark for crypto. Private capital had to make a choice: “Abandon their core portfolio hold in ETH and move down the risk curve or hold your breath for traditional players to start bailing you out.” This led to the formation of two camps. The first consisted of pre-ETF ETH sellers between January and May 2024, who opted out of ETH and swapped to assets like SOL. The second group, post-ETF ETH sellers from June to September 2024, realized that ETF flows into ETH were lackluster and that it would take much more for ETH’s price to gain support. “They understood that the ETF flows were lackluster and it would take a lot more for ETH price to begin being supportive,” Ebtikar noted. Turning his attention to institutional capital, Ebtikar observed that when spot Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT, FBTC, ARKB, and BITW entered the market, they exceeded expectations. “These products broke any realistic target investors and experts could’ve fathomed with their success,” he stated. He emphasized that Bitcoin ETFs have become some of the most successful ETF products in history. “BTC went from being a dog in the average portfolio to now the only funnel for net new capital in crypto and at a record rate too,” he said. Despite Bitcoin’s surge, the rest of the market didn’t keep up. Ebtikar questioned why this was the case, pointing out that crypto-native investors, retail, and private capital had long since reduced their Bitcoin holdings. Instead, they were “stuck in altcoins and Ethereum as the core of their portfolio.” Consequently, when Bitcoin received its institutional bid, few in the crypto space benefited from the new wealth effect. “Few in crypto were beneficiaries of the newly made wealth effect,” he remarked. Investors began to reassess their portfolios, struggling to decide their next moves. Historically, crypto capital would cycle from index assets like Bitcoin to Ethereum and then down the risk curve to altcoins. However, traders speculated on potential flows into Ethereum and similar assets but were “broadly wrong.” The market started to diverge, and the dispersion between asset returns intensified. Professional crypto investors and traders moved aggressively down the risk curve, and funds followed suit to generate returns. Related Reading: Ethereum Faces ‘Sell-Off Risk’ If It Loses $2,300 Resistance – Analyst The asset they chose to reduce exposure to was Ethereum—the largest asset in their core portfolios. “Slowly but surely ETH started losing steam to SOL and similar, and a non-trivial percentage of this flow started really moving downstream to memecoins,” Ebtikar observed. “ETH lost its moat in crypto-savvy investors, the only group of investors who were historically interested in buying.” Even with the introduction of spot ETH ETFs, institutional capital paid little attention to Ethereum. Ebtikar described Ethereum’s predicament as suffering from “middle-child syndrome.” He elaborated, “The asset is not in vogue with institutional investors, the asset lost favor in crypto private capital circles, and retail is nowhere to be seen bidding anything at this size.” He emphasized that Ethereum is too large for native capital to support while other index assets like SOL and large caps like TIA, TAO, and SUI are capturing investor attention. According to Ebtikar, the only way forward is to expand the universe of potentially interested investors, which can only happen at the institutional level. “ETH’s best odds of making a material comeback (short of changes to the core protocol’s trajectory) is to have institutional investors pick up the asset in the coming months,” he suggested. He acknowledged that while Ethereum faces significant challenges, it is “the only other asset with an ETF and likely will be for some time.” This unique position offers a potential avenue for recovery. Ebtikar mentioned several factors that could influence Ethereum’s future trajectory. He cited the possibility of a Trump presidency, which could bring changes to regulatory frameworks affecting cryptocurrency. He also pointed to potential shifts in the Ethereum Foundation’s direction and core focus, suggesting that strategic changes could reinvigorate investor interest. Additionally, he highlighted the importance of marketing the ETH ETF by traditional asset managers to attract institutional capital. “Considering the possibility of a Trump Presidency, change at the Ethereum Foundation’s direction and core focus, and marketing of the ETH ETF by traditional asset managers, there are quite a few outs for the father of smart contracting platforms,” Ebtikar remarked. He expressed cautious optimism, stating that not all hope is lost for Ethereum. Looking ahead to 2025, Ebtikar believes it will be a critical year for cryptocurrency and especially for Ethereum. “2025 will very much be an interesting year for crypto and especially for Ethereum as so much of the damage from 2024 can be unwound or further deepened,” he concluded. “Time will tell.” At press time, ETH traded at $2,534.

After a brief pullback, buyers are stepping in, driving the asset higher and setting the stage for a potential breakout. A successful break could open the door to new gains, further reinforcing the positive sentiment in the market. As the price approaches this crucial level, the goal of this analysis is to determine whether WIF can sustain its upward strength and break through the $2.89 resistance. By evaluating key technical indicators, price trends, and market sentiment, this review will delve into the possible outcomes of this pivotal test, assessing the likelihood of either a continued rally or a possible pullback. Current Price Momentum: WIF Push Toward $2.89 WIF is exhibiting strong bullish momentum following a recovery from the $2.6 support level. By consistently trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), the cryptocurrency indicates that buyers are firmly in control, reflecting a strengthening trend. Maintaining this position could enhance optimistic sentiment and generate the push necessary to challenge higher resistance levels, particularly the $2.89 mark. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates a renewed upbeat potential, with the RSI climbing back to 62% after dipping to 50%. If the RSI continues to rise, it could point to further gains for WIF, as the asset regains strength and attracts more bullish traders aiming to push the price toward key resistance zones. Related Reading: WIF Bulls In Control As RSI Signals Strong Upside Potential Furthermore, the daily chart indicates that WIF is under significant upward pressure, marked by a bullish candlestick formation after rebounding from $2.6 and trading above the 100-day SMA. This suggests strong buyer activity, positioning the meme coin to challenge the critical resistance level of $2.89. Also, the RSI on the daily chart currently stands at 66%, comfortably above the 50% threshold, indicating a positive shift in momentum for WIF. A sustained position above 50% generally signifies that buyers are in control. If this pressure continues, it could lead to more price appreciation as traders remain optimistic about the asset’s potential to break through key resistance levels. Potential Outcomes: Rally Continuation Or Pullback? A continuation of the current rally could see WIF breaking above the $2.89 resistance, paving the way for further gains and possibly reaching new highs. This scenario is supported by the positive momentum indicated by the RSI and the price’s position above the 100-day Simple Moving Average. Related Reading: Is DogWifHat (WIF) The “Most Bearish” Of All Major Meme Coins? Should WIF fail to break through the $2.89 resistance, it could face a pullback toward the $2.2 support level. A drop below this support would raise doubts about the sustainability of the current upward movement, potentially triggering a more significant decline toward the $1.5 support level.

This sudden price jump has sent shockwaves through the crypto market, with data from Coinglass revealing a significant wave of liquidations following the unexpected rally. Short sellers, who were anticipating a decline, found themselves in a tough spot as Bitcoin defied their expectations. Notably, liquidation data from Coinglass shows that over $182 million worth of positions have been liquidated across various exchanges in the past 24 hours, with a majority being short positions. Bitcoin Price Breaks Above $64,000 Again Bitcoin rose above $64,000 in the early hours of Monday, October 14, after breaking above a tight range over the weekend and gaining 2.53% in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin reached as high as $64,500 in the past few hours, which is its highest point so far in October. As such, the Bitcoin price has now crossed above its open for the month, with the October monthly return finally turning green for the first time.

According to the data shown in the picture below, the sudden rise has been costly for many traders holding short positions. Bears who bet on a continued decline were hit hard as Bitcoin’s continued rally triggered a wave of liquidations. Of the $182 million worth of liquidations recorded across various exchanges, a staggering $115.76 million came from short positions, while $66.28 million were from long positions. Binance has led the crypto exchange market in liquidations over the past 24 hours, accounting for 42.48% of the total liquidations. On Binance alone, approximately $77.33 million worth of positions were wiped out, with 54.23% being short positions. OKX follows closely, with $58.71 million in liquidations, where an even larger percentage of 62.84% were short positions. HTX, Bybit, and CoinEx also saw significant liquidations, though on a smaller scale. HTX recorded $27.35 million in liquidations, a staggering 87.81% of which were short positions. Bybit came next with $12.62 million in liquidations and a short rate of 65.92%, while CoinEx rounded out the list with $3.50 million liquidated, 81.34% of which was from shorts.

Bitcoin’s recent uptick brings back the possibility of a declining Uptober sentiment. This interesting rally could set the stage for a surge in the second half of October, similar to what was witnessed in September. If this rally were to continue for the rest of the month, we could see more short positions liquidated in the next few hours. Bears, who have been betting against Bitcoin’s rise, may rush to close their positions to minimize losses. The decrease in selling pressure from short sellers exiting the market could further fuel Bitcoin’s ascent.

Record-Low Reserves Could Hold The Key,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/whats-behind-bitcoin-and-ethereums-exchange-exodus-record-low-reserves-could-hold-the-key/,"Crypto investors are not keen on dealing with cryptocurrency trading platforms, which has resulted in the dwindling exchange reserves of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Centralized exchanges on Bitcoin and Ethereum hit a historic low after investors and crypto enthusiasts opted for self-custody solutions for their virtual assets. Related Reading: Uniswap: New Crypto Developments Lift UNI Price Up by 17% – Details Staying Away From Cryptocurrency Trading A recent trend showed that traders and other enthusiasts choose to hold on to their crypto assets rather than sell them on Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange platforms. They preferred direct ownership of their assets using self-custody wallets, which created an increasing demand for self-custody solutions. However, it led to a decline in the liquidity of BTC and ETH on centralized exchanges. Strengthening Bitcoin And Ethereum Values A positive consequence of traders’ preference for self-custody solutions is the increasing value of Bitcoin and Ethereum assets over time. Traders veering away from cryptocurrency trading platforms create a sense of scarcity, leading to the growth of its value. At the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin is pegged at $64,842. Since hitting a record-high of $73,000 in March this year, the price remains somewhere between $66,000 and $49,000. Meanwhile, according to Coinmarketcap, Ethereum is trading at $2,464. Bitcoin, Ethereum Reserves Drop Bitcoin and Ethereum on centralized reserves took a nosedive and hit a historic low early this month. As of October 13, CryptoQuant’s chart showed that centralized exchanges for BTC recorded an all-time low of 2,666,717 bitcoins. The highest amount of Bitcoin was pegged at 3,361,854, which was recorded on June 8, 2022. After that period, Bitcoin went on a sharp decline. It hit its lowest level early this month. In terms of volume, spot exchanges have 1.1 million Bitcoin in reserves, while derivative exchanges own 1.39 million reserves. By far, Binance owns 563,000 Bitcoin reserves, the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, followed by Kraken with 112,3000 reserves. On the other hand, Coinbase Advanced holds 830,530 Bitcoin reserves and Coinbase Prime has 3,000 reserves. Ethereum’s centralized exchanges also face a similar dilemma to Bitcoin wherein its reserves continue to plummet and hit a record low of 18.7 million. Related Reading: Tron Token Burn: 10 Million Gone—What Does It Mean For TRX Price? According to CryptoQuant, derivative exchanges hold a big portion of Ethereum with 10.3 million in reserves, while 8.4 million Ethereum reserves are being kept at spot exchanges. Historically, Ethereum’s all-time high in reserves was 2,310,823 recorded on 6 September 2022. Since that period, Ethereum reserves in central exchanges continue to plunge. In terms of reserves, Coinbase has a large reserve of 4.5 million Ethereum, followed by Binance with 3.6 million Ethereum. Kraken also holds a significant Ethereum reserve of 1.3 million.

Traders May Have Become Too Hyped Around Solana On Social Media Recently According to data from the analytics firm Santiment, the positive sentiment around SOL on social media has shot up to a nine-month high following the latest bullish momentum that the coin has seen. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Are Going Through A ‘Generational’ Shift, CryptoQuant CEO Reveals The indicator of relevance here is the “Positive Vs. Negative Sentiment,” which, as its name suggests, keeps track of the ratio between the amount of positive and negative comments related to Solana that are appearing on social media. This metric works by analyzing the posts/threads/messages on various social media platforms (X, Reddit, Telegram, 4Chan, and BitcoinTalk) and running them through a machine-learning model to determine which ones relate to positive sentiment and which ones relate to negative sentiment. When the indicator has a value greater than 1, it means the number of positive posts are outweighing the negative ones right now. On the other hand, it being under the mark implies the dominance of bearish comments. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Positive Vs. Negative Sentiment for Solana over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Solana Positive Vs. Negative Sentiment has registered a large spike as the latest recovery in the asset’s price has taken place. With this spike, the indicator has reached a value of more than 5.6, which means social media users are making over 5.6 times as many bullish posts as bearish ones. This is the highest that the metric has been in around nine months, so the traders are clearly quite optimistic about the current SOL rally. While some bullish moods can be conducive to rallies, an excess of them can actually prove to be an obstacle. Historically, cryptocurrencies like Solana have tended to show moves that are opposite to what the crowd is expecting. The probability of a contrary move rises the more sure the traders become of a direction, so a highly bullish market can lead to tops in the price. Related Reading: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Back To Positive Returns With $308 Million Inflows – Details This effect is also visible in the chart, as some past spikes in the Positive Vs. Negative Sentiment had occurred around local tops in Solana’s value. So far, SOL has only continued to rally further despite the investor FOMO, but considering the historical pattern, it’s possible a top may be hit before long, should hype on social media maintain at high levels. SOL Price Solana has continued its latest run with a 4% surge over the past day, which has taken its price above the $153 level.

The altcoin has surged 13% since last Thursday, showing signs of strength amid market volatility. Now, Solana is just 5% away from the $160 key resistance, a crucial level it hasn’t surpassed since early August. This resistance marks a pivotal point for SOL, as breaking above it could trigger a significant bullish move. Related Reading: Active Dogecoin Addresses Reach Highest Level In 8 Months – Is DOGE About To Rally? Top analyst and investor Carl Runefelt has shared a technical analysis suggesting that Solana is forming a bullish pattern. According to his analysis, if SOL breaks above this pattern, it could lead to a massive surge and potentially reach new all-time highs. As traders closely monitor this resistance level, the next few days will be crucial for determining Solana’s future price action. Investors are eager to see if SOL can break through and spark a broader rally or if it will face rejection and enter a consolidation phase. With momentum building, Solana’s price movements are at the center of attention in the crypto market. Solana Analyst Predicts New ATH Soon Solana is approaching the critical $160 resistance level after a 4% surge in the past few hours. Analysts and investors are paying close attention as the entire crypto market rebounds from local lows, and Solana is now poised to follow this trend. The cryptocurrency has gained 13% since last Thursday and is 5% away from breaking the key $160 resistance, a level it hasn’t surpassed since early August. The market’s growing optimism is reflected across social media platforms, where speculation about Solana’s future price action is mounting. Prominent crypto investor and analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared his technical analysis of Solana on X. In his analysis, Runefelt highlights that Solana is forming a bullish pattern, which could signal a massive breakout if the price breaks above the $160 resistance. According to Runefelt, Solana’s surge to new all-time highs would be substantial once it breaks the upper boundary of this bullish triangle pattern. The $160 zone has proven to be a key resistance level, pushing Solana’s price thrice since early August. As Solana moves closer to this critical level again, many investors are optimistic that the price will break through this time, leading to significant upside momentum.

The coming days will be crucial for Solana, as the market eagerly awaits confirmation of a breakout or further consolidation. If bulls break above the $160 resistance, it could pave the way for Solana to target new highs, driving renewed interest and momentum in the price of the altcoin. SOL Supply Zone About To Break Solana (SOL) is trading at $153 after a modest surge above the daily 200 moving average (MA) at $151. This upward movement marks a significant moment for SOL, as being above this crucial indicator is seen as a positive sign for potential future gains. If the price can maintain its position above the 1D 200 MA, it could pave the way for a direct push toward the key $160 resistance level. A successful close above $160 would open the door to a challenge of yearly highs around $210, enticing traders and investors looking for momentum in the altcoin. However, if Solana fails to maintain its position above the daily 200 MA, investors anticipate a retracement to lower demand levels around $140.

Investors are closely monitoring these levels, as they could signal either a continuation of the bullish momentum or a potential reversal, leading to increased volatility in the coming days.
