Leading the headlines is the Trump administration’s bold pivot into digital assets with the formation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This isn’t just a headline grabber—it’s a real-time policy move that throws institutional weight behind decentralized finance. Alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are being scooped into this national crypto vault, signaling a seismic shift in how the U.S. government views crypto utility and long-term viability. But not everything in the headlines comes without baggage. Critics are already pointing fingers at the Trump family’s financial connections to World Liberty Financial and its newly launched stablecoin, USD1. The lines between public governance and private ventures are blurring fast, and it’s raising eyebrows in legal and financial circles. Still, no matter which side of the fence you sit on, the outcome is clear: crypto’s now in the center of U.S. policy, and that changes the game. Amid this political and economic storm, a different breed of blockchain is rising to meet practical, future-proof demands. Qubetics ($TICS) is stepping in with solutions that most older chains never managed to scale or streamline. Its approach to cross-border transactions, real-world asset tokenization, and decentralized privacy tools places it in a unique category—accessible to businesses, usable by professionals, and flexible enough for the financial systems of tomorrow. While others are stuck patching legacy layers, Qubetics is building a whole new foundation. And community members are taking notice. Qubetics ($TICS): Cross-Border Transactions That Actually Make Sense One of the biggest headaches for global businesses? Payments across borders. High fees, lag times, and compliance chaos. Qubetics fixes that. Its blockchain infrastructure enables seamless, fast, and secure cross-border transactions for businesses, independent professionals, and everyday users. No middlemen. No red tape. Just direct, programmable value transfer. For folks dealing in international freelance work, supply chain contracts, or even remittances, this isn’t just convenient—it’s game-changing. Qubetics’ core technology stack isn’t built for hype—it’s built for utility. From legal-ready smart contract templates to low-latency transaction speeds, the system is designed to fit into real-world processes. The QubeQode IDE is another ace up its sleeve. Developers and non-devs alike can launch dApps or smart contracts with just a few clicks, skipping the dense code and saving both time and budget. It’s all about giving professionals tools that work—not just ideas that sound good in whitepapers. Presale Update and ROI Predictions And let’s talk about scale. The crypto presale is currently in its 31st stage, with each $TICS token priced at $0.1902. Over 509 million tokens have already been sold to 25,000+ holders, generating over $16.3 million in presale capital. Those who got in at stage 1 at $0.01? They’re sitting on a 1802% return right now. That’s not theory—that’s locked-in growth. Think it’s too late to join? Think again. With the current stage price still under 20 cents, the upside remains steep. If $TICS hits just $1, that’s a 425% ROI from here. At $5, you’re looking at 2527%. Should it climb to $6, returns spike to 3053%. And if it reaches $10, early backers would be staring down 5155%. The buzz? It’s coming from analysts eyeing even $15 after mainnet launch, a figure that translates to 7783% ROI from today’s price. Those numbers explain why Qubetics is headlining nearly every credible list of top coins to join today . Filecoin (FIL): AI + Storage Could Spark a Silent Revival Filecoin made waves during the 2020 DeFi boom, but now it’s staring down its toughest crowd: skeptics. Down nearly 99% from its all-time high of $237.73, FIL is trading around $2.11, hovering near historically low levels. But here’s where it gets interesting—this isn’t just a dying project. It’s repositioning for relevance in the age of AI + decentralized storage. At its core, Filecoin is still the go-to decentralized storage protocol for Web3 builders. It runs on the IPFS backbone and offers permissionless storage markets where users pay FIL to store and retrieve data. What keeps it technically credible is its dual-proof model—Proof-of-Replication (PoRep) and Proof-of-Spacetime (PoSt)—ensuring stored data is verifiable and tamper-proof. Here’s where the economics come in. Mining FIL is getting tougher. With operating costs estimated at $2.7 per token, many miners are either operating at breakeven or exiting altogether. That’s driving scarcity, and scarcity drives attention. Add to that its integration with AI-related storage demands and Web3 dApps, and the case for accumulation gets stronger. The key marker for community members is the $3 consensus zone. Historically, anytime FIL has dipped under that range, volume spikes and buy interest re-emerge. Now that the U.S. is shifting regulatory focus and crypto is being legitimized at the highest levels, FIL could find itself back in the spotlight—especially as decentralized data becomes mission-critical for AI infrastructure. It’s not just one of the top coins to join today for short-term plays—it’s a long-game utility bet. Avalanche (AVAX): Breakout Brewing on Bullish Charts Avalanche is cooking up something under the radar. As of April 2025, AVAX is displaying a classic double bottom pattern on the daily charts, suggesting a trend reversal could be just around the corner. After bouncing off $33 support and grinding toward the $38 neckline, it’s flirting with a technical breakout. Traders are watching closely. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is rebounding toward 50 after hanging in the 40s for a bit—bullish sentiment is creeping in. Volume is starting to pick up too, and not in a flash-in-the-pan way. It’s measured, steady, and quietly signaling confidence. The setup suggests Avalanche might be preparing for a larger move, and it’s catching attention for good reason. What makes Avalanche worthy of mention among the top coins to join today isn’t just the chart. It’s the speed and scalability under the hood. Subnet support, blazing-fast throughput, and an active DeFi ecosystem all point to a platform that’s far from done. With macro tailwinds coming in the form of U.S. government-led crypto acceptance, AVAX might just ride the technical momentum into a fundamental narrative shift. Final Thoughts Not all crypto assets are built equal. Some just trend. Others transform. The recent U.S. announcement to build a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve confirms what serious market watchers already suspected—digital assets are shifting from speculative toys to strategic infrastructure. And when governments get in the ring, early access to functional, utility-first tokens becomes priceless. Qubetics, with its plug-and-play developer suite, borderless transaction tech, and still-active presale, is clearly one of the top coins to join today. Filecoin’s narrative around decentralized AI storage is picking up steam, while Avalanche continues to flash bullish signals both on-chain and on charts. Those waiting for a “perfect” entry point? They’ll probably be watching the parade from the sidelines. For those willing to act while the market’s still quiet—this might just be the move that sets the tone for the next cycle.

43641792,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=151194,1745277609,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unveiling the Revolutionary INIT Tokenomics: A Deep Dive into Initia’s Layer-1 Blockchain,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/initia-tokenomics-layer1-blockchain-cosmos/,"The cryptocurrency world is constantly buzzing with anticipation for the next big thing, and the unveiling of tokenomics for a new project is always a moment of intense scrutiny and excitement. Recently, the Initia Foundation took center stage by revealing the tokenomics for INIT token , the lifeblood of their innovative layer-1 blockchain. This announcement, delivered via a concise update on X, has sparked considerable interest within the crypto community. Let’s delve into the details of this much-awaited tokenomics structure and understand what it means for the future of Initia and its ecosystem. Decoding the INIT Tokenomics: A Blueprint for Growth Initia, built upon the robust and versatile Cosmos SDK, is positioning itself as a significant player in the blockchain space. The foundation has laid out a clear and structured tokenomics model for INIT, with a total supply capped at 1 billion tokens. Understanding the distribution of these tokens is crucial for anyone looking to engage with the Initia ecosystem, whether as a developer, investor, or user. The token allocation is designed to foster a thriving and sustainable network. Let’s break down the key components: Enshrined Liquidity and Staking Rewards (25%): A quarter of the total INIT supply is dedicated to ensuring robust liquidity within the Initia network and incentivizing staking. This is a cornerstone for any successful blockchain, as it encourages token holders to actively participate in network security and stability by staking their tokens. In return, they are rewarded with more INIT tokens, fostering a long-term commitment to the ecosystem. Vested Interest Program (VIP) Rewards (25%): Matching the allocation for liquidity and staking, another 25% is earmarked for the Vested Interest Program (VIP). This suggests a strong emphasis on rewarding early supporters and key contributors to the Initia ecosystem. VIP rewards are often structured to incentivize long-term commitment and participation, further solidifying the foundation of the network. Protocol Sales (15.25%): A significant portion, 15.25%, is allocated to protocol sales. This is a common mechanism for projects to raise capital and ensure wider distribution of tokens. Protocol sales can take various forms, such as public sales or private placements, and are crucial for funding the ongoing development and expansion of the Initia ecosystem. Protocol Developers (15%): Recognizing the vital role of developers in any blockchain project, 15% of the INIT supply is allocated to protocol developers. This allocation serves to incentivize and reward the individuals and teams who are building and innovating on the Initia layer-1 blockchain . It ensures a continuous influx of talent and innovation, driving the technological advancement of the platform. Foundation (7.75%): The Initia Foundation itself receives 7.75% of the token supply. This allocation is essential for the foundation to operate, manage the ecosystem, and guide the long-term development and strategic direction of Initia. The foundation plays a crucial role in governance, partnerships, and overall ecosystem growth. Binance Launch Campaign (6%): A notable 6% is designated for the Binance launch campaign. This highlights the strategic importance of a Binance launch for Initia. Binance, being one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, provides significant visibility and liquidity. A dedicated allocation for a launch campaign on Binance suggests a proactive approach to market penetration and accessibility. Airdrops (5%): Airdrops are a popular method for distributing tokens and building community awareness. Initia has allocated 5% of the INIT supply for airdrops, indicating a commitment to community engagement and rewarding early adopters. Airdrops can be instrumental in fostering a vibrant and active user base. Echo.xyz Sales (1%): Finally, 1% is allocated to Echo.xyz sales. Echo.xyz is likely a partner platform or service within the Initia ecosystem. This allocation could be for strategic partnerships or integrations that enhance the overall value proposition of Initia. Allocation Category Percentage Enshrined Liquidity & Staking Rewards 25% Vested Interest Program (VIP) Rewards 25% Protocol Sales 15.25% Protocol Developers 15% Foundation 7.75% Binance Launch Campaign 6% Airdrops 5% Echo.xyz Sales 1% Total 100% Why is INIT Tokenomics Crucial for Initia’s Success? Tokenomics is the backbone of any cryptocurrency project. It dictates how the token functions within the ecosystem, how it is distributed, and how it incentivizes various stakeholders. Well-designed Initia tokenomics are essential for attracting users, developers, and investors, and for ensuring the long-term sustainability and growth of the network. In the case of INIT, the distribution appears to be carefully balanced to cater to different aspects of ecosystem development. The significant allocation towards enshrined liquidity and staking (25%) is a positive signal. It suggests a focus on building a robust and secure network right from the outset. Staking not only secures the blockchain but also provides passive income opportunities for token holders, encouraging participation and reducing circulating supply. This mechanism can contribute to price stability and long-term value appreciation of the INIT token. Similarly, the 25% allocated to the VIP program highlights the importance of early supporters and contributors. Rewarding these key stakeholders is crucial for fostering a loyal and dedicated community. These VIP rewards can take various forms, such as early access to features, exclusive NFTs, or increased staking rewards, further incentivizing engagement and advocacy for the Initia project. The Role of Cosmos SDK in Initia’s Foundation Initia being built on the Cosmos SDK is a significant factor contributing to its potential. The Cosmos SDK is renowned for its modularity, scalability, and interoperability. It allows developers to build custom blockchains tailored to specific needs, while also enabling seamless communication and asset transfer between different blockchains within the Cosmos ecosystem. By leveraging the Cosmos SDK, Initia benefits from a well-established framework, a vibrant developer community, and a proven track record of building successful blockchain projects. The choice of Cosmos SDK also implies that Initia is likely to be interoperable with other blockchains in the Cosmos network through the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. This interoperability can unlock a wide range of possibilities, allowing Initia to interact with various DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and other decentralized applications within the broader Cosmos ecosystem and beyond. Analyzing the Crypto Token Distribution Strategy The crypto token distribution strategy of INIT reveals a multi-faceted approach. Allocating a substantial portion to protocol sales (15.25%) is a standard practice for fundraising and ensuring broader token distribution. However, the relatively large allocation to protocol developers (15%) stands out, emphasizing Initia’s commitment to continuous innovation and technological advancement. This allocation is a strong indicator that Initia is prioritizing the long-term development and evolution of its platform. The 6% earmarked for the Binance launch campaign is also noteworthy. Securing a listing on a major exchange like Binance can significantly boost a project’s visibility, liquidity, and credibility. This allocation demonstrates a strategic focus on market access and adoption right from the launch phase. The airdrop allocation (5%) further reinforces the community-centric approach, aiming to distribute tokens to a wider audience and foster early adoption. Potential Benefits and Challenges of INIT Tokenomics Benefits: Strong Liquidity and Staking Incentives: The 25% allocation to enshrined liquidity and staking is a major positive, promoting network security and token holder participation. Developer Focus: The 15% allocation to protocol developers signals a commitment to ongoing innovation and platform improvement. Community Engagement: Airdrops and the VIP program demonstrate a focus on building a strong and engaged community. Strategic Exchange Launch: The Binance launch campaign allocation highlights a proactive approach to market access and liquidity. Challenges: Execution Risk: The success of any tokenomics model depends on effective execution. Initia Foundation will need to deliver on its promises and manage the token distribution effectively. Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile. External market conditions could impact the success of the INIT token, regardless of the tokenomics structure. Competition: The layer-1 blockchain space is highly competitive. Initia will need to differentiate itself and demonstrate clear advantages over existing platforms. Actionable Insights and Future Outlook for INIT For those interested in the Initia ecosystem, understanding the INIT tokenomics is the first step. The detailed distribution provides valuable insights into the project’s priorities and long-term vision. The strong emphasis on staking, developer incentives, and community engagement suggests a well-thought-out strategy for building a sustainable and thriving blockchain platform. Keep an eye on the Binance launch and airdrop campaigns for potential opportunities to get involved early. As with any new cryptocurrency project, thorough research and due diligence are essential. While the INIT tokenomics structure appears promising, the ultimate success will depend on the team’s ability to execute its roadmap, build a vibrant ecosystem, and navigate the challenges of the competitive blockchain landscape. Conclusion: A Promising Foundation for Initia’s Journey The unveiling of the revolutionary INIT tokenomics by the Initia Foundation marks a significant milestone in their journey to build a leading layer-1 blockchain . The carefully structured distribution, with a focus on liquidity, staking, developer incentives, and community engagement, lays a strong foundation for future growth and adoption. Built on the robust Cosmos SDK, Initia is poised to make a meaningful impact in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency space. As the project progresses, it will be crucial to monitor its execution and the development of its ecosystem. However, the initial signs, as reflected in the INIT tokenomics, are undoubtedly encouraging and signal a promising future for Initia.

DOGE price has potentially bottomed, but a retest could happen again before market reversal. Dogecoin (DOGE), the largest memecoin by market capitalization, remains highly synchronized with Bitcoin’s (BTC) price action. Most importantly, the large-cap memecoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $23.5 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $1 billion, has been recording a similar fractal pattern to the 2021 and 2017 bull cycles. As a result, the odds of a major parabolic rally before the end of 2025 remain palpable, especially catalyzed by the notable rally of Gold price. Delayed Altseason Threatens Short-term Dogecoin Price Outlook The involvement of the government in the crypto market through complex global regulations has significantly impacted the four-year crypto cycle. During the 2021 crypto cycle, most of the altcoins were in price discovery during the second quarter, with large-cap altcoins having reached respective peaks. I think that #ALT / #BTC pairs will continue to bleed here, just like they did last year when the Fed announced they would slow Quantitative Tightening (QT). #BTC dominance to 66% pic.twitter.com/HGBh6Ob7Gl — Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) April 21, 2025 According to crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen, the altcoin market will continue to bleed to Bitcoin in the near term. The crypto analyst expects Bitcoin dominance to reach 66 percent in the coming weeks, thus causing altcoins to drop another 10-20 percent. In the daily timeframe, the DOGE price has been retesting a crucial logarithmic support level established since 2023. Although DOGE price has signaled a breakout from a YTD falling logarithmic trend, the MACD and Relative Strength Index (RSI) have not yet signaled the onset of bullish sentiment. As a result, DOGE’s price is well positioned to drop towards 14 cents again before rebounding towards price discovery soon. DOGE’s Bigger Picture Backed by a robust online community of more than 6 million on-chain holders, Dogecoin has grown to be a major crypto asset. Most importantly, the unwavering support from tech billionaire Elon Musk and his family of unicorns has helped attract more institutional support. Already, several fund managers have filed with the U.S. SEC to offer spot DOGE ETFs. Meanwhile, Dogecoin’s core developers are seeking to expand the network to cover the DeFi ecosystem. Furthermore, the DeFi ecosystem has helped top-tier layer one chains, such as Solana (SOL), remain competitive in the past two years.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-21 23:26:50

This, the media outlet noted, is the largest monthly total since the BOK began publishing crypto-related data. The historical headquarters of the Bank of Korea in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: Mostly1) Experts appear to agree that the election of Donald Trump to the White House in November 2024 sparked a flurry of crypto purchases in South Korea. The December figure increased by 987 million compared to November. At the end of October last year, weeks before the US presidential election, South Koreans HODLed “only 58 trillion won ($41 billion).” The x2.2 rise in the two months from October to December 2024 was due largely to President Trump’s “crypto-related manifesto promises,” the outlet added. Transaction volumes also spiked after the elections, the BOK noted. The average daily transaction volume hit the 17.2 trillion won ($12.1 billion) mark in the last days of 2024. This marked a five-fold rise on October’s volume figures. Trading volumes on the South Korean market-leading crypto exchange Upbit over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Trump Not the Only Factor Spurring Growth, BOK Says However, the bank suggested that domestic conditions also proved conducive to crypto market growth at the end of 2024. The BOK’s report noted that the Virtual Asset User Protection Act, a law that includes several clauses pertaining to crypto user protection and unfair trading, came into force in July. Lawmakers were due to begin work on “second-stage” discussions to improve the act in November the same year. Ultimately, this process was largely derailed by the political chaos that ensued after President Yoon Suk-yeol’s attempt to impose martial law on December 3 . However, regulators and lawmakers alike have vowed to return to the matter of crypto sector reform after June’s presidential elections. And the BOK suggested that it also expects progress in this area before the year is out. Many industry insiders have expressed dismay at the fact that South Korean companies are still unable to launch cryptoassets or stablecoins on the domestic market. Firms are also still blocked from using their balance sheets to buy Bitcoin (BTC) and other tokens. However, regulators have indicated that this is likely to change before the year is out. Critics claim that the delay has allowed the US and Japanese crypto sectors to grow while South Korea’s blockchain industry stagnates.

The bank wrote that a stablecoin regulatory “system” was likely on its way. But the BOK expressed concerns about the rise of stablecoins, writing: “Unlike conventional virtual assets, stablecoins have the inherent characteristics of a means of payment. If they are widely issued and circulated and used as a means of payment to replace legal tender, they may have negative effects on the implementation of central bank policies. Monetary policy, financial stability, payments, and settlements could all be affected. A separate regulatory ecosystem is needed.” South Korea's acting president says tariff talks with US may not be easy https://t.co/syhwlfQdpi pic.twitter.com/scAWNlH5Pv — Reuters (@Reuters) April 21, 2025 The bank promised to “actively participate in future discussions on stablecoin legislation.” It said it intended to liaise with the Virtual Asset Committee, a regulatory advisory body designed to form South Korean crypto policy. The BOK said it would provide the committee with “opinions on the direction of stablecoin regulation from a central bank’s perspective.” The post Koreans HODLing Hit a Record $73.4B After Trump’s Crypto Push appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Central Bank|South Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-04-21 23:30:00
43642121,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=151197,1745278201,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unwavering Bullish Bitcoin Stance: Bitfinex Traders Hold Strong Amidst Volatility,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitfinex-margin-longs-bullish-btc/,"Are you wondering what the smart money is doing amidst the rollercoaster ride of the crypto market? Look no further than Bitfinex, where a powerful signal is flashing: Bitfinex margin longs are holding strong, suggesting that seasoned traders are maintaining a decidedly bullish Bitcoin stance . Despite recent dips and surges in BTC price volatility , these market participants are showing unwavering confidence in Bitcoin’s future. Decoding the Bitfinex Signal: Why Margin Longs Matter? Bitfinex is not just any crypto exchange; it’s a platform often frequented by seasoned traders, including crypto whales and large arbitrage desks. Their trading activity can offer valuable insights into market sentiment. When we talk about margin longs, we’re referring to leveraged positions that traders take out, betting on the price of Bitcoin to rise. A ‘long’ position is essentially a bet that the asset’s price will go up. Here’s what the recent data reveals: Consistent Bullish Positions: Between April 10th and 17th, Bitfinex traders held steady at approximately 80,400 BTC in margin longs. This level is inching closer to a seven-month high, indicating a strong and persistent bullish outlook. Slight Reduction, Still Bullish: Even when Bitcoin bounced back and reclaimed the $83,000 mark, these traders only trimmed their leveraged bullish positions slightly, by about 1,250 BTC (roughly $106 million). This isn’t a sign of panic selling, but rather a minor adjustment within a larger bullish strategy. Dominance of Longs Over Shorts: Currently, the total margin longs stand at a substantial 79,136 BTC, valued at around $6.86 billion. In stark contrast, margin shorts (bets that the price will fall) are a mere 326 BTC. This massive disparity underscores the overwhelming bullish sentiment among Bitfinex’s margin traders. Navigating BTC Price Volatility: Confidence Amidst the Storm? Bitcoin, as we know, is no stranger to price swings. The cryptocurrency market is renowned for its volatility, and recent weeks have been no exception. Despite these fluctuations, the steadfast margin longs on Bitfinex suggest that these experienced traders are looking beyond short-term turbulence. They seem to be playing a longer game, confident in Bitcoin’s potential to appreciate in value over time. But why aren’t they spooked by the volatility? Long-Term Vision: Whales and institutional traders often have a longer investment horizon. They might view short-term dips as buying opportunities rather than reasons to panic. Market Experience: These traders are typically seasoned professionals who have weathered numerous market cycles. They are less likely to be swayed by short-term FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt). Fundamental Belief: The consistent bullish positions could reflect a strong underlying belief in Bitcoin’s fundamentals, such as its scarcity, decentralization, and increasing adoption. Margin Trading: A Double-Edged Sword? Margin trading amplifies both potential profits and potential losses. It involves borrowing funds to trade, allowing traders to control larger positions than their capital would otherwise permit. While it can magnify gains when the market moves in your favor, it can also lead to significant losses if the market moves against you. The fact that Bitfinex traders are maintaining such high margin longs indicates a high degree of confidence, but it also comes with inherent risks. Key aspects of margin trading to understand: Aspect Description Leverage Using borrowed capital to increase trading positions. Higher leverage magnifies both gains and losses. Margin Requirements The initial capital required to open a margin position. Exchanges set margin requirements to manage risk. Liquidation Risk If the market moves against a margin position and the trader’s equity falls below the maintenance margin, the position can be automatically closed (liquidated) to cover losses. Funding Rates Traders borrowing funds for margin trading may need to pay funding rates, which can vary depending on market conditions. Crypto Whales: Market Movers and Shakers The actions of crypto whales , particularly on platforms like Bitfinex, can have a noticeable impact on the market. Their large trades can create ripples, influencing price movements and overall market sentiment. When whales take a strong bullish stance, as evidenced by the persistent margin longs, it can act as a signal to other market participants. However, it’s crucial to remember: Not Always Predictive: While whale activity can be informative, it’s not a foolproof predictor of future price movements. Markets are complex and influenced by numerous factors. Potential for Manipulation: In less regulated markets like crypto, there’s always a potential, albeit often debated, for large players to manipulate prices to some extent. Independent Analysis is Key: Relying solely on whale activity for trading decisions is risky. Always conduct your own research and consider a range of indicators and analysis. Actionable Insights: What Can Traders Learn? So, what can the average crypto trader glean from this data on Bitfinex margin longs ? Sentiment Check: The strong bullish positions suggest that at least a significant segment of experienced traders remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s prospects, even amidst volatility. Confirmation (Not Blind Faith): This data can serve as a confirmation signal, aligning with other bullish indicators you might be observing. However, it shouldn’t be the sole basis for your trading decisions. Risk Management Remains Paramount: Even if whales are bullish, the risks of margin trading are real. Always practice sound risk management, understand leverage, and never trade with more than you can afford to lose. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on whale activity, but also consider broader market trends, fundamental analysis, and news events to form a well-rounded view. Conclusion: A Bullish Undercurrent in the Bitcoin Sea? The unwavering bullish Bitcoin stance of Bitfinex margin traders offers a compelling glimpse into the sentiment of seasoned market participants. Despite BTC price volatility and market uncertainties, these crypto whales are holding firm to their long positions, suggesting a deep-seated confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. While margin trading involves risks and no single indicator is definitive, the Bitfinex data points to a potentially significant bullish undercurrent in the Bitcoin market. As always, traders should use this information as one piece of the puzzle, combined with their own research and risk management strategies.

The newly launched ZORA token is facing a wave of criticism even before it finds its footing. Leading the charge is none other than blockchain sleuth ZachXBT, whose sharp words on X (formerly Twitter) have ignited a serious debate about the token’s actual purpose. Is the ZORA token just hype, or is there something more beneath the surface? Let’s dive into the unfolding drama and see what’s causing the crypto community to raise eyebrows. ZachXBT’s Scathing Criticism of ZORA Token Utility ZachXBT, a respected figure in the crypto space known for his on-chain investigations and uncovering scams, didn’t mince words when it came to the ZORA token. He took to X to express his skepticism, labeling the ZORA token as “vapor.” This harsh criticism stems from the perceived lack of tangible utility associated with the token, especially when juxtaposed with Zora’s significant funding and valuation. Here’s a breakdown of ZachXBT’s core arguments: “Vaporware” Allegations: ZachXBT directly called the ZORA token “vapor,” implying it’s insubstantial and lacks real-world application. This is a strong indictment, suggesting the token is more hype than substance. Questioning Utility: His tweet directly questions the crypto utility of the ZORA token. In the crowded crypto market, tokens need to offer clear benefits to holders, whether it’s governance, access to services, or staking rewards. ZachXBT seems to believe ZORA is falling short in this crucial aspect. Context of Funding and Valuation: ZachXBT highlighted the contrast between the token’s perceived lack of utility and Zora’s impressive financial backing. With $60 million in funding and a $600 million valuation, expectations are naturally high. The criticism implies that a project with such resources should deliver more than a token deemed “for fun only.” Decoding ZORA Tokenomics: “For Fun Only” and No Governance Adding fuel to the fire is Zora’s own tokenomics announcement. It explicitly states that the ZORA token is intended “for fun only” and explicitly offers no governance rights or equity stakes. This unusual approach has baffled many in the crypto community. Let’s examine the key points of Zora’s tokenomics: “For Fun Only”: This phrase is highly unusual for a cryptocurrency project. Most tokens aim to build ecosystems, empower users, or decentralize control. Describing a token as “for fun only” downplays its potential and raises questions about its long-term viability. No Governance Rights: Many crypto tokens grant holders governance rights, allowing them to participate in decision-making processes for the project. The absence of governance rights for ZORA token holders means they have no say in the future direction of the Zora network. No Equity: Unlike some tokens that represent a share in a project’s profits or ownership, the ZORA token explicitly offers no equity. This further limits its potential value proposition beyond mere speculation. This unconventional tokenomics model has led many to question the genuine purpose behind the ZORA token. If it’s not for governance, utility, or equity, what exactly is it for? The Debate Rages On: Community Reactions and Perspectives ZachXBT’s criticism has resonated with a significant portion of the crypto community, sparking a lively debate about the merits and demerits of the ZORA token. Social media platforms are awash with discussions, with opinions ranging from staunch agreement with ZachXBT to defenses of Zora’s approach. Arguments Supporting ZachXBT’s Criticism: Lack of Clear Use Case: Many agree that the “for fun only” designation and absence of governance or equity make the crypto utility of the ZORA token unclear. They argue that tokens need to offer tangible benefits to justify their existence and value. Valuation Disconnect: Critics point to the $600 million Zora valuation as being incongruous with a token that seemingly has no practical purpose. They argue that such a valuation should be supported by a more robust token model. Potential for Speculation and Hype: Some worry that a token marketed as “for fun only” could easily become a target for speculation and hype, potentially leading to unsustainable price bubbles and eventual crashes. Arguments Defending ZORA Token: Community and Engagement: Supporters argue that the ZORA token might be designed to foster community engagement and reward participation within the Zora ecosystem, even if it lacks traditional utility. “Fun” could be interpreted as gamification or social interaction. Experimentation and Innovation: Some believe Zora is experimenting with a new token model, pushing the boundaries of what tokens can represent. They argue that not every token needs to be tied to governance or equity and that “fun” can be a valid form of utility in the crypto space. Long-Term Vision: Defenders suggest that Zora might have a long-term vision for the token that is not immediately apparent. The current tokenomics could be a starting point, with utility potentially being introduced in the future. The Broader Context: Crypto Utility and Token Value The ZORA token criticism highlights a fundamental question in the cryptocurrency world: what truly constitutes crypto utility and drives token value? The debate around ZORA touches upon several key aspects of tokenomics and project sustainability. Aspect Traditional Utility Tokens “Fun” Tokens (e.g., ZORA) Primary Purpose Enable access to services, governance, staking, etc. Community engagement, social interaction, experimentation Value Proposition Tangible benefits, functional use cases Intangible benefits, speculative value, community sentiment Long-Term Sustainability Relies on ecosystem growth and adoption of utility Potentially relies on community enthusiasm and evolving use cases Investor Expectations Return on investment through utility and growth Potentially more speculative, higher risk As the crypto space matures, the definition of utility is also evolving. While traditional utility tokens focus on functional applications, projects like Zora are exploring alternative models centered around community, culture, and even “fun.” Whether this approach proves sustainable remains to be seen. Actionable Insights: Navigating the ZORA Token Debate For crypto enthusiasts and potential investors, the ZORA token situation offers valuable lessons: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Thoroughly investigate any crypto project before investing. Understand the tokenomics , team, roadmap, and community sentiment. Evaluate Utility Critically: Assess the genuine crypto utility of a token. Does it offer tangible benefits or is it primarily driven by hype? Question unconventional token models like “for fun only.” Consider Valuation in Context: Analyze the project’s valuation in relation to its utility, funding, and market position. A high Zora valuation , as highlighted by ZachXBT, warrants careful scrutiny. Engage in Community Discussions: Follow discussions on social media and forums to understand diverse perspectives and gauge community sentiment around a project. Manage Risk: Be aware of the risks associated with speculative tokens, especially those with unclear utility. Invest responsibly and only what you can afford to lose. Conclusion: The ZORA Token Controversy – A Wake-Up Call? The ZachXBT criticism of the ZORA token has ignited a crucial conversation about crypto utility , tokenomics , and the very definition of value in the decentralized world. While Zora’s unconventional approach might be seen as innovative by some, the skepticism from respected voices like ZachXBT serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of substance over hype. The future of the ZORA token, and its ability to prove its worth beyond “fun,” will be closely watched by the crypto community. This situation underscores the need for critical thinking and due diligence in the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies.

That agency is now seeking public comments on whether it should open the wider world of derivatives to around-the-clock trading, as already executed for bitcoin and other digital assets. Though the CFTC is expected to be established as a crypto market regulator in Congress' ongoing effort to establish industry rules, the agency's invitation for comments issued on Monday doesn't explicitly discuss digital assets oversight. The request notes that ""technological advancements and market demand"" are pushing CFTC-regulated firms toward being able to handle transactions at all times. “As I have long said, the CFTC must take a forward-looking approach to shifts in market structure to ensure our markets remain vibrant and resilient while protecting all participants,” said Acting Chairman Caroline Pham, in a statement. She was tapped by President Donald Trump to run the agency while it awaits the Senate confirmation of its chairman nominee, Brian Quintenz . Trading without downtime presents a host of challenges for U.S. markets unaccustomed to it, according to the request, including ""what governance frameworks, exchange staffing models and technologies would be necessary to ensure market integrity and operational resilience, as well as compliance with all core principles, under a continuous trading model."" Such an expansion would require firms to handle live maintenance and technology patches and human monitoring of the systems and markets during the extended hours, which are issues already long wrestled with by digital assets operations. The CFTC would still need a change in law before it could have direct authority over actual spot-market trading of bitcoin and other tokens that aren't eventually categorized as securities, which would get Securities and Exchange Commission oversight. If the agency is ultimately a major regulator of trading and of the platforms and firms that handle customers' transactions, that's a space in which 24-hour, seven-days-a-week activity is already the model.",Policy|Caroline D.

They are pouring cash into gold, ultra-short Treasury ETFs, and low-volatility stocks at the fastest pace since March 2023. They are acting amid growing concern that a global trade war represents a lasting threat to economic and earnings growth. Data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show these three groups saw about $18 billion in total inflows so far in April, with roughly two‑thirds flowing into cash‑like funds. The SPDR Bloomberg 1‑3 Month T‑Bill ETF (BIL) attracted $8 billion this month, followed by the iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF (SHV) with $3 billion and the iShares 1‑3 Year Treasury Bond ETF (SHY) with $1 billion. Funds linked to gold have seen three straight months of gains, while low‑volatility equity ETFs have rebounded after nearly two years of outflows. Investors poured $18 billion into safe funds in April. Source: Bloomberg Risk‑off sentiment intensified on Monday when concerns over the Federal Reserve’s independence triggered a selloff in U.S. stocks, the dollar, and long‑dated Treasury bonds. The S&P 500 Index dropped 3% that day. Trump’s warning to the Fed caused investors to rush into safe funds President Donald Trump added to the mood, warning that the U.S. economy could slow if the Fed does not immediately cut interest rates. As a result, safe havens like the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen surged. “The market is searching for policy clarity out of Washington, and it remains elusive,” said Ryan Grabinski, senior investment strategist at Strategas Securities. “Consumers, businesses, and even the Fed are hesitant to make major decisions because so much is unknown.” Despite the risk‑off tilt, broad‑based index funds have continued to attract above‑average inflows. Leading the group is the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), which pulled in $35 billion over the past month. “We continue to see signs of caution but not panic,” said Cayla Seder, a macro multi‑asset strategist at State Street Global Markets. “At a high level, this looks like less flows going into equities and more demand for both fixed income and cash. All things considered, if hard data start to weaken, there’s more room to seek shelter.” Elsewhere, investors are still chasing high risk, with shares outstanding among the top 50 leveraged ETFs by assets rising 20% since Trump’s so‑called ‘Liberation Day’ on April 2. “The buy‑the‑dip mentality of investors remains,” said Mark Hackett, chief market strategist at Nationwide. “Despite near record levels of pessimism, retail investors continue to buy.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

43642862,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=151205,1745279455,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Exclusive: Binance Wallet Announces Hyperlane (HYPER) Token Generation Event – A Golden Opportunity?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/binance-wallet-hyperlane-token-event/,"Get ready crypto enthusiasts! Binance Wallet has just dropped some exciting news that’s sending ripples through the crypto community. They’ve announced that they will be the platform hosting the highly anticipated Hyperlane (HYPER) Token Generation Event (TGE) . If you’ve been keeping a close eye on the crypto sphere, you know that a TGE is a pivotal moment for any new token, and this one is generating significant buzz. Let’s dive into what this means for you and how you can potentially get involved. What’s the Buzz About the Hyperlane (HYPER) Token Generation Event on Binance Wallet? So, what exactly is this Token Generation Event all about? In simple terms, a TGE is like the grand debut of a cryptocurrency token. It’s the moment when a new token is officially launched and becomes available to the public. For Hyperlane (HYPER), this is a major milestone, marking its entry into the competitive world of cryptocurrencies. Binance Wallet, a leading name in the crypto wallet space, is providing the stage for this launch, adding credibility and visibility to the HYPER token right from the get-go. According to Binance Wallet’s announcement on X (formerly Twitter), the Hyperlane TGE is scheduled to kick off for a two-hour window starting at 9 a.m. (UTC) on April 22. Mark your calendars, folks! This isn’t just any token launch; it’s an event with a limited timeframe, adding an element of exclusivity and urgency. Who Gets to Participate in this Exclusive HYPER Token Event? Now, for the crucial question: Is this party open to everyone? Well, not exactly. Binance Wallet has specified that participation in this Hyperlane TGE is exclusive to those who purchased alpha tokens through either a Binance Wallet or a Binance Exchange account between March 23 and April 20. This means if you were proactive and got in on the alpha token sale during this period, you’re in luck! You’re on the VIP list for the HYPER token launch. This exclusivity is a strategic move. By rewarding early supporters who invested in alpha tokens, Binance and Hyperlane are fostering a sense of community and loyalty right from the start. It’s a way of saying ‘thank you’ to the early believers and ensuring that the initial distribution of HYPER tokens is in the hands of those who are already invested in the project’s vision. Why is Binance Wallet the Chosen Platform for Hyperlane TGE? Why did Hyperlane choose Binance Wallet to host their TGE? It’s a valid question. Binance is a giant in the crypto world, and its wallet service is widely trusted and used by millions globally. Here’s why this partnership makes perfect sense: Credibility and Trust: Binance’s reputation adds instant credibility to the Hyperlane project. Launching on Binance Wallet signals a level of vetting and trust that many other platforms simply can’t offer. Massive User Base: Binance Wallet boasts a massive user base. This provides Hyperlane with immediate access to a large pool of potential token holders and users, boosting visibility and adoption from day one. Seamless Experience: Binance Wallet offers a user-friendly and secure environment for participating in token events. For users already familiar with the Binance ecosystem, participating in the HYPER TGE will be a smooth and intuitive process. Security and Reliability: Security is paramount in crypto, and Binance is known for its robust security measures. Hosting the TGE on Binance Wallet minimizes risks associated with less secure or unknown platforms. In essence, choosing Binance Wallet is a strategic move by Hyperlane to ensure a successful and secure launch, leveraging Binance’s infrastructure and reputation to maximize the impact of their HYPER token entering the market. What is Hyperlane and Why Should You Care About HYPER Token? Now, let’s zoom out a bit and talk about Hyperlane itself. What is it, and why is its token launch such a big deal? Hyperlane is a project focused on interchain operability – essentially, making different blockchains talk to each other seamlessly. In a world where blockchain ecosystems are often siloed, projects like Hyperlane are crucial for the future of a connected and interoperable crypto space. Here’s a breakdown of why Hyperlane is gaining attention: Interoperability Solution: Hyperlane aims to solve the fragmentation issue in the blockchain world.

Scalability and Efficiency: By enabling cross-chain communication, Hyperlane can contribute to more scalable and efficient blockchain solutions. It allows developers to build dApps that can leverage the strengths of multiple blockchains. Growing Need for Interoperability: As the crypto space matures and more blockchains emerge, the need for interoperability solutions like Hyperlane becomes increasingly critical. It’s a foundational technology for the next phase of blockchain evolution. HYPER Token Utility: The HYPER token will likely play a key role in the Hyperlane ecosystem. While specific details about its utility will be unveiled, it’s expected to be used for governance, network security, and incentivizing participation in the Hyperlane network. Actionable Insights: Are You Eligible and What’s Next? If you’re reading this and wondering, “Am I eligible for the Hyperlane TGE on Binance Wallet?” here’s what you need to do: Check Your Purchase History: Review your Binance Wallet or Binance Exchange account history. Did you purchase alpha tokens between March 23 and April 20? Prepare Your Binance Wallet: Ensure your Binance Wallet is set up and ready for participation. Familiarize yourself with the wallet interface if you’re not already a regular user. Stay Tuned for Official Announcements: Keep a close watch on Binance Wallet’s official channels and Hyperlane’s announcements for detailed instructions on how to participate in the TGE on April 22. Understand the Timeline: Remember, the TGE is only for two hours, starting at 9 a.m. (UTC) on April 22. Be ready to act promptly during this window. DYOR (Do Your Own Research): While this is an exciting opportunity, always do your own research on Hyperlane and the HYPER token. Understand the project’s goals, technology, and potential risks before participating. Challenges and Considerations for Hyperlane TGE Participants While the Hyperlane TGE on Binance Wallet presents a promising opportunity, it’s also important to be aware of potential challenges and considerations: Limited Timeframe: The two-hour window for the TGE means you need to be prepared and act quickly. Technical issues or delays could impact your ability to participate. Token Volatility: Like any new cryptocurrency, the HYPER token is likely to experience volatility, especially in its early days. Be prepared for potential price fluctuations after the TGE. Network Congestion: High demand during the TGE could lead to network congestion on Binance Wallet. Ensure you have a stable internet connection and are ready to act swiftly. Security Awareness: Always be vigilant about security. Only follow official instructions from Binance Wallet and Hyperlane, and be wary of phishing attempts or scams related to the TGE. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Hyperlane and Binance Wallet The Binance Wallet hosting the Hyperlane TGE is more than just a token launch; it’s a significant event in the crypto calendar. It highlights the growing importance of interoperability in the blockchain space and showcases Binance Wallet’s role as a key platform for launching promising new projects. For those who are eligible, this TGE represents a unique opportunity to be early participants in the Hyperlane ecosystem.

Paul Atkins has officially been sworn in as the 34th chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The April 21 announcement comes nearly two weeks after Atkins’ position was confirmed by the US Senate in a 52-44 vote on April 9. “I am honored by the trust and confidence President Trump and the Senate have placed in me to lead the SEC,” said Atkins, who served as an SEC commissioner between 2002 and 2008. “As I return to the SEC, I am pleased to join with my fellow Commissioners and the agency’s dedicated professionals to advance its mission to facilitate capital formation; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and protect investors.” ”Together we will work to ensure that the U.S. is the best and most secure place in the world to invest and do business.” Atkins is widely expected to lead a more crypto-friendly SEC than former chair Gary Gensler under the Biden administration. Source: Cointelegraph His confirmation was reportedly delayed due to several financial disclosures that he needed to file as a result of marrying into a billionaire family. Some of those financial disclosures reportedly included up to $6 million worth of crypto-related investments, including crypto custody platform Anchorage Digital and blockchain tokenization platform Securitize. Atkins has taken over from acting chair Mark Uyeda, who helped the SEC establish a Crypto Task Force in January, aimed at strengthening rapport between the commission and industry players. The SEC has also dismissed several crypto probes and enforcement actions undertaken by the Gensler-led SEC in recent months, including cases involving Coinbase , Consensys, Gemini and Uniswap. Related: Crypto industry is not experiencing regulatory capture — Attorney The Atkins-led SEC currently has over 70 crypto-related exchange-traded fund applications to decide on this year, Bloomberg reported on April 21. “Everything from XRP, Litecoin and Solana to Penguins, Doge and 2x Melania and everything in between,” Bloomberg ETF analyst James Balchunas said in an X post. “Gonna be a wild year.” The recent surge in crypto ETF filings reflects a “spaghetti cannon approach” from issuers testing which products the new SEC leadership might approve, fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said in February. “Issuers will try to launch many many different things and see what sticks,” Seyffart said.

In a post on the social media platform X, McGlone says the US has a “self-correcting mechanism” that may push back against President Trump’s tariff war, which could create market chaos. The analyst shares a chart suggesting that the S&P 500 vs. GDP ratio and the S&P 500 vs. gold ratio are both at elevated levels – a setup that has historically marked stock market crashes, such as in the 1930s, the late 1990s, and 2008. Such an event, or “reversion,” could result in significant drops in stocks, Bitcoin oil, copper and bonds, according to McGlone. “America’s self-correcting mechanism is unstoppable. If unprecedented tariffs and austerity don’t work, pushback will come in the next elections. If the great rebalance attempt works, it could reset world order underpinnings for the coming century. The problem is that the discombobulation is coming with US stock market cap vs. GDP and the rest of the world, the highest in about 100 years. My normal reversion base case: – 50% drawdown in the US stock market – $40 a barrel crude oil – $3 per pound copper – 3% US 10-year yield – $10,000 Bitcoin, 90% drawdowns in most of the millions of cryptocurrencies – $4,000 gold, the outlier due to not being simple reversion” Source: Mike McGlone/X While McGlone’s predicted drawdowns appear severe, the analyst says that the magnitude of the potential downside moves is “normal” based on historical terms.

Internet Computer’s pricing has been particularly erratic, experiencing significant ups and downs, which has kept the trading community engaged and alert for any signs of a stable trend. Concurrently, VeChain has captured attention following a strategic breakthrough in Europe and a new listing on a prominent crypto exchange. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) has made headlines with its announcement to distribute 10,000 mining rigs before its network is officially live, signaling a robust initiative that could redefine mining efficiency and profitability with its new X30 and X100 models. Volatile Week for ICP Amid Market Uncertainties The past week for Internet Computer (ICP) has been marked by a rollercoaster of price movements. Starting with a steep decline of over 9% to a low of $4.58 last Sunday, the coin then saw a spike to $4.99 midweek, suggesting a potential recovery. However, this rebound proved to be fleeting as the price regressed to $4.75 by Tuesday. The coin experienced some uplift again on Friday and Saturday, only to face downturns as the new week commenced. The price of ICP currently stands at about $4.72, with traders and financers watching closely for any decisive movements that could indicate a more sustained directional trend. VeChain’s Outlook Improves with New Regulations and Listing VeChain has recently experienced a surge in market activity and financer interest, primarily fueled by its recent achievements. It was listed on the Bybit exchange and secured a MiCAR license, enabling it to expand operations across the European Union. These developments drove the coin’s price to a peak of $0.025, breaking from a persistent downward trend. Although the price has retreated slightly to $0.022, the technical outlook remains positive. The Money Flow Index shows increased buying pressure, and a bullish MACD crossover points to potential further gains. If the market conditions remain favorable and selling pressure is subdued, VeChain’s price could potentially escalate to $0.026 or higher in the near term. BlockDAG Ships 10K Miners Pre-Mainnet- Bigger Steps Bigger Achievements BlockDAG has taken a bold step in the crypto community by announcing the pre-mainnet shipment of 10,000 ASIC miners, as revealed by CEO Antony Turner during Keynote 3. This strategic decision emphasizes the company’s commitment to bolstering its network’s capabilities from the outset, underscoring the significance of these miners in establishing a robust and decentralized consensus model. By ensuring that these high-performance miners are distributed globally before the network officially goes live, BlockDAG is setting the stage for an efficient and powerful mining operation. The X30 and X100 miners are designed to cater to different scales of mining operations: the X30 is suitable for quieter settings like home offices, capable of mining up to 600 BDAG daily, whereas the X100 targets larger operations with the ability to mine up to 2,000 BDAG daily. BlockDAG’s aggressive presale strategy has proven to be immensely successful. The company has so far raised $216 million towards a $600 million goal, with over 19.2 billion coins already sold. The price of the coin has skyrocketed by 2,380% since the initial batch, from $0.001 to $0.0248 in the current 27th batch. This remarkable growth trajectory positions BlockDAG as a leader in the crypto presale space, offering significant early-bird advantages to its financers. Market analysts are keenly observing BlockDAG’s progress as it becomes the most discussed and trendsetting crypto in the industry. The strategic early distribution of mining hardware, combined with the attractive pricing of BDAG coins, sets a promising stage for substantial long-term returns for those engaged in the presale. Final Note As the market dynamics unfold, Internet Computer continues to navigate through its phases of volatility without a clear long-term direction. VeChain, however, appears poised for potential growth, buoyed by significant regulatory and market advancements. BlockDAG stands out with its proactive strategy of shipping 10,000 miners ahead of its mainnet launch, which not only emphasizes its readiness but also showcases its potential for high profitability and impact in the crypto mining sector. This forward-thinking approach by BlockDAG might redefine expectations and operational standards in the cryptocurrency mining industry, making it a focal point for financiers and participants looking towards the future of crypto mining and financing.

The Mantra (OM) crash rattled markets with a dramatic 90% value plunge, triggering confusion and heavy liquidations. Binance issued a statement, but concerns linger—especially with wallet activity revealing major token dumps just ahead of the collapse. On a more hopeful note, the XRP price is under the spotlight again as ETF chatter picks up and some analysts see it climbing to $15. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) is making waves of its own, launching a 600% bonus using the BDAG1200 code. With more buyers rushing in, BDAG’s presale has now topped $216 million, earning it a place among the top crypto to buy right now. Mantra Crash Sends Shockwaves Across Crypto Platforms The Mantra (OM) crash caught the crypto crowd off guard, wiping out nearly 90% of the token’s value within hours. Binance quickly addressed the situation, saying cross-exchange liquidations and a sudden spike in OM supply were key reasons behind the plunge. Blockchain trackers identified 17 wallets that dumped $227 million in OM tokens just before the nosedive. The fallout left many traders in the red, with over $66 million in liquidations recorded in less than half a day. While Binance had previously flagged OM’s tokenomics and limited leverage options, those efforts weren’t enough to prevent the chaos. Even though BNB wasn’t directly affected, the Mantra crash has raised fresh concerns about transparency and the need for better safeguards in volatile markets. XRP Price Prediction Gains Steam With ETF Buzz XRP is back in focus, with a fresh round of ETF speculation adding fuel to its price outlook. Analyst Zach Rector recently argued that a $4 billion ETF inflow could potentially push the XRP price up by 597%, sending it to $15. He cited a valuation model that connects inflows with past price movements, suggesting even modest investments could make a big impact. Currently hovering near $2.07, XRP has room to grow, especially if ETF filings gain traction by the end of the year. Some remain skeptical, pointing to past rejections of altcoin-based ETFs. Still, momentum is building, especially after Brazil approved a spot XRP ETF and U.S. financial firms lined up with similar proposals. BlockDAG’s 600% Bonus Offer Draws Huge Crowds BlockDAG’s presale is heating up, and a big part of the buzz is thanks to the BDAG1200 code, unlocking a massive 600% bonus. At just $0.0248 per coin, early buyers have already seen eye-popping returns of 2,380%. That kind of growth has sparked a rush of interest, pushing the presale past $216 million. Over 19.3 billion tokens have already been snapped up, and batch 27 is moving fast. But this 600% bonus offer won’t be around forever. Traders who act now can turn a $1,000 purchase into $7,000 worth of BDAG just by using the BDAG1200 code. And if BlockDAG hits the $20 mark by 2027, as some forecasts suggest, that $7,000 could explode into $5.6 million. Even without the bonus, a $1,000 purchase would still climb to over $806,000—but let’s be real, why settle for thousands when you could be staring down millions? It’s easy to see why BlockDAG is being called the top crypto to buy right now. With each passing day, momentum builds, and the BDAG1200 code is quickly becoming the must-use entry point for anyone aiming for sky-high gains. What’s Next? The Mantra (OM) crash has left many asking hard questions about token distribution and exchange responsibility after such a steep single-day fall. Meanwhile, the XRP price continues to gain attention as hopes rise around possible ETF approval and what that could mean for a jump to $15. Amid the chaos and speculation, BlockDAG keeps attracting interest. Its BDAG1200 code is creating serious buzz, especially among those hunting for life-altering returns. With $216 million raised so far and early backers already seeing 2,380% ROI, BlockDAG is shaping up to be the top crypto to buy, especially before the bonus deal ends.

If you’ve been keenly watching the market, especially the buzz around crypto Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), then you’re in for some potentially game-changing news. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently sitting on a mountain of decisions – a whopping 72 crypto-related ETF applications to be precise! This revelation, shared via X (formerly Twitter), suggests that 2024 could be a landmark year for crypto ETFs, and we’re here to break down what this all means for you. Why 72 Pending Crypto ETFs is a Big Deal? Seventy-two. Let that number sink in. That’s not just a handful; it’s a significant wave of interest in bringing cryptocurrency investments to the traditional stock market through ETFs. For years, the crypto community has been anticipating the arrival of a Bitcoin spot ETF in the US, viewing it as a watershed moment for mainstream adoption. While spot Bitcoin ETFs have finally been approved earlier this year, the sheer volume of pending applications signals a broader trend – the financial industry is betting big on crypto, and they want to offer investors more ways to get involved. What exactly are these 72 crypto-related ETFs? Spot Bitcoin ETFs: Following the initial approvals, there are likely applications for new entrants or variations of existing spot Bitcoin ETFs. Spot Ethereum ETFs: Ethereum is the next big crypto asset in line, and anticipation is building for spot Ether ETFs. Many of these 72 applications likely pertain to Ethereum. Thematic Crypto ETFs: Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, expect to see ETFs focused on broader crypto themes like the Metaverse, Web3, DeFi (Decentralized Finance), and specific sectors within the crypto ecosystem. Futures-based Crypto ETFs: While futures-based Bitcoin ETFs already exist, there might be applications for ETFs based on other crypto futures, or variations on the existing structures. Inverse and Leveraged Crypto ETFs: For more sophisticated investors, there could be applications for ETFs that allow betting against crypto or amplifying returns (and risks). SEC Decision : The Gatekeeper to Crypto ETFs The SEC plays a crucial role in this entire process. As the regulatory body overseeing securities markets in the United States, the SEC decision is the ultimate hurdle for any ETF to clear before it can be listed and traded on exchanges. The SEC’s mandate is to protect investors, maintain fair and orderly markets, and facilitate capital formation. When it comes to crypto, the SEC has historically been cautious, citing concerns about: Market Manipulation: The nascent and sometimes volatile nature of crypto markets raises concerns about potential manipulation. Investor Protection: Ensuring investors understand the risks associated with crypto assets is paramount. Custody and Security: Safeguarding the underlying crypto assets held by ETFs is a critical consideration. The fact that 72 applications are pending suggests a significant workload for the SEC. It also indicates that despite past hesitations, the SEC is actively engaging with the crypto ETF space. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in the year can be seen as a major step forward, signaling a potential shift in the SEC’s stance. The Potential Impact of ETF Approvals If a significant portion of these 72 crypto ETF applications get the green light, the impact on the crypto market could be profound. Let’s explore some potential benefits: Benefit Description Increased Accessibility ETFs make crypto investments accessible to a wider range of investors, including those who may be hesitant to directly buy and manage digital assets. They can invest through traditional brokerage accounts. Enhanced Liquidity ETFs traded on major exchanges provide greater liquidity compared to holding the underlying cryptocurrencies directly, potentially leading to tighter spreads and easier trading. Institutional Adoption ETFs can pave the way for greater institutional investment in crypto. Many institutions are restricted from directly holding digital assets but can invest in ETFs. Market Maturation Increased ETF activity can contribute to the overall maturation and legitimization of the cryptocurrency market in the eyes of traditional finance. Price Discovery ETFs can improve price discovery by providing a regulated and transparent trading venue for crypto assets. ETF Approval : What’s Next and What to Watch For? While the sheer number of pending applications is exciting, ETF approval is not guaranteed. The SEC will meticulously review each application, considering factors like market surveillance, custody solutions, and the overall risk profile of the proposed ETF. Here’s what to keep an eye on: SEC Timelines: Pay close attention to SEC deadlines and announcements related to ETF applications. The SEC has specific timeframes for reviewing applications, and any extensions or delays can be significant. Analyst Insights: Follow experts like Eric Balchunas and other ETF analysts for their perspectives on the likelihood of approvals and potential timelines. Their insights can provide valuable context. Market Sentiment: Overall market sentiment towards crypto and regulatory developments will play a role. Positive developments and increasing institutional interest can increase the chances of approvals. Regulatory Clarity: Any further regulatory clarity from the SEC or other government bodies regarding crypto assets will be crucial in paving the way for more ETF approvals. Navigating the Crypto ETF Landscape For investors, the potential wave of cryptocurrency ETFs presents both opportunities and considerations: Diversification: ETFs can offer a diversified way to gain exposure to the crypto market, potentially spreading risk compared to investing in individual cryptocurrencies. Due Diligence: Understand the underlying assets of any crypto ETF you consider. Is it focused on Bitcoin, Ethereum, a broader basket of cryptos, or a specific theme? Expense Ratios: Pay attention to the expense ratios of ETFs, as these fees can impact your overall returns. Risk Assessment: Remember that crypto investments are inherently volatile and risky. ETFs don’t eliminate these risks, they simply provide a different way to access the market. Conclusion: An Eventful Year Ahead for Crypto ETFs? Eric Balchunas’ report of 72 pending crypto ETF applications at the SEC paints a picture of a potentially transformative year for the crypto investment landscape. While approvals are not guaranteed, the sheer volume of applications and the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs suggest a growing momentum. Keep a close watch on SEC decisions , analyst insights, and market developments as we navigate what promises to be a very eventful period for crypto ETFs. The coming months could very well shape the future of how investors access and engage with the world of digital assets.

An AI doctoral candidate in California has become the latest victim of what appears to be an aggressive crackdown on student visas , throwing their academic aspirations and immigration status into turmoil. This incident raises critical questions about the future of international talent in the US and the potential ripple effects on innovation across sectors, including cryptocurrency and decentralized technologies. Why is the US Suddenly Revoking Student Visas? Imagine pursuing your dreams, contributing to cutting-edge research, and suddenly finding your foundation pulled out from under you. That’s the reality for an anonymous AI doctoral candidate in California. Speaking to Bitcoin World, this student revealed their SEVIS record – the digital cornerstone of their student visa – was abruptly terminated. The reason? A criminal records check flagged them, despite having no actual criminal history. This student, who has dedicated nearly a decade to studying in the US, believes a past minor police interaction, even predating their graduate studies, might be the culprit. This alarming situation is not isolated. Reports indicate over a thousand international students US have faced similar visa challenges recently, driven by a stricter stance from the State Department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. How Does This Impact the AI Talent Pipeline? The ramifications of these visa revocations extend far beyond individual students. Yisong Yue, a machine learning professor at Caltech, warns of the severe damage to the talent pipeline . In an interview with Bitcoin World, Yue emphasized that this hardline immigration policy is making the US a less attractive destination for top researchers. Consider these points: Research Setbacks: Highly specialized research projects in AI can be derailed for months or even years when doctoral students are suddenly removed. Brain Drain: Talented researchers are reconsidering the US, potentially leading to a loss of innovation and expertise. Widespread Anxiety: The uncertainty is creating fear and instability among the entire community of international students US . This isn’t just about academia; it’s about the future of technological advancement. The US has long benefited from global talent, particularly in fields like AI, which are crucial for progress in areas like blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies. Examples of Impacted Students: Who is Affected? The crackdown isn’t discriminating. Students from diverse institutions, ranging from Ivy League universities to public colleges and small liberal arts schools, have been affected. While some accusations involve serious allegations, like supporting militant groups, others are bafflingly minor. Here are a few examples illustrating the breadth of the issue: Student Case Institution Issue Outcome Anonymous AI Doctoral Candidate California University Unspecified “criminal record” (likely minor past police interaction) Visa revoked, status at risk Suguru Onda (Computer Science PhD) Brigham Young University Unspecified reason for revocation Visa reinstated after legal action, no explanation given ~100 International Students Various (Georgia) Unspecified reasons for revocation Temporary restraining order issued, visas reinstated (for now) These cases suggest a systemic issue, possibly linked to automated AI screening without adequate human oversight, as suggested by attorney Adam Crayk. The lack of transparency and recourse leaves international students US in a precarious position. Why Should the Crypto World Care About Student Visa Issues? You might be wondering, what does this have to do with cryptocurrency? The answer is: everything. The AI revolution is deeply intertwined with the future of blockchain and crypto. Many breakthroughs in AI are driven by international talent studying in the US. Consider these key contributions: Transformer Architecture: Ashish Vaswani, co-creator of the transformer (powering models like ChatGPT), came to the US as an international student US . OpenAI Co-founder: Wojciech Zaremba, a co-founder of OpenAI, earned his AI doctorate in the US on a student visa . Furthermore, international students US are a significant economic force, contributing $43.8 billion to the US economy and supporting over 378,000 jobs in the 2023-2024 academic year alone, according to NAFSA. A weakened talent pipeline in AI directly impacts the innovation ecosystem that fuels advancements in crypto and blockchain technologies. What’s the Future for International AI Talent in the US? The current climate is causing serious concern among leading AI researchers. Professor Yue notes that senior AI researchers, including professors at top universities and researchers at companies like OpenAI and Google, are worried about their future in the US. The aggressive immigration policy risks turning the US into a less desirable hub for global talent, potentially hindering progress in critical technological fields. The long-term consequences for US leadership in AI and related fields like crypto could be significant.

43644220,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=151214,1745281841,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Significant Milestone: Metaplanet Joins OTCQX Billion Plus Index,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/metaplanet-joins-otcqx-billion-index/,"In a noteworthy development for the cryptocurrency market, Metaplanet Inc. (OTCQX: MTPLF), a publicly traded company making waves in Japan, has officially been included in the prestigious OTCQX Billion+ Index. This exciting announcement, shared by CEO Simon Gerovich on X (formerly Twitter), marks a significant achievement for Metaplanet and underscores the growing institutional interest in crypto-related equities. But what does this inclusion truly mean, and why should investors and crypto enthusiasts alike pay attention? Let’s dive into the details. What is the OTCQX Billion Plus Index and Why Does it Matter for Crypto Stocks? The OTCQX Billion Plus Index is not just another list; it’s a benchmark of success in the over-the-counter (OTC) market. It specifically tracks the performance of companies listed on the OTCQX Best Market that boast a market capitalization exceeding $1 billion. Inclusion in this index is a testament to a company’s scale, investor confidence, and overall market presence. For crypto stocks like Metaplanet, being part of the Billion+ Index carries several important implications: Enhanced Visibility and Credibility: Joining the index elevates Metaplanet’s profile among institutional investors and the broader financial community. It signals that the company has reached a significant level of maturity and market value, making it a more attractive prospect for investment portfolios. Increased Investor Interest: The OTCQX Billion+ Index is closely watched by funds and investors seeking exposure to established and high-growth OTC companies. Metaplanet’s inclusion could lead to increased trading volume and potentially drive further appreciation in its stock price. Benchmark for Performance: The index serves as a valuable benchmark for Metaplanet’s performance. It allows investors to compare Metaplanet’s growth and stock movements against a curated group of successful OTCQX-listed companies. Think of it like this: getting into the OTCQX Billion+ Index is akin to a startup graduating from seed funding to Series B. It’s a clear signal of progress and potential. Metaplanet OTCQX: A Deep Dive into the Japanese Market Metaplanet OTCQX , trading under the ticker MTPLF, is a fascinating case study in the evolving landscape of crypto adoption in Asia, specifically within the Japanese market . While headquartered in Hong Kong, Metaplanet has strategically focused its operations and investment activities in Japan. This focus is particularly noteworthy given Japan’s relatively progressive regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies and its strong technological infrastructure. Here’s a breakdown of why Metaplanet’s presence in the Japanese market is significant: Japan’s Crypto-Friendly Regulations: Japan was one of the first major economies to formally recognize Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as legal property. The country has established a clear regulatory framework, which, while strict, provides a level of certainty and legitimacy for crypto businesses operating within its borders. This supportive environment is conducive to growth and innovation in the crypto space. Strong Technological Infrastructure: Japan boasts a highly developed technological infrastructure and a digitally savvy population. This provides a fertile ground for the adoption and integration of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies into various sectors. Strategic Geographic Location: Japan serves as a gateway to the broader Asian market, which is a global powerhouse in terms of both traditional finance and the burgeoning crypto economy. Metaplanet’s foothold in Japan positions it strategically to tap into this vast and dynamic market. Metaplanet’s decision to concentrate on the Japanese market reflects a savvy understanding of global crypto dynamics and regulatory landscapes. It’s not just about being in crypto; it’s about being in the right crypto market. The Rise of Crypto Stocks and Institutional Investment Metaplanet’s inclusion in the OTCQX Billion+ Index is also indicative of a broader trend: the increasing prominence of crypto stocks and the growing influx of institutional investment into the digital asset space. For years, cryptocurrency investment was largely dominated by retail investors and early adopters. However, we are now witnessing a significant shift as institutional players – hedge funds, asset managers, and even corporations – are starting to allocate capital to crypto assets and related equities. Several factors are driving this institutional wave: Factor Description Maturing Market: The cryptocurrency market is becoming more mature with increased liquidity, improved infrastructure, and a growing track record. This reduces perceived risk and makes it more palatable for institutional investors. Inflationary Concerns: Amidst concerns about inflation and currency devaluation, institutional investors are seeking alternative assets like Bitcoin and crypto stocks to hedge against traditional market risks. Potential for High Returns: Despite volatility, cryptocurrencies and related equities offer the potential for significant returns, which is attractive to institutional investors looking to outperform benchmarks. Client Demand: Many institutional investors are responding to increasing client demand for crypto exposure. As more individuals and businesses express interest in digital assets, institutions are compelled to offer related investment products. Metaplanet’s ascent to the OTCQX Billion+ Index is a tangible example of how institutional interest is validating and propelling the growth of companies operating in the crypto ecosystem. It’s a signal that crypto is no longer a fringe asset class but is increasingly becoming integrated into mainstream finance. Billion Plus Index: What are the Benefits for Metaplanet? Being part of the Billion Plus Index is not just a symbolic victory for Metaplanet; it unlocks tangible benefits that can further fuel its growth trajectory. Let’s explore some key advantages: Lower Cost of Capital: Increased visibility and investor confidence can translate to a lower cost of capital for Metaplanet. This can be crucial for funding future expansion, acquisitions, or strategic initiatives. Attracting Top Talent: A company recognized for its market capitalization and index inclusion becomes more attractive to top-tier talent. Metaplanet can leverage its Billion+ Index status to recruit skilled professionals who are seeking to work for successful and high-profile organizations. Strategic Partnerships: Index inclusion can enhance Metaplanet’s credibility when seeking strategic partnerships with other businesses, financial institutions, or technology providers. It strengthens its negotiating position and opens doors to collaborative opportunities. Validation of Business Model: Inclusion in the Billion+ Index serves as external validation of Metaplanet’s business model and strategic direction. It reinforces the company’s narrative and builds trust with stakeholders. These benefits are not just theoretical; they are practical advantages that can contribute to Metaplanet’s long-term success and sustainability in the competitive crypto landscape. Challenges and Future Outlook for Metaplanet and Crypto Stocks While Metaplanet’s inclusion in the OTCQX Billion+ Index is a cause for celebration, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges and the road ahead. The crypto stocks market, while promising, is still subject to volatility and regulatory uncertainties. Metaplanet, like other companies in this space, will need to navigate these complexities to sustain its growth. Key challenges include: Regulatory Scrutiny: Cryptocurrency regulations are still evolving globally. Changes in regulations, particularly in Japan or other key markets, could impact Metaplanet’s operations and growth prospects. Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Fluctuations in crypto prices can directly affect the value of Metaplanet’s holdings and its stock price. Competition: The crypto space is becoming increasingly competitive. Metaplanet will need to continuously innovate and adapt to maintain its edge and market position. Economic Downturns: Broader economic downturns can impact investor sentiment and risk appetite, potentially affecting investment in crypto stocks and the overall market capitalization of companies like Metaplanet. Looking ahead, Metaplanet’s ability to address these challenges while capitalizing on the opportunities presented by the growing institutional investment trend will be crucial. The company’s strategic focus on the Japanese market, its inclusion in the OTCQX Billion+ Index, and its proactive approach to navigating the crypto landscape position it favorably for continued growth. However, vigilance and adaptability will remain paramount. Conclusion: A Triumph for Metaplanet and a Positive Sign for Crypto Metaplanet Inc.’s entry into the OTCQX Billion+ Index is more than just a company milestone; it’s a triumph that reflects the maturation of the cryptocurrency market and the increasing acceptance of crypto-related investments within mainstream finance. This achievement underscores the potential of Japanese market as a hub for crypto innovation and highlights the growing influence of institutional investment in shaping the future of digital assets. For investors, industry observers, and crypto enthusiasts, Metaplanet’s success story serves as a compelling example of the evolving landscape and the exciting possibilities that lie ahead. As Metaplanet continues to navigate the dynamic world of crypto, its journey will be closely watched as a bellwether for the broader crypto stock market and the ongoing integration of digital assets into the global financial system.

The pattern in question is a Triangle, which forms when an asset consolidates between two converging trendlines. The upper trendline is likely to act as a source of resistance in the future, while the lower one can provide support. Just like in many other TA consolidation patterns, a break beyond either of these lines can imply a continuation of the trend in that direction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mega Whales Keep Buying—Is Rest Of Market Finally Catching Up? The trendlines being convergent means that as the price travels inside this type of consolidation channel, its range gets progressively narrower, until it compresses down to a point. There are a few different types of Triangles in TA. The most popular variants include the Ascending, Descending, and Symmetrical Triangles. In the context of the current topic, the relevant Triangle is closest to the third of these. In this pattern, trendlines converge with each other at a roughly equal and opposite slope toward a midpoint. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Triangle that Cardano was trading inside until the past day. As is visible in the graph, Cardano had been moving inside this Triangle for almost three weeks, before a break arrived in the past day. Just prior to the break, the coin had nearly approached the apex of the triangle, meaning its consolidation had turned very tight. Generally, as an asset’s range becomes narrower, a breakout becomes more likely. Yesterday, before ADA found its break, the analyst had shared the same chart for the Triangle, noting the stage was set for a move. Martinez had noted that this move could potentially be a swing to equal to 27%, based on the height of the Triangle from the lowest price bottom. The question was which direction the breakout might occur in. In Symmetrical Triangles, a breakout is equally likely in both directions. The Triangle that Cardano had been following wasn’t a perfect Symmetrical Triangle, though, as it had a slight ascending bias to it. This means that a break toward the upside may have been more probable, although only slightly. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Bear Confirmation Is Yet To Appear, Glassnode Reveals This slight advantage in likelihood seems to have worked out for ADA this time, as its price has now witnessed a surge above the upper resistance line. It now remains to be seen whether this move would grow into a 27% one that the Triangle’s height hints at or not. ADA Price At the time of writing, Cardano is floating around $0.64, up more than 4% in the last seven days.

The Bitcoin world is buzzing with news of a monumental financial victory. Michael Saylor, the unwavering Bitcoin advocate and founder of MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), has just dropped a bombshell on X – his company has raked in a jaw-dropping $459 million gain this month alone! Yes, you read that right. Through their strategic treasury management, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings are paying off in a big, BIG way. Let’s dive into the details of this incredible win and what it means for the future of corporate Bitcoin adoption. Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Bet: A Masterclass in Treasury Management For those unfamiliar, MicroStrategy, under Michael Saylor’s leadership, has become synonymous with corporate Bitcoin adoption. They aren’t just dipping their toes in the water; they’ve plunged headfirst, making Bitcoin their primary treasury reserve asset. This bold strategy, spearheaded by Saylor, has often been met with both praise and skepticism. But this latest announcement? It’s a resounding validation of their conviction. Why is this $459 million gain so significant? Massive Profit in Short Time: A $459 million gain in a single month is not just impressive; it’s exceptional. It showcases the potential for substantial returns when Bitcoin’s price appreciates, especially for companies holding significant amounts. Strategic Treasury Management Vindicated: Saylor’s strategy of using Bitcoin as a treasury reserve is no longer just a theoretical concept. It’s delivering real, tangible financial benefits to MicroStrategy and its shareholders. Confidence Booster for Corporate Bitcoin Adoption: This win could serve as a powerful example for other corporations considering Bitcoin as part of their treasury strategy. It demonstrates the upside potential and could encourage further institutional investment in Bitcoin. Decoding MicroStrategy’s Recent Bitcoin Purchase: The $555.8 Million Investment To fully grasp the context of this massive gain, let’s rewind a bit. MicroStrategy recently announced another significant Bitcoin purchase. Between April 14th and April 20th, they acquired a further 6,556 BTC at an average price of $84,785, totaling a whopping $555.8 million. Let’s break down this purchase: Metric Details Bitcoin Purchased 6,556 BTC Purchase Period April 14th – April 20th Average Price per BTC $84,785 Total Investment $555.8 Million This purchase, while substantial, might raise eyebrows considering the average price. However, Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy are playing the long game. They view Bitcoin as a long-term store of value, and short-term price fluctuations are likely seen as opportunities rather than deterrents. How Does This $459M Gain Impact MicroStrategy (MSTR) and its Investors? The $459 million gain is undoubtedly a shot in the arm for MicroStrategy (MSTR) and its investors. Here’s a look at the potential impacts: Shareholder Value Surge: As Saylor explicitly stated, this gain directly benefits shareholders. Increased profitability and a stronger balance sheet can translate to higher stock value and investor confidence in MSTR. Enhanced Financial Position: The substantial gain strengthens MicroStrategy’s financial position, providing them with greater flexibility for future investments and operations. Market Validation: This financial success story further validates MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy in the eyes of the market. It could attract more investors who are now seeing the tangible benefits of Bitcoin exposure through MSTR. Potential for Further Bitcoin Accumulation: With such significant gains, MicroStrategy may be even more inclined to continue accumulating Bitcoin in the future, further solidifying their position as a leading corporate Bitcoin holder. Michael Saylor’s Vision: More Than Just Profit? While the $459 million gain is undeniably impressive, Michael Saylor’s vision for Bitcoin extends beyond mere profit. He is a vocal advocate for Bitcoin as a transformative technology and a superior store of value compared to traditional assets. His strategy isn’t just about short-term gains; it’s about positioning MicroStrategy for long-term success in a world increasingly embracing digital assets. Is MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy without risks? Of course not. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate significantly, and while this month brought a massive gain, future periods could see downturns. However, MicroStrategy appears to be comfortable with this volatility, viewing it as part of the long-term Bitcoin investment journey. Key Challenges and Considerations: Bitcoin Volatility: The very nature of Bitcoin’s price fluctuations means that gains are not guaranteed and losses are possible. MicroStrategy’s strategy carries inherent market risk. Regulatory Landscape: The evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies globally could pose challenges or uncertainties for companies holding Bitcoin as treasury assets. Accounting Standards: Accounting for Bitcoin holdings and gains/losses can be complex and subject to evolving standards, which companies like MicroStrategy need to navigate carefully. Actionable Insights: What Can We Learn from MicroStrategy’s Success? MicroStrategy’s $459 million gain offers several key takeaways for businesses and investors: Bitcoin as a Treasury Asset: It strengthens the argument for considering Bitcoin as a viable treasury reserve asset, especially for companies seeking to diversify their holdings and potentially enhance returns. Long-Term Vision is Crucial: MicroStrategy’s success is rooted in a long-term vision and conviction in Bitcoin’s potential. Short-term market noise should not derail a well-considered Bitcoin strategy. Risk Management is Essential: While the gains are enticing, understanding and managing the risks associated with Bitcoin volatility is paramount. A robust risk management framework is crucial for any company considering Bitcoin exposure. Stay Informed and Adaptable: The crypto space is dynamic. Staying informed about market trends, regulatory developments, and technological advancements is vital for navigating this evolving landscape successfully. Conclusion: A Testament to Bitcoin’s Potential and Strategic Vision MicroStrategy’s staggering $459 million gain this month is more than just a financial windfall; it’s a powerful testament to the potential of Bitcoin and the strategic vision of Michael Saylor. It underscores the viability of Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset and could serve as a catalyst for further institutional adoption. While challenges and risks remain inherent in the crypto market, MicroStrategy’s success story offers a compelling example of the remarkable opportunities that strategic Bitcoin adoption can unlock. The world will be watching closely to see what Saylor and MicroStrategy do next in their ongoing Bitcoin journey.

Currently in its presale phase, MUTM is priced at $0.025, with projections suggesting a potential surge to $2.50 post-launch, a nearly 10,000% increase. This optimism is fueled by the platform’s innovative dual-lending model, combining Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems, which enhances flexibility and security in decentralized finance (DeFi) lending. The project has already attracted over 8,400 investors, raising more than $7 million, and is offering incentives such as a $100,000 token giveaway to further boost community engagement. As the crypto market evolves, many investors are looking beyond traditional assets, considering emerging tokens like MUTM for their potential high returns. The Mutuum Finance team has unveiled a new dashboard with a leaderboard that ranks the top 50 holders, who will be rewarded with bonus tokens for staying in the top 50 positions. Mutuum Finance Presale Takes Off The decentralized finance (DeFi) market adopts Mutuum Finance because of its innovative crypto lending approach which has gained fast momentum. More than 8,400 investors have participated in the project’s unique approach through which they poured $7 million of capital. Phase 4 features a $0.025 token price with a brief entry period that ends when prices rise 20% because it marks the termination of early investment possibilities. Investors participating in the presale phase can get an enormous 140% ROI by purchasing the token at $0.06. The decentralized finance sector keeps expanding while Mutuum Finance emerges as the leading pioneer which brings innovative lending strategies and solid market leadership. Mutuum Finance utilizes CertiK to conduct an audit of their platform security which will receive publication on their social media channels afterwards. CertiK will audit the platform after completion before the official report gets published on their social media platforms for public transparency and trust. Shaking Up Crypto Lending through a Dual-Model Approach Mutuum Finance is redefining crypto lending by interweaving two dominant models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The P2C model allows users to contribute stablecoins to liquidity pools managed by smart contracts, earning passive income with instant borrowing availability for platform players. Even interest rates are adjusted automatically by the smart contracts to maximize lenders’ returns and lower borrowing costs. The P2P model takes decentralization to the level of eliminating third parties, allowing borrowers and lenders to directly interact. This provides users with the option to negotiate individualized loan agreements, facilitating higher transparency and an intuitive borrowing experience. Through the Ethereum blockchain the platform stablecoin reaches price stability by using reserve-backed USD. The configuration works as a risk management system for algorithmic stablecoins to secure safe and reliable financial transactions. Mutuum Finance constructs the foundation of future decentralized finance by uniting emerging lending schemes with a solid infrastructure. The MUTM Giveaway As part of its community-building initiative, Mutuum Finance is running an engaging giveaway campaign, offering away $100,000 worth of MUTM tokens. Ten lucky users will receive $10,000 worth of tokens each. The new referral program for the platform also compensates users who bring in new investors. Users also receive access to exclusive staking pools, governance rights, and platform updates, encouraging long-term devotion and loyalty to the platform. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to attract investors through its $0.025 presale token price which demonstrates potential to increase by 10,000% after its launch. The project has attracted $7M from 8400+ investors owing to the backing of groups who successfully predicted XRP and Pepe (PEPE). The dual-lending model of the platform provides multiple security options for users in decentralized finance. The MUTM token project continues to gain speed through its $100,000 token giveaway program combined with benefits for investors who increase their contributions to the project. Investors should participate in the current presale phase to secure maximum returns because prices will eventually increase.

It’s a question on every crypto enthusiast’s mind. We often assume big players entering the Bitcoin arena will send prices soaring. But new research from TD Cowen throws a fascinating curveball into this narrative, suggesting that despite significant Bitcoin buys by Strategy, the actual impact on market prices has been surprisingly minimal. Let’s dive deep into this crypto market analysis and see what’s really going on. Decoding Strategy’s Bitcoin Buys: A Drop in the Ocean? Strategy, a publicly traded company, has become well-known for its substantial investments in Bitcoin. We’re talking billions of dollars worth of BTC. You’d think such large purchases would create significant ripples in the market, right? TD Cowen’s research, however, paints a different picture. Their findings indicate that Strategy’s weekly Bitcoin acquisitions only account for a small fraction of the overall market activity. Minimal Volume Impact: On average, Strategy’s Bitcoin buys represented just 3.3% of the total weekly trading volume. This is a relatively small percentage, suggesting that the vast majority of Bitcoin trading activity is driven by other factors. Low Price Correlation: The correlation between Strategy’s Bitcoin purchases and Bitcoin price movements is surprisingly weak. Only a 25% correlation was observed with price levels and a mere 28% with price changes. This suggests that Strategy’s buying activity is not a strong predictor of Bitcoin price fluctuations. Secondary Market Dominance: While Strategy’s purchases sometimes exceed the newly mined Bitcoin supply, the report emphasizes that the secondary market is significantly larger. This robust secondary market activity effectively dilutes the price-setting influence of even large buyers like Strategy. In essence, while Strategy is accumulating a significant amount of Bitcoin, their buying power, in the grand scheme of the global crypto market analysis , appears to be less impactful than many might assume. The Bitcoin market is vast and liquid, capable of absorbing even large buy orders without experiencing dramatic price swings directly attributable to those purchases. Why Aren’t Strategy’s Buys Moving Market Prices? Several factors contribute to this phenomenon. The Bitcoin market has matured significantly over the years. It’s no longer the nascent, easily swayed market of its early days. Increased liquidity, the participation of institutional investors, and a broader global trading landscape all contribute to a more resilient and less volatile market. Here’s a breakdown of why institutional investment from Strategy isn’t causing major price pumps: Market Maturity: The Bitcoin market is far more mature and liquid than it was even a few years ago. This increased depth means larger trades are absorbed more easily without causing dramatic price fluctuations. Diverse Market Participants: The Bitcoin market is now populated by a diverse range of participants, from retail investors to hedge funds, corporations, and even governments. No single entity, even with substantial buying power, can easily dominate the market. Global Trading: Bitcoin trading occurs 24/7 across numerous exchanges worldwide. This global and continuous trading activity further dilutes the impact of any single buyer’s actions. Hedging and Derivatives Markets: Sophisticated hedging strategies and the existence of Bitcoin derivatives markets allow for price discovery and risk management that can dampen the immediate price impact of spot market purchases. The Silver Lining: Strategy’s BTC Holdings and Shareholder Value While Strategy’s Bitcoin buys might not be dramatically impacting market prices in the short term, the research highlights a significant positive outcome for the company itself. Since early 2023, Strategy’s BTC holdings have surged by an impressive 306%. This substantial appreciation in their Bitcoin portfolio has translated into strong shareholder value. This growth in BTC holdings demonstrates that even if large purchases don’t immediately pump the entire market, strategic Bitcoin investments can still be highly beneficial for individual companies. Strategy’s case is a prime example of how corporations can leverage Bitcoin as a treasury asset to enhance shareholder value, even in a market where their buying power is diluted by broader trading activity. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what can crypto investors learn from this crypto market analysis ? Don’t Overestimate Individual Buyer Impact: Be wary of narratives that suggest a single large purchase will trigger massive price rallies. The Bitcoin market is complex and influenced by numerous factors. Focus on Broader Market Trends: Pay attention to overall market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, regulatory developments, and technological advancements in the crypto space. These broader trends are likely to have a more significant impact on Bitcoin prices than individual company buys. Long-Term Investment Perspective: Strategy’s success underscores the potential of Bitcoin as a long-term investment. While short-term market pumps might be elusive, strategic accumulation of Bitcoin can yield substantial returns over time. Company-Specific Benefits of Bitcoin: For businesses, Bitcoin can serve as a valuable treasury asset, offering diversification and potential for capital appreciation, even if their buying activity doesn’t single-handedly move the market. The Takeaway: Subtlety in the Bitcoin Market TD Cowen’s research provides a valuable reality check in the often-hyped world of crypto. It reveals that while institutional investment in Bitcoin is undoubtedly growing, the immediate market impact of even substantial purchases can be surprisingly subtle. The Bitcoin market’s maturity and liquidity mean that price movements are driven by a complex interplay of factors, not just the buying activity of a few large players. For investors, this underscores the importance of a nuanced understanding of market dynamics and a focus on long-term trends rather than chasing short-term hype.

The buzz is real, and the excitement is palpable. Coinbase, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has just dropped a bombshell announcement that’s sending ripples through the digital asset space. What’s the scoop? They are listing Reserve Rights token, better known as RSR token ! This is huge news for the RSR community and the broader crypto market alike. Let’s dive into what this Coinbase listing RSR means for you, the token, and the future of decentralized finance. What’s the Hype Around the Coinbase Listing RSR? Coinbase officially announced on X (formerly Twitter) that Reserve Rights (RSR) is coming to their platform. Mark your calendars! Trading is slated to kick off on April 22nd at 9 a.m. ET, provided those all-important liquidity conditions are met. This isn’t just another token listing; it’s a significant milestone for Reserve Rights and a potential game-changer for investors looking to buy RSR . Why is this listing so significant? Let’s break it down: Increased Accessibility: Listing on Coinbase instantly opens up RSR to millions of new users globally. Coinbase is renowned for its user-friendly interface and accessibility, making it easy for both seasoned traders and crypto newbies to get involved. Enhanced Liquidity: A Coinbase listing typically leads to a surge in trading volume and liquidity. This means tighter spreads and easier execution of trades for everyone looking to trade RSR. Boosted Credibility and Exposure: Coinbase is a trusted and regulated exchange. Listing on such a platform lends significant credibility to Reserve Rights, increasing its visibility and attracting institutional and retail investors. Potential Price Surge: Historically, tokens listed on major exchanges like Coinbase often experience a price increase due to increased demand and exposure. While past performance isn’t indicative of future results, the potential for upward price movement is definitely something to consider when thinking about the RSR token price . What Exactly is Reserve Rights (RSR)? For those new to the ecosystem, Reserve Rights token (RSR) is the utility token of the Reserve protocol, a dual-token stablecoin system designed to reduce the risks associated with holding uncollateralized stablecoins and provide a more stable and decentralized financial system. Here’s a simplified look at its core components: Reserve Stablecoin (RSV): This is the stablecoin part of the protocol, designed to maintain a value pegged to the US dollar or other fiat currencies. RSV aims to be a stable and scalable digital currency for everyday use. Reserve Rights (RSR): This is the utility token. RSR holders can stake their tokens to help secure the Reserve system and participate in governance. RSR is also used to recapitalize RSV if it ever loses its peg. Think of it as a token that helps maintain the stability of RSV. The Reserve protocol’s mission is to build a truly decentralized and censorship-resistant financial system, especially for regions where access to stable and reliable currency is limited. The Coinbase listing RSR brings this vision to a wider audience. Why Should You Care About Reserve Rights and its Coinbase Listing? Whether you’re a seasoned crypto trader or just dipping your toes into the digital asset world, the crypto exchange listing of RSR on Coinbase is noteworthy. Here’s why: Diversification Opportunity: RSR offers a unique value proposition within the stablecoin ecosystem. Adding it to your portfolio could be a strategic move for diversification, especially if you believe in the future of decentralized stablecoins. Exposure to DeFi: Reserve Rights is deeply rooted in the principles of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Investing in RSR is, in a way, investing in the broader DeFi movement and its potential to reshape global finance. Potential for Growth: With increased adoption and awareness, the Reserve protocol and RSR token have significant growth potential. The Coinbase listing could be a catalyst for wider adoption and increased value. Supporting a Vision: By holding RSR, you are potentially supporting a project that aims to provide financial stability and access to underserved communities globally. This aligns with the ethos of many in the crypto space who believe in financial inclusion and empowerment. Navigating the Waters: Potential Challenges and Considerations While the Coinbase listing RSR is overwhelmingly positive, it’s crucial to approach it with a balanced perspective. Here are a few points to keep in mind: Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. While listings can trigger positive price action, they are not guarantees of sustained upward movement. Be prepared for potential price swings. Liquidity Requirements: Coinbase mentioned that trading will commence if liquidity requirements are met. While this is likely to be a formality, it’s something to be aware of. Keep an eye on official Coinbase updates. Project Risks: Like any crypto project, Reserve Rights carries inherent risks. Understand the technology, the team, and the competitive landscape before investing. Do your own thorough research (DYOR!). Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving. Changes in regulations could impact the Reserve protocol and RSR. Stay informed about the regulatory developments in the crypto space. Actionable Insights: How to Approach the RSR Coinbase Listing So, you’re intrigued by the Coinbase listing RSR ? Here’s a practical guide on how to approach it: Do Your Research: Before making any investment decisions, delve deeper into Reserve Rights. Understand its whitepaper, technology, team, and roadmap. Websites like CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, and the official Reserve website are great starting points. Monitor Coinbase Announcements: Keep a close watch on Coinbase’s official channels (X, blog, etc.) for any updates regarding the RSR listing, especially concerning the April 22nd launch and liquidity status. Set Realistic Expectations: While there’s potential for price appreciation, avoid FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). The crypto market is unpredictable. Invest responsibly and only what you can afford to lose. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you plan to buy RSR , consider using a DCA strategy. This involves buying a fixed amount of RSR at regular intervals, regardless of the price, which can help mitigate the risks of volatility. Stay Informed: The crypto world moves fast. Stay updated on news and developments related to Reserve Rights and the broader cryptocurrency market. The Bottom Line: A New Chapter for Reserve Rights? The Coinbase listing RSR is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for the Reserve Rights project and its community. It signifies a major step forward in terms of accessibility, credibility, and market reach. While the crypto market is inherently dynamic and unpredictable, this listing presents a golden opportunity for RSR to shine and potentially reach new heights. As always, informed decision-making and responsible investing are key. Keep your eyes peeled on April 22nd and beyond – the journey of RSR on Coinbase is just beginning!

This sharp downturn wasn’t isolated; it was a broad U.S. market sell-off, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also suffering significant losses. Are you concerned about your investments amidst this market volatility? Let’s delve into what triggered this alarming stock market sell-off and what it means for investors like you. Decoding the Nasdaq Drop and Broader Market Correction The day’s trading session painted a stark picture of widespread investor anxiety. Here’s a quick snapshot of how the major indices fared: Index Intraday Drop Nasdaq Composite 3.66% S&P 500 3.37% Dow Jones Industrial Average 3.21% This synchronized decline across all major indices points to a broad-based market correction , suggesting deeper concerns are at play beyond just sector-specific issues. But what exactly fueled this sudden investor exodus? What’s Behind the Sudden Stock Market Sell-Off? Several factors can contribute to a significant stock market sell-off . Understanding these triggers is crucial for investors to make informed decisions. Here are some key elements that likely played a role in today’s market downturn: Rising Interest Rate Concerns: Persistent inflation has raised expectations for further interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Higher interest rates can make borrowing more expensive for companies, potentially slowing down economic growth and impacting corporate earnings. Geopolitical Instability: Global uncertainties, such as ongoing conflicts and rising international tensions, often spook investors, leading them to move towards safer assets and away from equities. Profit Taking: After a period of market gains, some investors may choose to lock in profits, triggering a wave of selling pressure. This can exacerbate a downward trend, especially if triggered by negative news. Economic Data Disappointments: Weaker-than-expected economic data releases can signal a potential slowdown, prompting investors to reassess their risk exposure and potentially reduce their stock holdings. It’s important to note that these factors often intertwine and amplify each other, creating a cascading effect that leads to a significant Nasdaq drop and broader market decline. Navigating Economic Uncertainty: Investor Strategies in a Downturn Periods of economic uncertainty can be unsettling, but they also present opportunities for savvy investors. Here are some strategic approaches to consider during a market downturn: Stay Calm and Avoid Panic Selling: Market corrections are a normal part of the economic cycle. Reacting emotionally and selling investments during a downturn can lock in losses. Review Your Portfolio: Assess your current asset allocation and risk tolerance. Consider rebalancing your portfolio to align with your long-term financial goals. Focus on Long-Term Investments: If you have a long-term investment horizon, market downturns can be opportunities to buy quality stocks at discounted prices. Diversification is Key: A well-diversified portfolio across different asset classes can help mitigate risk during volatile periods. Seek Professional Advice: Consult with a financial advisor to get personalized guidance based on your individual circumstances and investment goals. Remember, market volatility is inherent in investing. Understanding the underlying causes of a Nasdaq drop and developing a sound investment strategy can help you navigate these challenging times and position yourself for long-term financial success. The Impact of Nasdaq Drop on Cryptocurrency Markets While the Nasdaq drop primarily reflects the performance of technology stocks, it’s worth noting the increasing correlation between traditional stock markets and the cryptocurrency market. When the Nasdaq experiences a significant downturn, it can often trigger similar sentiment in the crypto space. Investors should be aware of this interconnectedness. A risk-off sentiment in the stock market can spill over into the crypto market, leading to price volatility in assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Therefore, monitoring traditional market indicators like the Nasdaq is becoming increasingly relevant for cryptocurrency investors as well. Actionable Insights: What Should Investors Do Now? In the face of this market correction , what practical steps can investors take? Do Your Research: Understand the companies and assets you are invested in. Are their long-term fundamentals still strong? Dollar-Cost Averaging: Consider using dollar-cost averaging to invest gradually over time. This can help reduce the risk of investing a lump sum at the wrong time. Cash is King (Sometimes): Holding some cash can provide flexibility to buy assets at lower prices if the market continues to decline. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with market news and economic developments, but avoid being swayed by short-term market noise. Market downturns, while unsettling, are not necessarily indicators of long-term doom. They are often periods of recalibration and can present opportunities for informed and patient investors. Conclusion: Riding the Waves of Market Volatility The recent Nasdaq drop and broader U.S. market sell-off serve as a potent reminder of the inherent volatility in financial markets. While unsettling, these periods of correction are a natural part of the economic cycle. By understanding the underlying factors, staying informed, and adhering to a well-thought-out investment strategy, investors can navigate these turbulent times and emerge stronger in the long run. Don’t let fear dictate your decisions; instead, use knowledge and strategy to weather the storm and position yourself for future growth.

This lead, highlighted on April 21, 2025, by ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, reflects both investor confidence in Bitcoin and the sluggish growth of alternative crypto funds.

The innovative investment firm, known for its forward-thinking strategies, has now included exposure to 3iQ’s Solana Staking ETF (SOLQ) within two of its flagship funds: the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) and the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF). This development signals a significant step towards mainstream adoption of staked cryptocurrencies and underscores the growing institutional interest in Solana and its ecosystem. Let’s dive into what this means for investors and the future of crypto staking . Why is ARK Invest Betting Big on Solana Staking ETF? ARK Invest’s decision to incorporate the Solana Staking ETF into ARKW and ARKF isn’t just a casual addition; it’s a strategic play reflecting the firm’s belief in the long-term potential of blockchain technology and digital assets. ARK Invest has consistently demonstrated a keen eye for disruptive innovation, and their foray into Solana staking via an ETF highlights several key factors: Exposure to Solana’s Growth: Solana is a high-performance blockchain renowned for its speed and scalability. By investing in a Solana Staking ETF , ARK Invest gains exposure to the potential price appreciation of Solana’s native token, SOL. Yield Generation through Staking: The 3iQ Solana Staking ETF (SOLQ) isn’t just about price exposure; it also taps into Solana’s native staking yield. This means investors in ARKW and ARKF will indirectly benefit from the rewards generated by staking Solana, offering a potential source of passive income. Simplified Access to Staking: Staking cryptocurrencies directly can be technically complex and involve managing wallets and nodes. An ETF simplifies this process, providing institutional and retail investors with an accessible and regulated way to participate in Solana staking . Diversification and Innovation: For ARKW and ARKF, adding a Crypto ETF focused on staking diversifies their holdings within the digital asset space. It also aligns with their investment mandate of seeking out innovative and disruptive technologies. Understanding the 3iQ Solana Staking ETF (SOLQ) The product at the heart of this development is 3iQ’s Solana Staking ETF (SOLQ). Let’s break down what makes SOLQ a unique and attractive investment vehicle: Exchange-Traded Product (ETP): SOLQ is an ETP, which means it trades on stock exchanges just like traditional stocks and ETFs. This provides liquidity and ease of access for investors. Linked to Solana’s Price and Staking Yield: The ETF’s value is linked to the price movements of Solana (SOL) and the yield generated from staking SOL tokens. This dual exposure aims to capture both capital appreciation and income generation. Automatic Reinvestment of Staking Rewards: A key feature of SOLQ is its automatic reinvestment of staking rewards. This compounding effect can potentially enhance returns over time, maximizing the benefits of Solana staking for investors. Custodial Solution: 3iQ, as the ETF provider, handles the complexities of staking and custody of the underlying Solana tokens, relieving investors of these responsibilities and associated risks. What are the Benefits of Investing in a Crypto Staking ETF like SOLQ? The emergence of Crypto ETFs focused on staking, like SOLQ, offers a range of advantages for investors, particularly those looking to gain exposure to the burgeoning world of decentralized finance (DeFi) and proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains: Benefit Description Simplified Access to Staking ETFs remove the technical barriers associated with direct staking, making it accessible to a wider range of investors. Liquidity and Tradability ETFs trade on exchanges, providing daily liquidity and the ability to buy or sell shares easily. Diversification Investing in a Staking ETF can diversify a portfolio by adding exposure to a specific blockchain ecosystem and its staking rewards. Professional Management ETF providers handle custody, staking operations, and regulatory compliance, offering professional management and reducing operational risks for investors. Regulatory Compliance ETFs operate within regulated frameworks, providing a level of investor protection and transparency that may be lacking in direct crypto investments. Challenges and Considerations with Solana and Crypto ETFs While the addition of a Solana Staking ETF to ARK Invest’s funds is undoubtedly positive news, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and considerations associated with both Solana and Crypto ETFs in general: Volatility of Solana and Crypto Markets: The cryptocurrency market, including Solana, is known for its volatility. Investments in SOLQ will be subject to these price fluctuations. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and Crypto ETFs is still evolving. Changes in regulations could impact the operation and performance of these products. Smart Contract Risks: Solana, like other blockchains, relies on smart contracts. While Solana aims for high security, smart contract vulnerabilities can pose risks to the underlying network and staked assets. ETF Management Fees: Crypto ETFs typically come with management fees, which investors need to consider as they can impact overall returns. Staking Risks: While staking offers rewards, there are inherent risks such as slashing (penalties for validator misbehavior) and potential lock-up periods for staked tokens. Actionable Insights for Investors: Is a Solana Staking ETF Right for You? ARK Invest’s move into Solana Staking ETF space prompts a crucial question: Is this type of investment suitable for your portfolio? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Crypto ETFs , especially those focused on specific blockchains like Solana, are inherently more volatile than traditional ETFs. Ensure your risk tolerance aligns with the potential price swings. Understand Solana’s Fundamentals: Before investing, research Solana’s technology, use cases, and ecosystem. A strong understanding of the underlying asset is crucial. Consider Your Investment Horizon: Crypto ETFs , particularly in emerging spaces like staking, are generally considered long-term investments. Be prepared to hold for an extended period to potentially realize significant returns. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A Solana Staking ETF should be part of a diversified investment strategy, not the sole holding. Stay Informed: The crypto space is rapidly evolving. Stay updated on developments in Solana, Crypto ETFs , and regulatory changes to make informed investment decisions. Conclusion: A Promising Step for Solana and Crypto ETF Evolution ARK Invest’s inclusion of the 3iQ Solana Staking ETF in ARKW and ARKF marks a significant milestone for both Solana and the broader Crypto ETF market. It signifies growing institutional acceptance of staked cryptocurrencies as legitimate investment vehicles and opens up new avenues for investors to participate in the growth of innovative blockchain ecosystems like Solana. While challenges and risks remain, this move underscores the transformative potential of digital assets and the ongoing evolution of the financial landscape. As Institutional Investment in crypto continues to mature, we can expect to see more sophisticated and diverse products like Solana Staking ETFs entering the market, further bridging the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized world.

43646538,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=151277,1745286036,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Insightful Analysis: Altcoin ETFs Expected to Have Limited Market Impact Amidst Crypto ETF Frenzy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/altcoin-etfs-limited-market-impact/,"The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with anticipation for new exchange-traded funds (ETFs), especially those focused on altcoins. However, not everyone is convinced that these new investment vehicles will revolutionize the crypto landscape. Eric Balchunas, a respected ETF analyst at Bloomberg, recently shared his perspective, suggesting that the excitement surrounding altcoin ETFs might be overblown. Let’s dive into his analysis and understand why he believes the market impact of these upcoming products could be more modest than many expect. Why Bitcoin ETF Dominance Matters for Crypto ETF Market Impact To truly grasp Balchunas’s viewpoint, it’s essential to understand the current state of the cryptocurrency fund market. According to his analysis, a staggering 90% of global cryptocurrency fund assets are currently invested in Bitcoin ETFs . This is a crucial statistic that highlights Bitcoin’s overwhelming dominance in the crypto investment space. Think about it – when investors think of crypto ETFs right now, Bitcoin is the first, and often only, name that comes to mind. This established dominance creates a significant hurdle for any new crypto ETFs , especially those focusing on altcoins. It’s like trying to launch a new streaming service when Netflix and Disney+ already control the lion’s share of the market. Breaking through that existing stronghold is a considerable challenge. The Altcoin ETF Wave: A Drop in the Ocean? Despite the Bitcoin-centric landscape, the crypto industry is eagerly awaiting a wave of altcoin ETFs . Ethereum ETFs are widely expected to be next in line, with speculation around ETFs for other popular altcoins and even memecoins growing. Balchunas acknowledges this impending influx of new products, but tempers expectations regarding their overall ETF market impact . He argues that while these altcoin ETFs will undoubtedly attract some investment, their collective impact on the broader crypto market might be limited. Here’s why: Bitcoin’s First-Mover Advantage: Bitcoin ETFs have been available for a longer time and have already captured the attention of institutional and retail investors seeking crypto exposure. This first-mover advantage is hard to overcome. Investor Familiarity and Trust: Bitcoin is the most well-known and established cryptocurrency. Many investors are more comfortable investing in Bitcoin compared to lesser-known altcoins, leading to a natural preference for Bitcoin ETFs. Market Capitalization Differences: Bitcoin’s market capitalization dwarfs that of most altcoins. This means that even if an altcoin ETF is successful, its overall asset size and market influence will likely be smaller compared to Bitcoin ETFs. Regulatory Hurdles: While the regulatory environment for crypto is evolving, altcoins often face greater regulatory scrutiny than Bitcoin. This could impact the approval process and investor perception of altcoin ETFs . Understanding the Potential Benefits of Altcoin ETFs While Balchunas’s analysis suggests a limited ETF market impact , it’s important to recognize that altcoin ETFs still offer several potential benefits to the crypto ecosystem and investors: Increased Accessibility: Altcoin ETFs can make investing in altcoins more accessible to retail investors who may find it complicated or risky to buy and store altcoins directly. Diversification Opportunities: For investors already exposed to Bitcoin, altcoin ETFs provide a way to diversify their crypto portfolio and potentially capture gains from the altcoin market. Mainstream Adoption: The introduction of altcoin ETFs further legitimizes the cryptocurrency market and can contribute to broader mainstream adoption of digital assets. Potential for Growth: While starting from a smaller base, successful altcoin ETFs can attract significant capital over time, especially if the underlying altcoins experience substantial growth. Navigating the Crypto ETF Landscape: Key Takeaways So, what are the key takeaways from Balchunas’s analysis and the broader discussion around crypto ETFs and their market impact ? Manage Expectations: Don’t expect altcoin ETFs to replicate the explosive growth seen by Bitcoin ETFs immediately. Their impact is likely to be more gradual and potentially less dramatic. Bitcoin ETFs Remain King: Bitcoin ETFs will likely continue to dominate the cryptocurrency funds market for the foreseeable future. Bitcoin remains the primary entry point for many institutional and retail investors into crypto. Focus on Fundamentals: When considering investing in altcoin ETFs , focus on the fundamentals of the underlying altcoins. Understand their technology, use cases, and long-term potential. Diversification Strategy: Use altcoin ETFs as a tool for diversification within your broader crypto investment strategy, rather than expecting them to be the primary drivers of portfolio growth. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors For crypto investors, Balchunas’s analysis offers valuable perspective. It’s a reminder that while the crypto market is dynamic and full of potential, it’s crucial to approach new investment products with realistic expectations. Here are some actionable insights: Conduct Thorough Research: Before investing in any crypto ETF , especially altcoin ETFs , do your homework. Understand the underlying assets, the ETF’s structure, and associated risks. Consider Portfolio Allocation: Think carefully about how altcoin ETFs fit into your overall investment portfolio. Don’t over-allocate to these potentially riskier assets. Stay Informed: The crypto market is constantly evolving. Stay updated on regulatory developments, market trends, and expert analysis to make informed investment decisions. Long-Term Perspective: Crypto investments, including ETFs, are generally considered long-term plays. Avoid short-term speculation and focus on the long-term growth potential of the asset class. Conclusion: A Measured Approach to Altcoin ETF Excitement Eric Balchunas’s analysis provides a valuable counterpoint to the widespread enthusiasm surrounding upcoming altcoin ETFs . While these products offer new opportunities for investors and can contribute to the growth of the crypto market, it’s important to maintain a balanced perspective. The dominance of Bitcoin ETFs and various market factors suggest that the market impact of altcoin ETFs may be more limited than some anticipate. By understanding these nuances and adopting a measured approach, investors can navigate the evolving crypto ETF landscape more effectively and make informed decisions aligned with their investment goals.

Analysts Are Watching!,https://thecoinrise.com/could-magacoinfinance-outperform-bitcoin-and-xrp-analysts-are-watching/,"Bitcoin (BTC) and Ripple (XRP) continue to command the spotlight in the crypto world, serving as foundational assets for retail and institutional investors alike. But as we move deeper into the 2025 cycle, traders are beginning to shift their focus toward coins with more room for explosive growth. With projects like Uniswap (UNI) and Polkadot (DOT) struggling to break new ground, one new name is stealing attention: MAGACOINFINANCE . GET 50% EXTRA BONUS – USE CODE MAGA50X – LIMITED TIME OFFER Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Becoming the #1 Choice in 2025 MAGACOINFINANCE attracted heavy investor interest almost instantly — a clear sign of early momentum and confidence. As one of the newest altcoin entries this year, its rise has been swift and steady. Traders and analysts alike are pointing to the project’s structure and timing as key advantages, with many labeling it a leading early-stage entry of this cycle. The combination of rapid interest, exclusivity, and projected upside has solidified MAGACOINFINANCE as a prime watchlist contender. It’s not just early—it’s aligned with what successful altcoins have looked like before breaking out. This time, smart buyers are getting in before the rest of the market catches up. How MAGACOINFINANCE Compares to the Competition Bitcoin (BTC): The market’s anchor, but too mature to offer breakout returns. XRP: Proven and regulated, though unlikely to deliver multi-multiplier upside in this cycle. Uniswap (UNI): A DeFi essential, but lagging in price movement. MAGACOINFINANCE breaks away from this crowd with strong entry-stage positioning, focused attention, and high-return modeling that analysts are now watching closely. GET 50% EXTRA BONUS – USE CODE MAGA50X – LIMITED TIME OFFER The Opportunity to Get in Early Is Now With legacy players like Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP stabilizing—and mid-cap coins like Uniswap (UNI) and Polkadot (DOT) showing limited movement— MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining momentum as the leading breakout prospect of 2025. This could be one of the last early entries with serious upside potential.

43646902,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=151278,1745286633,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Soaring ChatGPT Search Adoption: Europe Leads AI Growth, OpenAI Data Reveals",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/chatgpt-search-europe-ai-growth/,"The AI revolution is not just talk; it’s showing up in numbers, especially in Europe! Recent data from OpenAI reveals an astonishing surge in the adoption of ChatGPT search across the continent. This feature, which allows ChatGPT to tap into real-time web information, is rapidly becoming a go-to tool for users seeking up-to-date insights. Let’s dive into the details of this impressive growth and what it means for the future of AI search growth . Why is ChatGPT Search Adoption in Europe Seeing Such Rapid Growth? According to a report by OpenAI Ireland Limited, the European corporate division of OpenAI, ChatGPT search witnessed a dramatic increase in monthly active users. For the six-month period ending March 31, 2025, the average monthly active recipients hit a staggering 41.3 million. Compare this to the 11.2 million from the previous six-month period ending October 31, 2024, and you see a clear picture of explosive growth. This data, made public to comply with the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), highlights the increasing appetite for AI-powered search tools in Europe. Here’s a quick breakdown of the user growth: Period ending October 31, 2024: Approximately 11.2 million average monthly active recipients. Period ending March 31, 2025: Approximately 41.3 million average monthly active recipients. This substantial jump underscores the growing relevance of AI search growth in the European digital landscape. But what factors are driving this impressive expansion? Europe AI Adoption: A Fertile Ground for ChatGPT Search? Several factors could be contributing to the strong Europe AI adoption of ChatGPT search: Increased Awareness and Trust: As AI technology becomes more mainstream, users are increasingly aware of and trusting in tools like ChatGPT for information retrieval. Seamless Integration: The integration of search directly within ChatGPT provides a convenient and user-friendly experience, eliminating the need to switch between different platforms. Demand for Real-Time Information: Users are constantly seeking the most current information, and ChatGPT search effectively addresses this need by incorporating up-to-date web data. European Digital Landscape: Europe’s digitally savvy population and proactive approach to technology adoption create a favorable environment for AI innovation to flourish. This blend of user demand and technological advancement is likely fueling the impressive AI search growth observed in Europe. Navigating the Digital Services Act: OpenAI DSA Compliance and ChatGPT Search The Digital Services Act (DSA) plays a crucial role in shaping the online environment in Europe. For platforms like OpenAI, OpenAI DSA compliance is not just a regulatory requirement but also an opportunity to demonstrate transparency and build user trust. The DSA defines ‘monthly active recipients’ as individuals engaging with a service at least once a month by interacting with information on the platform’s interface. Key aspects of the DSA relevant to OpenAI DSA compliance and platforms like ChatGPT search include: Transparency Reporting: Platforms with a large user base are required to publish data on user engagement, content moderation, and risk assessments, as exemplified by OpenAI’s report. User Empowerment: The DSA mandates that very large online platforms (over 45 million monthly active recipients) provide users with options to opt out of recommendation systems and profiling. Accountability and Auditing: These platforms must also share data with researchers and authorities and undergo external audits to ensure compliance. As ChatGPT search continues its growth trajectory, it may soon fall under the ‘very large online platform’ category, necessitating adherence to these stricter DSA requirements. This evolving regulatory landscape is crucial for understanding the future development and deployment of AI search technologies in Europe. ChatGPT Search vs. Traditional Search Engines: Is Google Losing Ground? While AI search growth is undeniable, it’s important to maintain perspective when comparing ChatGPT search to established giants like Google. Although a September poll indicated that 8% of people would choose ChatGPT over Google as their primary search engine, Google still dominates the market, handling an estimated 373 times more searches than ChatGPT. Here’s a comparison table highlighting key differences: Feature ChatGPT Search Google Search Search Paradigm Conversational, AI-powered Keyword-based, Algorithmic Information Source Real-time web access integrated with AI model Vast index of web pages Accuracy & Reliability Still under development, accuracy can vary Generally high accuracy for factual queries Market Share Rapidly growing but still small compared to Google Dominant market share Research also suggests that ChatGPT search and similar AI-powered search engines can be less reliable than traditional search for certain types of queries. Studies have pointed out accuracy issues, including incorrect identification of articles and problems with handling news content. However, the rapid pace of AI development means these limitations are likely to be addressed and improved over time. The Future of AI Search Growth in Europe: What to Expect? The AI search growth in Europe, spearheaded by platforms like ChatGPT search, signals a significant shift in how people access and interact with online information. While Google remains the search behemoth, the rise of AI-driven search tools presents both opportunities and challenges. Looking ahead, we can anticipate: Continued Innovation: Expect further advancements in AI search accuracy, reliability, and features, making it even more competitive with traditional search. Evolving User Behavior: As users become more comfortable with conversational AI, we may see a gradual shift in search habits and preferences. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased regulatory attention, particularly in the context of the DSA, will shape the operational landscape for AI search providers in Europe. Integration and Hybrid Models: Future search engines may increasingly incorporate AI elements, leading to hybrid models that blend the strengths of both traditional and AI-powered search. The soaring adoption of ChatGPT search in Europe is a clear indicator that AI search growth is not just a trend, but a transformative force reshaping the digital world. As this technology matures and user adoption expands, it will be fascinating to witness its continued impact on the search landscape and beyond.

Atkins was an early adviser for the stablecoin firm around the time it launched in 2019, according to Reserve Protocol’s CEO Nevin Freeman. He is no longer consulting at the firm. The Reserve Rights ( RSR ) token is the governance token aimed at ensuring the stability of the Reserve Protocol’s stablecoin, Reserve Dollar (RSV). In an April 21 X post, Coinbase said it would list the RSR token on the Ethereum layer-2 network Base on April 22 at 9 am Pacific Time (4 pm UTC). Source: Coinbase Assets Atkins news bumps up RSR’s price even further The Coinbase listing, combined with the news of Atkins officially being sworn in as SEC chair on April 21, pushed the token up 13.6% to a near two-month high of $0.00835 on April 22, CoinGecko data shows. Prior to Atkins being sworn in, RSR had already risen double digits to around $0.0081. It is currently the 143rd largest coin by market capitalization at $464 million. Atkins said he will be focused on ensuring the US is the “best and most secure place in the world to invest and do business,” while ensuring sufficient consumer protection measures are in place. It comes two weeks after the Senate confirmed Atkins as SEC chair in a 52-44 vote on April 9. Related: Crypto in a bear market, rebound likely in Q3 — Coinbase Atkins takes over from Mark Uyeda, who has been the SEC’s acting chair since Jan. 20, when former chair Gary Gensler stepped down. Since US President Donald Trump returned to office, the SEC created a Crypto Task Force to consult with the industry on regulation and dropped several crypto-related investigations and enforcement actions undertaken by the Gensler-led SEC. Atkins is expected to take a more crypto-friendly approach, telling a Senate confirmation hearing in March that a priority of his at the SEC would be to provide a firm regulatory foundation for crypto assets through a “rational, coherent and principled approach.” Magazine: Memecoin degeneracy is funding groundbreaking anti-aging research",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-22 01:53:41

Major caps are stabilizing, smart capital is shifting, and traders are scouting for high-upside entries. Right now, three tokens are standing out in the conversation : XRP, Apto s, and MAGACOIN FINANCE . Each is operating in a different phase of visibility, but only one is still in its earliest stage of market discovery. XRP: Back in the Spotlight, but with Limited Runway XRP continues to benefit from institutional momentum. After a long legal battle, the project is now on stronger footing. Recent developments—including an Asia-based tracker fund and growing ETF speculation—have helped XRP regain investor confidence. It’s trading in a relatively strong range, with more eyes returning to it as regulatory clarity builds. However, while XRP is trending positively, the ceiling is defined. Traders entering now may still benefit, but the upside is likely incremental rather than exponential. It’s a strong foundation play, not a fresh breakout. Aptos: Technically Solid, but Price Is Flat Aptos, on the other hand, is widely viewed as one of the most structurally sound Layer-1 projects in the space. Its developer base remains active, on-chain metrics are solid, and it continues to attract builders. That said, price action has been neutral. While Aptos remains one of the more technically impressive ecosystems, it hasn’t delivered the kind of recent performance that excites short-term traders. It’s a steady asset with long-term strength—but lacks the near-term spark many are searching for in Q2. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Structured Momentum Before Public Discovery Then there’s MAGACOIN FINANCE. Unlike XRP or Aptos, this project is not yet listed on any public exchanges. It is in its earliest growth phase—quietly building market traction as its initial allocation phases fill out. What’s grabbing the attention of analysts and early adopters alike is the structure behind it. There are no insider discounts, no early investor unlock schedules, and no hidden token movements. Each round has been moving based on real buyer engagement, giving this launch a uniquely transparent progression. A Clean Model That’s Gaining Real Traction What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE so compelling isn’t just its stage—it’s how it’s managing that stage. Instead of launching with vague roadmap promises or meme hype, the project is unfolding in real time with a locked-in listing model and clear capital flow. Traders aren’t chasing trends—they’re stepping into an early model that hasn’t been priced in yet by the broader market. It’s the kind of asymmetric positioning that typically disappears the moment a token hits the chart. Momentum is building organically and without artificial rush. The project is currently expanding across social platforms and direct buyer networks, with growing attention from retail and early strategic players alike. Every phase completed so far has happened on merit—not marketing. The Advantage of Getting In Before the Shift What stands out about MAGACOIN FINANCE is how early it still is. While other tokens have already experienced major runs and are now stabilizing, this is a project that hasn’t had its first candle. That matters. Traders who look for structure over speculation are finding this setup increasingly difficult to ignore. In any market cycle, timing makes the difference. XRP and Aptos both offer credibility and history, but they’re already in motion. MAGACOIN FINANCE is still forming. It’s still being built, layer by layer, with a listing target already confirmed and a clear path toward its market debut. That moment—when a token moves from under-the-radar to publicly traded—is when everything changes. The entry, the advantage, the leverage all shift. And right now, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains before that moment. That’s where the opportunity lives. Final Thoughts: This Setup Doesn’t Last Forever Investors aren’t just looking at what this project is today. They’re looking at what it could represent 12 months from now. And from all signals so far, this is shaping up to be one of the most strategically positioned entries of the 2025 cycle. For traders looking beyond the noise—those seeking structure, upside, and early access without insider risk—MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the clearest answer.

Aptos crypto is clinging to key support levels, raising questions about whether recent developer upgrades will be enough to trigger a bounce. At the same time, Near Protocol price prediction is stirring debate, with traders unsure if NEAR is set to rally or retreat. Then there’s BlockDAG (BDAG) , stepping confidently into its next phase. With exchange listings on the horizon and a presale already delivering a 2,380% gain, it’s becoming a top choice for nyone searching for the highest ROI crypto right now. Aptos Crypto Holds Support, Eyes Recovery on Dev Activity Aptos (APT) crypto is hanging around the $4.63–$4.74 range this week, staying firm despite a cautious broader market. Resistance near $4.85 still looms, but some analysts believe the recent correction phase might be wrapping up. That’s putting APT back on the radar for traders looking for signs of a turnaround. Behind the scenes, Aptos developers continue building. Tools like Dynamic Script Composer and upgrades in Account Abstraction are making the Move programming language more efficient. These changes aim to streamline DeFi activity and reduce gas costs. APT crypto hasn’t broken out yet, but steady improvements in its ecosystem are helping it stay relevant, even in a quiet market. Near Protocol Price Prediction Triggers Mixed Sentiment Traders watching Near Protocol are getting mixed signals. Some believe the chart points to a bounce toward $3.50, while others argue that NEAR could slide all the way to $0.75 by the end of 2025. Technical indicators like a descending wedge and a bullish MACD crossover suggest upside potential. But falling user activity and a sharp drop from March highs have added to the uncertainty. NEAR saw user numbers surge tenfold in 2023, but total value locked remains low compared to rivals. That’s why the Near Protocol price prediction has the market divided, it all comes down to whether the wedge breaks upward or collapses. BlockDAG’s Exchange Listings Could Be a Game-Changer BlockDAG is gearing up for its biggest leap yet. CEO Antony Turner confirmed in a recent AMA that BDAG will list on around 10 centralized exchanges shortly after the Token Generation Event (TGE). One of them might even be a tier-one exchange, which could dramatically increase exposure and volume. Once BDAG is live on exchanges, many expect tighter spreads, higher liquidity, and wider access via fiat onramps. With batch 27 pricing BDAG at just $0.0248, early buyers, who picked up 19.3 billion tokens, have already seen a 2,380% return. Listings will roll out after mining launches and vesting schedules begin. Until then, supply remains limited. For those still hunting for the highest ROI crypto before listings go live, this could be the final buying window. Certik and Halborn have both cleared BlockDAG in recent audits. Meanwhile, its hybrid setup, combining DAG architecture with Proof-of-Work, continues to attract developer and buyer attention. Many believe once BDAG hits a major exchange, prices under a few cents may be gone for good. What Traders Are Watching Next Aptos crypto is holding its ground, and the Near Protocol price prediction remains a topic of debate. But while both projects keep people guessing, BlockDAG is showing clear signs of progress. With 10 confirmed exchange listings, $215.5 million raised, and a presale price that still offers room for growth, BDAG is making a compelling case. For anyone focused on the highest ROI crypto opportunities, BlockDAG’s next phase could be the one to watch.

43647183,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=151281,1745287229,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Strategic Crypto Shift: Ark Invest Buys Robinhood & Solana ETF, Trims Bitcoin ETF Holdings",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ark-invest-crypto-portfolio-shift/,"In a fascinating turn of events in the crypto investment landscape, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest has once again made headlines with significant portfolio adjustments. Known for her bold and often contrarian investment strategies, Wood’s recent moves signal a notable shift in focus within the digital asset space. Let’s dive into the details of Ark Invest’s latest transactions and explore what they might signify for the future of crypto investments, particularly concerning Bitcoin ETF , Solana ETF , and stocks like Robinhood . Why is Ark Invest Doubling Down on Robinhood? Ark Invest, under the leadership of Cathie Wood, has increased its stake in Robinhood , a popular brokerage app known for its accessibility to retail investors and its foray into cryptocurrency trading. According to a recent report by Wu Blockchain on X, Ark Invest, through its ARKK Innovation ETF, purchased a substantial 60,266 shares of Robinhood . This acquisition, valued at approximately $2.45 million, underscores Ark Invest’s continued confidence in Robinhood ‘s long-term growth potential. But what makes Robinhood so appealing to Ark Invest? Exposure to Retail Investment Boom: Robinhood is strategically positioned to benefit from the ongoing surge in retail investing, especially among younger demographics. As more individuals enter the market seeking opportunities in stocks and cryptocurrencies, platforms like Robinhood stand to gain significantly. Cryptocurrency Integration: Robinhood has embraced cryptocurrencies, offering users a platform to trade various digital assets. This integration aligns with Ark Invest’s bullish stance on the future of cryptocurrencies and their increasing adoption. Innovation and Disruption: Ark Invest’s investment philosophy centers around disruptive innovation. Robinhood , with its commission-free trading model and user-friendly interface, embodies this disruptive spirit within the financial services industry. What’s the Strategic Play with Solana ETF? In another noteworthy move, Ark Invest expanded its cryptocurrency ETF holdings by acquiring 500,000 shares of the 3iQ Solana ETF (SOLQ.U). This purchase, conducted jointly through ARKF (Fintech Innovation ETF) and ARKW (Next Generation Internet ETF), is valued at approximately $5.2 million. This investment signals a strong vote of confidence in Solana and its ecosystem. Why is Ark Invest betting big on a Solana ETF ? Solana’s Technological Advantages: Solana is known for its high transaction speeds and low fees, addressing some of the scalability challenges faced by other blockchain networks. These technological advantages position Solana as a strong contender in the blockchain space. Growing Solana Ecosystem: The Solana ecosystem is rapidly expanding, with a vibrant community of developers and a growing number of decentralized applications (dApps) being built on the network. This growth indicates a healthy and promising future for Solana. Diversification within Crypto Portfolio: Investing in a Solana ETF allows Ark Invest to diversify its cryptocurrency exposure beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, tapping into the potential of alternative layer-1 blockchains. Why Sell Bitcoin ETF Shares Now? Interestingly, amidst these acquisitions, Ark Invest decided to reduce its holdings in the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB). ARKW sold 31,817 shares, worth approximately $2.7 million. This sale might seem contradictory given Ark Invest’s generally bullish stance on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. So, why would Ark Invest sell shares of a Bitcoin ETF while simultaneously investing in other crypto assets? Portfolio Rebalancing: Investment firms like Ark Invest regularly rebalance their portfolios to maintain their desired asset allocation. Selling a portion of their Bitcoin ETF holdings could be a strategic move to rebalance the portfolio in light of gains or to allocate capital to other promising opportunities like Solana ETF and Robinhood . Profit Taking: Given the significant appreciation in Bitcoin’s price over the past year, Ark Invest might be taking profits from its Bitcoin ETF investment. This is a common practice in portfolio management to capitalize on gains and manage risk. Strategic Shift Towards Altcoins: The move could also indicate a strategic shift towards altcoins like Solana, reflecting a belief in their higher growth potential compared to Bitcoin in the current market cycle. While Bitcoin ETF remains a core holding, allocating more to Solana ETF suggests a pursuit of higher alpha. Investment Action Shares Value (Approx.)

This diversification strategy reflects a maturing crypto market with expanding investment opportunities.

Around 13 million coins were moved from OKX exchange to other wallets. As per market observers, this relocation of coins from exchanges usually reflects investor plans for holding instead of selling in the short term. Reducing exchange supply usually puts upward pressure on prices if demand is firm. Technical Structure Needs Confirmation Before Next Move Other analysts presented a more cautious perspective, explaining that Pi Network must re-establish a “symmetrical triangle” pattern on higher timeframe charts before further upward momentum.

Mantra announced on April 21 that the unstaking process had begun, and would be completed by April 29, at which point Mullin's Mantra ( OM) tokens will be sent to the burn address and permanently removed from circulating supply. Source: John Patrick Mullin Mullin said it was a “first step in rebuilding trust with the community, but far from the last.” Mantra said it was also in talks with “key ecosystem partners” about burning a further 150 million OM to bring the total burn amount to 300 million. With 150 million fewer OM, Mantra’s total supply will decline to 1.67 billion, and its number of staked tokens will drop by over 26% from 571.8 million OM to 421.8 million OM. Returns will also be boosted: “This strategic burn will lower the bonded ratio from 31.47% to 25.30%, resulting in an increase in staking APR,” Mantra said. Token burn initiative follows OM price collapse Two days after Mantra’s rapid 90% price collapse on April 13, Mullins posted to X that he intended to burn all of the staked tokens he was allocated at the blockchain’s mainnet genesis in October. These vested “team tokens” were due to be unlocked starting in 2027. He also ran a poll on X about the proposed burn of his tokens, with alternate options such as extended vesting or unlocking tokens at milestones — as a “temperature check of people’s thoughts.” The poll had attracted almost 9,000 votes at the time of writing, and a number of commenters criticized it as an attempt to reverse course on the burn commitment. Source: John Patrick Mullin The burn is connected to an “OM Token support plan” Mantra announced following the price crash, which will also feature a token buyback. Mullin said the buyback program was also “well underway.” Related: How Mantra’s OM token collapsed in 24 hours of chaos Mantra also released a tokenomics dashboard to increase transparency as it seeks to regain the trust of the community. At the time of writing, the OM price remains down around 90% from its value of $6.30 earlier in April, trading at below $0.55.

Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Meteora is now at the center of a storm, grappling with a significant Meteora lawsuit . Investors have filed a class action lawsuit, sending shockwaves through the Solana ecosystem and raising critical questions about token launches and investor protection in the DeFi realm. Let’s delve into the specifics of this developing situation and understand what it means for the future of decentralized exchanges and cryptocurrency investments. What Sparked the Meteora Lawsuit? Allegations of M3M3 Token Misrepresentation At the heart of this legal battle is the launch of the M3M3 token on the Meteora platform in December of last year. According to the lawsuit, investors claim that Meteora engaged in “intentional misrepresentation” regarding crucial information surrounding the M3M3 token launch. This alleged misrepresentation, as per the lawsuit, directly led to the manipulation of the M3M3 token’s market price, causing financial harm to investors. To break it down simply, the investors are essentially accusing Meteora of not being upfront and honest about key details of the M3M3 token project right from the start. This lack of transparency, they argue, wasn’t just an oversight; it was a deliberate act that artificially inflated the token’s value initially, only for it to plummet later, leaving investors with losses. This forms the core of the crypto lawsuit against the Solana DEX. Diving Deeper: Understanding the M3M3 Token Controversy While the lawsuit documents are still unfolding, the core accusation revolves around misinformation related to the M3M3 token launch. Here’s what we can gather so far: Alleged Misleading Information: Investors claim that Meteora presented inaccurate or incomplete information about the M3M3 token, potentially regarding its tokenomics, intended use cases, or development roadmap. Market Price Manipulation: The lawsuit suggests that this misrepresentation was intended to artificially inflate the initial price of the M3M3 token. This tactic, often referred to as “pump and dump” in traditional markets, is a serious concern in the relatively unregulated crypto space. Investor Losses: As the token price potentially corrected or crashed after the initial hype, investors who bought M3M3 tokens based on the allegedly misrepresented information faced significant financial losses. It’s important to note that these are allegations at this stage. Meteora has yet to officially respond to the lawsuit, and the legal process will involve investigations and evidence presentation from both sides. However, the severity of these claims cannot be ignored, especially in the context of investor trust in DeFi platforms. The Broader Implications of the Decentralized Exchange Lawsuit This decentralized exchange lawsuit against Meteora is more than just an isolated incident. It highlights several critical issues within the DeFi sector: Investor Protection in DeFi: The case underscores the ongoing debate about investor protection in the decentralized finance space. Unlike traditional financial markets, DeFi platforms often operate with less regulatory oversight. This lawsuit could potentially set a precedent for how legal frameworks apply to DeFi projects and their responsibilities towards investors. Transparency and Disclosure: The allegations of misrepresentation emphasize the critical need for transparency and full disclosure from DeFi projects, especially during token launches. Investors need access to accurate and comprehensive information to make informed decisions. Due Diligence in Crypto Investments: While platforms have a responsibility to be transparent, investors also need to exercise due diligence. This lawsuit serves as a stark reminder of the risks involved in cryptocurrency investments, particularly in new and emerging projects. Regulatory Scrutiny on Solana DEXs: Given that Meteora is a Solana DEX , this lawsuit might attract increased regulatory scrutiny towards decentralized exchanges operating on the Solana blockchain. Regulators worldwide are increasingly focusing on the DeFi sector, and cases like this can accelerate the push for clearer guidelines and regulations. Navigating the DeFi Landscape: Actionable Insights for Investors In the wake of the Meteora lawsuit , what can crypto investors learn and how can they navigate the DeFi landscape more cautiously? Thorough Research is Paramount: Before investing in any crypto project, especially new tokens launched on DEXs, conduct in-depth research. Understand the project’s fundamentals, tokenomics, team, and roadmap. Don’t rely solely on hype or marketing materials. Assess Risk Tolerance: DeFi investments are inherently risky. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Understand your risk tolerance and diversify your portfolio across different asset classes. Evaluate Platform Transparency: When using a DEX, assess its transparency and community reputation. Look for platforms that prioritize clear communication and provide comprehensive information about listed projects. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with developments in the DeFi space, including regulatory changes and legal precedents. Follow reputable news sources and community discussions to stay informed about potential risks and opportunities. Seek Professional Advice: If you are unsure about DeFi investments, consider seeking advice from a qualified financial advisor who understands the cryptocurrency market. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for DeFi? The Meteora lawsuit serves as a potent reminder of the growing pains within the rapidly evolving DeFi sector. While decentralization offers numerous benefits, it also presents challenges related to accountability and investor protection. This case could be a watershed moment, potentially influencing how DeFi platforms operate, how token launches are conducted, and how regulatory bodies approach this innovative yet still nascent industry. For investors, it reinforces the crucial need for vigilance, informed decision-making, and a realistic understanding of the risks and rewards in the world of decentralized finance.

Bitcoin’s bouncing, Ethereum’s back above $3K, and the altcoin race is officially on. Meme coins are going viral on TikTok, and AI tokens are flexing like it’s a tech Olympics. But here’s the deal—most of the big gains? They’re in the rearview for last cycle favorites. If you’re just tuning in now, the “easy wins” on OG coins might be long gone. That said, there’s a new wave coming, and the smart move is catching the next rocket before it launches. That’s exactly where Qubetics ($TICS) shines. While big names like Hedera had their moment, Qubetics is dropping something even bigger: a utility-packed platform solving real-deal problems across industries. Hedera: A Beast That Already Ran Its Race Remember Hedera? Man, it had a moment. Back in 2021, it was on fire. That gossip protocol and enterprise play had people hyped. HBAR surged when it landed big-name partnerships with Google, IBM, and Boeing. The tech behind it—fast, feeless, and energy-efficient—checked all the right boxes. Folks were piling in when it was trading under ten cents, dreaming about dollar-level flips. Problem was, by the time the masses caught on, HBAR was already halfway to the moon. Fast forward to 2025, and yeah, Hedera still exists. It’s still got its place. But let’s be real: the 10x window has likely closed. Price swings are now more about market cycles than that next-gen tech leap. Here’s the kicker—if you’d bought in 2020 or 2021, you’d be golden. But now? That golden ticket’s already been scanned. HBAR made its big move, and while it might ride waves, it’s not gonna deliver the same earth-shaking returns it once did. The hype is past-tense. And that’s why folks are now shifting eyes to the next Hedera-style explosion. Something that’s still flying under the radar but cooking up a storm. Qubetics fits that bill like a glove. Qubetics ($TICS): The Affordable Crypto Everyone’s Talking About Qubetics is like finding a diamond while everyone else is still digging for copper. It’s not just another altcoin—it’s laying down real infrastructure with tools folks actually wanna use. And right now, it’s still in presale, which means it’s crazy affordable. This is the window most people wish they had with HBAR back in the day. Right now, the crypto presale is in its 31st stage. Over 509 million $TICS tokens have already been scooped up by more than 25,000 holders, raising over $16.3 million. Price per token? Just $0.1902. If you blink, that number might double by next week. And it ain’t just hype. Analysts are running wild with predictions: $TICS at $1? That’s a 425% ROI. $TICS at $5? You’re talking 2527% ROI. $TICS at $15 after mainnet? You’re looking at a jaw-dropping 7783%. Sounds wild? Not when you dig into what Qubetics actually does. It brings interoperability to the table, like real-deal multi-chain movement. Say you’re a freelancer juggling payments across Ethereum, BNB, and Solana? Qubetics’ non-custodial wallet lets you bounce between chains without the usual headaches. If you’re a dev or startup? QubeQode—their integrated dev environment—makes building apps feel like dragging and dropping in Canva. And for businesses? Imagine a logistics company in Uzbekistan tracking payments and smart contracts across multiple chains without needing ten wallets and a spreadsheet nightmare. Qubetics is bridging the gap between crypto chaos and smooth functionality. This ain’t vaporware. It’s solving problems the last generation of coins just ignored. And that’s why folks are saying Qubetics isn’t just one of the Top Cryptos to Buy for 2025 —it might end up leading the pack. Why Qubetics Makes Sense for Literally Everyone What makes Qubetics hit different is how it tailors to real life. It’s not some abstract chain promising miracles. It’s got use cases you can actually imagine in your own world. A gig worker in LA gets paid in SOL, but her rent needs ETH? Qubetics wallet handles that without drama. A small business in Almaty tracks cross-border inventory with chain-agnostic contracts? Easy. A dev team in Tbilisi builds and launches a dApp in one weekend using QubeQode? Totally possible. That kind of utility isn’t just buzzwords. It’s what makes Qubetics the real MVP of 2025. And with the presale still live, it’s not too late to jump in. Once the mainnet launches, that entry point’s gone. Let’s be real—how often do you catch a project this loaded before it hits the big leagues? Missing Qubetics now might hurt just as bad as missing Hedera when it was pennies. Conclusion: Blink and You’ll Miss It Again Timing in crypto isn’t everything—it’s the only thing. If you’re still chasing coins that already did 100x, you’re running in circles. Qubetics is that rare gem that checks all the boxes and still has room to grow. Presale’s heating up, and once it ends, so does your chance at getting in under 20 cents. Nobody wants to be the one saying, “Dang, I coulda grabbed $TICS at $0.1902.” Don’t fumble this bag. Qubetics is already shaking things up, and 2025’s crypto headlines are probably gonna be filled with “wish I bought” stories. Don’t let yours be one of them. It’s one of the Top Cryptos to Buy for 2025 , and missing it twice would be brutal. If you’re hunting serious ROI, keep your eyes locked on Qubetics—because the Top Cryptos to Buy for 2025 are already making moves. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs Is Qubetics legit or just another hyped-up presale? Qubetics is building real tools with real-world use. Its dev environment, wallet, and interoperability features make it more than just hype—it’s functional, and people are using it. How much does $TICS cost right now? In stage 31 of the presale, $TICS is priced at $0.1902. That price won’t stay low for long, though. Can I still make big gains with Qubetics? Analysts are predicting 425% to over 7700% ROI depending on how far it climbs post-launch. That kind of upside is rare. What makes Qubetics different from other cryptos? It solves actual problems: chain clutter, developer headaches, business inefficiency. It’s practical, not just pretty. When does Qubetics’ mainnet launch? It’s expected soon after the final presale stages wrap up. That’s when $TICS could skyrocket, according to market analysts.

There is no minimum requirement for staking Solana, but the practical minimum is around 0.01 SOL. All you need to start staking Solana is a SOL-compatible wallet. Staking is considered one of the safer ways to participate in crypto ecosystems. Solana is a blockchain network known for its fast transaction speeds and extensive ecosystem of decentralized applications ( DApps ). It also combines the proof-of-stake (PoS) and proof-of-history (PoH) consensus mechanisms, allowing you to stake its native currency, SOL ( SOL ), to earn rewards. This Solana staking guide walks you through the Solana staking process and explains why staking could be a smart move, especially if you’ve been wondering how to earn passive income with SOL. What is Solana staking? Solana staking consists of locking SOL into a cryptocurrency wallet . The process rewards you in the following ways: Staking rewards: You earn rewards for staking SOL — a percentage based on how much you’ve staked, Solana’s current inflation rate (which fluctuates and is set to decrease every year), the total amount of SOL staked on the network, and how long you’ve been staking overall. Governance: Staking gives you a say in governance , allowing you to vote on proposals that shape the Solana network. This approach prioritizes those with the largest investments, assuming they’ll act in the network’s best interest. Network security: Staking increases security to create a stable investment environment. By staking, you’re directly contributing to Solana’s health and longevity. That said, if a few wallets stake large amounts, one could argue they’re centralizing the network. If you earn rewards staking SOL, they’re paid out every two days — a period known as an epoch. When staking SOL, you’re delegating funds to a Solana representative (a validator .) Validators process transactions, produce blocks, and vote on network proposals. It’s essential to choose a validator that aligns with your vision for Solana, as they’ll be voting in your stead, much like an elected official in traditional governments. Validator votes are stake-weighted. The more stake a validator has, the more weight their vote carries. Solana validator vs. delegator: By delegating funds to a validator, you become a delegator. The validator’s job is to vote in the network’s best interest. It’s your job to choose reputable validators that keep the network safe. Did you know? Solana is one of the fastest blockchains in terms of transactions per second (TPS). It currently averages around 1,128 TPS, with a theoretical max of 65,000 TPS. Staking Solana for beginners There are a few things to consider as you prepare to stake Solana. Understanding staking methods On the surface, staking is quite simple; however, there are actually two staking methods — each affects your SOL liquidity. Liquid staking: Earn rewards while retaining control of your SOL’s liquidity. When you liquid stake , you receive liquid staking tokens (LSTs) equivalent to the amount of SOL you stake. You can use those LSTs in Solana’s decentralized finance (DeFi) applications as you would if you weren’t staking funds. Native staking: Native staking is the original method that locks your funds away, allowing you to earn rewards and participate in governance. However, you cannot use your funds without pulling them out via the unstaking process. This process is beginner-friendly but limits what you can do with your SOL. The difference between the two is flexibility. Native staking is less flexible but easier for beginners, while liquid staking retains your liquidity for use in DeFi and other applications. Solana staking tax 2025 In the United States, Solana staking rewards are subject to income and capital gains tax . Income tax: You’re required to pay income tax on the value of SOL at the moment you unstake it. You also pay income tax on staking rewards when you gain the ability to withdraw them. Capital gains tax: You’re required to pay capital gains tax once you sell or convert that SOL. How to stake Solana Now, let’s get into the Solana staking tutorial. Choose a Solana wallet First, you need a wallet to store and stake your SOL. Most Solana wallets have built-in staking capabilities. This guide uses the Phantom Wallet for demonstration purposes. Download Phantom Wallet from its official website by clicking the “Download” button. Next, click “Create a new wallet.” You’ll be asked to continue with an email or a seed phrase wallet. Click “Create a seed phrase wallet.” Enter a password, and proceed to the recovery phrase screen. Write down your recovery seed phrase on piece of paper, check the confirmation box, and click “Continue.” Create a username, click “Continue,” and you’ll have created a Solana wallet. Fund the wallet Fund Phantom with SOL by either transferring SOL from another wallet or buying it with a debit/credit card via the “Buy” button. Phantom partners with companies such as Robinhood or Topper to facilitate card payments, allowing you to buy from within the wallet interface. After funding your wallet, it’s time to start staking. Stake your Solana Open your token list and click on “Solana.” Select “Start earning SOL.” Now, choose between “Liquid Staking” or “Native Staking.” Liquid staking is typically done via a third-party provider. Phantom integrates with Jito’s liquid staking platform, enabling you to receive JitoSOL LSTs when you liquid stake. If you choose to liquid stake, Phantom will detail your estimated annual percentage yield (APY) and how much JitoSOL you’ll receive in return for staking. JitoSOL will appear in your token list. JitoSOL will appear in your token list. If you choose native staking, you must commit to a validator. Phantom will list validators in order of how much SOL is staked to them and their estimated APY. Select a validator, enter how much SOL you’d like to stake, and click “Stake.” The network will create your staking account, and you’ll start earning rewards in a few days. Congratulations, you’re successfully staking SOL. Did you know? Validators who act out of turn or experience significant downtime will have their rewards slashed, also reducing the rewards of those who stake with the validator. How to unstake Solana Whether you choose liquid or native staking, here’s how to unstake your funds. You might unstake if: You want to convert SOL: If you want to swap or sell your SOL, you must unstake the funds first. You want to stake elsewhere: If another network catches your eye, you’ll have to unstake your Solana funds to transfer them for staking on another network. Validators act up: If your validator acts outside the network’s best interest, you may want to unstake and delegate to another validator. Unstake natively staked tokens To unstake natively staked tokens, click on “Solana” in your token list. Next, click on “Your stake.” Select the validator you want to unstake from and click “Unstake.” Then, select “Withdraw Stake” to pull the funds back into your wallet. The validator will show “Inactive” once you’ve unstaked. Unstake LSTs To unstake your LSTs, select them in your token list. Click “More” in the options list, then select “Unstake.” If you’re using Jito as your LST provider, clicking unstake will take you to Jito’s platform. Here, you have two options: unstake immediately or delayed unstaking. Unstake immediately: Immediate unstaking costs a small fee, based on the amount you are unstaking. You can pay additional fees to prioritize your transaction or tip validators. Finally, you can adjust your slippage tolerance. Delayed unstaking: Delayed unstaking can range from one day to a week, depending on network congestion, but you pay a much lower fee. You also don’t have to account for slippage , as the network won’t prioritize your transaction. Choose whichever option works best for you, and click “Unstake SOL.” The funds will appear in your wallet. Did you know? You can stake Solana with as little as 0.01 SOL, making it one of the most accessible PoS blockchain networks. Is Solana wallet staking safe? Staking Solana is relatively safe, but even if you know how Solana staking works, there are risks to be aware of: Market volatility: Solana is subject to market volatility as much as any other cryptocurrency. The value of your staked SOL can fluctuate based on market conditions. Validator behavior: Validators can act out of favor with the network and may experience “slashing.” Slashing penalizes the validator’s rewards, which affects your rewards as well. Your initial investment remains safe, however. Cyberthreats: Blockchain networks are exposed to bad actors 24/7, meaning they can be vulnerable to hacks at any time, putting your funds at risk. Past downtime: Solana has had various outages over the years, often due to congestion. While this doesn’t necessarily mean your funds are at risk, bad actors could target the network during its weak moments. So, while staking on Solana offers potential rewards, it’s important to understand that staking always carries risk. As with any investment, there’s a possibility of loss, so it’s crucial to evaluate your risk tolerance and take necessary precautions.

If Singapore’s High Court gives the nod, WazirX parent company Zettai PTE Ltd can restart the exchange and begin its compensation scheme for affected users within 10 business days, WazirX said in an April 21 update to X. WazirX lost $234 million of crypto from a Safe Multisig wallet mid-July 2024 in an attack since attributed to North Korean hackers , forcing them to temporarily pause all crypto and Indian rupee withdrawals on the platform. Source: WazirX “Zettai has completed all prior required steps, and the next key step is the sanction hearing, which the Singapore High Court has scheduled for May 13, 2025,” the firm said. “This hearing is essential for the Scheme to become legally effective. While we’ve worked to stay aligned with the previously shared timelines, court proceedings operate independently, and we respect that process.” On April 7, more than 90% of the voting creditors voted in favor of the platform’s post-hack restructuring plan, which involved the issuance of recovery tokens. The tokens would be repurchased using net profits from the exchange and could yield 75% to 80% of users’ account balances at the time of the cyberattack. WazirX had warned that repayments from the $235 million hack could be delayed until 2030 if creditors didn’t approve its proposed restructuring plan. Singapore’s High Court gave Zettai permission to convene a creditors’ meeting to propose a possible remedy for users and a plan to get the exchange back online in January.

Petitioners also asked the court to audit WazirX’s accounts. Justices B.R.

The Fair Taxation of Digital Assets in Puerto Rico Act of 2025 was introduced by Representative Nydia Velázquez of New York. The measure aims to fill a loophole allowing crypto investors to pay no federal taxes by moving to the island. Currently, residents of Puerto Rico who are considered bona fide residents of the island can pay little or no local or federal taxes on their capital gains, including profits earned from cryptocurrency trading, under Act 60. This policy has drawn thousands of wealthy investors over the past decade. The proposed law would add a provision to the Internal Revenue Code requiring that digital asset income earned by Puerto Rico residents be taxed under the same federal rules as income earned on the U.S. mainland. Lawmakers blame crypto investors for inflating living costs The influx of crypto-investors has reportedly done more damage than good to the local Puerto Rico population, according to Velázquez and other lawmakers. Instead of strengthening the economy, they say, an influx of rich crypto traders has inflated living costs, particularly in property markets. “This wave of crypto investors hasn’t helped Puerto Rico’s recovery or strengthened the local economy,” Velazquez said. According to her, it has only driven up housing costs, pushed out local residents, and added pressure to an island where nearly 40% of people live in poverty — all while costing the federal government billions in lost tax revenue. The Joint Committee on Taxation said that the tax breaks for investors will cause the federal government to lose an estimated $4.5 billion in revenue between 2020 and 2026. The economic divide is becoming more apparent in cities such as San Juan, where the signs of luxury real estate developments have multiplied even as many local families cope with high rents and limited options for work. Earlier this month, Puerto Rico’s new governor, Jenniffer González, proposed slightly tightening Act 60. Her proposal would keep the benefits in place until 2055 but would apply a 4% tax over new applicants’ capital gains — still far lower than the 20–37% rates that many crypto investors would pay on the mainland. Crypto defenders struggle to preserve the breaks Proponents of the existing tax regime say it has attracted much-needed investment and innovation to Puerto Rico. Rich newcomers, they say, are helping build a more robust technology and finance sector, create jobs, and modernize the island’s economy. Crypto advocates say that without the tax breaks, these investors would have gone elsewhere with their money. But critics are skeptical, noting that most benefits have gone to the wealthy, not to average Puerto Ricans. The political road ahead for the bill appears murky. Republicans have historically favored lower taxes and seem unlikely to sign off on a piece of legislation they view as anti-crypto. Adding another twist to the political poker game, President Donald Trump recently embraced cryptocurrencies . He has vowed to undo regulations that are suffocating the digital asset sector. Velázquez’s bill faces an uphill battle with Congress focused on broader tax arguments. Still, the effort underscores mounting tensions over balancing innovation versus fairness and economic justice — not just in Puerto Rico but nationally.

What Traders Should Know,https://cryptonews.com/news/could-vitaliks-new-code-idea-send-ethereum-soaring-what-traders-should-know/,"Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is once again in the spotlight following a bold proposal from its co-founder, Vitalik Buterin. On April 21, 2025, Buterin outlined a transformative plan to replace the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode with the open-source RISC-V instruction set architecture, aiming to enhance the network’s scalability and efficiency. This development has sparked intense discussion among traders and developers, raising the question: could this be the catalyst to propel Ethereum’s price to new heights? Here’s what traders need to know. Vitalik Proposes Replacing Ethereum’s EVM Code With RICS-V – What Traders Need to Know Buterin’s proposal, detailed on the Ethereum Magicians forum , seeks to overhaul Ethereum’s execution layer by transitioning from the EVM to RISC-V, a standardized and extensible architecture. The plan promises to simplify the network’s codebase while preserving developer-friendly languages like Solidity and Vyper. According to Buterin, this shift could accelerate zero-knowledge (ZK) proof computations by 50–100x, significantly boosting transaction throughput and reducing costs. Additionally, legacy contracts would remain compatible, ensuring a smooth transition for existing applications. These enhancements align with Ethereum’s ongoing efforts, such as the upcoming “Pectra” upgrade on May 7, 2025, which aims to improve scalability and user experience. The potential impact on Ethereum’s market performance is substantial – Improved scalability could attract more developers and decentralized applications (DApps), increasing network activity and demand for Ether (ETH). i just spent hours going through vitalik's new proposal to replace EVM with RISC-V. it makes ethereum blocks 50–100x more efficient. here’s everything you need to know, even if you're not technical ↓ vitalik just proposed something wild: replace the EVM (ethereum virtual… pic.twitter.com/85txtr2w3C — Suhail Kakar ( , ) (@SuhailKakar) April 21, 2025 Recent data from Token Terminal and Santiment indicates declining fee revenue in early 2025, raising concerns about ETH’s long-term value. However, a more efficient execution layer could reverse this trend by enabling cheaper transactions and supporting Layer 2 growth, which Buterin has emphasized as critical for Ethereum’s economy. Yet, the Ethereum price didn’t respond positively on Monday, remaining stuck near $1,500, and traders should approach this narrative with caution. Transitioning to RISC-V is a long-term, multi-phase endeavor, and technical challenges could delay implementation. Past simplifications, like removing the SELFDESTRUCT opcode, faced complications due to legacy behaviors, suggesting potential hurdles. While Buterin’s proposal could bolster investor confidence, macroeconomic factors and market sentiment will also influence ETH’s trajectory. Markets remains highly uncertain about the impact of Trump’s trade war policies on the US and global economy, and risk assets like ETH remain at risk of experiencing further declines. However, Ethereum remains a cornerstone of decentralized finance, with a market cap of approximately $225 billion per CoinMarketCap . Buterin’s vision could strengthen its position, but success hinges on execution. Traders should weigh the long-term potential against short-term volatility, keeping an eye on technical updates and market trends. Ethereum Alternative to Consider – Best Wallet (BEST) Whilst the Ethereum price remains at risk of further declines in the near future despite Buterin’s bold proposal, savvy crypto investors would do well to diversify into alternative high-potential projects that might be able to outperform in difficult market conditions.

In 2017 it was Ethereum , in 2020 it was Solana , and in 2021 Shiba Inu stunned the world. Now, as we enter the heart of 2025, a familiar pair— Bitcoin and XRP —remain firmly in investor portfolios. But a new name is turning heads: MAGACOINFINANCE . Early-stage traders and analysts are watching closely as capital flows rotate into the next wave of growth assets. While large-cap tokens will likely continue their slow and steady climbs, the real potential for outsized returns lies in smaller, faster-moving projects like MAGACOINFINANCE —which many believe could become the surprise of the year. PRESALE SELLING OUT – CLICK HERE TO SECURE A SPOT NOW MAGACOINFINANCE Is the Talk Among Smart Money MAGACOINFINANCE saw an instant wave of interest from the market — a clear signal of rising investor confidence and early-stage demand. What began as early chatter has transformed into serious momentum. Wallet creation is up, retention data shows strong hands, and social signals continue to climb. Now, with analysts placing the project in a momentum scenario , it’s being tracked as one of the most likely breakout plays for Q2 and beyond. The combination of smart tokenomics, low entry valuation, and fast-growing user engagement has pushed MAGACOINFINANCE to the top of early mover lists. The structure is familiar—this is exactly what early accumulation looked like before Solana , Polygon , and Aptos made headlines. Where It Stands: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Aptos, and Injective Bitcoin continues to offer long-term stability, but it’s rarely where explosive returns are found anymore. Ethereum is still the Layer-1 leader but has shifted into an infrastructure role, trading more like a blue-chip. Aptos brings speed and innovation, but has not yet found its breakout moment with the broader market. Injective is gaining traction in decentralized trading, but remains volatile and sector-limited. MAGACOINFINANCE , by contrast, is early and expanding quickly. it’s modeled using volume trends, wallet behavior, and prior breakout cycles. And for many investors seeking pre-listing entries, it may be the strongest opportunity in the field right now. GET 50% EXTRA BONUS – USE CODE MAGA50X – LIMITED TIME OFFER Conclusion XRP and Bitcoin will continue to hold down the foundation of the crypto economy, and projects like Ethereum , Aptos , and Injective will push innovation forward.

Analysts Say These Key Indicators Look Bullish,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-rally-ahead-analysts-say-these-key-indicators-look-bullish/,"Bitcoin (BTC) posted modest gains earlier today, trading above $87,000 for the first time since April 1. Crypto analysts now suggest that BTC may be on the verge of a sustained rally, as several key indicators are flashing bullish signals. Bitcoin Rally Ahead? These Indicators Say Yes According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post published today, BTC is showing multiple short-term bullish signals, fuelling optimism that a breakout above $90,000 could be imminent. Related Reading: Bitcoin Undervalued? Analyst Breaks Down Bullish On-Chain Metrics In their analysis, CryptoQuant contributor EgyHash highlighted two key indicators that hint at bullish reversal for the apex cryptocurrency. First, the contributor outlined BTC’s Exchange Inflow metric. EgyHash noted that exchange inflows – the amount of BTC being deposited into exchanges – have dropped significantly in recent months. Since peaking at 120,000 in November 2024, the metric has seen a sharp decline, suggesting that holders are choosing not to move their BTC to exchanges, thereby potentially reducing sell pressure. The chart below shows a consistent drop in exchange inflows since November 2024, despite BTC’s price gains in December 2024 and January 2025. As of now, exchange inflows sit around 9,300. In addition, EgyHash pointed out that Bitcoin’s open interest has surged by $6 billion over the past two weeks. This rise has been accompanied by a positive shift in funding rates, signalling a bullish market outlook. To explain, a rise in open interest shows that more money is flowing into BTC futures or perpetual contracts, indicating increased trader participation and confidence. Similarly, positive funding rates suggest that long positions – bets on BTC price going up – are dominant, and traders are willing to pay a premium to hold these positions. That said, there is some caution to be considered here. If the BTC derivatives market becomes too leveraged, then it may increase the risk of a sharp price correction due to mass liquidations. BTC Breaks Multi-Month Downtrend In a separate X post, crypto analyst Rekt Capital brought attention to BTC breaking out of a falling wedge pattern on the daily chart. Typically, a breakout from the falling wedge pattern indicates a bullish reversal, hinting that the asset’s price may rise after a period of downward consolidation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Buy Signal Confirmed? Analysts Highlight Key Reversal Zone In Play Simultaneously, BTC’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching the 60 level, indicating renewed buying strength. That said, if RSI nears 60 but fails to push higher, it could also point to weakening momentum and a potential bull trap. Further, BTC’s futures sentiment index is showing signs of warning as the metric has been on a prolonged decline since February 2025. At press time, BTC trades at $87,386, up 3.4% in the past 24 hours.

According to a press release on Apr. 21, the Circle Payments Network connects banks, fintech firms, digital wallets, and other financial institutions to enable real-time, cross-border transactions using regulated stablecoins like USD Coin ( USDC ) and EURC ( EURC ) International payments currently involve a number of intermediaries, slow settlement times, and high fees, especially for users in emerging markets. CPN is designed to tackle the inefficiencies by combining robust compliance standards, such as KYC/AML and cybersecurity procedures, with 24/7 stablecoin settlement. Treasury operations, onchain financial applications, payroll, remittances, and business payments are some of the many use cases that CPN supports. The system allows developers to create financial tools and workflows directly on top of the network through the use of smart contracts and modular application programming interfaces.

Several other fintechs and infrastructure partners, including BCB Group, Flutterwave, dLocal, Coins.ph, Zodia Markets, and Fireblocks, are helping build out integrations and local currency access points. Circle’s leadership believes CPN could become the backbone of a programmable, always-on financial system. “Since our founding, Circle’s vision has been to make moving money as simple and efficient as sending an email,” said Jeremy Allaire, Circle’s co-founder and CEO. “CPN is a significant step in making that vision a reality for businesses worldwide.” The network is expected to launch in a limited capacity in May 2025, with participation open to licensed financial institutions globally. The launch comes as Circle and other crypto companies like Coinbase, Paxos, and BitGo are reportedly preparing to apply for banking licenses in the U.S., according to The Wall Street Journal’s Apr. 21 report . Both crypto-native companies and established banks like Standard Chartered and Deutsche Bank are positioning themselves to increase their presence in the U.S. crypto market as a result of changing regulatory attitudes.

The S&P 500 has now declined by more than 12% since the beginning of the year, and the Nasdaq is down almost 18% in the US tech stock exodus. US stock heatmap. Source: TradingView The stock slide follows escalating tension between Donald Trump and Jerome Powell and growing concern over the impact of trade tariffs. “‘Preemptive Cuts’ in Interest Rates are being called for by many,” Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social on April 21. “With Energy Costs way down, food prices substantially lower, and most other ‘things’ trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,” he added. Trump has reiterated his call for lowering interest rates, which Powell, who has been labelled as “Mr. Too Late” and a “major loser” by the POTUS, has kept high at 4.5%. Source: Donald Trump Last week, Powell took a swipe at Trump’s trade tariffs, saying they could lead to a dangerous economic mix of rising prices and slowing growth, or “stagflation.” Trump responded with a call to fire the central bank chair, stating at the time that his “termination cannot come fast enough.” The Fed is expected to maintain its wait-and-see policy approach at its May 7 meeting, with interest rate markets predicting just a 13% chance of a rate cut, according to CME Fed Watch. US dollar devaluation continues The US Dollar Index (DXY) — a measure of the strength of the greenback against a basket of leading currencies — has also slipped more than 10% so far this year. This week it fell to a three-year low below 98 on April 21, according to TradingView. “Everyone needs and wants a weaker dollar to service their dollar debts,” commented Real Vision founder and CEO Raoul Pal on April 22. “This is the purest form of global liquidity and is the largest driver of global M2 [money supply] currently,” he added.

Known for his pro-crypto stance, Atkins’ appointment is being hailed as the beginning of a new era for digital asset regulation in the United States. This marks a return to the SEC for Chairman Atkins, who previously served as a Commissioner from 2002 to 2008 under President George W. Bush. During that time, he was known for championing transparency, consistency, and the use of cost-benefit analysis in regulatory decision-making—principles that many hope he will now apply to modern crypto policy. The industry has been eagerly awaiting his arrival. While Acting Chair Hester Peirce and interim leader Mark Uyeda have made strides—particularly in fostering transparency and holding crypto roundtables—Atkins is expected to bring greater momentum and authority to the agency’s crypto-related efforts. “As I return to the SEC, I am pleased to join with my fellow Commissioners and the agency’s dedicated professionals to advance its mission to facilitate capital formation; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and protect investors,” Atkins said. He added, “ Together we will work to ensure that the U.S. is the best and most secure place in the world to invest and do business.” Under Peirce’s leadership, the SEC has already made headway, dropping several high-profile cases and providing new guidance around crypto mining, stablecoins, and meme coins. However, areas like NFTs and token classification remain complex and unresolved. With Atkins now in charge, insiders expect swift movement toward a standardized “token test” to determine whether a digital asset should be classified as a security.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-22 03:38:05

But as 2025 unfolds, analysts are turning their eyes to newer entries that offer better positioning for exponential growth. While familiar names like Cardano (ADA) , Polygon (MATIC) , Kaspa (KAS) , and Tron (TRX) hold their ground, MAGACOINFINANCE is surging forward—and fast. GET 50% EXTRA BONUS – USE CODE MAGA50X – LIMITED TIME OFFER Why MAGACOINFINANCE Has Become a Magnet for Early Entry MAGACOINFINANCE surged with attention just minutes after launching, emerging as one of the most talked-about projects of 2025. Its quick rise in visibility has drawn the attention of traders and analysts alike. Here’s why: Immediate Acceleration: From the moment of its launch, MAGACOINFINANCE began trending across early-stage investor communities and was quickly added to top altcoin watchlists. Early Access Through Limited Distribution: The project’s exclusive availability during its pre-sale phase gives it an edge over widely accessible coins like ADA and MATIC. Better Momentum Than Other Rising Alts: MAGACOINFINANCE is already outpacing the visibility and engagement of peers like Kaspa (KAS) and Tron (TRX) , further fueling interest among early-stage seekers. How MAGACOINFINANCE Compares to the Competition XRP: Still a leader in payments, though its current upside is widely considered limited. Solana (SOL): Technologically robust, but many believe its growth window is narrowing. Cardano (ADA): Strong in vision, though investor momentum has slowed. Polygon (MATIC): Consistently useful, but unlikely to post exponential gains. In contrast, MAGACOINFINANCE combines early-stage appeal with real-world demand indicators—making it the clear outlier for potential upside.

This brings its total holdings to 4,855 BTC. The latest purchase, which is worth approximately 4.02 billion yen ($26.6 million), was executed at an average price of 12,181,570 yen per Bitcoin. This marks Metaplanet’s third BTC acquisition in April 2025 alone. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Push Based on current market prices, with Bitcoin trading above $87,300, the company’s total BTC holdings are now worth over $423 million. Metaplanet has funded these strategic acquisitions through capital market activities and operating income to boost shareholder value through Bitcoin exposure. The firm utilizes a metric known as “BTC Yield” to evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy. BTC Yield reflects the change in the ratio of Bitcoin holdings to fully diluted shares outstanding, and offers insight into Bitcoin accretion net of share dilution. For the current quarter to date (April 1-21, 2025), Metaplanet has reported a BTC Yield of 12.1%, following a 95.6% yield in the previous quarter. In addition to BTC Yield, Metaplanet also reports BTC Gain and BTC ¥ Gain. These two metrics help quantify the hypothetical increase in Bitcoin holdings and their yen-equivalent value, respectively, assuming no share dilution. These performance indicators aim to provide greater transparency and context for shareholders monitoring the financial impact of the company’s Bitcoin strategy. Metaplanet’s aggressive accumulation of Bitcoin has placed it among the top ten public holders globally. This milestone was achieved earlier this month. While broader markets contend with global tariff concerns and waning investor sentiment, Metaplanet continues to lean into digital assets. Another Japanese Firm Joins Bitcoin Wave Other Japanese firms are beginning to follow suit. For instance, fashion company ANAP Holdings recently acquired over 16 BTC via its subsidiary, ANAP Lightning Capital. The move was indicative of a growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency within Japan’s corporate landscape. The company reportedly stated, “The global trend of BTC becoming a reserve asset is irreversible.” The post Metaplanet Makes 3rd Bitcoin Purchase in April, Expands Holdings to Over $423 Million appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin|Japan|Metaplanet,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-04-22 03:55:07

This move could pave the way for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF)—a product the crypto industry has long been pushing for. Historically, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has pointed to the existence of a regulated futures market as a key requirement for approving spot crypto ETFs. Bitcoin and Ethereum followed a similar path, with futures-based products hitting the market before their respective spot ETFs received the green light. Until now, many of these structured products were only available through offshore exchanges, which often raised concerns about trust and counterparty risk. With Coinbase offering these tools in the U.S., institutions now have a safer and more reputable option for trading and structuring investments. This development follows the recent launch of Solana futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and comes amid a backlog of 72 crypto-related ETF applications currently awaiting SEC review. Several of those applications include XRP and Solana among their proposed holdings. XRP Price Action: Dip After the News Despite the positive news, XRP’s price has dipped slightly following the announcement. As of press time, XRP is trading at $2.0736, down 2% on the day. The cryptocurrency failed to hold above the key $2.10 resistance level and has since pulled back, retesting broken support as new resistance.

Since launch, MAGACOINFINANCE has been gaining traction across both retail and institutional circles. The token’s growth is being driven by strong community engagement, high-volume wallet creation, and a sharp uptick in social metrics. The token’s structure—low initial valuation, capped supply, and early network effects—is exactly what early investors look for. It’s a formula that mirrors the beginning of past surges in tokens like Ethereum , Solana , and Polygon . ROI Outlook: Comparing Ethereum, Solana, Optimism, and Injective Ethereum remains the dominant Layer-1 for decentralized infrastructure, but its upside is increasingly modest. Solana continues to attract developers and scale dApps, yet its largest run-up may be behind it. Optimism is emerging as a major Layer-2 solution, though it faces scalability bottlenecks and rising competition. Injective is pushing boundaries in decentralized trading but is still limited in ecosystem depth. MAGACOINFINANCE , on the other hand, is at the start of its momentum cycle. The excitement is built on active accumulation, fast-growing visibility, and structural factors that have historically led to exponential growth.

There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2.080 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might gain bullish momentum if it clears the $2.150 resistance zone. XRP Price Trims Gains XRP price started a recovery wave above the $2.050 and $2.080 resistance levels, like Bitcoin and Ethereum .

On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.10 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.120 level. The next resistance is $2.150. A clear move above the $2.150 resistance might send the price toward the $2.20 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.220 resistance or even $2.250 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.350. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.10 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.080 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $2.060 level.

ADA is currently probing its 21DMA, having consistently found resistance at it in recent weeks. If it finds resistance at its 21DMA again, that would signal that the bears remain in control of this market, and that a drop to new lows would be likely. Indeed, the risks of a 50% drop for the Cardano price ll the way back to 2024 lows in the $0.30 area is growing increasingly likely. Here’s why. Macro Uncertainties Continue Ramping Higher – Cardano Price to Crash 50%? US versus rest of the world trade war headlines remained confusing as of Monday the 21st of April. As sentiment related to the severity of the trade war waxes and wanes, markets will continue to experience short-term volatility, with ADA no exception. That said, traders would do well to focus on the bigger macro picture. As highlighted by various macro analysts, Trump’s trade war appears to be an inadvertent attack on the USD as the global reserve asset. CEA Chairman Stephen Miran says USD reserve asset status is a problem. The Trump administration may move to purposely dismantle USD hegemony. The average person on this platform has literally no idea what they are watching right now! pic.twitter.com/QzGSnXHI2F — Philip Pilkington (@philippilk) April 7, 2025 That’s because consistent US trade deficits with the rest of the world have been a key feature of the global financial order with USD at its centre. With that context in mind, macro price moves in recent weeks make a lot of sense – the DXY and USD denominated assets like US stocks and bonds have all experienced significant selling pressure as international investors shift funds out of the US dollar. A rare “SELL AMERICA” moment is unfolding. For the first time since 1981, the US dollar index is down over 5%, the S&P 500 is off more than 5%, and 10-year Treasury yields have climbed 10bps—all in just a month. That combo hasn’t hit since the double-dip recession days. pic.twitter.com/tkB07G4o8T — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) April 21, 2025 Gold has been the biggest winner so far, but strong price action in recent days suggests Bitcoin might be beginning to catch up as its safe haven/neutral reserve asset narrative grows. Does this mean altcoins like Cardano might also soon explode? Well, that’s not likely. Behind strong demand for gold (and increasingly now also Bitcoin) is uncertainty about the global financial order, which is not a good environment for the riskiest of risk assets, cryptos like Cardano . The US economy could soon slide into recession and with the Fed intent to sit on their hands due to concerns about sticky inflation, now is probably not a good time to be buying Cardano. Indeed, if things get really bad, a collapse all the way back to 2024 lows in the $0.30 area would be possible for the Cardano price. Buy the ADA Dip? But just because the medium-term outlook for the Cardano price isn’t strong right now doesn’t mean that it’s not a good idea for long-term investors to accumulate. Cardano remains one of the crypto industry’s most promising layer-1 projects. The blockchain recently switched to full decentralized governance and is set to become a leading Bitcoin DeFi side chain in 2025.

Crypto comes home. Watch the full video to see what’s now possible pic.twitter.com/1REY9dFjQe — BitcoinOS (@BTC_OS) April 17, 2025 ADA remains much more speculative than blockchains like Ethereum and Solana that have achieved much higher levels of adoption. Indeed, a common criticism of Cardano is that it is a “ghost chain” – an accusation based on its much lower levels of on-chain activity versus major competitors. Per DeFi Llama , Cardano has a TVL of around $300 million versus over $46 billion on Ethereum. But with a market cap of last around $22 billion, versus $72 billion for Solana and $190 billion for Ethereum, it has a lot more upside potential if things go well. And go well things are very likely to happen in the coming years, once near-term macro uncertainties clear up. That’s because the Trump administration is ardently pro-crypto and intent on supporting growth in the industry through favorable policies. Once macro uncertainties start to clear and US liquidity really starts to flow again, the Cardano price could experience a major comeback. It may even clear its old record highs above $3.0 in the coming years, a 5x rally from current levels.

The Supreme Court of Gibraltar has reversed its decision to freeze 542 million PLAY tokens in a court battle between two companies tied to the Web3 game-creation platform PLAY Network. In an April 17 judgment , Gibraltar Supreme Court Judge John Restano undid his earlier February freeze of the tokens, finding it could have hurt the value of the tokens and that the evidence filed was insufficient to continue the freeze. “Whilst there may be many reasons for the drop in value of the tokens, the evidence before the court suggests that these proceedings are a factor in that regard,” he wrote. US-based Ready Makers, which operates as Ready Games, and its founder, David Bennahum, have filed a legal dispute against its Gibraltar-based subsidiary, Ready Maker (Gibraltar) Limited, and its CEO, Christina Macedon. The suit claims she took over the firm and its PLAY token that is used as a reward on the PLAY Network. Ready Games won a freeze of the tokens in February, with the Gibraltar-based Ready Maker, operating as PLAY Network, handing them over to a court-appointed custodian. The 542 million PLAY tokens are nearly two-thirds of its current circulating supply and are worth around $2.6 million. The token’s price has plummeted by over 97% since it launched in December, according to CoinGecko. PLAY has sunk over the past three months to trade for fractions of a cent. Source: CoinGecko Judge Restano said the evidence filed by Ready Games for the freeze was “far from impressive, and raises more questions than it answers.” He added he did “not consider that this is a case where the order should be re-granted in any event,” and cited Ready Games’ failure to disclose that it was in administrative dissolution at the time of filing for the token freeze, which he called “a significant omission.” Macedo said in a statement that she saw “months of false and misleading statements made during the dispute,” and the judgment “restores clarity for our community and partners.” Ready Games’ Bennahum told Cointelegraph that it has filed to lodge an appeal alongside “an urgent application with the Gibraltar Court of Appeal asking them to either stay the discharge of the original injunction or grant a new injunction” so the tokens could again be frozen pending the appeal's outcome. He added that his company disagreed with the court’s decision to lift the token freeze, saying that the Gibraltar-based firm was in an “alarming state.” Ready Maker is just a “token launch vehicle” — Ready Games founder Bennahum reiterated an earlier claim that the US-based Ready Games created Ready Maker in Gibraltar with the US company’s intellectual property and funding “specifically to serve as our token launch vehicle.” “We maintain that Ms. Macedo and associated parties have wrongfully seized control of this entity and its assets,” he said. Judge Restano said in his judgment that Macedo disputed Bennahum’s claim, and regulatory filings purportedly show she is the sole controller and ultimate beneficial owner of the Gibraltar-based firm.

Though it has since slightly pulled back to around $86,815 at the time of writing, the asset’s gradual recovery since last week appears to be building a foundation for potential upward movement. Analysts now seem to be monitoring technical and on-chain trends as sentiment begins to lean toward a short-term bullish outlook. Particularly, on-chain data platform CryptoQuant has highlighted notable shifts in market behavior, including insights into funding rates, investor positioning, and psychological resistance levels. Despite the gains, not all investor groups are experiencing profits, with short-term holders still facing unrealized losses. Related Reading: What’s Next For Bitcoin After Crossing $87,000? Expert Discusses Possible Outcomes Several Bitcoin Bullish Signals Identified A recent analysis shared by CryptoQuant contributor EgyHash outlines several indicators suggesting that Bitcoin could be preparing for another upward leg. The analyst points out a significant $6 billion rise in open interest across derivatives markets over the past two weeks. Open interest measures the total value of outstanding futures contracts, and its growth typically reflects increased participation or confidence in the direction of price movement. This metric, coupled with a rise in funding rates, indicates an uptick in long-position interest among traders. Another key metric, exchange inflows, which track how much Bitcoin is being moved onto centralized exchanges, has declined notably during this same period. When fewer coins are sent to exchanges, it can imply reduced intent to sell, as holders typically deposit assets to liquidate them. This reduction in exchange inflow has been interpreted as a decrease in selling pressure, potentially supporting a more stable price environment in the short term. These on-chain metrics collectively hint at a market that may be gearing up for a continuation of its current trend, assuming external variables remain favorable. New Investors In Profit While Short-Term Holders Face Struggle While certain metrics lean bullish, a deeper look at investor categories reveals diverging outcomes. Another CryptoQuant analyst, Crazzyblockk, points out that Short-Term Holders (STHs), or those who purchased BTC within the last six months, remain in an unrealized loss position. Their average acquisition price stands at approximately $91,000, forming a key resistance level that may influence upcoming price movement. As long as Bitcoin trades below this level, latent sell pressure could persist, especially if upward momentum stalls. Conversely, new investors — defined as those who entered the market within the past month — have recently returned to profit. With a realized gain of 3.73%, this group is showing signs of renewed confidence, potentially contributing to near-term price support. Related Reading: Bitcoin Surges Above $87,000 In Sudden Move — Here’s The Catalyst However, according to the analyst, the current risk zone remains active until Bitcoin firmly closes above the $91,000 mark. Crazzyblockk wrote: Until BTC closes above the $91K threshold, Short-Term Holders remain in loss. This may sustain latent sell pressure, especially if price momentum weakens — reinforcing the importance of a decisive breakout above STH realized price to neutralize this overhang.

Acting Chairman Caroline Pham noted in the press release that the CFTC should embrace a progressive stance to shifts in market structure to ensure their markets remain vibrant and resilient while safeguarding all participants. She pointed to the increasing trend toward extended trading hours, noting the move to “24/7, 24/6, or 24/5 trading hours” as an example. U.S. regulators weigh 24/7 trading and perpetual futures The proposal follows similar developments in equities markets. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved 24 Exchanges to operate nearly around-the-clock, offering 23-hour trading days, five days a week. Nasdaq has also indicated it plans to extend its weekly trading hours. Meanwhile, some brokers, such as Robinhood Markets Inc,. already provide retail investors with 24-hour trading during the workweek. The CFTC also requests feedback on allowing perpetual futures—a derivative contract widely used outside the United States, particularly in digital asset markets. While the regulatory environment has become friendlier for those assets under President Donald Trump, perpetual futures contracts for cryptos remain largely unavailable to Americans. According to the agency, perpetual futures , commonly known as “perps,” do not have an expiration date. Instead, they are settled continuously, with pricing and margin calculations often occurring multiple times daily. The markets regulator stated that although some traders may find them appealing, the differences between the structure of existing derivatives contracts and perpetual contracts may raise novel questions and concerns related to trading and clearing risk management. According to a March blog post, Coinbase’s derivatives exchange intends to introduce “perpetual style” and 24/7 cryptocurrency futures trading. It has taken longer for other derivatives markets to follow suit. Korea exchange pushes ahead with 12-hour night trading Other major exchanges worldwide have also considered continuous trading. The Korea Exchange plans to launch its own independent night trading for derivatives in June. Announced on April 3, the strategic pivot marks a departure from the existing structure in which KOSPI 200 futures and options are listed and traded on the Europe-based derivatives exchange, Eurex. The Korea Exchange believes that opening up its own night trading system will enhance its global competitiveness and offer more convenience to investors. Under this new initiative, the exchange plans to expand its derivatives offerings. Korea Exchange, which currently provides five products, is working on providing more, such as U.S. dollar futures and government bond futures, to lure more investors and allow for more effective risk hedging. The exchange will also modernize by lengthening its trading day by an hour. The new schedule will extend trading hours from 6 PM to 6 AM the following day, creating a 12-hour trading day that fits into that window.

DOGE is consolidating and might aim for an upside break above the $0.1650 resistance. DOGE price started a decent upward move above the $0.1550 level. The price is trading above the $0.1580 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a short-term bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1590 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start a fresh increase if it clears the $0.1650 resistance zone. Dogecoin Price Turns Red Dogecoin price started a fresh decline after it failed to clear $0.1640, unlike Bitcoin and like Ethereum . DOGE dipped below the $0.1620 and $0.1600 support levels. The bears were able to push the price below the $0.1565 support level. It even traded close to the $0.1550 support. A low was formed at $0.1558 and the price recently corrected some losses. There was a minor move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1635 swing high to the $0.1558 low. Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.1580 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Besides, there is a short-term bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1590 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.1620 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1635 swing high to the $0.1558 low. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.1640 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.1650 level. A close above the $0.1650 resistance might send the price toward the $0.1720 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.1780 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.1800. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.1620 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1590 level. The next major support is near the $0.1565 level. The main support sits at $0.1550. If there is a downside break below the $0.1550 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.1500 level or even $0.1450 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now above the 50 level.

Economics Professor Comments,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-trump-fire-fed-chairman-jerome-powell-what-will-happen-in-the-markets-if-he-does-economics-professor-comments/,"Despite recent threats from U.S. President Donald Trump that he could fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, economists and lawmakers agree that such a move is unlikely. However, political pressure from Trump's remarks could influence the Fed's decision-making process. Francesco Bianchi, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University, told reporters that while Trump is not expected to follow through on his threats, his rhetoric on the issue could influence public perception and therefore the central bank’s actions. “The Fed now knows that if there is a recession, it will be blamed,” Bianchi said, adding that Trump’s public calls for rate cuts could increase pressure on policymakers. The row erupted last week after Powell suggested there was no urgent need to cut interest rates, prompting Trump to respond with a stern warning that he could fire the Fed chair. The comments triggered a sharp stock market decline as investors worried the Fed's independence was being compromised. Related News: Unlucky Giant Cryptocurrency Whale Lost $17 Million on This Altcoin It Bought Just One Month Ago The chances of Trump actually firing Powell are slim, according to Bianchi. “Powell’s term is up in about a year,” he explained. “Firing him would create significant market turmoil that would outweigh any short-term political gains. Markets would likely interpret this as a sign of future rate hikes, not cuts.” Amid the growing controversy, key lawmakers have rejected Trump’s comments, with Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana and a member of the Senate Banking Committee rejecting the president’s assertion of authority over the central banker. “I don’t think the president, any president, has the authority to remove the chairman of the Fed,” Kennedy said in an interview with NBC. “The Fed should remain independent.” Speaking from the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump reiterated his claim, saying, “If I had called for his removal, believe me, he would have been removed very quickly.” But Kennedy continued to support Powell’s approach to monetary policy, particularly the president’s focus on controlling inflation. *This is not investment advice.

Last year, Metaplex, an NFT protocol, discovered a way to reduce the amount of onchain storage required for certain NFTs. By resizing the NFTs, Solana NFT holders can claim a small amount of SOL. In October, Metaplex said that Metaplex Token Metadata (TM) NFT holders will be able to execute a “resize optimization” for all TM accounts with a deadline of April 25. Those who didn’t do it voluntarily by the deadline would have their excess SOL transferred to the Metaplex DAO automatically, with how they’re to be used yet to be determined. However, Burwick criticized the firm’s plan to sweep unclaimed funds to its DAO treasury instead of returning them to NFT holders. “Many minters never received clear notice that these lamports could be swept, let alone diverted to a treasury they do not control,” Burwick said in an April 22 open letter to Metaplex and the broader Solana community. Burwick said over 54,000 SOL tokens are at risk, and according to Metaplex’s website, only 7,043 SOL have been claimed. At current market prices, more than $6.5 million remains unclaimed. Burwick said many of the NFT collectors it represents have shared “deep concerns” about the plan. Burwick added that Metaplex’s plan “erodes trust” and “violates the spirit of crypto.” “‘Code is law’ only works when the rules are clear and immutable. If a protocol can rewrite yesterday’s deal tomorrow, the promise of decentralised permanence rings hollow.” Source: Burwick Law Burwick said such a move could entitle victims to restitution should a court find the sweep constituted unjust enrichment or violates consumer protection laws. Metaplex hasn’t responded to Burwick’s X post. Cointelegraph reached out to Metaplex but didn’t receive an immediate response. Metaplex said the unclaimed SOL may be used for the DAO to vote on airdrops, distribute grants to ecosystem builders, or other initiatives. Source: Metaplex Burwick pitches what Metaplex should do instead The crypto lawyers advised Metaplex to pause the plan and refund rent directly to current NFT holders while retaining a “modest” network-maintenance bounty of 10%. “A 90 / 10 split protects users, preserves DAO funding, and proves that the Solana ecosystem can self‑regulate—without a courtroom.” Related: Coinbase distances Base from highly criticized memecoin that dumped $15M Burwick noted that other DeFi protocols have resolved similar issues this way. The lawyers said there is still plenty of time for Metaplex to execute such a strategy and avoid litigation where funds could be frozen. “The ball is in the DAO’s court.

Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.09% to 21,292 in early trade on Tuesday. Trading resumed in the city after the holiday break, weighed down by fresh tensions as China warned it would retaliate against any trade deals with the U.S. that undermine its interests. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.35% In response to a significant increase in inexpensive steel shipments, primarily originating from China, India, the world's second-largest producer of crude steel, has levied a temporary 12% tariff, known domestically as a safeguard duty, on specified steel imports. This duty, effective for 200 days commencing Monday, April 21st, is designed to protect domestic producers from perceived unfair market pressures. India’s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will meet US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Washington this week, as both nations move toward finalizing a trade pact later this year.

Market participants are also eyeing Australia’s upcoming PMI data later this week for additional insight into the health of the domestic economy.

XRP and SOLANA Are Watching!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-magacoinfinance-be-the-next-crypto-titan-xrp-and-solana-are-watching/,"XRP remains one of the most resilient tokens in digital finance, powering cross-border solutions with regulatory backing. Solana has become the leading high-speed blockchain, hosting some of the most active developer ecosystems. These are proven players. But 2025 may introduce a new name into that top-tier conversation— MAGACOINFINANCE . Analysts and early investors are now asking the same question: Could MAGACOINFINANCE be the next project to evolve from hidden gem to crypto titan? PRESALE SELLING OUT – CLICK HERE TO SECURE A SPOT NOW MAGACOINFINANCE Could Lead the 2025 Altcoin Rally MAGACOINFINANCE gained immediate traction at launch, positioning it as one of the fastest-growing altcoin entries of the year. That early surge hasn’t faded—it’s growing. With a steady stream of new wallet creation, explosive community growth, and bullish sentiment across analyst circles, MAGACOINFINANCE is beginning to show the early footprint of a breakout token. Analysts now forecast a upside scenario , placing it on par with the breakout potential seen in previous cycles with tokens like Solana and Polygon . Its fundamentals are aligned for acceleration: capped supply, fast user onboarding, and market visibility before mainstream exposure. The question is no longer if it will move—but how far and how fast. Evaluating the Field: Cardano, Bitcoin, Sei, and Polkadot Cardano continues to push slow but methodical upgrades—its upside is limited by the pace of ecosystem adoption. Bitcoin leads as a macro asset, but most investors now view it as a long-hold store of value rather than a rapid growth play. Sei is an intriguing Layer-1 but still early in its discovery phase with low institutional awareness. Polkadot remains a multichain pioneer, yet continues to struggle with narrative traction and price expansion. MAGACOINFINANCE enters this landscape with clear momentum and lower market saturation. The high projection isn’t a moonshot—it’s a data-backed view grounded in metrics like volume trends, wallet activity, and presale acceleration. It’s showing the same chart behavior that once defined early Solana and XRP moments. GET 50% EXTRA BONUS – USE CODE MAGA50X – LIMITED TIME OFFER Conclusion As legacy players like XRP and Solana continue to perform, and foundational projects like Cardano , Bitcoin , Sei , and Polkadot hold their lanes, smart capital is also seeking asymmetric returns.

Atkins has formally assumed his position as the 34th Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The swearing was officially confirmed by an Apr. 21 press release from the SEC. Atkins was nominated by President Donald Trump on Jan. 20 and confirmed by the Senate earlier this month. Atkins returns to the SEC after previously serving as commissioner from 2002 to 2008 under President George W. Bush. He most recently ran Patomak Global Partners, a regulatory consulting firm, and has advised several blockchain and fintech startups. He also co-chaired the Token Alliance and served as an expert witness in crypto-related litigation. Ethics filings show Atkins and his wife hold between $327 million and $588.8 million in total assets, including $6 million in digital asset exposure. Before his confirmation, he held stakes in Anchorage Digital, Securitize, and a $5 million LP interest in Off the Chain Capital, all of which he has agreed to divest. You might also like: Avid crypto advocate and investor Paul Atkins will soon become the SEC chair: What to expect? “I am honored by the trust and confidence President Trump and the Senate have placed in me to lead the SEC,” Atkins said in a statement. “Together we will work to ensure that the U.S. is the best and most secure place in the world to invest and do business.” During his Senate confirmation hearing in March, Atkins criticized the previous SEC administration under Gary Gensler for being vague and overly aggressive toward the crypto industry. He pledged to reduce political interference, promote clear digital asset regulations, and support capital formation. Industry observers believe Atkins’ leadership will mark a major turning point in SEC policy away from enforcement-driven actions and toward a clearer regulatory environment. With Atkins at the helm, expectations are high for faster exchange-traded funds approvals, friendlier rules for token issuers, and a more cooperative approach to crypto oversight. His swearing-in comes amid reports that major crypto firms like Coinbase, Circle, and Paxos are reportedly preparing to apply for U.S. banking licenses, encouraged by what sources call a more favorable environment in Washington. Several ETF applications are also awaiting SEC approval.

It is the highest the asset has been since March 7, according to CoinGecko, and represents a gain of 18% since its 2025 low of $75,000 earlier this month.

US stock markets have started the week in the red with daily losses of around 2.5% on the three major indexes, the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones. President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell continued to face off, with the central banker being labelled a “major loser” by Trump for failing to reduce interest rates. The S&P 500 has now erased $2.5 trillion since the April 9 high after the 90-day tariff “pause,” observed the Kobeissi Letter. On April 20, China warned that countries that cooperate with the US in ways that compromise their interests will be retaliated against. On April 21, Japan’s Prime Minister said his country won’t keep conceding in US tariff talks. “If Japan concedes everything, we won’t be able to secure our national interest,” Shigeri Ishiba said. “The US is trying to commit economic suicide, and everyone is dumping US assets in response,” opined economist Alex Krüger. Where are the trade deals? The S&P 500 has now erased -$2.5 TRILLION since the April 9th high after the 90-day tariff “pause.” While markets await trade deals, Japan just said they “won’t just keep conceding” in US tariff talks.

Since April 7, the yellow metal is up over 15% while BTC has gained more than 18%. “Markets are pricing in US dollar weakness and more instability,” it said before adding, “Bonds are no longer a preferred safe haven.” Bitcoin Dominance Peaks Bitcoin dominance has also reached its highest point for four years, hitting 64.6% on April 22, according to TradingView. This is the highest it has been since February 2021, as altcoins failed to move and Ethereum continues to weaken. More than $350 billion has entered crypto markets since the April 7 dip, but the majority of that has gone into Bitcoin. Most of the altcoins are down on the day, with Ethereum tanking back below $1,600, XRP falling back towards $2, Binance Coin dipping below $600, and Solana weakening to $135.

This lawsuit goes way further than the SEC’s original complaint, which listed 13 tokens. The Oregon case expands that number to 31, calling them “crypto securities” and alleging they were offered and sold as investment contracts through Coinbase and Coinbase Prime. What’s raising eyebrows is the inclusion of XRP, especially since Coinbase delisted the token shortly after the SEC sued Ripple in December 2020, and didn’t relist it until after the July 2023 summary judgment from Judge Torres. In that ruling, Judge Torres stated that XRP itself is not a security, a key detail the Oregon complaint does not appear to acknowledge.

The Oregon Attorney General has filed a lawsuit against the crypto exchange, accusing it of offering and selling unregistered securities to users in the state. The lawsuit claims that Coinbase offered and sold at least 31 tokens as unregistered securities, and that includes some big names like XRP, ADA, LINK, AAVE, MKR, and UNI. Oregon Named 31 Tokens as “Crypto Securities” In an ongoing lawsuit, Oregon state is suing Coinbase for violating state securities laws.

Because of this, people lost money, and we think Coinbase should be held responsible.” Oregon specifically names 31 crypto tokens it believes were illegally offered as unregistered securities. These include popular tokens like ADA, SOL, XRP, LINK, AAVE, MATIC, UNI, and many more. Although Oregon is going further than the U.S. SEC, which listed 18 tokens in its lawsuit. Coinbase Responds Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, fired back on X. He criticized Oregon’s Attorney General for filing the lawsuit on behalf of over 500,000 users, without their consent. He also said this lawsuit could hurt the entire crypto industry, not just Coinbase. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Coinbase Derivatives Announces Listing of CFTC-Regulated Futures for XRP: What Next? , Oregon’s Case Impact On XRP Even though Oregon’s lawsuit is only about state rules, it could affect the whole country.

On April 21, Paul Atkins was sworn in as the new chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, ushering in expectations of a more crypto-friendly stance at the regulatory agency. Meanwhile, a separate legislative effort is underway to end Puerto Rico’s appeal as a tax haven for crypto investors, as Representative Nydia Velázquez introduced a bill aimed at aligning the territory’s tax code with federal standards. Paul Atkins Sworn in as SEC Chairman, Ushering in a New Era for Crypto Regulation Paul Atkins has officially been sworn in as the 34th Chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The April 21 swearing-in ceremony marks Atkins’ return to the commission, having previously served as an SEC Commissioner from 2002 to 2008 under the Bush administration. Atkins' confirmation by the US Senate on April 9 in a closely divided 52-44 vote ended weeks of political anticipation and speculation, particularly around his potential impact on the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based financial products. His nomination was notably delayed due to outstanding financial disclosures , including details of significant crypto-related holdings following his marriage into a billionaire family. “I am honored by the trust and confidence President Trump and the Senate have placed in me to lead the SEC,” Atkins said during his swearing-in. “As I return to the SEC, I am pleased to join with my fellow Commissioners and the agency’s dedicated professionals to advance its mission to facilitate capital formation; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and protect investors.” “Together we will work to ensure that the US is the best and most secure place in the world to invest and do business,” he added. A Crypto-Friendly Shift Atkins’ arrival at the helm comes amid growing expectations for a more balanced and constructive relationship between the SEC and the cryptocurrency industry. Under the previous chair Gary Gensler, the commission faced widespread criticism from crypto companies, legal experts, and lawmakers for what many described as an aggressive enforcement-first approach. This approach led to numerous high-profile lawsuits, including those against Coinbase, Consensys, Gemini, and Uniswap—cases that have either been dropped or are reportedly being reconsidered under the new leadership. While Gensler defended his actions as essential to protecting investors in a fast-evolving market, critics accused his SEC of stifling innovation, ignoring calls for clear regulatory guidelines, and relying too heavily on legal action in lieu of policymaking. In stark contrast, Atkins—who has publicly supported market innovation in the past—enters the SEC with ties to the digital asset space. His financial disclosures included investments in Anchorage Digital, a regulated crypto custody platform, and Securitize, a blockchain tokenization firm that enables the digitization of real-world assets. Though questions remain about the extent of Atkins’ crypto investments and how they will be managed to avoid conflicts of interest, many in the blockchain industry view his appointment as a long-overdue reset. Atkins takes over from Acting Chair Mark Uyeda, who served as interim head following Gensler’s resignation and played a key role in beginning the agency’s pivot toward dialogue and collaboration. Uyeda established a Crypto Task Force in January 2025 aimed at improving engagement with blockchain companies, developers, and investors. Atkins is expected to continue supporting the task force while accelerating its objectives, signaling a broader shift from adversarial regulation to proactive policymaking. Industry insiders believe this could mark the start of a golden era for digital asset innovation in the US, with the SEC under Atkins potentially leading the charge in updating outdated securities laws to reflect the modern realities of blockchain finance. Avalanche of Crypto ETFs Incoming Further intensifying the crypto market’s interest in the SEC’s direction is the agency’s current backlog of over 70 cryptocurrency-related exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications awaiting review. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, these proposals cover “everything from XRP, Litecoin and Solana to Penguins, Doge and 2x Melania and everything in between.” James Seyffart, another Bloomberg ETF analyst, previously described the situation as a “spaghetti cannon approach,” suggesting that issuers are flooding the SEC with ideas to test what the new regime might be willing to approve. The ETF race reflects not just speculative fervor but a maturing industry desperate for mainstream access to digital assets through traditional financial vehicles. A green light from the SEC on any of these funds—particularly those tied to altcoins or meme tokens—could trigger massive inflows of institutional capital. Despite his crypto-friendly leanings, Atkins still faces the monumental task of striking a balance between fostering innovation and upholding investor protections. With Congress yet to pass comprehensive crypto legislation, much of the regulatory burden continues to fall on the SEC. His leadership could also have implications beyond crypto, affecting how the commission approaches capital markets, enforcement priorities, and global competitiveness. But for now, all eyes are on his handling of the burgeoning digital asset ecosystem. Whether Atkins delivers clarity, confidence, and collaboration—or faces the same gridlock and criticism as his predecessors—will be a defining question for the SEC and for the future of crypto in America. US Lawmaker Moves to End Puerto Rico’s Crypto Tax Haven Status Meanwhile, a new piece of legislation introduced in the US House of Representatives could upend one of the most attractive tax shelters for cryptocurrency investors: the US territory of Puerto Rico. New York Representative Nydia Velázquez has put forward the Fair Taxation of Digital Assets in Puerto Rico Act, which aims to strip away key crypto-related tax incentives that have made the island a magnet for digital asset millionaires. According to an April 21 Bloomberg report, Velázquez’s bill proposes to amend Puerto Rico’s Internal Revenue Code, effectively requiring certain investors — particularly those profiting from cryptocurrency gains — to pay federal taxes on capital gains, aligning the territory more closely with the mainland US tax regime. “This wave of crypto investors hasn’t helped Puerto Rico’s recovery or strengthened the local economy,” said Velázquez. “Instead, it’s driven up housing costs, pushed out local residents, and added pressure to an island where nearly 40% of people live in poverty — all while costing the federal government billions in lost tax revenue.” Puerto Rico has long served as a legal tax haven for wealthy individuals and investors, especially those involved in cryptocurrencies. Since 2012, the territory has offered generous tax breaks through Acts 20 and 22, which were later consolidated into Act 60 under the Puerto Rico Tax Incentives Code. These laws enable qualifying residents to avoid paying capital gains taxes on income earned after relocating to the island — including profits from digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and NFTs. The island’s favorable treatment of crypto wealth has attracted a number of high-profile industry names, including Pantera Capital founder Dan Morehead, crypto venture capitalist Brock Pierce, and online influencer Logan Paul . Many investors have relocated to Puerto Rico not only for the tropical lifestyle, but also to legally shield millions — or even billions — in crypto profits from mainland US taxes. However, Velázquez’s bill represents a growing political backlash against what critics call ”crypto colonialism” — the notion that wealthy mainland Americans are exploiting Puerto Rico’s tax code while contributing little to its economic revitalization. The proposed legislation seeks to bring tax parity and restore local control over who truly benefits from the island’s incentives. Billions at Stake According to Rep. Velázquez’s office, Puerto Rico could lose as much as $4.5 billion in potential tax revenue between 2020 and 2026 due to the current structure of tax exemptions under Act 60. These losses, critics argue, come at a time when the territory remains deeply burdened by public debt, systemic poverty, and inadequate infrastructure, much of which worsened after Hurricanes Maria and Fiona. In contrast, Puerto Rico’s current governor, Jenniffer González-Colón, has advocated for extending Act 60’s provisions beyond their current expiration in 2035 to 2055, while imposing a 4% capital gains tax on new applicants — a rate still far below the up-to-37% capital gains tax faced by residents in the mainland United States. The governor’s proposal attempts to balance attracting wealthy investors with generating a modest stream of tax revenue. Velázquez’s bill, however, would essentially override the local government's authority on the issue by tying Puerto Rico’s tax treatment of crypto directly to federal law. While the Fair Taxation of Digital Assets in Puerto Rico Act is being lauded by some as a step toward equity and financial accountability, its path through Congress remains uncertain. The legislation will need to navigate a Republican-controlled House and a narrowly divided Senate, where bipartisan cooperation on tax reform has proven difficult. Moreover, the bill enters an already packed legislative calendar. Both chambers are expected to take up votes on stablecoin regulation and a comprehensive crypto oversight framework in the coming months — two hot-button topics that could dominate political bandwidth for the remainder of the year. Crypto advocates are already preparing to lobby against the bill, warning that changing Puerto Rico’s tax laws could destabilize investment flows and discourage US innovation in blockchain technology. Growing Calls for Reform Despite the uncertain legislative future, the bill reflects a growing consensus among some lawmakers that the crypto industry’s free ride may be coming to an end — especially in territories where the social costs of wealth migration are becoming more visible. Beyond Puerto Rico, several states and international jurisdictions are also re-evaluating their crypto taxation frameworks, hoping to strike a balance between attracting capital and avoiding economic inequality. Velázquez, a Democrat and longtime advocate for Puerto Rican autonomy and economic justice, has positioned her bill as part of a broader effort to ensure that the territory's economic policies serve its 3.2 million residents, rather than a small group of ultra-wealthy expats. Whether the bill can muster enough support in a divided Congress remains to be seen — but its introduction alone has reignited debate over crypto’s role in shaping modern tax policy and economic inequality in US territories.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-22 05:30:00

The incident, part of a record-breaking $1.5 billion crypto heist, has seen hackers convert at least $300 million into unrecoverable funds. CEO Ben Zhou provided a detailed update on the situation through a post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Bybit CEO Details Movement Of Stolen Assets Zhou’s “4.21.25 Executive Summary on Hacked Funds” revealed that the total amount stolen amounts to approximately $1.4 billion, primarily comprising around 500,000 Ethereum (ETH). The breakdown of the hacked funds indicates that 68.57% remain traceable, suggesting that a significant portion of the stolen crypto can still be tracked through the blockchain. Conversely, 27.59% have gone dark, meaning these funds are no longer traceable and may be lost. Additionally, 3.84% of the funds have been frozen, potentially due to interventions from law enforcement or regulatory bodies. Related Reading: Analyst’s Bitcoin Price Prediction From March Plays Out, Here’s The Rest Of It The untraceable funds largely flowed into mixers—services that obscure the origin of cryptocurrencies—before being moved through bridges to peer-to-peer (P2P) and over-the-counter (OTC) platforms. One of the mixers identified in the laundering of the stolen funds is Wasabi, linked to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). According to Zhou, after a specific amount of Bitcoin (BTC) was processed through Wasabi, it subsequently entered other mixing services such as CryptoMixer, Tornado Cash, and Railgun. The hackers reportedly utilized various cross-chain and swap services, including Thorchain, eXch, Lombard, LiFi, Stargate, and SunSwap, to facilitate the movement of assets. The ultimate destination for these funds appears to be OTC or P2P fiat currency exchange services, which allow for the conversion of cryptocurrencies into traditional currencies without the need for a centralized exchange. Stolen Crypto Breakdown The update also sheds light on the whereabouts of the stolen assets. A substantial portion of Ethereum has been transferred, with 432,748 ETH—approximately 84.45% of the total—valued at around $1.21 billion, converted from Ethereum to Bitcoin via Thorchain. Of this amount, 67.25% (342,975 ETH, valued at about $960.33 million) has been converted into 10,003 BTC, distributed across 35,772 wallets with an average of 0.28 BTC each. Related Reading: Dogecoin Stalls After 42 Days Of Flat Price Action — Is A Breakdown Coming? Meanwhile, 1.17% (5,991 ETH, approximately $16.77 million) remains on the Ethereum blockchain across 12,490 wallets, averaging 0.48 ETH each. In terms of Bitcoin, 944 BTC—about 6.34%, valued at $90.62 million—has been sent to the Wasabi Mixer, while 531 BTC (equivalent to 18,206 ETH, or 3.57%) has been transferred back from Bitcoin to Ethereum via Thorchain. In light of the ongoing investigation, Bybit has received 5,443 bounty reports related to the hack over the past 60 days, with 70 of those deemed valid. Zhou emphasized the need for more community involvement, inviting bounty hunters to help decode mixers and assist in tracing the remaining stolen funds.

The move would bring traditional markets closer in line with the cryptocurrency sector, which has long operated on a 24/7 basis. In a statement released Monday, acting CFTC Chairman Caroline Pham said the agency must take a forward-looking approach to evolving market structures. “The CFTC must take a forward-looking approach to shifts in market structure to ensure our markets remain vibrant and resilient while protecting all participants,” she said. “One evolving trend is the move to 24/7, 24/6, or 24/5 trading hours.” . @CFTC Staff Seek Public Comment Regarding Perpetual Contracts in Derivatives Markets: https://t.co/ClsaxSYKnY — CFTC (@CFTC) April 21, 2025 CFTC Proposal Follows Industry Trend Toward Always-On Market Access The request for comment comes as market participants increasingly push for more flexible trading windows. US equities exchanges are already expanding access. The Securities and Exchange Commission has approved 24 Exchange to operate nearly around the clock five days a week, while Nasdaq has announced similar plans. Brokers like Robinhood already allow 24-hour trading during the workweek. Crypto exchanges, in contrast, have offered continuous trading for years. Traders can buy and sell digital assets at any hour, across borders, with high liquidity and real-time price discovery. The CFTC’s proposal suggests a willingness to align traditional derivatives markets with this model, a shift that could increase accessibility for global participants and enhance responsiveness to macroeconomic events. With Trump-Era Shift in Tone, CFTC Tests Market Appetite for Perps The agency is also considering whether to allow perpetual future s, a contract type widely used in crypto markets but still largely unavailable to US traders. These contracts, known as “perps,” do not expire and are settled continuously throughout the day. Coinbase and other digital asset platforms have expressed interest in launching 24/7 and perpetual-style products in the US. The CFTC’s role is expected to expand under the Trump administration . The agency is set to take on broader oversight of the digital asset market. This shift comes alongside recent moves to ease scrutiny over clearing and trading risks. Together, these changes signal a softer regulatory stance toward the crypto sector. Still, the CFTC is cautious about the risks. The agency is asking for feedback on how 24/7 trading could affect trading, clearing and risk management. It is especially focused on areas like market integrity, customer protection and retail participation. Further, the agency also pointed to challenges in supervising a market that never closes. Comments on the proposal will be accepted until May 21. The request follows a broader trend under the Trump administration to ease oversight in commodity markets. This includes reduced scrutiny of digital assets. It also signals growing regulatory interest in modernizing financial infrastructure.

According to Wu Blockchain , on-chain data suggests that Galaxy has swapped out a considerable amount of its ETH holdings for SOL. Over the last two weeks, Galaxy has transferred 65,600 ETH – or about $105 million – to Binance and has withdrawn 752,240 SOL (approximately $98.37 million). Galaxy may have made the move because ETH continues to be in ""structural decline"" according to a recent note from Standard Chartered, which slashed its year-end target price for the asset. Data from an Arkham dashboard shows that the firm holds $87.9 million ETH versus $23.86 million SOL. Galaxy did not immediately return a request for comment from CoinDesk. Market data shows that in the last month, SOL is up 8% while ETH is down nearly 20%. Standard Chartered estimated in its note that Base has cut $50 billion from its market cap, but also argued that tokenized real-world assets could help stabilize Ethereum. Many blockchain metrics would support Standard Chartered's thesis, as transactions on Solana have rocketed past Ethereum in the last three months. A Dune dashboard shows that decentralized exchange (DEX) volume on Solana has moved past $500 billion in the last three months, while DEX volume on Ethereum is less than $400 billion. Active addresses on Solana are over 220 million while Ethereum and Ethereum Layer-2 addresses are just over 80 million. One idea, first proposed by Tron's Justin Sun , to reverse this ""structural decline"" of Ethereum has been a tax on Layer-2s. ""All collected taxes will be used to repurchase ETH and burn it in a fully decentralized manner,"" he wrote on X. This idea, however, hasn't been formalized into an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) which would be the first step in it becoming reality.

While institutional interest is surging, ETF approval doesn't ensure adoption. Experts warn that only a few ETFs will attract any major inflows, with derivative-based products likely to have the most institutional appeal. ARK Invest is already moving ahead, adding exposure to staked Solana through Canadian-listed ETFs, thanks to the increasing demand for Solana inclusion. Meanwhile, Canary Capital also recently made headlines by filing for a TRX ETF with built-in staking. SEC Faces Flood of Crypto ETF Proposals More than 70 cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are expected to undergo review by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this year, in what analysts are calling a potentially transformative moment for digital assets. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas shared that the proposed products span a broad range of holdings, from large-cap altcoins like XRP, Litecoin, and Solana to meme coins like Dogecoin, and even niche derivatives products themed around pop culture and personalities like “2x Melania.” Balchunas described the scope as “everything in between,” and also predicted a chaotic yet pivotal year ahead for crypto financial products. The wave of filings aligns with a surge in institutional interest in cryptocurrencies. A joint report by Coinbase and EY-Parthenon that was released in March revealed that more than 80% of institutions intend to boost their crypto allocations in 2025. (Source: Coinbase ) While optimism is high, analysts are still quick to point out that ETF approval alone is no guarantee of success. Balchunas compared the listing of a crypto ETF to a band getting their songs onto streaming platforms. Overall, it increases visibility but doesn’t ensure widespread traction or usage. Even with the rising enthusiasm, expectations are tempered for more obscure or speculative assets. Katalin Tischhauser , the head of research at Sygnum Bank, projected that altcoin ETFs may only attract several hundred million to a billion dollars in cumulative inflows. This is a far cry from the more than $100 billion that flowed into spot Bitcoin ETFs last year. Despite this, derivative-based products may have stronger appeal among institutions. Funds that use options or structured exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum are seen as unlocking sophisticated strategies, which could potentially trigger explosive price movements. This is according to Bitwise’s head of alpha strategies, Jeff Park . For now, 2025 is shaping up to be a critical year in the integration of crypto assets into mainstream investment vehicles. ARK Invest Adds Staked Solana to US ETFs Companies are already working to make sure their ETF offerings stand out. ARK Invest recently added exposure to staked Solana to the portfolios of two of its exchange-traded funds. This was the first time US-listed ETFs included spot SOL in their holdings. According to a client email, ARK’s Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) and Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) now hold shares of 3iQ’s Solana Staking ETF (SOLQ), which is a Canadian-listed product that invests in staked Solana. The inclusion is part of ARK’s strategy to offer investors exposure to emerging technologies, combining crypto assets like Solana with stocks from companies like Coinbase, Block, and Robinhood. ARKW holdings While the SEC has not yet approved any spot Solana ETFs, the move signals that there is growing interest in integrating Solana into institutional portfolios. In contrast, previous ETF products offering Solana exposure in the US have relied on derivatives, like those launched by Volatility Shares in March. The recent approval of Solana futures trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange further fueled speculation that a US-approved spot Solana ETF may be on the horizon. Meanwhile, Canada is still very much in the lead in this area. Just last week, 3iQ launched its Solana ETF in Canada after receiving the green light from the Ontario Securities Commission. Solana remains the second-largest smart contract blockchain by total value locked , with over $7 billion secured in its ecosystem, compared to Ethereum’s $45 billion. The SEC approved spot Ether ETFs for US trading in July of 2024, which could indicate a possible path forward for similar Solana products. Blockchains by TVL (Source: DeFiLlama ) ARK has been very active in the crypto ETF space, and even partnered with 21Shares to launch the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB). This ETF now manages close to $4 billion in assets. While the firm also collaborated with 21Shares on an Ether ETF, the partnership was dissolved shortly before the fund launched under the 21Shares brand. Canary Capital Files for First TRX ETF United States asset manager Canary Capital also recently filed for a new ETF that will hold the native token of the Tron blockchain, TRX. The proposed ETF aims to hold spot TRX while also staking a portion of the tokens to generate additional yield, according to regulatory filings . TRX currently has a market cap of over $23 billion, and staking the token provides an estimated annual yield of around 4.5%, based on data from Stakingrewards.com . TRX price action over the past year (Source: CoinMarketCap ) This filing is part of the broader wave of submissions seeking approval for ETFs focused on alternative cryptocurrencies, also known as altcoins. However, Canary’s proposal stands out for requesting staking privileges in its initial application. In contrast, US ETFs based on Ethereum typically sought staking permissions only after launching the spot asset fund and are still awaiting regulatory responses. Tron is a proof-of-stake blockchain that was developed by Justin Sun, who also owns Rainberry, the company behind BitTorrent. Sun is currently engaged in some serious legal proceedings with the SEC, which sued him in 2023 for allegedly manipulating the prices of TRX and BTT. In February, both parties agreed to pause the case for settlement discussions. Canary’s filing is part of a growing trend as US regulators have acknowledged dozens of crypto ETF proposals since early 2024, after President Trump’s return to office. These filings span a wide range of tokens, from major layer-1 networks like Solana to highly speculative meme coins. Canary itself submitted ETF proposals for a variety of tokens, including Litecoin, XRP, Hedera, Axelar, Pengu, and Sui. Despite the growing number of applications, some analysts are still very skeptical about their potential success. Crypto researcher Alex Krüger warned that most altcoin ETFs will likely fail to attract meaningful assets under management and may ultimately become a financial burden for the issuers.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|SOL|TRX,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-22 05:40:00

CFTC attorney John Murphy submitted a letter on April 21 to District Judge Valerie Caproni, asking for more time to secure approval for a deal negotiated under the Biden administration, reported Law360. “It appears unlikely that such authorization will be granted in the near term,” he said, referencing a recent statement by acting CFTC Chair Caroline Pham that the agency’s enforcement division was to deprioritize cases against crypto companies. The CFTC charged KuCoin with “multiple violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations” in March 2024. According to the Justice Department, which also filed charges against KuCoin and two founders for violating Anti-Money Laundering laws, the exchange received more than $5 billion and sent more than $4 billion in “suspicious and criminal funds.” KuCoin , trading under Mek Global Limited, reached a $297 million settlement with the Department of Justice in January and agreed to exit the US market for at least two years. In December, the CFTC and KuCoin informed the court that they reached an agreement in principle to settle the case, however terms and details of the proposed deal were not disclosed. In March, KuCoin asked the judge for a 14-day stay to address further negotiations in line with President Trump’s executive order curtailing enforcement actions against the digital asset industry. However, this request was denied, with the judge pressing for negotiation status updates. No majority at CFTC When Pham announced in February that the Commission would wind down its practice of regulation by enforcement, she also noted that terminating active cases would be more difficult to deal with. The CFTC needs a majority to dismiss a case or authorize its settlement, and there is currently no majority, with two members from each party sitting on its governing body. This could change if the Senate confirms the appointment of Trump nominee Brian Quintenz to lead the financial regulator. Both parties have requested an additional 60 days or until the Commission provides “definitive direction” on the matter. Related: US regulators FDIC and CFTC ease crypto restrictions for banks, derivatives On April 21, the CFTC’s Divisions of Market Oversight issued a request for comment to better inform them on the potential uses, benefits, and risks of perpetual contracts in derivatives markets. “Innovation and new technology have created a renaissance in markets that presents new opportunities that are accessible to more people, as well as risks,” said Pham.

This, alongside a few technical indicators, suggests an upcoming price surge for the underlying token. The metric in question is the number of active XRP addresses. Recall that it had declined significantly just a few days ago, dropping by nearly 50% within a month or so. This is a warning sign for the asset’s price as it demonstrates that users are less and less inclined to actively use the ecosystem. However, Ali Martinez outlined a massive resurgence of the number of active addresses, which skyrocketed by 67.5% on a daily scale on Sunday. This was somewhat unexpected given the relatively calm price moves during the weekend and the low trading volumes. $XRP network activity jumped 67.50%, with active addresses rising from 27,352 to 40,366! pic.twitter.com/fDiERMIYiz — Ali (@ali_charts) April 21, 2025 While the growing usage of the XRP network by more active addresses can be considered a bullish sign, so can the inverse head and shoulders pattern XRP “appears to be forming,” Martinez added. The analyst with over 135,000 followers on X believes this technical indicator can send the token flying to $2.7. Such a potential surge would represent a 30% increase from the current levels, given that XRP has retracted slightly to under $2.1 now. $XRP appears to be forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern, signaling a potential bullish breakout toward $2.70. pic.twitter.com/Wm5FW7BPgW — Ali (@ali_charts) April 21, 2025 Additionally, the squeezing Bollinger Bands indicated that XRP’s consolidation is coming to an end, which could trigger a big move in either direction.

The case, filed in August 2024 in Washington, focused on the same core issue as a suit filed in June 2023 in Florida, accusing Binance of allowing cybercriminals to use the platform for money laundering , US District Judge Barbara Rothstein said in an April 21 order. “Although the two complaints describe the proposed classes in slightly different terms, both encompass the same proposed class of individuals whose cryptocurrency was stolen and transferred to a Binance.com account during the relevant period,” Judge Rothstein said. “Therefore, this Court concludes that the classes of plaintiffs are sufficiently similar to warrant application of the first-to-file rule.” US District Judge Barbara Rothstein said transferring the Washington lawsuit to Florida was appropriate given the similarity to a case already being heard there. Source: Law360 The first-to-file rule allows a court to decline a ruling on a matter when a complaint involving the same parties and issues has already been filed in another district. Generally, the court that first hears the case usually retains jurisdiction, according to legal resource LSD Law. Plaintiffs say the lawsuits differ in key areas Lawyers acting for the plaintiffs in the Washington case argued that it differed from the Florida suit because it added other accusations not present in the Florida lawsuit and named former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao as a defendant. They also argued that transferring the case could postpone both court actions to the “detriment of all plaintiffs.” Jude Rothstein said in her ruling that it’s not apparent transferring the suit would delay resolution in either case, and would promote efficiency by “avoiding duplicative litigation,” which is one of the “first-to-file rule’s purposes.” “To allow two parallel class actions to proceed in separate districts would be duplicative and inefficient,” she said. Related: Binance to face class action after US Supreme Court denies petition for review Three crypto investors launched a suit in August 2024 against Binance and CZ in Washington, alleging their crypto was stolen and the funds were sent to Binance by the thieves to launder the funds. A year before, Michael Osterer filed his lawsuit in Florida in June 2023, alleging Binance aided the conversion of stolen crypto. A Florida court ordered the case to arbitration in July 2024.

Hold on tight, because a shocking new bill from a U.S. lawmaker could drastically alter your financial landscape. Representative Nydia Velázquez has introduced the Fair Taxation of Digital Assets in Puerto Rico Act, and it’s sending ripples of concern throughout the crypto community. Let’s dive into what this means for you and your digital assets. Understanding the Proposed Crypto Tax in Puerto Rico The heart of the matter is the Fair Taxation of Digital Assets in Puerto Rico Act. Introduced by U.S. Representative Nydia Velázquez, this bill directly targets the existing tax advantages that have made Puerto Rico a haven for crypto investors. Currently, individuals meeting certain residency requirements in Puerto Rico can benefit from significant tax exemptions, particularly on capital gains. This has attracted a wave of crypto enthusiasts and businesses to the island, boosting its economy and positioning it as a burgeoning crypto hub. However, this new legislation aims to change the game. What does the bill propose? Taxing Capital Gains: The core objective is to subject certain investors in Puerto Rico to both local and federal taxes on capital gains, specifically including gains derived from digital assets like cryptocurrencies. Targeting Specific Investors: The bill is likely designed to target individuals who have relocated to Puerto Rico primarily to take advantage of these tax benefits, rather than long-term residents. The exact criteria for ‘certain investors’ will be crucial and is currently a point of speculation and concern. Federal and Local Taxes: This isn’t just about local Puerto Rican taxes; the bill aims to ensure that these investors also pay federal taxes on their digital asset gains, effectively removing a significant layer of tax sheltering. For years, Puerto Rico has been promoted as a tax-friendly jurisdiction for investors, particularly under Act 60 (formerly Act 22 and Act 20). These acts offered substantial tax exemptions to new residents and businesses, leading to an influx of individuals from the mainland United States seeking to minimize their tax liabilities. The crypto sector was a significant beneficiary of this, with many crypto entrepreneurs and investors establishing residency in Puerto Rico. Now, this legislative move threatens to disrupt this ecosystem. Who is Nydia Velázquez and Why This Bill Matters for US Crypto Regulation? Nydia Velázquez is a highly influential member of the U.S. House of Representatives, representing New York’s 7th congressional district. Her introduction of this bill signals a growing scrutiny of crypto tax havens within the U.S. territories and potentially broader implications for US crypto regulation . Why is Velázquez focusing on Puerto Rico? Tax Fairness Concerns: The rationale behind the bill likely stems from concerns about tax fairness. Critics argue that the existing tax exemptions in Puerto Rico allow wealthy individuals to avoid paying their fair share of taxes, shifting the tax burden onto others. Economic Impact on the Mainland: There’s a perception that these tax incentives in Puerto Rico are draining tax revenue from the mainland U.S., which could be used for public services and infrastructure. Precedent Setting: This bill could be a bellwether for future US crypto regulation . If successful, it might encourage similar legislative efforts targeting other tax-advantageous locations or specific crypto tax loopholes across the United States. Velázquez’s involvement adds significant weight to this legislative effort. As a senior member of Congress, her initiatives often garner considerable attention and support. This bill is not just a minor adjustment; it’s a clear signal that lawmakers are paying close attention to how crypto wealth is being taxed (or not taxed) and are prepared to take action. Impact of the Fair Taxation of Digital Assets Act on Puerto Rico Crypto Investors The potential enactment of the Fair Taxation of Digital Assets in Puerto Rico Act has significant implications for Puerto Rico crypto investors . Let’s break down the key areas of impact: Impact Area Description Potential Consequence Increased Tax Burden Investors would be required to pay both local and federal capital gains taxes on their crypto investments. Reduced profitability of crypto investments held in Puerto Rico; diminished tax advantages that attracted investors. Investment Climate Shift Puerto Rico’s attractiveness as a crypto tax haven could diminish significantly. Potential outflow of crypto investors and businesses from Puerto Rico to other jurisdictions with favorable tax regimes. Economic Repercussions for Puerto Rico Reduced investment and economic activity in the crypto sector within Puerto Rico. Potential negative impact on Puerto Rico’s economy, which has been benefiting from the influx of crypto businesses and individuals. Compliance Complexity Investors will need to navigate a more complex tax landscape, dealing with both local and federal tax regulations. Increased administrative burden and potential compliance costs for crypto investors in Puerto Rico. For those who have made Puerto Rico their home primarily for tax optimization on their crypto holdings, this bill presents a serious challenge. The financial calculus that made Puerto Rico so appealing could be fundamentally altered, forcing investors to reconsider their residency and investment strategies. Navigating Crypto Taxes: Key Considerations for Puerto Rico Investors and Digital Asset Tax If the Fair Taxation of Digital Assets in Puerto Rico Act becomes law, Puerto Rico crypto investors will need to adapt quickly. Here are some key considerations and actionable insights: Seek Professional Tax Advice: Given the complexity of tax laws and the potential changes, consulting with a tax professional specializing in digital asset tax and international taxation is crucial. They can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances. Understand the Bill’s Specifics: Stay informed about the exact details of the bill as it progresses through the legislative process. Pay close attention to the definition of ‘certain investors’ and the specific types of digital assets that will be affected. Review Your Investment Strategy: Re-evaluate your crypto investment strategy in light of the potential tax changes. Consider the impact on your overall returns and whether Puerto Rico remains the most advantageous location for your crypto activities. Explore Alternative Jurisdictions: If tax optimization is a primary concern, research other jurisdictions that offer favorable tax treatment for digital assets. However, consider factors beyond just taxes, such as regulatory clarity, political stability, and quality of life. Engage in Advocacy: If you are concerned about the bill, consider engaging in advocacy efforts. Contact your representatives and express your views on the proposed legislation. Industry groups and crypto advocacy organizations may also be mobilizing to address this issue. The introduction of this bill underscores the evolving global landscape of digital asset tax and regulation. Crypto investors must be proactive in understanding and adapting to these changes to ensure compliance and optimize their financial outcomes. Future of Crypto and Tax Regulations in Puerto Rico The future of crypto in Puerto Rico and the broader landscape of crypto tax regulations are uncertain, but this bill signals a clear direction. It’s becoming increasingly evident that tax havens, even within U.S. territories, are facing increased scrutiny. Governments worldwide are seeking to capture tax revenue from the burgeoning crypto economy, and the days of lightly regulated or untaxed crypto gains may be numbered. Looking Ahead: Increased Regulatory Scrutiny: Expect to see continued and potentially intensified regulatory scrutiny of the crypto sector, particularly concerning taxation. Global Tax Harmonization Efforts: International organizations and governments are likely to collaborate more closely to harmonize crypto tax regulations and prevent tax evasion. Importance of Compliance: For crypto investors, compliance will become paramount. Maintaining accurate records, understanding tax obligations in relevant jurisdictions, and seeking professional advice will be essential. Evolution of Tax Strategies: Tax optimization strategies for crypto will need to evolve. Simply relocating to a low-tax jurisdiction may not be a sustainable long-term solution as regulations tighten globally. The situation in Puerto Rico serves as a critical case study. It highlights the tension between attracting investment through tax incentives and ensuring tax fairness and revenue collection. As the crypto industry matures, navigating the complexities of global tax regulations will be a key challenge for investors and businesses alike. In conclusion, the Fair Taxation of Digital Assets in Puerto Rico Act is a critical development for crypto investors. It represents a potential paradigm shift in how digital assets are taxed in Puerto Rico and possibly sets a precedent for broader US crypto regulation . Staying informed, seeking expert advice, and adapting proactively are essential steps for anyone involved in the crypto space in Puerto Rico and beyond.

According to analysis by The Kobeissi Letter, gold has reached 55 all-time highs in the past 12 months, most recently hitting a new all-time high of $3,384 per ounce. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has officially joined the rally, surpassing $87,000, positioning BTC firmly alongside gold in investor sentiment as a store of value. This parallel movement marks a rare moment in modern financial history when traditional and digital assets considered “safe havens” have climbed together. This rise comes amid increasing speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates and heightened geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Related News: BREAKING: White House Official X Account Retweets Announcement of Surprise Binance-Listed Altcoin -Price Spikes In the crypto space, gold-backed digital tokens are also seeing renewed interest. PAX Gold (PAXG) and Tether Gold (XAUT), each pegged to one ounce of gold, have seen daily trading volumes exceed $100 million multiple times in recent weeks. These tokenized assets offer investors blockchain-based gold exposure by combining the stability of the precious metal with the accessibility of crypto markets. Enmanuel Cardozo, a market analyst at Brickken, an asset tokenization platform, said that while Bitcoin’s momentum is strong, investors remain cautious. “While Bitcoin has shown resilience, I think past experience, current economic uncertainty and selling pressure in the market are still keeping investors on the sidelines and waiting for clearer entry signals,” Cardozo said. Cardozo also noted that recent institutional involvement, including from the likes of Strategy and Tether, could play a significant role in Bitcoin’s price trajectory, especially as the market responds to the traditional four-year halving cycle. “A Fed rate cut in May or June could inject more money into the system and send Bitcoin higher faster,” Cardozo added. *This is not investment advice.

U.S. Vice President JD Vance welcomed ‘positive progress’ in talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 21st. New Delhi wants to avoid American tariffs, negotiate a bilateral trade deal with Washington, and strengthen ties with the Trump administration.

According to Modi, the India-U.S. Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership will be a defining partnership of the 21st Century for a better future for both countries and the world. The two leaders also exchanged views on various regional and global issues of mutual interest and called for more dialogue and diplomacy. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on Monday that the USTR and India’s Ministry of Commerce and Industry had finalized the terms of reference to lay down ‘a roadmap’ for the discussions on bilateral trade. He added that although there was a ‘serious lack of reciprocity in the trade relationship with India’, India’s constructive engagement so far had been welcomed, and he looked forward to creating more opportunities for workers, farmers, and entrepreneurs in both countries. “I am pleased to confirm that USTR and India’s Ministry of Commerce and Industry have finalized the Terms of Reference to lay down a roadmap for the negotiations on reciprocal trade.” -Ambassador Jamieson Greer, U.S. Trade Representative According to the office of the U.S. Trade Representative, U.S. total goods trade with India was estimated at $129 billion in 2024, while India’s surplus with the U.S. reached $45.7 billion. Modi met Trump back in February, and they both agreed to more than double bilateral trade between New Delhi and Washington to $500 billion by 2030. Vance praises Modi as they launch the COMPACT initiative U.S. Vice President Vance called Prime Minister Modi a ‘great leader’ as he expressed gratitude for the warm hospitality extended to him and his family at PM Modi’s residence. He praised Modi for being ‘incredibly kind’ and shared his hopes for stronger U.S.-India relations under Trump’s leadership. The two leaders also discussed the India-U.S. COMPACT, a new initiative aimed at boosting defense, technology, and trade cooperation. The Bilateral Trade Agreement is part of the broader COMPACT program, which began in February 2025. The COMPACT (Catalyzing Opportunities for Military Partnership, Accelerated Commerce & Technology) focuses on mutual trust and citizen engagement, as both leaders describe it as a step toward a defining 21st-century partnership. However, Vance’s visit was not just political—it also carried personal and cultural significance, as per the Economic Times.

Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw received them at Delhi airport, highlighting the importance of the visit. A visit to the Taj Mahal in Agra is also part of the itinerary.

But in a fast-evolving market where timing and positioning matter most, investors are actively seeking the next high-upside play. While legacy names like Solana (SOL) and Polkadot (DOT) retain visibility, a bold new entrant— MAGACOINFINANCE —is making a serious case for exponential returns. GET 50% EXTRA BONUS – USE CODE MAGA50X – LIMITED TIME OFFER Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is on Every Radar This Quarter MAGACOINFINANCE saw immediate demand after launch, positioning it as one of the fastest-growing altcoin entries of the year. The project’s visibility continues to rise as traders evaluate the potential for early-stage breakout coins. Its limited pre-sale access is creating urgency, while its positioning ahead of other newcomers solidifies its place as a 2025 front-runner. Unlike assets that have already cycled through their most explosive phases, MAGACOINFINANCE is still in its growth window—and investors are paying close attention. How MAGACOINFINANCE Compares to the Competition Bitcoin (BTC): Dominates global market cap, but ROI potential is limited by saturation. XRP: A strong player in payments, but unlikely to deliver early-stage multipliers again. Solana (SOL): Technically powerful but nearing the ceiling of its current cycle. Polkadot (DOT): Good fundamentals, yet lagging in market engagement. Sei (SEI): A newer project, though not yet at the level of visibility or traction MAGACOINFINANCE has achieved. In contrast, MAGACOINFINANCE is positioned at the intersection of timing, scarcity, and forecasted growth—making it a standout in a crowded field. GET 50% EXTRA BONUS – USE CODE MAGA50X – LIMITED TIME OFFER The Opportunity to Get in Early Is Now With Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP anchoring confidence across the market, and projects like Solana (SOL) and Polkadot (DOT) beginning to slow, MAGACOINFINANCE is stepping forward as the coin to watch.

Trader Kevin Svenson tells his 161,100 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI) indicator on the weekly chart has confirmed a bullish breakout after last week’s candle close. The RSI is a momentum indicator that traders use to spot potential reversal points. Last week, Svenson said that confirmed weekly RSI breakouts signals “have proven to be among the most reliable macro breakout indicators.” With the breakout signal now confirmed, the trader believes that BTC is primed to witness a bullish trend shift. “The market dynamics are shifting. Demand now outpacing supply. Massive discounts are still available for the taking. One thing is certain: nothing lasts forever. This bearish trend will reverse into a bullish one. The real question is … are you ready for it?” Source: Kevin Svenson/X Zooming in on the three-day chart, Svenson says that Bitcoin’s RSI and its moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator are signaling higher prices for BTC. The MACD is a trend-following indicator that helps traders spot potential entry and exit points. Says Svenson, “Bitcoin three-day chart (RSI/MACD): Pretty decent setup here for a bullish trend pivot.” Source: Kevin Svenson/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $87,559.

The decision targets panels made by Chinese companies with factories in Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam, which are accused of undercutting domestic producers with low prices and government support. Last year, Korea’s Hanwha Qcells and Arizona‑based First Solar Inc., joined by several smaller firms, filed a complaint under the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee. They argued that Chinese‑owned factories abroad were selling cells below production cost and receiving subsidies that left U.S. makers at a disadvantage. The group said the practices threatened billions of dollars in investments in U.S. solar manufacturing. The new duties exceed those of the previous year The newly announced tariffs , unveiled on Monday, exceed the preliminary levies imposed late last year. Rates vary by company and country: products from Malaysia‑based Jinko Solar will face combined dumping and countervailing tariffs of 41.56%, while panels made by Trina Solar in Thailand are hit with a 375.19% tariff. Producers in Cambodia, who did not cooperate with the investigation, face duties of over 3,500%. “These are very strong results,” said Tim Brightbill, an attorney for the American manufacturing alliance, during a call with reporters. “We are confident that they will address the unfair trade practices of the Chinese‑owned companies in these four countries, which have been injuring the U.S. solar manufacturing industry for far too long.” Last year, Southeast Asian suppliers sent more than $10 billion worth of solar goods to the United States, making up the bulk of domestic supplies. The threat of tariffs has already reshaped global solar trade: imports from the four nations under review have fallen sharply compared with a year ago, while shipments from countries such as Laos and Indonesia are on the rise. Critics say higher tariffs could inflate costs for American assemblers Critics, including the Solar Energy Industries Association trade group, warn that higher duties on imported cells could drive up costs for American factories that assemble panels. Those facilities have grown since a clean energy manufacturing subsidy was introduced in 2022. SEIA representatives were not immediately available for comment on the finalized tariffs. The preliminary tariffs were imposed in December and were due to expire this spring, pending a final ruling by the commission. For the duties to take effect, the U.S. International Trade Commission must vote in June to confirm whether dumped and subsidized imports caused material harm to the domestic industry. If approved, the tariffs will stay in place for five years, subject to review. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

They allow traders to use leverage without actually holding the asset, making them widely used for speculation or hedging in the cryptocurrency market. According to the official filing with the CFTC, the offering includes a nano version covering 500 XRP ( XRP ) and a standard XRP futures contract representing 10,000 XRP. Both are benchmarked to the MarketVector Coinbase XRP Index and settled in U.S. dollars. While the standard version is suitable for larger institutions looking for greater liquidity, the smaller contract size is designed to accommodate smaller market participants and retail traders.

The exchange’s U.S. derivatives platform now offers over 20 cryptocurrency-based contracts in addition to traditional products linked to commodities like gold and crude oil. This launch coincides with an increase in institutional interest in XRP. Bitwise, 21Shares, and Franklin Templeton are among the asset managers who have filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch XRP-linked exchange-traded products. Coinbase’s listing could help meet that demand by offering a compliant way to gain exposure. It also arrives during a major development in the SEC’s long-running legal battle with Ripple Labs, the company behind the XRP Ledger. Earlier this month, both parties filed a joint motion to pause the case, stating they had reached an “agreement-in-principle” to settle.

But among the newest contenders, MAGACOINFINANCE is quickly emerging as the early-stage altcoin with the highest upside potential—backed by fresh momentum, growing interest, and a data-supported 57x ROI forecast. PRESALE SELLING OUT – CLICK HERE TO SECURE A SPOT NOW Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is the Talk Among Smart Money MAGACOINFINANCE saw an instant wave of interest from the market — a clear signal of rising investor confidence and early-stage demand. Today, that attention has evolved into measurable traction. Wallets are being added daily. Community growth is accelerating. And analysts tracking pre-listing behavior are now projecting based on the token’s performance indicators and similarity to prior breakout projects like Solana and Polygon . It’s rare to find a token with this level of structural setup still under the radar. The price discovery phase hasn’t begun—but the data says it’s coming. And when it does, early investors could be positioned for one of the sharpest climbs of the year. Comparing the Field: How MAGACOINFINANCE Stacks Up Against Bitcoin, Ethereum, Aptos, and Injective Bitcoin remains the macro asset of choice but is no longer expected to deliver exponential gains. Ethereum continues to dominate Layer-1 development, though much of its growth is already priced in. Aptos brings performance and promise but hasn’t yet found consistent traction in the broader retail market. Injective is a standout in decentralized trading but remains sector-limited in visibility and use case breadth. MAGACOINFINANCE , by contrast, is still early enough to offer serious upside. The excitement is not speculative hype—it’s a technical projection rooted in pre-launch engagement, token supply dynamics, and expanding wallet activity. For traders looking for high-velocity growth potential, this is one of the cleanest setups in the market.

But for investors targeting breakout ROI and early-stage growth, MAGACOINFINANCE is now leading the watchlist. With accelerating traction across every major channel, it could be the token that defines the next leg of the 2025 altcoin cycle.

The proposal to burn as many as 300 million of its 1.8 billion tokens will drop the bonded ratio from 31.47% to 25.30%. It includes a confirmed tranche of 150 million OM, or about $80 million, belonging to founder John Patrick Mullin and an additional set of tokens owned by “ecosystem partners.” Specifics were not shared in a Monday update . Mullin’s tokens are part of his team allocation that were staked when the network first started in October 2024. The burn process, which requires unstaking, will wrap up by April 29, when the tokens hit the network’s burn address. “The process of unstaking 150 million tokens from the Team and Core Contributor bucket has now begun,” the team said. The move follows the OM's brutal 90% price crash on April 13, which erased over $5 billion in market value in just hours. The Mantra team pinned the collapse on “reckless liquidations” by exchanges at the time amid speculation some investors were liquidating their positions. Mantra lets users tokenize real-world assets (RWAs) like real estate and commodities, enabling compliant digital investments in tangible assets. Its OM token facilitates transactions and governance. In January, Mantra partnered with DAMAC Group, a UAE-based conglomerate, to tokenize $1 billion in assets, including real estate, hospitality and data centers, boosting the OM token's value. OM was among the biggest market gainers in 2024, rising more than 400% on relatively low public conversation on crypto-related social media. The strength of the move intrigued traders and investors alike. The OM price is down 3.3% over the past 24 hours despite the burn announcement, indicative of a steep hit in investor confidence.",Markets|Mantra dao|burn|Staking rewards|News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|OM,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-22 07:29:05

After reaching a local high back in February, the price has since experienced a sharp drop and now appears stuck in a sideways trading range. The key resistance level remains at $0.70, a level Pi Coin has attempted to break several times with no success. If this threshold is breached, it could open the door to further gains, potentially above $0.80. However, the lack of clear market catalysts makes a breakout uncertain. Ongoing token unlocks—reportedly in the millions daily—are adding constant supply pressure, which has further dampened momentum. On April 22, 4.9M Pi Coin tokens are set to unlock. Whale Activity Sparks Interest Despite the stagnant price action, Pi Coin is seeing major whale activity. A massive $7.5 million PI, valued at $4.82 million, was just withdrawn from OKX and transferred to a private wallet. This move follows several similar transactions in recent days. In total, the whale has acquired over $48 million PI, now worth an estimated $31 million. Such high-volume accumulation often draws market attention and can be a bullish signal, especially if institutional or large private investors are positioning ahead of expected developments. Long-Term Outlook Shows Potential Looking ahead, Pi Coin still holds promise. According to projections from CoinCodex, the coin is expected to trade between $0.63 and $2.16 throughout April 2025, depending on market conditions. The forecast implies a potential return on investment (ROI) of 238.31%, driven largely by growing expectations of major exchange listings and broader adoption.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-22 07:29:44

MUTM’s pull is the revolutionary Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platform marrying Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending platforms with automated lending pools and bilateral loan agreements from peer to peer without intermediaries. This cutting-edge approach has attracted over 8400 holders and raised over $7 million in its presale phases. The token presale, under a buy-and-redistribute paradigm, ensures constant demand and price stability, and as such, is an attractive option for investors seeking utility-based assets over speculative ones. DOGE and ADA millionaires are therefore quietly accumulating MUTM, making it a potential standout in the crypto market. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Momentum with Strategic Growth Mutuum Finance is gaining momentum quickly as strong investor demand fuels the ongoing Phase 4 presale. With the token price currently set at $0.025, early adopters are investing before a anticipated 20% increase in Phase 5 to $0.03. Market anticipation is for a listing price of $0.06, providing an attractive offer for investors to reap up to 140% as the platform’s sound tokenomics and future use case materialize. Thus far, over 8,400 investors have participated, contributing over $7 million, indicating strong confidence in the platform’s new decentralized lending model and sustainable financial mechanics. Sustaining Value Through Buy-and-Distribute Innovation Among the most prominent aspects of Mutuum is the Buy-and-Distribute mechanism, which actively purchases tokens from the market and redistributes them to stakers on an ongoing basis. This strategy promotes continued demand and offers an incentive for community involvement, introducing stability in a market too often beholden to speculation and volatility. This aspect is one of the reasons behind creating long-term value and giving a stable user base. To further enhance user retention, the platform introduced a new dashboard with a top 50 holder leaderboard, where the users get bonus tokens for holding their positions. The gamified format builds community connections and encourages repeated engagement. In order to ensure the highest level of security and transparency, Mutuum Finance is undergoing a comprehensive smart contract audit with CertiK, the leading blockchain security firm. The results of the audit will be released via Mutuum’s official social media channels, reiterating the platform’s dedication to safeguarding its users and their investments. State-of-the-Art Technology with the mtToken Yield System Mutuum’s innovative mtToken technology allows users to earn passive yield by tokenizing ETH, DAI, and other assets into mtTokens that earn interest. The assets also remain always fully liquid and available, for a flexible and high-yield DeFi investment opportunity. For borrowers, Mutuum offers loans like $5,000 USDT with $7,000 in ETH collateral. The platform’s secure loan-to-collateral ratio ensures a seamless borrowing experience underpinned by transparent risk management practices. A Stable Bet in the Middle of a Volatile Market Unlike most short-term hype-based tokens, Mutuum Finance is working on creating a long-term, stable groundwork. With the close of Phase 4 of the presale, the $0.025 price point represents a final opportunity for investors before the next major price escalation. Analysts are predicting considerable growth over time as the project develops, with some speculating that MUTM will reach significantly higher levels in the future. For forward-thinking DeFi investors, Mutuum Finance offers a mix of innovation, stability, and long-term growth potential. Institutional-sized wallets and seasoned holders of DOGE and ADA are positioning early in promising, undervalued assets like Mutuum Finance. With over $7 million raised, 8,400+ holders onboarded, and a powerful utility-driven ecosystem in motion, MUTM is proving to be more than just another presale token. Get ahead of the curve, join the presale now and ride the wave of smart capital into the next generation of DeFi.

This latest purchase, amounting to approximately $556 million at an average price of $84,785 per Bitcoin, comes amid increasing market volatility, mainly characterized by BTC’s inability to surpass the $90,000 mark since early March of this year. Strategy’s Bitcoin Holdings Surge Since Saylor first championed Bitcoin as a reserve asset in 2020, the cryptocurrency has surged by approximately 987.94% from January 2020 to April 2025. This reflects the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin in the corporate world but also highlights Saylor’s foresight in recognizing its potential as a store of value. Related Reading: Dogecoin Stalls After 42 Days Of Flat Price Action — Is A Breakdown Coming? In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Saylor confirmed that Strategy’s latest acquisition of 6,556 BTC was part of a broader strategy to capitalize on Bitcoin’s growth. With a year-to-date BTC yield of 12.1% in 2025, the company’s commitment to Bitcoin is more than just an investment; it represents a strategic shift in how corporations view digital assets. As of April 20, 2025, Strategy holds its BTC at an aggregate purchase price of around $36.47 billion, with each Bitcoin acquired at approximately $67,766. MSTR Stock Soars 163% In A Year Strategy’s stock, MSTR, trading at $317.20, has seen a modest day-over-day increase of 1.78%. With a total market cap of $84.7 billion and an enterprise value of $94.5 billion, the company’s valuation continues to benefit significantly from its Bitcoin strategy. Notably, as Bitcoin prices have risen, the net asset value (NAV) of its Bitcoin holdings has climbed to $47.03 billion, reflecting a daily increase of $1.19 billion or 2.60%. Strategy’s bet on Bitcoin has also proven to be remarkably lucrative. Over the past year, MSTR stock has risen by approximately 163%, driven largely by the appreciating value of Bitcoin.

This suggests that the first investments of those who saw the potential in Strategy’s Bitcoin strategy might see a return of over 24 times their initial investment. Nevertheless, as reported by NewsBTC, an accounting rule that requires digital assets to be evaluated at market prices would cause Strategy to record an unrealized loss of $5.9 billion for the first quarter of the year. As part of its aggressive acquisition strategy, which has included nine acquisitions during this period, the business allegedly spent $7.79 billion on Bitcoin in the same quarter. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $86,900, registering a 3.3% surge in the weekly time frame.

43659077,https://timestabloid.com/?p=64688,1745307263,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple’s Done Deal: A Strategic Shift Toward Institutional XRP Utility,https://timestabloid.com/ripples-done-deal-a-strategic-shift-toward-institutional-xrp-utility/,"Prominent crypto commentator “All Things XRP” has released a detailed analysis of the recently finalized Ripple–Hidden Road acquisition , revealing substantial implications for the future of XRP. The tweet underscores the strategic importance of this $1.25 billion deal, which positions Ripple as the first cryptocurrency company to acquire a global multi-asset prime brokerage. According to the commentator, the integration of Hidden Road’s infrastructure with the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is not a symbolic step but a deliberate operational overhaul that will significantly boost XRP’s direct and indirect usage across institutional finance. Clearing Services to Drive Immediate XRP Utility The commentary asserts that clearing services are the most impactful to the XRP ecosystem among the various services Hidden Road offers. Ripple reportedly intends to migrate Hidden Road’s post-trade clearing operations, which currently process up to $3 trillion annually, onto the XRP Ledger. This shift implies that even a conservative estimate, such as 10% of these transactions being settled on-chain, would result in a substantial increase in XRPL activity. Each of these settlements would incur a transaction fee payable in XRP, thus driving up on-chain demand for the asset. Additionally, using XRP as a bridge currency in the clearing process would further enhance its liquidity and utility in cross-asset settlements. Prime Brokerage to Leverage RLUSD, Ripple’s Stablecoin Second in terms of impact, according to the analysis, is Ripple’s prime brokerage service. This layer of institutional infrastructure is expected to integrate RLUSD — Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin launched in December 2024 — as collateral across trading, lending, and custody functions. Although RLUSD is a separate token, its operation on the XRP Ledger ties its usage directly to XRP transaction volume. As institutions use RLUSD more broadly within Hidden Road’s framework, each stablecoin transaction will trigger corresponding ledger activity. This increased activity indirectly enhances demand for XRP due to its role in powering ledger operations, particularly through transaction fees and liquidity provisioning. Financing Services Remain a Long-Term Consideration Based on current information, the least impactful service in the near term is Hidden Road’s financing segment. This includes crypto-collateralized lending products that could, in theory, utilize XRP. However, the analysis notes a lack of detailed information or confirmed implementation strategies regarding how XRP would be integrated. While the potential for XRP to serve as collateral in institutional credit markets remains a long-term opportunity, it is not expected to deliver immediate benefits to the asset’s utility or visibility. The commentary characterizes this aspect as a “wild card” — a component with speculative upside but limited clarity. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Acquisition Strategy and Market Timing The analysis also explores the broader strategic motivations behind the acquisition. Ripple is responding to evolving U.S. regulatory clarity by securing institutional-grade infrastructure that could onboard traditional finance players. Hidden Road’s compliance-oriented architecture and prime brokerage services align with Ripple’s objective of scaling real-world XRP utility through regulatory legitimacy. The commentator emphasizes that this move represents not merely an expansion of Ripple’s services but the establishment of a complete institutional on-ramp into the XRP ecosystem. A Utility-Centered Milestone for XRP “All Things XRP” concludes the commentary by ranking the services in terms of their projected impact on XRP. Clearing is identified as the most significant due to its direct influence on transaction volume and liquidity. Prime brokerage follows closely, providing consistent XRP Ledger engagement through RLUSD operations. Financing, while still relevant, remains a developing aspect with future potential. The deal is framed as more than a financial headline; it is described as a foundational step toward institutionalizing XRP usage at scale. The integration of Hidden Road with Ripple is a meaningful shift that makes the XRP Ledger align with global financial infrastructure.

Web 3.0 & Blockchain is no longer a buzzword; it’s a building block. And in Dubai, the future of Web 3.0 isn’t just coming; it’s being designed at pace. As crypto regulations come of age, institutional money pouring in, and industry giants establishing regional HQs, Dubai is quickly becoming the hub of the decentralized revolution. Dubai, UAE – Tuesday, 22 April 2025 : As the city gears up to host the much-awaited Unchained Summit at the Kempinski Central Avenue on 28 th and 29 th April, a tide of excitement is rolling over the region’s Web 3.0, Blockchain, and Digital Assets industries. The summit, hosted by Aeternum, promises more than an average Web 3.0 conference. It’s a high-conviction meeting of founders, investors, policy shapers, and enterprise leaders driving the frontiers of how decentralized infrastructure will transform identity, finance, and trust in the digital world. Dubai’s Web 3.0 momentum is no longer a whisper, it’s a global signal. As the world tilts toward decentralized infrastructure, Dubai has emerged as the nexus where policy, capital, and innovation come together. With government-backed regulatory clarity, enterprise-grade adoption, and a thriving ecosystem of startups and investors, the emirate is fast becoming the capital of the decentralized ecosystem. Unchained Summit is more than a symptom of this energy; it’s the driving force. The Dubai edition brings global architects of Web 3.0 together in one place, making Dubai a living laboratory for what the internet of value, trust, and autonomy really is. From builders to billionaires, Unchained Summit’s lineup of speakers include: Ronghui Gu , Co-Founder, Certik Ella Zhang , Head, YZi Labs Kostas Chalkias , Co-Founder and Chief Cryptographer, Mysten Labs Sreeram Kannan , Founder & CEO, EigenLayer May Zabaneh , VP of Product – Blockchain, Crypto & Digital Currencies, PayPal Greg Scanlon , VP Quantitative Blockchain, Franklin Templeton Digital Assets, Franklin Templeton Keone Hon , Co-Founder, Monad Foundation Lennix Lai , Global Chief Commercial Officer, OKX Nils Andersen-Röed, Global Head of FIU, Binance, and more. “Web 3.0 is a collective movement, and Unchained Summit is where the next wave of builders and thinkers come together. We’re here to drive the conversation. Web 3.0’s growth hinges on infrastructure that can scale — it’s about throughput, cost-efficiency, and long-term sustainability. We’re proud to be at Unchained Summit, pushing the notion on sustainable blockchain designs,” said Abhijit Shukla , Founder of TAN Blockchain. Richard Ma , CEO & Founder of Quantstamp said, “I’m honored to be speaking at Unchained Summit, a premier event bringing together visionary leaders and innovators in the Web 3.0 ecosystem. At Quantstamp, we’re dedicated to securing the future of blockchain, and I look forward to sharing insights on advancing security, trust, and resilience within this rapidly evolving industry.” “Markets are moving on-chain—not just assets, but access, distribution, and users. We’re excited to be at Unchained Summit talking about what it takes to put real-world assets in the hands of real people,” said José F. Pereira , Executive Director, Own. “Web 3.0 moves fast—and the ones who show up shape where it goes. Unchained Summit brings together the doers, not just the talkers. At TBV, we’re here to back the founders turning big ideas into real traction,” said Tobias Bauer, General Partner, TBV. “Dubai is no longer just participating in Web 3.0, but it’s directing traffic,” says Sharath Kumar , Founder & CEO of Aeternum and organizer of Unchained Summit. “This is the one of the first real moments where we’re seeing decentralized technologies collide with institutional capital, national policy, and entrepreneurial energy—all in one city.” Unchained Summit’s official sponsors include: Platinum Sponsors : Mesh and Own Afterparty Sponsor : Consciousness Gold Sponsors : KoinBX , MOI Technology , and TAN Blockchain Silver Sponsors : AEON , BTSE , Mantle Network , and f(x) Protocol Bronze Sponsors : BlockchainX , Gresham International , EcoTrader , and Threshold Official Media Partner : Coin Edition With increasing interest in industries ranging from AI-driven gaming to tokenized assets, Unchained Summit indicates a wider industry transition: Web 3.0 is increasingly finding its way into mainstream enterprise planning. And as a result of this, after its Dubai edition, Unchained Summit is set to make its India debut on 5 th and 6 th December 2025, reaffirming its commitment to bridge APAC, Middle Eastern, and European Web 3.0 & Crypto ecosystems.

According to data from SoSoValue, the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $381.4 million in net inflows on April 21, over 250% higher than the previous day’s inflows and marking the highest net inflows seen since Jan. 30. Leading the charge was ARK 21Shares’ ARKB, which pulled in $116.13 million, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $87.61 million. Bitwise’s BITB and BlackRock’s IBIT attracted $45.08 million and $41.62 million, while VanEck’s HODL and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC drew in $11.72 million and $10.1 million, respectively. Grayscale’s GBTC and BTC funds also contributed to the momentum, adding $36.6 million and $32.55 million. Despite the strong recovery in Bitcoin ETFs, their Ethereum counterparts haven’t been doing well, continuing a bearish trend this week with $25.42 million in outflows. This follows eight straight weeks of losses that have totaled nearly $910 million. This wave of inflows followed last week’s reversal of a two-week outflow streak, with $15.85 million in net additions pointing to improved demand from institutional investors. The surge coincided with Trump once again criticising Powell , posting on Truth Social that his “termination can’t come fast enough” following Powell’s remarks on delaying interest rate cuts. Trump also hinted at a desire for more aggressive monetary easing, with reports suggesting his team is exploring the legal options to remove Powell. At the same time, rising U.S.-China trade tensions and persistent inflation concerns have pushed gold prices to new highs, with Bitcoin appearing to follow suit. Investors are viewing both assets as safe havens amid broader market instability. You might also like: Ark Invest: Bitcoin’s volatility is at its historical lowest. What does it indicate? U.S. markets reopened on April 21 after the Good Friday holiday, but sentiment remained negative. The S&P 500 dropped 2.4%, while the Nasdaq and Dow each fell 2.5%. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar slipped to multi-year lows against major currencies, contributing to a shift in investor preference toward alternative assets. Despite the equities downturn, crypto markets held firm over the weekend with Bitcoin ( BTC ) continuing its upward momentum on Monday, climbing past $88,500 on Tuesday while its market capitalization recovered back above $1.75 trillion for the first time since late March. Gold also surged past $3,450 an ounce during Asian trading hours on April 22, as it continued to set back-to-back all-time highs in the past couple of days as capital flowed out of stocks. Commenting on the situation, Komodo’s Chief Technology Officer, Kadan Stadelmann, told crypto.news that the inflows reflect a broader shift in investor behaviour as confidence in traditional financial systems continues to erode. “Fiat currencies lack intrinsic value, and with confidence in the U.S. financial system deteriorating, investors are turning to assets like Bitcoin,” Stadelmann said. According to Stadelmann, Trump’s push for aggressive rate cuts and threats to remove Fed Chair Jerome Powell are fuelling fears of monetary instability and accelerating the loss of trust in the dollar. “All of these factors are good for Bitcoin, which many view as one of the safe havens from the U.S. Dollar, alongside gold, other precious metals, and select crypto assets. Therefore, Bitcoin ETFs are seeing inflows. Bitcoin’s price has certainly held up considering the trade war scenario,” he added.

In a public update posted to X on April 21, the platform confirmed that its parent company, Zettai PTE Ltd, is preparing to relaunch the exchange and compensate affected users—pending approval from Singapore’s High Court. The decisive court hearing is scheduled for May 13, and if successful, WazirX plans to restart operations within 10 business days. WazirX Awaits Key May 13 Decision The July 2024 breach, reportedly carried out by North Korean hackers, targeted WazirX’s Safe Multisig wallet , leading to an abrupt suspension of both crypto and INR withdrawals. Since then, the company has worked to craft a legally binding recovery and restructuring plan to restore both platform functionality and user confidence. Zettai noted that it has already met all preliminary requirements leading up to the sanction hearing. “This hearing is essential for the Scheme to become legally effective,” the company stated, adding that they continue to respect the timeline and independence of the judicial process. Recovery Tokens and 2030 Warning Push Creditors to Approve Plan In a vote held on April 7, over 90% of WazirX’s creditors backed the proposed restructuring , which centers on the issuance of “recovery tokens.” These tokens, funded through future net profits of the exchange, are designed to eventually reimburse users with 75–80% of their pre-hack balances. It’s a bold, performance-based approach—one that only moves forward if the exchange itself returns to profitability. Zettai previously warned that without this approval, repayment timelines could stretch all the way to 2030. Fortunately for users, the strong creditor support, along with Singapore’s earlier permission to hold the vote, signals growing momentum toward WazirX’s revival. Still, not all users are satisfied with the outcome. In a separate legal twist, 54 victims had petitioned India’s Supreme Court to take action against WazirX, its co-founder Nischal Shetty, Binance, and custody partner Liminal. The plea also included a request for a financial audit of WazirX. However, Justices B.R. Gavai and Augustine Masih dismissed the case on April 16, stating that the matter fell outside the court’s jurisdiction, as it involved crypto policy—an area where regulatory clarity in India remains elusive.

Market interest has grown despite broader crypto headwinds, as investors shift focus to coins with real use cases and fairer tokenomics. PepeX has positioned itself as more than just another viral meme token—it offers a decentralised launchpad and meme-themed DEX, combining fun with functionality. The project, which launched its presale on 24 March 2025, is currently in stage 8 of a 30-stage raise. With each stage priced 5% higher than the last, the PepeX presale is designed to reward early participants, and will end once the token hits $0.085. At current rates, early investors are already up over 35%, with potential gains of up to 311% if the final target is reached before listing. A meme token launchpad with real infrastructure PepeX differentiates itself from meme coins like PEPE and Shiba Inu by offering tangible infrastructure through its launchpad, which uses AI to help creators mint new meme tokens, generate viral content, and manage community engagement. Unlike most meme coins, which depend purely on market sentiment, PepeX includes built-in anti-sniping tools, visible token distribution maps, and automated audits for projects launched on its platform. PepeX’s ecosystem includes a decentralised exchange built specifically for meme coins. It features a flat 1% trading fee and provides liquidity incentives, aiming to become the go-to DEX for meme projects launching on Ethereum. While PEPE and SHIB built their popularity on strong communities and online virality, PepeX is attempting to balance this with practical tools for project developers and meme coin traders. The presale’s structure also reflects a move toward greater fairness. Only 5% of the total token supply is reserved for the team, while 95% is made available to the public. Each stage of the sale is fully transparent, with price increases pre-programmed and visible through the official dApp. Presale shows resilience despite market volatility PepeX’s rise has coincided with a broader pullback across the cryptocurrency market, including a sharp drop in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices in mid-April. However, the presale has continued to draw participation, particularly from countries like Canada and Japan, which are showing strong engagement via multilingual platform support and growing social media buzz. In early April, the project passed the $1 million milestone, and it has since added another $500,000 in just under two weeks. As of 22 April, the dApp shows that the current token price sits around $0.027 and is increasing with every new buy. This dynamic has led to a sense of urgency among buyers hoping to secure cheaper tokens before the listing. PepeX could outlast the meme trend While meme coins are notorious for explosive short-term growth followed by steep corrections, PepeX aims to create a more sustainable model by offering value beyond hype. Its platform is designed to attract new creators who want to launch fair, secure tokens while riding the meme wave. This blend of meme appeal and decentralised infrastructure may help PepeX succeed where others have stagnated. Shiba Inu, once a leader in the meme coin space, has struggled to maintain momentum despite multiple spinoff projects. Pepe Coin, which launched purely on viral momentum, remains popular but has yet to build meaningful functionality. PepeX’s growth strategy seems to reflect a maturing meme coin investor base—one that still wants fun, but also wants substance. With a clear roadmap, ongoing presale, and a focus on fair access, PepeX could become one of the first meme projects to offer long-term utility without abandoning its viral roots.

While the promise of decentralized finance is alluring, the volatility and lack of tangible backing in most cryptocurrencies have kept many investors cautious. Enter BDTCOIN —a groundbreaking solution that merges the stability of gold with the efficiency and transparency of blockchain technology. As the world’s first gold-backed cryptocurrency, BDTCOIN offers a unique blend of trust and technology. Real Gold, Real Value What sets BDTCOIN apart is its direct link to physical gold reserves. Each BDTCOIN is backed 1:1 by actual, audited gold held securely, ensuring intrinsic value. In contrast to speculative tokens or even paper-based gold investments like ETFs, this backing acts as a built-in stabilizer. In times of inflation, market volatility, or economic downturns, BDTCOIN behaves as a hedge, providing a level of confidence that few crypto assets can claim. For investors seeking a store of value that’s inflation-resistant, gold has always been the go-to. BDTCOIN enhances that proposition by making gold not just storable, but instantly transferable, divisible, and usable in the digital economy. Blockchain Infrastructure That Delivers While gold gives BDTCOIN its tangible worth, blockchain gives it wings. The platform runs on a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network, enabling real-time transactions without intermediaries. Gone are the days of depending on banks or brokers for settlement—BDTCOIN empowers users to transact globally, securely, and cost-efficiently. BDTCOIN’s blockchain is built with future-ready encryption and quantum-resistant protocols, ensuring that its infrastructure remains secure even as cyber threats evolve. A Security-First Approach In the cryptocurrency world, trust is earned through transparency and robust protection. BDTCOIN doesn’t stop at standard encryption. It employs multi-signature wallets, secure private key management, real-time fraud detection, and zero-knowledge proofs to guarantee security at every level. Additionally, user privacy is sacrosanct. BDTCOIN’s anonymous wallet addresses and encrypted channels allow for confidential transactions without compromising on transparency, making it a powerful tool for both retail users and institutional investors concerned about data integrity. Accessible, Portable, and Truly Global Traditional gold comes with baggage—literally. It’s bulky, hard to transport, and often out of reach for small investors. BDTCOIN digitizes gold ownership, removing all these barriers. All one needs is a smartphone and an internet connection to buy, hold, or transfer gold-backed assets. This borderless access opens up new financial possibilities for users in emerging markets or those outside traditional banking systems. Whether you’re in São Paulo or Singapore, BDTCOIN brings the power of gold to your fingertips, with near-zero fees and zero paperwork. More Than Just an Investment Tool Beyond personal finance, BDTCOIN is designed for real-world application across sectors. For individuals, it’s a private, secure way to store and transfer wealth. For businesses, it enables quicker cross-border payments and supply chain settlements. Governments and NGOs can use BDTCOIN for transparent fund distribution, budget management, and real-time auditability of grants or aid. The Best of Both Worlds Perhaps BDTCOIN’s most compelling feature is its dual growth potential. Since it’s tied to gold, it benefits from the long-term appreciation of a trusted commodity. Simultaneously, it stands to gain from the explosive growth in blockchain adoption. This hybrid positioning makes BDTCOIN a rare asset—one that balances safety and upside. Investors can enjoy portfolio diversification, instant liquidity, and the peace of mind that comes from holding an asset with both historical significance and technological edge. Now Trading on MEXC and LBank For those ready to experience the future of gold investment, BDTCOIN is now officially listed and available for trading on MEXC and LBank —two of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges.

These behind-the-scenes players keep the wheels of crypto turning by ensuring there’s enough liquidity for trades to be executed smoothly. When operating optimally, market makers assume a neutral role, serving as referees overseeing an eternal game that pits buyers on one side against sellers on the other. In a market as wild as crypto, that’s no small feat. Without them, you’d see bid-ask spreads widen and prices lurch unpredictably. While the fortunes of the leading market makers rise and fall, just like crypto itself, the following players have been in the game for years, working tirelessly to keep the industry liquid. DWF Labs DWF Labs has been on the scene since 2018 and is now a household name for projects operating in web3. They’ve made waves with their investment arm, but market-making is still where they shine brightest. DWF is hooked up with over 60 top exchanges and manages liquidity for more than 700 projects. You’ll be hard pressed to find a busier crypto market maker. DWF Labs blends high-frequency trading with efficient algorithms to keep the order books humming, giving new tokens a fighting chance at gaining market share. When your project’s gearing up for its token generation event, DWF’s the one you call to make sure it’s a success. A token’s early days are make-or-break since without solid liquidity, it’s dead in the water. The DWF team supports buy-sell action that feels natural, not forced, helping projects build momentum. It also helps that with their OTC desk and ties to heavyweights like Fireblocks, DWF Labs aren’t just tossing liquidity around but are directing it with precision. For web3 startups that are in it for the long haul, DWF Labs is that wise older sibling who’s got your back. Wintermute Wintermute’s been doing its thing since 2017, and in 2025 they’re as vital as ever. Based out of London, they’re prized for their AI-powered algorithms that keep over 350 trading pairs liquid across centralized and decentralized platforms. But where they flex is DeFi. While some market makers stick to the predictable world of centralized exchanges, Wintermute dives headfirst into decentralized protocols, making sure the long tail of tokens have the liquidity they need to thrive. The Wintermute team knows how to keep spreads tight and liquidity flowing, even when the market’s throwing a tantrum. Admittedly, they’re geared toward bigger players and DeFi projects with some oomph, but that focus lets them shine where it counts. In 2025, as DeFi keeps growing, Wintermute’s out there proving that liquidity doesn’t have to be a centralized game: thanks to their efforts, it’s also thriving onchain. Amber Group Amber Group boasts more than 2,000 institutional clients and has supported more than $1 trillion in trade volume – a quite staggering figure. It accounts for around $5B of daily volume through its market making services, which means that more than 1 in 20 trades executed globally is supported by Amber. As you’d expect of a market maker of this size, Amber has a finger in many pies – or rather a bag on many exchanges, both centralized and decentralized.Its market making service doesn’t operate in isolation, incidentally: it’s complemented by an advisory service that’s every bit as vital. This is where it has an opportunity to draw upon its expertise and guide fledgling projects through the token issuance process. As a result, projects can expect to receive a bespoke strategy that’s tailored to their needs rather than a one-size-fits-all formula that fails to take into account the peculiarities of their particular project and token design. Cumberland Cumberland , part of the DRW Trading family, is the grown-up in the room. Since dipping into crypto in 2014, the Chicago-based outfit has been a rock for institutional players looking for serious liquidity. In 2025, they’re still a top dog, offering bespoke market-making services for everything from Bitcoin to the more exotic altcoins that are on the up. Cumberland’s meat and drink is OTC trades and big-block deals, serving up liquidity for hedge funds, exchanges, and token projects that need to move serious size without rocking the boat. A no-nonsense approach to risk management has enabled Cumberland to avoid the sort of slip-ups that have tainted the reputation of less experienced market makers. What makes Cumberland stand out is how calm they are under pressure. They’ve got the infrastructure to handle wild market swings and keep the order books steady. They’re certainly not flashy, but that’s the point: they’re reliable. For a token project trying to land on a tier-one exchange or a fund wanting to swap millions without slippage, Cumberland’s the steady hand you want. In a year where institutions are piling into crypto harder than ever, they’re the quiet force making it all work. Pick Your Market Maker Wisely If you’re shopping around for a market maker – and if you’re launching a token that’s a virtual certainty – it’s essential to pick the right provider. Don’t select a market maker purely on account of their size, reach, or reputation. All of these qualities matter, of course, but what’s more important is finding one that will take the time to understand your needs and then develop a solution that aligns with your needs and budget.Where will your token be trading initially – DEX or CEX? – and how long do you anticipate requiring market making services for? Will it be an initial burst to provide initial liquidity or is it something you anticipate needing on an ongoing basis? All of the market makers profiled here excel at what they do. Take the time to dive deeper into their core service, and if desired, speak to one or two of their clients to see whether they’d recommend them. Then you can reach out directly to your preferred market maker and start the conversation about what they can do for your token. Pick the right market maker and you’ll have a partner for life.

The announcement, made through the country’s official DART disclosure platform, revealed the restructuring will take effect on July 31, 2025. Meanwhile, XRP, the most traded token in South Korea, is down 2% against the won in the last 24 hours. According to the exchange’s translated statement , Bithumb plans to extend its business divisions ahead of a planned initial public offering (IPO), which the company is preparing to execute in Q3 2025. The split will revive a previously delayed initiative in which Bithumb proposed ring-fencing its core exchange operations from other ventures. Operations split to create ‘Bithumb A’ Per the disclosure, the spun-off company will temporarily operate under the name “Bithumb A,” though the exchange has not yet disclosed its official English title. It will create separate accountability for each line of business under Bithumb’s umbrella. “ By establishing independent accountability for each business division, the spin-off fundamentally prevents risks originating from non-exchange businesses from spreading to the exchange business ,” Bithumb stated in the filing. The exchange added that the decision is expected to maximize corporate efficiency and sharpen the competitiveness of its various divisions. The distribution ratio of shares post-spin-off will be split approximately 56% for the current Bithumb structure and 44% for Bithumb A. In its filing, Bithumb outlined that the division plan is subject to change, depending on multiple factors, including the financial health of the split company, strategic revisions, or feedback from regulatory agencies and third parties. “ Should the general meeting of shareholders approve the current spin-off plan, several types of amendments may be implemented without requiring further shareholder approval ,” the company stated. The changes include updates to business activities, those prompted by laws or accounting standards, and modifications deemed necessary without causing material disadvantage to shareholders. Bithumb recorded a net profit of $110 million in 2024, a 560% uptick compared to the previous year. Despite these gains, Bithumb trailed behind Upbit, South Korea’s largest digital asset exchange, which posted approximately $671 million in net profits for the same period. According to reports from local financial news outlets, the company has tapped Samsung Securities to serve as the lead underwriter for its debut on the South Korean stock exchange. The exchange has also previously mentioned it could pursue a dual listing on the Nasdaq, though details remain unconfirmed. XRP falls 2% on Bithumb post-announcement About a day after Bithumb’s restructuring announcement, XRP, the cryptocurrency tied to Ripple Labs, saw a modest decline of around 2.03% on the exchange. The token hasn’t quite retraced its steps to the highs it clocked in the South Korean market late 2024, and has suffered a 15% loss in the last month. According to price updates from Bithumb, XRP has shed over 3% of its value against the South Korean currency year-to-date, but is still 278.8% higher than its 12-month lows. On global markets, at the time of this publication, XRP was trading at approximately $2.08. The digital asset has posted a 294% increase, but is currently in a consolidation phase. Analysts suggest the current price level is being held up by a support zone around $2.07, with resistance clustered between $2.20 and $2.23. Stolyarov adds, “ Would start having more optimism, say higher than $2.17, breaking some technical levels and lines. It will most probably be an X wave before some next consolidation pattern, and there is nothing to cheer about ,” he concluded. XRP trading chart with price projections. Source: TradingView Looking at the daily chart, XRP’s pattern suggests there could be a potential breakout toward $3.40 by the end of May, with further upside projected to reach as high as $3.70 by July if momentum holds.

According to Lookonchain's post, Galaxy Digital transferred 65,600 ETH (about $105 million) to Binance in the last two weeks, while withdrawing 752,240 SOL (about $98.37 million) from the exchange. While this points to Galaxy Digital making a possible ETH-SOL swap, Standard Chartered analyzed the reasoning behind Galaxy making this move in a recent note. Standard Chartered noted that ETH’s continued structural decline could be the reason why Galaxy Digital purchased Solana instead of ETH. As is known, Standard Chartered lowered its year-end target price for Ethereum. Standard Chartered estimated that Base has lost $50 billion in market value, while also noting that tokenized real-world assets could help stabilize Ethereum. While Galaxy Digital is selling its ETH holdings, Tron (TRX) founder Justin Sun continues to hold onto his ETH holdings. Sun recently denied the allegations that he sold ETH. Market data shows that SOL has increased by 8% in the past month, while ETH has decreased by around 20%. *This is not investment advice.

In what can be termed as a seismic shift, global banking giants like Deutsche Bank and Standard Chartered are now planning to expand their presence in the U.S, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report. Although the details are still unclear, the latest interest comes as traditional finance slowly shifts back toward crypto, especially after the collapse of FTX and the shutdown of key crypto-friendly banks. The rising client demands, new revenue opportunities, regulatory clarity and the banks’ urge to stay competitive in the ever evolving market could be driving this new interest. Major Banks Seek Licenses With Trump’s promise to make the U.S. “the crypto capital of the planet,” these banks seem more ready than ever to dive into the crypto world. The recent bills in Congress aim to regulate stablecoins requiring the issuers to secure banking licenses or charters. While some crypto firms are pursuing full banking licenses, while others want limited approvals just to issue stablecoins. Several crypto firms including BitGo, Circle, Coinbase and Paxos are planning to apply for Bank Charters or licenses as they plan to expand their operations in the US. Currently, Anchorage Digital is the only crypto company in the US with a federal Bank Charter. However, it has spent millions of dollars to comply with the regulatory requirements and is currently under investigation. A recent Barron’s report reveals that the US Department of Homeland Security’s El Dorado Task Force has launched an investigation into Anchorage possibly over money laundering or financial crime concerns. Former employees have also been contacted as part of the probe. However, Anchorage has denied the claims saying that the report is just based on mere speculations. Bank of America is also ready to issue its own stablecoin once there is legal clarity. Similarly, U.S. Bancorp has resumed its crypto custody services in partnership with NYDIG. However, while KeyCorp CEO Chris Gorman recognizes the opportunity, he has decided to wait and evaluate to see how the space develops with the regulatory challenges.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-22 08:07:42

Will Ethereum continue to decline below $1,600?",https://crypto.news/eth-btc-ratio-hits-5-year-low-will-ethereum-continue-to-decline-below-1600/,"Ethereum is quickly losing ground to Bitcoin, with the ETH/BTC ratio falling to its lowest level in five years. According to CoinGecko data , the ETH/BTC ratio now stands at 0.01787, a level not seen since January 2020. The sharp decline reflects Ethereum’s ( ETH ) ongoing underperformance relative to Bitcoin ( BTC ). Over the last 24 hours, the ratio dropped nearly 5%. It’s down 24% in the past month and has fallen 67% over the last year. This divergence has caught the attention of investors. In the last year, Bitcoin has risen by about 34%, while Ethereum has lost 50% of its value. The market appears to be favoring Bitcoin’s position as a store of value, while Ethereum is having difficulty retaining investor interest. Despite recent advancements such as the Dencun upgrade, Ethereum’s key metrics have been falling. Network fees have dropped to multi-year lows, decentralized finance activity has declined, and faster chains like Solana ( SOL ) and BNB Chain ( BNB ) are attracting new liquidity at Ethereum’s expense.

The Ethereum mainnet has experienced decreased activity and fee income as more users switch to layer-2s like Base and Arbitrum ( ARB ). Although layer-2s promotes scalability, they have had a short-term negative effect on ETH’s price action. The absence of fresh catalysts and regulatory uncertainty have also affected sentiment. From a technical perspective, ETH is trading at $1,587 as of press time. The relative strength index is hovering just over 40, leaning more towards the neutral territory. If bulls can reclaim the 20-day moving average near $1,618 and break past $1,650, short-term momentum may shift bullish. Ethereum price analysis. Credit: crypto.news A decisive move above $1,700 would open the door to a rally toward $1,850. On the downside, failure to stay above the $1,550 support may lead to a drop toward $1,440.

He ensured that “the U.S. is the best and most secure place in the world to invest and do business.” With over 70 cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) awaiting approval, Atkins’s leadership will be closely scrutinized by the crypto industry. Crypto ETFs Await Decision Under Atkins The SEC is currently reviewing 72 crypto-related ETFs, covering a broad spectrum of assets from XRP, Litecoin, and Solana, to Dogecoin, Penguins, and novelty tokens like 2x Melania. Despite the influx of altcoin and meme coin ETFs expected to hit the market this year, Bitcoin ETFs continue to dominate, holding 90% of global crypto fund assets. According to Bloomberg ETF specialist Eric Balchunas , while altcoin ETFs will certainly see some attention, Bitcoin is likely to retain 80-85% of the market share in the long term, proving its enduring dominance in the crypto ETF space. As institutional interest grows, with 80% of firms planning to increase crypto allocations by 2025, analysts caution that approval doesn’t guarantee success. Balchunas compared ETF approval to music streaming: “Your song might be on Spotify, but it doesn’t guarantee listeners.” XRP and Solana Lead ETF Filings XRP leads the list of crypto assets with the most ETF filings, including Bitwise’s early application and a more recent one from Franklin Templeton. Solana (SOL) has also gained traction, with successful ETF filings recently. Meme coin ETFs, including Grayscale’s Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF and 21Shares’ Polkadot (DOT) ETF, are also under review, adding to the growing list of products. VanEck, a prominent global investment management firm, received SEC approval for its new “ Onchain Economy ETF ”, which will hold 30-60 stocks tied to the crypto sector, including mining companies, exchanges, data centers, and traditional finance entities. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP ETF News: Why Hasn’t BlackRock Filed it Yet? , ARK Invest has added staked Solana to two of its ETFs, marking the first time U.S. investors can gain direct exposure to SOL through an ETF.

Final Thoughts The crypto community now waits to see whether Atkins’s SEC will approve these ETFs, as some of the underlying assets remain volatile. Will the new chair take a more cautious approach, or will he lead the charge for broader crypto market integration?

The winds of the digital currency market are shifting, and a significant indicator is flashing: we’re in Bitcoin Season . The CoinMarketCap (CMC) Altcoin Season Index , a closely watched gauge of market sentiment, has registered a low score of 16. This reading, holding steady from the previous day at 00:28 UTC on April 22nd, firmly plants us in territory where Bitcoin reigns supreme. But what exactly does this mean for you, and the broader crypto landscape? Let’s dive deep into understanding this crucial market indicator. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: What’s the Buzz? So, what is this Altcoin Season Index everyone’s talking about? Think of it as a crypto weather vane, but instead of predicting rain, it forecasts market dominance – either for Bitcoin or for alternative cryptocurrencies, better known as altcoins. This index, meticulously tracked by CoinMarketCap, offers a snapshot of the crypto market’s current allegiances. It’s a tool designed to help you understand whether Bitcoin is leading the charge or if altcoins are stealing the spotlight. Understanding this dynamic is crucial for navigating the volatile waters of the crypto market. Here’s the breakdown of how the index works: Scope: The index analyzes the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap. Importantly, it excludes stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like wBTC, renBTC) to focus purely on the performance of native cryptocurrencies. Timeframe: It assesses performance over the past 90 days. This 90-day window provides a meaningful trend analysis, smoothing out short-term market fluctuations and highlighting more sustained shifts in momentum. The Core Comparison: The index pits these top 100 altcoins against Bitcoin. It’s a direct comparison of returns: have altcoins outperformed Bitcoin, or has Bitcoin taken the lead? The 75% Threshold: This is the magic number. For the market to be officially declared in ‘Altcoin Season’, a significant majority – at least 75% – of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Bitcoin Season Trigger: Conversely, when 75% or more of these altcoins have underperformed Bitcoin, or put another way, 25% or fewer have outperformed Bitcoin, we enter ‘Bitcoin Season’. This is the scenario we’re currently in, as indicated by the index reading of 16. Index Score Range: The Altcoin Season Index score ranges from 1 to 100. A score closer to 100 would signify a strong Altcoin Season, while a score closer to 1 points towards a dominant Bitcoin Season. In essence, the lower the index, the stronger the Bitcoin dominance . A score of 16 is quite low, reinforcing the current market sentiment that Bitcoin is leading the pack. Why are We in Bitcoin Season? Unpacking the Dynamics With the Altcoin Season Index signaling a clear Bitcoin Season , the burning question is: why? What market forces are at play that are causing Bitcoin to outperform the vast majority of altcoins? Several factors could be contributing to this shift in market dynamics: Flight to Safety: In times of market uncertainty or perceived risk, investors often flock to Bitcoin. As the oldest and most established cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is often seen as a ‘safe haven’ within the crypto space. When traditional markets show volatility or when regulatory clouds gather over the crypto industry, Bitcoin tends to benefit from this ‘flight to safety’. Institutional Adoption: Institutional investors are increasingly entering the crypto market, and their primary focus, at least initially, tends to be Bitcoin. Large institutions are more comfortable investing in Bitcoin due to its longer track record, greater liquidity, and established infrastructure. This institutional demand can drive up Bitcoin’s price relative to altcoins. ETF Anticipation and Flows: The approval and launch of Bitcoin ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) in various markets have been a game-changer. These ETFs provide a more accessible and regulated way for institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. The continuous inflow of funds into these ETFs further strengthens Bitcoin’s market position. Narrative Strength: Bitcoin often benefits from powerful narratives, such as its role as ‘digital gold’, a hedge against inflation, or a store of value. These narratives resonate strongly with investors, especially during times of economic uncertainty. Altcoins, while often boasting innovative technologies, sometimes struggle to build and maintain equally compelling and widely understood narratives. Altcoin Correction: After periods of significant altcoin rallies (mini ‘alt seasons’ within a larger Bitcoin-dominated market), corrections are natural. Profits taken from altcoins may flow back into Bitcoin, further enhancing its dominance. It’s important to note that these factors often interplay and reinforce each other. For example, positive news around Bitcoin ETFs can strengthen the ‘digital gold’ narrative, attracting more institutional investment and further solidifying Bitcoin dominance . Navigating Bitcoin Season: Strategies and Considerations for Crypto Investors So, you’re a crypto investor, and the Altcoin Season Index is telling you it’s Bitcoin Season . What should you do? Here are some strategies and considerations to keep in mind: Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: Assess your current crypto portfolio allocation. If you are heavily weighted towards altcoins, consider whether it’s prudent to rebalance, perhaps increasing your Bitcoin holdings during this period of dominance. This isn’t about abandoning altcoins entirely, but about strategically managing risk and opportunity in the current market environment. Focus on Bitcoin Fundamentals: Use this Bitcoin Season to deepen your understanding of Bitcoin’s fundamentals. Research its technology, its network effects, its security, and its long-term value proposition. A solid understanding of Bitcoin’s core strengths can provide conviction during periods of market volatility. Selective Altcoin Strategy: While it’s Bitcoin Season , not all altcoins are created equal. Focus on fundamentally strong altcoins with solid use cases, active development teams, and growing adoption. Research projects that are building real-world solutions and demonstrating resilience, even during a Bitcoin-dominant phase. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) into Bitcoin: Consider implementing a dollar-cost averaging strategy for Bitcoin. This involves investing a fixed amount of money into Bitcoin at regular intervals (e.g., weekly or monthly), regardless of the price. DCA can help smooth out volatility and potentially improve your average entry price over time. Stay Informed and Adaptable: The crypto market is dynamic. Continuously monitor the Altcoin Season Index and other market indicators. Stay updated on news and developments that could impact market sentiment and potentially signal a shift back towards Altcoin Season. Adaptability is key in the crypto space. Table: Bitcoin Season vs. Altcoin Season – Key Differences Feature Bitcoin Season Altcoin Season Market Dominance Bitcoin Altcoins Altcoin Season Index Score Low (e.g., 1-25) High (e.g., 75-100) Investor Sentiment Risk-off, flight to safety (Bitcoin) Risk-on, appetite for higher-risk altcoins Price Action Bitcoin outperforms altcoins Altcoins outperform Bitcoin Common Market Drivers Market uncertainty, institutional Bitcoin adoption, ETF flows Increased risk appetite, new altcoin narratives, broader crypto market rallies Is Altcoin Season Over Forever? Looking Ahead While the current Altcoin Season Index points towards a strong Bitcoin Season , it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is cyclical. Market dominance ebbs and flows between Bitcoin and altcoins. Bitcoin dominance periods are often followed by altcoin rallies, and vice versa. It’s unlikely that Altcoin Season is ‘over forever’. Several factors could potentially trigger a shift back towards Altcoin Season in the future: Broader Crypto Market Rally: A significant influx of new capital into the crypto market as a whole could lift all boats, including altcoins. Emergence of New Altcoin Narratives: Breakthroughs in altcoin technologies, the rise of new sectors like DeFi or NFTs, or the emergence of compelling new use cases could drive renewed interest and investment in altcoins. Bitcoin Consolidation: After a period of strong Bitcoin dominance , Bitcoin’s price may consolidate, allowing capital to rotate into altcoins seeking higher percentage gains. Increased Retail Participation in Altcoins: As the crypto market matures, retail investors may become more comfortable exploring and investing in a wider range of altcoins beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Therefore, understanding the Altcoin Season Index isn’t just about reacting to the current market conditions. It’s about recognizing market cycles, anticipating potential shifts, and positioning your portfolio for both Bitcoin Season and the eventual return of Altcoin Season. It’s a continuous dance of market dynamics. Powerful Insights: Actionable Takeaways for Crypto Success The Altcoin Season Index , currently at a reading of 16, is a powerful indicator confirming that we are firmly in Bitcoin Season . This signifies a period where Bitcoin dominance prevails, and altcoins are generally underperforming relative to the market leader. However, this isn’t a static state. The crypto market is characterized by cycles, and understanding these cycles is key to navigating its inherent volatility and capitalizing on opportunities. Here are some key actionable insights to take away: Acknowledge Bitcoin Season: Recognize the current market phase and adjust your investment strategy accordingly. Don’t fight the trend. Strategic Portfolio Allocation: Consider rebalancing your portfolio to reflect the current Bitcoin dominance , potentially increasing Bitcoin exposure. Focus on Quality: Whether it’s Bitcoin or altcoins, prioritize fundamentally strong assets with solid long-term potential. Stay Informed and Agile: Continuously monitor market indicators, adapt to changing conditions, and be prepared to adjust your strategy as the market evolves. By understanding and utilizing tools like the Altcoin Season Index , you can gain a deeper insight into the rhythm of the crypto market, make more informed investment decisions, and navigate both Bitcoin Season and Altcoin Season with greater confidence. The crypto market is ever-evolving, and knowledge is your most valuable asset.

After nearly nine months of inactivity, WazirX could finally resume services if Singapore’s High Court approves its restructuring plan, the company said in an April 21 update to X. The proposal, submitted by parent company Zettai PTE Ltd, outlines how the exchange plans to recover from the $234 million hack it suffered last July. If approved at the May 13 sanction hearing, Zettai says trading and withdrawals could resume within 10 business days, kicking off a phased recovery process. “This hearing is essential for the Scheme to become legally effective,” WazirX said, noting that it has “completed all prior required steps,” reiterating that it remains on track for a relaunch within the previously communicated April–May 2025 window. You might also like: More than 90% of creditors back proposed restructuring, WazirX says The July 2024 hack, attributed to North Korea’s Lazarus Group , forced WazirX to pause all crypto and fiat withdrawals after attackers drained funds from a Safe Multisig wallet. Since then, the exchange has been working on a court-backed plan to return assets to users and relaunch its platform. Under the proposed scheme, affected users would receive recovery tokens, redeemable over time through the platform’s profits, expected to cover 75% to 80% of account balances at the time of the hack. Full repayment could take up to 36 months, depending on the exchange’s performance. However, the plan didn’t land well with all users at first. When WazirX unveiled the scheme in February, it was met with strong criticism for tying repayments to the success of a new decentralised exchange. Users accused the team of offering an “unfair” deal, especially after WazirX warned that rejecting the plan could result in a five-year delay in compensation. Despite the initial pushback, the plan gained traction in March. More than 90% of creditors, representing over $195 million in approved claims, voted in favour of the restructuring during a 10-day window hosted on the Kroll Issuer Services platform. While the recovery plan moved forward, 54 users tried to take legal action against WazirX in India’s Supreme Court. However, the case was dismissed on April 16, with the court stating it was not the right forum to deal with crypto-related disputes. Read more: ‘Is this even real?

Legal experts, including Bill Morgan, criticized the move as unjustified and out of touch, citing past rulings. Another Attack on XRP Ripple has the habit of making the headlines, but sometimes, the news surrounding it is not what its proponents want to see. Most recently, the company’s cross-border token was included in a lawsuit that the Oregon Attorney General (AG) filed against the US-based crypto exchange Coinbase. The chief legal officer of the state claims XRP, SOL, ADA, LINK, UNI, and many more were offered and sold as investment contracts on the platform. The lawsuit refers to them as “crypto securities.” The attack from the Oregon AG raised some eyebrows across the community. Bill Morgan – the prominent legal commentator known for his in-depth analysis of Ripple’s legal battles – was among those criticizing the action. He said the chief legal officer of the state of Oregon ignored the fact that Coinbase delisted XRP from its platform in December 2020 after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple. The exchange re-enabled trading with the asset in the summer of 2023 following a court ruling that the secondary sale of XRP didn’t constitute an offer of investment contracts. “No one could have the imagination to make up this dystopian nonsense,” he added. It is important to note that Coinbase faced similar problems from the SEC in the past. Nearly two years ago, the agency filed a 101-page lawsuit against the exchange, accusing it of violating securities laws by making certain cryptocurrencies that supposedly passed the Howey Test available for trade on its platform. Some of the large-cap altcoins labeled as securities in the case included SOL, ADA, and MATIC, while XRP was not mentioned . The SEC drastically changed its hostile approach toward the crypto industry in the past several months , ending its legal disputes with numerous digital asset entities. The case against Coinbase is among the dismissed ones, but perhaps the most popular one (against Ripple) is still awaiting its official resolution. Latest Updates on the Ripple v. SEC Front Last month, Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, announced a major win, revealing that the SEC would withdraw its latest appeal, signaling the effective conclusion of the lawsuit. The company’s chief legal officer – Stuart Alderoty – later confirmed this development. The Ripple community was quick to celebrate this as the end of the case that had been dragging on for over four years. However, the battle needs to undergo additional legal proceedings before becoming part of history. Earlier this month, Ripple and the SEC filed a joint motion to request a pause on their individual appeals. Shortly after, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit acknowledged and granted the submission. Although this brings the case closer to a formal resolution, the securities regulator has yet to make an official statement. Meanwhile, attorney James Filan noted that the agency has been ordered to submit a status report on its legal proceedings within 60 days of that ruling. It may seem like the lawsuit’s end is just a matter of time, but analysts have warned that its eventual resolution is unlikely to impact XRP as it has already been priced in.

Pal tells his 1.1 million followers on the social media platform X that the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential Indicator is flashing bullish for the layer-1 platform Sui ( SUI ). Traders use the TD Sequential Indicator to predict potential trend reversals for tokens based on the closing prices of their previous nine or 13 bars or candles. He also suggests that SUI is on the verge of breaking out of a downward channel, a bearish pattern indicating that the asset is forming lower highs and lower lows. “Sui: knock, knocking, knocking on heaven’s door.” Source: Raoul Pal/X Other analysts are also suggesting SUI may be gearing up for an explosive move. Pseudonymous trader Cheds says if SUI can break through its immediate resistance, it may start printing significant rallies. “$2.50 overhead is a long trigger.” Meanwhile, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 783,900 followers on the social media platform X that Sui is gaining adoption as a decentralized finance (DeFi) network, including for Bitcoin ( BTC ) staking and lending, referred to as Bitcoin DeFi (BTCfi). He also suggests SUI is bouncing off a key support level on the three-day chart. “Once the markets are turning back into an uptrend, the money will flow back into the ones that have shown strength. SUI is one of them. It’s a great spot to investigate SUI: BTCFi is quickly growing fast as 10% of TVL (Total Value Locked) going through SUI. DeFi on SUI is in the top six of all chains. Nearly $6 billion in trading volume on DeFi in the past month. I think it can do really well in the upcoming cycle.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Lastly, the financial giant VanEck predicted SUI will soar more than 358% from its current value. “We believe the crypto bull market will persist through 2025, reaching its first peak in the first quarter. At the cycle’s apex, we project Bitcoin to be valued at around $180,000, with Ethereum (ETH) trading above $6,000. Other prominent projects, such as Solana and Sui, could exceed $500 and $10, respectively.” SUI is trading for $2.18 at time of writing, up 4% in the last 24 hours.

Indeed, U.S. stocks erased $1.5 trillion from their cumulative market capitalization during the day, with all major indices ending the session in the red. The S&P 500, for example, fell 2.38% from 5,282.70 points to 5,158.20 points, and the Nasdaq 100 dropped 2.46% from 18,258 to 17,808. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 one-day charts.

Total cryptocurrency market cap one-week chart. Source: TradingView Though multiple altcoins recorded a rally within the 24-hour time frame, and a part of the overall rise can be attributed to the strong performance of major meme coins such as Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ) and Dogecoin ( DOGE ), the majority of the rise is owed to Bitcoin ( BTC ). The world’s premier cryptocurrency seemingly broke with its previous tendencies that saw it plunge as low as $75,000 on stock market headwinds as BTC rose 1.16% in the last 24 hours and is, at press time, changing hands at $88,524. BTC one-week price chart. Source: Finbold Why U.S. stocks crashed on April 21 The market dynamic can primarily be linked to the prevailing macroeconomic uncertainty arising from the escalating trade war. Although there was much optimism surrounding the reciprocal tariff pause – evidenced by the rally on the false rumor that it would be implemented and by the official announcement a handful of days later – the situation has only deteriorated since. Not only has the Trump administration yet to unveil the results of its claimed negotiations with various countries, but Japan has already signaled that there are concessions it would not make, and China has continuously been increasing pressure with a series of proclamations and measures . As the major U.S. companies are overwhelmingly reliant on global supply chains and international markets, the causes for the stock market bloodbath are rather self-evident. Similarly, the Trump administration’s tempestuous approach to policy, whether it be the surprise tariffs or calling Fed Chair Jerome Powell mean names when he does not do what the president wants, has ensured a drop in confidence in the American dollar and, thus, a sharp decline in the USD Index. Why gold and crypto are showing resilience On the flipside, cryptocurrencies are not under pressure from the same factors – though could still suffer vicariously should traders be left with too little disposable income to invest – and gold, as a traditional safe haven, has been growing increasingly attractive.

43661769,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/best-crypto-to-buy-now-with-circle-set-to-enter-the-payments-industry,1745313408,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/43661769.jpeg,Best Crypto to Buy Now With Circle Set to Enter the Payments Industry,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/best-crypto-to-buy-now-with-circle-set-to-enter-the-payments-industry,"For far too long, discussions around crypto’s utility and their adoption into real-world uses have been active with not much success. But attention is often commanded when major players announce integrations that could be used in real life—the latest being one from Circle, the stablecoin which has claimed that they will be launching a new payments and remittance network soon. This would mark a serious win for blockchain tech and the crypto industry as a whole, as it would mean cross-border transactions powered by blockchain technology, avoiding the clunky and conventional methods for many. Launch Event Aimed at Finance-Based Companies and USDC Strategic Partners This isn’t just a product reveal—it’s a statement of intent. Circle’s decision to host its payments network launch from the 87th floor of One World Trade Center, with a guest list filled with banks, remittance firms, and USDC partners, signals that this isn’t about crypto-native users anymore—it’s about winning over the traditional financial world. When legacy institutions are the audience, it suggests the technology is no longer in a testing phase—it’s ready for enterprise deployment. The decision to present directly to payment service providers and fintech companies shows Circle’s awareness that mass adoption won’t come from retail investors—it will be driven by infrastructure partners who move billions daily. This is how stablecoins like USDC become embedded into the backend of financial ecosystems, silently powering remittances and transactions without retail users even realizing crypto is involved. More importantly, the timing is precise. Global regulations around stablecoins are starting to take shape, giving firms like Circle a rare window to establish trust and market dominance before tighter competition sets in. A payments-focused product aligned with compliance from day one is exactly what financial institutions have been waiting for. For investors, that’s the kind of institutional signaling that matters. When traditional finance begins to actively engage with crypto-based networks—and not as an experiment, but as a viable upgrade to their outdated rails—it’s often a sign that the sector is about to mature in a way that retail alone can’t drive. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Utility Projects With High Potential SUBBD Circle’s upcoming payment network is a reminder that crypto’s path forward will depend on projects that serve real people with real needs. In the creator economy, SUBBD is doing exactly that. This isn’t just another token with a vague pitch—it’s building a full-featured ecosystem where creators can directly monetize content, host subscriber experiences, and even build tokenized communities without depending on ad-driven platforms or revenue cuts. The appeal here is structural. Every piece of content, every subscription, every tip—it’s all tied to a decentralized payment mechanism. That kind of reliability and transparency is what has held back the creator space for years. With Circle ushering in an era of blockchain-powered transactions for global businesses, projects like SUBBD are proving the same value can be brought to smaller, creator-led economies. Creators like ClayBro have also highlighted its utility and potential in his featured videos on YouTube—another reason to look at it as a potential investment for many. And unlike passive tokens that sit idle in wallets, SUBBD’s utility is active by design. The token fuels everything on the platform—access, rewards, governance, and circulation. It’s not waiting for adoption. It is the adoption. As the spotlight shifts toward stable, function-first platforms, SUBBD’s design gives it long-term viability that mirrors where the entire space seems to be heading. Fantasy Pepe Circle is targeting the institutions—Fortune 500s, payment processors, and major banks. Fantasy Pepe , on the other hand, is focused on something just as influential: engagement. It’s a platform where artificial intelligence meets prediction-based gameplay, letting users jump into quickfire fantasy football rounds that resolve in seconds rather than seasons. This format trims all the noise. No spreadsheets, no long tournaments—just short, AI-generated simulations where players choose their side, place a forecast, and see the outcome unfold instantly. Every match is powered by real algorithmic models and recorded on-chain, providing transparency most games can’t replicate. Fantasy Pepe isn’t pushing for novelty—it’s focused on practicality. Users can participate without barriers, understand the rules without guides, and earn without waiting. That kind of ease and accessibility is what real-world adoption looks like—whether you’re a crypto veteran or stepping into the space for the first time. As Circle focuses on solving inefficiencies in international payments, Fantasy Pepe addresses the friction points in decentralized gaming. It’s nimble, functional, and forward-facing. And it’s making utility enjoyable, not just useful. Solaxy What Circle is building for cross-border payments, Solaxy is enabling on a protocol level. While the announcement from Circle zeroes in on smoother money movement across borders, Solaxy is focused on the conditions that make that even possible—speed, affordability, and infrastructure that doesn’t crumble under congestion. Solaxy functions as a Layer 2 built to streamline activity across both Solana and Ethereum. Its design favors agility—minimizing gas fees, speeding up confirmation times, and keeping the door open for future scaling. This is less about promising a new universe and more about making existing systems function at the level users deserve. The platform’s staking system isn’t just an incentive tool—it’s part of the architecture. Stakers contribute to performance and gain consistent rewards, allowing for participation without relying on hype cycles or hollow marketing. With new regulatory frameworks taking shape and stablecoins becoming essential tools rather than outliers, Solaxy stands to benefit from the increasing demand for performance-first infrastructure. It doesn’t aim to be flashy—it aims to be necessary. In a sector now valuing efficiency as much as innovation, that might be one of the strongest positions to hold. Best Wallet Token With its presale, Best Wallet isn’t trying to reinvent crypto—it’s making it easier to use. That may sound simple, but it’s a gap many projects still haven’t filled. From managing assets across 60+ chains to tracking presale opportunities and staking options in one dashboard, Best Wallet is structured around utility that actually gets used. It offers access to a quality DEX offering, portfolio tracking tools, and market insights without requiring users to jump between platforms or rely on third-party services. That consolidation is exactly what many crypto users have been waiting for—one clean interface that replaces six scattered tabs. The BEST token acts as the key to unlocking deeper access within the ecosystem. Early holders are eligible for airdrops, staking rewards, and presale allocations that often remain off-limits to the average investor. That built-in incentive structure ties token value directly to platform activity, giving it a practical function rather than just speculative worth. Over $11M Raised & Counting! 💎The Best Wallet ecosystem keeps growing, and early holders are locking in their spot. 🚀Now is your chance to secure exclusive rewards and be part of the next-gen crypto wallet.Don't miss out! 👉 https://t.co/eMjBsXbv1H pic.twitter.com/p3E6BvxnDS — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) March 14, 2025 The proejct’s features have impressed many, which has helped it raise more than $11.7 million already. As a service, the project promises to offer convenience without compromise—one of the toughest balances to achieve in crypto. With each update, the platform continues to push toward becoming an everyday hub for both new and seasoned investors. The tools are there, the user experience is sharp, and the token utility is baked into everything—not as a gimmick, but as a foundation. Conclusion As major players begin formalizing blockchain’s role in global finance, the spotlight inevitably shifts to projects offering purpose-built utility rather than speculative flash. Circle’s foray into enterprise payments is a clear marker of where capital and attention are headed—toward infrastructure, integration, and scalable solutions. The initiatives mentioned above align with what the market increasingly values: accessible platforms, clear use cases, and systems built for real engagement. For investors evaluating where value might consolidate next, these could represent timely entries into sectors moving from potential to performance.

Talks with the European Union have hit several dead ends, particularly over the US tariffs on steel and aluminum and the refusal of the EU to open its agricultural markets. France and Germany have voiced frustration over what they describe as “aggressive” US tactics. In South America, Brazil has cautiously entered negotiations. Canada and Mexico are pushing back against new tariff threats. Canadian officials described the latest round of talks as “strained.” In Asia, the response has been mixed. South Korea has shown more flexibility and recently agreed to modest agricultural concessions in exchange for the easing of auto tariffs. On the other hand, China is in a tariff war with the United States. Japan, while willing to cooperate with America, will not sacrifice its interests to make peace. Ishiba prioritizes national interests In a parliamentary session on April 21, Ishiba, Japan’s prime minister stated, “If Japan concedes everything, we won’t be able to secure our national interest.” Ishiba said this in relation to the ongoing trade negotiations between Japan and the United States following the imposition of a 25% tariff on imported vehicles, including those from Japan. The tariff has been in effect since April 3, and the US government also placed additional duties on auto parts, which are set to take effect in May. In recent discussions, Ishiba has voiced serious concerns over the inconsistency between the 2019 bilateral trade agreement and the new automobile tariffs imposed by the US. The 2019 agreement includes verbal assurances from the then-President, who also happened to be Trump, that Japan would be exempt from national security tariffs on car imports. “We will continue to convey our stance (to the US) from this standpoint,” Ishiba said, although he said Japan has no plan to terminate the 2019 agreement altogether. Japan’s top trade officials, including its trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa and its Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato, are scheduled to visit Washington for discussions about trade barriers and currency exchange rates. The yen’s recent decline to a seven-month low of 140.615 yen has raised concern that the US could pressure Japan to stabilize the currency and reduce the US trade deficit.​ Japan’s domestic priorities are non-negotiable While Japan is open to compromise during the discussions, Ishiba has made it clear that certain areas important to Japan’s national interest will be protected. One of these areas is agriculture. The US has criticized Japan’s high tariffs on agricultural imports, such as rice, and regards them as unfair trade barriers. Ishiba is defending his country’s position by insisting that those measures are essential for protecting Japanese agriculture and ensuring consumer safety. That’s not to say Japan is not exploring other possible areas for compromise. For example, there are reports that Japan may consider increasing imports of US rice and soybeans or relaxing safety standards for imported cars to advance the tariff talks. Japan’s financial contributions to US military bases have also been mentioned during trade discussions. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Atkins, who previously served as agency’s commissioner from 2002 to 2008, now steps back into the regulatory spotlight with a clear mission: to foster capital formation, safeguard investor interests, and enhance market efficiency. A New Chapter at the SEC “I am honored by the trust and confidence President Trump and the Senate have placed in me to lead the SEC,” said Atkins in a statement. “Together we will work to ensure that the U.S. is the best and most secure place in the world to invest and do business.” His appointment has been welcomed by many in the digital assets community, particularly as expectations rise for a more crypto-friendly approach than that taken under Gary Gensler’s tenure during the Biden administration. Notably, Atkins’ confirmation process faced delays due to extensive financial disclosures, including up to $6 million in crypto-related investments, such as stakes in Anchorage Digital and Securitize. Crypto Enforcement Eases Under New Leadership Atkins takes over from acting chair Mark Uyeda, who, earlier this year, launched a Crypto Task Force to bridge the gap between the SEC and blockchain innovators. Since then, the Commission has quietly dismissed several high-profile crypto enforcement actions, including those against Coinbase, Consensys, Gemini, and Uniswap—decisions that have fueled optimism about a potential regulatory reset. Meanwhile, the SEC is facing a flood of applications for crypto ETFs , with Bloomberg reporting that over 70 such applications are currently under review. These range from ETFs tied to major digital assets like XRP and Solana to more unconventional offerings, including meme coins and experimental tokens. “Everything from XRP, Litecoin and Solana to Penguins, Doge and 2x Melania and everything in between,” noted Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas on X. His colleague, James Seyffart, described the surge as a “spaghetti cannon approach,” where issuers are throwing a wide variety of products at the wall to see what sticks under Atkins’ leadership. As the industry watches closely, 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for crypto regulation in the United States—and Paul Atkins is now at the helm.

On April 22, NFT data tracker CryptoSlam showed that Polygon NFTs overtook Ethereum, reaching a $22.3 million volume in the past week. This represented 24% of last week’s overall NFT sales volume, which reached $92.9 million. The network also had over 39,000 NFT buyers for the week, an 81% increase over the previous week. Ethereum remained second in sales, with a $19.2 million NFT sales volume for the week. Mythos Chain followed with $14.3 million, while Bitcoin-based collections ranked fourth with $14.1 million for the week. Top blockchains by seven-day NFT sales volume. Source: CryptoSlam RWA NFT collection drives Polygon surge The Polygon NFT surge was driven by a single real-world asset (RWA) NFT collection, highlighting that the RWA narrative has reached the NFT space. RWA tokenization refers to tangible assets minted on the blockchain to increase accessibility and trading opportunities for the assets. Simply put, it’s transforming real-world assets like art, property or even stocks into digital tokens on a blockchain that can be bought, held or traded. CryptoSlam data shows that increased sales from Courtyard NFTs caused the Polygon NFT surge. The collection reached a sales volume of $20.7 million, eclipsing the performances of other popular NFT projects for the week. Courtyard NFT collection tops digital collectible sales volume list. Source: CryptoSlam Related: Bybit shuts down four more Web3 services after axing NFT marketplace Courtyard is an RWA marketplace for graded physical card collections. This includes the Pokémon, basketball and baseball cards that are popular among collectors. The platform operates by storing and insuring tokenized cards in a vault operated by a security company. This means that NFTs are physically backed. After purchasing NFTs, users can opt to redeem the physical card. When this happens, the NFT is burned and will no longer be traded in the marketplace. Onchain RWAs have been a strong narrative in the first quarter of 2025. Data from RWA.xyz shows that tokenized assets have reached $21.2 billion, with total asset holders of more than 97,000. This excludes the value of stablecoins, which is already at $227 billion.

However, meme tokens remain in the spotlight due to their diverging performances. Whales appear split on Official Trump, with Meteora purchasing the dip as Binance dumps. Meanwhile, the presale project CartelFi experiences robust investor interest, with $1,055,108 raised. Source – CartelFi.com Let’s explore the themed crypto sector and what to anticipate in the near term. TRUMP Coin drama: Meteora dip buys as Binance quits Official Trump displays bullishness after gaining over 1.5% in the previous 24 hours to trade at $8.45. Chart by Coinmarketcap While the 40% surge in daily volume signals renewed trader interest, the alt’s near-term actions remain uncertain amid a tug-of-war by whales. Leading entities Binance and Meteora, each boasting a substantial amount of Trump tokens, have showcased opposing stands. Data from Arkham shows Meteora saw a negative $1.84 million in TRUMP’s exchange netflows. That confirmed a significant accumulation, bringing its TRUMP balance to $121 million. Such events underscore trust in the meme asset’s performance in the upcoming sessions. However, further details reveal an opposing move from Binance. The leading exchange recorded $2.04 million in positive TRUMP netflow, suggesting sell-offs. Nevertheless, Binance remains the second-largest TRUMP holder, with tokens worth around $227 million. Surprisingly, retail players on Binance remain bullish, confirmed by the soaring open interest and funding rates. TRUMP’s Open Interest on Binance increased to $95.42 million as Funding Rates reached 5.1%. That signals bullishness among traders as they anticipate upward price moves. Indeed, TRUMP trades at a crucial juncture, ready for a move in either direction. The alt’s liquidation heatmap indicates liquidity above and below the current price, presenting mixed signals. Nevertheless, the daily chart offers a clearer picture. The latest rally saw TRUMP breaking out of a descending channel, suggesting continued gains. However, overcoming the $8.729 resistance remains essential to solidify TRUMP’s momentum. Such a move could trigger surges toward the supply region at $10.707 – $12.365. Magnified bull action at this range could catalyze solid rallies to $17 before exploding to $24. CartelFi thrives on magnified investor interest While most cryptocurrencies contemplate decisive directions, the cartel-themed yield farming project CartelFi stood out. The protocol witnessed massive interest during its ICO, raising more than $1 million from savvy investors. CartelFi has attracted investors as it aims to address a key challenge within the meme crypto space. Its meme-centric staking and liquidity pools turn idle meme tokens into money-generating tools, unlocking and unleashing massive capital into the decentralized finance (DeFi) world. The Whitepaper reads: With tens of billions in meme coin market cap currently sitting dormant in wallets, CartelFi activates this capital, turning idle speculation into active accumulation through the first-ever yield system built specifically for meme assets. Moreover, CartelFi distinguishes itself from standard DeFi networks with its deflationary mechanisms. The project uses fees to burn CARTFI coins, translating to continued earnings 24/7. The altcoin trades at $0.0352 per token – a lucrative discount as it targets 1,000x growth after its official launch. You can learn more about CartelFi via their website .

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is turning heads with bold predictions of a $5 target before September, an explosive 19,900% upside. The project has reached Phase 4 of its presale surpasses $7 million in funding, backed by more than 8,400 investors. Currently priced at $0.025, the token, MUTM will enjoy a 20% increase in the next Phase 5, reaching $0.03. As Ripple XRP holds firm as a cornerstone of crypto infrastructure, Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming the wild card that could redefine the next leg of the bull market. XRP Steadies at $2.08, Gearing Up for Its Highly Anticipated Breakout Ripple’s XRP has been quietly rebuilding, holding strong at $2.08 as it gears up for a pivotal breakout above the $3 mark. XRP’s cross-border payment use case and recent institutional interest have rebooted its bullish narrative despite past regulatory hangovers. Analysts point to its consolidation strength above the $2 level as a sign of pressure mounting, with previous patterns suggesting an explosive move is imminent. While XRP continues to consolidate on its base established, newer participants like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are attracting eyeballs with more vibrant growth forecasts. Mutuum Finance: Rising Star of DeFi Innovation Mutuum Finance is soon going to become a trendsetter in the field of decentralized finance (DeFi) with its path-breaking double-lending platform. By bringing Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models in an innovative manner uniquely, the platform has already caught a lot of attention. Already, over 8,400 investors have put in presale more than $7 million, depicting the very high confidence and appeal of the project. With the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) token price of $0.025 during Phase 4, there should be a 20% appreciation in price as the platform is in Phase 5, with an early opportunity for meaningful profit taking prior to reaching the projected market listing price of $0.06. Boosting User Activity via Leaderboards and Incentives In a bid to enhance user engagement even more and intensify loyalty, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has introduced an engaging new dashboard with a leaderboard of the top 50 token holders in real time. The top investors shall receive special bonus tokens, which shall encourage them to maintain their positions and engage with the platform in the long term. The gamified aspect strengthens both community engagement and retention. The Power of Bi-Lending: P2C and P2P Synergy The innovation at the heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its hybrid lending model. The P2C (Peer-to-Contract) layer allows users to earn passive income by lending USDT to liquidity pools controlled by smart contracts. By contrast, the P2P (Peer-to-Peer) layer removes intermediaries, allowing users to lend and borrow directly, giving them more privacy and control. By combining these two systems, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) achieves perfect balance between decentralization, security, and efficiency and therefore is highly attractive to both conservative and aggressive DeFi investors. While XRP eyes a steady climb toward $3, Mutuum Finance is sprinting toward an audacious $5 target by September, representing a potential 19,900% upside from its current $0.025 valuation. With over $7 million raised and 8,400+ investors already on board, Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming the high-risk, high-reward contender fueling the next DeFi narrative. This is a presale and a breakout in motion. Lock in your position before Phase 5 launches and the window to early exponential gains starts to close.

43662281,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=151388,1745314217,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unicoin’s Defiant Stand: Bravely Rejects SEC Settlement in Crypto Fraud Fight,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/unicoin-sec-fight-fraud-charges/,"In a shocking turn of events in the crypto world, investment firm Unicoin has decided to reject a settlement offer from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Instead of settling, Unicoin is gearing up for a full-blown legal showdown, choosing to fight the fraud charges in court. This bold move, first reported by Decrypt, signals a potentially landmark case that could have significant repercussions for crypto regulation and how the SEC approaches enforcement in the digital asset space. Are we witnessing a pivotal moment in the ongoing saga between crypto innovators and regulatory bodies? Let’s dive into the details of this unfolding Unicoin SEC Fight . Why is Unicoin Choosing to Engage in a Crypto Legal Battle ? Unicoin’s CEO, Alex Konanykhin, minced no words in expressing the company’s stance. He declared Unicoin’s determination to hold the SEC accountable, labeling the charges as an “unjust persecution” against a crypto firm they claim is highly compliant. This isn’t just a simple disagreement; it’s a declaration of war, legally speaking. But what exactly led to this dramatic escalation? SEC Charges: The SEC has slapped Unicoin with serious allegations, including fraud and the unregistered offering and sale of securities. These are not minor infractions; they strike at the heart of securities law. Settlement Rejection: While the specifics of the SEC’s settlement offer remain undisclosed, Unicoin’s outright rejection suggests it was either deemed too punitive or fundamentally unacceptable to the company’s leadership. Principle of Compliance: Konanykhin’s assertion that Unicoin is “one of the most compliant crypto firms in the U.S.” is a key element of their defense strategy. They are essentially arguing that the SEC’s actions are unwarranted and based on a misunderstanding or misapplication of regulations. This decision to reject the settlement and enter a Crypto Legal Battle highlights a growing trend in the crypto industry: a willingness to challenge regulatory overreach. Companies are increasingly pushing back against what they perceive as overly aggressive enforcement actions, especially in a regulatory landscape that is still evolving and often lacks clear guidelines for digital assets. What are the Potential Implications of this SEC Settlement Rejection ? Unicoin’s decision to fight has ripple effects that extend far beyond just their company. It sets a precedent and raises crucial questions about the future of crypto regulation and enforcement. Let’s consider the potential implications: Potential Implication Description Legal Precedent: This case could establish important legal precedents regarding how securities laws are applied to crypto assets and the extent of the SEC’s regulatory authority in this space. Increased Litigation: Unicoin’s defiance might embolden other crypto firms facing SEC scrutiny to also opt for litigation rather than settlement, potentially leading to a surge in legal battles. Regulatory Clarity (or Further Confusion?): Depending on the court’s ruling, the case could either bring more clarity to the regulatory framework for crypto or further muddy the waters if the legal outcome is ambiguous or contested. Market Confidence: The unfolding legal drama could impact market sentiment. A victory for Unicoin might be seen as a win for crypto innovation and decentralization, while an SEC victory could reinforce regulatory control and potentially dampen enthusiasm. The SEC Settlement Rejection is not just a company-specific event; it’s a potential inflection point for the entire crypto industry. The outcome of this legal battle will be closely watched by investors, regulators, and crypto enthusiasts alike. Delving Deeper into the Crypto Fraud Charges At the heart of this dispute are the Crypto Fraud Charges leveled against Unicoin by the SEC. While the specific details of the alleged fraud haven’t been extensively publicized in this initial report, understanding the nature of these charges is crucial. Generally, crypto fraud can encompass a range of activities, including: Misleading Investors: Providing false or incomplete information to investors about the company, its technology, or the potential returns on investment. Pump-and-Dump Schemes: Artificially inflating the price of a cryptocurrency and then selling off holdings at a profit, leaving other investors with losses. Unregistered Securities Offerings: Selling digital assets that are deemed securities without registering them with the SEC, thus bypassing investor protection regulations. Ponzi or Pyramid Schemes: Operating unsustainable investment schemes that rely on attracting new investors to pay off earlier investors, rather than generating actual profits. The SEC’s charges against Unicoin likely fall into one or more of these categories. Unicoin, on the other hand, is vehemently denying these allegations, claiming they operate with integrity and compliance. The upcoming litigation will be crucial in revealing the specifics of the SEC’s evidence and Unicoin’s defense against these serious Crypto Fraud Charges . What Does the Future Hold for the Unicoin Litigation ? The Unicoin Litigation is now set to be a protracted and potentially expensive affair. Both sides are digging in for a legal battle that could take months, if not years, to resolve. Here’s what we can expect and what to watch out for: Discovery Phase: Both sides will engage in extensive discovery, gathering evidence, documents, and testimonies. This process itself can be lengthy and revealing. Court Hearings and Filings: There will be numerous court hearings, motions, and filings as the case progresses. These will offer insights into the legal arguments and strategies of both the SEC and Unicoin. Potential for Settlement (Unlikely but Possible): While Unicoin has rejected the initial settlement, the possibility of a negotiated settlement down the line, perhaps under different terms, cannot be entirely ruled out, especially as the legal costs mount. Trial (If No Settlement): If no settlement is reached, the case will proceed to trial. This would be a high-stakes showdown with significant public attention and potentially dramatic revelations. Impact on Unicoin’s Operations: The ongoing litigation will undoubtedly cast a shadow over Unicoin’s operations and reputation, regardless of the final outcome. The Unicoin Litigation is more than just a legal dispute; it’s a test case for the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation and a challenge to the agency’s authority by a crypto firm determined to defend its name and operations. The crypto community will be watching closely to see how this drama unfolds. Actionable Insights and Takeaways from the Unicoin SEC Fight For crypto investors, entrepreneurs, and anyone interested in the regulatory landscape, the Unicoin SEC Fight offers several key takeaways: Regulatory Scrutiny is Real: The SEC is serious about regulating the crypto space and is willing to take aggressive enforcement actions against firms it believes are in violation of securities laws. Compliance is Paramount: Unicoin claims compliance, but the SEC charges suggest otherwise. This highlights the critical importance of rigorous legal and regulatory compliance for all crypto businesses. Legal Battles are Costly and Risky: While Unicoin is choosing to fight, litigation is expensive, time-consuming, and the outcome is uncertain. Settlement, even if undesirable, is often the more pragmatic choice for many firms. Transparency and Disclosure are Key: The allegations of Crypto Fraud Charges underscore the importance of transparency and full disclosure to investors. Crypto firms must prioritize clear and honest communication. Evolving Regulatory Landscape: The Unicoin SEC Fight is a reminder that crypto regulation is still evolving. Firms must stay informed, adapt to changing rules, and engage proactively with regulators. In conclusion, Unicoin’s audacious decision to reject the SEC settlement and engage in a Unicoin SEC Fight is a bold move that could redefine the contours of crypto regulation. Whether it’s a strategic gamble or a principled stand, the outcome of this Crypto Legal Battle will undoubtedly have lasting implications for the crypto industry. It’s a saga of defiance, regulation, and the ongoing quest to define the boundaries of innovation in the digital age.

However, as price struggles to hold the $1,600 level as support, the cryptocurrency risks losing recent momentum. Related Reading: Ethereum Enters Historic Buy Zone As Price Dips Below Key Level – Insights Ethereum Breakout Eyes Key Resistance On Easter Sunday, the crypto market saw a positive end-of-week after jumping 4.2%. Bitcoin (BTC) closed the week above the $85,000 barrier for the first time this month, while Ethereum surged 5.4% to attempt to reclaim the $1,600 resistance for the third time in the past seven days. ETH closed the week around the $1,640 mark before climbing to $1,658 during Monday’s early hours. Amid this performance, the cryptocurrency attempted to break out of its multi-month downtrend for the first time. Crypto analyst Ted Pillows highlighted that Ethereum broke out of its descending resistance on Monday morning. According to the post, the cryptocurrency has been in a downtrend in the one-day chart since early February, retesting the trendline thrice over the past few months, but always being rejected. Its latest rejection from the descending resistance sent the cryptocurrency below the $1,700 mark, which fueled the bearish sentiment brewing toward ETH. The start-of-April retraces, driven by the ongoing tariff war between the US and China, further sent Ethereum to lower levels, hitting its two-year low below $1,400 and retesting the 2018 highs. The analyst noted that ETH could rally toward $2,000 during April’s last leg if the cryptocurrency holds the $1,600 support, which it hasn’t been able to do for most of the month. Is The ETH Bottom Close? Analyst Carl Runefelt also highlighted ETH’s downtrend breakout, affirming that it “might go absolutely parabolic starting from here.” According to Runefelt, the resistance breakout eyes the $3,000 mark, which was lost during the February retraces. However, Ethereum has lost its short-term momentum, retracing its 24-hour gains in the past few hours. Its price dropped below the $1,600 mark into the key $1,500 support level, trading around the $1,570-$1,580 price range. This retracement could hint that ETH’s recovery failed to gain strength, risking a drop to the current level’s lows. However, a bounce from this zone to hold the $1,650 mark could confirm the breakout and propel the cryptocurrency’s price toward $1,700-$1,800 resistance. Analyst Ali Martinez considers that ETH’s new rally won’t start again until it breaks through the $2,330 supply wall, where over 12.6 million addresses purchased around 68-63 million ETH. Related Reading: XRP Wyckoff Pattern Maps Bullish Run To $3.70 This Summer Meanwhile, another market watcher suggested that Ethereum’s trading pair against Bitcoin is “the only chart to look at right now.” Crypto Fella affirmed that the bottom of the ETH/BTC chart is close, as it has reached its lowest level since 2020. Per the chart, the last time ETH/BTC dropped below the 0.022 mark, it hovered between the 0.016-0.022 zone for some months before bouncing toward its late-2021 high. As of this writing, Ethereum trades at $1,571, a 1% decline in the daily timeframe.

Now, he believes the worst may be behind us, and a global economic reshuffle is laying the groundwork for a long-term rally . According to Zulauf, the S&P 500 has already bottomed near 4,835 , just shy of his projected 5,000 level. He anticipates a brief retest in May , potentially dipping as low as 4,500 , before a sustained recovery takes hold. If recession is avoided, the index could climb steadily from mid-2025, with a bullish target of 7,500 by late 2026 or early 2027 —a gain of over 50% from current levels. Zulauf’s confidence is based on several unfolding factors: Global pessimism has peaked , with Bank of America’s fund manager survey reporting the most bearish sentiment in 25 years . Treasury yields have spiked (10-year at 4.6%+ ), reflecting structural changes in capital flows, not just Fed policy. Foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries remain massive at $7.2 trillion , making the U.S. vulnerable to bond market shocks during geopolitical stress. The U.S. dollar index (DXY), once at 110 , is now expected to dip below 98 in the coming weeks, signaling a multi-year decline . Zulauf stresses that 2025 is a transition year where investors must stay tactical. “Sharp pullbacks should be used to buy into long-term positions,” he says. ""When your gut tells you to sell, that’s usually the time to start buying."" Looking ahead, he sees a global rebalancing of capital and economic influence . The U.S. won’t dominate investment returns as it has in recent years due to unsustainable deficits and geopolitical pushback. He expects foreign markets to outperform , led by European equities (especially Germany, as it begins massive defense and infrastructure spending) and Asian stocks—despite geopolitical risks. In terms of sectors, Zulauf is: Bearish on long-duration bonds , seeing 10-year Treasury yields breaking 5% by 2026–27 . Bullish on commodities , especially crude oil , which he sees hitting $150–$200 by 2027 after bottoming near $60 . Long-term bullish on gold , with a projected peak near $3,400 before a temporary correction to $2,600–$2,700 . Despite Western hesitation, global central banks are aggressively accumulating gold as trust in the U.S. dollar wanes. He warns that AI hype is fading , and the mega-cap tech ""Magnificent 7"" stocks are unlikely to lead the next leg of the bull market. Instead, investors should look for U.S.-based industrials , companies with minimal international tax arbitrage, and resilient business models aligned with domestic growth and trade realignment. While risks remain—especially a potential global recession in late 2025 —Zulauf concludes that the worst is likely priced in. “By fall 2025 , investors should be fully invested,” he advises. “The setup is there for a strong 18- to 24-month bull run that will reward those who stayed patient during this volatile transition.”",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-04-22 09:36:14

43662564,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=151385,1745314820,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Soaring Confidence: US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Witness Massive $381M Inflow Surge,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-etf-inflows-soar/,"Exciting news for crypto enthusiasts and investors! The U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs market is buzzing with activity. On April 21st, these investment vehicles experienced a significant surge, pulling in a combined net inflow of a whopping $381.89 million. This robust influx signals growing institutional and retail investor appetite for Bitcoin exposure through regulated and accessible ETF products. Let’s dive into the details of this impressive Bitcoin ETF inflows event and what it could mean for the future of crypto investment. What Sparked the Recent Bitcoin ETF Inflows? While pinpointing the exact cause of market movements is always complex, several factors likely contributed to this substantial inflow into spot Bitcoin ETFs : Renewed Market Optimism: The crypto market has shown resilience and signs of recovery recently, potentially boosting investor confidence in Bitcoin and related investment products. Institutional Adoption: Increased institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs suggests growing acceptance of crypto as a legitimate asset class within traditional finance. These large players often make significant investment decisions, leading to substantial inflows. Ease of Access: Crypto ETF investment offers a straightforward and regulated way for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the digital asset. This accessibility appeals to a broader range of investors, including those less comfortable with the technical aspects of cryptocurrency storage and security. Positive Market Sentiment: Overall positive sentiment surrounding Bitcoin, fueled by anticipation of future price appreciation and potential regulatory clarity, may be driving investors to allocate capital to Bitcoin ETFs. Breaking Down the Bitcoin ETF Inflow Numbers: Who Led the Charge? The April 21st data, reported by Trader T (@thepfund) on X, provides a fascinating snapshot of individual ETF performance. Here’s a breakdown of the top performers in this Bitcoin ETF news : ETF Provider ETF Ticker Net Inflow (USD Million) ARK Invest ARKB $116.13 Fidelity FBTC $87.61 Bitwise BITB $45.08 BlackRock IBIT $42.10 Grayscale GBTC $36.60 Grayscale BTC $32.55 VanEck HODL $11.72 Franklin Templeton EZBC $10.10 As you can see, ARK Invest’s ARKB ETF took the top spot with a significant $116.13 million inflow, demonstrating strong investor preference. Fidelity’s FBTC and Bitwise’s BITB also enjoyed substantial inflows, indicating broad-based interest across different ETF providers. Even Grayscale’s GBTC, which has seen outflows in the past, recorded a notable inflow, along with their other BTC ETF. The Significance of US Bitcoin ETFs and Their Inflows The launch of US Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year marked a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency industry. These ETFs provide several key benefits: Mainstream Access to Bitcoin: ETFs make Bitcoin investment accessible to a much wider audience, including those with brokerage accounts who may have been hesitant to engage with crypto exchanges directly. Regulatory Oversight: Being regulated investment products, Bitcoin ETFs offer a level of security and investor protection that traditional crypto exchanges might not always provide. Liquidity and Efficiency: ETFs are traded on stock exchanges, offering high liquidity and efficient price discovery. Investors can easily buy and sell ETF shares during market hours. Portfolio Diversification: Bitcoin ETFs allow investors to diversify their portfolios by adding Bitcoin exposure without the complexities of direct ownership. The consistent positive Bitcoin ETF inflows since their inception, and particularly the strong showing on April 21st, underscore the growing demand for these products and the increasing integration of Bitcoin into mainstream investment portfolios. Are There Any Challenges or Considerations? While the surge in Bitcoin ETF inflows is undoubtedly positive, it’s important to consider a few aspects: Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin, is known for its volatility. Investors in Bitcoin ETFs should be prepared for potential price swings and understand the inherent risks. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Changes in regulations could impact the Bitcoin ETF market and the broader crypto space. Management Fees: Bitcoin ETFs typically charge management fees, which investors should factor into their investment decisions. Comparing fees across different ETFs is advisable. Tracking Error: While ETFs aim to track the price of Bitcoin, there can be slight deviations due to various factors, known as tracking error. Investors should be aware of this potential difference. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors The recent Bitcoin ETF inflows data offers several actionable insights for crypto investors: Monitor ETF Flows: Keep an eye on daily and weekly ETF inflow data as an indicator of market sentiment and institutional interest in Bitcoin. Websites and financial news sources regularly publish this information. Diversify ETF Holdings: Consider diversifying your Bitcoin ETF investments across different providers like ARK Invest, Fidelity, and BlackRock to mitigate risk and potentially benefit from varying ETF strategies. Research ETF Performance: Don’t just focus on inflows. Research the long-term performance, expense ratios, and tracking accuracy of different Bitcoin ETFs before making investment decisions. Stay Informed on Market News: Keep abreast of Bitcoin ETF news and broader cryptocurrency market developments to make informed investment choices. Regulatory updates, technological advancements, and macroeconomic factors can all influence the crypto market. Conclusion: A Bullish Signal for Bitcoin and Crypto ETFs The $381.89 million net inflow into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on April 21st is a powerful signal of growing investor confidence and the increasing maturity of the cryptocurrency market. Led by strong performances from ARKB, FBTC, and BITB, these inflows highlight the appeal of Bitcoin ETFs as a mainstream investment vehicle. As institutional and retail interest continues to build, crypto ETF investment is poised to play an even more significant role in shaping the future of digital asset adoption. This surge reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is solidifying its position as a valuable asset class within the global financial landscape, and Bitcoin ETFs are providing a critical bridge for wider participation.

The surge came after Trump posted on Truth Social Monday night, labeling Powell “Mr Too Late” and demanding the Fed cut rates “NOW.” The clash raised investor fears over the economy and sent traders straight into haven mode. Investors scrambled to park their money somewhere less exposed to the chaos in Washington. Trump, now back in the White House, reignited pressure on Powell just days after the Fed Chain warned that the administration’s tariff blitz could increase inflation and slow down growth. The rising tension between the president and the central bank rattled an already jittery market still dealing with the fallout from US trade policies. Trump’s post tanks dollar and stocks, lifts gold Markets didn’t wait to react. The S&P 500 dropped 2.4%, while the Nasdaq cratered 2.6%. Over in Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 lost 0.7%, and London’s FTSE 100 opened flat. The dollar index, which compares the greenback against a basket of major currencies, slipped another 0.2%, dragging its yearly decline close to 10%. The yen strengthened past ¥140 per dollar, something that hadn’t happened since last September. Trump’s repeated attacks on Powell go back years, but this fresh wave of criticism comes at a time when Fed credibility is already under stress. Analysts at RBC said : “Headlines about Trump’s pressure on the Federal Reserve, questions about its independence and his ability to fire Powell — regardless of the outcome — have added uncertainty to a market already flush with uncertainty.” The bond market barely budged, though it wasn’t calm. 10-year Treasury yields edged up 0.02 points to 4.43%, and the 30-year yield rose the same to 4.93%. The minimal move reflected caution more than confidence. The Fed kept rates steady this year after three straight cuts in 2024, including a large 50-basis-point drop in September. The next meeting is in May, and it now carries even more weight as investors watch whether Powell holds firm or flinches under Trump’s pressure. Powell’s job is also now a bigger question mark. Trump hasn’t been subtle about wanting him gone, and some economists warned that any move to oust him before his May 2026 term ends could hurt the economy even more. Michael Feroli, chief US economist at JPMorgan Chase, said, “Any reduction in the independence of the Fed would add upside risks to an inflation outlook that is already subject to upward pressures from tariffs and somewhat elevated inflation expectations.” Gold didn’t just climb on drama. It’s been rising all year, up 33% since January. Some investors use it to guard against inflation. Others just want something that doesn’t involve the Fed or the dollar. Data from Standard Chartered showed that more than $19 billion flowed into gold-backed ETFs in the first quarter alone. The dollar index, stuck at 98.33, hovered just above its lowest point since March 2022, after sinking to 97.923 the day before. The greenback keeps falling as investors flee US assets or hedge against potential rate cuts. Meanwhile, Bitcoin barely moved. At press time, it sat at $88,481, looking tame compared to the chaos in fiat markets. The crypto king has disappointed traders so far in 2025. It reached $100,000 but failed to stay there. Now it’s coasting just below resistance around $90,000. A push of less than 5% could send it testing $92,540, the high from February 25. Two momentum indicators—Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)—both point to a possible bullish turn. But for now, Bitcoin is steady, not spectacular.

Perhaps, popular crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe, Bitcoin might take a small dip to $76,604 before going higher. He also believes that a deal between the U.S. and China could help push the price up again. But will Bitcoin break out soon, or is it about to cool off? Bitcoin Is Near a Strong Resistance Again In a recent tweet post, van de Poppe shared a chart showing Bitcoin’s recent bounce and its approach to a critical resistance zone around $88,244–$86,549. This area has been a tough spot for Bitcoin in the past. Every time it reaches near this level, it gets pushed back down. #Bitcoin attacking the highs. I think we'll see one more pullback to test whether there's enough buying pressure. After that, we'll likely see a deal between China – US and we'll run back upwards. pic.twitter.com/WLfhyontxY — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) April 22, 2025 But things might be different this time. Poppe’s chart suggests that if Bitcoin sees another small pullback, possibly retesting the $80,982 area, it could act as a healthy reset. He believes that this correction, if it happens, will test whether buyers still have enough strength to push the price higher. But if Bitcoin doesn’t hold at that level and drops more, it might go down to around $76,604. This was a support level earlier, but now could act as a new resistance. Global Events Will Pump Bitcoin Price Interestingly, the analyst also hinted at something bigger on the horizon, a potential deal between the U.S. and China. If such a deal reduces market tensions, Bitcoin might see a boost. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price saw a slight increase after the world’s biggest corporate Bitcoin holder, Strategy, bought around 6,556 coins for about $555.8 million. As of now, Bitcoin’s price is slowly rising above $88,500, with a 1.5% increase in the last 24 hours.",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-22 09:44:45

Here’s Why John Deaton Believes It Will Happen,https://timestabloid.com/will-xrp-flip-ethereum-this-cycle-heres-why-john-deaton-believes-it-will-happen/,"In a recent tweet, Abs, a well-known crypto researcher and host of the Good Morning Crypto show, raised a question to his audience: “Will XRP flip ETH this cycle?” The tweet captioned a video discussion with pro-crypto attorney John E. Deaton, whose remarks added weight to the speculation. Deaton, known for his outspoken commentary on regulatory affairs in the digital asset space, stated plainly that he believes XRP will overtake Ethereum in the coming cycle. WILL $XRP FLIP $ETH THIS CYCLE? 🙌🇺🇸 @JohnEDeaton1 BELIEVES IT HAPPENS! Does XRP Flip Ethereum In 2025? 🤔💭 Comment Below & Follow For More!!👇👇 https://t.co/QaiGDkSAYY pic.twitter.com/k60LqvWdP6 — Good Morning Crypto (@AbsGMCrypto) April 19, 2025 Abs initiated the conversation by referencing Ethereum shortcomings , specifically noting its limitations in performance and cost. He framed the question around real-world utility and recent shifts in community sentiment, particularly since the election of Donald Trump. According to Abs, Ethereum is becoming increasingly impractical for broad-scale adoption due to its slow transaction speeds and high fees. He pointed to waning enthusiasm within the Ethereum community and then asked Deaton for his perspective on XRP’s potential to surpass Ethereum. Deaton Points to Historical Precedents and Regulatory Factors John Deaton responded by emphasizing the regulatory challenges that have suppressed XRP’s market performance in recent years. He recalled that in January 2018, XRP briefly held the number two market position behind Bitcoin. Deaton highlighted that even after the Hinman speech on June 14, 2018, which gave Ethereum and Bitcoin unofficial regulatory clarity, XRP still surpassed Ethereum temporarily in October 2018. Deaton criticized Ethereum for not capitalizing on what he referred to as “the greatest regulatory advantage of any asset class.” He stated that the Hinman speech offered Ethereum a unique opportunity to solidify its position through regulatory clarity, something most other digital assets lacked at the time. According to him, Ethereum did not fully leverage this advantage, and as a result, some investors and developers have lost confidence in its long-term trajectory. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 He reiterated that his views might not sit well with Ethereum supporters but maintained that he was being honest about the current dynamics. Deaton clearly stated that while he does not believe Ethereum will collapse or disappear, he is confident in XRP’s potential to overtake it. He cited the strength and resilience of the XRP community as a major factor and reaffirmed his belief that the asset is on a promising path forward. A Broader Shift Toward Utility in the Digital Asset Market Abs’s tweet and the discussion underscore a growing emphasis on real-world utility as a metric for long-term success in the digital asset space. XRP, with its focus on cross-border payments and institutional adoption , is increasingly viewed as a contender for a higher market position, especially in light of Ethereum’s scalability and cost challenges. As this cycle progresses toward 2025, observers in the crypto industry will closely monitor both assets. While Ethereum continues its shift toward Layer 2 solutions and staking-based security, XRP is recovering momentum after years of legal uncertainty. According to Deaton, the outcome may depend less on speculation and more on each asset’s ability to solve real problems in finance and technology. Abs’s post has re-centered attention on this competitive dynamic, presenting a scenario that may become more plausible as market conditions evolve. Whether or not XRP ultimately flips Ethereum, the conversation reflects a maturing market where utility and clarity are gaining precedence over hype.

According to a policy paper seen by Politico, the ECB has asked for a revision of the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies just months after it came into effect. The concern is that US reforms backed by President Donald Trump could flood European markets with dollar-denominated stablecoins. The ECB fears this could trigger a flight of European capital into US assets, undermining EU financial sovereignty and exposing banks to liquidity risks. ECB and European Commission Clash Over MiCA Rules While the ECB calls for tighter controls, the European Commission dismissed the warnings as exaggerated, per the report. The report, citing two diplomats and one EU official, said that the existing MiCA framework is robust enough to manage stablecoin risks despite potential US policies like the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) , two bills aimed at expanding America’s crypto footprint. “The Commission was quite clear that they had different views on this topic,” and “not very many (countries) supported the idea that we should now jump the gun and start making quick changes in (the rules) based on this alone,” one of the diplomats reportedly told Politico. The stablecoin sector now commands a valuation of $234 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap . The ECB warned that European issuers could face redemption pressures from EU and foreign holders without stricter limits, potentially sparking a financial “run” and harming exposed institutions. “The worry is warranted,” Mikko Ohtamaa, co-founder and CEO at Trading Strategy, said in a post on X. “However, the EU had the first mover advantage with the regulation and they screwed it up.” Ohtamaa said no EU stablecoin is globally competitive due to MiCA’s restrictive rules, which are influenced by bank and legacy finance lobbying.

Last year, CEO Paolo Ardoino argued that MiCA’s requirements, particularly the mandate for stablecoin issuers to hold at least 60% of reserves in EU bank accounts, could introduce systemic risks to both stablecoins and the broader banking system. Due to noncompliance with MiCA, Tether’s USDt ( USDT ) has faced delistings from major European exchanges, including Coinbase , Crypto.com and Kraken . Magazine: Altcoin season to hit in Q2?

On the other hand, Bitcoin (BTC) climbed, finishing the day up 2.7%. With gold continuing its parabolic rise, is this the time for these two assets to become the safe-havens they were created for? $1.5 trillion wiped from U.S. stock markets With China proving to be a steadfast opponent of President Trump’s tariffs strategy, the US markets are going through the utmost turmoil. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq, all experienced sharp declines on the day, and an estimated total of more than $1.5 trillion was wiped off across public American companies . Trump Vs Powell It’s not just the trade war with China and the rest of the world that is making the markets seethe and boil continuously, but also the very public battle between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. While Powell maintains that the Federal Reserve is completely independent of the US government, President Trump is constantly attacking the Fed Chairman, most recently, in a social media post, calling him a “major loser” for not lowering interest rates. With markets extremely concerned over the possibility of the Federal Reserve losing its independence to the Trump administration, at the same time, some might acknowledge that the Federal Reserve is in fact a private institution with much influence wielded by the big U.S. banks. $BTC achieves a higher high Source: TradingView The short-term chart for $BTC demonstrates that the bulls were finally able to hold the $87,000 horizontal level and turn it into support. The price has since consolidated above and has made its way up to the very important $88,600 resistance. The huge positive achieved earlier on Tuesday was a higher high. This now opens the door to a complete reversal of the downward trend that has persisted ever since $BTC reached its $109,000 top. Nevertheless, with all short-term Stochastic RSIs at the top, a downward impulse could be on the way. Whether this takes the price back to $87,000, or the top of the pennant at around $85,000, remains to be seen. A breakout of the $88,630 resistance could come first. $BTC pauses at 200-day SMA Source: TradingView The daily timeframe for $BTC shows that the price is currently nudging up against the 200-day simple moving average. Bearing in mind that the price is also up against the big trend-change resistance level, this may be a great place for the next corrective impulse. This would potentially be the time to make a higher low before going on to break through the 200-day SMA and back up to the highs. The Stochastic RSI can be seen towards the bottom of the chart, with the indicator lines right at the top, and ready to turn back down, while just below this, the RSI is displaying the same break of trend as the price chart above. There is the possibility that this trendline could be retested. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

However, the Solana price, which has been trying hard to sustain above the resistance at $140, seems to be preparing for a 50% upswing, but only when the SOL price satisfies some conditions. In a recent update, Solana has surpassed Ethereum in staking market capitalization, which is seen as a significant step in growing adoption. The rise in its dominance compared to other popular chains like Ethereum depicts the rising popularity of the altcoin. On the other hand, a Solana whale unstaked a huge amount of SOL tokens in the past few hours, which is expected to increase the volatility of the token. As per the data from Lookonchain , nearly 100K SOL tokens have been unstaked in the past few hours and deposited into Binance. The whale has held these tokens for the past 4 years at the base price of $27. Moreover, the whale still holds over a million SOL tokens, while his total profits amount to over $153 million. This may flash a bearish signal, but only for a short time frame, as the fear of substantial selling may hinder the SOL price rally. What’s Next for the Solana (SOL) Price Rally? The SOL price has broken the descending trend line that it had held since the start of the year, hinting towards a rise in the bullish dominance. Meanwhile, the price has been failing to break through the resistance zone between $146.5 and $150 since the March drop, which had raised concerns. However, the bulls are on another attempt to rise above the range, but the drop in the money flow suggests the SOL price breakout could be delayed for a while. The historical chart of the SOL price suggests the token is trading under a bullish influence, and the latest rebound substantiates the claim. The rise in the buyer’s activity has slashed the selling pressure in the long term, as suggested by the MACD, which is heading for a bullish crossover. However, the CMF, the money flow indicator, has dropped below 0, while the attempt at a recovery seems to be nullified. This suggests that the token is still in the distribution phase, and hence a breakout can occur once the CMF rises back above 0, indicating the beginning of the accumulation phase. Although the Solana price seems to be poised to maintain a strong ascending trend, the token is required to surpass the immediate resistance zone around $148 to $150. This could attract fresh liquidity onto the platform, which may help the SOL price to reach $200.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|SOL|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-22 09:56:37

The primary cryptocurrency’s price felt the adverse consequences of Trump’s trade war a couple of weeks back, when it plunged to a multi-month low beneath $75,000. However, the subsequent tariff pause, as well as the positive inflation data for March in the US, started an immediate recovery that continues to this day. By the end of that week, BTC had already reclaimed the $80,000 level and hasn’t looked back since. Moreover, it kept climbing gradually and spiked above $86,000 on a few occasions last week. It failed there at first and, after a quiet weekend, went on the offensive once again on Monday when it spiked by over three grand from $84,000 to $87,500. It was stopped there at first, but the bulls pushed hard, and bitcoin tapped $88,950 (on Bitstamp) for the first time since early March.

As co-founder Vitalik Buterin steps back from day-to-day responsibilities to concentrate on long-term research, the network also faces renewed criticism from Bitcoin advocate PlanB. The pseudonymous analyst has questioned Ethereum’s centralization, governance model, and technical complexity, sparking debate across the crypto community about the network’s direction and design choices. PlanB Reignites Feud With Vitalik Buterin in Fiery Ethereum Attack The long-standing philosophical and technical divide between Bitcoin and Ethereum reached a new boiling point over the weekend as PlanB, the pseudonymous creator of the controversial Bitcoin stock-to-flow (S2F) model, launched a fresh barrage of criticism aimed at Ethereum and its co-founder Vitalik Buterin. On April 21, PlanB mockingly resurfaced a 2022 tweet from Buterin in which the Ethereum founder lambasted the S2F model for being inaccurate during a market downturn. Buterin wrote at the time, “Stock-to-flow is really not looking good now.” In a sharp rebuttal nearly two years later, PlanB posted: “Ethereum is really not looking good now.” The tit-for-tat exchange has ignited a broader conversation about decentralization, network architecture, and ideological differences between the two leading blockchain networks. Ethereum Under Fire: Centralization, PoS, and Disk Space Woes PlanB, known for his staunch Bitcoin maximalism, went on to criticize Ethereum’s foundational design and governance model. Among his key points was Ethereum’s shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), which he argued compromised the network’s decentralization and trustless nature. He said that Ethereum’s evolving monetary policy, including changes in ETH issuance over the years, contrasted sharply with Bitcoin’s fixed 21 million coin supply—a cornerstone of the Bitcoin value thesis. PlanB also highlighted a more technical issue: the size and complexity of running a full Ethereum node. “I can not run [an Ethereum full node],” he lamented, referencing the large disk space requirements. Indeed, Ethereum’s archival nodes—used for comprehensive historical queries—require over 21 terabytes of space, according to data from Etherscan . Even a pruned full node running the Geth client can consume over 1.2 terabytes. In comparison, a Bitcoin full node typically uses less than 700 gigabytes and can be run with significantly less computational overhead. PlanB argued that this disparity undermines Ethereum’s decentralization, as fewer users are capable of independently verifying the chain. However, not everyone sees PlanB’s criticism as valid or productive. Jeremiah O’Connor, CTO of crypto security firm Trugard, dismissed the remarks as “classic Bitcoin maxi energy.” He acknowledged the legitimate concerns around Ethereum’s reliance on centralized infrastructure providers such as Infura but emphasized the network’s ongoing efforts to evolve. In another jab, PlanB referenced Ethereum’s controversial 2016 DAO hack rollback, which saw the blockchain reversed to undo a $60 million exploit. “The fact that this is even possible should worry you,” he posted, warning against what he sees as Ethereum’s manipulable governance. But this critique triggered immediate pushback from historians in the crypto community, who reminded PlanB that Bitcoin itself underwent a rollback in 2010 after an inflation bug minted 184 billion BTC in a single transaction. The incident was patched by Satoshi Nakamoto and other developers, rolling back the chain by one block. A Deepening Divide Between Bitcoin and Ethereum Maximalists PlanB’s recent comments add fuel to the ongoing divide between Bitcoin and Ethereum supporters. His S2F model, once hailed for its price predictions, has lost some credibility after its forecasts failed to align with market realities in recent years. Still, PlanB retains a large following and significant influence in Bitcoin circles. By mocking Buterin and Ethereum’s design, PlanB is reinforcing a growing sentiment among Bitcoin maximalists who believe Ethereum’s flexibility and programmability come at the cost of decentralization and monetary soundness. But for Ethereum advocates, those same design choices are what make the network vibrant, flexible, and forward-looking. They argue that Ethereum’s adaptability, large developer base, and broad use cases—from DeFi to NFTs—make it more than just an alternative store of value. While PlanB and Buterin may appear at ideological odds, both Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dominate the digital asset space in their respective niches. As Bitcoin holds strong as a decentralized store of value, Ethereum powers a sprawling, programmable financial and digital services layer. As Jeremiah O’Connor aptly put it, “Both matter. One is the rock. The other is the playground. Together, they define what crypto is today.” Ethereum Foundation Charts a New Course: Focus Shifts to UX and Layer-1 Scaling After Leadership Overhaul In related news, the Ethereum Foundation is recalibrating its strategic priorities following a recent leadership reshuffle aimed at optimizing the network’s development trajectory. According to an April 21 post by newly appointed co-executive director Tomasz Stańczak, the nonprofit will now dedicate greater attention to user experience (UX), Layer-1 scalability, and near-term protocol enhancements—all while giving Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin the freedom to focus on high-impact research and innovation. The shift signals a renewed push by the foundation to address lingering pain points in Ethereum’s ecosystem, including transaction privacy, execution speed, and network congestion, while reinforcing its long-standing commitment to decentralization and community-driven development. Leadership Reshuffle Frees Up Buterin to Innovate The leadership transition, announced on March 1, saw Tomasz Stańczak, CEO of Nethermind, and core researcher Hsiao-Wei Wang assume the roles of co-executive directors effective March 17. The move was designed to allow Buterin to step away from the demands of day-to-day operations and crisis response, enabling him to concentrate on long-term protocol design and research. “Each time Vitalik shares insights or communicates a direction, he accelerates major long-term breakthroughs,” Stańczak wrote in his X post, applauding Buterin’s role as Ethereum’s philosophical and technical North Star. Since stepping back, Buterin has wasted no time diving deep into Ethereum’s most complex challenges. On April 11, he released a comprehensive roadmap for enhancing transaction privacy, calling for default-enabled anonymization features that would shield user identity and activity on the blockchain. Just days later, on April 20, Buterin proposed a bold rethinking of Ethereum’s execution layer, suggesting a transition away from the current EVM bytecode toward a more efficient RISC-V-inspired framework. Stańczak emphasized that while Buterin’s proposals “always carry weight,” they are intended to kickstart meaningful discussions and catalyze innovation—not dictate consensus. “The community can either refine or reject the ideas,” he said, reinforcing Ethereum’s open-source ethos. With the foundation’s leadership now solidified, Stańczak outlined a new strategic emphasis: delivering near-term protocol improvements to tackle scalability bottlenecks and enhance user experience. A central focus is Layer-1 scaling—the core of Ethereum’s base protocol—which has long been criticized for high gas fees and slow throughput during peak network activity. While Layer-2 solutions like rollups and sidechains have gained traction, Stańczak believes the base layer must continue to evolve. The Ethereum Foundation will also place greater emphasis on supporting Layer-2 ecosystems and improving interoperability, ensuring a more seamless experience for developers and end-users. These themes will underpin Ethereum’s next major upgrades—Pectra, Fusaka, and Glamsterdam—which are expected to bring measurable improvements to protocol efficiency, security, and accessibility. Stańczak added that while the foundation is homing in on short-term results, it remains equally committed to nurturing long-term innovations. This includes work on next-generation execution and consensus layers, which could be deployed within a two-year window thanks to accelerated timelines and contributions from top researchers. A Delicate Balancing Act Between Pragmatism and Vision The Ethereum Foundation now finds itself at a pivotal juncture—caught between the immediate need for usability and the visionary drive to remain at the forefront of decentralized technology. Stańczak’s leadership appears aimed at harmonizing these two imperatives. Still, the broader Ethereum community remains an integral part of shaping the network’s future. Every proposal, even from Buterin, is treated as a starting point—one that must survive community scrutiny, client team alignment, and rigorous technical evaluation before it sees daylight on the mainnet.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-22 10:00:00

Analysts revised headline inflation forecasts upward, now seeing 2.2% in 2025 and 2.0% in 2026, both up by 0.1 percentage points from earlier this year. For 2027, inflation stays flat at 2.0%. These forecasts are based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the ECB’s standard measure of inflation. Expectations for core inflation, which strips out volatile energy and food prices, also moved higher across all timeframes. The projection for long-term core inflation now sits at 2.0%, adjusted slightly up from the last survey. Longer-term headline inflation stayed locked at 2.0%, showing the ECB doesn’t expect runaway prices—just that things won’t calm down as fast as hoped. Source: ECB Forecasts for Eurozone GDP growth also changed, as analysts now expect real GDP to expand by only 0.9% in 2025, down 0.1 points from earlier predictions. In 2026, growth is set at 1.2%, also 0.1 points lower, according to the ECB’s survey. By 2027, the picture brightens slightly with 1.4% growth, a 0.1 point upward revision. Beyond that, long-term GDP growth remains unchanged at 1.3%, meaning the central bank sees no meaningful economic acceleration coming anytime soon. The job market forecast got a small boost. The expected average unemployment rate across 2025 to 2027 is now 6.3%, a bit lower than before. Beyond 2027, the ECB sees unemployment falling to 6.2%. While not dramatic, it shows a slight tightening of the labor market. Trump’s return fuels uncertainty in the Eurozone The updated forecasts come just under three months into Donald Trump’s second term as US president, a reality already shaking Europe’s political and economic foundations. Trump declared the European Union was created to “screw the United States,” and followed that up with tariffs targeting European goods. His White House has shown little interest in defending NATO allies, raising doubts about transatlantic commitments. Trump has cozied up to Vladimir Putin, dismissed Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and floated solutions to the war in Ukraine that would directly undercut European security. His national security team even insulted Europe in a Signal chat, calling the continent “pathetic,” while his vice-president mocked European democratic systems. Economists and policymakers now see a window to push internal reforms. Finishing the capital markets union and banking union could unlock nearly €3 trillion in idle savings across the Eurozone, freeing it for cross-border investment. Talks about this have stalled for years, but the change in Washington may finally light a fire under Brussels. With the US turning inward, European leaders are seeking deals with countries and regions still interested in cutting tariffs, not using them as political weapons. There’s increased focus on expanding deals with Asia, Africa, and South America, where nations now view the EU as more stable than an isolationist US or a hostile Russia. Europe is also discussing ways to build joint defense capabilities, in case Trump pulls the US away from NATO responsibilities, according to a report from The Guardian. These talks reportedly include possible military support to Ukraine, especially in the form of medium-range missiles, to fill the vacuum left by US reluctance. Some officials argue Europe must prepare to defend its own interests with or without American help. There’s also momentum behind building global alliances with other pro-democracy countries like Japan, India, Canada, and Australia, all of whom are increasingly skeptical of US foreign policy under Trump. European diplomats are pushing for stronger coalitions to protect liberal democracies and keep global trade flowing under agreed rules. Despite all this friction, Europe isn’t giving up on the transatlantic economy. The EU and US still maintain the world’s largest bilateral investment relationship, with over $5 trillion in combined assets in 2023. And the Eurozone remains the biggest single market on the planet, home to 448 million consumers. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Crypto is out of narratives, out of patience, and running out of time to matter. The only way out is forward—by building products people actually use and don’t have to think about. For the past several months, AI agents have been pitched as that future, but most of them are just noise: flashy wrappers that don’t actually do anything. You might also like: Put developers at the center of web3 | Opinion In the middle of a macro meltdown, with Ethereum’s ( ETH ) value against Bitcoin ( BTC ) hitting five-year lows and Bitcoin trading like a high-beta tech stock, no one is begging for another DEX, bridge, or wallet extension. The problem isn’t discoverability. It is a utility. We’ve built an industry optimized for speculation, not service. A financial arcade, not a functioning economy. Most crypto apps don’t have users because they don’t solve anything real. Volatility is the tell. If crypto were used at scale, real demand would anchor the price. But when macro conditions shift, the whole sector moves in lockstep—because actual usage doesn’t matter. That’s not a UX issue. That’s a product problem. If crypto wants to survive this phase—let alone escape the echo chamber in the next cycle—we need to stop building abstractions for each other and start building real products for real people. Why it keeps happening Crypto has never grown out of its builder-for-builder roots. Success is defined by shipping, not retention. We reward composability over usability. Launches over DAUs. TVL over usefulness. That’s how we ended up with a wave of AI agents that look good in demos but fall apart in practice—built to impress, not to endure. Builders build for other builders. Teams optimize for token launches, not long-term users. Most roadmaps are driven by narrative timing, not customer feedback. The result? Products that impress on crypto Twitter but don’t matter to anyone outside of it. User experience is still considered surface-level polish when it should be foundational. We talk about onboarding like it’s a marketing problem, not an architectural one. And we wonder why users churn faster than altcoins collapse. Not all AI agents are the answer Take a look at what’s been happening with AI agents in crypto. We’re pretending automation means intelligence. But users don’t need agents that talk. They need agents that do. And they need agents that can operate with intent: taking autonomous action, interacting onchain, and accruing value, not just information. If this is going to be the narrative of the next cycle—and it might be—we need to raise the bar. What’s missing isn’t another chatbot. It’s autonomy, action, and economic alignment. The next generation of agents must be onchain actors—agents with memory, incentives, and agency. Not just slick AI interfaces, but participants in the network itself. What a real product looks like A real product solves a real problem—clearly, quickly, and without friction. It doesn’t need an explainer thread. It feels like magic, not a UI puzzle. In crypto, the magic moment happens when a product abstracts away the protocol, when it does something for the user without making them think about networks, wallets, or bridges. Imagine an AI agent that quietly monitors your wallet, and the moment your airdrop unlocks, it claims it and sells at optimal execution—no prompts, no extra steps. At the same time, it watches gas prices and dips into stable-yield reserves you forgot you had, automatically buying the dip without you lifting a finger. When you need to bridge funds or execute a transaction, it instinctively reroutes you through the cheapest and fastest network available, all without asking which chain you’re on or forcing you to approve a dozen steps. That kind of seamless automation isn’t a feature. It’s the foundation of a real product. These aren’t features. They’re outcomes. And they’re the foundation of actual adoption. And so these are the kinds of applications crypto needs to hone in on and devote resources to. Real consumer AI agents are a breakthrough here. They act on behalf of users, claiming, trading, and coordinating. They reduce surface area. They make infrastructure invisible. They don’t rely on speculative hype to attain value; they provide an actual service. That’s how we get crypto out of the power user corn maze and into everyday relevance. What needs to change (and why now) This isn’t just about good design. It’s about product discipline. And the timing has never been better. We’re not just in a bear market. We’re in a trust correction. Retail is gone. The ETF narrative is priced in. Altcoins are bleeding out. The Fed and fiscal policy are driving every headline. This is the best possible time to build—because no one’s watching. There’s no pressure to chase yield or force hype. There’s room to build quiet conviction around something real. So what should builders actually do? First, they need to design for behavior, not just composability. It’s not enough that components can plug into one another—what matters is whether people actually use them. Real product design starts with the user’s motivation and workflow, not with modularity. Second, builders should use automation and agents to reduce decision fatigue. Most crypto products overwhelm users with options. The goal should be to eliminate choices, not add more. A great product handles complexity behind the scenes so the user doesn’t have to think. Third, it’s time to prioritize retention over liquidity mining. If your product only works because there’s a token incentive attached to it, it’s not a product—it’s a promotion. Focus on building something people come back to without needing a bribe. Finally, usability should be treated as infrastructure, not decoration. The interface is not the cherry on top—it’s the bridge between function and experience. If it’s not intuitive, it’s broken. AI agents for consumers aren’t a gimmick. They’re the best shot we have at building something people actually return to. Not because they believe in your token. But because the product does something for them. Stop building for nobody We don’t need more tokenized interfaces. We don’t need more demos that explain themselves better than they perform. And we definitely don’t need another yield mechanic disguised as a product. We need software that helps people get something done. That they come back to because it works, not because they’re speculating. Consumer AI agents are the clearest path to that future. Stop building apps no one uses. Start building ones that people don’t even have to think about.

Users can now supply and borrow RLUSD, marking a new step in Ripple’s entry into the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Bullish signal here—RLUSD’s debut on Aave V3 Core isn’t just another stablecoin listing, it’s a real liquidity unlock for Ripple’s DeFi ambitions. Early volume spikes and TVL growth point to strong initial uptake, with community threads leaning positive on utility and… — Alva (@AlvaApp) April 22, 2025 The listing comes with a supply cap of $50 million and a borrow cap of $5 million. Although the current utilization rate sits at 0%, and no borrowing activity has been recorded yet, the stablecoin’s availability on Aave is seen as a key move for unlocking DeFi liquidity. Early Signs of Market Interest Despite the quiet start, early trading volume and TVL (total value locked) indicators show signs of interest. Community sentiment is largely positive, with many praising RLUSD’s potential to diversify away from dominant stablecoins like USDT and USDC. Some traders are already eyeing short-term yield opportunities, a common trend when new pools launch on Aave. With additional liquidity incentives and interest structures expected soon, analysts believe RLUSD could attract more users in the coming weeks. Targeting Enterprise and Cross-Border Payments RLUSD isn’t just another stablecoin—it’s part of Ripple’s big strategy. The token is already integrated into Ripple’s payment ecosystem, aiming to support enterprise applications and cross-border transactions. RLUSD has already hit a market value of over $293 million and processed over $10 billion in transactions. Its arrival on Aave opens new doors for utility in DeFi, especially as institutional interest in blockchain-based lending continues to grow.

The tokens are the byproduct of a past network upgrade that allowed NFT metadata accounts to be resized, reimbursing rent (in SOL) to users. The remaining tokens will be swept to the DAO unless claimed by April 25, 2025. Legal Risks and Transparency Concerns In a April 22 open letter, New York law firm Burwick Law said it had serious legal concerns about Metaplex’s approach. According to the law firm, many users weren’t properly informed and the move could be in violation of consumer protection laws. “Rent was paid so NFTs could live on-chain, not to fund a future windfall,” the letter states. It likens it to unlicensed banking fees and warns that the protocol’s action may amount to unfair enrichment. Proposed Alternative Approach Instead of sweeping all unclaimed SOL, Burwick proposes reimbursing impacted users directly via a protocol upgrade. The DAO, the firm suggests, could retain up to 10% of funds to cover ongoing network maintenance. This compromise is designed to uphold user trust while still leaving room for Metaplex’s ecosystem aspirations more broadly. Metaplex Silence Metaplex has made no public statement at the time of writing. The DAO earlier said any retrieved SOL might eventually finance community-lead initiatives like airdrops or grants, pending governance approval. A Pattern of Legal Vigilance Burwick Law boasts a history of crypto-specific litigation, including class action filing against the LIBRA token team for insider trading just recently. The law firm is urging Metaplex to alter its course of action before legal complications and loss of trust in the Solana community take effect.",Blockchain|Sticky|Regulation,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING|FORKS,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-04-22 10:08:39

At the time of his swearing-in on January 25, 2025, Bitcoin was trading at $104,824. However, the asset has dropped to $88,402 as of press time on April 22, reflecting a 15.6% decline. Bitcoin YTD price chart. Source: Finbold Hegseth’s financial disclosures revealed that he holds between $15,001 and $50,000 in Bitcoin. Pete Hegseth’s financial disclosure excerpt. Source: U.S. government With Bitcoin dropping by 15.6%, assuming a lower-end investment of $15,001, his portfolio is now valued at approximately $12,650, down about $2,350. If he held the maximum investment of $50,000 in the digital currency, his portfolio could be valued at around $42,162, reflecting a loss of approximately $7,837. Hegseth’s Bitcoin support Hegseth, currently under scrutiny for Signal chat leaks and alleged mishandling of classified information, has been a vocal supporter of Bitcoin, citing its ability to cushion investors against inflation and potential government overreach. As a Fox News commentator, he praised the cryptocurrency’s ability to serve as an alternative to traditional banking , aligning himself with conservative players supporting Bitcoin, led by President Donald Trump . Before the financial disclosure, Hegseth noted that he sold some of his Bitcoin holdings in November 2024 when the asset surged to a new record high above $80,000, as investors reacted positively to Trump’s election. At the time, he lauded Trump for making Bitcoin “great again” in anticipation of friendly laws. “Look at Trump, making bitcoin great again. All it took was signaling to that market that they weren’t going to be overregulated. Trump embraced them. “I did sell some pretty high … but I’m holding a bunch as well, so I feel good,” he said. BTC price subdued below $90,000 Over the past three months, the Bitcoin correction has been driven by growing market uncertainty from trade wars. Although Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency sector have not experienced massive swings like the stock market, the asset has largely remained stable within the $80,000 to $90,000 range. At the same time, BTC has failed to decisively react to pro-cryptocurrency developments, such as the White House’s inclusion of it in a strategic crypto reserve.

Over the past two weeks, the firm deposited 65,600 ETH (worth $105.48M) to Binance—likely for selling—and withdrew 752,240 SOL (worth $98.37M), indicating fresh accumulation. The asset manager recently staked $40 million worth of SOL , believed to be part of a broader strategic shift following its previous involvement in the LUNA token debacle. This move could reflect growing confidence in Solana’s ecosystem , which has gained momentum due to its speed, low fees, and rising developer activity, while Ethereum faces scalability challenges and increased sell pressure. It signals that Galaxy may see better short-to-mid-term potential in SOL over ETH. Notably, Galaxy Digital had already offloaded ETH in late 2024 to buy BTC, signaling a growing trend of rotating out of Ethereum. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Nearly 100M Solana Moves To Binance- Should You Worry About the SOL Price Rally? , Ethereum Foundation Joins the Sell-Off According to Lookonchain , an old wallet linked to the Ethereum Foundation sent 1,000 ETH ($1.58M) to Kraken an hour ago.

While the general sentiment in the financial markets is that 2025 will be the year of the bull, it is important to understand that this prediction also has a chance of being wrong. BTC has already breached the $100k mark, and there is a possibility that it may be at the top of this bull cycle. Hence, it is advised to do your research before investing in AMP or any other cryptocurrency with the hopes of gaining on your investment in 2025. Amp price prediction 2030 As per CoinCodex’s Amp crypto price prediction for 2030, AMP’s price could vary between $0.000271 and $0.004532. DigitalCoinPrice expects that AMP’s price could climb to $0.0194 or $0.0224 by the end of 2030. Changelly predicts that by 2030, the AMP token could range between $0.0195 and $0.0323. Before trusting any source that is trying to predict the AMP price prediction for 2030, you should understand that it is a cryptocurrency and, like all other tokens, the AMP token’s price can be highly volatile. 2030 is five years away, and many cryptocurrencies can become obsolete in that time. This is why it is hard to give a realistic price prediction for any token, including AMP. A great way for AMP to survive these five years and continue its ascent in the crypto market is to continue building its blockchain technology and partner with key players in the digital crypto space. You should research and keep yourself updated with the latest developments in the upcoming years to make an informed investment decision in the AMP token.

Before investing in any cryptocurrency, including AMP, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that the sentiment in the cryptocurrency market changes quickly, and a token that was once considered the future may also be delisted from major exchanges. Hence, it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals before having any price expectations for the future of the AMP token. Will Amp go up or down? Cryptocurrencies in general experience rapid price swings that are directly driven by market sentiments, community engagement, events like token burns, and so on. While it is hard to determine how high the AMP token will go, it is important to look out for potential buying factors that may include new partnerships, increased token holders, or viral campaigns in general. It is also vital that you rely on financial experts and consult them for Amp price prediction, but even after all that, you should remain cautious, as no one can accurately predict how high or low AMP can go. Should I invest in Amp? Before investing in any cryptocurrency or trusting any Amp price forecast, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that cryptocurrencies in general are a highly speculative investment, and their success not only relies on market volatility but also on the constant and sustainable growth of their community. Hence, it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals, which may very well decide the future of the AMP token. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Kalshi Predicts a 50% Chance,https://coinpedia.org/news/trump-bitcoin-reserve-kalshi-users-say-theres-a-50-chance/,"The post National Trump Bitcoin Reserve to Launch in 2025? Kalshi Predicts a 50% Chance appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News On March 6, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President signed an Executive Order establishing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve and a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile . This marked a major step in integrating digital assets into the U.S. financial framework. For now, the reserve only holds Bitcoin seized through criminal and civil forfeiture cases. But many believe this could be the beginning of something much bigger. Is the U.S. Preparing a Full-Scale National Bitcoin Reserve? Although limited in scope today, talk is growing around a possible expansion into a full National Bitcoin Reserve. The idea would mirror the structure of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but for digital assets. Prediction market platform Kalshi currently puts the chances of such a move at 50%. This potential reserve would include Bitcoin not obtained through seizures – and could even involve other cryptocurrencies. Importantly, the Kalshi contract requires that the reserve be fully functional and operational, not just announced. Market Sentiment on the Move Kalshi’s data shows just how much public sentiment has shifted in the past few months: 57.2% probability at the start of 2025 41.2% low on January 9 70.6% peak on March 6 (following Trump’s executive order) 50% as of April 22 This swing reflects growing interest and speculation as the administration takes real action on crypto policy. Timeline: Trump’s Key Moves on Bitcoin and Crypto July 2024 – Trump announces plan for a Bitcoin Reserve during campaign Nov 2024 – Wins the U.S. Presidential election ; promises pro-crypto cabinet members Dec 2024 – Plans nomination of Paul S. Atkins as SEC chair Jan 2025 – Forms a crypto regulation task force via the SEC Mar 2025 – Signs Executive Order to form the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Each of these steps suggests a broader digital asset strategy may be in the works. What a National Bitcoin Reserve Could Mean If Trump moves forward with a fully operational National Bitcoin Reserve, it could mark a historic turning point in U.S. economic policy. It would position Bitcoin not just as a financial asset, but as a strategic one. Such a development could: Enhance investor trust in U.S. crypto policies Accelerate regulatory clarity and institutional adoption Signal America’s leadership in global digital finance Still, much will depend on how the plan is executed, how it aligns politically, and how other countries respond. The days of digital assets sitting on the sidelines of U.S. policy may be numbered, and Bitcoin just took one step closer to the main stage.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-22 11:27:35

Altcoins are poised for growth, driven by expanding use cases and a favorable regulatory environment, but liquidity remains a key catalyst. The recent “digestion period” coincided with rising Bitcoin Dominance and falling Altcoin prices. Altcoin pricing behavior can be characterized as long-dated Call Options. Avoid FOMO; dollar-cost-average into Altcoins when indicators and liquidity conditions are favorable. Introduction I’ve written several articles highlighting the twists & turns of Bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) journey, to which it eventually broke through $100K. In my last article, entitled Bitcoin: Passing the Baton to Altcoins , I alerted readers to prepare for the upcoming “Altcoin Season” saying we’re probably six months away (meaning May’25). This article updates On-Chain Metrics, discusses my Altcoin Framework, introduces a new concept of Altcoin pricing behavior and concludes with a portfolio strategy. Bitcoin’s still in a Bull Market If we look back to the major Bull cycles of Bitcoin, we can start with the first cycle of 2009–2011 onwards to 2023-2025. We are now in the second year of the Fourth Halving . The Bull market typically develops into a parabolic (and final “blow off” stage). Year to date, Bitcoin’s down ~30% from its ATH, and the shallower decline suggests it’s a Bull market Correction – not a cycle decline. Glassnode On-Chain Metrics (“OCTA”) and Off-Chain Indicators Now that we’ve determined we’re in a Bull cycle, we can utilize OCTA to determine local peaks and bottoms. I utilize a holistic approach to measuring risk including Sentiment and a slew of On-Chain Metrics. They are again showing confluence – meaning indicators from different data-sets and different assets (Bitcoin, Crypto, Equities..) are giving the same reading. Most have changed from Bearish in Nov’24 to moderately Bullish as of Apr’25. Some of the major categories and their readings are below: Sentiment (Bullish readings, both Equity and Crypto) Blockchain Usage (Neutral reading) Investor Profitability (Bullish especially for ST holders) Global Liquidity (Moderately Bullish) Derivative Positioning (Neutral) Exchange Flows (Bullish) Sentiment (“Fear & Greed”: Bullish reading) The chart below is Bitcoin’s price color-coded with the Fear & Greed index and as you can see, the index moved from Extreme Greed (~ 90) at the time of my last article, to Fear (~ 25 ). This suggests that Bitcoin prices are nearing a local bottom – there’s strong support in the chart at $67K-$70K. BGeometrics Blockchain Usage (Active addresses: Neutral reading, Exchange Flows: Bullish) Investors have removed the largest number of Bitcoins (measured Y/Y by Glassnode) in history, meaning investors are “holding” their Bitcoins. Active address growth has been lackluster since March’24, which is somewhat concerning. However, the decline may be attributed to a shift from personal wallets to custodied Bitcoin ETFs. On the other hand, there is expanding demand from governmental (state and central), corporations (private and public) and asset managers (ETFs, Exchanges…). The website Bitcoin-treasuries is a way to monitor this demand over time and their heat map is below. BGeometrics Bitcoin Treasuries Investor Profitability (Neutral to Bullish) Overall, investors have about 75% of their BTC holdings in profit (not a good sign as it could portend selling). However, a drilldown reveals that the LTH (long-term holder) cohort (which is less likely to sell) has most of these gains. Newer Retail Investors (“STH” on the lower chart) are experiencing losses matching previous bear markets. These “weak-hands” are likely witnessing seller exhaustion. Glassnode Glassnode Derivative Positioning (Neutral to slightly Bullish) Data has moved from Extremely Bearish last Nov’24 to Neutral as Futures Open Interest and Funding Rates have come down from peak levels. The options market is more bullish as the Delta Skew is at the high end (~ 0.08) of its 2Y range. This means that investors are worried about a correction, so they’re buying more protection via Put options. BGeometrics Bitcoin Dominance continues BTC Dominance will likely continue until the Federal Reserve pivots or Global Liquidity accelerates. Presently, BTC Dominance is 63% and recent history suggests it’ll peak around 68%. Remember, Bitcoin has its own unique “Digital Gold” narrative and doesn’t have to worry about competing with 25,000 Altcoins! My Framework for Altcoin Season Fundamentally, “things look good” for Altcoins given: The defanging of the SEC Support by the U.S. Congress A pro-crypto Trump Administration Expanding use-cases (e.g., Defi, DePin, Prediction markets, Gaming/NFTs, Authentication) Altcoins as Call Options My framework is that as Bitcoin rises, a wealth-effect is created and investors become overconfident. They then trade on leverage and sell Bitcoin for faster horses. The established narrative is that this occurs a year or two after the Bitcoin Halving; however, my belief is that the strong gains in Altcoins are reflecting the Liquidity Cycle – not the Halving Cycle. This means Altcoins could continue declining both absolutely or in BTC terms until the Liquidity catalyst arrives. Crypto OGs often say that tokens are similar to venture capital portfolio companies with most failing over time. According to a study conducted by Coingecko, over 14,000 crypto projects have failed (as of 2023) and approximately 70% fail during each cycle. Given crypto’s low entry-barriers, a high failure rate is “par for the course.” Call me cynical, but I characterize the movement of Altcoins as equity Call Options . In fact, I would expect the same type of investor to be purchasing both Call options and Altcoins. Both are great ways to get rich quick or lose your shirt. When I studied Risk Management, required reading was on what’s called the Option Greeks . They are Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, and Rho. These metrics quantify how an option's price is affected by various factors, including the underlying asset's price, time decay, volatility, and interest rates. Altcoins then, are similar to long-dated Call Options that are sensitive to Delta (i.e., change vs. Bitcoin’s price) and they degrade over time (“Theta”). As a sidenote, the Indicators that I’ve shown have historically done a good job at timing major tops & bottoms; however, they are not practical for timing the next Altseason as Altcoins tend to run-up after the indicators have bottomed and when Bitcoin is rising (think of the Delta concept). ProjectFinance Altcoin Dominance A method of measuring price-decline in “crypto terms” is examining a crypto’s token price in BTC terms. Let’s focus on Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) as a proxy for the Altcoin market. Most observers would probably agree that Ethereum’s a Top-10 project with strong fundamentals. Still, the ETH/BTC ratio has declined sharply over time. ETH/BTC declined a whopping 77% between “ The Merge ” (in September 2022) and today, where it sits at 0.0188 . This means ETH’s price is worth less than 2% of Bitcoin’s. That’s a shocking development considering that the 2017 narrative was for an “ETH flippening.” TradingView Liquidity is the “Light at the end of the Tunnel” While demand catalysts should be able to boost the price of Altcoins, the fact is that they haven’t. Until the Federal Reserve pivots, I expect the ETH/BTC ratio to decay towards the 2019 low of 0.0164 . But even then, that low was halted only because the Fed started pumping liquidity into the market. And even this takes time; according to GMI’s Raoul Pal, there’s a 10 week lag between gains in liquidity and gains in crypto prices. (Note that the red line in the chart above shows liquidity as measured by the Fed’s balance sheet, while the last chart shows liquidity in terms of M2 Money Supply.) Dysfunctioning Fixed-Income markets may force a Fed Pivot There’s evidence of dysfunctional markets. For example, the MOVE Index has risen sharply, CCC-rated credit spreads have risen and participants are having difficulties pricing collateral. Some examples include: lack of Junk Bond and Leveraged Loan issuance (lowest on record since 2013) and the postponement of several IPOs such as Circle (the company behind the USDC Stablecoin). Bloomberg LLC Treasuries are acting “weird”, for example, 30Y treasury bond prices are declining along with the US Dollar and Equities. This is a rare event, as Treasuries typically act as a “safe-haven” asset in weak markets . If this continues, the U.S. Treasury and or Fed will have to support markets by injecting liquidity. Portfolio Strategy I believe crypto investors should have a 70/30 strategic allocation to Bitcoin and Altcoins, meaning 70% of your portfolio should be in Bitcoin through the cycle, depending on your “risk appetite.” As Bitcoin reaches the Halving Event, I would advise slowly changing allocation to 50/50. The key factors determining what your Altcoin exposure should be are: Indicators, Bitcoin Dominance peaking, and most importantly, Liquidity. Global Liquidity has improved this year, but it hasn’t reached the tipping point, and a portion of this rise was attributed to US Dollar weakness. I would prefer M2 grow above 8% Y/Y compared to the 6% rate of today. That would be your tipping point :) BGeometrics Conclusion Similar to equity investing, I never recommend FOMO-ing into anything. A measured approach to portfolio allocation should be a prime directive, as well as dollar-cost-averaging into Altcoins when the time is right. Well, that’s my two Satoshis!",IBIT|GBTC|ARKB|BITB|BTCO|HODL|BRRR|EZBC|BTCW|SOL-USD|ETH|ETHE|ETH-USD|BTC-USD,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-04-22 11:30:00

But while Ethereum lays the track, an ETH-based newcomer, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is gaining serious traction behind the scenes. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently priced at just $0.025 in Phase 4 of its presale. The platform’s unique dual-lending model, combining peer-to-peer and peer-to-contract mechanisms, offers flexibility and efficiency in crypto lending. As this phase concludes, the price is set to rise to $0.03 in Phase 5. Since launch, the project has attracted over 8,400 investors and secured $7 million in funding. This rising star is attracting early investors with predictions soaring as high as $6 by Q3 2025. As ETH revs up for its next rally, many believe MUTM could be the real breakout story riding the Ethereum wave. The Mutuum Finance team has just introduced a new dashboard featuring a leaderboard that highlights the top 50 holders, who will earn bonus tokens for maintaining their position in the top 50. Mutuum Finance: Shaping the Next Generation of DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance attracts major investor interest through its unique method of decentralized financing. Users can benefit from the combined Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) framework which creates a dual-lending system that provides users with adaptive control together with improved efficiency. The lending process in P2C is managed by smart contracts which accept USDT in liquidity pools while providing loan backing through ETH. The P2P model gives users complete control over their loan management which provides increased privacy alongside self-directed autonomy. Mutuum Finance provides a high-yield DeFi platform through its adaptive operations alongside liquidity provider returns exceeding 10% which makes it both profitable and easy to use. To drive further engagement, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway, awarding ten investors with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. This initiative not only incentivizes current users but also encourages community-driven expansion through referrals and increased participation. It’s a strategic move that fuels both platform visibility and organic user growth. Phase 4 Presale: A Timely Entry into a Promising DeFi Project Early-stage investors now have a limited-time chance to acquire MUTM tokens at just $0.025 in the ongoing Phase 4 of the presale. As the token is expected to climb incrementally to $0.06 by the final phase, current participants could realize returns of up to 140% even before the token hits the open market. With a growing ecosystem and expert projections pointing to a potential post-launch price of $2, MUTM is being positioned as one of 2025’s breakout DeFi projects. The presale has already generated over $7 million in market cap, a strong signal of investor faith and long-term potential. As Ethereum inches closer to a potential $2,000 rally, Mutuum Finance is emerging as the sleeper pick riding that same wave, but with significantly higher upside. Backed by over $7 million in presale funding and supported by 8,400+ early investors, MUTM is leveraging Ethereum’s infrastructure to power a next-gen DeFi platform with real yield and real utility. With the token currently priced at $0.025 and forecasts climbing as high as $6 by Q3 2025, the current presale phase offers a strategic entry point. The platform’s innovative dual-lending system promises flexibility and security, making it highly appealing for long-term investors. Position yourself early and secure MUTM tokens now and ride the next major ETH-based breakout.

The news was highlighted by crypto enthusiast Brett, who noted the extraordinary spike as a sign of deepening whale involvement in XRP’s trading ecosystem. Whale Activity Signals Renewed Confidence Massive volume spikes of this nature are often driven by institutional players or high-net-worth individuals— commonly referred to as “whales” —executing large buy or sell orders in short bursts. The $20 million transaction volume within 60 seconds is not only a statistical anomaly but also a strong indicator that significant players are positioning themselves in the XRP market. Whales are taking over! $XRP trading volume just exceeded 20 million in a single minute. You see this? This is real utility. pic.twitter.com/YofRSjdRGW — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) April 21, 2025 This kind of activity suggests that whales are either accumulating XRP in anticipation of bullish developments or rotating liquidity into the asset to capitalize on upcoming catalysts. Whether it’s speculation surrounding an XRP ETF, potential Federal Reserve integrations, or growing adoption across payment corridors, whales appear to be aligning their portfolios accordingly. Real Utility, Not Just Hype Brett emphasized that this explosive trading moment isn’t merely speculative—it reflects real-world utility. Unlike many altcoins that rely heavily on hype cycles, XRP has carved out a functional role in cross-border payments, stablecoin infrastructure, and bank-grade blockchain solutions. This one-minute surge in volume may be emblematic of a broader shift toward XRP’s embedded use cases being more widely recognized and acted upon by large entities. Ripple’s growing global footprint through partnerships with banks, fintechs, and central banks lends credibility to the notion that XRP’s utility is no longer theoretical. As blockchain becomes increasingly integrated into traditional finance, XRP’s low-cost, high-speed settlement features are positioning it as a critical player in the digital payment revolution. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Implications for XRP Price and Sentiment While price reactions to volume spikes can be volatile and mixed in the short term, historically, sustained whale activity has led to sharp rallies or pivotal market trend reversals. Traders and analysts will be watching closely to see if this volume anomaly becomes part of a larger pattern that pushes XRP out of consolidation and into a more bullish structure. Furthermore, on-chain data platforms may soon confirm whether this surge originated from centralized exchanges, decentralized platforms, or custodial movements—each scenario offering different insights into the motives behind the move. A Moment to Watch For now, the $20 million one-minute milestone serves as a striking reminder of the liquidity and institutional interest surrounding XRP. As Brett puts it, “You see this? This is real utility.” And if the trend continues, it may well mark the early stages of a new chapter in XRP’s market dominance.

Over the past week, its price has jumped nearly 25%, going from $1.86 to around $2.32 . But this quick surge is just part of a much bigger picture. Several signs are pointing to something much bigger on the horizon for this rising Sui token. Sui Stablecoin Inflows Hit Record High SUI was once seen as one of the worst-performing assets this year, with its price falling nearly 60% since January. But things started to change in March and April, as the token began showing signs of a strong comeback. In the last week alone, the SUI network saw a major jump in stablecoin activity. Around $60 million worth of stablecoins flowed into the network in just 24 hours, marking a new record. This surge has now placed SUI among the top blockchain networks when it comes to stablecoin inflows, even outpacing giants like Ethereum and Solana. SUI Showing Strong Bullish Signals Adding even more excitement, popular crypto analyst Raoul Pal has shared a very bullish outlook for the token. Looking at the SUI’s 1-day price chart, Pal believes the coin is close to breaking out of a downward trend and may be ready for a strong rally. Sui – Knock knocking knocking on heavens door… $SUI pic.twitter.com/LbBiYzRzNR — Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) April 21, 2025 Supporting this view, another well-known crypto trader, Capital Faibik, points to a “falling wedge” pattern forming on SUI’s chart. This pattern often signals a breakout, and if that happens, he believes the price could surge to around $4.80. Big Prediction: SUI to $10? But the most eye-catching prediction comes from investment giant VanEck. The firm, which manages over $116 billion in assets, says SUI could rise by more than 350% and hit $10 by the end of 2025. This prediction seems more likely now, as Canary Capital Funds has just filed for the first-ever SUI token ETF. This move could attract institutional investors, which usually helps the asset grow in the long term. SUI Price Analysis As of now, SUI is currently trading at $2.32, showing a 1.5% increase in the last 24 hours, with the market cap reaching $7.5 billion. Looking at the charts, it’s clear that the bulls are in control. The RSI has jumped from 48 to 68 , indicating renewed buying activity. Plus, the MACD has turned bullish, showing that the trend could continue its upward trajectory. The token recently broke past a critical resistance at $2.25, a level that now offers solid support.

Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain flagged the wallet address of a whale that staked nearly 1 million Solana ( SOL ) tokens in 2021. At the time of the staking, Solana tokens were worth around $27, which means the trader spent about $27 million to execute the play. Four years later, the whale’s total staked Solana holdings have reached 1.29 million. With Solana appreciating to about $140, the whale’s holdings have increased in value to about $180 million. On April 22, the whale started offloading a portion of the token stash to cash out on the gains. Lookonchain reported that the whale had unstaked 100,000 SOL tokens (about $14 million) and sent them to Binance. Sending tokens to crypto exchanges often indicates an intent to sell. Lookonchain said the whale still has 1.19 million Solana, worth around $166 million. Since the trader spent $27 million on the play, the total unrealized profit for the address is about $153 million. Source: Lookonchain Solana whales turn $37 million to $200 million in four-year play The Solana whale’s unstaking and token offloading follow another Solana staking play that involved hundreds of millions earlier in April. On April 4, Arkham Intelligence data showed four wallets that staked $37 million in tokens in 2021 had their tokens unlocked, meaning they can unstake and sell them. The blockchain intelligence platform called the event “the largest single-day unlock of staked SOL.” During the unlock, the tokens were worth over $206 million. After the tokens were unlocked, about $50 million in tokens were sold.

On April 20, the blockchain overtook Ethereum in staked token value after reaching over $53 billion. Still, the event was short-lived as Ethereum recovered the top spot. While the event may seem bullish, community members were split on whether Solana overtaking Ethereum was bullish or bearish for the network .

However, buyers appear hesitant to place huge bets; a key barrier to getting to $90,000. At the same time, investors are shifting their focus to attractive opportunities beyond the majors. Bitcoin Pepe , a fresh project tied to the Bitcoin network is benefiting from this trend. Besides, meme lovers are hooked on its one-of-a-kind mission to “bring the meme culture back home”. Bitcoin price faces key hurdle to the coveted zone of $90,000 Bitcoin has emerged as a top performer among the crypto majors; an aspect that may attract more buyers from the sidelines. Amidst the turmoil in the financial markets, investors are increasingly seeking Bitcoin’s stability. An improvement of the market sentiment has further boosted Bitcoin price. Compared to last week’s fear level of 31, the crypto fear & greed index was at 39 on Tuesday. However, as the risk-off mood persists, the bulls lack enough momentum to break the resistance at $89,075. This is the main barrier to getting to the coveted zone of $90,000. On the lower side, the support level of $83,092 will likely remain steady in the short term.

In addition to its infrastructure, this interest has positioned Bitcoin Pepe on the list of top meme ICOs to watch out for in 2025. As the world’s first Bitcoin meme ICO, the project seeks to bring the ultra-popular meme culture to the stable Bitcoin network. Its new PEP-20 token standard allows one to easily launch a memecoin on BTC; an aspect that has attracted a large number of crypto enthusiasts. Besides, with the Layer-2 solution, investors get to enjoy Bitcoin’s stability as well as Solana-style transaction speed, and lower fees. Its attractiveness has seen it raise over $6.8 million since the start of its presale in February. With its launch slated for Q2, BPEP tokens are worth buying at the currently affordable price of $0.031. The early adopters have already secured 40.5% in cumulative gains. At the end of the 30 stages, they will have amassed 311.4% gains. Besides, based on its infrastructure and virality, the token has the potential to reach 100X growth in the foreseeable future.

Ethereum fails to catch up with Bitcoin’s recovery as investor activity drops Ethereum, the leading altcoin, has been struggling to recover as its internal challenges and macroeconomic uncertainties weigh on the cryptocurrency market. Ordinarily, the asset’s price moves in tandem with that of the top crypto, Bitcoin. However, while Bitcoin price has recorded significant gains since the beginning of the week, Ethereum price continues to trade below its short and medium-term MAs. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin price has rallied by 1.32% over the past 24 hours while Ethereum has dropped by 0.82% during the same timeframe. Similarly, BTC spot ETFs reported daily net inflows of $381.40 million on Monday compared to ETH spot ETFs’ outflows of $25.42 million. In the near term, the range between $1,515 and $1,750 will be worth watching. For as long as the crypto remains below the 50-day EMA at $1,882, the bears are still in control.

The numbers showcase the effectiveness of airdrops as a marketing instrument that crypto projects can leverage to attract new audiences and bootstrap engagement. The report also highlights the importance of ongoing structural shifts taking place in the industry across regions, as well as user motivation swings. Key Takeaways: Peak user acquisition rates driven by airdrops reach up to 35% in certain months. User behavior is influencing airdrop campaign participation through deeper mobile penetration and the involvement of gamification mechanisms. 76% of users who sign up via airdrop campaigns remain on the platform , with 18% becoming active traders and 58% trading occasionally. The CIS region leads in terms of involvement at 67% , followed by Southeast Asia at 51%, and South Asia at 32%. Airdrops are evolving into a means of financial inclusion, in addition to acting as an effective marketing instrument. MEXC analyzed user behavior during airdrop campaigns and identified a significant shift in the audience. While regions with low levels of access to banking services previously served as the main source of airdrop participants, the latest report indicates that new channels of user onboarding are ousting the trend. Gamification and Tap-to-Earn games in mobile-based Telegram channels are taking center stage as key registration sources for users with no previous experience in crypto. For instance, games like Hamster Kombat attracted over 70 million users, other notable examples of similar grade being Notcoin and Yescoin. According to the data compiled as a result of the research, users who received their first airdrop tokens demonstrated varying degrees of continued involvement in the crypto industry. As many as 18% maintained active trading patterns and delved deeper into crypto services, 58% traded occasionally, while 24% were one-off users, withdrawing their funds without further engagement in trading. The users who evolve into active traders showcase an average daily trading volume above $58,000, with select ones achieving $31 million. Regional segmentation of the users attracted via airdrops shows that the CIS is in a leading position, with 67% of the total, followed by Southeast Asia at 51%, and South Asia with 32%. The results of the analysis correlate with low levels of access to banking services in the given regions. They also align with data provided by Chainalysis, which positioned India, Vietnam, and the Philippines as the countries in Asia with the highest rates of crypto adoption, driven by low levels of banking services access and rapid spread of internet coverage in rural areas. The limited financial inclusion of the countries in the indicated regions into the international banking system paves the way for cryptocurrencies to act as alternative means of payment both abroad and within domestic economies. Users participating in airdrops either withdraw them to fiat or use them for their needs. Pakistan and the Philippines are leading in this regard. The report released by MEXC highlights the prominent role airdrops are occupying in the evolving crypto landscape, transforming from a marketing action into a separate instrument for user engagement. The ability to attract 35% new user registrations via airdrops in select regions like the CIS and Asia is a powerful factor acting in favor of using the given approach to expanding the crypto industry and advancing its maturity. About MEXC Founded in 2018, MEXC is committed to being “Your Easiest Way to Crypto.” Serving over 36 million users across 170+ countries, MEXC is known for its broad selection of trending tokens, everyday airdrop opportunities, and low trading fees.

The revelation adds a new meaning to the series of pro-crypto moves under the Trump administration. According to FEC data, crypto donors accounted for a significant portion of the $245.27 million donated to Trump’s inauguration fund after the last presidential election. Ripple, the issuer of XRP, was the biggest donor with $4.9 million, which was more than every other company except multinational food producer Pilgrim’s, which donated $5 million. Crypto donors to Trump inauguration (Source: Fortune) Beyond Ripple, retail trading platform Robinhood was the next biggest crypto donor with $2 million. However, several other firms, including crypto exchanges Coinbase, Kraken, and Crypto.com, stablecoin issuer Circle, Solana Labs, crypto venture capital firm Galaxy Digital , and tokenization platform Ondo Finance, donated $1 million each. Cardano’s Input Output Global also donated $250,000, while Bored Ape’s Yuga Labs and Consensys donated $100,000 each. Interestingly, individuals, including Uniswap CEO Hayden Adams, Multicoin Capital co-founder Kyle Samani, Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla, and Coinbase and Paradigm co-founder Fredrick Ernest Ehrsam III, also donated significantly to the fund. US pro-crypto moves favor Trump donors The massive donation to the inauguration fund adds to the millions that the crypto industry had initially spent on the 2024 election. Per multiple reports, the industry was the biggest corporate spender in the election, with $134 million spent through political action committees (PACs) that supported pro-crypto candidates, including Trump. While the Trump administration has lived up to some of the promises made during the campaign run, the new FEC report shows that the pro-crypto moves might have been more beneficial to companies that donated to Trump’s inauguration fund. A quick scan shows that almost all the companies that donated to Trump’s inauguration have already benefited from the administration’s policy switch. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Trump has already dropped lawsuits and investigations against several of the donor companies, including Kraken, Uniswap, Consensys, Coinbase, Ripple, and Crypto.com. Interestingly, the Digital Assets Stockpile that Trump created also included Ripple XRP, Solana SOL, and Cardano ADA. The move attracted criticisms when it was initially announced, as many did not expect these tokens to be part of the reserve. Even crypto VC firms that donated to Trump’s inauguration have also received some recognition from the White House, with Paradigm and Multicoin Capital invited to the Crypto Summit, while other major organizations, such as the Ethereum Foundation, did not receive an invitation. Critics claim Trump’s pro-crypto moves is self-serving However, Trump himself might be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the crypto policy switch. According to a Forbes report, the President’s net worth has doubled in the past year due to his crypto affiliations and Truth Social. Key among these affiliations is the World Liberty Financial (WLFI) DeFi project and the TRUMP memecoin launched a few days before his inauguration. Trump’s affiliation with these projects attracted massive liquidity to them, and the SEC guidance on memecoins and stablecoins effectively benefits both WLFI and the TRUMP memecoin. Unsurprisingly, critics have expressed concerns about Trump’s crypto presidency. Former SEC official John Reed Stark and Duke University professor Lee Reiners recently published an op-ed in The New York Times, claiming that President Trump has stopped the SEC from regulating crypto. They claim that the permissive environment for crypto under the Trump administration could have disastrous effects for investors and even affect traditional financial markets as the two become more connected.

Triple bottom in altcoin market cap hints at upcoming rally,https://crypto.news/altseason-brewing-triple-bottom-in-altcoin-market-cap-hints-at-upcoming-rally/,"As Bitcoin kicks off the week with renewed strength, climbing past $88,500 — it’s highest point since March 25, speculation is growing that an altcoin season may be just around the corner A recent X post by a well-known analyst Miles Deutscher has reignited the excitement about the upcoming altcoin season, highlighting two technical developments that may give rise to major altcoin rallies in the coming weeks. First, Deutscher highlighted a stark divergence between Bitcoin ( BTC ) and U.S. equities. While the S&P 500 has trended lower in recent weeks, weighed down by macroeconomic uncertainty and trade tensions, Bitcoin has moved decisively higher — up over 3% on Monday alone and continuing to climb past $88,500 today. Source: @milesdeutscher This divergence comes as gold recently surged to a new all-time high, briefly touching $3,500 before pulling back to $3,455 at press time. Historically, strong performance in gold precedes upward moves in BTC, reinforcing the idea that BTC may once again be viewed as a safe-haven alternative . You might also like: Gold hits new ATH at $3,390, is Bitcoin close behind? This combination of BTC breaking away from equities and reestablishing its correlation with gold is laying a foundation for altcoin resurgence, as BTC rallies often set the stage for altseason . The case is further strengthened by Deutscher’s second observation that the altcoin market cap appears to have formed a triple bottom — a bullish pattern where prices test and rebound from the same support level three times, signaling a potential trend reversal. Source: @milesdeutscher At the same time, institutional confidence in BTC appears to be increasing. U.S.-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds recently posted their highest daily inflows in three months, driven by a resurgence in risk-on sentiment following Trump’s renewed threats to dismiss Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Additionally, stablecoins — a proxy for crypto liquidity — have seen significant growth over the past eight months, with Tether’s ( USDT ) market cap growing 26% and USD Coin’s ( USDC ) market cap surging 93% over the same period. This suggests that capital is continuing to flow into crypto despite the ongoing trade tensions. Still, some analysts remain skeptical about an imminent altseason. Matrixport recently pointed to the lack of dovish Fed policy and Ethereum’s declining dominance as factors that continue to dampen sustained interest in altcoins. So, if altseason is indeed on horizon, it’ll likely to take a while to materialize. The CoinMarketCap Altcoin Season Index is currently sitting at just 16 — well below the 75 threshold that typically signals altcoin season is underway.

Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal called the Oregon action a “copycat,” warning it could “hinder ongoing bipartisan efforts in Congress” to pass national crypto rules.

Burwick Law, the New York-based firm, known for championing investor rights in the crypto space, argues that Metaplex’s plan is not only ethically questionable but also potentially illegal. reminder that there's 3 days left until @metaplex rugs users of 54k sol (~$7.5M) metadata accounts for 23.5M NFTs are getting resized and MP is using this opportunity to steal users prepaid rent fees you can use @solincinerator to reclaim your sol until the 25th https://t.co/ovS9Ua5nG9 pic.twitter.com/RmvG5Zp5WY — ultra (@0x_ultra) April 22, 2025 The controversy centers on “resize rent,” a small amount of SOL paid by users during NFT minting to fund on-chain storage. Following a technical upgrade that allowed NFT metadata accounts to shrink in size, excess rent has remained dormant in these program accounts, unclaimed by users who were either unaware of the funds or never received adequate instructions on how to retrieve them. Metaplex now plans to transfer these funds to its treasury, ostensibly for community use such as airdrops and grants. Legal and Ethical Storm Brewing Over Unclaimed Rent In an open letter addressed to Metaplex and the broader Solana developer community, Burwick Law warned that forcibly relocating user-funded rent into a DAO-controlled treasury could amount to unjust enrichment, conversion, or even violations of consumer protection laws. **An Open Letter to @metaplex and Solana Industry Leaders** The Metaplex SOL Sweep: Why User Rent Should Flow Back to the Community, Not a DAO Treasury On April 25, 2025, the Metaplex protocol plans to relocate about 54,000 SOL in “unclaimed resize rent” from user‑funded… — Burwick Law (@BurwickLaw) April 22, 2025 The firm, which represents thousands of NFT investors, drew parallels between this case and traditional banking lawsuits in which undisclosed overdraft fees were later refunded to customers through class action settlements. According to Burwick, this precedent suggests that NFT users may be entitled to restitution if Metaplex proceeds with its sweep without offering a refund mechanism. Rather than invoking legal warfare, Burwick proposed a pause on the sweep and instead issue refunds directly to current NFT holders via a simple on-chain program upgrade. The firm suggested a 90/10 split, where the vast majority of the rent is returned to users, and a small portion, approximately 10%, is retained by the DAO as a “network maintenance bounty.” This solution, Burwick argued, would show that the Solana ecosystem is capable of self-regulating in line with Web3’s founding principles of transparency and fair dealing. As of now, Metaplex has not publicly responded to Burwick Law’s concerns. The DAO has previously stated that reclaimed SOL would be used to benefit the broader community. Legal Tensions and Industry Uncertainty Deepen Amid NFT Market Turbulence The Metaplex drama is unfolding against a backdrop of increasing volatility in the NFT sector. Just last month, Watch Skins Corporation filed a federal lawsuit against luxury conglomerate LVMH , accusing its watch brand TAG Heuer of infringing on patented NFT display technology. A company specializing in smartwatch face designs sold through NFTs has filed a lawsuit against LVMH, alleging patent infringement. #LVMH #NFT https://t.co/lhMU8pT82o — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 12, 2025 Watch Skins claims its innovation enables smartwatches to display verified NFT art and alleges that TAG Heuer encouraged customers to infringe upon these patents. Meanwhile, trading volumes in the NFT market have nosedived. February saw a 60% drop in NFT trading activity compared to earlier months , despite a brief resurgence in late 2024. According to DappRadar and CryptoSlam, total NFT sales for 2024 reached $8.83 billion, just a fraction of the $23.7 billion peak seen in 2022. Solana, which ranks third behind Ethereum and Bitcoin in total NFT sales, generated $1.4 billion, showing its growing yet fragile influence in the space. The current uncertainty is further exacerbated by the fallout from Bybit’s security breach earlier this year. The exchange, which lost nearly $1.5 billion to a North Korean cyberattack, recently announced the shutdown of its NFT and IDO platforms . @Bybit_Official shuts down NFT and IDO platforms after a $1.5B security breach, reflecting industry trends and strategic shifts amid declining trading volumes and heightened security concerns. #Crypto #NFTs https://t.co/QKghreYJu3 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 1, 2025 Though the company attributed the closures to a desire to streamline offerings, the timing suggests that ongoing security, legal, and trust issues are prompting major players to reevaluate their NFT strategies.

In an appearance on Bloomberg Crypto, Thorn says that in addition to the Bitcoin the US government holds from confiscations, the world’s largest economy will purchase BTC to add to the SBR in 2025. “In March, they had the establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the United States Digital Asset Stockpile Executive Order… …which specifically prohibited the government from selling Bitcoin and ordered the [Departments of] Commerce and Treasury to find out budget-neutral ways to buy Bitcoin while simultaneously prohibiting them from buying altcoins and leaving the management up to those departments for altcoins. I think a lot of progress has been made… And you’ve got Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent literally saying Bitcoin is now becoming a store of value. You’ve got a drumbeat from Bo Hines [Executive Director of the President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets] and David Sachs [White House AI and crypto czar]. And it just seems plausible at this point, they will buy something. There will be a buy.” On how the US government would purchase Bitcoin in budget-neutral ways for the SBR, the Galaxy Digital head of research says, “What you could do is the altcoins that are in the sell-only digital asset stockpile, you could sell some of those for Bitcoin… To be specific, you could sell an altcoin in an altcoin/BTC pair and never touch cash at all. No cash ever has to flow into the [US] general treasury. Could be an easier way to get to a ‘promises made, promises kept’ on the SBR.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Investors pulled $146 million out of the market in response, contributing significantly to the week’s subdued overall net flow. The United States bore the brunt of these outflows, with $71 million withdrawn. In stark contrast, Europe and Canada saw a net inflow of $75.4 million, with Switzerland leading at $43.7 million, followed by Germany with $22.3 million and Canada with $9.4 million. Bitcoin also concluded the week with minor outflows of $6 million, following fluctuating investor behavior throughout the period. Even short-Bitcoin products, which typically serve as a hedge, recorded $1.2 million in outflows. This marks the seventh straight week of negative flows into these short products, which have now seen a cumulative $36 million in outflows, representing nearly 40% of their total assets under management. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s prolonged struggle persisted. With another $26.7 million in outflows last week, Ethereum’s eight-week downturn now totals a staggering $772 million in capital flight. Despite this, Ethereum still retains a positive position on a year-to-date basis with $215 million in net inflows. XRP: Surging Inflows, Spiking Activity, and Futures Debut Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP has weathered the recent market turbulence and thrived. With inflows of $37.7 million last week, XRP emerged as the top performer among digital asset investment products, making it the third most successful asset year-to-date, with $214 million in net inflows. This strong interest in capital coincides with a remarkable resurgence in network activity. On April 21, on-chain analyst Ali Martinez reported that the number of active XRP addresses surged by 67.5% in just one day, rising from 27,352 to 40,366. $XRP network activity jumped 67.50%, with active addresses rising from 27,352 to 40,366! pic.twitter.com/fDiERMIYiz — Ali (@ali_charts) April 21, 2025 Martinez also pointed to an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern forming on XRP’s chart. This traditionally bullish technical indicator could push the asset’s price to $2.70, representing a 30% increase from current levels. Further amplifying the bullish case for XRP was a major regulatory and institutional development. Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the U.S., received approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to launch XRP futures contracts. Coinbase Derivatives, LLC now offers CFTC-regulated futures for $XRP . https://t.co/omSNu0aEoC — Coinbase Institutional (@CoinbaseInsto) April 21, 2025 The new product, offered through Coinbase Derivatives LLC, went live on April 21. For XRP, the timing couldn’t be more opportune. Following the legal clarity achieved in Ripple’s long-running lawsuit with the SEC, XRP now boasts high liquidity, a large global user base, and broad exchange availability. Yet, the price of XRP experienced a minor 0.59% dip over the past 24 hours, likely reflecting the wider market’s consolidation rather than a direct reaction to the futures launch. Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s Behavior Shifts Amid Macro Turbulence While XRP captured headlines, Bitcoin’s recent price behavior suggests a more profound transformation is underway. According to Nansen CEO Alex Svanevik, Bitcoin is beginning to trade less like a tech stock and more like a traditional safe-haven asset, namely, gold. BTC started acting like gold two weeks ago.

The asset’s resilience amid inflationary pressures and global trade disputes lends credence to its evolving role as digital gold.

Yet, the Web3 gaming sector tells a different story—struggling to reclaim its post-COVID boom, with 2024 erasing over $20 billion from its niche market. Web3 gaming sector struggles to sustain investors’ interest/ Source: CoinMarketCap Over the past 30 days, the GameFi niche has slipped another 9%. Despite this broader pullback, the total crypto gaming market cap still holds above $11 billion, and standout tokens like Pixel are showing resilience, posting a 37% surge in the last 24 hours. $PIXEL Sees Uptick in Gamers’ Activity and Interest Launched in 2021, Pixels ($PIXEL) is a social gaming platform initially developed on the Polygon blockchain before migrating to the Ronin Network. The $PIXEL token is used within its gaming ecosystem to buy upgrades, cosmetics, and other items that enhance the player experience. Unlike many blockchain games, $PIXEL has achieved remarkable engagement. In May 2024, it recorded over 1.03 million daily active addresses and players. Pixel active user addresses surpass 1 million UAW/ Source: DappRadar Although currently down about 70% from its 2024 peak, $PIXEL has seen a 14% increase in unique active wallets over the past 24 hours, resulting in more than 40,000 transactions during the same period. A major factor in $PIXEL’s sustained growth has been its transition to the Ronin blockchain. According to the project founder, Luke Barwikowski, Ronin offered a ready-made audience thanks to its ties with Axie Infinity, dramatically reducing user acquisition friction. In a past interview, Barwikowski also emphasized the significance of $PIXEL’s February 2024 Binance listing, calling it a milestone that took three years to achieve.

Pixel-based Ronin network saw a 40% YTD decline/ Source: DappRadar As a result, $PIXEL’s valuation has declined dramatically, slipping from over $1 billion to just $130 million. $PIXEL/$USDT Technical Indicators Point to Potential Reversal The $PIXEL/$USDT chart currently shows signs of a potential bearish reversal following a strong price rally. After climbing to a local high near $0.050, the asset exhibits signs of structural weakness, including a developing Head and Shoulders pattern on the one-hour chart. $PIXEL poses structural weakness following a Head & Shoulders pattern formation/ source: TradingView The neckline of this pattern lies around the $0.042 level. A confirmed breakdown below this area could prompt further retracement, potentially toward the $0.034–$0.032 support zone, aligned with earlier consolidation areas and Fibonacci retracement levels. Recent candles show long upper wicks and smaller bearish bodies, adding to the narrative of fading buying pressure. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has also fallen to around 54.03 after previously entering the overbought zone above 70, another signal of slowing momentum. Fibonacci extension levels cluster between $0.037 and $0.041, and if the head-and-shoulders pattern plays out, the price could drop toward the 1.618 extension at $0.03713 or even as far as the 2.618 extension at $0.03897. If selling pressure increases, a move to the lower Fibonacci targets near $0.035–$0.032 would not be unexpected.

TD Cowen Says Strategy Bitcoin Buying Frenzy Has Minimal Impact on Prices Despite its growing footprint as a major institutional Bitcoin (BTC) holder, Strategy’s large-scale cryptocurrency purchases appear to have little impact on its price, according to a research report by TD Cowen. The published findings challenge a popular theory among skeptics: that Strategy’s aggressive buying spree helped support Bitcoin’s value and that prices would fall without continued demand. But analysts said that argument didn’t carry much weight based on the data. A Big Buyer, But a Small Slice of the Market Strategy recently issued an additional 1.8 million shares in an at-the-market (ATM) offering, raising an additional $842 million in net proceeds. The funds were used to purchase 6,556 Bitcoin, increasing the firm’s Bitcoin return for the quarter by 1% to 12.1%. However, when measured against the broader Bitcoin market, these purchases are just a drop in the bucket. Strategy’s Bitcoin purchases typically account for just 3.3% of weekly trading volume on average, according to TD Cowen analysis. Over the past 27 weeks, the company’s total activity has reached 8.4% of volume. But that figure was skewed by a handful of weeks when its purchases briefly exceeded 20%. In eight of those weeks, Strategy did not buy any Bitcoin at all. “Our conclusion is that it does not appear plausible that Strategy’s purchases could have a sustained and significant impact on the price of Bitcoin over most periods,” TD Cowen analysts wrote. *This is not investment advice.

Is a Major Price Shift Incoming?,https://timestabloid.com/29-5-million-xrp-moved-to-coinbase-hot-wallet-is-a-major-price-shift-incoming/,"A significant on-chain movement involving XRP has caught the attention of crypto watchers, igniting fresh speculation about potential price action. According to blockchain observer Xaif , over 29.5 million XRP tokens were recently transferred from Coinbase Institutional’s cold wallet to its hot wallet—an event that may signal a major injection of liquidity into the market. 💥BREAKING:💥 Over 29.5M $XRP transferred from Coinbase Institutional (Cold Wallet) to Coinbase Hot Wallet — major liquidity injection possibly signaling upcoming XRP movement. #XRP pic.twitter.com/onXHHm3TQU — 𝕏aif🇮🇳|🇺🇸 (@Xaif_Crypto) April 21, 2025 Liquidity Shift Raises Eyebrows This large-scale token migration , amounting to tens of millions of dollars, suggests that Coinbase may be preparing to facilitate immediate XRP-related activity. Cold wallets, typically used for secure long-term storage, are not directly connected to the internet and rarely see sudden movements unless a deliberate change in strategy or operations is underway. On the other hand, hot wallets are connected and ready for instant transactional use, whether for trading, withdrawals, or internal liquidity support. The shift of 29.5 million XRP to a hot wallet implies a readiness to engage in market activity, either to meet anticipated user demand or to support upcoming trading opportunities. While the exchange hasn’t issued a public statement regarding the transfer, the movement itself is seen as a notable event that could precede an increase in XRP price volatility. Timing and Market Implications This development comes amid a surge of institutional interest in XRP, bolstered by growing optimism around exchange-traded fund (ETF) discussions, regulatory clarity following the Ripple vs. SEC court decisions , and speculation surrounding potential partnerships between Ripple and major financial systems. Moving such a substantial quantity of XRP to a hot wallet right now may not be coincidental. It often indicates preparatory steps taken by the exchange to support upcoming spikes in trading activity or to accommodate large buyers. Such movements have historically preceded notable rallies or selloffs, depending on the broader market context. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additionally, this liquidity maneuver may also align with other bullish signals surrounding the XRP ecosystem, including increasing network activity, partnerships, and stablecoin developments. If this transfer is indeed connected to a broader institutional play or market event, XRP could soon experience elevated trading volumes and price movement. Looking Ahead Market participants are now watching closely for follow-up signals, including sudden surges in trading volume on Coinbase or other exchanges, as well as price breakouts on technical charts. While a single wallet movement is not definitive proof of an impending rally, it often serves as a key puzzle piece in a broader trend. As noted by Xaif, the scale and destination of this transfer make it one of the more intriguing XRP-related events in recent days. Whether it results in a significant market shift remains to be seen, but for now, all eyes are on Coinbase and XRP’s price charts.

This divergence in price movements has sparked discussions among crypto analysts regarding the potential future trajectory of Ethereum, particularly in light of Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. Ethereum Bull Run Potential Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently shared insights on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), suggesting that Ethereum could ignite a new bull run if it manages to breach the critical resistance level at $2,330. Martinez emphasized that a breakout above this supply wall could signal renewed investor interest and push ETH towards significantly higher prices. However, Ethereum has been trapped in a narrow range between $1,500 and $1,650 for the past week, lacking any substantial catalysts to spur an upward movement. Related Reading: Dogecoin Stalls After 42 Days Of Flat Price Action — Is A Breakdown Coming? The immediate focus for Ethereum bulls is the $1,600 level, which has emerged as a near-term resistance point. Market expert TedPillows highlighted that Ethereum has recently broken out of a downtrend for the first time since February 2025, indicating a potential shift in market sentiment. If ETH can hold above the $1,600 threshold, analysts speculate it could rally towards the $2,000 mark by April. Conversely, some analysts, including Crypto Fella, warn of the risks associated with Ethereum’s current stagnation. The importance of a swift upward movement; a failure to break through the nearest resistance could result in a drop towards $1,200, highlighting the precarious nature of the altcoin’s current position. Bitcoin Surges Past $87,000 In stark contrast, Bitcoin’s market performance paints a different picture. The cryptocurrency’s recent surge above $87,000 is interpreted by Nicholas Roberts-Huntley, CEO of Concrete and Glow Finance, as a clear indication that investors are seeking refuge in decentralized assets amidst rising tariffs, inflation concerns, and global economic uncertainty. This sentiment is echoed as the crypto market reacts to political tensions, particularly surrounding President Trump’s threats to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not expediting interest rate cuts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Surges Above $87,000 In Sudden Move — Here’s The Catalyst Youwei Yang, chief economist at Bitcoin mining company BIT Mining, provided further context on Bitcoin’s behavior in the current economic climate. Yang noted that while Bitcoin may initially respond like a risk asset—similar to tech stocks—during times of crisis, it tends to stabilize and exhibit characteristics of a safe haven asset akin to gold as market conditions improve. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,584, posting losses of over 3% in the weekly time frame.

43666626,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=713618,1745323257,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43666626.jpeg,"Reserve Bank of India to inject $35 billion into the economy, boost credit growth by 2%",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/reserve-bank-of-india-35b-into-the-economy/,"The Reserve Bank of India said Monday it will unlock up to 3 trillion rupees—that’s $35.24 billion—from the banking system by loosening rules on liquidity coverage. This change will let banks lend more money and possibly push credit growth up by as much as 2 percentage points, while also giving Indian banks more breathing room at a time when loan growth has slowed for eight straight months, according to a report from Reuters. The central bank cut the percentage of high-quality liquid assets banks must keep tied to digitally connected deposits. These assets include things like cash, central bank balances, and federal bonds. The RBI expects this to bump the average liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) across banks by 6 percentage points by the end of December. This means banks can now do more with their money instead of letting it sit around just to meet regulatory limits. RBI reduces liquidity buffer and delays rollout Anil Gupta, who runs financial sector ratings at ICRA, said the system’s total HQLA sits between 45 trillion and 50 trillion rupees. After the changes, banks will have an extra 2.7 to 3 trillion rupees ready to lend out. Anil said this unlocks the ability to grow credit by 1.4 to 1.5 percentage points, which might sound small until you zoom out and look at how tight things have been lately. Macquarie also ran its own numbers. It pegged the added liquidity between 2.5 and 3 trillion rupees, pointing to the same credit boost range. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley put their projection between 1 and 2 percentage points of extra loan growth, and they think some of that impact will hit this year’s earnings reports. Morgan Stanley said most banks are already holding LCR ratios of 115% to 130%, even though the minimum requirement is just 100%, so the wiggle room is already built in. The new liquidity rule was originally supposed to kick in earlier, but the RBI delayed the start to April 1, 2026. That’s a full year later than they first said. The RBI explained that every bank in the country will still meet the minimum rules even with the delay, so there’s no concern about anyone falling short. India’s loan growth slows as liquidity changes arrive The decision comes while the entire banking sector has been dealing with a loan slowdown. Credit growth at Indian banks has cooled off every month since July last year, with February marking eight straight months of decline. The drop is serious enough that even HSBC slashed its estimate for credit growth last financial year from 12.5% to 11.5%. The RBI’s adjustment now tries to shove things back in the other direction. There’s also a bigger picture in play. On Monday, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with U.S. Vice President JD Vance in New Delhi. While Vance was in the country mostly for personal reasons with his wife Usha Vance and their family, he still sat down with Modi to talk trade and strategy. A statement from Modi’s office said both leaders welcomed what they called “significant progress” on a possible India-U.S. Bilateral Trade Agreement. They also looked at broader cooperation on things like energy, defense, and advanced tech. Both said they supported more dialogue and diplomacy to keep things moving forward in their relationship. Later that day, Jamieson Greer, who handles trade for the U.S. Trade Representative, said that India and America’s Commerce Ministry had agreed on a formal structure to guide talks on future trade deals. Greer said, “there is a serious lack of reciprocity in the trade relationship with India,” but still added that “India’s constructive engagement so far has been welcomed and I look forward to creating new opportunities for workers, farmers, and entrepreneurs in both countries.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

But while the world’s largest cryptocurrency gains momentum, seasoned investors are setting their sights on where the next wave of exponential growth will come from. The answer may not be in blue-chip tokens alone. In fact, some believe that early-stage opportunities like MAGACOINFINANCE could outperform everything else in the coming 12–18 months. PRESALE SELLING OUT – CLICK HERE TO SECURE A SPOT NOW MAGACOINFINANCE Is Drawing Major Retail Attention MAGACOINFINANCE gained immediate traction at launch, positioning it as one of the fastest-growing altcoin entries of the year. It wasn’t just hype—it was real demand, with wallet growth, pre-sale engagement, and community size all expanding at record speed. That growth has only continued. Now, new analyst models are excited for MAGACOINFINANCE , citing similarities to past breakout assets that gained mainstream attention only after early buyers had secured their positions. This forecast reflects the power of momentum. Early-stage metrics—including social reach, user onboarding, and liquidity depth—are all trending up. The structure is familiar: limited supply, expanding visibility, and a narrative that’s just beginning. It’s the type of profile seen in altcoins like Solana and XRP before their biggest runs. Where MAGACOINFINANCE Stands Against the 2025 Field XRP remains an institutional powerhouse, especially following recent regulatory wins. However, many analysts believe its growth curve has now matured. Solana is still one of the fastest chains in the ecosystem, but its price discovery is already far along. Polkadot remains a multichain leader, but its momentum has flattened since its early breakout days. Sei is showing promise but is still in early discovery. Against this backdrop, MAGACOINFINANCE is entering at exactly the right time. For investors looking to do more than just ride the next wave—those hoping to catch the next wave early—this may be one of the few remaining tokens that fits the criteria.

Incoming SEC Chair Faces 70 Crypto Filings,https://cryptonews.com/news/will-an-xrp-etf-send-prices-flying-incoming-sec-chair-faces-70-crypto-filings/,"The XRP price has dipped by 1.5% in the past 24 hours, dropping to $2.09 on a day when the crypto market has also suffered a 1.5% decline. XRP is now down by 2.5% in a week but up by 12% in a fortnight, with the altcoin also retaining an impressive 293% increase in the last 12 months. And while it has had a difficult couple of months (like the rest of the market), XRP is in a very strong position to recover, especially when incoming SEC Chair Paul Atkins has 10 XRP ETFs to review. Given that Ripple is now in the process of ending its long-running legal fight with the SEC, the odds of approval for these ETFs have risen considerably, and with it the odds of a big XRP rally later in the year. Will an XRP ETF Send Prices Flying? Incoming SEC Chair Faces 70 Crypto Filings Now that the Senate has confirmed his selection as the next SEC Chairman, the pro-crypto Paul Atkins will assume office in the imminent future, heralding a sea-change in the regulator’s stance towards the cryptocurrency market. The SEC is currently reviewing 72 applications for various crypto ETFs, and commentators such as Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas expect many of these to gain approval. There are now 72 crypto-related ETFs sitting with the SEC awaiting approval to list or list options. Everything from XRP, Litecoin and Solana to Penguins, Doge and 2x Melania and everything in between. Gonna be a wild year. Great roundup from @JSeyff pic.twitter.com/IHTqqxeH35 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) April 21, 2025 We’ve written before about how XRP has more pending ETF applications than any other altcoin, something which strengthens the bull case for the crypto massively. Of course, we may not see any approvals until the fall, but they highlight how the rest of the year could be incredibly positive for XRP. Indeed, now that the Ripple-SEC case is finally winding down , the company is able to grow more aggressively than in recent years, with speculation mounting that it could sign a partnership with international payment network SWIFT . And with the company already signing deals in relation to its stablecoin in recent months , it clearly has a head start in expanding. This positivity isn’t entirely evident in its chart today, which continues to show XRP in a weakened and somewhat conflicting position. Source: TradingView For example, its RSI (purple) has been mostly below 50 since the beginning of February, suggesting that a recovery is in order. Yet its 30-day average (orange) has been well above the 200-day (blue) since early November, implying that it should actually fall further before recovering. However, XRP had been in such an oversold and undervalued position prior to November that you could argue that a long and sustained growth period is entirely warranted. And if we do get XRP ETFs in the next few months, the coin could surge back towards $3, before ending 2025 at around $4. New Altcoins Can Outpace Major Tokens While XRP’s fundamentals are as strong as ever, its price may not do much until the ETFs arrive, and it may also be dependent on improvements in international trade relations. If so, traders would do well to diversify into newer tokens, particularly coins awaiting listings on exchanges. This includes presale tokens, which, if strong enough, can rally big when they list for the first time. One example with a strong chance of doing this is MIND of Pepe (MIND) , an ERC-20 token that has now raised $8.1 million in its ongoing sale.

Its algorithms will process social media and trading data to gain insights into the market, which it will also use to generate its own potentially viral tokens. At a time when AI coins are becoming an important element in the market, MIND of Pepe is positioned strongly to grow in the coming year. Holders of its native MIND token will gain access to its market analysis, while they will also gain early access to generated tokens, before they list on exchanges. This helps to explain why demand is strong for MIND, which holders can also stake for a passive income. To join the coin’s sale, investors need only go to the MIND of Pepe website , where MIND costs $0.0037315.

Cointelegraph has dissected historical bot revenues and token price rollercoasters and backtested strategy returns against the buy-and-hold yardstick to decode what bots shine brightest — and when — so you can pick the perfect bot to match your style and stomach for risk. We have examined three types of trading bots: Telegram bots trading on decentralized exchanges (DEX), non-Telegram bots trading on DEXs and on centralized exchanges (CEXs), and the recently evolving AI agent bots. Choosing the right trading bot depends on the user’s goals, risk tolerance and experience. At a glance: Telegram bots are ideal for fast, opportunistic trading like token launches and memecoins. AI agent bots, such as ai16z or Virtuals, suit users who want hands-off automation and are comfortable with experimental strategies. CEX bots offer the most control and are best for structured strategies like dollar-cost averaging (DCA), grid or signal-based trading. Bot trading strategies and performance Trading bots are sophisticated automated systems that use algorithms to analyze cryptocurrency market data and autonomously execute trades on centralized exchanges or decentralized platforms. These bots typically operate continuously, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, requiring minimal human oversight. Their core function involves the analysis of extensive amounts of real-time and historical market data, including price fluctuations, trading volumes and order book information. There are numerous potential advantages to employing AI agent trading bots. Their continuous operation ensures that no trading opportunities are missed, as they can monitor markets around the clock, accommodating global market movements. Some platforms offering these bots also provide backtesting capabilities, enabling users to evaluate the potential effectiveness of different trading strategies using historical data before deploying them with real capital. Telegram DEX bots Telegram bots operate via Telegram, leveraging its accessibility and real-time communication to execute trades directly on DEXs. They often focus on speed and sniping new tokens, appealing to users in fast-moving ecosystems like Solana. The recently launched protocols also included additional features that are often available in CEX trading bots, such as grid trading, DCA and limit orders. Telegram bots such as Maestro and Unibot first appeared around 2020–2021. In 2022, many of these bots were already offering advanced features like copy trading and arbitrage. By the end of 2023, Solana-based bots like BONKBot and Trojan Bot gained prominence for their speed in trading memecoins on DEXs. The biggest advantage of Telegram bots is their ability to trade on mobile devices without the need for a web browser extension to connect to a wallet. It hugely improves the usability of mobile trading, monitoring and integration with social networks. The top five Telegram bots by historical trading volume across all blockchains are Trojan, BonkBot, Maestro, Banana Gun and Sol Trading Bot. The majority of the trading volumes in the past 90 days happened on Solana, where all of the top five Telegram bots operate. DEX trading bot wars. Source: Dune Analytics The functionalities offered by the Telegram bots are very similar, with the exception that some of them (i.e., Maestro and Banana Gun) focus on multichain operations, whereas the rest focus on Solana. The main use case for Telegram bots is to automatically identify profitable entry and exit points and execute trades quickly; it’s very difficult to track the profits or losses made by individual users from each trade. Since some of the Telegram bots, such as Banana Gun and BonkBot, offer a revenue-sharing model tied to their own tokens in the form of purchasing back their tokens with the 1% fee they charge, the token price and revenue (fees received) are used as an approximation of the performance of Telegram bots.

Looking at the price evolution in the past six months, the performance of the remaining parts is very similar, except for the significant rise in BONK’s price in November 2024. They both experienced significant price drops during the recent bearish market conditions.

The term “agent” suggests these bots possess a degree of independence and decision-making capability that extends beyond the fixed rules of traditional automated trading systems. The most well-known AI agent frameworks that exist today are Virtuals and ai16z. Virtuals Protocol, launched in October 2024 on the Ethereum layer-2 network Base, is an AI agent generator platform designed to simplify the creation and deployment of AI agents on the blockchain. While Virtuals is not solely focused on trading, the platform enables the development of AI agents that could potentially be designed for trading purposes. For instance, Aixbt, an experimental AI agent on the platform, tracks discussions on X to identify potential market insights, suggesting a strategy that could inform trading decisions. Since Virtuals Protocol focuses on a launchpad model where agents are tokenized individually (e.g., LUNA and AIXBT) and operate across different areas such as gaming, trading and entertainment, we’ll only look into the performance of AIXBT, the token of the trading agent with the largest market capitalization on Virtuals.

Launched in October 2024, ai16z utilizes sophisticated AI agents, powered by the Eliza framework, to autonomously analyze market data, including price movements, social media sentiment and onchain analytics, and execute trades. The fund functions as an AI investment decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), allowing holders of its native token to participate in governance by voting on key decisions and influencing trading strategies through a “virtual marketplace of trust.” AI Marc, a virtual fund manager built using the Eliza framework, oversees the fund’s trading activities. AI16Z tokens represent ownership in the fund and grant governance rights, with the agent’s actions driving token value. AI16Z price history. Source: CoinMarketCap Comparing the trading volumes from these two agents, they both reached a peak in January 2025, with AI16Z reaching $501 million and AIXBT reaching $682 million. AI16Z’s price hit its peak slightly earlier than its volume high, whereas for AIXBT, the price and volume peaks coincided around the same time. AI16Z and AIXBT price and volume comparison. Source: CoinMarketCap AIXBT’s price performance is more impressive than AI16Z. At the peak, the token price was almost 4,000x the initial price in November 2024, whereas for AI16Z, this was around 111x. Even after the recent downturn and the broader market trending down, the latest price record at the end of March 2025 is still 478x the initial price for AIXBT and 6.8x for AI16Z. DEX/CEX bots These platforms are web-based and operate outside Telegram. You can trade directly on DEXs through wallet connection or connect to a CEX via APIs or a simple login option as part of their integrated exchange solutions. These web-based platforms offer a wide range of strategies and broader market access; they cater to users preferring both CEX liquidity and reliability as well as DEX’s decentralized, non-custodial nature. Some of these platforms also offer a quick switch between DEX and CEX with one click, making the discovery of price discrepancies between CEX and DEX (or CEX-DEX arbitrage) much easier. The most common strategies available on these platforms are grid, DCA and signal bot. A DCA bot invests a fixed amount of money into a cryptocurrency at regular intervals — regardless of the asset’s price. The idea is to spread out your entry points over time, which helps reduce the impact of market volatility. This type of strategy tends to perform well during price-trending periods. A grid bot is built for active trading — buying low and selling high in a structured way to profit from price fluctuations. A grid bot places a series of buy and sell limit orders at preset intervals above and below a set price range. This creates a “grid” of orders, and the bot profits from each completed buy-low/sell-high cycle. Grid bot works best in sideways markets with high volatility. A signal bot executes trades based on external signals — these usually come from technical indicators, market analysis or third-party services. These signals can be relative strength index (RSI), exponential moving averages (EMA), Bollinger Bands, etc. The following table shows the historical performance for the token pairs BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT and SOL/USDT for the three trading strategies. The parameter selection for the grid bot utilizes the 3Commas AI optimization built-in functionality to select the best parameters, whereas for DCA, the most popular classic trading strategy from their users is selected. For the signal bot, Dash2Trade provides strategy presets where the top strategy for each token is selected. These strategies are backtested on a proprietary system used to trade on live markets but are only available for the 120 days before Jan. 26, 2025. Due to a lack of consistent availability of data on the platforms, three backtesting periods were used for each of the three strategies. The table below shows the simple price change during the corresponding period, which is also the return for the simple benchmark buy-and-hold strategy. The available data suggests that performance can vary widely based on the specific bot, the trading strategy employed and the prevailing market conditions at the time the backtests were run. BTC and ETH price. Source: CoinMarketCap During the 120-day period from Sept. 26, 2024, to Jan. 26, 2025, when the signal bots were backtested, the market prices for Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ether ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ) were all upward trending with a buy-and-hold return of 58%, 23% and 55%, respectively. The signal bots’ strategies were performing in line with the buy-and-hold strategy (in some cases slightly worse) for BTC (58.15%), ETH (16.79%) and SOL (48.68%). Comparing the same 120-day period but from Dec. 4, 2024, to April 4, 2025, when grid bots were backtested, the market prices for BTC, ETH and SOL were all experiencing a downward trend, with a buy-and-hold return of -16%, -53% and -49%, respectively, which is completely different from the previous 120-day backtesting period. The grid bots’ strategies were performing much better than the buy-and-hold strategy during the downward-trending, high-volatility market conditions, giving positive returns for BTC (9.6%), ETH (10.4%) and SOL (21.88%). BTC and SOL price. Source: CoinMarketCap For the longest 180-day backtesting period from Oct. 4, 2024, to April 4, 2025, when the DCA bots were backtested, the buy-and-hold returns for BTC, ETH and SOL were 34%, -25% and -18%, respectively. The signal bots’ strategies were performing very differently for the three tokens compared to the buy-and-hold strategy. For BTC, a 17.75% return is generated from the DCA bots, which is worse than the buy-and-hold strategy. However, for ETH (58.12%) and SOL (80.92%), the DCA returns are much better than the buy-and-hold returns. This might be due to the fact that ETH and SOL experienced much higher volatility during the period compared to BTC, and the DCA strategy was able to spread out entry prices to reduce exposure to bad timing. Related: Market maker deals are quietly killing crypto projects Trading bot performance comparison Telegram DEX bots like Trojan and Sol Trading Bot dominated in revenue over the past six months, with Trojan earning about $109 million in fees. Sol Trading Bot stood out for consistent daily earnings relative to its size. However, all bots saw revenue peak during the January 2025 memecoin hype and have since slowed due to bearish market sentiment. Token-linked bots (BANANA, BONK) followed a similar pattern — brief surges (notably BONK in November 2024) followed by steep drops tied to broader market trends. AI agent bots showed explosive growth during the same period. AIXBT reached a peak price 4,000x its initial value, far outperforming AI16Z (111x). Even post-correction, AIXBT held strong at 478x vs. AI16Z’s 6.8x. Volume-wise, both peaked in January 2025, but AIXBT’s token price closely tracked its volume rise, suggesting strong speculative momentum. CEX/DEX signals, grid and DCA bots showed the importance of market conditions, and the performance results vary quite a lot compared to the buy-and-hold strategy. Signal bots performed close to the buy-and-hold strategy during the uptrend market condition (backtesting period September 2024–January 2025), with marginally lower or similar returns. Grid bots excelled during a downtrend and high volatility environment (backtesting period December 2024–April 2025), beating the buy-and-hold strategy by wide margins, flipping negative market returns into double-digit gains. DCA bots over a 180-day backtesting period (October 2024–April 2025) had mixed results; they underperformed the buy-and-hold strategy for BTC but dramatically outperformed ETH and SOL, most likely due to their ability to absorb and capitalize on volatility. Key takeaways We have dived into the wild world of AI-powered crypto trading bots, pitting Telegram DEX bots, AI agent bots and CEX/DEX bots against each other — each a unique tool tailored to different traders and market conditions. Telegram DEX bots are designed for ease of use, with a simple interface embedded in the Telegram app. These bots focus on trading memecoins or participating in token launches onchain. They appeal to mobile-savvy traders and memecoin enthusiasts who prioritize quick trades and social integration, with features such as copy trade and revenue-sharing through tokens. Telegram DEX bots generated significant revenue in the past six months, peaking in January 2025’s memecoin season. But not all of them share revenue with the users. The only two who did (BANANA, BONK) faltered in the recent bearish market, with token prices dropping sharply. AI agent bots use natural language interfaces and AI decision-making to lower the barrier to entry for users interested in governance (e.g., AI16Z’s DAO model) or sentiment-driven strategies (e.g., AIXBT’s X analysis). Their primary strength lies in abstracting complex trading strategies through conversational interfaces. Although AI agent bots’ token price exhibited explosive growth, the recent market downtrend has led to less trading activity and lower token prices. AI agent bots stand out as a more experimental category. They remain under development and are best suited for users who are tech-curious or seeking a hybrid between simplicity and automation. Bots operating on DEXs or CEXs directly offer web-based platforms with diverse strategies, suiting more experienced traders who need high-speed execution, multi-exchange access, deep liquidity and complex configurability. The backtesting results show signal bots give similar returns to the bullish buy-and-hold strategy, whereas grid bots thrive in volatile downturn markets, and DCA bots outperform the buy-and-hold strategy for more volatile assets.

By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $1.39. In 2031, FLOW will range between $3.37 to $4.46. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025?

The coin is approaching the $0.388 resistance level. FLOW holds above the 20-period moving average at $0.372. Flow coin 1-day price analysis: FLOW breaks above 20-day SMA The FLOW/USDT 1-day chart on April 22 shows a bullish trend, with the price rising above the middle Bollinger band at $0.353 and currently trading at $0.376. FLOW/USD 1-day price chart The Bollinger Bands are widening, signaling increased volatility, and the price is nearing the upper band at $0.388. The MACD just turned positive with a bullish crossover, suggesting upward momentum. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis: Bullish momentum builds in the short-term FLOW is showing some short-term strength on the 4-hour chart. It’s holding above the 20-period moving average at $0.372, which is a good sign that buyers are still in the market. FLOW/USD 4-hour price chart The Chaikin Money Flow is positive at 0.16, indicating a positive cash inflow. Meanwhile, the Money Flow Index is sitting at 66, getting close to overbought but not quite there yet. Overall, things look bullish for now, but we’re near a zone where the price could slow down or pull back a bit. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3669 BUY SMA 5 $0.3770 SELL SMA 10 $0.3658 BUY SMA 21 $0.3634 BUY SMA 50 $0.3958 SELL SMA 100 $0.4932 SELL SMA 200 $0.5966 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3475 BUY EMA 5 $0.3496 BUY EMA 10 $0.3607 BUY EMA 21 $0.3811 SELL EMA 50 $0.4317 SELL EMA 100 $0.5068 SELL EMA 200 $0.5831 SELL What to expect from Flow ? FLOW’s looking strong right now, with buyers in control. If it breaks above $0.388, it could push higher. If not, a quick dip to around $0.37 or $0.35 might happen first. Overall, momentum’s on the bullish side. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming weeks. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance.

U.S. crypto firms are increasingly exploring entry into traditional finance. On April 22, crypto.news reached out to Coinbase, which confirmed it is actively considering the possibility of obtaining a U.S. banking license. “This is something Coinbase is actively considering but has not made any formal decisions yet,” a Coinbase spokesperson told crypto.news in an e-mail. The move echoes previous statements by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who noted that based on the volume of consumer funds it manages, Coinbase would rank as the 21st largest bank in the United States. What is more, the exchange is not the only crypto firm that is considering such a move. On April 21, WSJ reported that USDC issuer Circle and crypto custody firm BitGo are also exploring full banking licenses. This would allow them to operate more like traditional banks, offering services like lending, accepting deposits, and more.

However, gaining such licenses involves strict regulatory scrutiny and high compliance costs. So far, the only crypto-native company to hold a banking license is Anchorage Digital. CEO Nathan McCauley revealed the firm spent tens of millions to meet regulatory requirements.

Meanwhile, lawmakers are currently reviewing two major bills: the GENESIS Act and the STABLE Act. These aim to establish regulatory clarity for the crypto sector and are expected to benefit compliant firms. For this reason, U.S. banks are also warming to the crypto business. In February this year, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan revealed that the firm was considering launching its own stablecoin. Earlier, in January, Moynihan also advocated for integrating crypto payments into the banking industry.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap has defied the downtrend in equities, surging to a six-week high of over $89,000 and emerging as an unlikely financial beacon amid the intensifying tariff war between the United States and its main trading partners. How Tariffs Are Fueling Bitcoin’s Rise President Donald Trump’s escalating protectionist stance, including his administration’s recent release of a “non-tariff cheating” list and threats toward Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, has rattled investors and amplified fears of an inflationary spiral. Well-known BTC advocate and crypto investor Kyle Chassé took to X to explain the “tailwinds” behind Bitcoin’s latest uptick. His argument hinges on a chain reaction: tariffs increase import costs, which then drive up consumer prices, eroding purchasing power and weakening confidence in fiat currencies. In this environment, Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature make it an attractive alternative. “Tariffs are inflation in disguise,” Chassé wrote. “As tariffs escalate, global trust in USD weakens. Capital starts seeking neutral ground. Bitcoin, as a borderless and non-sovereign asset, becomes the logical alternative.” There’s a broader geopolitical undercurrent at play, too. China has warned of retaliation against countries cooperating with U.S. tariff demands, and Japan has expressed resistance to continued concessions in trade talks. Bitcoin’s appeal as a “borderless, non-sovereign asset” is growing in this climate. “When markets wobble from geopolitical tension, BTC bounces back faster than stocks or gold,” Chassé said. He also argued that “smart money flows into chaos,” and, in his opinion, BTC is one of the bigger beneficiaries right now. Bitcoin vs. Traditional Markets Recent price action appears to support the analyst’s claim. Bitcoin jumped to a six-week high of $89,200 on Tuesday, reflecting an 18% rally from its local bottom of $75,000 earlier in the month. Over the past 24 hours, the asset gained a modest 2%. That upward move has propelled the cryptocurrency’s market cap above $1.75 trillion, with its dominance now sitting at 61.4% (on CoinGecko), a mark of its growing strength relative to the wider crypto market. Interestingly, this resurgence has coincided with gold hitting an all-time high near $3,500 per ounce, indicating a broader flight to perceived safe-haven assets. The strong showings of gold and its digital counterpart have come against the backdrop of steep dips in U.S. equities. Since April 9, the S&P 500 has erased $2.5 trillion in value, and the Nasdaq Composite is down 16% year-to-date, according to Bernstein’s Gautam Chhugani. In that time, BTC shed only 10%, with Chhugani indicating in a research note that the asset is fast becoming a “Main Street proxy” as it outperforms traditional tech-heavy indices.

To read full editions, subscribe . Let’s talk about tokens. It’s been a fairly big debate on CT (sorry, Elon, CX just doesn’t have the same ring to it). But let me back up for those of you who have managed to spare yourselves from the takes across social media: Basically, in light of ZORA, folks are debating the overall appetite for tokens. “$ZORA is for fun only and does not entitle its holders to any governance rights or a claim on any equity ownership in Zora or its products,” Zora said on its website . We’ve talked a few times now about the rise of fundamentals in crypto, and tokens like ZORA kind of go directly against that thesis because there are no fundamentals. And that’s the debate that I’ve been stuck on. Ryan Connor of Blockworks Research thinks that crypto should focus on tokens that are backed by fundamentals. Connor has long been a believer in the rise of fundamentals . On the other hand, folks say that tokens like ZORA are bullish because they introduce a new type to experiment with. seeing lots of hate for the zora token because it doesn't grant any rights to holders imo this is good actually – we need more experimentation on what tokens mean, in all directions. not a memecoin, not a gov token, but an exciting new thing. bullish — yitong (@zhayitong) April 21, 2025 However, is ZORA really any different than a memecoin? While Zora promotes itself as being for “fun only,” it’s not as fun as a memecoin per se, given that those who buy the token are funding the treasury without getting anything in return. In fact, one of the best critiques of ZORA I’ve seen came from Triton’s Kevin Mills, who noted that the issue isn’t that the token is for fun, but rather the fact that the money goes to serve the project and investors. This is exactly the problem. Zora launching a token – and simultaneously claiming it is just 'for fun' and does not confer any rights or claims on flows, but then allocating 'just for fun money' to its treasury and investors. What does that mean? They are willingly letting… https://t.co/IEBFs6gghz pic.twitter.com/fbcLFswEnz — Kevin Mills (@__kfm__) April 21, 2025 “Tokens are controversial,” Connor noted. “Especially in the context of memecoins, which I think have been objectively the most successful product in the history of crypto.” He added that crypto projects have to ask themselves: where does a token make sense? “You have a lot of data collected in crypto where you should mostly know where tokens make sense. In the context of scarcity and assets that have value, tokens make a lot of sense. In the context of governance, tokens make a lot of sense in the context of the memecoin game,” he added. But the difference between a memecoin for fun and a token like ZORA is that folks understand the game of “chicken” that they’re playing when jumping into a memecoin that could quickly wipe out in a matter of minutes. launching a 300M FDV token just for fun and without any responsibility, then giving 56.7M to investors and team members as a little joke https://t.co/BIeYSNYsx8 — zkboccaccio (@salveboccaccio) April 21, 2025 “However, in the context of project tokens, it was a very early 2024 thing where a project could launch a memecoin, and people would jump in,” Connor said. “The market is increasingly punishing projects that have done that, and in light of the market exhaustion over a low float, high FDV … my bet is ZORA, if it is just a memecoin, I don’t expect it to do too well.” Get the news in your inbox.

33767162,[object Object],1745328610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Ripple Faces Major Challenger As Circle Enters Payments Arena,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-major-challenger-circle/,"Circle’s decision to unveil the Circle Payments Network (CPN) on 21 April has set the stage for the first head‑to‑head contest between a fully reserved stable‑asset rail and Ripple’s decade‑old Ripple Payments ( formerly On-Demand Liquidity – ODL ) product. Circle Enters Payments Arena Announced in a post on X, Circle describes CPN as “a streamlined way for financial institutions to connect, orchestrating global money movement, powered by stablecoins like USDC and EURC for 24/7 real‑time settlement.” The company promises programmability, constant availability and “internet‑speed” settlement for four initial verticals—invoice settlement, remittances, treasury flows and payroll—while signalling that over twenty institutions have already joined as design partners. Although Circle has long issued the second‑largest dollar stablecoin, until now it had refrained from owning the payment rail itself. CPN changes that calculus. According to the newly released white paper , CPN is “a new protocol layer in a comprehensive, open and internet‑based settlement system—with USDC, EURC, and eventually other regulated payment stablecoins at its core.” The governance stack places Circle in the role of operator, standard‑setter and compliance gatekeeper, requiring every participating entity—termed a “Participating Financial Institution,” or PFI—to satisfy stringent licencing and AML/CFT criteria before accessing the network. At a technical level the network begins life as an off‑chain orchestration layer that broadcasts signed transfers to public blockchains, but it is already mapped to migrate into a smart‑contract protocol with optional “undo” windows and on‑chain FX routing. In its final form, stablecoin swaps, liquidity discovery and settlement guarantees are envisaged to occur entirely on‑chain, while confidentiality features allow counterparties to mark transactions as private and expose them selectively to regulators or auditors. For banks, payment processors and virtual‑asset service providers the commercial draw is explicit. CPN levies three charges—payout fees, FX spreads and a variable network fee—and pledges to reinvest a part of the revenue into infrastructure upgrades and developer grants, thereby seeding a marketplace of value‑added modules from custody to fraud analytics. Circle argues that this model “aligns incentives across network members, end users, builders, and service providers to encourage network growth and sustainability.” Circle Vs Ripple The competitive overlap with Ripple is immediate and visible. Of the first‑wave partners—Alfred, BVNK, CoinMENA, Coinsph, dLocal , FOMO Pay, Onafriq , WorldRemit, Yellowcard and others—several are also Ripple Payment corridors. That duplication was not lost on Panos Mekras, co-founder of Anodos Finance, who told followers: “Ok, this is big. Circle just launched a direct Ripple competitor… Game is on.” Community member Xoom echoed the sentiment: “Competition results in more growth & innovation.” Ian Lee, co‑founder of Syndicate DAO, offered the sharper strategic take: “This is going after what Ripple and XRP were supposed to, but with stablecoins. Has a much better chance at being adopted since it is more compatible with existing financial institutions’ business models.” Community member xoom (@Mr_Xoom) commented: “This is huge. Circle just announced CPN, a competitor to Ripple payments (aka ODL). Will be fun to see the competition. Competition results in more growth & innovation.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.09.",XRP|Circle CPN|Circle Payments Network|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-22 13:30:10

The decision , issued on April 21 by District Judge Barbara Rothstein, hinges on a principle known as the “first-to-file” rule—a legal doctrine that discourages multiple courts from handling cases with overlapping claims. Similar Claims, Different Courts The Washington lawsuit, filed in August 2024, alleged that Binance enabled cybercriminals to launder stolen cryptocurrency through its platform. But Judge Rothstein noted that the case mirrors one filed earlier in June 2023 in Florida. Both lawsuits involve plaintiffs whose crypto assets were allegedly stolen and funneled through Binance accounts, forming the basis of a proposed class action. “Although the two complaints describe the proposed classes in slightly different terms, both encompass the same proposed class of individuals,” Rothstein wrote in her ruling. “To allow two parallel class actions to proceed in separate districts would be duplicative and inefficient.” This ruling underscores a growing trend in the U.S. legal system to consolidate high-profile crypto cases to streamline judicial processes and avoid conflicting outcomes. Plaintiffs Push Back—But the Court Isn’t Convinced Lawyers representing the plaintiffs in Washington had argued that their case presented unique elements. Their complaint named Binance’s former CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, as a defendant and introduced new allegations absent from the Florida filing. They also contended that transferring the case might delay both lawsuits, potentially harming victims of the alleged thefts. Judge Rothstein, however, remained unconvinced. She emphasized that avoiding duplicated litigation outweighed concerns about procedural delay. “It is not apparent that transferring the suit would delay resolution in either case,” she stated. “On the contrary, consolidation could promote judicial efficiency.” This consolidation is particularly relevant because the Florida court had already issued a ruling in July 2024, directing that the original case be moved to arbitration. The legal dispute highlights the increasingly complex intersection of digital assets and U.S. law. With Binance facing mounting legal pressure both domestically and abroad, this jurisdictional shift could have implications for how future crypto-related lawsuits are handled.

While we navigate the exciting world of digital assets, a traditional safe-haven asset is making headlines of its own. The gold spot price has just smashed through expectations, surging to an unprecedented high and leaving analysts and investors in awe. Forget incremental gains; we’re talking about a monumental leap that has rewritten the record books. Why is the Gold Spot Price Reaching Unheard-of Heights? The yellow metal, often seen as a store of value in times of uncertainty, is experiencing a massive resurgence. But what’s fueling this dramatic climb in the gold spot price ? Let’s break down the key factors: Global Economic Uncertainty: Turbulence in the global economy, geopolitical tensions, and concerns about inflation are driving investors towards safe-haven assets like gold. When traditional markets face volatility, gold often becomes a preferred refuge. Weakening Dollar: A weaker US dollar tends to make gold, priced in dollars, more attractive to investors holding other currencies. This inverse relationship often plays a significant role in gold price movements. Increased Investor Demand: Both institutional and retail investors are flocking to gold, seeking to diversify their portfolios and hedge against potential market downturns. This increased demand naturally pushes the gold price upwards. Central Bank Buying: Several central banks around the world have been accumulating gold reserves, further contributing to the demand and price appreciation. Gold Investment: Is Now the Time to Dive In? With the gold spot price at record levels, the question on everyone’s mind is: Is it too late to invest in gold, or is there still potential for growth? Let’s consider the potential benefits and challenges of gold investment in the current climate: Benefits of Gold Investment Now: Inflation Hedge: Gold is historically considered a strong hedge against inflation. As inflation concerns persist globally, gold can act as a store of value, preserving purchasing power. Portfolio Diversification: Adding gold to an investment portfolio can reduce overall risk by diversifying away from traditional assets like stocks and bonds, especially during periods of market instability. Safe Haven Asset: In times of geopolitical uncertainty or economic crises, gold tends to retain or increase its value, offering a safe haven for capital. Potential for Further Appreciation: If the factors driving the current surge – economic uncertainty, inflation, dollar weakness – persist or intensify, the gold price could potentially climb even higher. Challenges and Risks of Gold Investment: Volatility: While considered a safe haven, gold prices can still be volatile in the short term. Price fluctuations can occur due to various market sentiments and events. No Yield: Unlike stocks or bonds, gold does not generate income or dividends. Returns are solely based on price appreciation. Storage and Security: Physical gold requires secure storage, which can incur costs. Digital gold investments mitigate this but carry different types of risks. Market Timing: As with any investment, buying at the peak of a price surge carries the risk of potential corrections. Careful consideration and analysis are crucial. Record Gold Price: What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? Interestingly, the surge in the record gold price occurs in a landscape where cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are also vying for the title of ‘digital gold’. While seemingly different, both asset classes share some common ground as alternative investments outside of traditional financial systems. Here’s what this gold surge could imply for the crypto market: Increased Awareness of Alternative Assets: The gold surge highlights the broader trend of investors seeking alternative assets to hedge against traditional market risks. This could indirectly benefit cryptocurrencies by further legitimizing and popularizing the concept of alternative investments. Potential Capital Flow Dynamics: Some investors might diversify between gold and cryptocurrencies, viewing them as complementary hedges. A strong performance in gold could draw attention to the broader alternative asset space, potentially benefiting crypto as well. Comparison and Competition: The narrative of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ will likely be further amplified in light of gold’s performance. This could lead to both competition and comparison between the two asset classes, influencing investor sentiment and capital allocation. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Gold Price Surge So, what are the actionable steps investors can take in light of this record gold price surge? Conduct Thorough Research: Before investing in gold, understand the market dynamics, different forms of gold investment (physical gold, gold ETFs, gold mining stocks), and associated risks. Diversify Your Portfolio: Consider gold as part of a diversified investment strategy, rather than putting all your eggs in one basket. Balance gold holdings with other asset classes based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of global economic developments, inflation trends, and geopolitical events that can influence gold prices. Reliable sources like goldprice.org can provide up-to-date information. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging: Given the volatility, consider dollar-cost averaging your gold investments over time to mitigate the risk of buying at a potential peak. Consult a Financial Advisor: Seek professional advice from a qualified financial advisor to determine if gold investment aligns with your individual financial situation and investment objectives. Conclusion: The Golden Era Continues? The gold spot price reaching an all-time high above $3,500 is a significant event, signaling strong investor demand for safe-haven assets amidst global uncertainties. Whether this surge marks the beginning of a prolonged ‘golden era’ remains to be seen, but it undeniably underscores gold’s enduring appeal as a store of value and portfolio diversifier. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and traditional investors alike, understanding the dynamics of the gold market provides valuable insights into broader financial trends and the evolving landscape of alternative investments.

A anonymous cryptocurrency analyst referred to as “Papa” sees XRP reaching a price of up to $14 despite the latest challenges besetting the digital money. The bold prediction comes amid XRP fighting to hold steady at the level of around $2 after experiencing four straight days of losses.

This 4% decline was the first instance since late March when XRP had recorded four consecutive days of falling prices. As per current technical markers, sentiment remains neutral while the Fear & Greed Index hovers at 39, solidly in “Fear” territory. $XRP SCREAMING HIGHER 🚀 pic.twitter.com/DnRGTDs5x6 — PAPA♛ (@MamaGucci) April 19, 2025 In spite of these warning signs, Papa is convinced XRP is “screaming higher” according to chart patterns that reflect the cryptocurrency’s historic bull run of 2017-2018. History May Repeat With New Chart Patterns Reflecting on XRP’s most explosive growth phase, the analyst identifies a symmetrical triangle pattern that developed on a 44-day chart in the 2017-2018 bull market. Following an initial 7,800% rise from $0.0055 in March 2017 to $0.3988 in May of that year, XRP consolidated before breaking out to hit its then-all-time high of $3.31 in January 2018—a breathtaking 1,760% rise from its low of $0.177. Based on these figures, Papa observes similar trends emerging in the current market. In the present cycle, XRP rose 570% from November 2024 at $0.50 to an all-time high of $3.39 in January 2025. Since then, it has fallen 38% and spent three months consolidating. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Sees $120 Million Weekly Surge—Whales Tighten Their Grip Technical Indicators Hint At Double-Digit Prices The analyst’s price targets are derived from Fibonacci extension levels—technical indicators that traders use to forecast price action. During its 2017-2018 run, XRP hit multiple Fibonacci targets at the 1.272, 1.618, 2.618, and 4.618 levels. This type of projection isn’t wishful thinking—it’s driven by historical trends and a technical configuration that has taken shape in market cycles. Fibonacci extensions are considered a guide map by many experienced traders, particularly when an asset moves out of years-long zones of consolidation. In the case of XRP, the intersection of structural resistance, sentiment, and historical Fibonacci behavior provides a strong ground for a breakout, that if conditions are right. From current levels, the analyst sees a potential 575% climb for the altcoin, with the $14 target aligning with the 4.618 Fibonacci extension. He believes hitting that mark depends on XRP breaking above the upper trendline of its current parallel channel at $3, which would set the stage for a similar extension in this cycle. Whether Papa’s pattern-based forecast is accurate or not will hinge on XRP’s capacity to overcome the all-important $3 resistance ceiling within the next few weeks.

Specifically, Trump’s Liberation Day tariff announcement on April 2 triggered a massive BTC sell-off, which took the coin from $84,598 at the time, to a low of $75,004 on April 9. Though Bitcoin enjoyed a partial recovery after the reciprocal tariffs were subsequently paused for 90 days, its fate still appeared closely linked to the stock market . The link was, however, broken on Easter weekend, as Bitcoin took an entirely different direction from the stock market, rallying to its press time of $88,927. BTC 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold The move simultaneously erased the losses from Liberation Day , effectively resetting BTC price and giving it renewed momentum about reclaiming highs above $90,000 and possibly breaching the psychologically critical $100,000 level again. Bitcoin remains a loser in the trade war despite latest rally Although the latest developments have been positive, it is worth noting that BTC has only recovered from the plunge on Liberation Day and remains more than $13,000 below the $102,345 it held on the eve of the trade war. President Trump initiated the international tariff battle with his announcement of duties to be levied on Canada, Mexico, and China on February 1. The event, though overshadowed by the more recent and more extreme proclamations and escalations, coincided with the beginning of the wipe that is still gripping the stock and cryptocurrency markets.

Traders and investors are keeping a close eye on these events for any potential price swings in the market. Key Projects to Watch: UDS, ALT, VENOM, XMW, and HOOK The key projects in focus include Undeads Games (UDS), AltLayer (ALT), Venom (VENOM), Morphware (XMW), and Hooked Protocol (HOOK). VENOM and ALT lead the cliff unlocks, with VENOM releasing 59.26 million tokens valued at $8.25 million, while ALT is unlocking 240.10 million tokens worth $7.09 million.

The ETFs will include digital assets and securities with a focus on the Made in America trend, covering various sectors including energy. Crypto.com will provide the technical platform and cryptocurrencies for these funds, as well as a “unique cryptocurrency ETF basket.” What is known On March 25, Trump Media (DJT), a media company owned by US President Donald Trump, has partnered with Crypto.com, one of the largest US crypto exchanges, to launch exchange-traded products under the Truth.Fi brand. As stated in a press release, the exchange will be the operator for crypto asset transactions. TMTG CEO and Chairman Devin Nunes said, ”We’re excited to join Crypto.com, along with our partner Yorkville America, to launch America First investment products supporting innovative crypto ventures, great American companies, and cutting-edge technologies. We aim to create inventive funds incorporating firms that concentrate on rapid growth, technological innovation, and strengthening the U.S. economy, unencumbered by woke nonsense and political posturing.'' The cryptocurrency of blockchain project Cronos (CRO), developed by the team of the U.S. exchange Crypto.com, rose more than 40% in a few hours from a peak of $0.116 in the morning of March 25. At the time of writing, the price is at 0.087. Trading volume over the past 24 hours increased by 97%, almost to $40 million. The capitalization of the token exceeded $2.38 billion, which allowed CRO to occupy the 39th position in the ranking of the top-100 largest crypto assets by capitalization. Shares of Trump Media are trading on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker DJT as of April 22 at about $22, down 30% from early 2025 levels. According to TradingView, the company has a market capitalization of about $4.96 billion. The organization is the operator of social media platform Truth Social. In late January, the board of directors of Trump Media approved fintech startup Truth.Fi and a $250 million investment, including the purchase of cryptocurrencies and exchange-traded products based on them. And in early February, the company filed to register trademarks related to bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds - Truth.Fi Bitcoin Plus ETF, Truth.Fi Bitcoin Plus SMA. In late November 2024, Trump Media discussed the purchase of Bakkt, a platform that provides digital asset trading services. No new details have been forthcoming since then, though. It is known that in mid-December 2024, Crypto.com head Chris Marszalek met with the president at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate. They discussed appointments of officials open to the crypto industry, as well as the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve. Following the meeting, Crypto.com withdrew a lawsuit against the U.S. exchange regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), alleging that the SEC had overstepped its authority by labeling some cryptocurrencies as securities. ”We look forward to working with the new administration to develop and implement clear regulations for the crypto industry so that the U.S. can become a global leader in digital assets and innovation,” Chris Marszalek said. The new strategy In early March, a day after Trump announced that his cryptocurrency task force should move more aggressively with the creation of a ”strategic digital asset reserve,” the Cronos team announced the reissuance of 70 billion CROs (about $7.7 billion at March 25 exchange rates). The announcement came as part of the project's new development strategy and the CRO 70 billion will go towards development with the condition that it will be locked in for the next ten years with gradual release once a month: In 2021, 70 billion CROs were burned in one of the most significant burn transactions in history. Under today's offer, an equal number of tokens will be reissued on Cronos. The Cronos blockchain is an unremarkable network in terms of user activity. According to data TokenTerminal on March 25, for the past 365 days, the network was able to earn only $2.7 million in transaction fees. And the number of daily active users is just over 5 thousand. At the peak, in April 2022, the figure exceeded 50 thousand users. For comparison: Solana blockchain has the same indicators for the same period amounted to more than $1 billion in commission revenue and the number of active users 4.2 million with a peak of 6.4 million. Prominent crypto detective ZachXBT wrote in a comment on the Crypto.com head's reported partnership with Trump's media company that the reissue of 70 billion CROs is ”no different than fraud.” ”Not sure why Truth chose to partner with your exchange and not Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, etc. after this move by your team [CRO reissue],” wrote expert.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|CRO,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-22 13:37:29

43669092,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=151415,1745329241,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Warning: Metaplex Faces Legal Threat Over Unclaimed SOL – NFT Holders at Risk?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/metaplex-legal-threat-unclaimed-sol/,"A storm is brewing in the Solana NFT space as Metaplex, a prominent platform, finds itself under legal scrutiny. U.S.-based crypto law firm Burwick Law has raised serious litigation concerns regarding Metaplex’s approach to handling a substantial amount of unclaimed SOL . Are NFT holders about to lose out on funds rightfully theirs? Let’s dive into the details of this developing situation and understand what it means for the Metaplex community and the wider NFT ecosystem. Is Metaplex Facing a Legal Showdown Over Unclaimed SOL? The crux of the issue revolves around unclaimed SOL tokens resulting from Metaplex’s optimization efforts last year. To enhance efficiency and reduce on-chain storage costs, Metaplex introduced a method to resize NFTs using Metaplex Token Metadata (TM). This process allowed NFT holders to reclaim small amounts of SOL that were initially allocated for larger storage. Think of it as getting back the change after a transaction – a seemingly minor amount, but it adds up when we’re talking about blockchain transactions. However, here’s the catch: Metaplex set a deadline of April 25th for users to claim this unclaimed SOL . What happens to the funds if they remain unclaimed after this deadline? This is where the controversy ignites. Instead of automatically returning the unclaimed SOL to the respective NFT holders, Metaplex plans to transfer these funds – estimated to be over 54,000 SOL – to its DAO treasury. This decision has raised eyebrows and sparked legal debate, with Burwick Law stepping into the arena to voice their concerns. Burwick Law Sounds the Alarm: Litigation Risks for Metaplex Burwick Law’s warning is stark and direct. The firm argues that sweeping such a significant amount of unclaimed SOL into the DAO treasury, rather than ensuring its return to NFT holders, could expose Metaplex to potential litigation . Their legal argument centers on the principle of ‘unjust enrichment’ and potential violations of consumer protection laws. Essentially, the law firm is suggesting that if Metaplex profits from these unclaimed funds without a clear and justifiable reason, they could face legal challenges from disgruntled users. To put the numbers into perspective: Total Unclaimed SOL: Over 54,000 SOL SOL Claimed So Far: 7,043 SOL (as per Metaplex’s website) Deadline for Claims: April 25th This data highlights a substantial amount of SOL still hanging in the balance. While 7,043 SOL has been claimed, a significant portion remains unclaimed, creating a potentially large sum for the DAO treasury and a potential legal headache for Metaplex. What Does Metaplex Say? The DAO Treasury Angle Metaplex has defended its position by stating that the unclaimed SOL tokens, if transferred to the DAO treasury, would be used for community-led initiatives. These initiatives could include: Airdrops: Distributing tokens to community members. Grants: Funding projects and developers within the Metaplex ecosystem. Community Endeavors: Supporting various community-driven projects and activities. The allocation of funds would be subject to DAO voting, giving the community a say in how the unclaimed SOL is utilized. Metaplex argues this approach is beneficial for the long-term growth and sustainability of the platform, fostering community engagement and development. NFT Holders in the Crossfire: Are Your Funds at Risk? The central question for NFT holders is: are they at risk of losing their funds? While the amount of SOL reclaimable per NFT might be small individually, collectively, it represents a significant sum. Burwick Law’s intervention suggests that there is a legitimate legal argument to be made that these funds rightfully belong to the NFT holders and not to the DAO treasury without explicit consent or a clearer justification. Here’s what NFT holders need to consider: Check if you are eligible for a claim: Review your Metaplex NFTs and see if you are entitled to reclaim SOL. Act before the deadline: Ensure you claim your SOL before April 25th to avoid any potential complications. Stay informed: Follow updates from Metaplex and Burwick Law, as well as crypto news outlets, to stay abreast of developments. The Broader Implications: Setting a Precedent in the NFT Space? This situation extends beyond just Metaplex. It raises important questions about how crypto platforms should handle unclaimed funds and the rights of users in decentralized ecosystems. The outcome of this situation could set a precedent for future cases involving NFT unclaimed funds and DAO governance. Key takeaways to consider: Transparency and Communication: Clear and proactive communication from platforms regarding fund handling is crucial. User Rights: Balancing the interests of the platform and the rights of individual users is essential in decentralized spaces. Legal Clarity: The evolving legal landscape of crypto assets necessitates clearer guidelines and regulations regarding user fund protection. Actionable Insights: What Should You Do Now? For NFT holders , the immediate action is clear: check and claim your SOL before the deadline. Don’t leave money on the table, even if it seems like a small amount. For the wider crypto community, this situation serves as a reminder of the importance of vigilance and understanding the terms and conditions of platforms you interact with. It also highlights the growing need for legal clarity and user protection within the rapidly evolving crypto space. The legal challenge to Metaplex’s plan underscores the increasing scrutiny and regulation that the crypto industry is facing. As the space matures, legal frameworks are catching up, and user rights are becoming a central focus. This Metaplex scenario is a critical case to watch, as it could have significant repercussions for how platforms manage user funds and the future of DAO governance in the crypto world. In conclusion, the litigation concerns surrounding Metaplex and its unclaimed SOL plan represent a pivotal moment for the platform and the broader NFT ecosystem. Whether it escalates into a full-blown legal battle or is resolved amicably, this situation serves as a potent reminder of the importance of user rights, transparency, and sound governance in the decentralized world of cryptocurrencies.

43669279,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=713659,1745329245,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43669279.jpeg,"Could Harvard, the oldest university in America, beat Trump in their battle?",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/harvard-sues-trump-for-financial-assault/,"Harvard University filed a lawsuit against Donald Trump’s administration on Monday, accusing the federal government of trying to wreck the university’s financial lifeline. Trump has frozen over $2.2 billion in federal research money meant for the school. The university claims this is part of a political attack dressed up as an anti-antisemitism campaign, but in reality, aimed at crushing elite institutions over their race and gender programs. The lawsuit is a direct response to a sudden letter sent by the government that blocked ongoing contracts. That letter, sent without warning, halted critical research. The administration’s argument is that schools like Harvard are pushing agendas that don’t align with “American values,” and they’re using federal cash to do it. Trump has also hinted that Harvard should lose its tax-exempt status. If that happens, the school would be taxed like a business, and donations would take a hit. Trump has openly said he might want to pull “every last penny” from the university. Trump cuts federal funding and threatens taxes At the center of this legal battle is nearly $687 million in annual research money that Harvard receives from federal agencies. Most of it comes from the Department of Health and Human Services. Other big chunks are sent by NASA, HUD, and even intelligence agencies. Right now, researchers are getting “stop-work” notices. Projects already affected include studies on Lou Gehrig’s disease, a $60 million tuberculosis program, and research on radiation sickness and space travel. The university warned that many of these will “come to a halt midstream” if the freeze continues. Last month, Harvard imposed a hiring freeze. Layoffs, lab shutdowns, and cutting projects are all being discussed. In 2023, Harvard used $489 million of its own money to support research. That can’t make up the gap. The lawsuit also raises concerns that the IRS might yank the school’s tax-exempt status. That’s something it has never faced. If it loses the exemption, Harvard will be taxed on its tuition revenue. While the school could deduct salaries and expenses, donations would be taxed. Samuel D. Brunson, a professor at Loyola University Chicago who studies nonprofit tax law, said the loss “would reduce the number of donors, the amount that donors gave, or both.” Republicans are also coming after endowments. Vice President JD Vance , who used university funding to attend Yale, now wants to raise the tax on endowment income from 1.4% to 35%. Trump’s tariffs could also increase costs. And a drop in international students would be another blow. Harvard struggles to protect its billions At the end of its last fiscal year, Harvard held $64 billion. That’s more than the entire state budget of Massachusetts. More than $53 billion of that is in its endowment. The rest comes from tuition, real estate, donations, and unrestricted investments. But the endowment isn’t one giant pool of cash. It’s split across more than 14,000 individual funds, many with restrictions from donors. About 80% of the endowment is restricted. That’s more than what schools like Yale and Princeton deal with. Even though former President Barack Obama and ex-Harvard President Lawrence H. Summers have pushed the school to tap into the fund, it can’t just pull out cash freely. Each year, Harvard pulls out 4.2% to 6.1% of the market value of the endowment. In 2024, that was about $2.4 billion. The school’s operating costs are more than $6 billion a year. So while the school has massive money, most of it is locked behind donor rules. Harvard’s real estate is also worth over $1 billion. Its general operating account has billions in unrestricted cash. Around 20% of its revenue comes from student tuition, room, and board. But research funding from the feds makes up around 11%. And that’s what Trump is cutting. Dr. Lawrence S. Bacow, who served as Harvard’s president during a past crisis, said in meetings that raiding the endowment now would have long-term damage. Still, even some insiders say this is the kind of moment that might justify it. Drew Gilpin Faust, another former president, said the fallout from Trump’s funding cuts could spiral far beyond the school. Harvard hasn’t revealed its full backup plan. But shrinking is clearly on the table. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Metaplanet CEO Reassures Investors Amid Stock Price Drop: “We’re Just Getting Started” Speaking on social media earlier Tuesday, Gerovich addressed shareholder concerns about Metaplanet’s stock performance, which has fallen 15.8% in the past month and is down 7.6% year-to-date. “Some shareholders have expressed concerns about our stock price. We take these concerns seriously and are grateful for your continued support, even in today’s volatile market environment,” he said. Despite the recent pullback, Metaplanet’s shares have surged over 860% since the firm began aggressively accumulating Bitcoin in April 2024. Gerovich emphasized that the mission of the Tokyo-listed firm is to “create long-term institutional value” through its identity as a Bitcoin Treasury company, rather than short-term stock fluctuations. “We are steadily executing on a clear strategy to become one of the most valuable companies in the world,” he said. “We are just getting started.” Last week, Metaplanet purchased another 330 BTC (about $28 million), bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to 4,855 BTC, worth about $430 million. This solidifies Metaplanet’s position as the largest institutional Bitcoin holder in Asia and the tenth largest globally behind Michael Saylor’s Strategy in terms of buying pace. Metaplanet uses proprietary performance indicators such as BTC Yield, growth in BTC assets per share, to measure the impact of its strategy. Year-to-date, the firm has achieved a BTC Return of 119.3%, significantly above its quarterly target of 35%. “This means that those who have held shares since the beginning of the year have roughly doubled their BTC per share,” Gerovich said. Another metric, BTC Earnings, reflects Metaplanet’s financial creativity, for example, using options strategies to acquire more Bitcoin than is possible with standard spot purchases. In one example, the company used a $62.7 million cash-secured put option to buy $67.9 million worth of Bitcoin. In total, such tactics netted the company an additional 2,174 BTC. *This is not investment advice.

In comparison, the S&P 500 was trading above 5,700 points on March 7 and has since slipped below 5,200. Despite the recent bounce, bitcoin remains down more than 5% year to date. It has, however, recovered significantly from its April 8 low, when it was down nearly 20% on the year and more than 30% below its record of around $109,000 in January. That marked the steepest correction of this cycle and eclipsed the August 2024 drawdown, when it slid to $49,000. From a market structure perspective, the average perpetual funding rate across exchanges is currently negative. Perpetual funding rates reflect the cost of holding long or short positions in futures markets. When the rate is negative, it means short sellers are paying long holders to maintain their positions, a setup that can accelerate price moves higher because shorts are forced to cover their positions in what's known as a short squeeze. Adding to the bullish momentum, Monday marked the largest single-day inflow into U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs since Jan. 30, totaling over $380 million. With the Nasdaq up more than 1% on what some observers are terming “Turnaround Tuesday,” bitcoin may gain further upside, though key technical resistance levels still lie ahead.

Dogecoin price may reach a maximum of $1.07 in 2025. With a potential surge, the DOGE price may achieve its $3 mark in 2030. Dogecoin, the memecoin category leader, has picked up the pace amidst the uptrend in the market. Between the turn of events, marketers are still hoping for it to match its June 2021 high. The hopes could soon be fulfilled, as the House of Doge within the Dogecoin Foundation has opened the doors to the “Official Dogecoin Reserve” by acquiring 10 million DOGE to boost payment utility and transaction efficiency. Talking about DOGE’s price, it is currently holding onto its support/resistance at $0.1666, a bullish push from here could lead DOGE to its resistance at $0.17. On the flipside, if bears hunt DOGE down, its price could tumble to $0.15 in the very short term. As the underlying dynamics shift amid broader market volatility, investors have started wondering, “Will Dogecoin reach $1?” to “Will Dogecoin go up?” Are you wondering the same? Worry not, Coinpedia’s Dogecoin price prediction 2025 to 2030 will clear all such doubts. Look at this well-researched and detailed DOGE price prediction for the upcoming moves.

On the other hand, if the market is hit again by external forces like regulations or negative statements by influencers. Hence, the meme coin might trade at a potential low of $ 0.62 . We expect the DOGE price to reach a new swing high of $1.07 by the end of 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $0.62 $0.84 $1.07 Can DOGE Break the $1 Barrier? Given DOGE’s success, largely driven by hype with some technical progress, crossing $1 by 2025 remains a realistic possibility. A sustained media frenzy and growing endorsement deals could maintain bullish momentum. Expanded merchant adoption would also strengthen confidence in its long-term viability. Dogecoin’s Tokenomics and Long-Term Outlook The future of Dogecoin hinges on its utility. Meme popularity alone may not sustain it indefinitely, but advancements in transaction fees, speed, and business collaborations could help it thrive as a mainstream digital currency. Its large and passionate community will likely continue to drive positive evolution. Conclusion Given Dogecoin’s past price behavior, driven largely by online hype and media coverage, it has the potential to reach over $1 in 2025. DOGE has shown remarkable resilience, and key factors like expanded merchant adoption, community growth, and protocol upgrades could enhance its viability.

However, the question of the underlying reasons for the crash remains unanswered, blockchain investigators told Cointelegraph. Unpacking Mantra’s OM crash would require a detailed forensic study rather than just basic blockchain analysis, said Natalie Newson, senior blockchain investigator at the blockchain security firm CertiK. “A full forensic investigation, akin to what we saw post-FTX, would be needed to substantiate claims of calculated exploitation,” Newson told Cointelegraph, highlighting challenges of tracing over-the-counter (OTC) transactions. Newson’s perspective on the OM crash came days after Mantra released its post-crash statement, asking centralized exchange partners to collaborate on further unpacking the incident. Onchain activity versus opaque OTC deals Addressing the OM token crash, Newson stressed the importance of distinguishing between public onchain activity and the “more opaque nature of OTC deals.” Mantra CEO Mullin disclosed in an interview with Coffeezilla on April 15 that the Mantra team had “done a small amount of OTCs,” up to $30 million of OM tokens. Mantra’s founder and CEO, John Mullin, in an interview with Coffeezilla. Source: YouTube Unlike traceable transactions on centralized exchanges, OTC crypto transfers involve a method of buying and selling cryptocurrencies outside of exchanges, designed to enable deep liquidity and big trades while mitigating the volatility of prices. “In this case, the accumulation of approximately 100 million OM by a whale appears to have been the result of secondary market transactions — not necessarily direct activity from Mantra insiders,” Newson said. Analysis by Arkham or Nansen is not enough As previously mentioned, Mullin denied allegations that the OM crash resulted from an insider token dump, claiming that blockchain analytics platform Arkham had “mislabelled” some wallets. Newson said that data from Arkham and similar platforms like Nansen would be insufficient to confirm or deny insider involvement. “To confirm coordinated insider behavior, it would likely require more than just basic wallet tracing on platforms like Arkham or Nansen,” Newson said, adding: “Blockchain analytics tools can provide directional clues, but without access to offchain agreements and centralized exchange records, drawing definitive conclusions would be difficult.” Newson is not alone in highlighting the complicated nature of tracing transactions in the OM token crash. Related: Mantra OM token crash exposes ‘critical’ liquidity issues in crypto “There are ways to get data from the node, but it does not seem to be easy to get a full history,” Whale Alert’s co-founder Frank Weert told Cointelegraph. Mullin previously said that the team had been considering hiring a forensic auditor following the OM crash but had made no decision as of April 16.

According to its annual report, Bitdeer entered a loan agreement in April with affiliate firm Matrixport, a crypto financial services company founded by Bitdeer’s chairman, Jihan Wu. The facility offers up to $200 million, backed by Bitdeer’s Sealminer hardware, with a floating interest rate of 9% plus market benchmarks. As of April 21, Bitdeer had drawn $43 million from the credit line. Source: Bitdeer’s Annual Report The latest funding adds to a $17 million unsecured loan obtained in January, alongside previous capital raises totaling $572.5 million via convertible notes in 2024. Bitdeer also issued over six million shares, raising nearly $119 million in equity markets this year. Related: Top Bitcoin miners produced nearly $800M of BTC in Q1 2025 Bitdeer acquires 101 MW Alberta power project In February 2025, Bitdeer acquired a fully licensed 101 megawatt (MW) gas-fired power project near Fox Creek, Alberta, for $21.7 million in cash, per the annual filing. The site, with potential to scale up to 1 gigawatt, includes all necessary permits for construction and a 99 MW grid connection. The power plant is set to be developed with an EPC partner and is expected to be operational by the fourth quarter of 2026. In March, the company also purchased 40 MW worth of liquid-cooled mining containers from Saiheat. More recently, it was reported that Bitdeer is expanding its self-mining operations and investing in United States-based production. The shift came in response to cooling demand for its mining hardware from other miners. “Our plan going forward is to prioritize our own self-mining,” Jeff LaBerge, Bitdeer’s head of capital markets and strategic initiatives, reportedly said. Additionally, on Feb. 28, 2025, Bitdeer launched a $20 million share repurchase program, effective through February 2026. To date, it has repurchased 1,056,500 Class A shares valued at about $12 million under this program. Related: American Bitcoin’s ambition is to dominate mining — Hut 8 CEO Bitcoin hashrate surges while miner revenues shrink Bitdeer’s expansion comes as Bitcoin’s network computing power hit a record 1 sextillion hashes per second in early April, according to BitInfoCharts. Bitcoin hashrate. Source: BitInfoCharts A higher hashrate indicates that more miners (or more powerful machines) are competing to solve Bitcoin blocks. As competition rises, each individual miner’s chance of earning block rewards decreases, implying declining profitability. Further hurting miner revenue are low transaction fees. As of now, the average Bitcoin transaction fee hovers around $1, down from over $16 per transfer in April last year, according to YCharts. The low transaction fees and rising hashrate forced public miners to sell over 40% of their BTC production in March — the highest since late 2024. Firms like Hive, Bitfarms and Ionic Digital reportedly sold more than 100% of their monthly output. Magazine: Altcoin season to hit in Q2?

The USD/JPY exchange rate plunged to 139.92 on Tuesday, its lowest level since September last year and 11.5% below its highest point in 2024. This decline aligns with the broader weakness of the U.S. dollar and a surge in other developed-world currencies such as the euro, British pound, and Swiss franc . The US dollar Index, a popular gauge that weighs its performance against a basket of currencies, fell to $98, its lowest point since April 2022. The ongoing yen rally is having significant ripple effects on equities, Bitcoin, and altcoins. In an X post, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes noted that this performance will push leveraged traders to unwind positions in U.S. stocks and bonds, ultimately leading to higher bond yields. I know Team Trump wants a weaker dollar, but a rapidly strengthening $JPY causes leveraged traders to unwind positions in US stocks and bonds. Thankfully $BTC knows that if bond yields rise, the BBC must print money.

U.S. stock prices have sharply declined, with the Nasdaq 100, S&P 500, and Dow Jones indices falling into technical correction territory. You might also like: Trump Media teams up with Crypto.com to launch digital asset ETFs According to the Financial Times , Japanese investors have offloaded over $20 billion in international bonds. Most of these sales were in US government bonds. These activities are watched closely because Japan is the biggest holder of US debt, worth $1.1 trillion. A key driver behind these sales is the strength of the yen and rising bond yields in Japan. The country’s 10-year government bond yield has risen to 1.30%, sharply higher than the lows seen last year. Bitcoin is slowly becoming a safe haven According to Hayes, the surging yen and the plunging US dollar will benefit Bitcoin ( BTC ) as the Federal Reserve will be forced to print money using quantitative easing. Meanwhile, there are increasing signs that Bitcoin is gradually evolving into a safe-haven asset. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded over $381 million in inflows on Monday, following $107 million on Friday. These inflows coincided with a sharp drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which fell by more than 1,000 points. Bitcoin has also dropped by less than 3% this year, while the top US indices have fallen by double digits. As such, some analysts believe that it will eventually evolve into a safe-haven asset, similar to gold. Such a move would lead to higher altcoin prices. Historically, altcoins like Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), and Pepe ( PEPE ) tend to perform well when Bitcoin is thriving.

However, its recent performance is quite alarming for investors and the industry in general. Dogecoin price touched the $0.4 mark earlier this year, but it has struggled below $0.2 for the last couple of months. While Doge and other top meme coins are losing investors’ confidence, Yeti Ouro’s (YETIO) presale has impressed one and all with its commendable performance, even in a bearish market. So, what is driving this change? Why is Yeti Ouro being seen as the next big thing in the blockchain gaming industry? Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE’s Ongoing Slump After peaking near $0.41 earlier this year, Dogecoin price is now around $0.1536 . It has dropped by over 78% from its all-time high prices. This slide is compounded by Dogecoin limited on‑chain utility, which leaves it vulnerable when pure hype subsides. Credits: CoinMarketCap Moreover, daily trading volumes for DOGE have also fallen dramatically from the record levels seen during its last major rally. Experts believe this is largely because of the fact that meme coins like Doge are heavily dependent on market sentiment. If the overall market does well, they witness positive movement. Similarly, in a bearish period, a slump is unavoidable because of the absence of a strong utility that can generate demand for it. Yeti Ouro’s Presale Success Yeti Ouro has rocked its presale by raising more than $3.4 million in Stage 3 completing at the end of the day today, even as the broader crypto market stumbles. This is because the project is much more than an average meme token. It has real utility in the form of its game, Yeti Go. Other than that, Yeti Ouro boasts a deflationary tokenomics model: 5% of its 1 billion total supply is reserved for burns, promoting scarcity to improve value in the long run. Such a framework, with the recent 30% Easter bonus for presale members, has drawn in both gamers and profit-hungry traders in a speedy fashion. Stage 4 commences tomorrow at the token price of $0.041. This gives early bird investors that purchased tokens in Stage 1 an ROI of almost 242%. Also, Yeti Ouro is audited by SOLIDProof , so customers can buy with confidence. Its tokenomics are simple too: 1 billion $YETIO tokens will exist, and 5% of total tokens will burn away over time to maintain the supply intact. At the core of Yeti Ouro is Yeti Go, a smooth-as-silk racing experience developed with Unreal Engine 5 by seasoned developers with high‑budget studio pedigrees. Gamers dive into elimination‑based heats, where real skill is rewarded with $YETIO per race. Those tokens aren’t merely decorative. They can be staked for additional rewards or bought with tasty in‑game goodies. Yeti Go throws you into the heart of a high-speed, visually stunning world where every detail is built for immersion. Developed in collaboration with the acclaimed studio behind gaming legends like Call of Duty, Spider-Man, The Witcher, and Dead Space, it’s crafted to deliver intensity from the ground up. The game’s soundscape—designed by top-tier engineers who’ve worked with Grammy-nominated artists including Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid—adds a cinematic layer that amplifies every moment. Scroll down to meet the lead character and enter its universe driven by precision, power, and pure momentum. In addition, the GameFi segment is also booming. While the gaming market as a whole is already gigantic and growing at an amazing rate, blockchain gaming is not too far behind either. And on top of all that, Yeti Ouro also lets you monetize out of the game. That makes it all the more thrilling, even for the casual gamer. Yeti Ouro’s design also benefits from viral growth. Friends challenge friends, streamers host races, and it gets spread organically. Most cryptocurrency tokens are dependent on traders entering and exiting, but Yeti Ouro binds token users for a day through gameplay. This play, earn, upgrade, repeat-cycle creates repeated demand for $YETIO, as compared to purely speculative coins. With audited security, open scarcity, and an actually enjoyable gaming experience, Yeti Ouro is a low-key crypto project for 2025 that actually provides real utility instead of hype.

According to CoinGlass data , the 11 Bitcoin-tracking ETFs saw a combined $381.3 million in net inflows on April 21, led by significant interest in the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), which alone attracted $116.1 million. This marks the largest daily inflow since January 30, when the ETFs collectively pulled in $588.1 million shortly after Bitcoin’s price surged past six figures. Bitcoin ETFs Face Headwinds Amid Trump’s Escalating Trade War Rhetoric Recent weeks, however, have been challenging for Bitcoin ETFs, as investor sentiment was dampened by U.S. President Donald Trump’s escalating trade war rhetoric. Bitcoin dipped below $100,000 in early February and hit a yearly low of $74,773 on April 7 following widespread tariffs and a downturn in traditional markets. Other major ETF players also saw renewed inflows on April 21. The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) secured $87.6 million, while Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and its Mini Trust ETF (BTC) brought in a combined $69.1 million. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest Bitcoin ETF by assets, recorded $41.6 million in net inflows—down from pre-weekend levels but still signaling steady demand.

Over the three-day weekend, total crypto market capitalization grew by $800 billion, reaching $2.84 trillion. Bitcoin played a key role in this surge, climbing above $88,500 for the first time in four weeks and pushing its market capitalization past $1.75 trillion. The strong ETF inflows and market performance suggest growing investor confidence in Bitcoin, even amid broader macroeconomic uncertainty. Digital Asset Investment Products See Modest Inflows Digital asset investment products saw modest inflows of $6 million last week, reflecting mixed investor sentiment. Early-week inflows reversed after strong U.S. retail sales data triggered $146 million in outflows mid-week. The U.S. led with $71 million in outflows, while Europe and Canada showed optimism, with Switzerland, Germany, and Canada posting significant inflows. Bitcoin experienced fluctuating sentiment, ending the week with $6 million in outflows, while Short Bitcoin products marked a seventh consecutive week of outflows. Ethereum continued its downturn, losing $26.7 million, bringing its eight-week outflow total to $772 million. Despite this, Ethereum still holds strong YTD inflows. In contrast, XRP stood out, attracting $37.7 million in inflows, making it the third-best performing asset this year with $214 million YTD inflows.

In an investor note dated Tuesday, April 22, Geoff Kendrick, the bank’s Global Head of Digital Assets Research, set a $200,000 price target for Bitcoin by the end of 2025, citing the asset’s evolving role as a hedge against financial risks in the private and government sectors. This bold prediction comes as Bitcoin bulls and bears continue to battle over the asset’s next trajectory. At the time of reporting, BTC was valued at $88,740, up 1.7% in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Kendrick highlighted the cryptocurrency’s resilience during financial instability, crediting its decentralized ledger system. Notably, the leading digital asset has remained mainly in a state of consolidation , while equities experienced massive volatility as trade tensions between the U.S. and China put increasing pressure on global financial systems. He pointed to two key risk drivers behind Bitcoin’s rise: private sector shocks, such as the 2023 Silicon Valley Bank collapse, and government-related pressures, including concerns over the independence of the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve. Impact of Trump’s influence on the Fed A major concern is the potential replacement of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, which the bank’s Global Head of Digital Assets Research warns could further erode confidence in the central bank’s autonomy. To this end, markets remain on edge as President Donald Trump pushes for Powell’s exit due to disagreements over monetary policy, particularly interest rates. These concerns have driven the 10-year U.S. Treasury term premium to a 12-year high, closely mirroring BTC’s rise since early 2024. Though Bitcoin recently lagged behind the surging term premium, partly due to tariff-related pressure on tech stocks, Kendrick expects it to surpass previous highs as concerns over central bank independence continue to build. Notably, Kendrick’s long-term outlook is even more bullish, projecting a $500,000 Bitcoin price by the end of 2028. His forecasts carry weight, particularly after Standard Chartered accurately predicted that the digital asset would hit $100,000 by the end of 2024, driven by institutional inflows. If Bitcoin reaches a valuation of $200,000, its new market cap would be approximately $3.8 trillion.

At this point, with the divergence of the correlation between Bitcoin and traditional stocks, BTC gained more than 5 percent in the last week and rose to $90,000 for the first time since March 7. While Bitcoin is rising along with gold, which is running from record to record, it remains unclear whether this rise is permanent or temporary. The rise in Bitcoin was also evident in altcoins, with Ethereum (ETH) rising to $1650, XRP to $2.13, and Solana (SOL) to $143. Possible reasons for the rise in Bitcoin include the increasing correlation of BTC with gold, the increasing expectation that the Fed will cut interest rates in May, and the resumption of spot Bitcoin ETF inflows. While the rise in Bitcoin and altcoins left short investors in a bind, $321 million was liquidated in the last 24 hours. Of this, $184 million were short positions and $137 million were long positions. Again, 109,848 investors liquidated in the last 24 hours, with the largest liquidation occurring in the ETH/USDT trading pair on Bybit. *This is not investment advice.

According to CoinGecko, its dominance over the rest of the market currently stands at 61.6% and has been increasing through the day as well. This signals that BTC is outperforming the altcoin market. As CryptoPotato reported earlier today, Bitcoin’s dominance is at a 4-year peak, signaling strong investor confidence in the primary cryptocurrency. Source: TradingView Speaking of altcoins, most of them are in the green as well. Ethereum is charting a 1.5% increase, XRP is up by 1%, while SOL and DOGE are performing better, surging by almost 4% each. This move has caused an uptick in liquidated positions across the derivatives market, which currently stand at around $320 million, according to data from CoinGlass. Naturally, the majority of these are short positions accounting for around $190 million of the total.

Oregon AG lawsuit against Coinbase calls XRP unregistered security Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield’s lawsuit against Coinbase argues that XRP and other digital assets are unregistered securities. Rayield sued US-based, publicly traded crypto exchange Coinbase for allegedly violating Oregon’s securities law. In an April 18 announcement , the Oregon Department of Justice said the suit was part of an effort to fill what it described as a regulatory vacuum left by federal agencies under the Trump administration: “States must fill enforcement vacuum being left by federal regulators who are abandoning these cases under Trump administration,“ the department said. Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal voiced his frustration over the lawsuit in an April 21 X post. Justin Slaughter, the vice president of regulatory affairs at crypto investment firm Paradigm, pointed out that the lawsuit claims a long list of digital assets, including XRP ( XRP ), are unregistered securities. Source: Paul Grewal Yarden Noy, partner at crypto legal firm DLT Law, told Cointelegraph that if the court ruled these assets are securities, it “would mostly create more confusion in this regard.” It would not be a binding precedent in other cases, not even within Oregon, he added. Paul Atkins, nominated by Trump, sworn in as SEC chair Paul Atkins has officially been sworn in as the 34th chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The April 21 announcement comes nearly two weeks after Atkins’ position was confirmed by the US Senate in a 52-44 vote on April 9. Source: US House Committee on Financial Services Republicans “I am honored by the trust and confidence President Trump and the Senate have placed in me to lead the SEC,” said Atkins, who served as an SEC commissioner between 2002 and 2008.

Consensys, Solana, Uniswap CEO donated to Trump's $239 million inauguration fund New filings from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) reveal that several cryptocurrency firms and their executives made significant contributions to US President Donald Trump’s inauguration fund after the results of the 2024 election. According to FEC filings made public on April 20 by the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee, Uniswap CEO Hayden Adams donated more than $245,000, Solana Labs donated $1 million, and software firm Consensys sent $100,000 in January to support the then-president-elect’s inauguration. Many major crypto firms had previously announced their support of Trump through donations to the inaugural fund, including Coinbase, Ripple Labs, Kraken, Ondo Finance, and Robinhood. Altogether, the fund reported more than $239 million in net donations between Nov. 15 and April 20 from companies and individuals. These included $1 million from McDonald’s, $1 million from Meta, $1 million from Apple CEO Tim Cook, $1 million from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and various contributions from Delta Air Lines, ExxonMobil, FedEx, Nvidia, PayPal, Target, and Coca-Cola.

It has made significant strides in landing partnerships, growing community engagement, and driving ahead with technical developments. It has gone from breaking some clean records to forging what seem to be some pretty solid new alliances. And on the whole, it has been starting to feel like a very legitimate player, not only in the DeFi space but also on the broader blockchain stage. Aptos Joins Blockchain Days 2025 as Platinum Sponsor Aptos has ensured its foothold in the blockchain fraternity by becoming a platinum backer of the imminent Blockchain Days 2025 occurrence. Set to haul in top brass, coders, and devotees from all over, this gathering will serve as a one-off chance for Aptos to unfurl its banner before, uh, an enhanced constellation of onlookers. And that’s, umm, because Aptos ain’t just playing it safe as a backend sponsor; it’s up front and center as a, uh, platinum patron, larger than life, larger than, um, small talk in the hallways. The mission of Aptos is to create a scalable, secure, and user-friendly blockchain and to further that mission in a deeper collaboration with the industry. Aptos’ commitment to innovation and its vision for the larger blockchain community make it a platform sponsor. It is a major supporter. Blockchain Days 2025 will be a key assembler. Aptos Breaks New Records with 75 Million Wallets Aptos has reached yet another impressive milestone—this time, 75 million wallets within its network. This new record is all about the growing adoption of Aptos’ blockchain among both users and developers. The rate of increase in the number of wallets within the network really looks to be accelerating. This also appears to be quite a sharp uptick in activity within the Apto system. This pace of expansion seems very much in concert with recent developments in the larger Apto ecosystem and is being built up partly on the basis of an impressively expanding DeFi and NFT architecture. Reaching this milestone is a testament to how resilient the Aptos network is and the increasing trust it is earning from the blockchain community. Each new wallet also means that Aptos is not just scalable but also reliable, and those are two tentpole characteristics any successful blockchain must have to attract a growing user base and continue the further expansion of its ecosystem. Meso Finance Enhances DeFi Experience on Aptos Aptos is augmenting its DeFi ecosystem with a new trick called Meso Finance, a freshly launched DeFi platform on the network. Meso Finance’s clear target is user experience, especially with the thing most of us care about in DeFi: making money. Meso has a bunch of tools and interfaces it serves users, but at its core is this thing called Layered AMM, which is trying to do something very Forked Up (more on that later). At the inciting moment of this story, though, Meso AMM had significantly more MAUs than Meso MAKER and Meso Stakes. Incorporating Meso Finance into the Aptos ecosystem is yet another sign of the budding decentralized finance movement on this layer-1 blockchain.

What this means is that Aptos users can now use Meso’s DeFi tools and services. Since Meso is brand new and just getting started, we don’t really know what kind of liquidity or number of users it will bring to Aptos. However, it could bring either, or both. Lottery Trading Contest with Hyperion.xyz Aptos has partnered with Hyperion.xyz to run a Lottery Trading Contest, which is yet another way to enhance engagement within its community. The contest, designed to attract traders and reward participants, is one of the many initiatives that Aptos has taken on to promote activity and growth within its ecosystem. Collaborating with Hyperion.xyz shows how Aptos works with others across its ecosystem to create value for users. Why does this matter? Because events like these, with their bountiful rewards and sweet incentives, are just what the community needs to get behind a project, ensuring it has a user base and ecosystem it can call its own. Amnis Finance NFT 3rd Prize Pool Announced A collaboration between Aptos and Amnis Finance continues to bear fruit, with the announcement of the third prize pool for their NFT contest. Amnis Finance is using the Aptos blockchain to deliver the sorts of experiences you would expect only from the finance world with regards to NFTs. And this relationship has permitted Aptos to push further into the NFT space. Amnis Finance continues to make use of the fast and secure Aptos blockchain. Excitement rippled through the community on the announcement of the prize pool, and rightly so! It is yet another sign that the intersection of DeFi, NFTs, and Aptos’ blockchain is not only real but also thriving. And it’s not just us who think this: more and more projects like Amnis Finance are integrating with Aptos, further testament to the appeal and versatility of our blockchain. Aptos Takes Center Stage at JR Osaka Station Aptos captured the headlines in Japan by setting up shop at JR Osaka Station, one of the country’s major and most recognizable transportation hubs. The blockchain made a splash with both locals and tourists, demonstrating its international expansion. And this wasn’t some kind of web3 billboard; Aptos was engaging with the Japanese public, trying to make its name synonymous with the blockbuster potential of blockchain technology. By taking up such a prestigious position, Aptos is showing its desire to stretch beyond its base in the West and reach into the abundant prospects of Asia, which, let us assure you, is of no little importance in the modern blockchain and cryptocurrency world. Aave Now Live on Aptos with ARFC In another big step forward, the ARFC (Aptos DeFi Collective) has officially deployed Aave on the Aptos blockchain. Aave, one of the top DeFi lending platforms, is now live on Aptos, bringing with it a whole lot of lending and borrowing opportunities for users of the network. This deployment boosts the DeFi powers of Aptos, giving users access to some of the most well-known and well-trusted DeFi protocols in the market. Aave’s availability on Aptos is a huge deal for Aptos users. Aave’s entry into the Aptos ecosystem emphasizes Aptos’s recent pivot to decentralized finance and signals that it is now a viable host for such applications. Aave is the most recent high-profile DeFi protocol to enter the Aptos ecosystem, following several others that have recently set up shop there. Looking Ahead Aptos is clearly headed upward, hitting major milestones and forming strategic partnerships that help it grow and innovate. The week just past in April saw some developments that crystalize its commitment to build a pretty rich ecosystem that embraces DeFi, NFTs, and a good chunk of worldwide market engagement. Aptos is not just filling out the space between its major developments and the time when it hooks up with yet another major development; it is growing and continuing to attract new users. And in doing so, it’s looking set to play a pretty major role in the next evolution of the blockchain space. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This benchmark not only underscores the network’s vital role in stablecoin circulation but also complements the user demand that BNB Chain clearly fulfills—a demand for low-fee, almost instant blockchain infrastructure that enables seamless stablecoin transactions. As recently compiled on-chain data shows, the unique active USDT addresses across all the supported chains have reached a total of 31.1 million. Of that, a massive 74%—or 23.2 million—of that total is shared between BNB Chain and TRON DAO, both of which networks not only account for a sizable chunk of overall stablecoin usage, but also demonstrate how much BNB Chain and TRON DAO have advanced to the next step in their respective roadmaps. BNB Chain hits 12M active USDT addresses In the last 30 days, @BNBCHAIN recorded 12M active $USDT addresses, while the total number of unique active $USDT addresses across all chains reached 31.1M. Together, @BNBCHAIN and @trondao account for 74% (23.2M) of all active $USDT … pic.twitter.com/gtmnTjywKg — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) April 20, 2025 BNB Chain and TRON DAO Lead Stablecoin Adoption Many blockchain ecosystems derive their lifeblood from stablecoins, especially in places where you can’t rely on traditional banking infrastructure. They use USDT as a dollar-pegged bridge between their decentralized platforms and the world of traditional finance. It, therefore, remains the most widely used stablecoin. Stablecoins and USDT have become the lifeblood of many blockchain ecosystems. USDT addresses being active on the BNB chain illustrate its positioning in today’s crypto market. Regarding these addresses, the usual critique of the BNB chain—concerning its low on-chain activity—does not apply. For a sufficiently lengthy period, the BNB chain has evidently been a competitive settlement layer for many real-world use cases, not just for DeFi applications. Seemingly, the settlement experience on the BNB chain can rival that on Ethereum. At the same time, the TRON DAO also cannot be overlooked in this space. As a major player in its own right, TRON has seen its usage of USDT surge steadily for several years, and much of that surge is coming from exactly the same regions that BNB Chain is finding utility in: Southeast Asia and Latin America. Adoptions in these areas have been primarily for remittances and peer-to-peer transfers. Together, TRON and BNB Chain provide a significant portion of the real-world USDT utility that exists today. Solana Loses Ground to Arbitrum, Polygon, and Celo Although BNB Chain and TRON continue to hold the upper hand, competition is tightening among the other Layer-1 and Layer-2 platforms. To our surprise, Arbitrum, Polygon (0xPolygon), and Celo all surpassed Solana in terms of active USDT addresses for the 30-day period ending October 3. 2023. This might suggest that users are not only leaving the second-largest Layer-1 platform in the world for these addresses but also flocking to those ecosystems for whatever reason. One of the Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solutions, Arbitrum, is the fastest-growing alternative across the Ethereum ecosystem. It has positioned itself as a viable route for dApp users looking to avoid the high fees of Ethereum mainnet transactions. With the growing ecosystem of dApps on Arbitrum and the significantly lower fees compared to Ethereum’s mainnet, Arbitrum is that alternative for users who stay within the Ethereum ecosystem. Developers and users have long favored Polygon for its compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), for its scalability, and for the diverse decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming applications that run on it. The number of active addresses holding USDT on Polygon continues to rise, showing that USDT—if not the stablecoin holy grail—remains a key part of the crypto economics that underpin unregulated, affordable, reliable, and somewhat private economic activity. Celo, a mobile-first blockchain focused on financial inclusion, also experienced a surge in USDT usage. Its recent uptick could be traced to its burgeoning penetration of emerging markets and an intensified interest from mission-focused projects working to serve unbanked global citizens. Space previously allocated to Solana, once considered a contender for the future of crypto due to its swift and inexpensive transactions, now appears to be more modestly occupied. Solana certainly boasts a sincere user and developer base; however, recent advancement problems seem to have reduced the amount of interaction between stablecoins and Solana. Without a fresh supply of stablecoins in the Solana ecosystem, the situation could amount to a vicious cycle. Looking Ahead Stablecoins are playing a foundational role in the digital economy, and the networks that stablecoins move on will be crucial to the broader blockchain infrastructure. The BNB Chain has 12 million active addresses with USDT, which speaks to two things: the chain’s operational efficiency and its market position. TRON, Arbitrum, Polygon, and Celo are also making amazing progress. Competition among the networks for stablecoin activity is bound to intensify. In the end, the winners are going to be those platforms that offer their users the trifecta of speed, affordability, and security—characteristics that the leading chains in today’s crypto landscape all seem to have.

43669890,https://nulltx.com/?p=148158,1745331118,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,TRON Leads Stablecoin Expansion with $4.26B Surge in Market Cap Over 30 Days,https://nulltx.com/tron-leads-stablecoin-expansion-with-4-26b-surge-in-market-cap-over-30-days/,"In a potent surge of forward movement, TRON has jumped to the front of the stablecoin pack, notching up a huge $4.26 billion increase in stablecoin market capitalization in just the last 30 days. But what’s really stunning about the TRON stablecoin ecosystem is the rapidly growing adoption of stablecoins on the TRON network globally, in everything from decentralized finance to everyday payments. The achievement that TRON has secured cements its position as an outstanding platform during a period when several other leading blockchains, including Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Optimism, have seen stablecoin usage dip significantly. This is not just a decline for some of TRON’s biggest competitors. This is a pretty visible divergence, and user behavior and capital flow appear to be shifting. Users favor TRON over these other leading platforms. Tether Activity Drives TRON’s Growth The major reason why TRON’s stablecoin capitalization is soaring is that it is closely tied to Tether (USDT), the largest and most mainstream stablecoin. Today, Tether very much busy at work on TRON, as it has minted something to the tune of 1 billion USDT, which is obviously as part of the said issuance that now is happening on the TRON network. All told, since the end of the last week of January 2025, roughly 10 billion USDT have been made available to the public, with many of them being made available via issuance on the TRON network. TRON’s low transaction costs and efficient infrastructure make it an ideal network for stablecoin transfers—especially in the parts of the world where fast, low-cost remittances and everyday payments are crucial. In many places across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, USDT on TRON is now the default medium of exchange and has largely displaced fiat currency for digital transactions. The current minting undertaken by Tether reflects not just a burgeoning demand on the TRON network, but a strategic method for Tether to keep emergent markets and DeFi protocols running on TRON sufficiently liquid. Other Chains See Mixed Performance Although TRON’s numbers were great, other networks seemed to be doing something rather different. In terms of stablecoin adoption, they showed a mixed bag of results. Solana, for instance, during the same 30-day time span, added $478 million to its stablecoin market cap. That’s a figure that, while far behind TRON, still suggests Solana’s in good health and growing—especially since its community has had ample opportunities over the last two years to bash it. TRON stablecoin market cap up $4B in a month Over the past 30 days, @trondao stablecoin market cap grew by $4.26B, while @solana added $478M. In contrast, @ethereum , @arbitrum , and @Optimism saw declines. @SuiNetwork and @SonicLabs also posted growth, while @Aptos reached $1B… pic.twitter.com/MWTaF5MfSD — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) April 21, 2025 Contrarily, stablecoin market caps on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Optimism are falling. The drop on Ethereum may be attributable to rising gas fees and competition from other chains that are cheaper, faster, and more reliable. Arbitrum and Optimism, two major Layer 2 scaling solutions for Ethereum, suffered as well, as users and liquidity seemed to head to other places that offer more compelling incentives—reasons that might be tied to the kind of decentralized finance (DeFi) opportunities those other places offer. AltCoin networks have seen a sharp uptick in blockchain activity over the last few months. The most pronounced uptick from October to November was on the Sui Network, a new-generation blockchain platform, which nearly tripled its overall user activity in that month. Another uptick was seen on the Sonic Labs platform from the same time frame. This decentralized nature of AltCoin networks can be further substantiated by looking at the activity gains on some of the newer blockchain ecosystems. Incentives and improved user experience seem to be driving the uptick in stablecoin activity on these platforms. Aptos Hits $1B, Unichain Surges Amid Incentives Campaign Aptos, one of the up-and-coming names in the Layer-1 space, achieved a significant moment by reaching $1 billion in stablecoin market capitalization for the first time. This growth emphasizes the platform’s strengthening allure to developers and users, particularly as it enhances its DeFi engagements and partnerships. At the same time, Unichain saw its stablecoin market cap increase by $152 million—an achievement that was basically pulled off by the execution of a new incentive program. By using user rewards and liquidity mining as the twin engines of its incentive program, Unichain has managed to not just lure in fresh capital but also to get fresh user activity onto its platform. These developments reflect the emerging competitive landscape of blockchain, where the ecosystems are vying to draw in stablecoin liquidity. They attract that liquidity by offering the kind of superior infrastructure, incentives, and easy-to-use products that make you prefer doing your business in one ecosystem over another. Stablecoins Power the Next Phase of Crypto Adoption TRON’s stablecoin market cap increased by $4.26 billion, showcasing its ecosystem strength, and stablecoins’ central role in pushing blockchain adoption is highlighted again. As the digitation of the global financial system continues, stablecoins are becoming the bridge between traditional finance and blockchain-native finance. Stablecoins are now a cornerstone of the broader crypto-economy, whether they are used for remittances, payments, savings, or decentralized finance. Those blockchains that best facilitate stablecoin use are now reaping the benefits. As TRON and Tether soldier on in front, issuing stablecoins and developing their adoption, newer chains like Aptos and Unichain are mounting a challenge and gaining traction through innovation and incentives. This makes the stablecoin landscape not only more competitive but also more essential. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Yaxhtzee pic.twitter.com/iYCXqGxsws — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) April 21, 2025 Buybacks are part of a slew of programs launched by the US Treasury Department to boost liquidity, stabilize interest rates, and avoid trading disruptions in the world’s largest bond market, the bedrock of the global financial system. These initiatives can inject liquidity into the financial system, typically allowing investor capital to rotate into hard assets such as Bitcoin and gold. According to CoinGecko data, the premier crypto is up 3.3% in the past 24 hours to trade at $90,230. This marks the first time BTC has soared above the $90K mark since March 7. Bitcoin Safe Haven Narrative Making A Comeback It’s also worth noting that Bitcoin’s price jump above $87,000 has reignited discussions of its role as a potential safe haven. Crypto trading firm QCP Capital claimed in its latest bulletin to Telegram that BTC is seemingly sharing some of gold’s historical role as a hedge against economic uncertainty — a huge narrative in the top crypto’s early years, but one that has lost steam in recent months. “With equities finishing last week in the red and extending an April drawdown, the narrative of BTC as a safe haven or inflation hedge is once again gaining traction. Should this dynamic hold, it could provide a fresh tailwind for institutional BTC allocation,” QCP Capital postulated. The strategists further noted that institutional trust is returning, as evidenced by the US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) registering inflows after weeks of massive withdrawals. “Indeed, we’re already seeing early signs of institutional confidence returning. Spot BTC ETF flows turned positive last week with net inflows of $13.4 million, a stark contrast to the previous week’s $708 million in outflows,” the bulletin summarized. Despite the recent bounce, Bitcoin remains 17% below its record of around $109,000 in January.",Bitcoin|News|Arthur Hayes|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-22 14:12:31

This renewed interest appears to be stemming from several places: • Institutional investors like Galaxy Digital are significantly increasing their exposure to the network’s native SOL token (as seen in the next section). • Various cross-chain metrics suggest Solana is gaining momentum again after a tough 2023, with Ethereum-based projects like Aave and Curve having migrated to the Solana blockchain as of just this past week. Solana’s decentralized apps (dApps) are raking in the revenues, and its native token is being diligently traded by whales. All’s well in Solana City, and there’s a good chance we’re heading toward a Solana future. For the Solana Layer-1 blockchain, all signs and portents right now point to an increase in user demand for its high-throughput trading capabilities. Galaxy Digital Adds $95M in $SOL Amid Growing Institutional Demand The digital asset investment firm, Galaxy Digital, which is led by Mike Novogratz, seems to be confidently betting on Solana. Just in the past week, the firm has taken off from centralized exchanges about $95 million worth of $SOL, and in the same week, has also taken off from centralized exchanges approximately $40 million worth of $MATIC. Mathematics is not a betting firm. It is a digital asset investment intelligence firm, and its calculations are made with an eye on the coming years, if not decades. The latest development is that Galaxy has taken yet another 123,058 $SOL (worth $17.1 million) from Binance, bringing their total even higher. In fact, this suggests that they see Solana’s ecosystem as something they might derive “long-term” value from—even if the rest of the crypto market remains buffeted by volatility and all the usual macroeconomic uncertainties. The withdrawals’ timing is noteworthy. With Solana priced approximately at $141 during the most recent transaction, it’s clear that Galaxy is investing with serious intent, even as values near the top of the chart for this year. When a respected institution trades like this, it sends a strong message to the rest of the market. Whale Returns to Solana After Strategic $USDC Exit It is not only institutional investors that are confident. One significant stakeholder also made waves when it withdrew 374,161 SOL—worth about $52.78 million—from Binance at around the $141 price point. This was not long after that same stakeholder exited a large position by selling 451,594 SOL for about $51.86 million in USDC at around $115 between April 9 and April 13. This sequence of events denotes a clear and copacetic trading strategy: offload large amounts of an asset at what appears to be a local price peak, and then reaccumulate that same asset at a price that is clearly much lower and likely to rise again soon. The first part of the sequence suggests that the Solana whale is too smart to sell at anything other than a local price peak possibility. While the price is at it, the whale is likely out of the market until he or she sees signs that the price has begun to rise again after having dropped from local peak to local trough. Over $100M Bridged to Solana as dApp Revenue Soars Solana isn’t just rising because investors are interested; it’s also rising because people are using it. In the past week, over $100 million has been crossed to the Solana network from other chains. Of that, more than $50 million came directly from Ethereum, which is notable in itself—but in the last week, Solana has been seeing more than $10 million a day crossed over from Ethereum. Bridged asset supply is nevertheless surging, and the Solana dApp performance is a big reason why. The most significant driver of revenue has been @pumpdotfun, which has managed to reel in an astonishing $12.57 million over the past week. @AxiomExchange is producing similar performance just slightly behind, raking in $8.48 million. And @JupiterExchange continues to churn out appearances in our revenue top three, this time with $4.24 million that puts it in third place. These numbers show not just how users are engaging with Solana but how they’re really doing things that matter economically and happening right on its blockchain. What we see here is the ecosystem bubbling along and doing things together that are mostly legal, for the most part (LOL), and economically productive. This is not an accident. Looking Ahead The gathering together of whales, the buying of institutions, and the increasing on-chain revenues all seem to conspire to create what’s called a Solana hate. Although the market keeps evolving, it promises continued momentum for Solana, which appears not only to be surviving the multichain race but also seems to be leading it. With Galaxy Digital, Solana whales, and a vigorous user base behind it, the network seems primed for another leg up in the months to come. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

If you’re fascinated by both, then you’ll want to pay attention to this latest development. Pundi AI, a platform focused on decentralized AI data annotation, has just announced a groundbreaking partnership with Hooked Protocol , a Web3 social learning platform. Together, they are launching a new learning module within Hooked Protocol’s Hooked 2.0 ecosystem, titled “Democratizing AI: The Future of Decentralized Intelligence with Pundi AI .” This collaboration aims to make AI learning more accessible and inclusive, leveraging the power of Web3. Let’s dive into what this partnership means for the future of education and the decentralized AI space. What is Pundi AI and Why Decentralized AI Matters? Before we delve into the specifics of this collaboration, let’s understand the key players. Pundi AI is building a decentralized AI data annotation platform. But what exactly does that mean, and why is decentralization so crucial in the realm of AI? Data Annotation in AI: AI models are trained on massive datasets. Data annotation is the process of labeling and categorizing this data, which is essential for AI to learn effectively. For example, in image recognition, annotators might draw boxes around objects in images and label them (e.g., “cat,” “dog,” “car”). Centralized vs. Decentralized Annotation: Traditionally, data annotation is often centralized, meaning it’s controlled by a few large companies. This can lead to issues like data bias, lack of transparency, and limited accessibility for contributors. The Power of Decentralization: Decentralized AI annotation, like what Pundi AI is pioneering, aims to distribute the power and benefits of AI data annotation. It leverages blockchain technology to create a more transparent, secure, and equitable system. This can lead to: Increased Transparency: All data annotation processes can be recorded on the blockchain, making them auditable and transparent. Fairer Compensation: Contributors can be directly rewarded for their annotation work, cutting out intermediaries and ensuring fairer pay. Data Security and Privacy: Blockchain’s inherent security features can enhance data protection and user privacy in AI annotation. Global Accessibility: Decentralized platforms can open up annotation opportunities to a global workforce, fostering inclusivity.

43671930,https://nulltx.com/?p=148156,1745335383,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Solana’s DEX Wars Intensify as Pumpfun and Orca Challenge Raydium’s Dominance,https://nulltx.com/solanas-dex-wars-intensify-as-pumpfun-and-orca-challenge-raydiums-dominance/,"The decentralized exchange (DEX) landscape on Solana is undergoing a major shakeup. While things are still very much in flux, the once-unshakable dominance of Raydium is facing serious pressure from emerging platforms that are quickly carving out significant market share. From April 14 to April 20, 2025, Raydium remained the largest DEX on Solana by trading volume. But for the first time in over a year, its position is no longer unchallenged. Market data from last week put Raydium at 31% of total DEX volume on Solana—still leading but down sharply from its 2025 peak of 63%. That dramatic 50% drop in market share shows just how rapidly things have changed in recent months. And of course, “things” refers to competitors that have emerged on Solana and are rapidly taking business from Raydium. The present DEX volume breakdown shows a diverse and splintered ecosystem: – Raydium: 31% – Pumpfun (Launchpad + AMM): 19% – Orca: 16% – Meteora: 12% – SolFi: 11% – Others: 11% 1/ @solana 's DEX landscape has never been this competitive. Here's the market share snapshot from last week (Apr 14 – Apr 20, 2025): – Raydium: 31% – Pumpfun (launchpad + AMM): 19% – Orca: 16% – Meteora: 12% – SolFi: 11% – Others: 11% Let's dive into the data pic.twitter.com/IuAnXT9G3e — Blockworks Research (@blockworksres) April 21, 2025 Pumpfun Emerges as a Powerhouse The most notable development in this changing scene is the emergence of Pumpfun, a new player that has quickly surged to the number two spot on the leaderboard. Just weeks after launching its automated market maker (AMM), Pumpfun has become responsible for 19% of total DEX volume on Solana. Last week alone, it hit a record-breaking $4.3 billion in trading volume, which stands as an all-time high for the platform. Pumpfun owes its success to a hybrid model. On the one hand, it is a memecoin-focused launchpad, and on the other, a high-speed AMM. These two functionalities have managed to siphon off the rabid retail interest in low-cap tokens, while at the same time offering traders efficient liquidity. In the Solana ecosystem, where retail passion projects have historically gone to die, what Imperium Labs has built with Pumpfun is of dangerous potential. The really big question now is: can Pumpfun keep—if not increase—its market share in the face of a competitive and often rapidly shifting crypto landscape? With such explosive early growth, much of its future success will depend on how well it can hold onto liquidity providers, bring in serious traders, and develop in ways that don’t rely on its meme-centered past. And of course, the same questions apply to the many other projects in the Pumpfun space. Orca and SolFi Duel Over SOL-USD Dominance In the world beyond the memecoin frenzy, dominance is up for grabs in core trading pairs like SOL-USD—and Orca, a decentralized exchange, currently has a slight edge. About 27% of the trading volume for this pair happens on Orca, with another decentralized exchange, SolFi, nudging just behind at 26%. But these numbers are so close that they won’t be doing SolFi any disservice if, throughout this essay, I just shorthand for both as “decentralized exchanges serving the SOL-USD market.” Orca has emerged as a leader in several other significant categories, especially in Project Token markets like JLP and JTO, and in Liquid Staking Token (LST) swaps. This leadership across several verticals highlights the appeal of Orca to a broader user base and suggests that its base is well-diversified beyond just one niche. In the meantime, SolFi has taken great strides to establish itself as a key player in providing stablecoin and major pair liquidity. SolFi’s rapid growth in volume and usage speaks to a rising demand for DeFi platforms with simplified, clean interfaces, and trading mechanics that perform to the level of—if not better than—those on the “traditional” trading platforms. Raydium’s Position Still Strong—But Fading Even though its market share continues to shrink, Raydium remains far from insignificant. It still commands 31% of the total market and leads the Solana DEX scene. But its present looking quite more vulnerable than its September 2024 situation, with market share hovering below 33%. The last time Raydium’s market share dipped this low, it was February 2024. Raydium must face the challenge of modernizing when traders demand it. The current evolution of decentralized exchanges means that if there are to be seen promising new features, stellar incentives, and smooth collaborations with the expanding DeFi portfolio promised by Solana, DEXs need to evolve and adapt. No one wants to use an old DEX. Everybody wants to trade with new features. They want a user interface that is as crisp and inviting as it is clear. And if you think DEXs can work with a bad user experience, I’ve got a proposal for you: How about the next Solana DEX not work? A More Competitive Future for Solana DeFi The DEX market in Solana has become incredibly competitive, and that’s a positive development. Users have more options now than ever before, and new projects are appearing all the time. In fact, the speed at which protocols are being launched can make one dizzy. But what’s really impressive is that not only are these new protocols appearing, but all contenders in Solana’s DeFi space seem intent on innovating rapidly and retaining users. The next few months will be very important in determining whether this new fragmentation settles into a small number of dominant players or continues to support a multi-DEX ecosystem in which specialization counts. One thing is for sure: this race is not over by a long shot. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The bank is demanding a rewrite of MiCA, whose stablecoin provisions came into force last June and which took full effect at the end of last year, a position that brings it into conflict with the European Commission, Politico reported , citing a policy paper. Neither the ECB nor the commission responded to a CoinDesk request for comment. The central bank is concerned U.S. legislation currently working through Congress, such as the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy Act ( STABLE ) and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS) could see the influence of dollar-backed stablecoins growing further. The stablecoin sector could surge 10-fold to reach $2 trillion within three years following the passage of the legislation, Standard Chartered forecast. At an April 14 meeting with top officials from EU governments to discuss U.S. support for crypto, the ECB circulated a document that argued that MiCA needed a serious re-think, Politico said, citing two diplomats and an EU official who were not identified. It was not a popular position. ""Not very many [countries] supported the idea that we should now jump the gun and start making quick changes in [the rules] based on this alone,” one of the diplomats said. The Commission argued that it was still “too early” to judge the effect the U.S. crypto environment would have on EU financial stability and only one global stablecoin has been authorized under the new rules. Circle, issuer of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin, snagged the first stablecoin license under MiCA in July last year . “The risks arising from such global stablecoins seem to be overstated and are manageable under the existing legal framework,” the Commission said in a document distributed at the meeting.

The US 10-year Treasury note yield stood at 4.41% on Tuesday, April 22, based on over-the-counter interbank quotations for the benchmark government bond. Global investors are interested in who holds the debt underpinning the US government’s massive borrowing program and what could happen if those holders begin to exit. US Treasurys, often considered the ultimate safe-haven asset, are valued by their minimal credit risk. They are backed by the full faith and credit of the government and help finance federal expenditures. US Treasury market is on its way back to January highs Turbulence in financial markets, caused by US President Trump and his plan to scale down trade deficits, has placed the Treasury market in limbo. Historically, this kind of political upheaval typically drives investors toward Treasurys, pushing yields down in turn. This time, the trend reversed course. Yields on 10-year Treasurys dipped below 4% before rising and peaking near 4.7%, just 0.1% less than levels it had reached a week before Trump entered the White House. US Dollar Index 5-year chart. Source: Tradingeconomics.com Foreign holders of US Treasurys account for about 33% of all outstanding debt. However, recent market signals suggest that global investors may be pulling back. 🚨Who owns the US Treasury market? Foreigners hold 33% of Treasury bonds with Japan and China being the largest holders. China owns ~$760 billion of US government bonds. The country likely holds another $500 billion (difficult to estimate) through EU countries such as Belgium. pic.twitter.com/eCISj4wfoH — Global Markets Investor (@GlobalMktObserv) April 13, 2025 Through the end of February, just before the recent sell-off, Treasury Department data revealed the top 10 foreign holders of US debt. Japan is the largest at $1.125 trillion, followed by China at $784 billion, and the United Kingdom at $750 billion. The Cayman Islands, Luxembourg, Canada, Belgium, France, Ireland, and Taiwan rounded out the top 10, each holding between $295 billion and $418 billion. Several other countries also hold substantial amounts, including Switzerland ($291 billion), Hong Kong ($274 billion), Singapore ($260 billion), and India ($228 billion). The combined holdings of all other countries stood at $1.642 trillion, bringing total foreign ownership of US Treasurys to $8.817 trillion as of the end of February. Implications of a foreign exit According to several economists, a sustained reduction in foreign ownership of US Treasurys could create financial hiccups for the federal government. Large-scale sell-offs by foreign governments would push bond prices down and yields up due to the inverse relationship between the two. Higher yields mean the government would need to offer greater returns to attract buyers, which could “force” the US central bank to raise borrowing costs. “Markets are quietly pricing in what Washington won’t admit: systemic decay. The dollar’s decline and surging yields signal eroding global trust and mounting debt pressure. You can’t sustain an empire on vibes and reserve currency status forever. Reality is catching up,” posted one user on X. In fiscal year 2023, the US government spent approximately $881 billion on interest payments alone, a high that surpassed spending on Medicare and the Department of Defense. According to the Treasury Department’s fiscal data website, the interest cost shot up partly because of a rapidly growing national debt, which has exceeded $36 trillion and counting. Record-high interest costs projected The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that interest payments will climb to values as high as $952 billion this fiscal year, accounting for a record 3.2% of gross domestic product (GDP). The CBO also believes interest payments will continue to consume a larger share of economic output. By 2055, interest costs are expected to reach 5.4% of GDP. By the following decade, the average interest rate on US government debt is projected to surpass the country’s economic growth rate, which is a red flag for the long-term fiscal sustainability of the US economy.

At the time of writing, POL (formerly MATIC) was valued at $0.214, up over 16% in the last seven days. In the last 24 hours, the digital currency has increased by almost 9%. These returns have elevated POL into the top ten gainers of the week. The asset has also seen an influx of buying pressure, pushing the market cap to $2.22 billion. POL one-week price and market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap POL’s technical outlook However, the bulls’ strength is needed to offset POL’s current dominant bearish sentiment, which could undermine the sustainability of this run. To this end, the token is trading slightly above its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $0.212, showing modest short-term strength. However, it remains significantly below the 200-day SMA of $0.371187, indicating a persistent long-term downtrend. Meanwhile, on April 22, crypto analyst RLinda noted that POL is in a counter-trend rally within a broader downtrend, approaching a key liquidity zone ($0.228–$0.2438) that may act as resistance.

The expert stressed that despite Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) local gains, the crypto market remains weak, with POL’s movement seen as a liquidity grab before resuming the downtrend. Key resistance levels to watch are $0.2284, $0.2438, and $0.2465, with support at $0.2061 and $0.1929. POL outshines Ethereum in NFT sales Meanwhile, POL’s momentum appears to have been partly influenced by the non-fungible token ( NFT ) sector’s activity. In this case, POL’s NFT market has surged, outpacing Ethereum ( ETH ) for the first time. According to CryptoSlam data , POL recorded $22.1 million in NFT sales in the week ending April 22, edging out Ethereum’s $21.8 million. The network also led in buyer numbers, with 39,027 unique buyers, an 81.61% increase compared to Ethereum’s 36,544. One-week NFT sales per block.

FARTCOIN is now up by 88% in the past fortnight and by 109% in the last 30 days, as whales begin piling into the Solana-based meme coin once again. And given that it remains down by 57% in relation to its ATH of $2.48, it has plenty of scope to continue rising in the near future. This is particularly true if the wider market continues its recent recovery, while Fartcoin itself could also benefit from a Coinbase listing. 88% Up and Still Under the Radar – Is Fartcoin Hiding a Bigger Move? It seems that traders have (re)turned to Fartcoin in order to make some quick profits in what remains an uncertain market, with the token now up by 197% since hitting a one-month low of $0.356 on April 3. It enjoyed a big climb almost a week on from this date, before experiencing another surge over the weekend, led by significant whale purchases .

Its relative strength index (purple) has just passed 70, signalling increased buying pressure, while also warning that the coin is entering an overbought position. At the same time, Fartcoin’s 30-period average (orange) has resumed rising further above the 200-period (blue), another indicator of buying pressure. Source: TradingView But because the shorter term average has been high for a couple of weeks now, it’s possible that FARTCOIN could suffer a selloff later this week. This is what some analysts are beginning to predict, including analysts that had been hyping the token a few weeks ago . Yet the crypto – and meme token – market often defies logic, so it’s also possible that FARTCOIN could continue its rise in the near term. And in the longer term, the approval of altcoin ETFs and an improvement in the global trading situation could help to ignite a new bull market, which would send the token increasingly higher. It could reach $1.50 by the end of May, before entering Q4 at just over $3 – a 200% move from current prices. Alternative Altcoins for Market-Beating Gains Fartcoin is a meme token with limited utility – there always remains a risk that large traders could eventually get bored of it, dooming it to a slow (or quick) death. However, there are newer coins in the market that come with stronger utility and fundamentals, and that therefore arguably have more staying power. One of these is layer-two network Solaxy (SOLX) , a Solana-based coin that has now raised a whopping $31 million in its ongoing presale.

Solaxy will also enable instant bridging itself and Solana, with its network adding compatibility with other chains over time, expanding its reach and potential. Even with recent upgrades, Solana continues to witness delays and dropped transactions, so there’s a space for an L2 such as Solaxy to make entering the Solana ecosystem easier. Its native token SOLX will pay for transaction fees, while holders will also be able to stake it for a passive income. It could therefore attract huge demand, pushing its price up over time. Investors can still join its sale at the Solaxy website , where SOLX is currently available at $0.001702. This price will continue rising until the sale ends, so traders wanting the biggest possible returns should act sooner rather than later.

Bitcoin, the pioneering cryptocurrency, is charting its own course, demonstrating a remarkable resilience that’s capturing the attention of investors worldwide. While the tech-heavy Nasdaq index grapples with a significant year-to-date decline, Bitcoin is not just weathering the storm – it’s showing surprising strength. Let’s delve into the numbers and explore why Bitcoin is currently being hailed for its outperform ance against traditional benchmarks like the Nasdaq. Decoding the BTC/Nasdaq Ratio: Is Bitcoin Truly Outperforming? The BTC/Nasdaq ratio has emerged as a key metric for understanding this evolving dynamic. Think of it as a comparative gauge, measuring Bitcoin’s price movement relative to the Nasdaq. A rising ratio suggests one of two scenarios: either Bitcoin is climbing while Nasdaq stagnates or falls, or Bitcoin is experiencing smaller losses compared to the Nasdaq’s steeper declines. Recently, this ratio has surged to 4.96, inching closer to its January peak of 5.08, as reported by CoinDesk. This elevation isn’t just a statistical anomaly; it signals a tangible shift in market behavior. To put this into perspective, let’s look at the raw numbers: Year-to-Date (YTD) Performance: Bitcoin is down by approximately 6%. While any decline isn’t ideal, consider this against the backdrop of the Nasdaq’s performance. Nasdaq’s Plunge: The Nasdaq, a bellwether for the technology sector and often seen as a proxy for growth stocks, has plummeted by a substantial 15% YTD. This stark contrast immediately highlights Bitcoin’s relative strength. Post-Trump Era Comparison: Zooming out slightly, since November (U.S. President Donald Trump’s election victory), Bitcoin has surged by an impressive 30%. In the same timeframe, the Nasdaq has actually contracted by 12%. This longer-term view further reinforces the narrative of Bitcoin’s distinct trajectory. These figures paint a clear picture: Bitcoin is not just keeping pace with the Nasdaq; it’s demonstrably outperforming it in the current economic climate. But what factors are contributing to this surprising resilience? Why is Bitcoin Showing Crypto Resilience Amidst Market Turmoil? Several factors could be at play, contributing to Bitcoin’s apparent crypto resilience . It’s important to remember that the cryptocurrency market operates under different dynamics compared to traditional equities. Here are a few potential explanations: Decentralization Narrative: Bitcoin’s inherent decentralization is often touted as a key advantage. In times of economic uncertainty or geopolitical instability, investors may perceive decentralized assets as a safer haven compared to traditional systems heavily reliant on central authorities and governmental policies. Inflation Hedge Perception: While the debate continues on whether Bitcoin is a true inflation hedge, the narrative persists. With inflation rates soaring globally, some investors may be turning to Bitcoin as a store of value, anticipating its potential to retain or increase its purchasing power over time, unlike fiat currencies that can be devalued by inflation. Maturing Market Dynamics: The cryptocurrency market, while still volatile, is maturing. Increased institutional adoption, the development of sophisticated trading instruments, and a growing understanding of crypto assets could be contributing to a more robust and less reactive market behavior for Bitcoin. Unique Investor Base: The cryptocurrency investor base is often distinct from traditional stock market participants. A significant portion of crypto investors are driven by long-term conviction in the technology and its potential, rather than short-term market fluctuations. This ‘hodler’ mentality can reduce selling pressure during market downturns, contributing to price stability. CoinDesk’s report also points out that the elevated BTC/Nasdaq ratio suggests Bitcoin is demonstrating greater crypto resilience to broader market downturns. Interestingly, this trend isn’t isolated to Bitcoin alone. Stocks related to the cryptocurrency industry are also exhibiting similar patterns, indicating a sector-wide phenomenon. Navigating the Market Downturn: What Does Bitcoin’s Outperformance Mean for Investors? The current market scenario, characterized by a significant market downturn affecting traditional equities, presents both challenges and opportunities for investors. Bitcoin’s outperform ance of the Nasdaq raises some crucial questions and offers potential insights: Is Bitcoin Becoming a Safe Haven Asset? The traditional safe-haven assets are often gold, government bonds, and certain currencies like the Swiss Franc or Japanese Yen. Bitcoin’s recent performance is prompting discussions about its potential role as a modern, digital safe haven. While it’s premature to definitively label Bitcoin as a safe haven, its demonstrated resilience during market stress is undeniable. Investors looking for diversification and assets that may behave differently from traditional markets might find Bitcoin increasingly appealing. Diversification Benefits: Reducing Portfolio Volatility? One of the core tenets of sound investment strategy is diversification. Bitcoin’s low correlation, and at times negative correlation, with traditional assets like stocks and bonds has long been recognized. In a market downturn where traditional asset classes are moving in tandem downwards, incorporating Bitcoin into a portfolio could potentially mitigate overall volatility and improve risk-adjusted returns. The current situation further underscores this potential diversification benefit. Long-Term Investment Perspective: Ignoring Short-Term Noise? The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Short-term price swings are common, and emotional reactions can lead to impulsive decisions. However, Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory remains compelling for many. Focusing on the fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin, its technological advancements, and its growing adoption can help investors navigate short-term market downturn s with greater confidence. The current outperform ance against the Nasdaq can be viewed as a signal of underlying strength, reinforcing the long-term investment thesis for Bitcoin. Actionable Insights for Investors: Re-evaluate Portfolio Allocation: Consider reviewing your portfolio allocation in light of Bitcoin’s performance. Is your portfolio adequately diversified to weather market volatility? Due Diligence is Key: While Bitcoin shows promise, thorough research and understanding of the risks involved are crucial. Don’t invest blindly; educate yourself about the cryptocurrency market. Long-Term Vision: If you believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, consider viewing market downturns as potential buying opportunities, rather than moments for panic selling. Monitor the BTC/Nasdaq Ratio: Keep an eye on the BTC/Nasdaq ratio as a potential indicator of market sentiment and Bitcoin’s relative strength. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Powerful Resilience in the Face of Market Headwinds The data is clear: Bitcoin is currently outperforming the Nasdaq, demonstrating a remarkable crypto resilience amidst a broader market downturn . While the future remains uncertain and market dynamics can shift rapidly, Bitcoin’s ability to stand strong while traditional markets falter is a significant development. Whether this trend continues remains to be seen, but for now, Bitcoin is sending a powerful message about its evolving role in the global financial landscape. Its demonstrated strength offers a glimmer of hope and a compelling narrative of resilience in an otherwise turbulent economic environment.

43672242,https://nulltx.com/?p=148155,1745335979,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Smart Money Flows Signal Rising Interest in DeFi, Stablecoins, AI, and Meme Narratives",https://nulltx.com/smart-money-flows-signal-rising-interest-in-defi-stablecoins-ai-and-meme-narratives/,"Over the previous 24 hours, income-smart crypto wallets have strategically shifted across several trending narratives in the digital currency space, reflecting a growing investor confidence in sectors like DeFi (decentralized finance, that is, financial services performed without the intermediaries traditional finance relies on), stablecoin utility, AI-driven ecosystems, and the always unpredictable memecoin sector. As on-chain activity heats up, today’s look at smart money accumulation patterns reveals not just early trend recognition but also some tactical positioning from seasoned crypto participants. Blockchain tracking data show that smart money inflows are concentrated in four main narratives: DeFi Innovations, Stablecoins & Payments, Gaming & AI, and MEMEs. Let’s take a closer look at how these categories are being targeted and which tokens seem to be drawing the most attention. DeFi, Stablecoins, and AI Lead Strategic Accumulation One of the most significant trends was DeFi innovation. Five different smart wallets made substantial moves into decentralized finance projects. The standout in this segment was $ALCX (Alchemix), a protocol that now offers self-repaying loans. We believe that’s ultimately a more sustainable payments mechanism in a market that currently favors self-sustaining DeFi offerings. Reintroducing core technology to a broader DeFi audience has been Alchemix’s recent mission. The AlchemixFi team has been hitting the marketing beat like a fresh wave. With the fundamental protocol set to receive some much-mooted updates, it feels like informed investment attention is coming to Alchemix more than ever. Increasingly, people are paying attention to what’s happening with stablecoins, and it seems like there’s some good old-fashioned interest building up and around Aave’s stablecoin, GHO. In the past week, we saw nearly $110,000 stream into the smart contract that lives on Ethereum for GHO, which is a fully collateralized stablecoin. @DeFiEyewitness on Twitter caught this action, highlighting that one wallet in particular has been making quite the show of accumulating GHO. This is an interesting sign for a stablecoin that very few people had heard of even a couple of months ago. Smart money wallets accumulations in the last 24 hours Main specific narratives accumulated: DeFi Innovations (5 wallets) Stablecoins & Payments (3 wallets) Gaming & AI (3 wallets) MEME (3 wallets) Top accumulations and reasoning: $ALCX -> Alchemix is… pic.twitter.com/jR3hecrcZL — CoinSense.app (@CoinSense_App) April 21, 2025 In the meantime, in the AI and gaming narrative, $wTAO (Wrapped TAO) drew in funds from two very intelligent investors, with a combined inflow of around $52,000. wTAO is part of the larger Bittensor ecosystem. It’s getting a lot of attention lately due to its work in decentralized AI and the staking opportunities that @TensorplexLabs has been promoting. Meanwhile, AI continues to be the darling of tech discussions the world over, and blockchain-solutions for AI seem to be getting a lot of speculative love. Memecoin Craze Continues with $RIP POPE The memecoin sector won’t be sidelined, even as more structured narratives grow. One narrative really took off over the past 24 hours, and that was around $RIP POPE, a satirical token that seems to be part of a developing trend of altcoins based on narratives around Pope Francis. Those in the know about crypto Twitter may have noticed a few accounts portraying the pope as an important figure in the ongoing drama that is the fate of the crypto space. Three smart money wallets made trades involving $RIP POPE, resulting in a net influx of $30,000. While that may seem modest compared to other DeFi or stablecoin plays, it’s a notable amount for a meme asset that thrives on narrative and virality. Part of the reason the token has attracted so much attention lately is because of its dark humor and edgy branding. This is a winning combination, time and again, for drawing in speculative interest around a potentially viral memecoin. For the truly interested, these early wallet entries may hint at the next big thing you can ride to viral retail exposure. Broader Narrative Implications and Market Sentiment When viewed collectively, the recent actions of smart money shed light on the evolving crypto structure. There’s a clear appearance of balanced positioning across high-risk meme assets, long-duration AI plays, stablecoin integrations, and DeFi use cases. Each of these narratives offers a different risk-reward profile, and the accumulation of across-the-board exposure is a clear signal of sophisticated investor engagement. The renewed focus on stablecoins and decentralized lending could indicate the need to be cautious or, rather, to pivot toward generating yield and preserving capital. At the same time, when funds make big bets on tokens like wTAO, it’s hard not to see that as a reflection of speculative interest in what many believe will be the next big thing: AI on the blockchain. And of course, the meme market remains the wild card—an area where timing, sentiment, and social media hype can quickly turn small positions into outsized returns. With smart money now dipping its toes in both ends of the risk spectrum, the next few weeks could rapidly shift market focus. Like always, these movements of capital in and out of wallets do not guarantee future price movements. But they do offer a good view of the informed capital that’s flowing into and out of the relevant narratives. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $89,867 before climbing to $90,743, marking a 3.84% increase on the day. This decoupling is highlighted by Bitcoin's performance against a backdrop of declining Nasdaq indices and a weakening U.S. dollar. Analysts suggest that this movement indicates Bitcoin is beginning to trade more like gold, a traditional safe-haven asset, rather than following the trends of tech stocks.

Its impressive price increase was likely triggered by backing from Binance and Upbit. Reacting to the News Although most of the cryptocurrency market has turned green on a daily scale, one low-cap altcoin has stolen the show. DeepBook (DEEP) is not among the top 100 club, but has outperformed almost all assets from that list in the past 24 hours. Earlier today (April 22), its price was trading at around $0.09. Just an hour later, though, it jumped to a seven-week high of $0.16. DEEP’s peak was short-lived, and it later retraced to the current $0.11, which represents a 22% ascent for the day. DEEP Price, Source: CoinGecko The rally was likely fueled by the support from the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange as Binance Futures launched the DEEP/USDT perpetual contract with up to 50x leverage. The product has no expiration date and allows traders to bet on the price of the cryptocurrency without actually owning it. The exchange clarified that futures and spot token listings are not correlated. This means that a cryptocurrency listed on Binance Futures does not guarantee that it will be added to Binance Spot. Upbit, which listed the DEEP/KRW trading pair earlier today, may have also contributed to the asset’s price increase . Thus, South Korea’s leading crypto exchange doubled down on its backing for the token since it previously introduced the DEEP/BTC and DEEP/KRW pairs. Examples in the Past Support from major exchanges like the aforementioned ones increases the liquidity of the involved cryptocurrencies, enhances their visibility and availability, and gives them a reputational boost. Earlier this month, Binance placed the meme coin Cat in a Dogs World (MEW) in its Binance Alpha section – a platform within the exchange’s ecosystem that serves as a pre-listing selection pool. The token’s price rallied by 15% shortly after the inclusion . In February, Upbit introduced the trading pairs TRUMP/KRW, TRUMP/BTC, and TRUMP/USDT. The meme coin launched by US President Donald Trump pumped by 10% following the announcement .

Deribit, the leading exchange for Bitcoin options, meanwhile, saw open interest spike by an astonishing 24% in just one day, with total outstanding contracts skyrocketing to $1.85 billion. Call options, which give the holder the right but not the obligation to buy an asset at a set price before a certain time, represent the biggest chunk at $1.12 billion. Simultaneously, major institutional influencers such as MetaPlanet and MicroStrategy are amassing Bitcoin, demonstrating deep faith in the asset’s sustained worth. Conversely, a number of retail traders are set up for a move to the downside, suggesting a stark divergence in market sentiment. With this potent combination of leverage, accumulation, and uncertainty, Bitcoin is once more dancing on the edge of the $90,000 precipice. Leverage Spikes and Bearish Sentiment on Binance The $3.2 billion increase in open interest means more and more people are active in the crypto derivatives market. Speculation is the lifeblood of any financial market, but especially so when the crypto market is trending as it’s quite common for traders to dream of hitting the jackpot. We are living in the times of a tumultuous crypto market where prices are very indecisive and take big swings to one side or another. 59.79% of traders on Binance with open #Bitcoin $BTC positions are betting on downside! pic.twitter.com/MQDBWwtibm — Ali (@ali_charts) April 21, 2025 Almost 60% of positions held by traders on Binance for Bitcoin are currently bearish. These traders are betting that the price of Bitcoin is going to fall. This concentration of bearish sentiment is a pretty good setup for a potential short squeeze. If the price of Bitcoin were to start skyrocket, these traders shorting the asset might be forced to close their positions. Concurrently, approximately $155 million in profit has been returned to the whales, a clear signal that some major stakeholders are seizing this current upward movement to cash in. Of course, it’s normal market behavior during an uptrend for traders and investors to book profits when the price is up, and those actions obviously have the potential to reverse the uptrend. Whales have recently realized close to $155 million in profits from #Bitcoin $BTC ! pic.twitter.com/okrM2oeUMk — Ali (@ali_charts) April 21, 2025 MetaPlanet and MicroStrategy Double Down on Bitcoin Holdings Quieting the short-term noise, institutions remain long-term and very positive on Bitcoin. Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has acquired an additional 330 BTC worth some $28.23 million at an average price of $86,637. This pushes their total holdings to 4,855 BTC worth around $425.37 million. They hold an average price around $91,030. So, they’re slightly underwater on this, but clearly committed. MetaPlanet( @Metaplanet_JP ) bought another 330 $BTC ($28.23M) at $86,637. MetaPlanet currently holds 4,855 $BTC ($425.37M), with an average buying price of $91,030. https://t.co/LRlXDOEoNK pic.twitter.com/yjjZUCBhNr — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 21, 2025 At the same time, MicroStrategy has been making news for yet another huge buy. The outfit bought 6,556 BTC for about $555.85 million, at an average price of $84,785. Their total count of BTC now sits at 538,200, with a notional valuation of close to $46.83 billion. With an average purchase price of $67,766, MicroStrategy holds an unrealized profit of over $10 billion. These recurring acquisitions demonstrate that, for major institutional investors, Bitcoin remains a core reserve asset and a hedge against the sorts of mainstream finance risks that every financial model seems prone to these days. MicroStrategy( @Strategy ) bought another 6,556 $BTC ($555.85M) at an average price of $84,785 last week. #Strategy currently holds 538,200 $BTC ($46.83B), with an average buying price of $67,766 and an unrealized profit of $10.36B. https://t.co/oiJUFQMH9g pic.twitter.com/PA73kWGIUu — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 21, 2025 Spot ETF Flows Remain Positive Amid Broader Market Uncertainty Bolstering the institutional optimism is the ongoing influx of capital into Bitcoin spot ETFs. During the timeframe of April 14 to April 17, the total net inflow into spot Bitcoin ETFs reached $15.85 million. While this is modest next to some of the earlier record-setting weeks in terms of inflows, it nonetheless serves as a clear indicator of the continued and steady demand from traditional investors for more regulated financial products that provide direct exposure to Bitcoin. Last week (April 14 to April 17, Eastern Time), the Ethereum spot ETF had a net outflow of $32.17 million, marking eight consecutive weeks of net outflows. The Bitcoin spot ETF had a net inflow of $15.85 million in a single week. https://t.co/Tvs2oCSxTg — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 21, 2025 This trend indicates that Bitcoin is slowly being assimilated into larger investment portfolios, and the persistent enthusiasm from ETF purchasers is probably going to furnish continuous support for the price. A Market at a Crossroads The Bitcoin market today is a very sharp divide between retail pessimism and institutional optimism. There is a lot of leverage, a lot of shorts, and yet institutions continue to accumulate at an impressive rate. The current market is a tug-of-war between short-term profit-taking and long-term conviction, and it feels like it is reaching a climax. It remains to be seen whether Bitcoin will decisively push past the $90,000 level or whether it will experience a temporary correction. What is clear, though, is that Bitcoin is evolving into something that is both a speculative asset and a strategic store of value. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Unlike traditional staking services, Rocket Pool allows users to pool their Ethereum (ETH) to run validator nodes on the Ethereum network. Thus, participants can participate in the staking process without requiring the full 32 ETH to run a validator node. Furthermore, Rocket Pool introduces the concept of “rETH” tokens, which are issued to users who stake ETH in the Rocket Pool network. These rETH tokens represent users’ stake in the pool and can be traded or transferred independently of the underlying ETH, providing liquidity and flexibility to participants. Overall, Rocket Pool aims to democratize Ethereum staking and contribute to the decentralization of the Ethereum network by providing a secure, efficient, and accessible platform for staking participation. As DeFi continues to gain traction, Rocket Pool stands out as a pioneering project at the forefront of innovation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. What can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? Can Rocket Pool’s price reach $50?

The RSI stands at 46.69, nearing the neutral 50 level, which indicates improving but still cautious momentum. Price action is still below the 20-day simple moving average, suggesting the broader bearish sentiment has not fully reversed. For sustained upside, a clear break above $4.27 is essential. Failing that, the price may consolidate within the $3.78 to $4.27 range. Traders should watch volume and momentum indicators for confirmation of any breakout. RPL/USD 4-hour price chart analysis RPL/USD 4-hour price chart, Source: TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart for Rocket Pool (RPL), the token recently attempted a breakout but met resistance around the $4.37 level, coinciding with the upper Bollinger Band. The price has since retraced and is now hovering near the midline of the Bollinger Bands. The MACD shows declining bullish momentum, with the histogram narrowing and the signal line converging toward a potential bearish crossover. The Balance of Power indicator registers -1.00, suggesting sellers currently dominate the market. Unless buyers regain control and push above $4.37, RPL may continue to consolidate or decline toward support at $3.92 or lower.

Based on both the 4-hour and 1-day charts, Rocket Pool (RPL) is navigating a cautious recovery within a broader downtrend. On the 1-day chart, RPL is facing resistance at the 20-day SMA around $4.27, while the RSI at 46.69 indicates weak momentum, just below neutral territory. The 4-hour chart supports this hesitation, with a recent pullback after failing to sustain gains above $4.37. MACD is flattening, suggesting fading bullish energy, and the Balance of Power shows persistent selling pressure. For a sustained rally, RPL must reclaim and hold above $4.27. Otherwise, consolidation or a drop back toward $3.78 remains likely. Is Rocket Pool a good investment? Rocket Pool (RPL) presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its innovative decentralized Ethereum staking model, offering potentially high returns through staking rewards. However, investors should consider market volatility and competition within the DeFi space. Conduct thorough research and assess personal risk tolerance before investing in RPL.

This development, reported by Seoul Economic Daily, signals a heightened focus on compliance and operational integrity within the nation’s burgeoning crypto sector. But what exactly does this mean for Coinone, the broader South Korean crypto market, and you as a crypto enthusiast? Why is South Korea Crypto Regulation Focusing on Coinone? The FIU’s inspection is not arbitrary; it’s a direct consequence of Coinone’s application for renewal as a virtual asset service provider (VASP), submitted in October 2024. Under the stringent guidelines of South Korea’s financial transaction reporting law, every crypto exchange operating in the country must register as a VASP and adhere to rigorous anti-money laundering (AML) protocols. This inspection serves as a critical checkpoint in Coinone’s renewal process, ensuring they meet the necessary standards to continue serving the South Korean crypto market. South Korea has emerged as a key player in the global cryptocurrency space, with a vibrant trading community and a proactive regulatory approach. The government’s stance is clear: foster innovation while safeguarding the financial system and protecting users from illicit activities. This inspection of Coinone underscores this dual objective – promoting a compliant and secure crypto ecosystem. Focus on AML Compliance Crypto: The Core of the Inspection At the heart of the FIU’s on-site visit is an in-depth assessment of Coinone’s AML compliance crypto framework. Anti-money laundering measures are crucial in the crypto world to prevent digital assets from being used to finance illegal activities, including terrorism, drug trafficking, and other financial crimes. The FIU wants to ascertain whether Coinone has robust systems and procedures in place to: Customer Due Diligence (CDD): Verify the identity of their customers and understand the nature of their transactions. This involves Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. Transaction Monitoring: Scrutinize transactions for suspicious patterns that might indicate money laundering or terrorist financing. Reporting Suspicious Activity: File Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) with the FIU when they detect unusual or potentially illicit transactions. Record Keeping: Maintain comprehensive records of transactions and customer data for audit trails and regulatory oversight. Failure to meet these AML compliance crypto obligations can result in significant penalties, including fines, operational restrictions, or even the revocation of VASP registration. For Coinone, demonstrating a strong commitment to AML is not just about regulatory adherence; it’s about maintaining trust and credibility within the competitive South Korean crypto exchange landscape. Coinone Inspection and the Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) Renewal Process The virtual asset service provider (VASP) registration and renewal process in South Korea is a rigorous undertaking designed to ensure only compliant and secure platforms operate within the country. Coinone, like other exchanges, must navigate this process to maintain its operational license. The key stages typically involve: Application Submission: Exchanges must submit a detailed application to the FIU, providing comprehensive information about their business operations, security protocols, AML measures, and management structure. On-Site Inspection: As seen with Coinone, the FIU conducts on-site inspections to verify the information provided in the application and assess the exchange’s actual operational practices. Review and Evaluation: The FIU thoroughly reviews the application and inspection findings to determine if the exchange meets the VASP requirements. Approval or Rejection: Based on the evaluation, the FIU grants or denies the VASP registration or renewal. Approval allows the exchange to continue operating legally in South Korea, while rejection necessitates operational changes or potential closure. For Coinone, successfully navigating this virtual asset service provider (VASP) renewal is paramount. A positive outcome not only ensures continued operation but also reinforces its standing as a reliable and compliant exchange in the eyes of users and the broader market. What are the Potential Implications of the Coinone Inspection? The Coinone inspection by the FIU carries several potential implications for various stakeholders: For Coinone: The immediate impact is focused on demonstrating robust AML compliance and operational integrity to secure VASP renewal. A successful inspection will reaffirm their regulatory standing and market position. For the South Korean Crypto Market: This inspection sets a precedent and reinforces the FIU’s commitment to stringent oversight. It signals to other exchanges that AML compliance is non-negotiable and encourages proactive measures to meet regulatory expectations. For Crypto Users: Enhanced regulatory scrutiny ultimately aims to create a safer and more trustworthy crypto trading environment. Users can have greater confidence that exchanges are operating under strict guidelines designed to protect their interests and prevent illicit activities. Broader Regulatory Trends: South Korea’s proactive approach to crypto regulation serves as a benchmark for other jurisdictions grappling with the challenges of overseeing the digital asset space. The outcomes of inspections like Coinone’s can influence global regulatory trends and best practices. South Korea Crypto Regulation: A Global Benchmark? South Korea crypto regulation has often been viewed as forward-thinking and comprehensive. The country was among the first to establish a clear legal framework for virtual assets, including the VASP registration system. This proactive stance has positioned South Korea as a leader in responsible crypto regulation. Key aspects of South Korea crypto regulation that stand out include: Clear VASP Framework: The establishment of a VASP registration system provides clarity and legitimacy to crypto exchanges operating in the country. Emphasis on AML: Strong focus on anti-money laundering measures to combat financial crime in the crypto space. Consumer Protection: Regulations are designed to protect users from fraud, market manipulation, and other risks associated with crypto trading. Innovation-Friendly Approach: While stringent, the regulatory framework aims to strike a balance between oversight and fostering innovation in the blockchain and crypto sector. As the global crypto landscape continues to evolve, the effectiveness of South Korea crypto regulation will be closely watched by other nations seeking to establish their own regulatory frameworks. Key Takeaways from the Coinone Inspection The Coinone inspection serves as a crucial reminder of the evolving regulatory landscape in the cryptocurrency world. Here are some actionable insights: Compliance is King: For crypto exchanges, robust AML compliance is not optional; it’s a fundamental requirement for sustainable operation and regulatory approval. Regulatory Scrutiny is Increasing: Expect continued and potentially intensified regulatory scrutiny on crypto exchanges globally as authorities seek to manage risks and protect consumers. Transparency and Security are Paramount: Exchanges must prioritize transparency in their operations and implement robust security measures to build trust and meet regulatory expectations. Stay Informed: Crypto users and investors should stay informed about regulatory developments in their jurisdictions and choose exchanges that demonstrate a commitment to compliance and security. Conclusion: Navigating the Evolving Crypto Regulatory Landscape The FIU’s on-site inspection of Coinone is more than just a routine check; it’s a powerful signal of the increasing maturity and regulatory focus within the South Korean crypto market. As the industry continues to grow and gain mainstream adoption, expect to see even greater emphasis on compliance, security, and consumer protection. For exchanges like Coinone, navigating this evolving landscape successfully is essential for long-term viability and success. And for crypto enthusiasts, understanding these regulatory developments is key to participating in a safer and more sustainable digital asset ecosystem.

This means all payments, bets, payouts, and other actions can be automated, not relying on a third party or agent. The payment is also entirely in crypto or one of the thousands of tokens supported by the Ethereum network. This allows casino enthusiasts with a crypto wallet to join, with minimal geographic restrictions. Ethereum is a preferred choice for casinos due to its accessibility. ETH can be easily swapped or purchased through various apps and brokerages and sent to a user-controlled wallet. Ethereum casinos cater to all kinds of players, from high-stakes bettors to casual gamers, offering a range of experiences similar to traditional gambling platforms. While fiat casinos benefit from being more established, the advent of Ethereum and cryptocurrency gambling has introduced confidential betting and instant withdrawals, attracting a growing audience to Ethereum-based platforms. Ethereum casinos operate on varied licenses, including offshore registration. Some operate without a license, based on their crypto status, while others are compliant with national crypto regulations, restricting access to some regions. What is an Ethereum casino? An Ethereum casino is an online gambling platform that utilizes Ethereum blockchain technology to enable secure, transparent, and instant transactions. These platforms offer a variety of games that typically use ETH as a primary payment method but may also support other compatible tokens. Many Ethereum casinos incorporate USDT, a stablecoin pegged to the dollar, to make transactions more straightforward and intuitive. In terms of gameplay, Ethereum casinos mirror traditional online gaming sites, offering slot games, card games, roulette, and even live peer-to-peer (P2P) casino experiences. One of the key advantages of Ethereum casinos is the added layer of security and privacy. Players can participate without exposing their banking information or personal identity. Depending on local regulations, some Ethereum casinos may not require identity verification. These no-KYC (Know Your Customer) platforms process payments exclusively through anonymous smart contracts, ensuring a seamless and private gambling experience. How to find the best Ethereum casinos Looking for the best Ethereum casino out there and safe ways to participate? Here are some tips for you: Research the platform : Confirm that the Ethereum casino has a visible online presence, active traffic, and legitimate user reviews. You should also verify that payouts and results are vetted by trusted sources. Use official links only : Always access your preferred platform through official links, not through links shared in chats or randomly on social media, to ensure you are not visiting a copycat site . Have a dedicated new wallet for playing, which will connect to the casino’s smart contracts to make bets or take payouts. Only connect a wallet after you are sure it is the right link. Avoid holding major assets in the Ethereum wallet set up for gaming or gambling. List of top Ethereum casinos 1. BC.Game Source: BG.Game BC.Game is an Ethereum casino with a Web3 element.

Many platforms also support privacy coins like DASH and ZEC, as well as fiat deposits for greater flexibility. To make a deposit: Select the appropriate network for transferring funds. Casinos like Cloudbet offer multiple network options for depositing USDT, such as BNB Smart Chain, TON, and TRON. Ensure you send USDT to the correct network, as using the wrong one may result in a loss of funds. 4. Start playing Once your deposit is confirmed, the games launch immediately, allowing you to begin betting seamlessly. 5. Top up during gameplay If your balance runs low, the casino will prompt you to deposit more funds without interrupting your game. What are the risks of Ethereum casinos? Most Ethereum casinos are highly secure, but they can often fall prey to scams. Potential risks include: Malicious social media links from a spoof account. Fake casino sites, which drain assets from a wallet. General exploits of the casino’s wallets, which affect user funds. When interacting with an Ethereum casino, do not visit the site through links shared on chats or social media. Verify the official link through Trustpilot. Risk to personal Ethereum wallets is also present, with attackers creating fake deposit addresses. Always use the official deposit links, and never copy links from a wallet’s history. Use a wallet dedicated to Ethereum casinos, with limited funds to avoid the theft of all assets.","Deep Dive - Crypto, Web3 & Market Insights|BC.GAME|BetPanda|BetPlay|Bets.IO|Cloudbet|CoinPoker|Ethereum|Instant Casino|Lucky Block|TG Casino",EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|FIAT|USDT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-22 15:45:22

MİCA Call Arrived!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/trumps-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-moves-caused-the-european-central-bank-to-panic-mica-call-arrived/,"The United States has been taking a lukewarm approach towards Bitcoin (BTC) and the cryptocurrency sector with Donald Trump as its president. The support given to cryptocurrencies by the US under the Trump administration has spurred the European Central Bank (ECB) into action. According to Politico, the ECB warned that Trump and the US's support for cryptocurrencies could pose financial risks to Europe and called for changes to MiCA rules. The ECB is concerned that US reforms backed by Trump could flood European markets with dollar-denominated stablecoins, which the ECB fears could lead to a flight of European capital into US assets, undermining the EU’s financial sovereignty and exposing banks to liquidity risks. While MiCA limits the issuance of foreign-backed stablecoins, the ECB is troubled by two new draft laws – STABLE and GENIUS – that aim to expand the reach of largely dollar-backed stablecoins in the US, and therefore fears that it may not be strong enough to combat the effects of MiCA. While the ECB is concerned about the economic risks to the European Union, the European Commission has dismissed the warnings as exaggerated and the concerns as being overblown, saying current regulations are sufficient. *This is not investment advice.

In a major development, the company has signed agreements with Crypto.com and Yorkville America Digital to introduce a suite of exchange-traded products—including ETFs linked to Bitcoin and the Cronos token. Expanding into Fintech with Truth.Fi The move marks a strategic expansion for TMTG, which earlier this year launched its fintech division, Truth.Fi. The new entity aims to invest up to $250 million in ETFs and separately managed accounts (SMAs), targeting sectors such as digital assets and core American industries like energy. “This agreement is a major step forward in diversifying TMTG into financial services and digital assets,” said CEO and Chairman Devin Nunes. He added that the company’s goal is to create investment products “for investors who believe both the American economy and digital assets are poised for tremendous growth.” Global Ambitions and Regulatory Pathways The ETFs, once they receive the necessary regulatory approvals, are set to roll out later this year across North America, Europe, and Asia via existing brokerages and platforms. Foris Capital US LLC, Crypto.com’s registered broker-dealer, will handle distribution. These developments come after Trump Media revealed a non-binding agreement with Crypto.com in March. In addition to ETFs, the company plans to introduce Truth.Fi-branded SMAs, although further details are still under wraps. Crypto.com’s Role in Bridging TradFi and Crypto Crypto.com’s involvement is key to the project’s execution and credibility. CEO Kris Marszalek called the partnership “a testament” to the platform’s ability to connect traditional finance with the crypto world. “It’s a win for Trump Media, Crypto.com, CRO, and Yorkville America Digital,” Marszalek stated, signaling confidence in the upcoming product lineup and its global distribution potential. Troy Rillo, CEO of Yorkville America Digital, added, “Finalizing our agreement with Trump Media and Crypto.com for our ETF launch is a significant milestone as we work to bring to market new products that align with the America-First focus of our firm.” Future Roadmap: Cronos ETF and Stablecoin Looking ahead, Crypto.com has ambitious plans for the remainder of 2025. A spot ETF for Cronos (CRO) is scheduled for application submission in Q4 2025. In parallel, the company is also preparing to launch a stablecoin by Q3. While full details are still unknown, the stablecoin is expected to improve cross-border payments, DeFi usage, and on-platform transactions. Additionally, brokerage giant Charles Schwab has been appointed custodian for the $250 million fund set aside by Trump Media, further reinforcing institutional backing behind the effort. With this partnership, Trump Media is positioning itself at the intersection of conservative finance and crypto innovation—an area likely to attract both political and investor interest in equal measure.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|CRO,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-04-22 15:46:15

The yen rose by as much as 0.7% to 139.90 per dollar. This occurred after uncertainty grew over the Federal Reserve’s independence, rising concerns about tariffs, and news of a planned meeting between Japan’s and America’s finance chiefs. At 139.90, the yen was at its strongest point since last September, according to a Bloomberg report . On Tuesday, it outperformed all other Group-of-10 currencies. Demand for the yen has soared this month, thanks in part to President Donald Trump’s trade war with other nations. The yen gained nearly 7% against the dollar in April alone as investors sought refuge from the fallout. Unease also rose when Trump signaled he might remove Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The president is preparing to blame the Fed if it does not cut rates soon to offset the trade war’s economic impact. Analysts at Mizuho Securities noted that falling U.S. stock prices and upcoming talks could push the yen toward its 2024 high of 139.58. They said that if investors test that level, it could spur even more buying. “If the yen clearly exceeds the 140 level or the mid‑139 level that it hit in September last year, it’ll become easier for technical factors to trigger yen buying and dollar selling, accelerating the yen’s appreciation,” said Hideki Shibata, senior fixed‑income and foreign‑exchange strategist at Tokai Tokyo Intelligence Laboratory Co. Traders’ Yen bets hit record high before Japan-US meeting Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed speculative traders held the most bullish positions on the yen ever recorded as of April 15. All eyes are now on the meeting reportedly set for this week between Japan’s Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Trump has publicly accused Japan of keeping its currency weak to help its exports, and Kato has said he will press for in‑depth talks on currency moves. Bloomberg strategists pointed out that while USD/JPY briefly dipped below 140, it has yet to fall much further. They added that a broader “sell America” mood could keep pushing the yen higher in the weeks ahead. The Bank of Japan officials see little reason to alter their plan for a gradual rise in rates despite U.S. tariff uncertainty. Still, overnight index swaps now price in a 59% chance of a BOJ rate hike by year’s end, down from near certainty before recent U.S. tariff announcements.

43672787,https://nulltx.com/?p=148153,1745337027,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Whales Ramp Up Ethereum Accumulation Amid Prolonged ETF Outflows,https://nulltx.com/whales-ramp-up-ethereum-accumulation-amid-prolonged-etf-outflows/,"Even though Ethereum spot ETFs have been experiencing net outflows, on-chain activity tells a different story. Ethereum “whales”—that is, investors and entities who hold large amounts of the cryptocurrency—are making brisk purchases of the asset. They are withdrawing millions of dollars’ worth of Ethereum from centralized exchanges and are moving it to decentralized platforms, including lending protocols like Aave. This large-scale movement by the whales suggests a growing, or at least a continuing, confidence in the long-term value of Ethereum. Although many use ETF flows as a proxy for gauging institutional interest, the data from the blockchain provide a more sophisticated picture. That shows not just intelligence but also the smart kind where what we used to call dumb money—non-institutional investors—is even more active than we thought. Yet, inexplicably, in the midst of all this buying by both smart crypto funds and not-so-smart non-institutional investors, the price of ETH remains somewhat consolidated. It appears to be biding its time. In this flow counterpoint, intelligence gathering is job one in both the ETF proxy world and on the blockchain. Exchange Outflows Signal Bullish Whale Behavior In the past 10 hours, a whale withdrew from Bitget 1,897 ETH—about $3 million. This distinct accumulation trend started in early April. If we consider this particular wallet, from which the whale has withdrawn the funds, it has taken out a total of 3,844 ETH since April 3. That’s about $6.51 million. These sustained outflows from the wallet suggest two things: bullish sentiment and a likely return of the funds to the DeFi sector. Here’s why. Whales continue to accumulate $ETH ! A whale withdrew another 1,897 $ETH ($3M) from #Bitget 10 hours ago. This whale has withdrawn 3,844 $ETH ($6.51M) from #Bitget since April 3. https://t.co/HZN9KLPt6M pic.twitter.com/0HCPswZx8w — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 21, 2025 Even more remarkable is the effort from Abraxas Capital, a firm that has been accumulating Ethereum with a lot of enthusiasm. Just two hours ago, Abraxas pulled 6,000 ETH (about $9.88 million) out of Binance and deposited it into Aave, a top-notch decentralized lending platform. This move shows Abraxas is trying to earn some yield on its Ethereum holdings, likely by either supplying liquidity to a decentralized cash marketplace or using some other lending strategy. In the last week, 8,719 ETH have been taken from Binance by Abraxas Capital. The total value of the withdrawals is $14.22 million. What’s interesting here is the confidence that these guys obviously have in the future of Ethereum. They seem very ready to set assets into long-term positions.

On April 14 and April 17, spot ETH ETFs had net outflows of $32.17 million. This marks the eighth consecutive week of net capital exiting Ethereum-related exchange-traded products. Last week (April 14 to April 17, Eastern Time), the Ethereum spot ETF had a net outflow of $32.17 million, marking eight consecutive weeks of net outflows. The Bitcoin spot ETF had a net inflow of $15.85 million in a single week. https://t.co/Tvs2oCSxTg — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 21, 2025 ETF outflows could be due to a mix of macroeconomic uncertainty, regulatory ambiguity over Ethereum’s security status in the U.S., and risk-off sentiment in the traditional finance sector. That said, it’s important to stress that these products are still quite new—and still very much in the experimental stages of their development—as investment vehicles. They may not yet fully reflect the deep conviction levels of investors and firms that are native to the crypto space. There is something particularly intriguing about the gap between traditional finance’s hesitance and the crypto ecosystem’s strong assurance. When ETFs suffer from outflows for week after week, whales and institutional-grade entities—like Abraxas Capital, which in the last week of October 2023 moved to accumulate ETH at even more of a clip than they had previously—are doing the exact opposite reach for crypto tokens. This gap probably reveals something of substance, if not significance. And perhaps what it reveals is not just differing investment horizons—ETFs being more liquid and obviously responsive to short-term market cycles, on-chain accumulation being far less visible and probably far less liquid and hence responsive to anything a normal decentralized finance enthusiast would call an investment horizon—that’s quite the disconnect if you envisage the two types of accumulation happening as part of the same market. Ethereum’s Long-Term Prospects Remain Intact Whales accumulating ETH Large accumulation trend by whales What We’re Seeing: Accumulating whale wallets suggest many large holders are preparing for a future where Ethereum plays a foundational role in the digital economy. Why It’s Important: The current accumulation trend by large holders indicates a potential future movement or use of Ethereum that could have significant implications for its value and role in the digital economy. Although the market might be considering the latest outflows from ETFs as a sign of bearish intent, the actions of these big fish in the crypto sea tell a different story—one in which the sophisticated investors among us are using recent price dips and the slightly sour market mood to get themselves into positions that will pay off the next time we see a big upward move in prices. The Ethereum development team is working on upgrades, including proto-danksharding, that promise to make the network more efficient. Meanwhile, institutions are starting to make meaningful use of Ethereum and its network. If these kinds of usage keep up and grow, accumulated whale investment promises to pay off in a bull run—again, you seem to have my address if this doesn’t happen by the end of the year. I can’t imagine the next five seconds without whale-led capitalization. Meanwhile, on-chain watchers will be observing intently to determine if this accumulation persists and whether ETF sentiment will ultimately align with what seems to be a very strong conviction held by the Ethereum-savvy elite.

After a tumultuous period marked by a massive $234 million hack in July 2024, and subsequent operational challenges, there’s a glimmer of hope on the horizon. Could WazirX be on the verge of a triumphant relaunch ? Let’s delve into the latest developments. Will Singapore Court Ruling Pave the Way for WazirX Relaunch? The fate of WazirX’s operational resumption hinges on a crucial decision from the Singapore High Court. The parent company, Zettai PTE Ltd, has announced that if the court approves their restructuring and compensation plan on May 13, WazirX could potentially resume operations within just ten business days. This update, shared via X on April 21, has injected a renewed sense of optimism among users and industry observers alike. But what exactly is at stake with this Singapore court ruling? Here’s a breakdown: Restructuring Plan: WazirX has submitted a detailed restructuring plan to the Singapore High Court. This plan likely outlines changes to their operational structure, security protocols, and user management systems aimed at preventing future incidents like the devastating hack. Compensation Plan: Crucially, the court will also review WazirX’s proposed compensation plan for users affected by the hack. The details of this plan are eagerly awaited by the community, as it will determine how and to what extent users will be reimbursed for their losses. May 13 Deadline: All eyes are now fixed on May 13. This is the date when the Singapore High Court is expected to deliver its verdict. A positive ruling would clear a significant hurdle for WazirX’s relaunch ambitions. The Singapore court ruling is not just about WazirX; it sets a precedent for how international legal frameworks interact with cryptocurrency exchanges operating across borders. A favorable outcome could boost confidence in the regulatory environment for digital assets, while an unfavorable one could raise further questions about the security and legal liabilities in the crypto space. Navigating the Aftermath of the Crypto Hack: Challenges and Recovery The $234 million crypto hack in July 2024 was a watershed moment for WazirX, and indeed for the entire Indian crypto ecosystem. Such a significant security breach not only causes direct financial losses but also erodes user trust, which is paramount for any financial platform, especially a crypto exchange . The challenges WazirX has faced since the hack are manifold: Security Overhaul: In the wake of the hack, WazirX has undoubtedly had to invest heavily in upgrading its security infrastructure. This likely includes enhanced cybersecurity measures, multi-factor authentication protocols, and perhaps even a complete revamp of their cold storage and hot wallet strategies. Regulatory Scrutiny: Large-scale crypto hacks often attract intense regulatory scrutiny. While the article mentions a petition dismissal in India’s Supreme Court, the incident likely triggered investigations and heightened oversight from regulatory bodies in jurisdictions where WazirX operates or has a user base. User Trust Restoration: Perhaps the biggest challenge is regaining the trust of users. The hack would have shaken confidence, and WazirX needs to demonstrate convincingly that it has taken all necessary steps to prevent future incidents and protect user funds. The compensation plan is a critical component of this trust-building exercise. Despite these challenges, the fact that WazirX is even contemplating a relaunch is a testament to its resilience and determination. The crypto market is known for its volatility, but also for its capacity for rapid recovery and innovation. WazirX’s potential rebound could serve as an inspiring example for other crypto platforms facing adversity. Supreme Court Dismissal: What it Means for WazirX and Users The article mentions that India’s Supreme Court dismissed a related petition from hack victims. What does this dismissal signify in the larger context of WazirX’s resume operations plan? While details of the petition are not provided, the dismissal by the Supreme Court could be interpreted in a few ways: Legal Setback for Petitioners: For the hack victims who filed the petition, the dismissal is undoubtedly a setback. It suggests that the Indian legal route for seeking redress might be closed, or at least face significant hurdles. Focus Shifts to Singapore: The Supreme Court dismissal might indirectly strengthen the importance of the Singapore court proceedings. With the Indian legal avenue seemingly less viable, the Singapore ruling becomes even more crucial for both WazirX and its affected users. Potential for Alternative Redress: It’s important to note that the dismissal of a petition doesn’t necessarily mean victims are left without any recourse. They might still have avenues for seeking compensation through the Singapore court process, particularly if the restructuring and compensation plan is deemed inadequate or unfair. The interplay between legal jurisdictions in cases involving international crypto exchange operations is complex. The Supreme Court dismissal highlights the multi-layered legal landscape that crypto businesses and users must navigate. Actionable Insights: What Should WazirX Users and Crypto Enthusiasts Watch For? For those closely following the WazirX situation, here are some actionable insights and key developments to monitor: May 13 Singapore Court Ruling: Mark your calendars! This is the most critical upcoming event. The court’s decision will directly impact WazirX’s relaunch timeline and the compensation prospects for affected users. Details of the Compensation Plan: Keep an eye out for the specifics of WazirX’s compensation plan. Understanding the terms and conditions, eligibility criteria, and payout timelines is essential for users who suffered losses in the hack. WazirX Communications: Monitor WazirX’s official communication channels, including their X account and website, for updates following the court ruling. Pay attention to announcements regarding operational resumption, security enhancements, and user support protocols. Regulatory Responses: Observe how regulatory bodies in India and Singapore, and potentially other relevant jurisdictions, respond to the Singapore court ruling and WazirX’s relaunch efforts. Regulatory signals can provide insights into the long-term viability and operating environment for WazirX. The WazirX saga is a compelling case study in the volatile yet dynamic world of cryptocurrency. It underscores the importance of robust security measures, regulatory compliance, and user protection in the digital asset space. Whether WazirX can successfully navigate these challenges and achieve a successful WazirX relaunch remains to be seen, but the upcoming Singapore court decision is a pivotal moment in this unfolding narrative. Conclusion: A Test of Resilience and Trust in the Crypto World WazirX’s journey towards a potential relaunch is a gripping tale of resilience in the face of adversity. From the shockwaves of a massive crypto hack to the complexities of international legal proceedings, the exchange has faced a formidable battle. The upcoming Singapore court ruling on May 13 represents a critical juncture – a potential gateway to recovery or a further obstacle in their path. For users, investors, and the broader crypto community, the WazirX story serves as a potent reminder of both the risks and the transformative potential inherent in the world of digital currencies. The industry will be watching closely to see if WazirX can not only resume operations but also rebuild trust and emerge stronger from this challenging chapter.

Could May be the month that sparks growth for these two digital currencies? The article explores the signals and reasons behind the anticipated movement in APT and XLM, capturing the attention of investors. Aptos: Past Drops and Key Levels in Focus Aptos fell by 15.16% over the past month and dropped 51.49% over the last six months, with the week showing only a slight change of 0.06%. The coin has faced significant challenges, indicating a bearish market trend alongside limited short-term recovery. Historical data reveals a notable pullback, emphasizing the struggle of Aptos amidst widespread declines. Current prices are between $4.51 and $6.42. The nearest support is at $3.76, while resistance sits at $7.58, defining the immediate trading range. With bears in control, there is no clear upward trend. Trading ideas suggest buying near support levels and taking profits as prices approach resistance within this range. Stellar Price Trends: Mixed Month and Strong Six-Month Surge Stellar experienced a 10% drop over the past month but enjoyed a remarkable surge of nearly 160% over the last six months. The price action showed short-term recovery with a weekly gain of about 2.3% within a generally restricted range between $0.201 and $0.351 dollars. Historical data highlights strong long-term gains that contrast with recent short-term setbacks, suggesting a consolidation period before potential further moves. Current price levels remain near a resistance at $0.44 and a support at $0.14. With indicators like a near-neutral RSI around 47 and slightly negative momentum measures, neither bulls nor bears dominate clearly. Trading within these boundaries may present opportunities, as a breakout above 0.44 could signal renewed bullish activity, while a dip toward $0.14 may indicate further selling pressure. Conclusion APT and XLM show strong signs of potential growth. Indicators suggest that APT is preparing for a bullish move. Meanwhile, XLM appears to be gathering the momentum needed for a rebound. Analysts are optimistic that May could be a key period for both cryptocurrencies to experience significant upward trends.

The new payment network aims to take market share away from Ripple Payments, putting the two titans in a battle for supremacy. Circle’s new payments platform uses the USDC and EURC stablecoins to facilitate real-time, round-the-clock international money transfers. In addition, Circle challenges traditional payment rails with a stablecoin-powered substitute for worldwide payments without the delays of legacy systems. CPN focuses on payroll, treasury services, remittances, and invoice payments, and it has the support of more than 20 design partners. CPN is set to transform the global payment network The initiative aims to address the aging infrastructure of global finance. C ircle says banks and payment providers can move money “at internet speed” through programmable and secure, always-available transfers. The company shared an X post stating that the Circle Payments Network will offer financial institutions near-instantaneous, affordable, and 24/7 settlement. The launch represents a strategic expansion of Circle’s role from a stablecoin issuer to a provider of the infrastructure that moves those assets at scale. Circle’s chief product officer and technology officer, Nikhil Chandhok, highlighted that Circle Payments Network facilitates stablecoin payments, allowing payment providers to quickly access new markets and business models. In addition to almost instantaneous settlement times, Circle says it will provide partner financial institutions with a single tech stack for simple onboarding. Circle hit the ground running, securing early support from design partners for CPN, including Flutterwave, CoinMENA, Coins.ph, WorldRemit, and Yellow Card. Moreover, for the CPN project, Circle enlisted the help of Deutsche Bank, Santander, Standard Chartered, and Societe Generale as advisors. Circle expressed that they were not merely creating stablecoins but constructing a cutting-edge global payments infrastructure with the CPN project. Meanwhile, as stablecoin issuers like Circle look to broaden the range of their offerings, the STABLE Act’s passage is giving them regulatory guidance. CPN launches a fierce battle against Ripple Payment Ripple Payments and Circle’s CPN launch are expected to compete for market share in the upcoming months. Currently, Ripple has a competitive edge in the financial ecosystem. Some factors that have contributed to this include the introduction of its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product. Compared to more conventional options, banks can process international transactions more affordably with Ripple Payments , which runs on the XRP Ledger. However, despite these factors, CPN is positioned to compete directly with Ripple Payments with its numerous early alliances. Although Ripple has a long list of partnerships, its integration with SWIFT is expected to be the cherry on top regarding adoption metrics and XRP price. Moreover, Ripple is exploring the possibility of an IPO . Notably, Circle and Ripple are vying for market share following the US’s decision to rely on stablecoins to maintain the dollar’s dominance. Circle claims that with a market valuation of over $60 billion, USDC is the biggest regulated stablecoin. On the other hand, Ripple claims that its RLUSD stablecoin, which is denominated in US dollars, is the one that is expanding the fastest in the financial ecosystem. In addition, its strong fundamentals recorded a 100% increase in trading volumes. According to CoinGecko , USD stablecoins now boast a combined market cap north of $231 billion, with over $37 billion traded in the past 24 hours. Tether’s USDT continues to dominate at $144 billion, while Circle’s USDC accounts for around $60 billion of the market.

Author and bitcoin supporter Parker Lewis called Silbert and Raoul Pal, the presenter of The Journey Man podcast, a group of "" affinity scammers "" for promoting TAO on a recent episode. Silbert responded by writing: ""calling $TAO a scam is such a lazy attack. do better"" Grayscale Investments, one of Digital Currency Group's subsidiaries, runs a Bittensor Trust that currently has around $8 million in assets under management. It also has a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (GBTC) with $16.6 billion under management as well as a bitcoin mini trust ETF. What is TAO? Silbert sparked the bitcoiners' ire by comparing Bittensor to the Bitcoin blockchain. ""It's just like bitcoin, there was a white paper that turned into code then launched and it has the same token economics,"" he said in the podcast. While there are some similarities to BTC in that TAO's supply is capped at 21 million tokens and it goes through block reward halving events, there are also stark differences in terms of the project's ethos and use case. Bittensor is a decentralized network that merges blockchain technology with machine learning. It was designed to become a peer-to-peer AI market, where users can share and monetize AI models. Bitcoin was spawned out of the Libertarian cypherpunk era and designed primarily as a peer-to-peer payment method that avoided government-issued currency. In recent years has also emerged a store of value, becoming a mainstay on company balance sheets to mitigate rising inflation. The TAO token was released two years ago and has experienced extreme volatility, rising to above $700 on two occasions in 2024 before cratering to around $200 both times. It was trading recently around $339. Bitcoin, meanwhile, has risen from $22,000 since the start of 2023 to as high as $109,000 in January. While it's had its ups and downs, they're not as marked as the plunges typically seen across the altcoin market. Bitcoin is currently priced around $90,000 with a market cap about $1.8 trillion.

As XRP trades at $2.084, its market cap stands at $120.65 billion while demonstrating consistent market movement with a daily increase of 0.30%. The platform maintains its current value because of its ability to facilitate quick international transactions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has captured strong attention despite its recent market entry. MUTM attracts investors during its phase 4 presale at $0.025 because it has raised $7 million while selling 417 million tokens to its present 8,400 holders. Revenue projections show MUTM will deliver better returns than XRP through its existing lending framework. Ripple (XRP) Outlook The technical signals signify optimistic prospects as XRP maintains its position at $2.084. Both the 50-day Simple Moving Average stands at $2.26 and the 200-day SMA maintains a level of $1.89 which indicates a balanced outlook. The asset’s volatility is 8.22% with RSI at 47.43 position which indicates equal selling and buying tension between market participants. The established network of XRP provides quick global payment capabilities as its main strength. The projected market value increase for XRP will reach $3.77 by end of 2025 following its increased cooperation with banking institutions. The expansion pace of XRP appears small next to emerging decentralized finance projects. XRP maintains its upward trajectory but investors among them lack passion for its low-exploding value in the modern cryptocurrency market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) generates intensive market interest as it advances in its prepaid token sale cycle. During its ongoing fourth presale phase Mutuum Finance sells its tokens at $0.025 each. The fundraising success exceeds $7 million and 417 million tokens now rest in the wallets of 8,400 investors. Phase 5 of the presale will increase the token price by 20% from $0.03 to $0.036 but existing buyers will obtain a 20% profit boost. Forthcoming investors who obtain MUTM at $0.06 will achieve 140% capital growth on their initial investment. Some analysts expect MUTM to experience a price boost after its launch which could reach $2.50 and provide investors with a remarkable 9.900% return on investment. The team is finalizing a Certik audit of its smart contract, with results soon to be shared on social platforms, boosting transparency. MUTM’s Innovative Edge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) establishes its market position through its decentralized lending services. Through its system users have the option to deposit assets into liquidity pools or borrow funds through collateral posting thus creating a secure stability which remains overcollateralized. MUTM platform distributes its revenue through an acquisition mechanism that repurchases MUTM tokens which are then distributed to stakers. Constant demand exists due to its operation model rather than XRP’s requirement of user adoption. MUTM launched a dashboard featuring the top 50 token holders who obtain bonus tokens for preserving their position which pushes individuals to join the platform as quickly as possible. The fourth phase of selling is currently in a rapid deterioration state and the upcoming listing creates a reduced opportunity for token acquisition at current prices. Why MUTM Could Outshine XRP XRP’s future price projection of $3.77 for 2025 looks strong yet it remains inferior to Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s forecasted value. The lending features of MUTM deliver genuine value to users alongside its presale system that generously compensates inaugural participants. MUTM’s listing value offers investors a guaranteed 140% return immediately followed by a $2.50 post-launch sentiment that creates magnificent investment gains. MUTM presents quicker growth compared to XRP since it combines increasing demand with its decentralized finance solutions. The scarcity of phase 4 tokens results in growing FOMO sentiments among investors.

43673237,https://blockworks.co/news/cost-of-mining-btc-since-halving,1745337616,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,"A year after the Bitcoin halving, how much does 1 BTC cost to mine?",https://blockworks.co/news/cost-of-mining-btc-since-halving,"This is a segment from the Supply Shock newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . We all know halvings double the cost of production, a fact the media tends to dress up as an existential threat to Bitcoin every four years. Miners seeking profit must also contend with fluctuating difficulty and energy costs. But if the price goes up, at least they’d get more money for every coin they mine. At $88,500, bitcoin is ahead by 36% since the halving. More importantly, it’s up 130% on the average price during the last phase of the prior halving cycle (more than double!) As it goes, high prices attract more miners, which have driven bitcoin’s total hash rate to all-time highs alongside the difficulty. In fact, while mining revenue is more-or-less in line with its five-year average, the difficulty is currently five times what it was in April 2021, and 40% higher than just before the last halving. So, it’s harder than ever to generate bitcoins. But how much does it cost to mine 1 BTC right now? Always hard to say, with the answer highly dependent on electricity and other overhead costs, although Cambridge currently estimates $48,671 per coin. Strong bitcoin prices have kept miner revenue almost on par with peak 2021 and 2024 bull markets (source: Blockworks Research ). Let’s use Marathon, the $4 billion mining giant responsible for about 7% of Bitcoin’s total hash rate, as an example. In the three quarters leading up to the most recent halving, Marathon’s cost of mining revenues were $224.95 million, according to its SEC filings. Marathon mined in total 10,542 BTC over the same period, which puts the estimated cost of producing each coin at just under $21,500. Bitcoin traded at $39,300 on average over that time, implying potential profit of $17,800 per coin. Across the third and fourth quarters of last year, Marathon’s estimated cost of production using the same method works out at $43,270 — correctly doubling since the halving and in line with Cambridge’s estimate — against an average trade price of $72,250. That suggests potential profit of nearly $29,000, which is even higher than before the halving. (Marathon CEO Fred Thiel said in February that Marathon’s direct energy cost per bitcoin for last year was $28,801 overall, although that would include some of the previous epoch, before the cost of production doubled. Marathon profited over half a billion dollars in Q4 2024) One year on from the halving and based on Marathon’s figures, the bitcoin block subsidy is still lucrative enough, at least at current prices for the most well capitalised operations. Other miners might sometimes run at a loss, going by Luxor’s Hashrate Index , which points to some of the lowest profitability on record. Understandable, given five halvings have passed. In any case, Bitcoin has three years left to double in price to counteract the next one. Plenty of time. Money is speech “I’m sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume.” Satoshi said that on Valentine’s Day in 2010 — a little over 15 years ago. It was an addendum to a comment about the necessity for transaction fees in a system that sees block rewards cut to zero over time. “In a few decades when the reward gets too small, the transaction fee will become the main compensation for nodes.” So, how close is Satoshi to the truth, less than five years out from his hypothetical? Monthly transfer volume has fallen in recent months but is still way up 2023 (source: Blockworks Research ). Bitcoin processes more than 11.5 million transactions per month, up from under 8 million in early 2022, converting to $1.8 trillion BTC in volume on average. On one hand, that might be “very large,” like Satoshi predicted, but over 98% of miner revenue still comes from the block subsidy. A few more halvings and the current dynamic may no longer be tenable, so expect debate over Bitcoin’s fee market structure to ramp up over time. For more on the reasons to be alarmed, you can listen to core developer James O’Beirne on today’s episode of Supply Shock . Rizzo’s view, on this day You might hear the phrase “Bitcoin bubble” a lot these days, what with prices surging over $100,000. A look back at media articles from the past, however, and not much has changed. On Reddit, I posted this chart as a reminder of just how long the trope has lasted. In fact, the above chart was posted by Coin Center founder Jerry Brito , 14 years ago. There he wrote about how even if Bitcoin died, the technology was here to stay.

However, alongside the renewed enthusiasm for established assets, a new class of fast-moving altcoins is capturing the attention of both analysts and early traders. Among them, MAGACOINFINANCE is emerging as the project many believe could outperform even the biggest names in crypto before the year is over. PRESALE SELLING OUT – CLICK HERE TO SECURE A SPOT NOW Why MAGACOINFINANCE Has Everyone Watching Closely Within minutes of going live, MAGACOINFINANCE surged with early momentum — confirming what many investors already suspected: this is 2025’s most-watched opportunity. Now, several key indicators suggest that momentum wasn’t just a flash—it’s part of a sustained surge. Trading sentiment remains high, wallet growth is consistent, and social traction continues to rise week over week. The appeal isn’t just in potential—it’s in timing. Unlike many tokens that enter the spotlight after the biggest move has already happened, MAGACOINFINANCE is still early. It’s building community strength and user adoption at a pace typically seen just before steep valuation climbs. This pre-discovery phase is precisely where high-ROI opportunities often begin. Comparing MAGACOINFINANCE to Ethereum, Solana, Optimism, and Injective Ethereum remains the foundational Layer-1 for decentralized applications, but it’s become more of a macro asset than a high-velocity play. Solana continues to lead the conversation on scalability and speed, though its rapid rise in previous years has left less room for parabolic growth. Optimism is performing well as a Layer-2 network, yet the competition in this space is growing. Injective is making moves in decentralized finance, but its niche use case limits broader market excitement. In contrast, MAGACOINFINANCE offers a full-package appeal: early-stage exposure, clean tokenomics, and rising market recognition.

43673425,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=151474,1745338218,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unfortunate Blow: Korean Court Upholds Bithumb’s ZBCN Token Delisting,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/korean-court-bithumb-zebec-delisting/,"In a significant development for the South Korean crypto market, the Zebec Foundation has suffered a setback in its legal battle against crypto exchange Bithumb. A Korean court has dismissed the injunction filed by Zebec, aimed at preventing the delisting of its native token, ZBCN, from the exchange. This ruling intensifies the scrutiny surrounding crypto exchange delistings and their impact on token projects and investors. Let’s delve deeper into what this decision means for Zebec, Bithumb, and the broader crypto landscape. Why is Bithumb Delisting ZBCN Token? The core question on everyone’s mind is: why did Bithumb decide to delist the ZBCN token in the first place? While the exact reasons from Bithumb haven’t been explicitly detailed in the public domain, crypto exchanges typically delist tokens for a variety of reasons. These often include: Low Trading Volume and Liquidity: If a token consistently shows low trading volume, it may not be economically viable for an exchange to continue supporting it. Delisting can streamline operations and focus resources on more actively traded assets. Regulatory Concerns: Increased regulatory scrutiny in South Korea and globally means exchanges are under pressure to ensure all listed tokens comply with evolving legal frameworks. Tokens that pose regulatory risks, or fail to meet compliance standards, could face delisting. Project Issues or Lack of Development: If a crypto project shows signs of stagnation, lack of development activity, or faces internal issues, exchanges might deem it too risky to continue listing the associated token. Security Vulnerabilities: Discovery of security flaws or vulnerabilities in a token’s smart contract or blockchain can also lead to delisting to protect users and the exchange’s reputation. Market Manipulation or Suspicious Activity: Exchanges monitor trading activity closely. Signs of market manipulation, wash trading, or other suspicious activities related to a token can trigger a delisting review. In the case of Zebec Foundation and the ZBCN token, the specific reasons for Bithumb’s delisting decision remain somewhat unclear publicly. However, the exchange likely had concerns related to one or more of the factors mentioned above. It’s crucial to note that exchanges like Bithumb have a responsibility to maintain a healthy and secure trading environment for their users. The Zebec Foundation’s Legal Challenge: Fighting the Delisting Upon receiving notice of the impending Bithumb delisting , the Zebec Foundation took a significant step to challenge this decision. They filed an injunction with a South Korean court, seeking to halt the delisting process. This legal action highlights the seriousness with which Zebec viewed the delisting and its potential ramifications. Filing an injunction is a legal maneuver to prevent an action from taking place, at least temporarily, until a court can fully review the matter. In this context, Zebec was essentially asking the court to intervene and prevent Bithumb from removing ZBCN from its trading platform while the merits of the delisting were being argued. Why would Zebec Foundation fight so hard against the delisting ? Here are a few possible reasons: Token Value and Ecosystem Impact: Delisting from a major exchange like Bithumb can significantly impact a token’s price and liquidity. It reduces accessibility for traders and investors, potentially leading to a decrease in value and hindering the token’s ecosystem growth. Reputational Damage: A delisting, even if contested, can be perceived negatively by the market. It can raise concerns about the project’s viability and reputation, making it harder to attract new users and partners. Loss of Trading Platform: Bithumb is a prominent crypto exchange in South Korea. Being delisted from such a platform reduces ZBCN’s visibility and trading opportunities in a key market. Setting a Precedent: Zebec might have been concerned about setting a precedent where exchanges could delist tokens without sufficient justification or due process. Fighting the delisting could be seen as a move to protect not just ZBCN but also other crypto projects from potentially arbitrary delisting decisions. Despite these compelling reasons, the Korean court ultimately dismissed Zebec Foundation’s injunction, siding with Bithumb and allowing the delisting to proceed. Court Dismissal: What Does This Mean for ZBCN and Zebec? The Korean court dismissing the injunction is undoubtedly a setback for Zebec Foundation and ZBCN token holders. Let’s break down the potential implications: Impact Area Potential Consequences Token Price Likely to experience downward pressure due to reduced accessibility and negative sentiment surrounding delisting. Liquidity Expected to decrease significantly, making it harder to trade ZBCN, especially in the Korean market. Investor Confidence May erode as investors might perceive the delisting and court dismissal as negative signals about the project’s future. Ecosystem Growth Could be hampered due to reduced market access and potential reputational damage, making it more challenging to expand the Zebec ecosystem. Future Exchange Listings Might become more difficult, as other exchanges may be hesitant to list a token recently delisted from a major platform like Bithumb. Zebec Foundation’s Strategy The foundation will need to reassess its strategy, focusing on alternative exchanges, community engagement, and project development to mitigate the impact of the delisting. While the court’s decision is a blow, it’s not necessarily the end of the road for Zebec. Many crypto projects have faced exchange delistings and successfully navigated the challenges. The key for Zebec now is to focus on what it can control: strengthening its project fundamentals, community support, and exploring alternative avenues for token trading and utility. Navigating the Aftermath: What’s Next for Zebec and ZBCN? In the wake of this unfortunate court ruling, Zebec Foundation needs to take decisive action to mitigate the negative impacts of the Bithumb delisting . Here are some actionable steps they could consider: Communicate Transparently: Open and honest communication with the ZBCN community is paramount. Zebec should clearly explain the situation, the court’s decision, and their plan moving forward. Addressing community concerns and maintaining trust is crucial. Explore Alternative Exchanges: Proactively seek listings on other reputable crypto exchanges, both in South Korea and internationally. Diversifying trading platforms can help regain market access and liquidity. Focus on Project Development and Utility: Double down on developing and enhancing the Zebec ecosystem. Demonstrating real-world use cases and driving adoption of the ZBCN token can build long-term value, regardless of exchange listings. Community Engagement and Support: Actively engage with the ZBCN community. Foster a strong and supportive community that believes in the project’s vision. Community strength can be a powerful asset during challenging times. Legal and Regulatory Strategy Review: Analyze the legal and regulatory landscape in South Korea and globally. Ensure full compliance and proactively address any potential regulatory concerns to avoid future delisting issues. The crypto market is dynamic and resilient. Setbacks like exchange delistings, while challenging, can also be catalysts for innovation and adaptation. Zebec Foundation’s response in the coming weeks and months will be critical in determining the long-term trajectory of the ZBCN token and the project as a whole. Final Thoughts: Delisting and the Evolving Crypto Landscape The Zebec Foundation case underscores the complexities and uncertainties within the cryptocurrency market. Bithumb delisting of ZBCN and the subsequent court dismissal serve as a stark reminder of the power exchanges hold and the potential challenges projects face in navigating regulatory and market dynamics. For investors and project teams alike, this situation highlights the importance of due diligence, risk management, and adaptability in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. The dismissal of Zebec’s injunction is a significant event in the South Korean crypto scene, raising questions about exchange accountability, delisting procedures, and the rights of token projects.
