This has raised concerns among investors of WazirX who worry about its future. During a recent interview he had with TheStreet Roundtable host Mehab Qureshi, Shetty revealed that the long-running ownership dispute between WazirX and Binance has moved into litigation. “End of the day, I think it’s now gone into a stage of litigation,” he reportedly claimed. Ownership dispute between WazirX and Binance During the conversation, Shetty reiterated that WazirX was sold around late 2019-early 2020, following a public announcement at the time. However, what followed were conflicting claims, which saw both sides publicly disputing ownership of the platform. Binance denied holding any stake in WazirX. However, the Indian exchange claimed to have all the legal documents proving otherwise, which is how the ownership dispute began. As things stand, Shetty claims the dispute is at a “he said, she said” stage, which makes the outcome of the litigation much more important. When Shetty was asked whether Binance reached out to WazirX following the hack that shook the platform in July 2024, Shetty declined to comment, claiming the matter is under sub-judice. This is the latest development regarding the case, whose origins can be traced to the year 2019, after the crypto company announced that Binance had acquired it. What did Shetty say abou t cu stody dispute with Liminal? During his talk with TheStreet Roundtable host Mehab Qureshi, Shetty also addressed its dispute with Liminal, a digital asset custody and wallet infrastructure platform designed to help institutions, crypto exchanges, and digital asset businesses securely manage and store cryptocurrencies and tokenized assets. After the initial shock of the July 2024 hack that rocked WazirX by targeting its multi-signature wallet and resulting in a loss of over $230 million, the exchange blamed Liminal, claiming it was linked to Liminal’s multi-signature wallet infrastructure. It also pledged to migrate all remaining assets to a new multi-signature wallet, promising full transparency by publishing a list of all new wallets post-migration. Things got interesting when Liminal issued a counter-statement on October 22, 2024, denying responsibility for the breach. It claimed that 75 days after the hack, WazirX still held more than $175 million in assets on its platform, with roughly $50 million still under WazirX’s control via Liminal’s infrastructure. While in a conversation with TheStreet Roundtable host Mehab Qureshi, Shetty confirmed that the exchange had indeed been using Liminal’s software for custody infrastructure, but WazirX itself was always the primary point of contact for users. Shetty claims the exchange used Liminal’s technology for multi-key security with address whitelisting, ensuring that transactions could only be approved for preapproved wallets. “This was done so that even if all the devices of our team members got compromised, there’s a third party that would do the final check before authorizing a transaction,” he said. WazirX has claimed the cyberattack occurred through an external website used for fund management, not its own servers or hot wallets. “The cyber attack was not on the infrastructure, like the service of WazirX,” Shetty said . “It was a website that we were using for managing these funds, and through that website, the cyber attack happened”. According to him, the exchange had limited visibility into what happened “behind the scenes of a different website” and is awaiting further details from Liminal. “We only know our part. We have three laptops that were interacting with our website. Now we don’t know anything beyond that,” Shetty stated. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

In a detailed thread on X, Gaevoy said Wintermute disagrees with the proposal “as it stands,” while arguing that it asks tokenholders to commit to a major course of action without sufficient clarity on structure, governance, or outcomes. He disclosed that Wintermute has been an investor in AAVE since 2022 and participates actively in governance, but neither he nor the firm has any equity exposure to Aave Labs. Wintermute Slams Proposal According to the exec, the main issue is value accrual and a widening expectation mismatch between Aave Labs and a significant portion of AAVE tokenholders over who should capture value and how key external functions, particularly business development, should operate. He said those unresolved tensions make the current proposal premature and potentially harmful. Gaevoy also criticized the tone and politics surrounding the vote. While acknowledging that Aave founder Stani Kulechov’s communications “have been far from perfect,” he said the backlash against Aave Labs has gone too far and has negatively impacted the token’s price. Both sides, he added, are accusing each other of “hostile takeovers,” a claim he said has some validity depending on perspective. Gaevoy also said that reversing or softening earlier decisions, such as fee-related changes, could have helped reset the situation. But instead, the dispute escalated. He framed the vote as a “temperature check” rather than a decisive endpoint, saying the real priority should be de-escalation and serious work on long-term solutions for token value capture. While urging Aave Labs to engage constructively after the vote, Gaevoy wrote, “Whether it succeeds or fails doesn’t really matter.” The comments come as the token alignment proposal appears unlikely to pass. Snapshot data shows that a majority of AAVE DAO voters are opposed or abstaining, with roughly 55% voting against the proposal, about 41% abstaining, and 3.5% voting in favor. Voting is set for December 26. Critics have argued that Aave Labs rushed the governance process and pushed the proposal to a vote while discussions were still ongoing. The broader dispute traces back to a conflict over swap fee diversion, worth millions of dollars, that would have benefited the company rather than the DAO treasury. The alignment proposal itself focuses on tokenholders seeking control over Aave’s brand assets, including domains, social media accounts, and naming rights. The end goal is to ensure that any entity holding those assets remains accountable to the DAO. 2026 Roadmap Prior to the governance tensions, the platform laid out an ambitious roadmap for 2026 that aims to scale the protocol well beyond its current footprint. Kulechov unveiled the plan, which centers on three pillars: Aave V4, Horizon, and the Aave App. Aave V4 is expected to redesign the lending protocol to reduce liquidity fragmentation and support much larger capital flows. Horizon focuses on institutional users, allowing firms to borrow against tokenized real-world assets such as US Treasuries while meeting compliance needs. Meanwhile, the Aave App is positioned as a consumer-facing product aimed at onboarding millions of new users as Aave targets broader adoption.

Many investors are no longer chasing short-term moves. Instead, they are asking a more important question. Which cryptocurrencies still have room to grow before the next cycle matures? This is often when familiar names are re-evaluated and newer projects begin to stand out. Some are already showing early strength, even while prices remain low. That is why conversations around the best crypto to buy now are starting to include both established leaders and one new altcoin that has already climbed 250% while staying under $0.1. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum remains the backbone of much of the cryptocurrency market. Its ecosystem supports DeFi, NFTs, and a wide range of applications. With a massive market cap, ETH is often seen as a core holding rather than a high-growth play. Early investors benefited from strong moves when Ethereum was still building its foundation. Today, Ethereum faces a different challenge. Price action has repeatedly slowed near the $3,000 level. Many market commentators see this area as a major resistance zone. Breaking and holding above it has proven difficult without broad market momentum. This does not mean Ethereum lacks value. It means its growth profile has changed. At its current size, even strong adoption often translates into more gradual price movement. For investors looking for the next big cryptocurrency with higher upside potential, ETH’s role is increasingly about stability rather than acceleration. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu tells a different story. SHIB was one of the most talked-about crypto coins during its early surge. Early holders saw dramatic gains as attention poured in and price moved rapidly from near-zero levels. Now, SHIB faces its own resistance. Price action has struggled around the $0.00001 level. Market commentators often point out that SHIB’s large circulating supply makes sustained upward movement more difficult without renewed interest on a massive scale. While Shiba Inu still has a loyal community, its growth relies heavily on sentiment rather than utility. For many investors, that creates uncertainty when thinking about long-term positioning. This is why some are starting to shift focus toward projects with clearer use cases. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new DeFi crypto focused on decentralized lending and borrowing. Unlike meme-driven projects, its value proposition is tied directly to utility. Users will be able to supply assets, earn yield, and borrow against collateral in a system designed to adjust rates based on real usage. The presale began in early 2025 and has progressed steadily. The current token price is $0.035, and the project has already raised $19.45M. Participation has grown to 18,650 holders, with 825M tokens sold so far. Out of a fixed 4B total supply, 45.5% is allocated to the presale, equal to roughly 1.82B tokens. Phase 6 is now over 99% allocated, which means supply at the current price is nearly exhausted. Since Phase 1, the token has already climbed 250%, yet it remains well under $0.1. For those tracking crypto prices today and asking which crypto to buy now for long-term growth, this combination of low price and strong traction is drawing attention. MUTM vs SHIB Analysts often compare opportunities using practical examples. Consider a $500 investment. A $500 position in SHIB today depends largely on renewed hype to deliver strong returns. Given its large supply and established valuation, even optimistic scenarios tend to point toward more modest growth unless market conditions shift dramatically. A $500 position in MUTM at $0.035 offers a different profile. The official launch price is set at $0.06, which already represents a clear step up from current levels. Some analysts believe that if adoption develops as expected, MUTM could see 200% to 300% growth after launch. In more bullish scenarios tied to usage and exchange visibility, projections show even higher outcomes over time. This is not about guarantees. It is about structure. SHIB relies on sentiment. MUTM relies on a working protocol and demand tied to usage. V1 Launch and Security as Key Differentiators One reason analysts view Mutuum Finance as a stronger long-term contender is its development roadmap. According to official statements shared on X, V1 of the lending and borrowing protocol is planned for the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. Core features include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an automated liquidator bot. Initial supported assets will be ETH and USDT. Security has also been addressed early. Mutuum Finance has completed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 token scan score. An independent audit with Halborn Security is currently underway, reviewing finalized contracts. A $50k bug bounty has been launched to identify code vulnerabilities. As 2026 approaches, the question of what is the best cryptocurrency to invest in depends on goals. Ethereum offers scale and stability. Shiba Inu offers community and familiarity. Mutuum Finance offers early-stage exposure with a focus on real utility. For investors looking at the potential best crypto to buy now with an eye on growth rather than hype, this new altcoin under $0.1 is increasingly part of the conversation. With Phase 6 nearly complete and V1 on the horizon, Mutuum Finance is entering a stage where early traction and future potential begin to align.

56419499,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=884663,1766786403,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56419499.jpeg,"Investors are using funds, bars, coins, and miners to get exposure to silver",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/all-the-ways-silver-is-bought-and-sold/,"Silver broke $79 an ounce on Friday for the first time ever, capping off a run that’s left gold in the dust and dragged every other precious metal into the rally. Year-to-date, silver has surged more than 150% , way ahead of gold’s 70% rise. The rally has been tied to a mix of tight supplies, industrial buying, retail hoarding, and the U.S. under Donald Trump, labeling it a “critical mineral” in 2025. Buyers in solar, investment firms, and regular retail traders have all jumped in too, so this metal that would’ve gone to factories has instead ended up locked in vaults and ETFs. The largest volume of physical silver changes hands in London, where banks and brokers connect large institutional clients to the market. The trades happen over the counter, between two parties, not on an exchange. But this isn’t retail territory, folks, so you need a relationship with a major player to get in. HSBC and JPMorgan are two of the key banks storing the metal. As of late press time, these guys hold about 27,187 tons of silver in vaults across the city. There’s also the futures market, which handles massive volumes without anyone physically touching the metal. Two key hubs are the Shanghai Futures Exchange and COMEX in New York, run by CME Group, both allowing buyers and sellers to agree on a price today for silver that’s technically due later. But most people don’t wait, so the contracts are swapped out for newer ones, letting traders speculate without needing to store metal. Another perk is that the buyers don’t pay the full price up front. They only put up a margin, a small portion of the total value. Investors also use funds, bars, coins, and miners to get exposure to silver For retail investors (a.k.a. ‘dumb money’), silver ETFs have become the easiest way to get exposure, since, of course, they’re traded on platforms like NYSE and LSE, and sold on Robinhood (retailers’ favorite spot). Naturally, the biggest ETF is the iShares Silver Trust, managed by BlackRock, which holds around 529 million ounces, about $39 billion worth at current prices, according to data from the world’s largest asset manager itself. If enough buyers pile in and push the iShares silver ETF price above the real value of the metal, the fund adds more silver to its stash and issues new shares, because the goal here is to keep prices aligned. Some retailers still sell silver bars and coins to individual buyers, but it’s slower, and usually more expensive, though you’d be holding actual metal, so there is that. Some investors go another route too, like buying shares in mining companies whose stocks are easy to trade and tend to rise or fall with silver prices. But there’s more risk here; company debt, poor leadership, or bad earnings reports can crush a stock even if the metal is rallying. The surge in prices is also tied to supply hitting a wall. Most of the world’s major silver deposits have been exhausted, and new production isn’t keeping up. At the same time, solar manufacturers are buying more than ever. Retail traders are also stockpiling, choking the pipeline that would normally feed industrial demand. Not everyone’s bullish. Some traders argue that the silver market is too small and too volatile. Rachel Kwon, head of commodities at Luma Capital, warned , “This market can double or crash in weeks. There’s no in-between.” Still, others believe there’s more room to run. Some bulls say silver would need to jump above $200 an ounce to beat its 1980 inflation-adjusted high. While silver dominated headlines, gold also closed higher, hitting a record of $4,549.71 before settling at $4,552.70 for February futures. Platinum surged 9.8% to $2,437.72, reaching a peak of $2,454.12, and palladium spiked 14% to $1,927.81, its best level in over three years. All major precious metals logged weekly gains, with platinum posting its strongest performance on record. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

The company now tracks “European Commission fines” as a standard expense. The total reached $10.5 billion by September 30. This shows how penalties from the EU have become routine for the largest U.S. tech firms operating in Europe. In 2024, public technology companies based in Europe paid €3.2 billion in income tax. During the same year, regulators collected €3.8 billion in fines from U.S. technology firms. That means penalties alone exceeded the entire tax contribution of the listed European tech companies. Officials inside the bloc privately acknowledge that if SAP relocated operations to the United States, nearly half of that tax base would disappear, leaving fines as a growing revenue stream for the EU. EU regulators stack fines on Google across ads, Android, and AI The European Commission first fined Google €2.95 billion for adtech abuses tied to self-preferencing and conflicts inside its advertising supply chain. Regulators ordered the company to stop favoring its own ad services and restructure how it handles auctions and placement tools across Europe. Earlier rulings targeted mobile dominance. The Commission issued a €4.34 billion fine over illegal Android practices that forced device makers to pre-install Google Search and Chrome. Officials said those deals locked out rivals before users ever turned on their phones. Enforcement did not stop there. In December 2025, regulators opened a fresh investigation into whether Google uses publisher content and YouTube material to train its AI Overviews without fair payment. The probe focuses on whether that conduct harms competitors while boosting Google’s AI products inside the EU. EU laws pull Washington into a widening political clash Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has accused Brussels of targeting U.S. firms while allowing European companies to operate freely in America. His administration has warned of retaliation if enforcement continues. The U.S. State Department said this week it would deny visas to a former European commissioner and four others, stating they “have advanced censorship crackdowns by foreign states, in each case targeting American speakers and American companies.” Tensions escalated after the launch of the Digital Services Act, which apparently governs content moderation on social platforms, per the Commission’s notice . Shortly after, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative accused the EU and several member states of pushing “discriminatory and harassing lawsuits, taxes, fines and directives” against U.S. service providers while firms like Accenture, DHL, Siemens, and Spotify operate without similar barriers in the United States. Elon Musk’s platform X received the first fine under the DSA on December 5, totaling €120 million, or about $140 million, for design practices tied to the blue check system and allegedly blocking researcher access to public data, according to the EU. Alongside the DSA, the Digital Markets Act now governs competition. Seven gatekeepers fall under its scope: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Microsoft, Meta, and Booking.com. The DSA law strictly bans any forced use of pre-installed services, and it also requires an open App store choice from Apple, along with mandates on messaging interoperability. Apple had to pay €500 million in April for blocking alternative payments, while Meta paid €200 million for data use violations tied to Facebook and Instagram. European Commission president Urusula von der Lyn warned that repeat breaches from these companies will lead to penalties reaching 20% of global turnover.

Price remains capped below the $90,000 level, with repeated recovery attempts failing to gain traction. As volatility compresses and participation thins, an increasing number of analysts are warning that the market may face further downside before stability can return. For now, conviction on both sides remains limited, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to renewed selling pressure. On-chain data underscores this fragile backdrop. A recent report by Axel Adler examines daily capital inflows and outflows across the Bitcoin network, using a seven-day moving average of net capital flow to assess market health. This metric captures the balance between realized profits, which represent capital entering the network, and realized losses, which reflect capital being destroyed through loss-making sales. When the net flow turns negative, it signals that participants are selling at a loss more aggressively than they are taking profits. Currently, the seven-day average stands at approximately negative $160 million, meaning the market has been losing an average of $160 million in capital per day over the past week. The period between December 17 and 24 was marked by sharp volatility , with large outflows interspersed with brief positive days. Although December 25 saw another net inflow, it was not enough to offset prior losses. Elevated Coin Activity Signals Distribution Under the Surface On-chain data highlighted by Adler shows that Bitcoin remains unusually active despite weak market conditions. The Bitcoin “% Supply Active (Last 180 Days)” metric tracks the share of total BTC supply that has moved at least once over the past six months. Currently, that figure stands at 31.79%, slightly above its 30-day average of 31.43% and firmly in the 80th percentile compared with historical data. Activity has also risen sharply on a year-over-year basis, up 14.4%, indicating that coins are changing hands far more frequently than they were a year ago. At face value, elevated activity can sometimes signal renewed interest or accumulation. In the current context, however, it carries a more cautionary implication. High supply activity is occurring alongside a negative net capital flow regime, meaning that much of this movement reflects loss-making sales rather than profitable distribution. Coins are not simply rotating between long-term holders; they are being sold under pressure. This combination challenges the idea that the market is simply apathetic. Instead, it points to active distribution, with holders choosing to exit positions despite unfavorable prices. The distinction is important: apathy implies indecision, while distribution suggests stress. For this metric to turn constructive, elevated activity would need to persist while net capital flows recover toward zero or positive territory. Only then would increased coin movement begin to reflect accumulation rather than capitulation. Bitcoin Stabilizes As Key Trend Loses Momentum Bitcoin is trading around the $88,700 level on the 3-day chart, attempting to stabilize after a sharp correction from the $120,000–$125,000 highs set earlier in the year. While the broader uptrend that began in 2024 remains technically intact, the current structure reflects a clear loss of momentum and a transition into a corrective phase. Price action has shifted from strong impulsive moves to choppy consolidation, highlighting growing uncertainty among market participants. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin is now trading below its faster-moving average, which has rolled over and begun acting as dynamic resistance. The loss of this level marked a decisive change in market character, confirming that rallies are being sold rather than extended. At the same time, price is hovering just above the rising longer-term moving average, which continues to provide structural support and defines the boundary between a healthy correction and a deeper trend reversal. Volume dynamics reinforce the cautious outlook. The most aggressive volume expansion occurred during the sell-off from above $110,000, while the recent rebound toward $88,000 has unfolded on relatively muted participation. This suggests that selling pressure has eased, but buyers have not returned with conviction. Structurally, the $86,000–$90,000 range is critical. Holding above this zone preserves the broader bullish framework. However, a failure to reclaim the $95,000–$100,000 region would keep Bitcoin vulnerable to renewed downside pressure in the weeks ahead.

We asked the new version, GPT 5.2, to do price forecast for XRP, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu, and it delivered a quite interesting AI price outlook. Below are ChatGPT’s dual-scenario predictions outlining monumental potential gains and the downside hazards for each asset throughout December and going into 2026. Ripple (XRP): ChatGPT Predicts a Potential Rally To $4.20 If adoption for XRP declines and macro liquidity tightens, keeping XRP stuck below major resistance, ChatGPT AI predicts a total collapse for XRP to $1.20. That kind of drop would be completely out of character for XRP this year. After Ripple scored a major legal win against the SEC, XRP went on to hit a new all-time high around $3.65 in July. Most analysts think that momentum is not done yet. Even ChatGPT-based models are pointing to a possible move back into the $3.50 to $4.20 range as we head toward 2026. Between the RLUSD stablecoin launch, ongoing integrations, and growing adoption especially across Asia and Japan, plus steady ETF inflows, the setup is there. If the bull market keeps running, XRP breaking into fresh all-time highs in 2026 is very much on the table. Source: TradingView To fully reverse its downtrend, XRP needs to climb above the $2.2 level. This would break the token’s bearish price structure. This could set the stage for a strong recovery to $3 at least. A New Memecoins Cycle Could Be Led By Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Google Trends data shows that interest in memecoins has dropped to a five-year low. That loss of attention is showing up in the price too, with the memecoin sector down roughly 60% this year overall. For the Dogecoin bull case, ChatGPT sees momentum coming back in a big way, with DOGE potentially pushing into the $0.30 to $0.35 range heading into 2026. That outlook is built on the idea of a fresh memecoin cycle combined with a broader risk-on shift across the market. That is also why Bitcoin matters so much here. When BTC breaks out, capital usually rotates into memecoins, and as the leaders of the pack, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu tend to feel that move almost right away. The same story applies to Shiba Inu. It launched back in 2020 as a Dogecoin challenger and has since grown into a heavyweight, with a market cap sitting around $4.83 billion. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB also has a major network upgrade planned for 2026. The upgrade is expected to add a privacy layer, which could end up being the key catalyst that helps the token regain momentum when interest in memecoins picks back up. Shiba Inu is having a hard time finding any real momentum heading into Christmas, and the mood around it feels pretty undecided. SHIB is down roughly 1.7% over the last 24 hours. It has been stuck chopping in a tight range between $0.00000697 and $0.00000717. That kind of sideways action usually signals a sleepy market, and right now price is sitting closer to the bottom of that range. For this bounce to actually matter, SHIB needs to push above $0.00000800 and stay there. Maxi Doge Is Positioning For The Next Meme Rotation While ChatGPT is laying out big upside and downside scenarios for XRP, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu. Some traders are looking past the majors and focusing on where early momentum is quietly building. That is where Maxi Doge keeps popping up. Maxi Doge is leaning fully into the high-risk, high-reward side of the next memecoin cycle. When attention is low and sentiment is washed out. That is usually when early meme winners start getting accumulated before the crowd shows up. Right now, memecoin interest is near multi-year lows, which historically has been the exact environment where explosive rotations begin. The project has already raised over $4.28M, even while the broader memecoin sector looks completely dead. That kind of traction in a slow market suggests conviction, not hype chasing. On top of that, Maxi Doge is offering staking rewards up to 72% APY. This give holders a strong reason to lock in early and wait instead of flipping for short-term moves. If ChatGPT is right and 2026 brings renewed risk appetite and a fresh memecoin cycle. The biggest gains usually do not come from the old names everyone already owns. They come from the aggressive new plays that were built quietly during boredom phases. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu wait for momentum to return, Maxi Doge is already setting its base. When the rotation hits, that difference tends to matter fast. Maxi Doge is available through its presale using ETH, USDT, BNB, or a credit card directly on the official website .

A new hope is building that it will be the bullish year the market has been waiting for. XRP, Solana, and Cardano are all sitting on clean pullbacks and have been consolidating within steady price ranges for some time. Their next move higher may be approaching for the following reasons. Ripple (XRP): The OG Crypto That Could Still Be the Best Crypto Pick XRP ETFs have been pulling in serious money even while the price action looks completely dead. As of December 23, spot XRP ETFs logged about $1.13B in net inflows, with steady buying pressure holding up for the past 33 days. That performance actually puts them ahead of both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which have struggled to keep momentum during the same choppy market conditions. When you stack that ETF demand on top of ongoing ecosystem upgrades, major milestones, and a technically solid chart, 2026 is starting to look like it could be a really interesting year for XRP. Source: TradingView To fully reverse its downtrend, XRP needs to climb above the $2.2 level. This would break the token’s bearish price structure. This could set the stage for a strong recovery to $3 at least. Solana (SOL): The Coin of the Cycle Could Run It Back in 2026 Solana had an insane run starting in December 2024, topping out near $294 in January. Since then, it has been cut down hard and is now more than 50% off that peak. That kind of move is not new for SOL. Historically, it tends to overcorrect on the way down and then massively outperform once risk appetite comes back. Just look at the post-FTX collapse. SOL went from around $250 all the way down to about $8. A lot of people wrote it off for good, but it ended up ripping more than 30× after that. Source: TradingView As long as Solana stays above $120, the bullish setup is still intact. The big thing missing right now is volume. Buying pressure is pretty light, which shows bulls are hesitant and not fully stepping in yet. Without a real volume spike, any move above resistance risks turning into just another fake breakout. What would actually flip the script is a clean break above $144 with strong volume behind it. That kind of move would act like a trigger and could kick off the next leg higher. Cardano (ADA): $1 Back in Play After a Brutal Correction Cardano has taken a pretty hard hit lately, but it might be setting up for a bounce. Price is now drifting back toward an area where buyers have stepped in aggressively before, which could act as a base for a rebound. For ADA to really flip bullish, it needs to push above $0.36 and stay there. If that happens, the next hurdle is $0.38, a level it has already been rejected from twice in the past week. If ADA cannot break through, a dip back toward the $0.30 area is still on the table. The RSI is sitting around 40 and is not oversold yet, which means there is still room for downside in the short term. That said, as long as ADA holds above the previous low near $0.27, the bigger bullish setup stays intact going into the new year. Bitcoin Hyper Could Be the Real Christmas Eve Sleeper While most traders are checked out for the holidays and majors like XRP, SOL, and ADA grind through slow consolidations, Bitcoin Hyper is quietly doing the opposite and that is usually how early winners start. Bitcoin Hyper is built around one clear idea: giving Bitcoin real speed and utility without sacrificing security. It runs as a Bitcoin Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine. This means fast transactions, low fees, and full settlement back to Bitcoin. In a market where people are tired of bloated Layer 1 narratives, that combo is starting to stand out. The numbers back it up. Bitcoin Hyper has already raised over $29M, even with sentiment still shaky and volumes thin across the market. That kind of capital does not show up by accident, especially during the holidays when most investors are sitting on their hands. On top of that, staking rewards are sitting around 39% APY , which gives holders a reason to stay locked in rather than flip for short term noise. That is exactly how supply pressure quietly builds before bigger moves. When the market finally wakes up in the new year and risk appetite rotates back in, the projects that were accumulated during boring, low-volume phases tend to move first. While everyone waits for XRP to break $2.20, SOL to reclaim $144, or ADA to flip $0.36, Bitcoin Hyper is already positioning itself ahead of that rotation. Sometimes the best Christmas opportunity is the one no one is paying attention to yet.

Founders from both chains are reportedly teaming up to launch a new bridge that connects their ecosystems, a move that could redirect major trading volume toward Solana. For years, Solana and Cardano have battled for dominance as “Ethereum killers,” each taking a different approach. Solana is known for its blazing speed and low fees, while Cardano has focused on security and a careful, research-driven development process. Now, instead of competing for attention, the two may be aligning, and that shift toward collaboration could reshape the entire Layer 1 landscape. Time to get cooking https://t.co/jqMPw7R4Gl pic.twitter.com/jsjw4Tinfr — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 23, 2025 In a series of X posts, both Charles Hoskinson (Cardano’s founder) and Anatoly Yakovenko (Solana) agreed to start working on a bridge. This is a sign that the crypto space is maturing. Founders are recognizing that the next era of growth will come from building alliances through interoperability. This bridge could tap into the strengths of each network, allowing $SOL holders and users to take advantage of its privacy and security features. Meanwhile, Cardano’s users would benefit from getting access to a thriving DeFi market. Solana Price Prediction: SOL Needs to Move Above $125 to Reverse Its Downtrend Solana has broken below its long-held support at $127 and is now fighting to stay above $120, with trading activity and transaction volumes declining steadily over recent months. This bearish breakdown leaves SOL vulnerable to a deeper correction toward the $100 mark, a sharp contrast to just a few months ago when it was trading near $230. A move back above $125 would be a critical shift, potentially invalidating the current downtrend and opening the door to a short-term recovery. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests that SOL is consolidating. Interestingly, RSI has formed a mild bullish divergence, failing to make a lower low even as the price continued to fall, which could hint at a momentum shift. While Solana meme coins have been quiet this cycle, a new Ethereum-based project is starting to make noise. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has already raised over $4 million, bringing meme energy and community-driven trading culture back to the forefront with a fresh approach built around staking, challenges, and shared alpha.

However, newly emerging on-chain activity suggests the Dogecoin price prediction is split between bullish reversal and bearish continuation scenarios. $Doge /daily #Dogecoin has reached the previous symmetrical triangle breakdown target. It's now forming a new chart pattern and searching for a new trend. pic.twitter.com/uWq2WW90yi — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) December 26, 2025 Long-Term Holders Accumulate as Speculative Supply Contracts According to Glassnode data , Dogecoin speculative supply is contracting while longer-term holders display early accumulation signals. The 1-year to 2-year holder cohort has expanded its share of Dogecoin supply from approximately 21.84% to 22.34%. While the increase appears modest, the signal carries significance. Source: Glassnode These holders typically accumulate only when they believe downside risk is beginning to diminish. Network coin activity, measured via the spent coins metric, reinforces this perspective. The on-chain amount spent on coins has plummeted sharply. The spent coins age band metric dropped from roughly 251.97 million DOGE to about 94.34 million DOGE, representing a decline exceeding 60% in coin movement. Reduced coin activity potentially indicates fewer holders are rushing to transfer or liquidate tokens. Historically, similar activity declines have preceded short-term relief rallies in Dogecoin. Earlier in December, a comparable slowdown preceded a rally from near $0.132 to $0.151, a nearly 15% move within three days. Dogecoin Price Prediction: 4-Hour Chart Shows Defined Downtrend Structure The chart shows Dogecoin trading in a well-defined downtrend on the 4-hour timeframe, with price currently hovering around the $0.125 region. Market structure remains bearish, characterized by lower highs and lower lows, and price continues to trade below all highlighted resistance zones. The most immediate level to watch is the $0.12 area, which has been marked as a critical support. Source: TradingView This level is acting as a demand floor for now, but repeated tests weaken its strength, increasing the risk of a breakdown if sellers remain dominant. On the upside, the $0.14 zone stands out as an important resistance, aligning with prior consolidation and multiple rejection points. As long as Dogecoin remains below this level, upside attempts are likely to be corrective rather than trend-reversing. A more meaningful bullish confirmation would only emerge if price reclaims and holds above the broader $0.16 resistance band. Such a move would signal a shift in momentum and could open the door for a recovery toward $0.18 first and potentially $0.20–$0.21, which aligns with the higher target levels marked on the chart. Until then, rallies into resistance are likely to attract selling pressure. Momentum indicators reinforce the cautious outlook. The RSI is sitting near the low-40s, below the neutral 50 level, indicating weak momentum and a market that still favors sellers. While RSI is not deeply oversold, suggesting room for short-term bounces, it does not yet show the strength typically associated with trend reversals. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Presale Brings Solana’s Speed to Bitcoin for the First Time As Dogecoin eyes a breakout, its chances improve if Bitcoin starts climbing toward $100,000 again, especially with gold and stocks hitting new highs. In moments like this, early presales often see the biggest gains, and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is quickly becoming one to watch. Already nearing $30 million raised, the project is building the first true Layer 2 for Bitcoin powered by Solana tech, combining lightning-fast speed and low fees with Bitcoin’s unmatched security. It’s a bold move that could reshape how apps and users interact with the Bitcoin network. As more crypto wallets and exchanges begin adopting this technology, demand for $HYPER tokens is expected to increase substantially.

Price action has narrowed into a tight range, with neither buyers nor sellers able to assert clear control. As volatility compresses, apathy has become a defining feature of the current environment, and an increasing number of analysts are openly discussing the possibility that the market is transitioning toward a broader bear phase. Related Reading: XRP Exchange Reserves On Binance Fall To Six-Month Low: Selling Pressure Is Easing While price levels dominate headlines, on-chain data suggests the more important battle is unfolding beneath the surface. According to CryptoQuant analyst Burak Kesmeci, Bitcoin’s current positioning cannot be understood by price alone. Instead, attention is shifting toward the cost bases of key market participants, particularly whales and Binance spot users. Even with Bitcoin trading around $87,000, the most consequential level sits significantly higher. Data shows that the average cost basis of new whales, defined as holders with coins younger than 155 days, is clustered around $100,500. This zone represents a critical break-even threshold for large players who entered the market recently. As a result, every approach toward $100,000 carries heightened significance. That level may either trigger distribution, as whales seek to protect capital, or mark the start of renewed accumulation if confidence returns. Cost Basis Data Maps Bitcoin Real Support and Resistance The report highlights that beneath Bitcoin’s current price action, cost basis data offers a clearer framework for understanding market risk. For Binance spot users, the average cost basis sits near $56,000. This level represents the largest concentration of spot volume in the market and effectively defines the “deep water” zone if conditions deteriorate. In a prolonged bearish phase, $56K is where the bulk of spot holders would be tested, making it a critical long-term support area rather than a short-term trading level. Long-term whale positioning adds another important layer. The cost basis for whales holding Bitcoin longer than 155 days is clustered around $40,000. This means these participants are still sitting on profits of more than 2x, even after the recent correction. That profit cushion helps explain the rise in realized gains seen over recent weeks. For many long-term holders, current prices already represent a satisfactory exit, increasing the incentive to distribute into strength rather than aggressively accumulate. Taken together, the data reframes Bitcoin’s market structure. The key short-term ceiling remains near $100,000, where newer whales approach breakeven and supply tends to emerge. On the downside, $56,000 stands out as the level where spot market conviction would be most severely tested. Related Reading: Ethereum Bearish Structure Meets Bullish Supply Signal – What Happens Next Bitcoin Consolidates Above Key Weekly Support as Momentum Cools Bitcoin is trading near the $88,700 level on the weekly chart, stabilizing after a sharp pullback from the $120,000–$125,000 highs reached earlier this cycle. While the broader uptrend from 2024 remains intact, recent price action signals a clear slowdown in momentum. The market has shifted from an impulsive expansion phase into a corrective and consolidative structure, with volatility compressing around a critical support zone. Technically, Bitcoin is holding just above its rising medium-term moving average, which has acted as dynamic support throughout this bull cycle. The rejection above $110,000 marked a decisive loss of upside control, and the failure to quickly reclaim that zone suggests distribution rather than a brief pause. At the same time, price remains well above the long-term moving average, reinforcing that this move is still corrective within a larger trend, not yet a confirmed trend reversal. Related Reading: Bitcoin and Ethereum Coinbase Inflows Collapse While Binance Retains Relative Activity – Details Volume dynamics support this interpretation. Selling pressure expanded during the initial breakdown, but recent weeks show declining volume as price stabilizes between roughly $86,000 and $90,000. This points to seller exhaustion, though buyers have yet to step in with conviction. Structurally, the $86,000–$88,000 range is pivotal. Holding this zone keeps the higher-timeframe bullish structure alive. A clean breakdown would expose deeper downside. While a recovery above $95,000 would be needed to reassert bullish momentum and reopen the path toward prior highs.

This development sends shockwaves through the digital asset industry, highlighting persistent security vulnerabilities. Authorities accuse the individual of providing system access to hackers in exchange for cash payments. Consequently, this case raises critical questions about insider threats within cryptocurrency platforms. Coinbase Employee Arrested in Major Security Breach Indian law enforcement officials detained the Coinbase employee following an investigation into unauthorized access at the exchange. Bloomberg’s initial report indicates the arrest occurred in a major metropolitan area. The employee allegedly compromised internal systems. Furthermore, this incident represents one of the most significant insider threat cases in recent cryptocurrency history. Security experts immediately expressed concern about the implications for user funds and data protection. Coinbase confirmed it is cooperating fully with international authorities. The exchange emphasized its commitment to security protocols. However, this arrest follows a pattern of increasing cyber threats targeting cryptocurrency platforms. For instance, 2024 witnessed several high-profile exchange breaches globally. These incidents collectively resulted in millions of dollars in losses. Therefore, the industry faces mounting pressure to enhance internal controls. Cryptocurrency Exchange Hacking Trends and Patterns Insider threats represent approximately 30% of all security incidents in financial technology according to recent cybersecurity reports. The cryptocurrency sector proves particularly vulnerable due to its rapid growth and technical complexity. Moreover, exchanges manage billions in digital assets daily. This concentration of value attracts sophisticated criminal elements. Consequently, platforms must implement multi-layered security frameworks. Recent Major Exchange Security Incidents (2023-2024) Exchange Incident Type Estimated Loss Primary Vector Coinbase (2025) Insider Threat Under Investigation Employee Access Multiple Platforms (2024) Smart Contract Exploit $320 Million Code Vulnerability Asian Exchange (2023) Phishing Attack $45 Million Social Engineering Decentralized Exchange (2024) Bridge Hack $190 Million Protocol Weakness This table illustrates the diverse attack vectors threatening cryptocurrency exchanges. Insider threats remain especially difficult to detect and prevent. Traditional security measures often focus on external defenses. However, authorized personnel with malicious intent can bypass these protections. The Coinbase case demonstrates this vulnerability clearly. Security analysts now advocate for behavioral monitoring and zero-trust architectures. Expert Analysis of Insider Threat Management Cybersecurity specialists emphasize several critical measures for preventing insider threats. First, exchanges must implement strict access controls following the principle of least privilege. Second, continuous monitoring of employee activities provides early warning signs. Third, regular security audits identify potential vulnerabilities. Finally, comprehensive employee screening and ongoing training create a security-conscious culture. Blockchain forensic firms already assist in investigating the Coinbase incident. These companies specialize in tracing cryptocurrency transactions across public ledgers. Their techniques help identify fund movements following security breaches. Additionally, international law enforcement cooperation has improved significantly in recent years. This collaboration enables faster response to cross-border cryptocurrency crimes. India Crypto Security Incident and Regulatory Response India’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation has evolved considerably. The country implemented strict anti-money laundering rules for virtual digital assets in 2023. These regulations require exchanges to maintain detailed transaction records. Furthermore, Indian authorities now actively pursue cryptocurrency-related crimes. The arrest of the Coinbase employee demonstrates this increased vigilance. The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) likely participated in the investigation. This agency handles cybersecurity threats nationwide. Their involvement suggests the technical complexity of the case. Additionally, the Financial Intelligence Unit India monitors suspicious transactions. Their data possibly contributed to identifying the alleged insider threat. Enhanced Due Diligence: Exchanges now face pressure to strengthen employee screening processes. Technical Safeguards: Multi-signature wallets and transaction limits gain importance. International Cooperation: Cross-border investigations become standard practice. Insurance Coverage: Demand for cryptocurrency insurance products increases significantly. User Protection: Platforms emphasize security features like withdrawal whitelists. These developments reflect the industry’s response to security challenges. However, balancing security with usability remains difficult. Excessive controls can hinder legitimate user activities. Therefore, exchanges must find optimal security configurations. The Coinbase incident will undoubtedly influence industry standards globally. Broader Implications for Exchange Security Protocols The alleged insider threat at Coinbase affects the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Investors naturally question the safety of their assets on centralized platforms. Consequently, exchanges face renewed scrutiny of their security practices. Regulatory bodies may introduce stricter requirements for personnel management. Additionally, insurance providers could adjust their coverage terms and premiums. Decentralized exchanges might benefit from increased user adoption following this incident. These platforms eliminate central points of failure by design. However, they present different security challenges including smart contract risks. Therefore, no perfect solution exists currently. The industry continues developing hybrid approaches combining centralized and decentralized elements. Security researchers emphasize several emerging technologies for preventing insider threats. Artificial intelligence systems can analyze employee behavior patterns. Blockchain-based access logs create immutable audit trails. Biometric authentication adds another security layer. These technologies collectively reduce but cannot eliminate risks entirely. Human factors remain the most unpredictable element in security equations. Conclusion The Coinbase employee arrested in India represents a significant moment for cryptocurrency security. This incident highlights the persistent threat of insider attacks within digital asset exchanges. The industry must address this vulnerability through technological and procedural improvements. International cooperation between regulators and law enforcement proves essential for investigating such cases. Ultimately, security remains the foundation for mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. Exchanges that demonstrate robust protection mechanisms will maintain user trust despite these challenges. FAQs Q1: What exactly did the Coinbase employee allegedly do?

This clarification, issued from Zug, Switzerland, on March 15, 2025, directly addresses community concerns that emerged following the rejection of a high-stakes proposal for the Aave DAO to absorb Aave Labs. The situation underscores the persistent tension between founder vision and community-led governance in the maturing DeFi sector. Aave Governance Faces Scrutiny After Major Token Acquisition The controversy centers on a significant transaction executed by Kulechov. Blockchain analytics firms publicly recorded the purchase of a substantial amount of AAVE tokens, worth approximately $15 million, from the open market. Consequently, this transaction occurred during a sensitive period for the Aave decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Specifically, the community was actively debating Proposal AIP-121, which sought to formalize and fund a renewed scope of work for Aave Labs, the protocol’s primary development team, by having the DAO absorb it. The proposal ultimately failed to reach the required consensus threshold. Following the proposal’s rejection, some community members expressed apprehension. They questioned whether the founder’s large-scale token acquisition could potentially sway future governance votes, undermining the decentralized ethos of the protocol. In response, Kulechov provided a clear statement to several crypto news outlets. He confirmed the factual nature of the purchase but emphasized a critical distinction: he did not utilize these newly acquired tokens in any governance voting related to the proposal. “My commitment has always been to the protocol’s long-term health, not to centralizing decision-making power,” Kulechov stated. Understanding the Mechanics of Aave’s Decentralized Governance To fully grasp the implications, one must understand how Aave governance operates. The Aave DAO uses a token-based voting system where one AAVE token typically equals one vote. Holders can delegate their voting power to representatives or vote directly on proposals that dictate the protocol’s future, including: Parameter adjustments: Changes to interest rates, collateral factors, and asset listings. Treasury management: Decisions on fund allocation from the community treasury. Strategic partnerships: Approvals for integrations and ecosystem expansions. Developer funding: Proposals like AIP-121 to resource core development teams. Therefore, large token acquisitions by influential figures naturally attract scrutiny. The system’s integrity relies on the assumption that voting power is distributed and not susceptible to undue concentration. Aave’s governance dashboard shows that voting power is distributed among thousands of addresses, but a subset of large holders, often called “whales,” can exert significant influence. The Delicate Balance Between Founders and DAOs This event is not isolated in the DeFi landscape. Experts point to a recurring pattern where founding teams and DAOs navigate a complex relationship. “The transition from founder-led startup to community-owned protocol is the most challenging phase in DeFi,” notes Dr. Elena Torres, a researcher at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. “Founders retain deep expertise and vision, but the community rightly guards against centralization. Transparent communication, as seen here, is essential for maintaining trust.” The table below contrasts typical founder motivations with community concerns in such scenarios: Potential Founder Motivation Common Community Concern Signal long-term belief in the protocol Attempt to control governance outcomes Personal financial investment strategy Creation of a centralized decision-making point Align incentives with token holders Reduction of the protocol’s censorship resistance Historical Context and Precedents in DeFi Governance The Aave situation echoes past debates within other major protocols. For instance, the Uniswap DAO has repeatedly discussed the role of Uniswap Labs and its founders. Similarly, Compound Finance has seen proposals that adjust the balance of power between its founding team and COMP token holders. These precedents show a sector-wide evolution. Initially, many protocols launched with significant founder and venture capital allocations. Over time, successful protocols work to decentralize this control through community grants, broad token distributions, and transparent governance processes. In Aave’s case, the protocol has historically demonstrated a strong commitment to decentralization. The Aave DAO controls a treasury worth billions of dollars and has successfully passed numerous proposals without major controversy. The reaction to Kulechov’s purchase, therefore, reflects the community’s vigilance rather than a systemic failure. It highlights an advanced stage of governance maturity where participants actively police potential conflicts of interest. Market Impact and Protocol Performance Metrics Analyzing the market response provides further context. Following the news of both the proposal rejection and the clarification, the AAVE token price showed short-term volatility but quickly stabilized. More importantly, key protocol health metrics remained robust. According to data from DeFiLlama, Aave’s total value locked (TVL) across its V2 and V3 deployments has held steady above $12 billion. Furthermore, the protocol continues to generate significant revenue from borrowing fees, indicating that user activity and trust in the underlying lending markets were not materially affected by the governance discussion. This resilience suggests that the market distinguishes between governance debates and fundamental protocol utility. “Sophisticated participants understand that public disputes over governance are a feature, not a bug, of a healthy DAO,” says Marcus Chen, a partner at a crypto-focused hedge fund. “It shows the system is working. The real risk is apathy, not debate.” The Path Forward for Transparent DeFi Governance This episode offers several lessons for the broader decentralized finance ecosystem. First, it underscores the need for clear communication from key stakeholders during sensitive governance periods. Kulechov’s prompt clarification helped mitigate uncertainty. Second, it highlights potential areas for governance model innovation. Some communities are experimenting with: Time-locked governance tokens: Vesting schedules that prevent immediate voting use after purchase. Reputation-based systems: Supplementing token voting with non-financial reputation scores. Improved transparency dashboards: Real-time tools that track voting power concentration and delegate activity. For Aave specifically, the path forward likely involves continued dialogue. The DAO may revisit aspects of its working relationship with Aave Labs in a new proposal. The community’s demonstrated engagement is a positive sign for the protocol’s decentralized future. Conclusion The clarification from Aave founder Stani Kulechov regarding his $15 million AAVE token purchase has served as a critical stress test for the protocol’s governance framework. While the transaction raised valid questions about potential influence, the subsequent public discourse and the founder’s transparency have ultimately reinforced the robustness of community-led oversight. This event exemplifies the maturing nature of Aave governance , where vigilance, communication, and a commitment to decentralized principles help navigate complex situations. As DeFi continues to evolve, such transparent resolutions set a vital precedent for balancing founder expertise with the immutable requirement for decentralized control. FAQs Q1: What was the Aave DAO proposal that was rejected? The rejected proposal, AIP-121, sought for the Aave DAO to formally absorb and fund Aave Labs, the protocol’s primary development team, with a renewed scope of work and budget. It did not achieve the necessary consensus to pass. Q2: Did Stani Kulechov use the newly purchased tokens to vote? No. Kulechov explicitly clarified that while the $15 million token purchase was factual, he did not use those specific tokens to participate in governance voting on the AIP-121 proposal or any other recent measures. Q3: Why do large token purchases by founders concern DeFi communities? Large purchases can concentrate voting power, potentially allowing a single entity to unduly influence the direction of a supposedly decentralized protocol. This conflicts with the core DeFi principles of censorship resistance and distributed control. Q4: How did the AAVE token and protocol performance react to this news? The AAVE token experienced short-term volatility but quickly stabilized. More importantly, fundamental protocol metrics like Total Value Locked (TVL) and revenue generation remained strong, indicating underlying user trust was not damaged. Q5: What does this event mean for the future of Aave governance? The event demonstrates an actively engaged community and may lead to discussions about governance model improvements, such as time-locks on voting power for newly acquired tokens. It reinforces that transparent communication is essential for maintaining trust in a DAO.

China has announced new regulations that will make it significantly easier for commercial rocket companies developing reusable launch technology to access public capital markets. New requirements to list on the STAR marke t T he Shanghai Stock Exchange revealed on Friday that firms working on reusable rockets can now bypass standard financial requirements like profitability limits and minimum revenue requirements when listing on the tech-focused STAR market. These firms will instead be required to demonstrate that they have achieved at least one successful orbital launch using their reusable rocket technology. The United States currently dominates the reusable rocket sector, with SpaceX’s Falcon 9 being the only regularly operational reusable rocket system that routinely delivers satellites into orbit. Earlier in December, LandSpace, China’s leading private rocket manufacturer, conducted the country’s first full test of a reusable rocket with its new Zhuque-3 model. The launch successfully placed a satellite into orbit using reusable rocket technology, but the mission did not complete the critical step of recovering the rocket’s first-stage booster. China’s commercial space ambitions and national security priorities were not helped much by the half-full, half-empty outcome of the mission. China aims to deploy tens of thousands of satellites into low-Earth orbit within the coming decades, creating a large network of constellations that would rival or exceed SpaceX’s Starlink network . The country’s officials believe that SpaceX’s dominant position in the industry is a national security concern. The country is actively deploying two major satellite megaconstellations including the Guowang network, which is managed by state-owned China Satellite Network Group and plans to deploy up to 13,000 satellites. The networ k al ready launched over 100 satellites as of November 2025. The Qianfan constellation, backed by Shanghai’s municipal government, aims to deploy approximately 15,000 satellites by 2030 and has launched around 90 satellites to date. Starlink currently has 6,800 active satellites. Is the new regulation necessary? LandSpace has stated publicly that it will need access to China’s capital markets to remain competitive with SpaceX. Similar to other high-tech sectors where companies require massive upfront investment before generating profits by removing profitability and revenue barriers, the Shanghai Stock Exchange is giving rocket companies the opportunity to raise substantial funds from public investors, even while their products remain in development stages. LandSpace received 900 million yuan ($123 million) from China’s National Manufacturing Transformation and Upgrading Fund in December 2024. The company filed preliminary documents with Chinese regulators in late July, and could launch an initial public offering in early 2026. The Shanghai Stock Exchange previously changed its regulations in June to make it easier for pre-profit innovative companies to list on the STAR market . The new guidelines also prioritize companies that take up national missions or participate in major state-led space projects. LandSpace has announced plans to attempt a complete rocket recovery in mid-2026 during the second launch of its Zhuque-3 system. Aside from LandSpace, other Chinese state-owned enterprises and private companies are now rushing to test their own reusable rocket designs, with access to the capital needed for rapid development and scaling.

This move signals a profound shift in the Bitcoin mining ecosystem as operators globally confront shrinking profit margins. The company’s decision affects its entire product lineup, including the popular Antminer S19 and newer S21 series. Consequently, industry analysts view this development as a critical indicator of broader market pressures. Bitmain Mining Rigs Discount: Analyzing the Immediate Catalyst Bitmain’s discount announcement follows a sustained period of declining mining profitability. According to industry data from Cointelegraph, the current hash rate price has fallen below the minimum operational threshold for many mining operations. This metric represents the revenue generated per unit of computational power. Therefore, miners face difficult decisions about equipment upgrades and operational scaling. The company now offers significant price reductions across most inventory. Additionally, Bitmain has implemented an auction-based sales model for select products. This approach contrasts sharply with the fixed pricing typically maintained during bull markets. Historically, mining hardware manufacturers maintain stable pricing during industry expansions. However, the current market conditions necessitate aggressive inventory management. The Bitcoin network’s hash rate continues reaching new highs. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin price has remained relatively stagnant against rising energy costs. Consequently, mining efficiency becomes the paramount concern for operators. Bitmain’s response reflects these harsh economic realities. The company aims to stimulate demand during a cyclical downturn. Furthermore, this strategy helps clear existing inventory before next-generation hardware releases. Understanding the Mining Profitability Equation Bitcoin mining profitability depends on several interconnected variables. Operators must constantly calculate their break-even points. Key factors include electricity costs, hardware efficiency, network difficulty, and Bitcoin’s market price. Recently, the global average electricity price for miners has increased by approximately 18%. Simultaneously, the network difficulty has surged by over 40% in the past year. These combined pressures squeeze operator margins dramatically. The hash price metric provides the clearest profitability indicator. This value represents the expected daily revenue from one terahash per second of mining power. Currently, this figure sits near multi-year lows. The following table illustrates the changing economics for a standard mining operation: Metric 2023 Average 2025 Current Change Hash Price (USD/TH/s/day) $0.085 $0.052 -38.8% Network Difficulty 52.3T 86.7T +65.8% Global Avg. Electricity Cost (USD/kWh) $0.045 $0.053 +17.8% S19 XP Hydro Profitability (Est.) $12.50/day $4.20/day -66.4% These numbers explain the urgent need for hardware efficiency improvements. Newer mining rigs like the S21 series offer better joules per terahash ratios. However, their upfront cost previously created prohibitive capital expenditure requirements. Bitmain’s discounts directly address this barrier. The company effectively lowers the entry point for efficiency upgrades. Moreover, this move may accelerate the retirement of older, less efficient hardware globally. Such transitions typically benefit network sustainability long-term. Industry Expert Perspectives on the Strategic Shift Industry analysts interpret Bitmain’s actions through multiple lenses. Some experts view the discounts as a routine inventory cycle management tactic. Others see a strategic response to increased competition from emerging manufacturers. Companies like MicroBT and Canaan have gained market share recently. Consequently, Bitmain must defend its dominant position aggressively. The auction model introduction represents another significant development. This mechanism allows market forces to determine fair value dynamically. It also provides Bitmain with real-time demand data for production planning. Mining pool operators report increased interest in hardware upgrades following the announcement. However, they caution that discounted hardware alone cannot solve profitability challenges. Operators must secure low-cost, reliable power contracts. They must also navigate complex regulatory environments. Regions like Texas and Kazakhstan have become major mining hubs. These locations offer favorable conditions but face infrastructure and policy uncertainties. Therefore, hardware acquisition represents just one component of a successful mining strategy. The current downturn may trigger industry consolidation. Smaller operations may merge or seek acquisition by larger, better-capitalized entities. Historical Context and Market Cycle Patterns The cryptocurrency mining industry experiences pronounced cyclicality. Periods of explosive growth often follow technological breakthroughs or major Bitcoin price rallies. Conversely, extended bear markets test operator resilience and efficiency. The current situation mirrors previous downturns in 2018-2019 and 2022. During those periods, hardware manufacturers similarly offered promotions and adjusted sales tactics. However, the scale of Bitmain’s current discounting appears more comprehensive. The inclusion of flagship models like the S19 series demonstrates particular urgency. This series has represented the industry workhorse for several years. Previous cycles show that strategic hardware acquisitions during downturns can yield significant advantages. Operators who upgrade equipment during low-price periods position themselves optimally for the next expansion. Their lower capital costs translate into faster return on investment when conditions improve. Furthermore, efficient hardware provides operational flexibility during volatile energy price periods. The current discount window may therefore create a strategic buying opportunity for well-capitalized miners. However, timing the market cycle bottom remains challenging. Industry veterans emphasize focusing on long-term fundamentals rather than short-term price movements. Key considerations for operators evaluating Bitmain’s discounted rigs include: Total Cost of Ownership: Calculate purchase price plus estimated energy and maintenance costs. Hash Rate Efficiency: Compare joules per terahash across available models. Reliability and Warranty: Verify service terms and manufacturer support. Future-Proofing: Assess hardware lifespan against anticipated network difficulty increases. Resale Value: Consider secondary market demand for the specific model. Global Impact and Regional Variations Bitmain’s pricing strategy affects mining operations differently across regions. Areas with very low electricity costs, like certain parts of Latin America and the Middle East, may find the discounts particularly compelling. Their operational break-even points are lower, making efficiency upgrades more immediately profitable. Conversely, regions with high energy costs require more careful calculation. European miners, facing energy prices above $0.15/kWh in some areas, need extreme efficiency to remain viable. For them, even discounted hardware may not solve fundamental profitability issues. The discount announcement coincides with shifting geopolitical landscapes for mining. The United States has emerged as the dominant mining hub following China’s 2021 mining ban. American operators now control approximately 40% of the global hash rate. This concentration creates both opportunities and vulnerabilities. Bitmain’s discounts could further consolidate mining power among large, institutional American operators. These entities often have better access to capital and energy contracts. Meanwhile, smaller, decentralized mining operations face increasing competitive pressure. The industry’s evolving structure raises important questions about network decentralization and security. Technological Innovation and Future Hardware Developments Bitmain’s aggressive discounting may also signal impending technological transitions. The company typically reduces prices on current-generation hardware before launching new models. Industry rumors suggest next-generation 3-nanometer chip technology could arrive within 12-18 months. These chips promise another significant leap in energy efficiency. Consequently, miners must weigh discounted current technology against future advancements. Purchasing today’s hardware at lower prices makes sense if the equipment can generate positive returns before becoming obsolete. This calculation depends heavily on Bitcoin price projections and network difficulty forecasts. Manufacturers constantly balance innovation cycles with market demand. The current profitability crisis may accelerate research and development timelines. Companies need to deliver more efficient solutions to restore healthy industry margins. Beyond hardware efficiency, miners explore alternative energy sources and cooling solutions. Some operations now utilize stranded natural gas or integrate with renewable energy grids. Others implement immersion cooling technology to improve hardware longevity and performance. These innovations complement hardware advancements in the pursuit of sustainable profitability. Conclusion Bitmain’s decision to offer major discounts on mining rigs reflects deep structural challenges within the Bitcoin mining industry. The hash rate price decline below minimum profit margins has forced strategic adjustments across the ecosystem. While discounted hardware provides temporary relief for some operators, long-term solutions require broader efficiency improvements and favorable market conditions. The shift to auction-based sales models indicates a more dynamic, market-responsive approach from manufacturers. Ultimately, this period of consolidation and adjustment may strengthen the industry’s foundation. More efficient operations will emerge from this downturn, potentially benefiting the entire Bitcoin network through enhanced security and sustainability. The Bitmain mining rigs discount serves as a clear market signal, highlighting both current pressures and future transformation pathways. FAQs Q1: Why is Bitmain offering discounts on mining rigs now? Bitmain offers discounts primarily due to declining Bitcoin mining profitability. The hash rate price has fallen below many operators’ break-even points, reducing demand for new hardware. Additionally, the company likely aims to clear inventory before introducing next-generation models. Q2: Which Bitmain mining rig models are included in the discount? The discounts apply to most current products, including the widely used Antminer S19 series and the newer, more efficient S21 series. Bitmain has also moved some inventory to an auction-based sales model for dynamic pricing. Q3: How does the current mining profitability crisis affect small-scale miners? Small-scale miners face particular challenges as profit margins shrink. They often lack the capital for efficiency upgrades and may struggle with higher relative energy costs. Some may pause operations or sell equipment during this downturn. Q4: Could these discounts indicate a buying opportunity for new miners? Potentially, yes. Discounted efficient hardware lowers the entry barrier. However, new miners must carefully calculate total costs, including electricity and maintenance, against projected Bitcoin revenue. Success requires access to low-cost power and sound operational planning. Q5: What long-term impacts might this industry downturn have? The downturn will likely accelerate industry consolidation, with larger, more efficient operations gaining market share. It may also spur faster technological innovation as manufacturers compete on efficiency. Ultimately, a leaner, more resilient mining industry could emerge from this period.

The deal surfaced two days ago and landed quietly, as Cryptopolitan reported . No press release showed up. No regulatory filing followed. The only public confirmation we got later on came from a 90-word Groq blog post published after markets closed early for the holiday. Analyst Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein said that Nvidia is now so large it can close a $20 billion agreement on Christmas Eve and the market barely reacts, because really, stocks pretended not to see what’s gong on. Deal structure pulls Groq leaders and assets without a formal takeover CNBC reported that Nvidia agreed to buy selected Groq assets for $20 billion in cash, based on details shared by lead investor Alex Davis. Davis runs Disruptive and said his firm invested more than $500 million into Groq. Disruptive also led the company’s most recent funding round in September, which valued the startup at $6.9 billion. Groq said its founder and chief executive Jonathan Ross, company president Sunny Madra, and several senior leaders will join Nvidia to help scale the licensed technology. The post also stated that Groq will keep operating as an independent business. Simon Edwards, the company’s finance chief, will lead what remains of the firm. If this had been a clean acquisition, it would have been the largest in Nvidia’s 32-year history. The company’s biggest past deal was the 2019 Mellanox purchase, which came in just under $7 billion. This time, the structure looks different by design. The agreement is labeled a non-exclusive license, not a takeover. That setup follows a recent pattern across Big Tech. Companies are spending billions to bring in AI talent and hardware knowledge without triggering full merger reviews. Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have all used similar approaches. Nvidia used the same playbook in September when it paid more than $900 million to hire Enfabrica CEO Rochan Sankar and staff while licensing that startup’s technology. Cryptopolitan has analyzed that this format helps deals close faster, while also limiting direct antitrust exposure. Per data from Yahoo Finance, NVDA surged by 1.3% on Friday’s closing bell at $190.53, and the stock is up 42% this year and has climbed more than 13x since the end of 2022 when OpenAI first released ChatGPT. According to Nvidia’s last earnings report in Q3 2025, the most valuable company on earth holds $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, which is massively up from the $13.3 billion it had just 2 and a half years ago in Q3 2023. Nvidia is playing it smart with Groq deal; offense and defense Groq was founded in 2016 by former engineers, including Ross, who helped create Google’s tensor processing units, or TPUs, which some firms use instead of graphics processors. Groq focuses on inference, where AI models respond to new data. Nvidia controls most of the training side, where models learn from massive data sets. Cantor analysts said the deal lets Nvidia play offense and defense at the same time, writing that pulling Groq assets in-house prevents rivals from gaining access. The Howard Lutnick-owned company kept its buy rating and raised its price target to $300. BofA also kept a buy rating on NVDA with a $275 target, describing the Groq deal as surprising, expensive, and strategic. They also said that GPU dominance in training does not guarantee control of inference, which may need more specialized chips. Questions remain unresolved. Analysts asked who owns Groq’s language processing unit intellectual property. They also questioned whether that technology can be licensed to competitors and whether Groq’s remaining cloud business could undercut pricing tied to Nvidia’s LPU services. The next chance for public comments will likely come on Jan. 5, when Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks at CES in Las Vegas. Meanwhile, these Magnificent 7 stocks are up 27% year-to-date, following gains of 107% in 2023 and 67% in 2024. Since early 2023, their shares are up 338% and drove 45% of the S&P 500’s 18% return this year. Their combined value now sits at $21 trillion, or 34% of the index, per data from S&P Global’s Dow Jones Industrial.

He now credits the so-called “XRP Army” with playing a key role in keeping the token afloat through years of volatility, showing just how powerful a loyal holder base can be. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Needs to Bounce From $1.80 to Target $3 XRP has shed 10% of its value this year, which makes it the 4 th worst-performing token in the top 5. However, in the past 7 days, the token has recovered slightly, posting gains of 0.5% during this period. Meanwhile, trading volumes have increased by 30% in the past 24 hours, and currently account for less than 2% of the asset’s circulating market cap. Source: TradingView Once again, XRP has found strong support at $1.80. This price zone has acted as a strong bouncing pad four times already in the past. Meanwhile, a descending triangle has formed as a result of the latest price action. This is a price compression pattern that tends to precede a big breakout. If the price rises above $2.20, this would invalidate the token’s bearish price structure, and a bullish breakout of the triangle pattern would be confirmed. XRP might be eyeing $3 in the near term, especially with big names like Michael Novogratz giving credibility to its long-term vision. But if you’re looking for the next breakout opportunity, a new project is quietly turning heads.

The mess is tied to the Federal Reserve’s shrinking bond portfolio, a tightening plan that’s been in play since mid‑2022. And yes, it’s breaking things. The failed trades involved the most recently issued 10-year Treasury note. That specific batch came from a $42 billion auction held on November 12. The interest rates for lending that security collapsed so badly that some holders agreed to lend it at negative rates, meaning they gave it away cheaper than they got it back. In this type of repo transaction, settlement fails are almost guaranteed. That’s exactly what happened. Fed added less supply to the market in recent auctions Ahead of a Dec. 15 reopening of that same note, traders expected more supply to ease the pressure. That didn’t happen. Instead of the usual market relief, the reopening saw a sharp shortage. This wasn’t the regular “special” rate situation you sometimes see in repurchase agreements. This time, it was worse. And the blame goes to the Federal Reserve again. At that November auction, the Fed only took $6.5 billion worth of the notes for its own books. That’s a lot less than usual. In February, the Fed had added $11.5 billion to a similar-sized sale. In May, it took $14.8 billion, and in August, $14.3 billion. So, what changed? Here’s what changed: the Fed’s maturing Treasury holdings dropped sharply. Their System Open Market Account (SOMA) had just $22 billion maturing on Nov. 15, compared to $45 to $49 billion maturing in previous cycles. And since the Fed only reinvests maturing Treasuries above a certain cap, the amount they rolled over fell too. That cap has changed over time. Back in June 2022, the monthly cap was $30 billion. By September, it doubled to $60 billion. That tightening move directly impacted how much of each auction the Fed could touch. As a result, they didn’t step in to support the November 10-year note the way they had earlier this year. Same thing happened with three-year notes, by the way — smaller add-ons there too. This left traders scrambling to borrow a note that wasn’t widely available. Which meant more failed settlements, more headaches, and yeah, $30.5 billion worth of broken trades in just one week. Yields across Treasury curve change after holiday and strong economic data Markets came back online after the Christmas holiday, and the 10-year Treasury yield barely moved. It fell by less than one basis point, landing at 4.13%. The 2-year yield dropped over 2 basis points, ending at 3.483%. One basis point equals 0.01%, and in the bond world, yields move opposite to prices. The Treasury curve saw these changes on Friday: 1-month: 3.619% (+0.006) 3-month: 3.633% (-0.011) 6-month: 3.585% (-0.014) 1-year: 3.49% (-0.016) 2-year: 3.481% (-0.029) 10-year: 4.13% (-0.004) 30-year: 4.816% (+0.021) The moves came as traders processed fresh economic numbers. The Labor Department said jobless claims fell to 214,000 for the week ending December 20, down 10,000 from the week before. It came in below forecasts. And on top of that, the Commerce Department reported the U.S. economy grew 4.3% in Q1, marking the fastest pace in two years. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Putin Claims US Interest,https://bitcoinist.com/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-crypto-mining-putin-us/,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly said that the United States is interested in using Zaporizhzhia’s nuclear electricity for crypto mining. US & Russia Are In Talks About Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant Russia and the US are negotiating joint control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, according to a report from Kyiv Post , citing Russian business newspaper Kommersant. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is located in Southeastern Ukraine and is the largest nuclear energy facility in Europe. It used to be responsible for more than a fifth of the electricity in Ukraine, but in 2022, Russian forces captured it, and it has since ceased power generation. It would now appear that discussions have emerged about the future use of the power plant. As per the report, Vladimir Putin said at a meeting with major business figures on Christmas Eve that the US is interested in using the plant’s electricity for crypto mining and for supplying power to Ukraine. Crypto mining, the most prominent example of which is Bitcoin mining , can be an energy-intensive process, leveraging computing power to solve mathematical puzzles that allow the operator to have a chance at adding the next block to the blockchain. Crypto mining has features like portability and modularity that have made many consider its application in using waste or excess energy in power grids to produce value in the form of digital assets . On a global scale, Bitcoin mining has seen some rapid expansion during the past three years, with the Hashrate , a measure of the network’s total computing power, expanding by almost five times. Restarting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant for crypto mining, or any other purpose, however, wouldn’t be a simple task. By late 2022, all six reactors of the plant were shut down, with five of them being put in a state of cold shutdown. One reactor was kept in hot shutdown to produce steam for nuclear safety purposes. Even so, the plant isn’t in a state where a restart is possible, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). As the IAEA wrote in a press release earlier this year: Nuclear safety remains precarious at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) and its six reactors cannot be restarted as long as the military conflict continues to jeopardize the situation at the site, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi told IAEA Member States this week. Given this context, it only remains to be seen whether any reported negotiations around the nuclear power plant will actually lead it to be used for any energy-related purpose, crypto mining or otherwise.

His argument draws from the current condition of Japan’s currency environment, its longstanding collaboration with Ripple, and the need for faster cross-border payment systems in the Asian region. Japan has been navigating persistent volatility in the yen and shifts in monetary policy, which White believes could push financial institutions to seek faster settlement options. In situations where capital moves quickly, systems that reduce settlement time may prove beneficial. XRP, he said, fits this requirement due to its ability to settle transfers instantly without requiring pre-funded liquidity pools. Why Japan Could Become $XRP First Full-Scale Use Case When FX volatility spikes and the yen cracks, institutions don’t wait, they move capital fast. That’s where XRP fits in. Instant liquidity, real-time FX, and cross-border flow without pre-funding. Japan’s largest… pic.twitter.com/xgMXM4DIfR — Paul White Gold Eagle (@PaulGoldEagle) December 22, 2025 Japan’s Position in the XRP Discussion Japan stands out in the XRP adoption conversation largely because of its existing ties with Ripple through SBI Holdings . This partnership history means Japanese banks and remittance firms are likely to adopt XRP-based systems faster than others, since they’ve already worked together. White emphasized that the focus should extend beyond market price discussions and include FX stress, liquidity demands, and geopolitical influence. Japan plays a central role in capital movement across Asia, meaning inefficiencies in its currency pipeline can have wider effects. Under such circumstances, a blockchain settlement asset may serve as a neutral channel for international transfers without interfering with monetary policy. Evidence of interest already exists. In September 2023, SBI announced plans to utilize XRP for overseas fund transfers across four Asian countries, highlighting early progress in practical application rather than speculation. To evaluate the potential financial effect if Japan adopts XRP extensively, several pricing possibilities can be outlined using current market data. XRP trades around $1.87 at the time of writing. With this as a reference point, three adoption-based valuation paths are frequently discussed in industry circles. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Base Projection: $3 to $5 Range In a gradual adoption environment where financial institutions integrate XRP mainly for remittances and PHP/JPY settlements, steady usage could influence price appreciation without a supply shortage. This case assumes incremental growth and shared use with other settlement assets rather than singular dominance. Analysts at 24/7 Wall St previously forecast a price window of $3 to $4.5, citing Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD expansion in Japan as a contributing factor. Moderate Projection: $8 to $12 Range Under a scenario where Japanese corporations and banks choose XRP as their primary settlement mechanism, demand could strengthen. Corporate liquidity flows are significantly larger than those through retail remittance channels, suggesting that increased institutional participation may attract more long-term investors. In such a development, analysts consider a move toward double-digit pricing reasonable. High Projection: $15 and Above A more ambitious path assumes Japan’s usage model becomes a benchmark for neighboring markets, encouraging broader Asian integration. To support this outcome, regulatory clarity, deep liquidity reserves, and high-frequency transactional demand would be necessary. Although this is a less conservative assumption, advocates believe regional adoption could reflect structural valuation growth over time. The central takeaway is that future performance for XRP depends primarily on operational deployment rather than short-term speculation. Japan offers a distinct landscape due to its progressive stance on crypto regulation, its economic scale, and existing collaborations with Ripple. Should institutional adoption expand, XRP could transition from a speculative digital asset to a functional element within financial infrastructure. However, these scenarios remain projections rather than confirmed outcomes. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Bitcoin Supply Overhang Could Dictate Volatility & Selling Pressure As pointed out by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, over 6.6 million BTC is being held above the latest spot price of the cryptocurrency. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the “Supply In Loss,” which measures, as its name suggests, the total amount of Bitcoin that’s currently carrying some net unrealized loss. Related Reading: Bitcoin Extreme Fear Streak Extends To 13 Days On Christmas The metric works by going through the transaction history of each token in circulation to determine the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. If this previous transfer price was more than the current spot price for any coin, then that particular token is considered to be in a state of loss. The Supply In Loss adds up all coins fulfilling this condition to find the total situation on the network. A counterpart indicator called the Supply In Profit accounts for the supply of the opposite type. Now, here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Supply In Loss over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Supply In Loss shrunk to a value of zero as the asset’s price set its all-time high (ATH) above $126,000 back in October, but with the market downturn that has followed since then, the indicator’s value has shot up. Today, around 6.6 million tokens of the cryptocurrency sit below cost basis, equivalent to a third of the BTC supply in circulation. The recent highs in the Supply In Loss represent the highest degree of pain in the market since 2023. In another X post, the analyst has shared the chart for another Bitcoin indicator, this one called the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD). The URPD contains information about how much BTC was bought last at each of the levels that the asset has visited in its history. Looks like a significant portion of the supply sits above the spot price | Source: @JA_Maartun on X From the chart of the URPD, it’s visible how the Bitcoin supply that’s in loss is distributed across the various levels right now. A few levels are particularly prominent in the degree of supply that they carry, while some others are notably thin with coins. Generally, investors who are in loss look forward to a retest of their cost basis so that they can get their money “back.” Once this happens, some of these hands decide to exit, fearing that BTC will go down again in the near future. This selling can make large supply clusters above the spot price, potential points of volatility.

This dramatic divergence in institutional strategy, reported by blockchain analytics firm Onchainlens in March 2025, reveals critical insights into the evolving landscape of proof-of-stake validation and corporate crypto treasury management. The contrasting moves by these two significant players highlight the complex risk-reward calculations now dominating institutional cryptocurrency investment decisions. Bitmain’s Major Ethereum Staking Move Analyzed Bitmain’s decision to stake 74,880 ETH represents one of the largest single institutional commitments to Ethereum staking since The Merge transitioned the network to proof-of-stake consensus. The Beijing-based company, historically dominant in Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturing, began accumulating this substantial position over several months according to on-chain data analysis. This strategic pivot toward Ethereum validation signals a fundamental diversification beyond their traditional proof-of-work expertise. Furthermore, the timing coincides with broader institutional adoption trends in cryptocurrency staking products. Industry analysts immediately noted several key implications from Bitmain’s move. First, the commitment demonstrates substantial confidence in Ethereum’s long-term network security and economic model. Second, the scale suggests sophisticated treasury management strategies are becoming standard among crypto-native corporations. Third, the accumulation period indicates deliberate, price-conscious acquisition rather than speculative timing. Blockchain data reveals the ETH was sourced from multiple exchanges and private wallets, suggesting a coordinated accumulation strategy designed to minimize market impact. The Technical Mechanics of Large-Scale Staking Executing a stake of this magnitude requires significant technical infrastructure. Each Ethereum validator requires a 32 ETH deposit, meaning Bitmain’s position represents approximately 2,340 individual validator nodes. Managing this validator fleet demands robust server infrastructure, sophisticated monitoring systems, and dedicated technical personnel. The company likely utilizes either enterprise-grade staking services or has developed proprietary validation infrastructure. This operational commitment underscores the professionalization of institutional staking, moving far beyond retail participation through simple exchange interfaces. Shapelink’s Simultaneous $100 Million ETH Unstaking While Bitmain entered the staking arena, blockchain infrastructure provider Shapelink initiated the unstaking of 35,627 ETH valued at approximately $100 million. This substantial withdrawal represents a significant reduction in their Ethereum network participation. On-chain analysis indicates the unstaking process occurred through multiple transactions over a 48-hour period, suggesting planned treasury reallocation rather than emergency liquidity needs. The company, known for providing node infrastructure services across multiple blockchain networks, has not publicly commented on the strategic rationale behind this move. Market observers have proposed several plausible explanations for Shapelink’s decision. Some analysts suggest portfolio rebalancing toward other blockchain investments or traditional assets. Others speculate about potential strategic shifts in their business model away from infrastructure provision. The unstaking coincides with the full unlocking period post-Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade, which enabled validator withdrawals for the first time. This timing allows institutional players to re-evaluate their staking commitments with newfound flexibility previously unavailable in the locked staking era. Comparative Analysis of Institutional Staking Moves Metric Bitmain Shapelink Transaction Type Staking Deposit Withdrawal Request ETH Amount 74,880 ETH 35,627 ETH USD Value (March 2025) $210 Million $100 Million Validator Equivalents ~2,340 Nodes ~1,114 Nodes Timeframe Multi-month Accumulation 48-hour Execution Network Impact Increased Security Reduced Participation Broader Implications for Ethereum’s Staking Ecosystem These contrasting transactions occur within a rapidly evolving staking landscape. Ethereum’s total staked ETH recently surpassed 30% of circulating supply, representing over $100 billion in committed value. The entry of major institutional players like Bitmain accelerates several important trends: Professionalization of Validation: Large-scale operators bring enterprise-grade security and reliability practices. Increased Network Decentralization: New institutional validators diversify the validator set beyond early stakers. Liquidity Management Evolution: The ability to enter and exit positions influences corporate treasury strategies. Yield Competition: Institutional participation may compress staking yields over time through increased competition. Simultaneously, exits like Shapelink’s demonstrate the maturing liquidity options available to institutional stakers. The unstaking process, once requiring weeks for queue processing, now operates with predictable timelines thanks to protocol improvements. This liquidity flexibility makes staking more attractive to corporate treasuries that require asset accessibility alongside yield generation. Regulatory and Compliance Considerations Institutional staking activities increasingly navigate complex regulatory environments. Different jurisdictions treat staking rewards as interest income, capital gains, or business income for tax purposes. Large-scale operators like Bitmain must implement robust compliance frameworks including: Transaction monitoring for anti-money laundering requirements Accurate reward reporting for tax authorities Geographic restrictions based on regulatory permissions Corporate structure optimization for liability protection These compliance burdens create barriers to entry that may concentrate institutional staking among well-resourced players. However, they also legitimize the activity for traditional financial institutions considering cryptocurrency exposure. The transparent on-chain nature of these transactions provides regulators with unprecedented visibility into institutional crypto activities compared to traditional financial markets. Historical Context and Market Cycle Analysis Bitmain’s substantial ETH accumulation follows a challenging period for mining companies after Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake. The company previously derived significant revenue from Ethereum mining hardware sales before The Merge rendered those products obsolete. Their pivot to staking represents a strategic adaptation to fundamental blockchain protocol changes. Historical data shows mining companies have successfully transitioned to validation services in previous cycles, though rarely at this scale or velocity. Market cycle analysis reveals institutional staking activity often increases during periods of network maturity and regulatory clarity. The current phase follows several key developments: Ethereum’s successful transition to proof-of-stake consensus (September 2022) Implementation of validator withdrawals (April 2023) Growing institutional custody solutions for staked assets (2023-2024) Clearer regulatory guidance in major jurisdictions (2024-2025) These developments have created what analysts term the “institutional staking infrastructure” necessary for large-scale participation. The contrasting moves by Bitmain and Shapelink demonstrate how different institutions interpret the same market conditions through divergent strategic lenses. Conclusion The simultaneous Bitmain ETH staking and Shapelink unstaking transactions reveal a maturing institutional cryptocurrency landscape where sophisticated players execute billion-dollar strategies with precision timing. Bitmain’s $210 million commitment signals strong confidence in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake future and represents a strategic diversification beyond their mining heritage. Meanwhile, Shapelink’s $100 million exit demonstrates the liquidity flexibility now available to institutional stakers, enabling dynamic portfolio management. Together, these contrasting moves highlight the complex risk-reward calculations dominating institutional crypto investment in 2025, with Ethereum staking emerging as a critical arena for corporate treasury strategies and blockchain infrastructure commitments. FAQs Q1: What does staking mean in the context of Ethereum? Staking refers to the process of depositing ETH to activate validator software that processes transactions and creates new blocks on the Ethereum blockchain. Validators earn rewards for securing the network while their staked ETH serves as collateral against malicious behavior. Q2: Why would a company like Bitmain stake such a large amount of ETH? Companies stake ETH to generate yield on their cryptocurrency holdings while simultaneously supporting network security. For Bitmain specifically, this represents diversification from their traditional mining business and positions them within Ethereum’s growing proof-of-stake ecosystem. Q3: How does unstaking work on Ethereum? Since the Shanghai upgrade, validators can initiate withdrawal requests that enter a queue. After processing, staked ETH and accumulated rewards become available in the validator’s designated withdrawal address, typically within days depending on network activity. Q4: What impact do large institutional moves have on Ethereum’s network security? Bitmain’s staking increases the total value securing the network, making attacks more expensive. However, concentration among large validators presents decentralization concerns that the Ethereum community actively monitors and addresses through protocol improvements. Q5: Are staking rewards considered taxable income? Tax treatment varies by jurisdiction, but most countries consider staking rewards as taxable income at the time of receipt. Institutional stakers like Bitmain must implement robust accounting systems to track and report these rewards according to local regulations.

Despite this incremental rise, the index firmly remains entrenched in the “Extreme Fear” category, a persistent state that has defined market sentiment for much of the recent quarter. This data, sourced from Alternative.me on April 10, 2025, presents a complex picture of a market grappling with volatility while searching for a sustainable foundation. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Rise to 23 The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial barometer for the emotional temperature of the digital asset space. Consequently, its movement from 20 to 23, while minor, warrants detailed examination. The index operates on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies “Extreme Fear” and 100 represents “Extreme Greed.” Therefore, a reading of 23 places the market deep within the fear-dominated zone, specifically between 0 and 25. This metric synthesizes data from six core components, each weighted to reflect its impact on collective sentiment. Volatility (25%): This component analyzes price swings, particularly for Bitcoin. Notably, reduced volatility often contributes to a higher index score. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This factor examines trading volume and overall market momentum. Significantly, higher volume with positive price action typically boosts the index. Social Media (15%): Sentiment analysis on platforms like Twitter and Reddit gauges public conversation tone and volume. Surveys (15%): Periodic polls of the cryptocurrency community provide direct insight into investor expectations. Dominance (10%): Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap is a key stability indicator. Trends (10%): Google search volume for “Bitcoin” and related terms reflects mainstream interest and curiosity. The three-point increase likely stems from modest improvements across several of these inputs. For instance, a stabilization in Bitcoin’s price band or a slight uptick in trading volume could trigger the change. However, the overarching “Extreme Fear” classification underscores that these improvements remain fragile and nascent. Historical Context and Market Sentiment Analysis To fully grasp the significance of a score of 23, we must place it within a historical framework. The index has experienced dramatic swings throughout cryptocurrency’s history. For example, it plummeted to single digits during the March 2020 COVID-19 market crash and again following major industry collapses in 2022. Conversely, it soared above 90 during the euphoric peaks of late 2017 and late 2021. Currently, the market’s prolonged residence in “Extreme Fear” contrasts sharply with those periods of unchecked optimism. This persistent fear often correlates with specific market behaviors. Investors typically exhibit risk aversion, favoring stablecoins or off-ramping to fiat currency. Moreover, leveraged positions decrease, and funding rates in perpetual swap markets may turn negative. Importantly, seasoned analysts frequently interpret prolonged fear as a potential contrarian indicator. Historically, accumulation by long-term holders often accelerates during these phases, setting the stage for future rallies when sentiment eventually pivots. Expert Insight on Sentiment as a Lagging Indicator Market strategists and behavioral finance experts emphasize that sentiment indices like the Fear & Greed Index are often lagging, not leading, indicators. “Sentiment reflects the pain or joy of recent price action,” notes Dr. Anya Sharma, a financial psychologist at the Digital Asset Research Institute. “A move from 20 to 23 doesn’t forecast a bull market. Instead, it confirms that the intense selling pressure and negative news flow of the prior weeks may be abating slightly. The market is catching its breath, not necessarily preparing to run.” This perspective is crucial for investors who might misinterpret a small rise as an all-clear signal. The 2025 Regulatory and Macroeconomic Landscape The current sentiment cannot be divorced from the broader environment of 2025. Several key factors continue to exert pressure on investor psychology. First, the global macroeconomic picture remains uncertain, with central banks navigating a complex path between inflation control and economic growth. Higher interest rates have traditionally dampened appetite for speculative assets like cryptocurrency. Second, the regulatory landscape for digital assets is still crystallizing in major economies like the United States and the European Union. While clarity is ultimately positive, the process creates short-term uncertainty. Third, the industry continues to mature post-2022, with a heightened focus on institutional infrastructure, proof-of-reserves, and compliance. This maturation is fundamentally healthy but occurs alongside a decline in the retail speculation that previously drove sentiment to extreme greed. The table below summarizes the primary forces influencing the Fear & Greed Index in the current climate. Factor Impact on Sentiment (2025) Likely Effect on Index Macroeconomic Uncertainty Negative Pressure Pulls score toward Fear Ongoing Regulatory Development Mixed (Uncertainty vs. Clarity) Creates volatility in score Industry Maturation & Institutional Adoption Long-term Positive, Short-term Neutral Provides a floor, limiting extreme fear Reduced Retail Leverage & Speculation Reduces Volatility Can stabilize score, prevent wild swings Practical Implications for Cryptocurrency Investors For market participants, the index provides a valuable tool for emotional discipline. A reading in Extreme Fear suggests that panic selling may be prevalent, potentially creating buying opportunities for those with a long-term horizon and robust risk management. Conversely, it also signals that a swift, sustained recovery is not immediately guaranteed. Investors should use the index not as a standalone trading signal but as one piece of a comprehensive analysis puzzle that includes on-chain data, fundamental project health, and macroeconomic trends. Furthermore, the index’s multi-factor composition reminds us that market sentiment is multifaceted. A rise driven by increased social media volume differs fundamentally from a rise driven by surging Bitcoin dominance. Therefore, savvy observers look beyond the headline number to the underlying components for a more nuanced understanding of the market’s drivers. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s ascent to 23 represents a faint heartbeat in a market still diagnosed with Extreme Fear. This minor improvement reflects tentative stabilization rather than a decisive shift in trend. The index remains a critical gauge of market psychology, deeply influenced by volatility, volume, and social discourse. In the context of 2025’s evolving regulatory and macroeconomic landscape, understanding this sentiment metric is more important than ever for navigating the complex cryptocurrency ecosystem. While the climb from 20 to 23 offers a glimmer of hope, the predominant narrative remains one of caution, underscoring the market’s ongoing journey toward stability and maturity. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 23 mean? A score of 23 indicates the market is in a state of “Extreme Fear,” though it shows a slight improvement from a lower reading. It suggests investor sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, often associated with panic selling or high risk aversion, but may be stabilizing at a low level. Q2: How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? The index is calculated using six weighted factors: volatility (25%), market momentum and volume (25%), social media sentiment (15%), surveys (15%), Bitcoin’s market dominance (10%), and Google search trends (10%). These are combined to produce a single score from 0 to 100. Q3: Is Extreme Fear a good time to buy cryptocurrency? Historically, periods of Extreme Fear have sometimes preceded market recoveries, as prices may be depressed. However, it is not a guaranteed buy signal. Extreme Fear can persist, and prices may fall further. It should be considered alongside fundamental analysis and personal risk tolerance. Q4: How often does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index update? The index updates daily, providing a near real-time snapshot of market sentiment based on the previous 24 hours of data across its various sources. Q5: What is the difference between fear and greed in market sentiment? Fear drives selling, risk-off behavior, and capital preservation, often leading to undervalued assets. Greed drives buying, excessive risk-taking, and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), often leading to asset bubbles and overvaluation. The index measures the balance between these two emotions.

The China-based company adopted this decision after observing the challenges faced in the mining industry. In a statement, TheMinerMag, a specialized digital publication and data platform focused primarily on the Bitcoin mining industry, among other fields, announced that Bitmain has started offering bundle deals and discounts covering various models. Some of these models include the company’s Antminer S19 and S21 series of application-specific integrated circuit mining machines. In early 2025, these series machines would have been perceived as “distressed sales,” that is, when the price of BTC was increasing. Uncertainties surrounding the mining industry sparks tension in the sector Following TheMinerMag’s report, sources pointed out that even the recently launched top-quality mining hardware, such as the S21 immersion-cooled ASICs, is being set for sale with discounts of about $7 per terahash-second (TH/s). What caught many by surprise was recently released news that highlighted that some bundles were actually auctioned off to miners who were given the chance to choose their preferred prices freely. These recent price reductions occurred during one of the most challenging periods for profit margins in the mining industry, according to reports. An example supported this point. In this case, it highlighted the present state experienced in the hashprice. According to the situation, the hashprice, a key Bitcoin mining metric showing the expected daily dollar revenue per unit of hashing power (TH/s or PH/s), has reportedly dropped to a low experienced in years of about $35 per terahash/second per day (TH/s/day). Concerning this finding, it is worth noting that a margin of $40 per TH/s/day is widely recognized as the break-even point for miners. Such a scenario prompts several operators to consider closing down their operations until they are certain that the economic conditions have improved. Meanwhile, reports have noted that the current situation highlights a significant economic challenge in the mining sector, which is reportedly highly competitive even under ideal circumstances. For instance, the sector is facing a decline in the Bitcoin market, price increases for energy, regulatory challenges, and risks associated with the supply chain. To address this situation, the mining firms joined forces to look for other effective solutions. One of the proposed solutions is that the companies are considering renewable energy to cut costs after the halving event in April 2024. This event reduced the block reward to 3.125 Bitcoin per block. Analysts express disappointment after noting 2025 as an amazing year for BTC Regarding the mining companies’ consideration, sources mentioned that the smaller block reward normally gets offset by the surge in Bitcoin’s price every four years. Nonetheless, 2025 came to a disappointing end, despite being anticipated as a remarkable year for the cryptocurrency industry. During the year, the price declined drastically from a peak of more than $126,000, recorded in October, to a low point of around $80,000 in November. Currently, reports from CoinMarketCap indicate that the price of BTC is over 7% lower than its record on January 1 of this year. Additionally, it is around 20% below its highest point of more than $109,000 recorded on January 20. Notably, this record was observed during the day of US President Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

This crucial metric, a barometer for market cycle phases, provides a stark and data-driven snapshot of current capital flows. Consequently, understanding this index offers vital context for portfolio strategy and risk assessment during a complex market phase. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index and Its Steady Reading CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index serves as a primary gauge for market sentiment between Bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies. The platform calculates this index by analyzing the 90-day price performance of the top 100 digital assets by market capitalization. Importantly, the calculation excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to focus purely on speculative assets. An official “altcoin season” triggers only if 75% of these top coins outperform Bitcoin during the measured period. Therefore, a score of 16 remains profoundly distant from the threshold of 100, which would indicate overwhelming altcoin strength. This persistent low score underscores a market narrative still heavily centered on Bitcoin’s performance. Historical Context and Market Cycle Analysis Examining historical data reveals clear patterns. Previous bull markets, notably in 2017 and 2021, witnessed the Altcoin Season Index soaring above 75 for sustained periods. During those epochs, capital rapidly rotated from Bitcoin into smaller-cap assets, chasing higher returns. Conversely, the current stagnation at 16 aligns more closely with consolidation or accumulation phases that typically follow major market corrections. For instance, similar index levels were observed in late 2019 before the subsequent market run. This historical parallel provides a framework for analysts to evaluate potential future trajectories, though past performance never guarantees future results. Expert Analysis on Capital Rotation and Investor Psychology Market analysts emphasize that the index reflects deeper capital allocation trends. “A low Altcoin Season Index fundamentally indicates risk-off sentiment or a preference for liquidity,” explains a report from a major blockchain analytics firm. “Investors often retreat to Bitcoin, perceived as digital gold, during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty or regulatory scrutiny.” This behavioral pattern was evident throughout 2023 and into 2024, as traditional finance interest via Bitcoin ETFs solidified its flagship status. Meanwhile, altcoin projects must demonstrate substantial utility or technological breakthroughs to attract capital away from the market leader. The Technical Mechanics Behind the Index Calculation The methodology is rigorous and transparent. First, CoinMarketCap compiles the list of the top 100 coins. Next, it filters out assets designed for price stability. Then, it performs a direct 90-day return comparison for each remaining asset against Bitcoin. Finally, it calculates the percentage that outperformed. This process yields the single-figure index. The 90-day window is strategic; it smooths out short-term volatility while capturing medium-term trend shifts. For traders, this creates a reliable, albeit lagging, indicator of market regime change. Data Set: Top 100 coins by market cap. Exclusions: Stablecoins (USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (wBTC). Time Frame: Rolling 90-day performance period. Benchmark: Bitcoin’s (BTC) price performance. Threshold: 75% outperformance required for “season.” Broader Market Implications and Sector Performance The steady index reading does not imply uniform stagnation across all altcoins. Indeed, specific sectors like decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) or real-world asset (RWA) tokenization have shown isolated strength. However, these movements remain insufficient to move the aggregate index significantly. The broader implication is clear: market-wide, risk capital remains cautious. Major catalysts like Ethereum ETF approvals or definitive regulatory clarity could serve as potential triggers for index movement. Until then, the market appears to be in a holding pattern, building a base for the next cycle. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index holding at 16 delivers a unambiguous message about the current cryptocurrency market structure. Bitcoin dominance persists, reflecting a cautious macro environment and a maturation phase for the broader digital asset class. For investors, this index provides a critical, objective tool to gauge market cycles beyond mere price speculation. Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index for a sustained break above 50 will be essential for signaling a genuine shift in momentum toward alternative cryptocurrencies. FAQs Q1: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 16 mean? An index value of 16 means only a small percentage (roughly 16%) of the top altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the prior 90 days. It indicates a market strongly dominated by Bitcoin’s performance. Q2: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? CoinMarketCap updates the Altcoin Season Index daily, providing a near real-time view of the changing performance dynamics between Bitcoin and major alternative cryptocurrencies. Q3: Has the crypto market ever experienced a true “altcoin season”? Yes, historically. During major bull markets, the index has exceeded 75 for prolonged periods, notably in 2017-2018 and 2021, when capital flooded into altcoins, generating extraordinary returns. Q4: Can the index predict future price movements? The index is a descriptive lagging indicator, not a predictive tool. It confirms a trend that is already in place. However, a sustained rise above key levels can signal a changing market regime that may continue. Q5: Why are stablecoins excluded from the Altcoin Season Index calculation? Stablecoins are excluded because they are designed to maintain a peg to a fiat currency and do not exhibit speculative price appreciation. Their inclusion would distort the measurement of risk-on capital rotation into volatile assets.

Long periods of dominance, followed by a phase where growth slows and attention begins to drift elsewhere. It does not happen overnight. It starts quietly, with capital scanning for opportunities that look less crowded and more flexible. That is the context behind recent conversations pointing toward a $0.035 new cryptocurrency. For those asking what crypto to buy now ahead of 2026, this shift is becoming easier to understand. Rather than abandoning Bitcoin, many early holders are simply looking to complement it. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin remains the largest and most recognized cryptocurrency in the world. Its market cap sits far above every other digital asset, and its role as a store of value is firmly established. Early investors benefited enormously as BTC moved from double digits to five figures. Today, Bitcoin faces a different challenge. Price action has struggled to move decisively beyond the $100K zone. Market commentators often describe this level as a major resistance area. Breaking above it requires sustained inflows of capital on a massive scale. Some analysts believe that even in a positive scenario, Bitcoin’s upside into 2026 may be limited compared to earlier cycles. Projections often point to modest multiples rather than dramatic growth. A 1.5x or 2x move from current levels would still be significant in absolute terms, but it does not compare to the kind of returns early Bitcoin investors once experienced. This is why some long-term holders are now exploring smaller cryptocurrency projects that offer higher upside potential from lower starting points. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Trying to Build That search has brought Mutuum Finance (MUTM) into focus. Mutuum Finance is a DeFi crypto designed to build a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol focused on real usage rather than short-term attention. The goal is straightforward. Allow users to supply assets, earn yield, and borrow against collateral in a system that adjusts automatically based on market conditions. Instead of fixed incentives, the protocol relies on utilization to balance liquidity and demand. According to official statements shared on X, V1 of the Mutuum Finance lending and borrowing protocol is planned for the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. Core features include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an automated liquidator bot. Initial supported assets will be ETH and USDT. Presale Progress and Why It Matters While early Bitcoin investors are known for patience, they also pay close attention to numbers. Mutuum Finance’s presale has shown steady growth since early 2025. The current token price is $0.035, and participation has expanded consistently rather than suddenly. So far, the project has raised $19.45M, with 18,650 holders taking part. A total of 825M tokens have already been sold. From a fixed 4B total supply, 45.5% is allocated to the presale, which equals roughly 1.82B tokens. Phase 6 of the presale is now over 99% allocated, meaning supply at the current price is almost gone. The official launch price is set at $0.06, which has shaped many of the current growth discussions.. In addition, MUTM is positioned as a utility token within the ecosystem. It is designed to be used for protocol-related interactions, which some analysts believe strengthens long-term demand compared to purely speculative assets. Why Bitcoin Investors Are Paying Attention Bitcoin early adopters tend to look for asymmetric opportunities. These are situations where downside is defined, but upside remains open. Mutuum Finance fits that profile more closely than large-cap assets at this stage. At $0.035, the entry point is still low relative to the planned launch price. Some analysts believe that if adoption develops as expected, MUTM could see 200% to 300% growth shortly after launch. In more optimistic scenarios tied to usage, exchange visibility, and supply dynamics, projections show up to 600% growth into 2026. This is not framed as a certainty. It is a model based on execution and timing. Still, it helps explain why experienced Bitcoin investors are starting to watch this new cryptocurrency more closely. Stablecoin Plans and Oracle Infrastructure Beyond lending and borrowing, Mutuum Finance plans to introduce a stablecoin backed by multiple assets. This design allows borrowers to use diverse collateral rather than relying on a single token. By spreading risk, the system can remain more stable during volatile market conditions. Accurate pricing is essential for any lending protocol. Mutuum Finance’s design anticipates the use of decentralized oracle feeds such as Chainlink, along with fallback and aggregated data sources. These feeds help ensure fair collateral valuation and reliable liquidation triggers. Market commentators suggest that strong oracle infrastructure is often overlooked, yet critical. In a bullish scenario, analysts believe that combining lending, a stablecoin, and reliable price data can support broader adoption over time. The Bigger Picture Security is another area that matters to long-term investors. Mutuum Finance has completed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 token scan score, providing an early layer of confidence. An independent audit with Halborn Security is currently in progress, reviewing finalized lending and borrowing contracts. The project has also launched a $50k bug bounty focused on identifying code vulnerabilities. This proactive approach is often viewed positively by analysts, especially those comparing new cryptocurrency projects against established standards. Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of the cryptocurrency market. Its role is not in question. What is changing is how investors allocate around it. As BTC faces resistance near $100K and its growth profile matures, attention naturally shifts toward projects with earlier-stage potential. Mutuum Finance, priced at $0.035 and nearing the end of Phase 6, represents that kind of opportunity. With a V1 launch planned, strong presale participation, stablecoin development, and multiple security layers, it is entering a phase where early positioning becomes more difficult to find.

56425026,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=254563,1766797211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Pantera Capital’s Strategic $15.39M Ethereum Deposit to Coinbase Prime Reveals Calculated Institutional Move,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/pantera-capital-ethereum-coinbase-deposit/,"BitcoinWorld Pantera Capital’s Strategic $15.39M Ethereum Deposit to Coinbase Prime Reveals Calculated Institutional Move In a significant blockchain transaction capturing institutional attention, two addresses linked to prominent investment firm Pantera Capital deposited 5,264 Ethereum tokens worth $15.39 million to Coinbase Prime this week, according to verified on-chain data from Onchainlens. This substantial movement of digital assets represents one of the most noteworthy institutional cryptocurrency transactions of early 2025, potentially signaling strategic portfolio adjustments amid evolving market conditions. The transaction occurred against a backdrop of regulatory clarity and institutional adoption milestones that have characterized the cryptocurrency landscape throughout the past year. Pantera Capital’s Ethereum Transaction Analysis The blockchain data reveals precise transaction details that merit careful examination. Onchainlens, a respected blockchain analytics platform, identified the two Ethereum addresses through their transaction patterns and historical connections to Pantera Capital’s known wallet activities. The 5,264 ETH transfer represents approximately 0.004% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply, making it a substantial but not market-moving transaction by volume standards. The deposit reached Coinbase Prime, the exchange’s institutional platform designed specifically for high-net-worth individuals, family offices, and corporate entities seeking sophisticated cryptocurrency services. Transaction timing provides crucial context for understanding this movement. The deposit occurred during a period of relative stability in Ethereum’s price, which has maintained a trading range between $2,800 and $3,200 throughout the first quarter of 2025. Market analysts immediately noted several possible interpretations of this transaction. Some experts suggest the move represents routine portfolio rebalancing, while others speculate it could signal preparation for upcoming Ethereum network developments or regulatory considerations affecting institutional holdings. Institutional Cryptocurrency Strategy Evolution Pantera Capital’s transaction history reveals patterns worth noting. The firm, founded in 2013 by Dan Morehead, has established itself as one of the earliest and most successful cryptocurrency-focused investment firms. Their portfolio strategy typically combines long-term holdings with tactical adjustments based on market conditions and technological developments. Previous blockchain analyses show Pantera maintaining significant Ethereum positions since 2017, with periodic adjustments during major market cycles and protocol upgrades. Institutional cryptocurrency custody options have expanded dramatically since 2023. The table below illustrates the progression: Year Primary Custody Method Notable Developments 2021-2022 Self-custody solutions Institutions managed private keys internally 2023 Hybrid approaches Combination of exchanges and specialized custodians 2024-2025 Regulated prime services Platforms like Coinbase Prime offering insured custody Market Impact and Broader Implications The cryptocurrency market responds to institutional movements with particular sensitivity. Large transactions from recognized entities like Pantera Capital often trigger analysis across trading desks and investment committees worldwide. Market data from the past 72 hours shows several related developments. First, Ethereum’s trading volume increased by approximately 18% following the transaction’s public reporting. Second, options market activity indicates heightened interest in Ethereum derivatives, particularly call options with strike prices above $3,500 for quarterly expirations. Several factors make this transaction particularly noteworthy in early 2025. Regulatory developments have created clearer frameworks for institutional cryptocurrency holdings. The SEC’s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in late 2024 established new pathways for traditional finance integration. Additionally, Ethereum’s ongoing transition to a fully proof-of-stake consensus mechanism has progressed through several successful upgrades, reducing environmental concerns that previously limited institutional participation. Expert Perspectives on Institutional Movements Industry analysts offer varied interpretations of this transaction. Blockchain forensic specialists emphasize the technical aspects. “The movement to Coinbase Prime suggests preparation for potential trading activity or secure custody arrangements,” notes Dr. Elena Rodriguez, a blockchain researcher at Stanford’s Digital Asset Lab. “Institutional players increasingly utilize prime brokerage services for their operational efficiency and regulatory compliance features.” Market strategists consider broader implications. “This transaction size represents meaningful but not extraordinary position adjustment,” observes Michael Chen, chief investment officer at Digital Wealth Management. “The more significant story is the continued institutional engagement with Ethereum despite recent volatility and regulatory scrutiny.” Historical data supports this perspective. Institutional Ethereum holdings have grown steadily since 2023, with quarterly inflows averaging $850 million across regulated platforms. Technical and Operational Considerations Blockchain technology enables unprecedented transaction transparency. The Ethereum blockchain records every transaction with timestamp, amount, and wallet addresses. Analysis of the two sending addresses reveals several characteristics. Both addresses show patterns consistent with institutional rather than individual ownership. They maintained substantial Ethereum balances for extended periods, engaged in relatively infrequent transactions, and previously interacted with known institutional service providers. Coinbase Prime’s institutional features likely influenced this deposit decision. The platform offers several advantages for large-scale cryptocurrency holders: Enhanced security protocols exceeding standard exchange protections Insurance coverage for digital asset custody Direct market access with improved liquidity options Regulatory compliance frameworks meeting institutional requirements Advanced reporting tools for portfolio management and auditing Transaction mechanics followed standard Ethereum protocol procedures. The transfer required payment of gas fees, which averaged 35 gwei during the transaction window, resulting in approximately $42 in network fees. The transaction confirmation occurred within two minutes, demonstrating Ethereum’s improved scalability following recent network upgrades. Historical Context and Pattern Recognition Pantera Capital’s cryptocurrency strategy has evolved through multiple market cycles. The firm initially focused primarily on Bitcoin during cryptocurrency’s early institutional adoption phase. Their portfolio diversification into Ethereum began in earnest during 2017, coinciding with growing recognition of smart contract platforms’ potential. Previous blockchain analyses reveal pattern consistency in their transaction behavior. Pantera typically makes substantial movements during periods of technical transition or regulatory milestone events. The current transaction fits within established behavioral patterns. Similar movements occurred before major Ethereum upgrades, including the Merge transition to proof-of-stake in 2022 and subsequent Shanghai upgrade enabling staking withdrawals. Market conditions in early 2025 present several parallels to previous adjustment periods. Ethereum’s price has consolidated following a 2024 rally, network activity has stabilized after period of high volatility, and regulatory frameworks have reached new clarity levels. Regulatory Environment and Compliance Factors Institutional cryptocurrency transactions increasingly consider regulatory dimensions. The 2025 regulatory landscape differs substantially from previous years. Clearer classification of digital assets, established custody requirements, and reporting standards have emerged across major jurisdictions. These developments reduce uncertainty for institutional participants like Pantera Capital. Compliance considerations likely influenced the Coinbase Prime deposit decision, as regulated platforms provide documented compliance with evolving standards. Tax implications represent another consideration. Large cryptocurrency movements trigger reporting requirements under current regulations. Institutional investors must document transaction purposes, cost basis calculations, and potential tax liabilities. The timing of this transaction, occurring early in the calendar year, may facilitate streamlined accounting and reporting processes for the firm’s 2025 financial activities. Conclusion Pantera Capital’s $15.39 million Ethereum deposit to Coinbase Prime represents a significant institutional cryptocurrency transaction with multiple potential interpretations. The movement highlights continued institutional engagement with digital assets amid evolving market conditions and regulatory frameworks. While the specific motivation behind this transaction remains known only to Pantera’s investment committee, the observable patterns suggest strategic positioning rather than reactive trading. This transaction reinforces Ethereum’s status as a core institutional holding within diversified cryptocurrency portfolios. As blockchain transparency enables detailed transaction analysis, market participants gain valuable insights into institutional strategies and market dynamics. The Pantera Capital Ethereum deposit ultimately demonstrates the maturation of cryptocurrency markets and the sophisticated approaches institutional investors now employ within this asset class. FAQs Q1: What is Coinbase Prime and how does it differ from regular Coinbase? Coinbase Prime is a specialized platform designed for institutional investors, offering enhanced security, dedicated customer support, advanced trading tools, and compliance features tailored to large-scale cryptocurrency transactions and custody needs. Q2: How do analysts link blockchain addresses to specific institutions like Pantera Capital? Blockchain analysts use pattern recognition, transaction history analysis, and sometimes publicly disclosed information to establish connections between wallet addresses and known entities, though absolute certainty requires direct confirmation from the institutions themselves. Q3: What percentage of Ethereum’s total supply does this transaction represent? The 5,264 ETH transfer represents approximately 0.004% of Ethereum’s circulating supply, making it substantial for an individual transaction but not large enough to significantly impact overall market liquidity or price discovery mechanisms. Q4: Why would an institution move cryptocurrency to an exchange rather than keeping it in cold storage? Institutions may transfer assets to exchanges for several reasons including preparation for trading activity, utilization of institutional services like lending or staking, enhanced security through insured custody, or compliance with regulatory requirements for certain types of holdings. Q5: How has institutional cryptocurrency custody evolved in recent years? Custody solutions have progressed from basic self-custody to sophisticated institutional-grade services offering insurance, regulatory compliance, advanced security protocols, and integration with traditional financial systems, reducing barriers to institutional participation.

XRP Forecasts Dipped A recent poll conducted by cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, running from December 12 to 23, reveals that 73% of investors predict XRP will finish the year between $1.50 and $2.00, suggesting a muted conclusion for the altcoin’s performance in 2025. Just weeks prior, market sentiment was more optimistic, with around 38% of traders expecting XRP to rally to a range of $2.00 to $2.50 by December 31. However, that figure has since dropped to 28%, reflecting a significant decline in confidence. Related Reading: Bitcoin Correction Timeline: Analyst Predicts Potential Bottom In October 2026 The possibility of the cryptocurrency exceeding $2.50 appears almost non-existent, as only about 4% of respondents foresee it reaching the $2.50 to $3.00 range, and a similar 4% predict it could surpass $3.00. The consensus of 73% predicting an XRP finish between $1.50 and $2.00 marks an increase from the 63% recorded earlier in the poll. This growing alignment among poll participants indicates that they are consolidating around this range as the most likely scenario. Furthermore, the sentiment towards higher price levels has significantly shifted. The percentage of voters anticipating a rally into the mid-$2 range has dwindled to a mere 4%, reflecting dwindling confidence after several failed attempts to break through resistance levels. Even the outlook for the altcoin’s price to drop below $1.50 has risen slightly to 7%, up from 6%, although most believe a sharp sell-off is unlikely. Rising Supply From Early Investors This prevailing sentiment aligns with Futures data indicating a prevalence of aggressive sell orders, while the slow accumulation of XRP in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) at a pace of $30 to $50 million daily cannot keep up with profit-taking and risk reduction activities in the market. On-chain data reveals that significant realized gains have been secured as XRP approached its recent highs. For instance, a long-term holder who initially acquired the altcoin around $0.40 sold over 350 million tokens at approximately $2.00, reaping an estimated profit of $721 million. Related Reading: Ethereum Fails To Surpass $3,000: Predictions For The Final Days Of The Year With many early investors reportedly cashing out at the $2 level, there has been minimal support for dip-buying to bolster the price, keeping it in the current range between $1.7 and $1.8 recorded in the week. Experts suggest that when the supply increases from long-term holders, whose initial investments were made at $0.40 to $0.60, it creates a resistance ceiling that is challenging to break without substantial new demand entering the market. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $1.830. The altcoin has recorded major losses in all time frames, with a year-to-date decline of 15%, in line with the broader market’s performance.

Speaking on CNBC, the newly confirmed NASA Administrator said the United States will head back to the moon under President Donald Trump’s second term. And this time, it’s for what Jared calls the “orbital economy.” “We want to have that opportunity to explore and realize the scientific, economic and national security potential on the moon,” Jared said during the interview. He pointed directly to Trump’s renewed interest in space, calling it the key to turning the moon into an off-Earth economic hub. The US Senate had finally confirmed Jared’s appointment last week after a chaotic back-and-forth that dragged all through 2025. Trump’s NASA pick returns with space business agenda Trump first picked Jared to run NASA back in December 2024. Then, in May, he suddenly yanked the nomination. No reason was given, but insiders allegedly pointed fingers at Jared’s tight relationship with Elon, since Trump and the latter publicly broke up last summer. But the beef didn’t last. Trump circled back in November and renominated Jared, who already had the astronaut badge after flying on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon in 2021. Now he’s not just aiming for the moon.Jared laid out plans for space data centers, nuclear power, and Helium-3 mining. The rare gas could be a future fuel for fusion reactors and is buried in the moon’s surface. He also wants a permanent base, with nuclear propulsion systems ready to go beyond the moon. That’s not a fantasy. Jared made it clear that these ideas are already in motion. NASA is working with SpaceX, Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, and Boeing under the Artemis campaign, which focuses on building a long-term presence on the moon and preparing for missions to Mars. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act gave this campaign a huge boost by dropping $9.9 billion into NASA’s pocket earlier this year. Artemis II, the first crewed test flight on NASA’s Space Launch System and Orion spacecraft, is scheduled soon. That mission will be followed by Artemis III, with SpaceX providing the lunar landing vehicle. Jared also said both SpaceX and Blue Origin are making reusable heavy-lift rockets using on-orbit cryogenic propellant transfer. He said , “That’s what’s going to enable us to be able to go to and from the moon affordably, with great frequency, and set up for missions to Mars and beyond.” Tesla’s Cybertruck problem gets a SpaceX-sized bailout Back on Earth, Tesla’s numbers are looking ugly. The company is struggling to sell even 20,000 Cybertrucks a year. That’s a far cry from Elon’s original promise of 500,000 units. Warehouses are now overflowing with unsold trucks. Production has already been scaled back. But here comes SpaceX. The company bought over 1,000 Cybertrucks, and they might double that soon. An X user posted a video showing a storage lot filled with the vehicles. With each truck priced around $80,000, SpaceX’s order could total between $80 million and $160 million in Tesla sales. Clearly, SpaceX is now turning into the main source of Elon’s wealth, not Tesla, like we’re used to. If things keep going this way, it will almost certainly even push his net worth over $1 trillion by this time next year. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The letter , shared publicly, offers a short, personal account of intake procedures, the move into housing, and his first days behind bars. He wrote that the place was “confusing and unnatural”, yet “manageable”, and that fellow inmates had treated him with respect. Inside The Prison Letter Rodriguez wrote that he had gone through searches and medical checks during intake, and that he was settling in after what he called an emotional goodbye to family days before the holiday. The note was dated Christmas Eve and marked his seventh day at the facility. Reports said his wife was scheduled as his first visitor on Christmas Day. Those details make the timing — and the human side of the story — hard to miss. Rodriguez was sentenced on Nov. 19 on charges tied to his role in a crypto mixing protocol. His case has become a touchpoint for a wider dispute about whether building or maintaining privacy software can carry criminal liability when others misuse those tools. The debate has drawn comparisons to the prosecution of Roman Storm, a co-founder of Tornado Cash, and raised questions about how the law treats open-source code and the people who write it. Samourai: Legal Debate Over Code And Crime Supporters say Rodriguez’s prosecution threatens free speech and software development. A petition asking for clemency gathered more than 12,000 signatures, and many privacy advocates argue that no direct victims were harmed by his work. In public posts, Rodriguez framed his case as “lawfare” and criticized regulators and judges for targeting innovation. Those claims have been repeated widely in crypto circles. Prosecutors argue differently. They point to the structure and promotion of certain tools and say some actors used them to hide illicit transfers. Courts have faced the hard question of where to draw the line between code as neutral technology and code used to facilitate crime. That tension is central to why Rodriguez’s sentence has drawn such attention from developers, legal scholars, and privacy groups. Samourai Drama: Calls For Clemency Gain Traction US President Donald Trump said on Dec. 16 that he would “take a look” at Rodriguez’s case after it gained public attention. That brief remark kept the possibility of executive clemency in public view, though such reviews do not always lead to action. Rodriguez publicly appealed to the president for a pardon as he began serving his sentence. Public reaction has been mixed. Some see the petition and media coverage as a push to protect open-source developers. Others stress that courts will weigh evidence about intent and conduct, not just the code itself. What remains clear is that this case has pulled the issue into the open and made it harder for lawmakers and courts to ignore.

The arrest, confirmed by both Coinbase and Indian police in Hyderabad, came months after hackers bribed customer service staff to steal customer information. This triggered a $20 million ransom demand and left the company facing a $400 million fallout. The breach began in May, when hackers managed to buy access from Coinbase contractors outside the U.S. and gain entry to internal systems. They didn’t hack through firewalls or code, they just found staff and offered cash. “What these attackers were doing was finding Coinbase employees and contractors based in India who were associated with our business process outsourcing or support operations, that kind of thing, and bribing them in order to obtain customer data,” said Philip Martin, Coinbase’s Chief Security Officer. Coinbase says access was shut down quickly The breach was so wide that it allowed attackers near-instant access to customer accounts for months. This type of social engineering attack has become a growing problem in the crypto world. It’s simple: pay someone on the inside. Philip denied that the hackers had full access the entire time. He said in an interview with Bloomberg News that once the company discovered staff were leaking data, their access was immediately revoked. “They did not have persistent access over the course of the entire period,” he claimed. The arrest was announced on X by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who wrote: “We have zero tolerance for bad behavior and will continue to work with law enforcement to bring bad actors to justice. Thanks to the Hyderabad Police in India, an ex-Coinbase customer service agent was just arrested. Another one down and more still to come.” Not everyone clapped. One user replied under Brian’s post: “lol why you acting like this is a win. You hired them in the first place.” Coinbase faces rising costs and deeper scrutiny Coinbase is still digging out of the mess.The cost of repairing damage and reimbursing affected users could be as high as $400 million, putting it among the top ten biggest crypto hacks ever, according to Elliptic. In February, Bybit suffered a similar attack that cost them $1.5 billion, and in total, $2.2 billion was lost to crypto hacks in 2024, per Chainalysis data. A Coinbase spokesperson confirmed the India arrest and said it followed the firm’s work with the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office, where charges were recently filed against a Brooklyn man accused of running “a long-running impersonation scheme targeting Coinbase customers.” Meanwhile, Coinbase shares slipped 1.2% to $236.79 on Friday, and are now down about 4.6% in 2025. Despite the chaos, Coinbase still holds most of the $122 billion in spot-Bitcoin ETF tokens, and remains a major political player. It’s become the largest crypto donor in U.S. politics, pouring over $52 million into campaigns during the 2024 cycle. The crypto industry overall made up half of the nearly $250 million in corporate political donations, with Coinbase leading the pack, according to watchdog group Public Citizen and data from OpenSecrets.

Roughly $1 trillion left active equity mutual funds as frustration built around weak stock selection and a market that refused to reward diversity. The S&P 500 kept hitting records, but the gains came from the same tight group of seven American tech giants. Owning anything else meant falling behind, and investors noticed. Fund managers who aimed for balance faced a brutal setup. A portfolio packed with many sectors looked sensible on paper, but the market only cared about megacap tech. That gap tested patience, specifically due to how wide it became between those winners and everything else, year after year. Money exits active strategies as market concentration tightens As the year moved on, cash flowed out steadily.Estimates from Bloomberg Intelligence using ICI data show about $1 trillion pulled from active equity mutual funds. That marked the 11th straight year of net outflows and the deepest of the cycle. Passive equity exchange-traded funds moved the other way and took in more than $600 billion. Investors didn’t rush for the exits all at once. They watched performance. Many paid fees for portfolios that looked different from the index. When those differences failed to pay off, patience ran out. Dave Mazza, chief executive officer of Roundhill Investments, said the setup worked against active managers. “The concentration makes it harder for active managers to do well,” Mazza said. “If you do not benchmark weight the Magnificent Seven, then you’re likely taking risk of underperformance.” Some market watchers expected stock picking to shine.Instead, the cost of straying from the benchmark stayed high all year.Market breadth stayed weak. On many days in the first half, fewer than 20% of stocks rallied with the market, based on BNY Investments data. That kind of narrow action can happen, but its length mattered. When gains keep coming from a tiny group, spreading bets hurts results. The same pattern showed up in the indexes. The S&P 500 beat its equal-weighted version all year. For investors, the choice was; go underweight large stocks and lag, or hug the index and explain why an active equity fee made sense. Few active funds beat benchmarks despite isolated standouts In the U.S., 73% of equity mutual funds lagged their benchmarks in 2025, according to Athanasios Psarofagis of Bloomberg Intelligence. That ranked as the fourth-worst showing since 2007. Results got worse after April’s tariff scare faded and excitement around artificial intelligence locked in tech leadership. There were exceptions, but they carried different risks.One came from Dimensional Fund Advisors.Its $14 billion International Small Cap Value Portfolio returned just over 50%, beating its benchmark, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq 100. The fund held about 1,800 stocks, mostly outside the U.S., with large exposure to financials, industrials, and materials. It avoided the U.S. large-cap index almost entirely. Joel Schneider, deputy head of portfolio management for North America, summed it up. “This year provides a really good lesson,” Schneider said. “Everyone knows that global diversification makes sense, but it’s really hard to stay disciplined and actually maintain that.” Another case came from Margie Patel at the Allspring Diversified Capital Builder Fund. The fund returned about 20%, helped by bets on Micron Technology and Advanced Micro Devices. Patel pushed back on closet indexing. “A lot of people like to be closet or quasi indexers,” she said on Bloomberg TV. “The winners are going to stay winners.” Big stocks getting bigger fueled bubble talk. The Nasdaq 100 traded above 30 times earnings and near six times sales. Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, who launched an AI-focused ETF in 2025 that grew to almost $1 billion, said volatility was part of the trade. “There are going to be white-knuckle moments,” Ives said. “We believe this tech bull market goes for another two years.” VanEck’s Global Resources Fund rose almost 40%, driven by demand tied to energy, farming, and metals, as the fund owns Shell, Exxon Mobil, and Barrick Mining, and mixes geologists with analysts. Shawn Reynolds, who has run it for 15 years, said active management allows big thematic bets.

Additionally, it was confirmed that while individuals had expressed excitement earlier, concerns about Zcash’s main token have decreased, and investors have demonstrated increased interest in its privacy features. This growing interest illustrated the fact that several users highly prefer private transactions. The crypto community expresses heightened interest in privacy features Regarding the current situation with Zcash privacy adoption , sources have attempted to explain that the stability surrounding the firm’s interest in privacy features was observed after a lengthy period of rapid growth encountered earlier this year. At this time, privacy solutions were the most preferred option within the crypto ecosystem. Moreover, recently released reports have highlighted that current data indicate that users who utilize these privacy tools continue to do so. Interestingly, a reliable source highlighted that the shift in focus towards privacy has not only increased for Zcash but also been identified in other initiatives. This was after a report earlier noted that other projects have also drawn the attention of several individuals and have increased in value. An example of these projects is Monero . Notably, Monero is a popular cryptocurrency project focused heavily on user privacy and anonymity. It has faced considerable gains, indicating that people have increasingly begun to embrace privacy solutions as they have become widely available across multiple platforms, rather than being restricted to just one platform. Meanwhile, as privacy solutions spread rapidly among users, sources have revealed that development efforts are starting to spread across various ecosystems and blockchains. These efforts are adopted as groups establish privacy-enhancing features purposefully to operate in their unique platforms. This increase witnessed in the crypto industry triggered analysts to predict that there is a high likelihood that the significance of privacy will continue to be embraced in 2026. Based on their anticipation, they clarified that the rise will be influenced by real-world needs rather than speculation, leading to the conclusion that the demand for privacy becomes evident as stablecoin payments and day-to-day on-chain transactions surge. On the other hand, analysts warned that the transparency of public blockchains can make regular payments complex due to the use of an on-chain wallet, which typically discloses one’s entire transaction history to others and their balances. Such a scenario is viewed as a significant privacy issue for both personal and business transactions. Grayscale undertakes an important step in the crypto ecosystem The heated discussions between the openness of blockchain technology and the demand for user privacy have prompted several individuals in the ecosystem to agree with the earlier argument, implying that privacy solutions will continue to be valued as crucial in this time when cryptocurrencies are moving towards practical payment uses. However, speculative interests change to other topics. In the meantime, reports last month noted the entry of a privacy coin to Wall Street. This statement highlights that the crypto ecosystem underwent a period when a technology designed to promote privacy was forced to operate within the highly regulated system of international finance. This situation was identified as Grayscale’s attempt to list a Zcash ETF on NYSE Arca with ticker ZCSH. With this move, sources acknowledged that Grayscale has taken a significant step in the industry to integrate a privacy coin into its comprehensive, transparent ecosystem of ETF filings, approved custodians, sanctions checks, and brokerage regulations. Ideally, the entire project serves as a test for a straightforward question: “Is it possible for privacy to be maintained under regulation, or does regulation fully overshadow privacy?” Don’t just read crypto news.

He believes such views are based on incomplete assumptions and overlook how value moves through global financial networks. As of this writing, XRP trades around $1.84, far below the level Jesse sees as achievable if adoption expands. Assessment of Transaction Scale Versus Cryptocurrency Valuation Jesse’s stance is rooted in payment throughput rather than speculation. He notes that Bitcoin commands a multi-trillion-dollar market presence but still handles relatively small settlement volume when compared with traditional finance. In contrast, central banks move far greater capital daily, often surpassing what Bitcoin processes across an entire year. From this comparison, Jesse argues that using Bitcoin’s valuation framework to judge XRP’s potential sets inaccurate limits, since both assets operate within distinct use cases and throughput expectations. People saying XRP can't go past $10 really haven't done their research. One Ripple partner (Bank of England) does more volume in one day than Bitcoin in a YEAR and it will use XRP to settle transactions. Wake up people! pic.twitter.com/BAi34TJ9VR — Apex Crypto Insights (NFA) (@APEXCONSULTNFA) December 17, 2025 Institutional Settlement as Ripple’s Strategic Advantage A central point in Jesse’s argument is Ripple’s positioning within financial infrastructure. While Bitcoin is generally treated as a store of value, Ripple has spent years building technology for cross-border payments and banking-grade settlement. Jesse believes this strategic focus gives XRP a different growth path from most digital assets. He highlights Ripple’s existing engagement with financial institutions and future opportunities for integration with banks and potentially central banks. If XRP becomes a settlement asset within systems that process significant liquidity, Jesse asserts that transactional volume could scale beyond what market-cap projections typically model. The Central Bank Dimension and the $10 Projection Jesse also calls attention to how many monetary authorities exist globally. With more than 170 central banks worldwide, he argues that focusing only on one example understates potential infrastructure demand. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In his view, claims that XRP cannot exceed $10 rely heavily on static market-cap calculations, without accounting for liquidity cycles, high-frequency settlement, or institutional utility. He rejects the idea that XRP’s valuation ceiling must remain low based on past performance, asserting that pricing models must also consider payment velocity in large transactions. Jesse maintains that XRP’s purpose is transactional rather than speculative, and price movements may lag behind real-world usage. He suggests that investors who base expectations solely on historical price action may overlook longer-term utility-driven appreciation. Reaching $10 from current prices would require roughly a five-fold increase and place XRP’s market capitalization near $600 billion, surpassing Ethereum’s previous valuation range. Although Jesse supports the likelihood of double-digit pricing under significant adoption, the view is not universal. Some observers believe such projections are optimistic, given that XRP has not sustained prices above $3.84 in nearly a decade. Others note that growing institutional accumulation and ETF activity could influence valuation trends over time.

The breach has impacted hundreds of users, with on-chain data showing that more than $6.77 million has already been stolen. The timing has amplified concern, coming at a moment when investors are already navigating heightened uncertainty, declining prices, and rising risk aversion. Related Reading: XRP Exchange Reserves On Binance Fall To Six-Month Low: Selling Pressure Is Easing According to the Trust Wallet team, the exploit appears to be linked to a recent update to its Chrome browser extension. In a public statement posted on X, the company urged users to take immediate action, stating: “Users with Browser Extension 2.68 should disable and upgrade to 2.69.” The message suggests that the vulnerability was isolated to a specific version of the extension, rather than the core wallet infrastructure, but the scale of the losses has nonetheless raised alarm. Trust Wallet is one of the most widely used self-custody wallets in the industry. Reporting a user base of roughly 220 million people globally. That reach makes any security incident particularly significant, not only because of the direct financial impact, but also due to the broader implications for trust in non-custodial platforms. As investigations continue and affected users assess the damage, the exploit adds another layer of stress to a market already grappling with weak sentiment and elevated skepticism toward crypto infrastructure. Funds Tracked As Trust Wallet Commits To Full Reimbursement On-chain investigators have begun tracing the movement of funds linked to the Trust Wallet exploit. According to analysis shared by Lookonchain, the attacker has already transferred approximately $5.5 million through a combination of instant swap services and centralized exchanges, including ChangeNOW, FixedFloat, KuCoin, and HTX. Routing funds through multiple channels suggests an attempt to obscure flows and accelerate laundering. A pattern commonly observed in recent wallet exploits. Despite the ongoing movement of stolen assets, Trust Wallet has moved quickly to reassure users. Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) publicly stated that Trust Wallet will fully cover all user losses resulting from the incident. This commitment has been central to calming concerns. Particularly given the wallet’s large global user base and the broader climate of weakened trust in crypto infrastructure. The Trust Wallet team later reinforced this position with a formal statement, confirming the scale of the impact and outlining next steps. “We’ve confirmed that approximately $7M has been impacted and we will ensure all affected users are refunded,” the team said. The team added that supporting affected users is the top priority, and they are actively finalizing the refund process. The statement also warned users to avoid interacting with messages that do not originate from official Trust Wallet channels. As fund tracking continues, the focus has now shifted from damage assessment to execution of reimbursements and restoration of user confidence. Altcoin Market Holds Key Support As Broader Structure Weakens The total cryptocurrency market capitalization excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum is trading near the $825 billion level on the weekly chart. Following a sharp pullback from the $1.1–$1.2 trillion highs reached earlier this year. This index, used as a proxy for broader altcoin market health, shows a clear loss of momentum after an aggressive expansion phase. Signaling rising stress across the altcoin sector. Technically, the market has slipped below its faster weekly moving average, which previously acted as dynamic support during the uptrend. That level has now flipped into resistance, limiting upside attempts. Price is currently hovering just above the longer-term moving averages, which converge between roughly $780 billion and $820 billion. This zone represents a critical structural support area. A sustained break below it would likely confirm a broader bearish transition for altcoins. Related Reading: Bitcoin and Ethereum Coinbase Inflows Collapse While Binance Retains Relative Activity – Details From a market-structure perspective, holding the current range keeps the possibility of consolidation alive. However, failure to defend this support would open the door to a deeper retracement toward the $650–$700 billion region. For a bullish case to re-emerge, the altcoin market would need to reclaim the $900 billion level and reestablish acceptance above its key moving averages.

This surge in the RWA sector can largely be attributed to the performance of specific platforms. Notably, Keeta Network has skyrocketed by 1,794.9% YTD, while Zebec Network and Maple Finance have recorded gains of 217.3% and 123.0% respectively. Related Reading: Bitcoin Correction Timeline: Analyst Predicts Potential Bottom In October 2026 Current statistics show that the crypto RWA sector boasts a Distributed Asset Value of $18.88 billion, reflecting a 2.56% increase over the past month. However, the Represented Asset Value has seen a slight decline, standing at $407.93 billion, down 2.36%. For context, RWA’s approach facilitates asset managers and projects the digital transformation of tangible assets, such as real estate and commodities, creating a solid foundation for trading, managing, and securing these assets. Layer-1 (L1) solutions have emerged as the second most profitable narrative this year, achieving an average price gain of 80.3% YTD. The success of this narrative can be attributed to the performance of privacy-focused blockchains such as Zcash and Monero, which have seen rallies of 691.3% and 143.6%, respectively. Another noteworthy crypto narrative, “Made in USA,” is also on track to end the year positively, with average gains of 30.6% YTD, primarily driven by Zcash’s performance that mitigated the moderate losses of other tokens in that category. Top Meme Tokens Suffer Heavy Losses Despite their popularity, narratives such as memecoins and artificial intelligence (AI) have struggled this year, with average returns of -31.6% and -50.2% year-to-date, respectively. Leading memecoins in the crypto space, such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), have demonstrated the volatility of this sector by suffering significant losses of over 60% year-to-date. Similarly, the report notes that many artificial intelligence-focused crypto assets have recorded declines between 49.8% and 84.3%, with only Alchemist AI and Kite performing relatively better.

The decentralized exchange (DEX) narrative has mirrored this decline with average losses of -55.5%, while layer-2 (L2) solutions have also struggled, recording average returns of -40.6% for the second year in a row. At the time of writing, the market’s leading crypto, Bitcoin (BTC), was trading at $88,960, having recorded losses of 10% year-to-date.

56429055,648973,1766804405,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56429055.jpeg,The State Of US Stablecoin Legislation: Unresolved Issues And Challenges,https://bitcoinist.com/us-stablecoin-legislation-issues-and-challenges/,"In a recent report, market expert Colin Wu shed light on the ongoing issues facing the cryptocurrency industry as a result of stablecoin legislation, notably the GENIUS Act, which was enacted in July under President Donald Trump’s administration. While this bill is viewed as a significant win for the digital asset market—anticipating increased adoption and utilization in the foreseeable future—it brings with it a host of complications that warrant attention. Wu Highlights Potential Risks In The GENIUS Act Wu’s analysis emphasizes that the GENIUS Act has led to heightened global demand for US dollars and Treasury securities, which, while bolstering the dollar’s international standing, has also inadvertently benefited the Trump family and associates linked to the crypto industry. However, this development has opened new challenges for the oversight of dollar flows globally and raises concerns about the stability of the traditional financial system in the United States. A notable concern is how the trading of crypto assets enabled by USD stablecoins has evolved into a complex and less observable method for the US to extract wealth worldwide. Wu asserts that this mechanism poses significant threats to the monetary sovereignty and financial security of other nations. The GENIUS Act outlines reserve asset categories like bank deposits, short-term Treasuries, and repo agreements. However, the fluctuating values of these assets can lead to potential insufficiencies in reserves, particularly if Treasury prices decline. How Stablecoin Laws May Undermine The Industry’s Foundations Wu also explained that addressing the challenges of fiat stablecoins, lawmakers are likely to instigate regulations affecting all crypto assets, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Real-World Assets (RWAs), since these assets rely heavily on stablecoins. Currently, licensed financial institutions cannot directly engage in trading, clearing, or custody of crypto assets due to the lack of legal recognition, leaving these opportunities to unregulated private firms. This scenario has reportedly led to higher profits for unregulated actors while increasing pressure on banks and the broader financial ecosystem. Consequently, this dynamic has prompted government authorities to hasten stablecoin regulation. Once crypto assets receive full legal recognition, banks are expected to step into the market completely. This shift would enable banks and payment institutions to tokenize deposits, allowing them to directly link deposit tokens with traditional financial elements. The overall trend in the US indicates a move toward a system where heavily regulated banks establish stability. This shift would reportedly facilitate the principle of “same business, same regulation,” leading to diminished risks for the monetary and financial structure. However, this transformation through stablecoin legislation may threaten the very foundation of the stablecoin industry itself. Wu concludes that in this context, it would be illogical for other nations to replicate the aggressive push for stablecoin development that the US has adopted.

In a recent post, he noted that Japan and South Korea are reportedly discussing potential collaboration on blockchain-related initiatives. Although details have not yet been officially disclosed, Kanzaki stated that progress in these discussions may have implications for XRP adoption across the region. Early Signals of Japan–South Korea Blockchain Coordination Kanzaki referenced growing cooperation between both countries in the digital asset sector. Japan and South Korea represent two of the largest technology and finance hubs in Asia, and conversations about shared blockchain frameworks suggest interest beyond experimentation. If formal structures are introduced, they could support payment systems, remittance infrastructure, and enterprise blockchain deployment, areas where Ripple technology is already active. 日本と韓国はブロックチェーンインフラの共同開発に着手しています。 これらの協議は現在非公開で行われていますが、その影響は非常に大きいものとなるでしょう。 XRP保有者は、今後の動向に細心の注意を払うべきです。これはリップルにとって大きな転機となるでしょう。 — Yuto (@yutokanzakireal) December 25, 2025 Regulatory Updates Could Strengthen Ripple’s Position in Japan A separate update highlighted by Kanzaki on December 2 indicated that Japan is preparing to introduce regulations that would allow Ripple Prime and Ripple Custody to operate within the country’s established digital asset compliance system. Clear guidance of this nature would make it easier for regulated financial institutions to integrate Ripple-based services, improving conditions for future institutional participation. These policy signals follow Ripple’s earlier strategic investment in both markets. In mid-2024, Ripple allocated a significant portion of its long-term one-billion-XRP program to the XRPL Japan and Korea Fund . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Funding was directed toward expanding major partnerships, supporting new projects on the XRP Ledger, providing investment to startups, and sponsoring developer and education initiatives. Ripple stated that the commitment could reach tens of millions of dollars, reflecting its interest in deepening regional adoption. Expanding Validator Activity in East Asia Growth is also visible at the network level. In South Korea, Infinite Block became an official validator, enabling corporate-grade XRP services under regulatory oversight. Meanwhile, Japan-based SBI VC Trade joined the validator ecosystem as well, reinforcing its position as one of Ripple’s strongest partners in Asia . Wider validator participation enhances resilience and institutional readiness across the XRP Ledger, which is important for markets that operate under strict compliance rules. Kanzaki believes the combination of government-level talks, upcoming regulatory clarification, Ripple’s regional investment program, and the increase in XRPL validator activity points to a meaningful shift in market readiness within Asia. For this reason, he suggests that XRP holders monitor developments closely, particularly as Japan and South Korea evaluate cooperative blockchain pathways. If progress continues, he argues that Ripple could secure a stronger role in future financial infrastructure discussions across the region.

Michael rejected claims that the current AI boom is driven by money looping between the same companies rather than real demand. Michael said the focus on a circular model ignores what he described as a global supply imbalance tied to hardware, energy, and infrastructure. “Circular is the incorrect way of looking at it,” Michael said during the conversation. “It’s a lot of companies working to address an imbalance that is distorting the globe.” CoreWeave believes physical limits is what is slowing AI hardware delivery “The primary constraint is a physical bottleneck associated with getting the most performant compute into the hands of the most cutting edge players,” Michael said. Michael added that this pressure reaches far beyond cloud firms and chip suppliers. Michael shared details from a recent conversation with a mining company executive, who he did not name, where the discussion focused on materials needed to build infrastructure. He said the mining executive explained that the strain goes two levels deeper into the supply chain, reaching raw metals and copper used to support AI systems. Michael said the mining executive made a direct request for cooperation across industries to increase output. “We need to work together as a group,” the executive told him. Michael said similar comments from leaders inside AI companies are often criticized as proof of a circular economy. “If I say that in the AI space, I get accused of being in a circular economy,” he said. “So that’s all I’ll say on the circular economy is, like, you do that by working together.” Concerns from critics have also focused on risk tied to debt and customer exposure. Some warn that if CoreWeave fails to refinance obligations or loses a major client, lenders could release large volumes of used GPUs into secondary markets, hurting prices and causing disruption. Michael addressed that scenario by pointing to demand trends instead. He said the growth he sees is fast and aggressive, not fragile. CoreWeave faces stock swings as demand from big tech stays intense Michael said CoreWeave sits at the center of rising demand because of its focus on parallel computing, which supports modern AI workloads. He said requests from large technology firms continue without pause. Since its IPO, CoreWeave’s stock has been wobbly, but Michael only pointed out that shares now trade near $90, compared with an IPO price of $40. Michael also addressed past reliance on Microsoft, which once accounted for 85% of company revenue, saying that exposure has dropped after active diversification. He claims that no single customer now makes up more than 30% of the backlog, urging investors to ignore short delays that draw heavy reactions, such as a data center opening pushed back by a week, which he said triggered “bedlam” from short term observers. Michael described the current phase as a macro super cycle driven by a move from sequential to parallel computing that opens access to far greater compute capacity. Michael said the challenges slowing delivery remain tied to policy limits, physical infrastructure, and energy access. “The reasons that you have challenges in delivering that compute is because of policy, because of physical infrastructure, because of energy,” he said. “You do that by working together.” Don’t just read crypto news.

Both TeraWulf and Cipher have landed multi-billion dollar contracts with Alphabet's Google Cloud and Amazon's AWS, driving projected revenue growth of 132% and 66% in 2026, respectively. Valuation multiples for both companies could expand to 21-22x 2026 revenues, implying 45-50% share price upside from current levels. Risks include TeraWulf’s higher leverage and the critical need for both companies to deliver on large-scale infrastructure commitments by 2026. Investment Thesis Next year is going to be a make-or-break year for crypto miners. The stagnation in Bitcoin’s price so far has cornered crypto miners into a difficult position of winding down operations of their GPU infrastructure while demonstrating a return on these compute assets at the same time. With the colossal proliferation of AI and HPC workloads, crypto miners have figured out that pivoting to AI will give them a 2x benefit—keeping the lights on in their GPU data centers while also raising their margin profiles. Even better, many crypto miners in 2025 scored massive deals with the big spenders, hyperscalers, and frontier LLM labs. All eyes turn to how crypto miners eventually deliver on these big deals in 2026—the year of AI reckoning for these crypto miners. TeraWulf ( WULF ) and Cipher Mining ( CIFR ) are two such crypto miners who also jumped on the crypto-to-AI pivot bandwagon in 2025. I had previously recommended a Buy rating on both these companies, and I continue to recommend a Buy rating on both of them. TeraWulf and Cipher Mining’s Unique Pivot To AI In the past couple of months, I initiated Buy ratings on TeraWulf and Cipher Mining, citing impressive dynamics engineered in their respective HPC deals. Unfortunately, markets soured on prospects of AI tailwinds since then, with many investors questioning the tenacity of these tailwinds. My view stands firm—that AI is a strong secular force that will positively impact those that invest with AI in mind, and the recent pullbacks in the market give valuations a much-needed respite from the excitement in AI. 2025 has definitely shown the appreciation markets have towards the changing nature of crypto miners’ pivot towards supporting global AI workloads. The operations of all crypto miners typically centered on working towards securing three main resources—GPU, data center infrastructure, and power to support their crypto mining operations. But the severe downturn in crypto this year, as seen in the price of Bitcoin, the mothership of all cryptocurrencies, has complicated the business model of crypto miners. This can be seen in the declining hash rate index, a closely watched yardstick for the crypto mining industry’s revenues. Exhibit A: Hash price index drops to record lows this year. (Hashrate Index) A declining hash rate index should have been alarming for the crypto mining industry because it indicates stress in the business environment for crypto miners along with risks to profitability. But in 2025, we also saw a strong divergence where stocks of crypto miner companies decoupled from Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), as seen below. Exhibit B: Crypto miner stocks represented by CoinShares’ Bitcoin Mining ETF decouples from the sluggish price of Bitcoin. (Seeking Alpha) With the volume of AI and HPC workloads surging, demand for compute has also skyrocketed. So far, hyperscalers had attempted to keep up with their need for compute by raising their capex budgets well beyond 50-60% CAGR rates. Exhibit C: Hyperscaler capex so far has surged to meet intense demand for compute. (bloomberg) But the intense scrutiny on the free cash flows of hyperscalers seen in the past 2-3 months will have surely put a lid on the days of 50-60% capex CAGR that is expected to slow down to just 25% by the end of this year . Faced with this conundrum of slowing capex along with rising compute needs, hyperscalers are increasingly going to crypto miners, who are in prime position to quickly scale data center capacity because most of the crypto miners already have contracts in place with their respective power companies and infrastructure providers to bring data center compute online. Of all the crypto miners who have been racing to score deals where they offer up their compute and power resources to hyperscalers in exchange for annualized subscriptions, TeraWulf and Cipher Mining stand out in the crypto miner complex. Both TeraWulf and Cipher Mining have only one major client in common, Alphabet’s Google Cloud via Fluidstack, which is not just a customer of TeraWulf and Cipher’s data center infrastructure. Google is also an investor in both these companies, clearly announcing its vested interest in TeraWulf and Cipher Mining. In TeraWulf’s case, Alphabet will lease >200 MW of critical compute capacity via Fluidstack, which is expected to bring in ~$10B in revenues over the next decade. TeraWulf recently secured all the necessary financing to help them start building out the capacity for Google and Fluidstack, putting them on track for capacity delivery by H2 2026. One of the reasons TeraWulf may have been successful in favorably securing financing to support the build-out is because Google is backstopping their partnership with TeraWulf. The backstop implies Google Cloud is guaranteeing TeraWulf a total of ~$3.2B in lease obligations. The backstop, along with Google’s ~14% stake in TeraWulf (as part of the deal), has helped the crypto miner in securing project finance. Cipher Mining’s partnership between Google Cloud and Fluidstack is almost the same, except Cipher Mining is offering up a total of 207 MW of capacity by January 2027 to Google/Fluidstack. In exchange, Alphabet is also investing 5.4% in Cipher Mining while backstopping the partnership by ~$1.73B. Analysts were expecting the Cipher’s HPC revenue to come in at ~$127M in 2026, significantly rising to ~$740M in 2027. Exhibit D: Cipher Mining’s revenue mix shifting in 2026 to HPC. (S&P Intelligence) That was before Cipher Mining announced another hyperscaler win with Amazon's ( AMZN ) AWS to deliver ~300 MW of capacity. The total deal is worth ~$5.5B over 15 years. As it now stands, Wall Street is projecting a 66% jump in Cipher’s 2026 revenues, while TeraWulf’s revenues are expected to rise 132%. Valuation Levels For Cipher and TeraWulf If investors look at both TeraWulf and Cipher Mining, they will see that both these companies are trading at forward revenue multiples of ~13-14x. On the face of it, it appears that TeraWulf would look more attractive due to TeraWulf’s 132% projections in 2026 revenues. Exhibit E: Cipher Mining’s 2026 revenue multiple vs TeraWulf’s 2026 revenue multiples. (yCharts) However, I believe that Cipher’s revenue expectations are not accurately capturing the company’s ~300 MW agreement with Amazon’s AWS. I estimate the AWS deal can add at least $50M, if not more, to Cipher’s HPC revenues, pushing up the growth rates in Cipher’s 2026 revenues. Previously, I had explained why I believe Cipher’s shares warrant a forward revenue multiple of ~21-22x. That provides scope for Cipher’s revenue multiple to expand by ~45% from current 2026 revenue multiples of 14.5x, implying ~45% upside in Cipher’s shares. For TeraWulf, we can assume a similar expansion in its multiples if we compare TeraWulf vs Cipher Mining. That does provide scope for revenue multiple expansion in TeraWulf from 13.5 to ~21-22x, implying upside of ~50% in TeraWulf’s shares. Risks & Other Factors To Note However, in TeraWulf’s case, investors must note the risk of TeraWulf’s capital structure as compared to Cipher Mining. TeraWulf has ~$711M in cash vs. $1.1B in debt. Compared to TeraWulf, Cipher Mining boasts $1.2B in cash and $1B in debt. This means Cipher trades at an impressive multiple to its book value of just 8x, while TeraWulf richly trades at a book value multiple of 21x. At a broader level, 2026 will also be the year that will test the level of commitments of crypto miners. Many crypto miners have moved quickly to secure agreements with hyperscalers in the last few months and are quickly working to honor these commitments to bring only many megawatts of compute infrastructure. If these commitments are not honored, crypto miners risk losing millions of dollars' worth of revenues as well as losing the credibility of their business plan to pivot to AI. Takeaway 2026 will be a crucial year for crypto mining companies, which have used 2025 to pivot to AI and HPC workloads. TeraWulf and Cipher Mining stand out as two mining companies that are well positioned to benefit from the industry pivot towards AI. I am reiterating my Buy rating on both TeraWulf and Cipher Mining and updating my PT above.",BTC-USD|AMZN|GOOG|WULF|CIFR,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-27 03:43:54

XRP Has Possibly Been Trading Inside A Symmetrical Triangle In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a Triangle that XRP has been trading inside on the 15-minute timeframe. A “Triangle” is a TA pattern that appears whenever an asset consolidates between two converging trendlines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply Overhang: 6.6 Million BTC Bought Above Current Price The upper line of the pattern tends to be a source of resistance, while the lower one that of support. An escape beyond either boundary usually signals a breakout in that direction. Triangles can be of a few different types based on the orientation of their trendlines. Triangles that have one line parallel to the time-axis fall in either the Ascending or Descending categories. The pattern is an Ascending Triangle when the upper level is the parallel line, while it’s a Descending Triangle if the consolidation range shrinks to a downside. When both trendlines approach each other at a roughly equal and opposite slope, the pattern formed is known as a Symmetrical Triangle. This is the case that’s relevant in the current discussion. In a Symmetrical Triangle, the consolidation shrinks in an exactly sideways manner. As an asset moves through this pattern, its range gets narrower until it compresses down to a single point around the midline. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Symmetrical Triangle that the 15-minute price of XRP has been traveling inside recently: As displayed in the above graph, the 15-minute XRP price retested the lower level of the Symmetrical Triangle on Christmas and found support at it. This could be a potential sign that the channel is holding for now. As mentioned earlier, any level of a Triangle not holding up can signal a continuation of trend in that direction. This means that a surge above the channel can be a bullish sign, while a fall under it a bearish one. For Ascending and Descending Triangles, it’s usually considered that they have a direction bias attached to them, with Ascending Triangles being more likely to lead to bullish breakouts, while Descending Triangles to bearish breakdowns. Related Reading: Bitcoin Extreme Fear Streak Extends To 13 Days On Christmas In Symmetrical Triangles, though, the two lines are roughly identical, just mirrored, so breakouts could be equally probable in both directions. As such, it’s hard to say where XRP might escape from this Symmetrical Triangle. As for what might be the magnitude of the move a breakout could lead to, the analyst has noted it could potentially be of 10%. This is based on the fact that breakouts from consolidation channels are considered to end up being of the same length as the distance between the trendlines. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $1.84, down 3.3% over the last week.

56431019,648982,1766808016,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56431019.jpeg,Japan’s FY2026 Reform To Reshape Crypto Assets Taxation System – Report,https://bitcoinist.com/japans-2026-reform-reshape-crypto-taxation-system/,"Japan’s upcoming tax reform is expected to restructure the way crypto assets are treated in the country next year, changing digital assets classification and introducing a separate taxation system for different transactions. Japan Proposes New Taxation System On Friday, local news media outlets shared key details of Japan’s upcoming FY2026 Tax Reform Outline, published by the Liberal Democratic Party and the Japan Innovation Party on December 19. CoinPost reported that the 2026 tax reform will introduce significant changes to current taxation system related to the classification and regulation of crypto assets, which have been long requested by Japanese investors. Notably, the plan has proposed classifying digital assets as financial products, which indicates a shift from their previous treatment as speculative assets. As a result, the reform is exploring the introduction of a separate taxation system to crypto income, similar to stocks and investment trusts. According to the report, separate taxation and comprehensive taxation may not cover the same transactions. Under the existing system, crypto gains are taxed as “miscellaneous income,” with rates reaching up to 55%. The regular taxation system and miscellaneous income reporting may still apply depending on the transaction type. The reform outlines that crypto spot trading, derivative transactions, and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) would be subject for the separate taxation system. However, there’s no specific mention of reward-based transactions like staking or lending, suggesting that the applicable income category and taxation method for these transactions will require future addressing. Its worth noting that taxation for these transactions is split between the time of acquisition and the time of sale. When crypto assets are received as a reward for activities like staking, it is valued at market price at the time of acquisition and taxed as miscellaneous income. If the rewards are sold later, the resulting capital gain is subject to additional taxation. Meanwhile, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) will likely remain subject to the comprehensive taxation, as the reform doesn’t explicitly mention them, suggesting that NFTs trading and similar activities could continue to be treated as miscellaneous income and fall under the comprehensive taxation. Tax Reform To Separate ‘Specified Crypto Assets’ The local news outlet also highlighted that the separate taxation system may apply only to limited cryptocurrencies, as the reform stipulates the new taxation and reporting system for crypto trading business “businesses based on the premise of ‘trading in specified crypto assets.’” This could suggest that the “specified crypto assets” mentioned in the tax reform outline may not include all digital assets , but could be limited to those within a certain institutionally defined scope. “Based on the outline’s wording, it is an important point to note that not all cryptocurrency transactions will uniformly fall under the new system; rather, a system design delineating a specific scope is likely to be implemented,” the report detailed. Moreover, the 2026 tax reform outlined a proposal to allows losses from crypto transactions to be eligible for carryforward deductions for up to three years, similar to FX and stock policies in Japan. The introduction of carryforward deductions is expected to make tax adjustments easier, as investors previously had to offset unrealized losses against gains in profitable years to reduce taxable income. Lastly, the report noted the potential introduction of an exit tax in the future. Under the current system, crypto assets are not subject exit tax upon leaving Japan. However, the reclassification as financial instruments under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act could open the door to a system where unrealized gains become taxable upon departure",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto classification|crypto framework|Crypto Staking|Crypto tax laws|japan authorities|Japan crypto legislation|Japan Crypto Tax|Japan crypto tax reform|nfts,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-27 04:00:16

Bitcoin Difficulty Has Crossed 148 Trillion Hashes 2025 is coming to a close, and it was a year where Bitcoin miners significantly expanded their facilities. According to data from Blockchain.com , the network Hashrate , a measure of the total amount of computing power connected by the miners, has seen its 7-day average value go from 795.7 terahashes per second (TH/s) at the start of the year to 1070.3 TH/s today. During this phase of growth, the Hashrate set multiple new records, with the final all-time high (ATH) of 1,151.6 TH/s coming in October. Since then, the metric has slowed down, but even with the decline to the current level, it remains about 34.5% up since January 1st. Bitcoin miner revenue mostly comes from the block subsidy, which remains fixed in BTC value outside of Halving events, so miners tend to be dependent on growth in the price for a boost in their income. This is why the Hashrate usually follows the price trend. From the chart, it’s visible that the Hashrate’s ATH came right after the top in the cryptocurrency and the pullback in the metric since then has also come alongside a drawdown in the price. Miners have been more resilient than the asset, however, as BTC is down year-to-date, while the Hashrate is still up notably. Growth in the Bitcoin Hashrate always results in an increase in another metric, called the Difficulty . The Difficulty is a feature baked into the blockchain’s code, controlling how hard miners would find it to discover the next block on the network. It automatically changes its value about every two weeks, based on how miners performed since the last adjustment. Satoshi set a standard block time of 10 minutes for the network to follow; if miners take an average period faster than this to add blocks, the chain increases the Difficulty. The exact degree of the upward adjustment is always just enough to counteract the speed increase of the miners. In other words, it balances out the jump in the Hashrate. As miners were in a phase of growth this year, Bitcoin had to repeatedly elevate its Difficulty, setting new ATHs in the process. Since setting a new record above 155 trillion hashes in October, the Bitcoin Difficulty has also witnessed a decline. Even so, the metric at its current value of about 148.2 is still 35% up compared to the 109.8 trillion hashes level from the start of the year. The growth in the Difficulty has been pretty similar to that in the Hashrate, a natural consequence of the former reacting to the latter. BTC Price Bitcoin saw recovery above $89,000 earlier, but it seems the rally couldn’t last as the asset is already back at $87,300.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin difficulty|bitcoin mining|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MINING|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-27 05:00:09

According to The Information, both startups had connected to JPMorgan through Checkbook, a U.S.-based payments company. But the association with high-risk jurisdictions set off alarm bells inside the bank. JPMorgan insists it’s not cracking down on stablecoins . “This has nothing to do with stablecoin companies,” a bank spokesperson allegedly said. “We bank both stablecoin issuers and stablecoin-related businesses, and we recently took a stablecoin issuer public.” Still, the startups’ activity in Venezuela triggered concerns tied to U.S. financial rules, especially sanctions enforcement. Banks like JPMorgan are required to know who they’re dealing with and where their money is coming from, or else the SEC will come knocking. Trump isn’t known to have a forgiving nature. Trump seizes tankers and calls Venezuela oil a U.S. asset While JPMorgan was shutting off access, President Donald Trump was going full steam ahead with new actions against Venezuela. 2 weeks ago, Trump’s administration has intercepted two tankers full of Venezuelan oil, with a third one now being tracked. Speaking to reporters, the president said, “Maybe we will sell it, maybe we will keep it. Maybe we’ll use it in the strategic reserves. We’re keeping the ships also.” At the center of the crackdown is Venezuela’s state oil company, PDVSA, already blacklisted under Executive Orders 13850 and 13884 since 2019. Trump’s Treasury department claimed in their official notice that oil sales are keeping Nicolás Maduro’s regime afloat. Earlier this month, they officially labeled fentanyl (which they allege flows through Venezuela) a “weapon of mass destruction.” The U.S. Treasury Department on December 11 sanctioned six shipping companies that have been moving oil out of Venezuela using shady location tactics and fake data transmissions. The first company is Myra Marine Limited, based in the Marshall Islands. Next is Arctic Voyager Incorporated, also from the Marshall Islands. Then there’s Poweroy Investment Limited, registered in the British Virgin Islands. Ready Great Limited, also from the Marshall Islands, was also sanctioned along with Sino Marine Services Limited, a UK-registered company that runs the TAMIA (IMO: 9315642), which was flagged in Hong Kong. Lastly was Full Happy Limited, also registered in the Marshall Islands, and its ship took on oil in late May and sent it to Asia.

This dramatic shift highlights the intense volatility and inherent risks within the derivatives sector. Data reveals a stark imbalance, with long positions—bets on rising prices—accounting for a staggering 91.39% of the total Bitcoin liquidations. This pattern, mirrored in Ethereum but inverted for assets like Zcash, provides a crucial window into current trader sentiment and market mechanics. Understanding these liquidations is essential for any participant in the digital asset ecosystem. Bitcoin Liquidations Dominate Market Activity The cryptocurrency perpetual futures market experienced concentrated selling pressure over a 24-hour period. Bitcoin (BTC), the market leader, saw total liquidations reach $47.32 million . The overwhelming majority of this figure, precisely 91.39%, stemmed from long positions being liquidated. Consequently, this indicates a rapid price decline triggered cascading margin calls. Simultaneously, Ethereum (ETH) followed a similar trend with $21.18 million in liquidations, where longs constituted 74.9%. In stark contrast, Zcash (ZEC) presented an inverse scenario. Its $5.52 million in liquidations were overwhelmingly dominated by short positions at 94.88%, suggesting a sharp, unexpected price rally caught bearish traders off guard. These events did not occur in a vacuum. They are directly tied to the structure of perpetual futures contracts, which use leverage. Traders borrow capital to amplify their positions, but this also amplifies risk. A relatively small price move against a highly leveraged position can trigger automatic liquidation by the exchange. Therefore, the high percentage of long liquidations for BTC and ETH strongly suggests a coordinated downward price movement that systematically wiped out over-leveraged bullish bets across major platforms. Asset Total 24h Liquidations Long Position % Short Position % Bitcoin (BTC) $47.32M 91.39% 8.61% Ethereum (ETH) $21.18M 74.90% 25.10% Zcash (ZEC) $5.52M 5.12% 94.88% Mechanics of Crypto Futures Liquidations To fully grasp the significance of this data, one must understand the engine behind it: the perpetual futures market. Unlike traditional futures with expiry dates, perpetual contracts trade indefinitely, using a funding rate mechanism to tether their price to the underlying spot market. The critical element here is leverage . Exchanges allow traders to open positions worth many times their initial collateral. While this can magnify profits, it also drastically lowers the price move required to wipe out that collateral, a point known as the liquidation price . When the market price hits a trader’s liquidation price, the exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses. This process sells the asset into the market, often creating a feedback loop. A wave of long liquidations creates additional sell pressure, potentially pushing the price lower and triggering more liquidations. This phenomenon, sometimes called a long squeeze or cascading liquidation, is a hallmark of crypto market volatility. The 91% long liquidation rate for Bitcoin is a textbook indicator of such an event, where bullish overconfidence met with a sharp corrective move. Historical Context and Market Maturity Comparing this event to historical precedents, like the major deleveraging in May 2021 or the FTX-induced collapse in November 2022, reveals a market growing in scale but still grappling with similar structural risks. However, the absolute dollar value of liquidations, while significant, is lower relative to total market capitalization than in previous cycles. This suggests improved risk management tools among institutional participants and possibly lower aggregate leverage ratios. Nonetheless, the data proves that retail and speculative segments remain highly vulnerable. Analysts from firms like Glassnode and CoinMetrics consistently warn that high funding rates and crowded long positions are reliable, though not perfect, contrarian indicators for short-term market tops. Divergent Patterns: BTC/ETH vs. ZEC The radically different liquidation profile for Zcash offers a compelling counter-narrative. A market where 94.88% of liquidations are short positions indicates a violent short squeeze . In this scenario, traders betting on a price decline (shorts) are forced to buy back the asset to close their positions as the price rises, fueling further upward momentum. This can occur due to unexpected positive news, a large buy order, or low liquidity in the asset’s trading pairs. ZEC’s lower market capitalization and trading volume make it more susceptible to such volatile, asymmetric moves compared to the deeper, more liquid markets of Bitcoin and Ethereum. This divergence underscores a key lesson for traders: market context is everything . While macro factors might drive BTC and ETH, smaller altcoins like ZEC can move on idiosyncratic developments or simple market mechanics. A trader must analyze: Funding Rates: Persistently high rates often precede long liquidations. Open Interest: A sharp drop alongside price movement confirms liquidations. Volume & Liquidity: Thinner markets exacerbate liquidation volatility. The simultaneous occurrence of a long squeeze in major assets and a short squeeze in a minor one illustrates the complex, multi-faceted nature of cryptocurrency market dynamics in 2025. Impact and Implications for Traders The immediate impact of such liquidation events is a rapid repricing of risk across the entire derivatives landscape. Following the event, exchanges often see a temporary reduction in available leverage offers as risk engines recalibrate. For traders, the aftermath presents both caution and opportunity. The flushing out of excessive leverage can create a healthier foundation for the next price move, potentially resetting overextended indicators. However, it also serves as a stark reminder of the non-linear risks associated with leveraged trading. Risk management strategies become paramount. Experts advocate for: Using lower leverage multiples, especially in volatile conditions. Setting stop-loss orders at logical technical levels, not just based on margin requirements. Diversifying away from highly correlated perpetual futures positions. Continuously monitoring aggregate market data like the estimated leverage ratio and liquidation heatmaps. Ultimately, these events reinforce that cryptocurrency markets, while maturing, are fundamentally different from traditional finance. Their 24/7 nature, high leverage accessibility, and global participant base can lead to accelerated and amplified price discovery mechanisms, with liquidation cascades being a primary transmission channel. Conclusion The $47.32 million in Bitcoin liquidations, overwhelmingly skewed toward long positions, provides a critical case study in modern market structure. This event underscores the powerful and often punishing role of leverage in the cryptocurrency perpetual futures market. While the scale highlights growing institutional depth, the pattern confirms that speculative excess remains a potent force. The contrasting example of Zcash further demonstrates how market mechanics can produce violently opposite outcomes in different assets. For the astute observer, these Bitcoin liquidations are not merely a record of losses but a valuable dataset. They reveal prevailing sentiment, pinpoint systemic risks, and offer hard lessons on the essential discipline of risk management in the digital asset age. As markets evolve, understanding these dynamics will separate informed participants from the merely speculative. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when a long position is liquidated? A long position is liquidated when a trader who borrowed money to bet on a price increase sees the market fall to a level where their initial collateral is exhausted. The exchange automatically sells their position to repay the loan, locking in a total loss of the collateral. Q2: Why were Bitcoin long liquidations so high (91%) compared to shorts? This typically occurs during a rapid price decline. A high concentration of traders using leverage had placed bullish bets, and the downward move triggered a cascade of automatic sell orders from their liquidations, amplifying the drop. Q3: How is a short squeeze, like with Zcash, different? A short squeeze happens when the price rises sharply, forcing traders who borrowed and sold an asset (betting on a drop) to buy it back at a higher price to close their position. This buying pressure can fuel an even sharper rally, which is what the 94.88% short liquidation rate for ZEC indicates. Q4: Can liquidation events predict future price direction? Not directly, but they can indicate market extremes. A massive long liquidation event can sometimes signal that excessive bullish leverage has been “flushed out,” potentially creating a short-term bottom. However, it does not guarantee a reversal. Q5: How can traders protect themselves from liquidation? Key strategies include using much lower leverage (e.g., 3-5x instead of 20-50x), depositing more collateral than the minimum required (lowering your liquidation price), using stop-loss orders, and avoiding highly leveraged trades during periods of high volatility or extreme funding rates.

A tweet from crypto enthusiast X Finance Bull draws focus to what is described as a subtle yet meaningful change within the XRP ecosystem. Instead of highlighting short-term trading activity, the commentary centers on infrastructure building, validator participation, and liquidity commitments tied to Evernorth, an institutional digital asset treasury company positioning itself around XRP. The message emphasizes that institutional involvement rarely begins with public excitement. It often starts with foundational steps that indicate long-term intent. In this case, Evernorth is portrayed not as an entity seeking quick returns, but as one aligning its operations with the core mechanics that support sustained network activity. The $XRP Quiet Shift Few Are Watching Institutional adoption doesn’t start loud. It starts with infra, validators, and real liquidity commitments. Just like Evernorth is doing. They’re not just buying $XRP , they’re building with it: adding yield protocols, running nodes,… https://t.co/noOLD85Gy8 pic.twitter.com/OoGC34qZin — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) December 23, 2025 Building, Not Just Holding According to the post, Evernorth’s approach goes beyond acquiring XRP for balance sheet exposure. The company is presented as actively developing yield strategies, operating nodes, and strengthening order books. These actions suggest a commitment to being part of the operational fabric of the ecosystem rather than remaining a passive holder. X Finance Bull highlights a form of institutional participation focused on durability. Yield protocols, liquidity provisioning, and validator roles are typically associated with entities that expect to remain engaged over extended periods. The implication is that such involvement embeds XRP deeper into institutional workflows , reinforcing its role in treasury management and market infrastructure. By stressing that this is not a fund attempting to benefit from short-term market cycles, the commentary positions Evernorth as signaling intent rather than speculation. The idea advanced is that value is moving quietly, with positioning taking place before broader regulatory or market changes draw wider attention. David Schwartz on Evernorth’s Role The video attached to the post features remarks from Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, who describes Evernorth as a new institutional participant focused specifically on XRP. He explains that the company is backed by major industry names, including SBI, Ripple, Pantera, and Kraken, and that it is raising capital primarily to purchase XRP on the open market as part of a dedicated institutional treasury strategy. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Schwartz notes that Evernorth is actively managing its holdings through yield generation and capital market activities, while also planning to participate directly in the network as a validator. He adds that the firm intends to provision liquidity and integrate with decentralized finance protocols, including those connected to RLUSD , reinforcing the view that Evernorth aims to contribute operationally rather than only financially. He further states that the company is expected to explore solutions within the XRP Ledger ecosystem to generate yield, making it a participant seeking practical use cases rather than merely reallocating capital. The post concludes by classifying Evernorth’s activities as part of a broader migration of value happening away from public attention. It suggests that institutions positioning themselves now may be preparing for future shifts in market structure and regulatory clarity.

This comprehensive analysis examines the technological, regulatory, and market dynamics that will shape XRP’s future value. XRP Price Prediction: Foundation and Current Market Context Ripple’s XRP operates fundamentally differently from many cryptocurrencies. Consequently, its valuation depends on unique utility factors. The digital asset primarily facilitates cross-border payments and liquidity solutions for financial institutions through RippleNet. Currently, XRP maintains its position among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This standing reflects both its established infrastructure and ongoing legal developments that have created significant market uncertainty in recent years. Market analysts consistently reference several core metrics when evaluating XRP. These include transaction volume on the XRP Ledger, adoption rates by banking partners, and the resolution of the longstanding SEC litigation. Furthermore, broader cryptocurrency market cycles and macroeconomic conditions heavily influence its price action. Historical data shows XRP often moves with market trends while also experiencing volatility from case-specific news. Critical Factors Influencing the 2026-2030 Forecast Several interconnected elements will determine XRP’s price path through the latter half of the decade. First, regulatory clarity remains paramount. The conclusion of Ripple’s legal proceedings with U.S. regulators will either remove a major overhang or impose new restrictions. Second, institutional adoption drives utility. Increased use of On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) by payment providers directly correlates with XRP demand. Expert Analysis and Quantitative Models Financial modeling firms and blockchain analysts employ various methodologies. Some use discounted cash flow models based on projected transaction fees saved by institutions. Others apply comparative analysis against traditional cross-border settlement costs. Notably, a 2024 report by the Blockchain Research Institute projected that capturing just 1% of the global remittance market could necessitate substantial XRP valuation growth. However, experts caution that linear projections often fail in cryptocurrency markets due to their inherent volatility and disruptive nature. Technological developments on the XRP Ledger also contribute significantly. Upgrades enhancing scalability, smart contract functionality via Hooks, and sustained low transaction costs could expand its use cases beyond payments. This expansion might include tokenized assets and decentralized finance applications, potentially creating new demand vectors. The $5 Question: Scenario Analysis and Probability The prospect of XRP reaching $5 represents a substantial increase from its historical trading range. Achieving this price point implies a market capitalization that would place it among the most valuable digital assets globally. Analysts typically outline three primary scenarios for evaluation. Bullish Scenario: Requires full regulatory resolution favoring Ripple, accelerated global ODL adoption, and a sustained cryptocurrency bull market. In this case, $5 becomes plausible by 2029-2030. Base Case Scenario: Assumes gradual regulatory normalization and steady institutional growth. This path suggests a more moderate climb, potentially reaching between $2.50 and $3.50 by 2030. Conservative Scenario: Envisions ongoing regulatory challenges and slower-than-expected adoption. This could limit significant price appreciation, keeping XRP below the $2 threshold through the decade. Historical resistance levels and on-chain data provide additional context. The $1.50 to $2.00 range has acted as a major psychological and technical barrier multiple times in XRP’s history. A sustained break above this zone would be a critical technical milestone for any long-term rally toward higher targets. Comparative Market Position and Risk Assessment XRP does not exist in a vacuum. Its performance relative to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other payment-focused cryptocurrencies like Stellar Lumens will impact investor perception and capital flows. Moreover, the rise of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) presents both a competitive threat and a potential interoperability opportunity for Ripple’s technology. Key risks extend beyond regulation. Market concentration remains a concern, with a significant portion of XRP held by Ripple Labs itself. The company’s escrow release schedule therefore directly influences circulating supply. Additionally, technological competition is fierce. New blockchain networks offering similar speed and cost advantages emerge regularly, challenging XRP’s first-mover status in institutional payments. Conclusion Predicting XRP’s price through 2026-2030 involves synthesizing complex regulatory, technological, and market signals. While a path to $5 exists under optimal conditions involving full regulatory clarity, massive adoption, and favorable macro trends, it represents an ambitious target requiring multiple aligned factors. Investors should focus on verifiable adoption metrics, regulatory developments, and overall market health rather than speculative price targets. The coming years will ultimately test Ripple’s value proposition in an increasingly crowded and sophisticated digital asset landscape. FAQs Q1: What is the most important factor for XRP’s price growth by 2030? The single most critical factor is clear, favorable regulatory treatment, particularly in the United States and other major economies, which would unlock institutional adoption. Q2: How does Ripple’s escrow of XRP affect the price prediction? The scheduled escrow releases manage supply inflation. Predictable, transparent releases can reduce selling pressure uncertainty, while unexpected changes to the schedule could create volatility. Q3: Can XRP reach $5 without Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs? While possible, it is statistically unlikely. Historically, major altcoin rallies have correlated strongly with Bitcoin strength, as it drives overall market liquidity and sentiment. Q4: What role does banking adoption play in the XRP price prediction? Direct banking use of ODL creates tangible buy-side demand for XRP as a bridge asset. Increased transaction volume from this use case is a fundamental driver of long-term value, not just speculation. Q5: How do predictions for 2026 differ from those for 2030? 2026 predictions are more sensitive to immediate regulatory outcomes and current adoption cycles. 2030 forecasts incorporate longer-term technological integration, potential new use cases, and broader macroeconomic shifts. Q6: Are historical XRP price patterns reliable for future predictions? While technical analysis provides context, cryptocurrency markets evolve rapidly. Past performance, especially pre-2020, may not fully account for today’s institutional involvement and regulatory frameworks, limiting its predictive power.

This decision marked a significant legislative victory that helped alleviate tensions that had arisen earlier between the libertarian leader and his close friend. Sources close to the situation revealed that the manner in which the senators approved Milei’s budget plan was conducted in a general session, with a vote of 46-25. Actually, reliable sources confirmed that this move marks the first time in history since Milei assumed the role of Argentina’s president in 2023. Milei’s 2026 budget plan is set to act as a game-changer for Argentina’s economy Following Milei’s victory , reports mentioned that the voting results demonstrated that several parties agreed with the details in the budget plan. However, despite the proposal being submitted to the Senate and later approved, it is worth noting that Milei faced a significant challenge in Congress following his win in the midterm election. Even with this discovery, several analysts still argued that this scenario presented a great opportunity for the president to showcase his commitment to fostering development in the country and boosting Argentina’s economy . In the meantime, lawmakers have made it clear that they plan to thoroughly examine the labour reform submitted by Milei in February of next year. This budget discussion will provide individuals with an indication of what to expect in the future. What makes the president’s labour reform bill unique is that it enables Milei’s administration to provide debt abroad, apart from typically addressing fiscal policy issues. This takes place under a law from his predecessor that requires approval from Congress to permit foreign bond sales or deals with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Regarding this statement, a recently released financial report highlighted that Argentina has approximately $4.5 billion in debts to bondholders as of January 9. Immediately after the publication of this finding, reporters contacted the current Minister of Economy of Argentina, Luis Caputo, for comment on the claim. Respondingly, Caputo alleged that the government had not yet adopted any plans to sell new bonds overseas in January as a strategy to assist in settling some of these payments. As uncertainties surround the country’s financial conditions in Argentina, several analysts have acknowledged that securing the budget plan’s approval enhances the country’s $20 billion deal with the IMF as 2026 approaches. Hence, assisting Milei in acquiring a fiscal surplus. Concerning the tensions raised earlier between Argentina’s president and some of his other close friends, sources with knowledge of the situation revealed that Milei fueled existing tensions with his friends during the budget process early on. At this particular moment, he attempted to make some adjustments to the funding model for universities and disability initiatives. Notably, the centrist groups expressed their disapproval of these efforts this year. Ultimately, lawmakers in the lower house gave Milei’s budget a green light by eliminating references to these two issues. Argentina faces a market decline impacting its economic growth This month, the relevant authorities in Argentina published the country’s economic data. According to the released data, the country experienced unexpected economic growth despite a market downturn that occurred just before the midterm elections. According to reports from the national statistics agency, Argentina’s economic activity surged by 3.2% in October compared to the same month last year. This growth was lower than the previously estimated 4.2% average, indicating the first decline since June. Month-to-month, this decline was noted to have decreased by 0.4%. Other factors that contributed to this growth were the activities that took place during the period leading up to the October election. For instance, Argentine voters selected half of the lower house of Congress and a third of the Senate in late October. As the election drew nearer, investors expressed growing concern that Milei would not succeed, given his major loss in a local election held in September. This loss led to significant fluctuations in the local financial markets. Moreover, the Argentine peso experienced a decline of around 5% in value during that month.

Perhaps even more importantly for investors who had amassed impressive quantities of the native token, PI also went live for trading. The initial days were quite promising. It skyrocketed to a few consecutive all-time highs, the latest being at the end of February at almost $3.00. However, the hype quickly disappeared, and PI entered a prolonged bear market of its own with just a few deviations and brief spikes. Overall, the asset lost more than 94% of its value by early October when it crashed to an all-time low of $0.172. After some project updates and promising news from the team, it managed to recover some ground and has remained above $0.20 for the past couple of months. Despite the ongoing market uncertainty among all digital assets, PI has maintained a price tag above $0.20, which is a crucial support level. The question is, what will happen in the final week of 2025? Recovery or Breakdown? To get a further perspective on the matter, we asked some of the most popular AI solutions. We will start with ChatGPT, which believes PI is showing some signs of stabilization, but its overall structure remains fragile. It noted that Pi Network’s native token is fundamentally and structurally different than most larger-cap altcoins. The current $0.20 region has acted as a “consistent survival zone,” as the bulls have stepped up every time the asset approached it. However, if it’s broken to the downside, which would be possible if a more violent overall market correction takes place, then the all-time low will come into focus. In contrast, PI might be able to challenge the first immediate resistance at $0.22-$0.24 if buyer activity picks up as it did in late October and November. The Bigger Concerns Gemini and Perplexity outlined a more worrisome bear case, in which PI not only loses the $0.20 support but also crashes below the ATL. Such a vicious nosedive is on the table due to the declining trading volumes and PI’s inability to stage a more permanent comeback. Additionally, repeated tests of the $0.20 support often weaken it over time, which could lead to another breakdown, especially if BTC and the altcoins face another sell-off at the end of the year. In conclusion, the three AIs agreed that PI survived the October/November crash “better than expected,” but its resilience is now being tested again. The $0.20 support will determine how it ends the year. A solid hold might lead to a mild holiday recovery, while a decisive breakdown could lead to a $0.172 retest.

The cryptocurrency market continues its evolution, with Cardano (ADA) remaining a focal point for investors analyzing long-term potential. This analysis provides a detailed, evidence-based Cardano price prediction for 2026 through 2030, specifically examining the feasibility of its native token, ADA, reaching the significant $2 milestone. We will dissect technological developments, macroeconomic factors, and historical data patterns to build a comprehensive outlook. Cardano Price Prediction: Foundation and Methodology Constructing a reliable Cardano price prediction requires a multi-faceted approach. Analysts must consider both on-chain metrics and broader market forces. Consequently, this forecast integrates quantitative data with qualitative assessments of Cardano’s roadmap. The blockchain’s unique proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, Ouroboros, provides a fundamental advantage in energy efficiency. Furthermore, its peer-reviewed development philosophy under Input Output Global (IOG) aims for high assurance and security. Market sentiment, however, often reacts to upgrade deployments and adoption milestones. For instance, the successful implementation of the Alonzo hard fork introduced smart contract capability, a pivotal moment for the network’s utility. Therefore, future price trajectories will likely correlate with the execution of the Basho phase, focused on scaling, and the Voltaire phase, which introduces governance. Key Analytical Pillars for ADA Valuation Several core pillars support any long-term ADA valuation model. First, network adoption metrics like Total Value Locked (TVL) in decentralized applications (dApps) and daily active addresses offer direct utility signals. Second, developer activity on the platform, measured by GitHub commits and project launches, indicates ecosystem health. Third, macroeconomic conditions , including interest rate environments and regulatory clarity, heavily influence capital flows into digital assets. Finally, competitive positioning against Ethereum, Solana, and other smart contract platforms dictates market share. A balanced analysis weighs all these factors without speculative hype. ADA Price Trajectory: 2026 Outlook and Key Drivers The year 2026 represents a critical medium-term horizon for Cardano’s price prediction. By this time, the full rollout of major network upgrades like Hydra for layer-2 scaling should be operational. This scalability solution aims to process thousands of transactions per second. Increased throughput could catalyze broader enterprise and institutional adoption. Moreover, the maturation of the Cardano DeFi and NFT ecosystems will be essential. If real-world use cases in supply chain, digital identity, and education gain traction, demand for ADA could rise substantially. Historical volatility patterns in cryptocurrency also suggest that 2026 may follow a potential market cycle peak in late 2025. Therefore, price action may reflect a consolidation or correction phase, establishing a new support level from which to build. Factor Potential Bullish Impact Potential Bearish Impact Hydra Scaling Significantly lower fees, higher TPS Technical delays or complexities DeFi Growth Increased TVL and user activity Competition from other L1s Regulatory Clarity Institutional investment inflows Restrictive policies hindering growth The 2027 Forecast: Assessing Sustainable Growth Moving into 2027, the Cardano price prediction hinges on sustainable ecosystem growth. The network’s governance model under Voltaire should be fully functional, decentralizing treasury and proposal voting to ADA holders. This could enhance network resilience and community alignment. Analysts often project prices based on discounted cash flow models adapted for crypto, considering staking yield as a form of dividend. With an estimated 2-3% of total supply staked annually, ADA offers a yield-generating aspect. Widespread adoption in emerging markets for financial inclusion projects could also drive unique demand. However, technological obsolescence remains a constant risk in the fast-paced blockchain sector. Continuous innovation and developer retention are paramount for Cardano to maintain its relevance against next-generation platforms. Expert Perspectives on Long-Term Viability Industry experts emphasize utility over pure speculation. Charles Hoskinson, Cardano’s founder, consistently highlights the project’s research-driven approach for long-term sustainability. Meanwhile, analysts from firms like Messari and Coin Bureau point to on-chain data as the ultimate truth teller. They note that while price predictions are inherently uncertain, metrics like network revenue, fee capture, and developer growth provide concrete health indicators. For ADA to approach $2, its market capitalization would need to grow substantially from current levels, implying a significant increase in either token price, circulating supply, or both. This growth must be underpinned by tangible economic activity on the chain, not merely trading volume. 2030 Vision: Can Cardano Realistically Reach $2? The question of ADA hitting $2 by 2030 is a central theme for long-term holders. Achieving this price point depends on a confluence of favorable conditions. First, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization would likely need to expand significantly, with Cardano capturing a maintained or increased share. Second, the successful implementation of its entire roadmap, creating a robust, scalable, and widely-used blockchain, is non-negotiable. Third, global macroeconomic stability and progressive regulatory frameworks would facilitate mainstream adoption. It is a target within the realm of possibility, but it is not guaranteed. It requires the network to transition from a promising platform to a foundational piece of global digital infrastructure. Comparative analysis with Ethereum’s growth trajectory provides a useful, though not definitive, framework. Critical Success Factors for $2 ADA: Mass adoption of Cardano-based digital identities. Dominance in specific verticals like education credentialing. Seamless interoperability with other major blockchains. A thriving, self-sustaining dApp ecosystem with daily utility. Conclusion This Cardano price prediction for 2026, 2027, and 2030 illustrates a path defined by technological execution and market adoption. The journey for ADA to reach $2 is challenging and depends on the network realizing its ambitious scalability and governance goals. While short-term volatility will persist, the long-term thesis for Cardano rests on its methodical, peer-reviewed build-out and growing real-world utility. Investors should focus on fundamental milestones and on-chain metrics rather than price speculation alone. The coming years will be decisive in determining whether Cardano secures a leading position in the decentralized future. FAQs Q1: What is the most important factor for Cardano’s price increase by 2026? The most critical factor is the successful deployment and adoption of scaling solutions like Hydra, which would enable high-throughput, low-cost applications and attract users and developers. Q2: How does Cardano’s staking mechanism affect its long-term price prediction? Staking provides a yield, incentivizing holding and reducing sell-side pressure. A high percentage of staked ADA indicates long-term holder confidence, which can contribute to price stability and gradual appreciation. Q3: What are the biggest risks to this Cardano price prediction? Key risks include intense competition from other smart contract platforms, potential security vulnerabilities, significant delays in roadmap execution, and adverse global regulatory changes impacting the entire crypto sector. Q4: Could ADA hit $2 before 2030? It is possible in a scenario of extreme bullish market cycles and accelerated Cardano adoption. However, a steady, fundamental growth trajectory aligned with technological milestones makes the 2028-2030 timeframe a more common analytical projection. Q5: Where can I find reliable data to track Cardano’s progress? Reliable data sources include Cardano blockchain explorers like CardanoScan, analytics platforms such as Messari and IntoTheBlock, and the official Essential Cardano development update repository published by IOG.

He reiterated that the token could rise to $7,000 or even as high as $9,000 in early 2026 and eventually reach $20,000 in the years to come. Speaking on the Power Lunch episode, he explained that Wall Street’s push to tokenise everything would play directly into Ethereum’s strengths. He said, “It will bring use cases forward for Ethereum.” Lee had claimed Ethereum could surpass Bitcoin Lee stated that the overall crypto market will continue to hold up well for the next five to ten years, even as Bitcoin continues to work through its “gold envy” phase and the fallout from liquidation. Next year, he predicts, the top crypto asset will bounce back and reach an all-time high of $200,000, while Ethereum may peak at $ 9,000. Earlier this month, in November, the Fundstrat founder had argued that Ethereum would eventually dominate the cryptocurrency space, overtaking prominent names such as Bitcoin. He claimed the network’s extensive developer ecosystem and technical resilience set it apart structurally. He added, “I think it’s a true robust community with actual known values, and it’s a neutral blockchain with 100% uptime.” Even then, he maintained that institutional tokenization would contribute to the growth of the network, the claim being that if big institutions hold back from rolling out round-the-clock tokenized equity offerings into the network, others will catch up without delay. At the time, he also said that the token could range between “$7,000–$9,000” by the end of January 2026, blaming the asset’s then decline on the October 10 crypto market crash. Crypto analyst Christopher Perkins had supported Lee’s remarks, affirming that more institutions are turning to the network and tokenisation. He also said most firms will likely prioritize risk management, uptime, and security for their blockchain of use. Sharplink’s Chalom says Ethereum’s TVL could increase ten times in 2026 On Friday, Sharplink’s co-CEO, Joseph Chalom, also shared a more bullish outlook on Ethereum, predicting that its total value locked will grow tenfold in 2026, following the growth of institutions and applications that join the pool. Typically, a rise in TVL indicates increased network participation and hints at potential price implications. Currently, the network’s TVL stands at approximately $68 billion, and with about 797,704 ETH holdings, Sharplink Gaming now ranks as the second-largest public Ethereum treasury firm. Chalom also projects that the stablecoin market will reach $500 billion by the end of next year. He asserted that the crypto community can expect an increasing use of global stablecoins, including cross-border remittances, retail payments, and institutional transactions, with Ethereum becoming the fundamental settlement layer for value movement. Furthermore, he anticipates that more large players will enter the market next year. He added that tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) could surpass $300 billion by 2026, largely due to heightened engagement from major asset managers and banks, including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Franklin Templeton, and BlackRock. Moreover, he said sovereign wealth funds will increase their ETH holdings by five to ten times as tokenisation increases, and Ethereum remains the trust foundation for most blockchain innovation. Most wealth funds favour the network for its “ubiquity and time-tested nature,” he contended. He also believes more onchain AI agents and prediction markets will be integrated on mainstream platforms, increasing network activity and TVL in 2026.

However, some analysts have suggested that the cryptocurrency’s bleeding may not be over and a move to lower levels looms. Related Reading: Bitcoin Poised For ‘Boring’ 2025 Close – Here’s When BTC’s Real Test Will Come Dogecoin Chart Signals Short-Term Caution On Friday, Dogecoin saw another 4.2% intraday decline to from the $0.126 area amid the ongoing market volatility. The cryptocurrency has retraced over 50% from the early October highs, losing multiple key support zones in the past two months. After losing the $0.135 level nearly two weeks ago, DOGE has been the $0.120-$0.135 price range, failing to break past the range’s high despite various attempts. Now, the largest memecoin by market capitalization is attempting to hold the crucial $0.120 support zone to prevent further bleeding. Therefore, some market observers have advised caution during the last week of the year. In an X post, analyst More Crypto Online affirmed that Dogecoin “is still a falling knife” as it appears that its corrective move is not done yet. “There’s no evidence that wave B has bottomed,” he explained, which suggests that a 20% drop toward the next key supports, the $0.096 and $0.08 levels, could be likely. Per the post, “Caution is recommended until the price shows a first micro 5-wave move to the upside.” Similarly, analyst Crypto Jobs warned that investors should stay cautious as Dogecoin does not display a bullish reversal structure and has weak buying volume, unlike multiple other altcoins. He explained that momentum is bearish despite holding the key $0.12 level, adding that, as long as DOGE’s price stays under the $0.14-$0.15 area, bulls won’t be in control and the bearish set up and downtrend structure will remain intact. No buy pressure at the moment, without volume. No bull structure… Under the main downtrend & channel, seeing another dump toward the $0.100 – $0.09500 lower support looks realistic. Sideway phase ongoing on the short term [H4 outlook]. We may also see some bullish move before a possible next wave downward. DOGE’s Price Breakdown Imminent? Market watcher BitGuru considers that DOGE’s deep correction is completed. He pointed out that the cryptocurrency is currently sitting in a major demand zone, between the $0.120-$0.130 levels, where liquidity has already been swept. Based on this, he forecasted that a reclaim of the late November levels could set the stage for a recovery rally toward the $0.18 resistance. On the contrary, failing to hold the current levels would hint that Dogecoin will continue in a prolonged consolidation phase. Meanwhile, Trader Tardigrade highlighted that the cryptocurrency’s price has reached the target of its previous symmetrical triangle pattern after breaking down from the formation earlier this month. Related Reading: More Pain For Ethereum? Head And Shoulder Pattern Signals $2,400 Breakdown Now, Dogecoin is forming a new pattern and “searching for a new trend,” he added. According to the trader, DOGE has been forming another symmetrical triangle pattern on the H4 chart over the past two weeks, which could resolve in a 15% move toward a bearish or bullish trend. Notably, Friday’s pullback sent the cryptocurrency below the pattern’s lower boundary, which sits around the $0.123 mark, signaling that a drop toward the $0.10-$0.11 area is possible if price doesn’t bounce soon. As of this writing, Dogecoin trades at $0.122, a 7.3% decline in the weekly timeframe.

Instead of opening with price targets or technical analysis, the focus is placed on a wide market shift that could define the next phase of the cycle. According to the analyst, the current behavior of silver and gold offers an early clue to what may eventually unfold across Bitcoin and the crypto market, including XRP. Silver and Gold Signal an Overheated Phase CryptoBull highlights that precious metals are displaying characteristics of an aggressive late-stage rally. The attached chart of silver shows a steep advance, with prices pushing toward the upper end of the displayed range near the $70 level per ounce. Silver is showing us what a blow off top looks like. So does gold. Bitcoin and crypto in general is behind. The biggest part of the #XRP gains are still ahead of us! pic.twitter.com/RoOqZFexv0 — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) December 23, 2025 Gold, in the analyst’s view, is exhibiting a similar pattern. This kind of rapid acceleration is interpreted as a sign that capital has heavily concentrated in metals, driving prices higher at a pace that often precedes exhaustion. Rather than viewing this as a warning for metals alone, CryptoBull presents it as evidence of where liquidity is currently flowing. The implication is that when one segment of the market reaches such an advanced stage, attention and capital may eventually rotate elsewhere. Bitcoin and Crypto Still Playing Catch-Up In contrast, Bitcoin and the broader crypto market are described as lagging behind this move. The accompanying Bitcoin chart shows BTC trading around the mid-$80,000 region after pulling back from recent highs, suggesting consolidation rather than the kind of vertical advance seen in silver. For CryptoBull, this gap is meaningful. It suggests that digital assets have not yet experienced the same late-cycle surge that precious metals appear to be undergoing. From this perspective, the current underperformance is not viewed as a weakness but as an indication that crypto may still have room to run once liquidity begins to shift away from metals. XRP Positioned for Its Strongest Phase A central part of CryptoBull’s outlook is XRP . The analyst argues that most of XRP’s gains in this cycle are still ahead, implying that the asset has yet to enter its most decisive upward phase. Within the broader narrative, XRP is presented as a beneficiary of a future rotation, where capital moves from overheated markets into lagging ones. This view aligns XRP with the idea that timing matters as much as direction. If metals are indeed nearing an advanced stage, XRP’s opportunity may lie in what comes next rather than what has already occurred. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Liquidity, Patience, and the Longer View An additional comment from X user Mariwen reinforces the analyst’s view. Mariwen notes that liquidity is presently concentrated in precious metals, which naturally leaves crypto trailing for a period. From this standpoint, there is no urgency to chase short-term moves. Instead, patience is emphasized, with the belief that those who endure through the quieter phases are better positioned for the eventual shift. Together, these perspectives present a coherent narrative: precious metals are leading, crypto is waiting its turn, and XRP may be among the assets with the most ground still to cover when that turn arrives.

This comprehensive examination explores evidence-based Bitcoin price predictions for 2026 through 2030, drawing from historical patterns, technological developments, and macroeconomic indicators that shape cryptocurrency valuations. Bitcoin Price Prediction Methodology and Historical Context Analysts employ multiple methodologies when forecasting Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Historical price action provides crucial context, particularly regarding Bitcoin’s four-year halving cycles. The 2024 halving reduced mining rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC per block, historically triggering supply shock effects approximately 12-18 months later. Consequently, many predictions for 2026 consider this delayed impact alongside growing institutional participation. Traditional financial models increasingly incorporate Bitcoin analysis. For instance, stock-to-flow models compare Bitcoin’s circulating supply against annual production. Meanwhile, network value metrics assess user adoption rates and transaction volumes. These quantitative approaches combine with qualitative factors like regulatory developments and technological upgrades to form comprehensive forecasts. Institutional Adoption as a Primary Catalyst Major financial institutions have significantly increased Bitcoin exposure since 2023. Spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in multiple jurisdictions created new investment pathways. BlackRock, Fidelity, and other asset managers now offer Bitcoin investment products to traditional investors. This institutional infrastructure development suggests sustained demand growth through 2026 and beyond. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2026: Post-Halving Maturation Phase The year 2026 represents a critical period in Bitcoin’s development cycle. Historical data indicates that post-halving bull markets typically peak 12-18 months after halving events. Therefore, 2026 could represent either the latter stages of a bull market or the beginning of consolidation, depending on broader economic conditions. Several factors will influence Bitcoin’s 2026 price trajectory: Macroeconomic environment: Interest rate policies and inflation trends significantly impact risk assets Regulatory clarity: Clearer cryptocurrency regulations could enhance institutional participation Technological developments: Layer-2 solutions and privacy enhancements may increase utility Global adoption metrics: User growth in emerging markets provides demand indicators Analysts reference previous cycles while acknowledging unique contemporary factors. The 2016-2017 bull market saw approximately 100x growth from cycle lows, while the 2020-2021 cycle produced roughly 20x gains. More moderate growth percentages appear likely for future cycles as Bitcoin’s market capitalization expands. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2027-2028: Network Effect Acceleration The 2027-2028 period may demonstrate Bitcoin’s evolving role in global finance. Increasing integration with traditional financial systems could drive price discovery through new mechanisms. Central bank digital currency developments might create Bitcoin interoperability opportunities or competitive pressures. Network effects become increasingly significant during this period. Metcalfe’s Law suggests a network’s value grows proportionally to the square of its users. Bitcoin’s user base expansion, particularly in regions experiencing currency instability, could drive substantial valuation increases. Additionally, Lightning Network adoption for everyday transactions might enhance Bitcoin’s utility beyond store-of-value applications. Bitcoin Adoption Metrics Comparison 2023-2028 Projections Metric 2023 Baseline 2028 Projection Active Addresses ~1 million daily ~3-5 million daily Institutional Holdings ~3% of supply ~8-12% of supply Payment Integration Limited merchant adoption Major retail chains accepting Layer-2 Transactions Thousands daily Millions daily Technological Infrastructure Development Bitcoin’s underlying technology continues evolving through community-driven improvements. Taproot upgrades enhanced privacy and smart contract capabilities. Future protocol developments might address scalability challenges while maintaining decentralization principles. These technological advancements could increase Bitcoin’s utility and consequently its valuation. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2029-2030: Maturation and Mainstream Integration The 2029-2030 timeframe represents Bitcoin’s potential transition toward mainstream financial asset status. By this period, Bitcoin will have completed approximately five halving cycles, providing substantial historical data for analysis. Previous cryptocurrency market patterns suggest potential stabilization as adoption reaches critical mass. Several scenarios could unfold during this period: Global reserve asset status: Bitcoin might function as digital gold in national reserves Inflation hedge validation: Decades of data could confirm Bitcoin’s inflation resistance Technological obsolescence concerns: Quantum computing or superior technologies might emerge Regulatory harmonization: International cryptocurrency standards could develop Demographic factors also influence long-term predictions. Younger generations show greater cryptocurrency acceptance than older cohorts. As wealth transfers between generations, cryptocurrency allocations within investment portfolios might increase substantially. This intergenerational shift could drive sustained demand through 2030. Environmental and Social Considerations Bitcoin mining’s energy consumption remains a significant discussion point. However, mining increasingly utilizes renewable energy sources and stranded power. By 2030, Bitcoin mining might achieve carbon neutrality through technological innovations and regulatory requirements. This environmental progress could remove a major barrier to institutional adoption. Comparative Analysis with Traditional Assets Bitcoin’s performance relative to traditional assets provides important context for predictions. Since its inception, Bitcoin has significantly outperformed major stock indices, commodities, and bonds on annualized return metrics. However, this outperformance comes with substantially higher volatility. Portfolio theory suggests optimal Bitcoin allocations between 1-5% for risk-adjusted returns. As Bitcoin’s volatility potentially decreases with market maturation, optimal allocations might increase. Institutional portfolio managers increasingly recognize Bitcoin’s diversification benefits despite correlation fluctuations with traditional assets. Risk Factors and Prediction Limitations All cryptocurrency price predictions contain inherent uncertainties. Several risk factors could substantially alter Bitcoin’s trajectory: Regulatory interventions: Hostile regulatory environments in major economies Technological vulnerabilities: Critical protocol flaws or security breaches Market structure risks: Exchange failures or liquidity crises Macroeconomic shocks: Global financial crises or monetary system changes Competitive pressures: Superior cryptocurrency or digital asset emergence Prediction models acknowledge these uncertainties through scenario analysis rather than precise price targets. Responsible analysis presents ranges and probabilities rather than definitive predictions, emphasizing that cryptocurrency investments carry substantial risk. Conclusion Bitcoin price predictions for 2026 through 2030 reflect both optimism and caution based on evolving evidence. The cryptocurrency’s trajectory will likely depend on continued institutional adoption, technological development, regulatory clarity, and macroeconomic conditions. While historical patterns provide guidance, Bitcoin’s unique characteristics ensure an unpredictable journey. Investors should approach long-term Bitcoin price predictions with careful research, risk management, and awareness of cryptocurrency’s inherent volatility. The coming years will test Bitcoin’s resilience and potentially solidify its position within global financial systems. FAQs Q1: What factors most influence Bitcoin’s long-term price predictions? Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory depends primarily on adoption rates, regulatory developments, macroeconomic conditions, technological advancements, and institutional participation levels. Network security and hash rate stability also contribute significantly. Q2: How reliable are Bitcoin price prediction models? Prediction models provide probabilistic scenarios rather than guarantees. While historical patterns and quantitative models offer insights, cryptocurrency markets remain influenced by unpredictable technological, regulatory, and macroeconomic developments. Q3: Does Bitcoin’s halving cycle guarantee price increases? Historical data shows correlation between halving events and subsequent price appreciation, but causation isn’t guaranteed. Previous cycles occurred within different macroeconomic contexts and adoption stages, limiting predictive certainty. Q4: What percentage of investment portfolios might include Bitcoin by 2030? Financial advisors increasingly recommend 1-5% cryptocurrency allocations for diversified portfolios. By 2030, institutional adoption could push average allocations toward the higher end of this range, depending on volatility reduction and regulatory clarity. Q5: How might quantum computing affect Bitcoin’s long-term value? Quantum computing could potentially threaten Bitcoin’s cryptographic security. However, the Bitcoin development community actively researches quantum-resistant solutions, and any transition would likely occur gradually with community consensus.

This article explores whether KAS is set to lead a new trend and highlights other coins poised for potential growth. Readers will gain insights into what sets KAS apart during these stagnant times. Kaspa (KAS) Eyes Potential Comeback with Recent Price Action Source: tradingview Kaspa's price currently hovers between a little over $0.042 and just under $0.050. It is flirting with its short-term resistance level of $0.052. If it breaks past this, the next target could be close to six cents, an increase of around 20% from its current upper price range. Although it has seen a drop of over 10% in the past month, recent weekly gains of nearly 12% show signs of a potential uptrend. Its RSI indicates it's neither overbought nor oversold, which suggests balanced market conditions. Kaspa's price is sticking close to its 10-day moving average, hinting at stability and a possible bounce back. Conclusion KAS maintains its position while the broader crypto market shows signs of hesitation. This steady performance suggests potential for continued growth. In contrast, other cryptocurrencies remain in a holding pattern, indicating potential volatility ahead. Assessing KAS's stability in comparison to other coins reinforces optimism for its future trajectory. The trend is aligned with market anticipation, suggesting that KAS's current strength might lead to further upward movement. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

These standout cryptos are defying the trend and catching the eye of investors. This article dives into which coins are poised for potential growth despite the overall slump, offering a glimpse into market opportunities that can't be ignored. Monero (XMR): Privacy-Driven Gem Poised for The Next Altcoin Wave Monero (XMR) stands out as a top choice for privacy-conscious users. It was created in 2014, focusing on anonymous transactions by hiding sender, receiver, and transaction amounts. This privacy edge gives it an advantage as digital freedom becomes a bigger concern. The tech behind XMR makes tracking movements near impossible, protecting users from prying eyes. As we anticipate a new bull run and altcoin season, Monero's constant improvements and strong community make it attractive. Demand for privacy is rising, which positions Monero well in this cycle. It's a coin to watch for future gains. Litecoin: Set to Shine Bright in the Upcoming Altcoin Season Litecoin , often dubbed the silver to Bitcoin's gold, is a seasoned player in the crypto space. With faster transaction times and a robust network, LTC might be ready for the limelight again. Its longevity in the market shows its staying power. The coin uses a technology similar to Bitcoin but offers quicker confirmation times, making it a useful payment option. In this current market dip, Litecoin's strong fundamentals could make it a standout choice for investors looking for altcoins with potential. As patterns from 2021 suggest, altcoin seasons follow Bitcoin dumps, positioning Litecoin as an attractive option in this cycle. UNI Could Shine Bright in the Upcoming Altcoin Season Uniswap's UNI token could be a star performer in the next altcoin season. Uniswap is a popular decentralized exchange built on the Ethereum platform. It allows users to swap various cryptocurrencies without needing a centralized authority. This makes it a favorite among crypto enthusiasts who value privacy and transparency. Despite recent market downturns, history suggests that UNI often rises stronger afterward. Its technology and easy user experience could drive higher adoption and demand. If the market turns bullish again, UNI’s unique features and strong user base could make it an attractive choice for investors looking to capitalize on the new cycle. Conclusion XMR, LTC, and UNI have shown strength despite the overall market's weakness. These coins have managed to perform well where others have struggled. This resilience indicates potential for further growth and stability. It is crucial to keep an eye on them as they navigate through the current market conditions. Their performance might offer interesting opportunities for those looking to invest in stable options during these times. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While volatility once felt like part of the game, user expectations have shifted. Today, speed and predictability matter more than speculation — and that’s where stablecoins and instant payouts are changing everything. More players now prefer to bet with USDT, not because it’s trendy, but because it removes friction. Stable value, faster settlement, and clearer bankroll control are quietly redefining how modern crypto betting platforms operate. Why Stablecoins Became Central to Crypto Betting Bitcoin introduced decentralized betting. Stablecoins made it practical. For a long time, crypto betting meant accepting price swings as part of the experience. A winning bet could lose value within minutes, especially during volatile markets. Stablecoins removed that uncertainty. This shift didn’t happen overnight, but the logic is simple: when the value of your balance stays the same, decision-making improves. Bettors focus on odds, timing, and strategy — not on whether their winnings will still be worth the same tomorrow. That’s why USDT sports betting has grown faster than any other crypto betting segment. What Actually Changes When You Bet With USDT? At first glance, betting with USDT looks identical to betting with Bitcoin or Ethereum. But the experience feels different almost immediately. Here’s how the flow typically works on a modern USDT betting site: You deposit a stablecoin with a fixed value You place bets without worrying about market swings Winnings are settled instantly in the same currency Withdrawals arrive with no conversion delays That stability removes mental overhead. It also makes bonuses, cashback, and promotions easier to understand — a small but important detail for active bettors. Instant Payouts: From Advantage to Expectation There was a time when “fast withdrawals” were used as a marketing hook. That time is gone. In crypto betting today, instant payouts are not impressive — they’re expected. Stablecoins make this possible at scale. Because USDT transactions are liquid, predictable, and supported across multiple networks, platforms can automate settlement without manual checks. This matters most in live betting, where timing is everything. If a platform delays payouts in a stablecoin environment, users notice immediately. How Stablecoins Are Reshaping Sports Betting Infrastructure Stablecoins don’t just benefit users. They change how sportsbooks are built internally. With USDT betting, platforms can calculate odds more precisely, manage liquidity without volatility buffers, and offer fixed-value cashback programs. The result is a smoother system that reacts faster during peak events. This is one reason many newer crypto sportsbooks are designed around stablecoins first — and volatile assets second. Dexsport and the Shift Toward Stablecoin-First Betting One platform that illustrates this shift clearly is Dexsport . Dexsport integrates stablecoins directly into its sportsbook and casino ecosystem. Users can place bets, receive bonuses, and withdraw winnings in USDT across multiple networks — without KYC barriers or conversion risk. What stands out here is not just speed, but consistency. Cashback is paid in stablecoins. Live betting settlements preserve value. Cash Out decisions lock in exact amounts rather than fluctuating estimates. For users who want to bet with USDT and keep full control over their funds, this approach feels closer to decentralized finance than traditional gambling. Are Stablecoins Actually Safer for Crypto Betting? This question comes up often — and the answer depends on what “safer” means. Stablecoins reduce price volatility, but they don’t eliminate platform risk. Security still depends on licensing, custody, and transparency. What stablecoins do offer is clarity. When users always know the exact value of their balance, risk becomes easier to manage. In practice, that clarity builds confidence — especially for frequent bettors. Mobile Crypto Betting and Stablecoins Stablecoins also pair naturally with mobile crypto betting. On smaller screens, simplicity matters. Fixed balances are easier to track, payouts are easier to verify, and live betting decisions feel more intuitive. This is why many USDT betting platforms prioritize mobile web experiences with direct wallet interaction rather than complex native apps. What This Shift Means Going Forward Crypto betting is moving toward a new baseline: stablecoin-first liquidity instant settlement as standard wallet-based control over funds Volatility-driven betting won’t disappear, but it’s no longer the default. Platforms that integrate stablecoins deeply — rather than as an afterthought — are setting the pace. Final Thoughts Stablecoins and instant payouts aren’t just new features. They are reshaping how crypto betting works at a fundamental level. For players, betting with stablecoins offers stability and speed. For platforms, it enables automation and trust. And for ecosystems like Dexsport, it creates a betting experience where value stays predictable — even when the game isn’t. In the next phase of crypto betting, stability isn’t a limitation. It’s the foundation.",More News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-12-27 06:22:35
56436179,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=254582,1766816710,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio Reveals Critical Market Equilibrium Across Top Exchanges,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/btc-perpetual-futures-ratio-analysis/,"BitcoinWorld BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio Reveals Critical Market Equilibrium Across Top Exchanges Global cryptocurrency markets on March 15, 2025, witnessed a remarkable equilibrium in Bitcoin derivatives trading as the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio across the world’s three largest exchanges settled at an almost perfect balance, signaling sophisticated market maturity and providing crucial insights for institutional and retail traders navigating volatile conditions. BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio Analysis The 24-hour BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio data reveals a market in near-perfect equilibrium. Across Binance, OKX, and Bybit, the aggregated position ratio shows 49.49% long positions versus 50.51% short positions. This remarkable balance indicates neither bulls nor bears have established clear dominance in current market conditions. Market analysts consider this equilibrium particularly significant given Bitcoin’s recent price volatility and the growing institutional participation in cryptocurrency derivatives markets. Perpetual futures contracts represent one of the most popular cryptocurrency derivatives products. Unlike traditional futures with expiration dates, perpetual futures continue indefinitely with funding rates periodically exchanged between long and short positions. The long/short ratio therefore serves as a crucial sentiment indicator, revealing trader positioning and potential market direction. When analyzed across multiple exchanges, this data provides a comprehensive view of global market sentiment rather than exchange-specific anomalies. Exchange-Specific Breakdown and Market Implications Detailed examination of individual exchange data reveals subtle variations in trader behavior across platforms. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, shows the most balanced ratio at 50.34% long versus 49.66% short. This near-perfect equilibrium on the largest platform suggests institutional traders may be employing sophisticated hedging strategies rather than taking directional bets. OKX demonstrates the most pronounced bearish tilt among the three exchanges with 48.15% long positions against 51.85% short positions. Meanwhile, Bybit shows a similar but slightly less pronounced bearish bias at 48.92% long versus 51.08% short. These variations likely reflect different user demographics, regional trading patterns, and platform-specific features influencing trader behavior. BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio Comparison Exchange Long Positions Short Positions Net Bias Binance 50.34% 49.66% Slightly Bullish OKX 48.15% 51.85% Bearish Bybit 48.92% 51.08% Bearish Aggregate 49.49% 50.51% Neutral/Slightly Bearish Several factors contribute to these exchange-specific variations: User demographics: Different exchanges attract distinct trader profiles Regional concentration: Geographic distribution affects trading patterns Leverage options: Varying maximum leverage influences position sizing Funding rate mechanisms: Slight differences in how exchanges calculate funding Historical Context and Market Evolution The current equilibrium represents a significant evolution from earlier cryptocurrency market cycles. During the 2021 bull market, long/short ratios frequently showed extreme bullish biases exceeding 70% long positions. Conversely, during major corrections, short positions sometimes dominated at similar extreme levels. The current balanced ratio suggests several market developments: First, increased institutional participation has brought more sophisticated risk management practices to cryptocurrency markets. Professional traders frequently employ delta-neutral strategies and hedging that naturally balance long and short exposure. Second, regulatory developments in major jurisdictions have encouraged more measured positioning rather than speculative extremes. Finally, the maturation of cryptocurrency derivatives products has provided traders with more tools to express nuanced views rather than simple directional bets. Technical Analysis and Trading Strategy Implications From a technical analysis perspective, balanced long/short ratios often precede significant price movements. When neither bulls nor bears dominate positioning, markets become particularly sensitive to new information and catalysts. Traders monitor several key indicators alongside the long/short ratio: Funding rates: The periodic payments between long and short positions Open interest: Total value of outstanding derivative contracts Liquidations: Forced position closures at specific price levels Volume patterns: Trading activity supporting price movements Current funding rates across major exchanges remain relatively neutral, typically ranging between -0.01% and 0.01% per eight-hour funding period. This neutrality suggests neither side faces excessive funding costs that might force position unwinding. However, traders remain vigilant for funding rate spikes that could indicate growing positioning imbalances. Risk Management Considerations for 2025 The balanced BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio carries important risk management implications. First, balanced positioning reduces the likelihood of cascading liquidations that occur when extreme positioning meets adverse price movements. Second, neutral sentiment often precedes volatility expansion as markets seek catalysts for directional movement. Third, the equilibrium suggests options markets might offer attractive pricing for volatility strategies rather than directional bets. Seasoned derivatives traders often interpret balanced ratios as opportunities for range-bound strategies while preparing for potential breakout scenarios. Many employ options strategies like straddles or strangles that profit from significant price movement in either direction. Others implement dynamic hedging approaches that adjust exposure based on changing ratio data and other sentiment indicators. Regulatory Environment and Institutional Adoption The 2025 cryptocurrency regulatory landscape significantly influences derivatives trading patterns. Recent regulatory clarity in several major jurisdictions has encouraged more institutional participation while implementing safeguards against excessive leverage and position concentration. Key regulatory developments affecting BTC perpetual futures markets include: Enhanced reporting requirements for large positions Leverage limits in certain jurisdictions Improved custody solutions for institutional participants Standardized risk disclosure requirements across platforms These developments have contributed to more measured positioning compared to previous market cycles. Institutional participants, now representing approximately 45% of Bitcoin derivatives volume according to recent industry reports, typically employ more balanced approaches than retail traders during earlier bull markets. Their participation has increased market depth while reducing extreme sentiment swings in positioning data. Conclusion The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio across Binance, OKX, and Bybit reveals a cryptocurrency derivatives market achieving unprecedented equilibrium in early 2025. This balanced positioning reflects market maturation, increased institutional participation, and evolving regulatory frameworks. While individual exchanges show slight variations in trader sentiment, the aggregate data indicates neither bulls nor bears have established clear dominance. Market participants should interpret this equilibrium as evidence of sophisticated risk management rather than indecision, while remaining prepared for potential volatility expansion as new catalysts emerge. The BTC perpetual futures market continues evolving toward greater efficiency and institutional integration, with long/short ratios serving as crucial indicators of this ongoing transformation. FAQs Q1: What does the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio indicate about market sentiment? The ratio shows nearly balanced positioning between bullish and bearish traders, suggesting neither side has established clear dominance. This equilibrium often indicates sophisticated risk management and can precede increased volatility as markets seek directional catalysts. Q2: Why do long/short ratios vary between different cryptocurrency exchanges? Variations result from differences in user demographics, regional concentrations, leverage options, and platform-specific features. Institutional-heavy platforms often show more balanced ratios than retail-dominated exchanges during certain market conditions. Q3: How do perpetual futures differ from traditional futures contracts? Perpetual futures lack expiration dates and use funding rate mechanisms to maintain price alignment with spot markets. Traditional futures have set expiration dates and settle based on predetermined settlement procedures at contract maturity. Q4: What trading strategies work well during balanced long/short ratio conditions? Range-bound strategies, volatility plays using options, and dynamic hedging approaches often perform well during balanced conditions. Many traders implement strategies that profit from volatility expansion rather than directional bets during such periods. Q5: How has institutional participation affected BTC perpetual futures markets? Institutional involvement has increased market depth, improved liquidity, and encouraged more sophisticated risk management. Professional traders often employ hedging strategies that contribute to more balanced long/short ratios compared to earlier retail-dominated market cycles.

While thousands of platforms now advertise themselves as the best cryptocurrency casino, only a smaller group can actually explain how they protect player funds, verify outcomes, and operate under clear legal frameworks. In 2026, security in a cryptocurrency online casino is no longer about flashy bonuses or massive game counts. It comes down to three fundamentals: licensing, custody, and fair play. Miss one of them, and trust starts to crack. This guide breaks down what real security looks like in modern crypto casinos , how different platforms approach it, and why some models are clearly more resilient than others. What Makes a Cryptocurrency Casino Truly Secure? Security in crypto gambling is layered. There is no single checkbox that turns a casino into a safe one. A secure casino with cryptocurrency typically combines several elements at once: A valid gambling license with defined operating rules Clear custody logic showing who controls user funds Transparent game mechanics and settlement processes Operational maturity under real user load Here’s the question many players don’t ask early enough:Is a large game library still valuable if custody and transparency are unclear? In practice, security failures usually happen after a win — not during gameplay. That’s why the underlying structure matters more than surface features. Licensing in Cryptocurrency Casinos — What It Really Guarantees Licensing is often misunderstood in the crypto casino space. A license does not make a platform “risk-free,” but it does create accountability. Most established cryptocurrency online casinos operate under international licenses such as Curaçao or Anjouan. These jurisdictions allow crypto gambling while enforcing baseline standards. What licensing typically provides: Defined ownership and operator responsibility Published rules for bonuses and withdrawals A formal framework for handling disputes What it does not guarantee: Instant payouts in every situation Zero risk for players Protection from poor bankroll management In other words, licensing sets the floor — not the ceiling. Custody Models — Who Actually Controls Your Funds? Custody is where crypto casinos differ most from traditional platforms. At a high level, there are three common models: Fully custodial casinosUser funds are stored and controlled entirely by the platform. Hybrid custody platformsDeposits are held by the casino, but withdrawals are automated and faster. Wallet-first or non-custodial modelsUsers retain direct control through wallets or on-chain settlement logic. The third model is becoming more common in cryptocurrency casino integration, especially among platforms built natively for Web3 users. It reduces counterparty risk but also shifts responsibility to the player. Security improves — but only if users understand how wallets and transactions work. Dexsport — A Security-First Approach to Crypto Casino Design Among modern crypto casinos, Dexsport represents a wallet-first, transparency-driven model focused on minimizing trust assumptions. Instead of relying on heavy account systems, Dexsport allows instant access through: email or Telegram sign-up DeFi wallets such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet No routine KYC is required, and user funds move directly through blockchain networks. This approach reduces custodial exposure and shortens the path between wager and settlement. From a security standpoint, Dexsport combines: official licensing under the Government of the Autonomous Island of Anjouan independent smart contract audits on-chain bet logging with public visibility This structure does not eliminate risk — but it makes the rules visible. And visibility is the foundation of trust in any best cryptocurrency online casino. Different Security Models in Practice: How Major Platforms Compare Security in crypto casinos isn’t standardized. Each platform emphasizes different trade-offs. Stake — Scale and Operational Maturity Stake relies on reputation, liquidity, and long-term operational history. Its custodial model is offset by fast withdrawals, strong provider partnerships, and a large user base that stress-tests systems daily. Security here comes from scale and consistency rather than decentralization. Wild.io — Rewards Within a Traditional Framework Wild.io follows a more classic crypto casino structure, combining licensed operation with provably fair games and a generous bonus system. Custody remains centralized, but withdrawals are processed quickly, and the platform benefits from well-established game providers. BetMode — On-Chain Transparency as a Core Feature BetMode pushes security toward verifiability. Results are recorded on-chain, rakeback is calculated in real time, and users can observe how outcomes are generated. This model appeals to players who prioritize transparency over sheer game volume. Each approach works — but for different types of users. Fair Play in Crypto Casinos — From RNG to On-Chain Verification Fair play is more than random number generators and third-party certificates. Traditional crypto casinos rely on: certified RNGs game provider audits internal settlement systems More advanced platforms move toward: provably fair mechanics on-chain bet records verifiable outcomes visible to users Transparency doesn’t remove risk — it removes blind trust. This distinction matters most in live games and high-volume betting, where confidence in settlement logic becomes just as important as the game itself. Live Casino Security — When Real Dealers Enter the Picture Security requirements change in a cryptocurrency live casino. Live games introduce: video streaming integrity real-time result transmission latency-sensitive settlement Key factors that affect trust in live casino environments include: reputation of live game providers stream reliability and delay clear rules for result confirmation Here, platform stability matters as much as cryptography. Mobile Access and Security in Crypto Casinos The rise of the cryptocurrency mobile casino adds another layer of complexity. Most platforms now favor secure mobile web access over native apps. This allows: direct wallet signing fewer attack surfaces faster updates without app store delays However, mobile access also increases phishing risks, making user awareness part of the security equation. Where Secure Cryptocurrency Casinos Are Heading The future of crypto casinos isn’t about more games — it’s about clearer systems. Expect to see: deeper on-chain settlement better custody UX fewer opaque mechanics more visible verification tools Security is shifting from promises to architecture. Final Thoughts A secure cryptocurrency casino is defined by how it handles trust — not how loudly it markets bonuses. Licensing creates accountability. Custody defines risk. Fair play builds confidence. Platforms that align all three stand out as long-term players in the crypto gambling space.

The question of whether ETH can reach $10,000 represents more than mere speculation—it requires examining fundamental blockchain developments, institutional adoption patterns, and macroeconomic factors that will shape cryptocurrency valuations through the coming decade. Ethereum Price Prediction: Analyzing the 2026 Landscape Market analysts project Ethereum’s 2026 price based on several converging factors. First, Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake consensus has fundamentally altered its economic model. The network now burns a portion of transaction fees through EIP-1559, creating deflationary pressure during high-usage periods. According to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, Ethereum’s net issuance turned negative multiple times during 2024 network congestion events. Second, institutional adoption continues accelerating. BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF approval in 2024 marked a watershed moment. Major financial institutions now allocate portions of their digital asset portfolios to ETH. This institutional demand creates substantial buying pressure that could support higher price floors through 2026. Third, layer-2 scaling solutions have achieved remarkable adoption. Arbitrum, Optimism, and emerging zero-knowledge rollups collectively process over 80% of Ethereum transactions while settling finality on the main chain. This scalability breakthrough enables Ethereum to support thousands of transactions per second without compromising decentralization—a critical requirement for mass adoption. Technical Foundations: Ethereum’s 2027 Infrastructure Evolution The Ethereum roadmap outlines several crucial upgrades scheduled for 2026-2027. The Verkle trees implementation will enable stateless clients, dramatically reducing hardware requirements for node operators. Meanwhile, proto-danksharding will increase data availability for rollups by approximately 16 times. These technical improvements address current network limitations while enhancing Ethereum’s competitive position against alternative layer-1 blockchains. Real-world asset tokenization represents another significant growth vector. Major financial institutions including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have launched tokenization platforms built on Ethereum. These platforms convert traditional assets like treasury bonds, real estate, and commodities into blockchain-based tokens. As this sector expands through 2027, Ethereum could capture substantial value from the multi-trillion dollar traditional finance market. Expert Perspectives on Market Dynamics Cryptocurrency research firm Delphi Digital emphasizes Ethereum’s network effects in their 2025 annual report. Their analysis notes that Ethereum’s developer community remains approximately 3.5 times larger than its nearest competitor. This developer advantage creates powerful network effects that compound over time. Additionally, Ethereum’s total value locked in decentralized finance protocols has consistently maintained a 55-60% market share despite intense competition. University researchers from MIT and Stanford published a joint study in 2024 examining blockchain adoption curves. Their mathematical models suggest that if Ethereum maintains its current growth rate in daily active addresses and transaction volume, its network value could increase proportionally. However, these researchers caution that regulatory developments represent the most significant unknown variable affecting all cryptocurrency price predictions. The $10,000 Threshold: 2028-2030 Projection Analysis Reaching $10,000 per ETH requires careful examination of market capitalization mathematics. At current circulating supply levels, this price point would represent approximately a $1.2 trillion market capitalization. For context, gold’s total market value exceeds $12 trillion while global equity markets surpass $100 trillion. Ethereum capturing 1% of gold’s market value would comfortably support a $10,000 price target. Several scenarios could drive Ethereum toward this valuation. First, decentralized social media platforms built on Ethereum could achieve mainstream adoption by 2029. Projects like Farcaster demonstrate how blockchain-based social networks can operate without centralized control. If these platforms attract hundreds of millions of users, they would generate substantial ETH demand for transaction fees and governance participation. Second, central bank digital currency integration might emerge as a significant catalyst. Several central banks have experimented with wholesale CBDCs using Ethereum-based infrastructure. The Bank for International Settlements published a 2024 report detailing how Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities could facilitate cross-border CBDC settlements. Such institutional adoption at the sovereign level would validate Ethereum’s technological robustness while introducing new demand sources. Comparative Blockchain Performance Metrics Metric Ethereum (2024) Projected (2028) Transactions per Second 15-45 (base layer) 100,000+ (with rollups) Daily Active Addresses 400,000-600,000 2,000,000+ Annual Revenue $2.7 billion $15-20 billion Staked ETH Percentage 25% 40-50% This table illustrates Ethereum’s growth trajectory based on current network trends and announced upgrades. The projected metrics assume successful implementation of roadmap elements and continued adoption across key sectors. Risk Factors and Market Considerations While optimistic projections exist, several risk factors warrant consideration. Regulatory uncertainty remains the most significant concern. The SEC’s classification of Ethereum continues evolving, with potential implications for trading accessibility. Additionally, quantum computing advances could theoretically threaten Ethereum’s cryptographic foundations by 2030, though development teams actively research quantum-resistant algorithms. Competition from alternative layer-1 and layer-2 solutions presents another challenge. Solana, Cardano, and emerging blockchain platforms continue innovating with different technical approaches. Ethereum must maintain its development pace to preserve its first-mover advantages. The ecosystem’s response to these challenges will significantly influence long-term price trajectories. Macroeconomic conditions inevitably affect cryptocurrency valuations. Historical data shows correlation between Ethereum’s price and traditional risk assets during certain market periods. Federal Reserve policies, inflation rates, and global economic growth will impact investor risk appetite through 2030. Diversified investment portfolios typically allocate only modest percentages to cryptocurrencies, limiting potential capital inflows during risk-off environments. Conclusion Ethereum price predictions for 2026-2030 require balancing technological progress with market realities. The path to $10,000 depends on multiple factors aligning favorably: continued protocol improvements, expanding real-world use cases, supportive regulatory frameworks, and sustained institutional adoption. While mathematical models suggest this price target remains plausible within the timeframe, investors should consider Ethereum’s fundamental strengths alongside inherent cryptocurrency market volatility. The blockchain’s evolution from smart contract platform to global settlement layer will ultimately determine whether ETH achieves and sustains five-figure valuations through the decade’s end. FAQs Q1: What is the most realistic Ethereum price prediction for 2026? Most analysts project Ethereum trading between $6,000 and $8,500 in 2026, assuming continued adoption of layer-2 solutions and moderate growth in decentralized applications. These predictions consider current network fundamentals and historical growth patterns. Q2: How does Ethereum 2.0 affect long-term price predictions? The complete transition to proof-of-stake consensus reduces Ethereum’s energy consumption by approximately 99.95% while introducing staking rewards. This environmental improvement addresses institutional ESG concerns while creating predictable yield opportunities that could support higher valuations through 2030. Q3: What percentage of cryptocurrency portfolios should include Ethereum? Financial advisors typically recommend 1-5% allocations to cryptocurrencies within diversified portfolios, with Ethereum often representing 40-60% of that crypto allocation. However, individual risk tolerance and investment horizons significantly influence appropriate percentages. Q4: Can Ethereum reach $10,000 before Bitcoin reaches $100,000? Market dynamics suggest these milestones could occur within similar timeframes. Ethereum’s $10,000 target represents approximately a 3x increase from 2024 highs, while Bitcoin’s $100,000 represents roughly a 2x increase. Both targets depend on similar macroeconomic and adoption factors. Q5: What are the biggest threats to Ethereum’s price growth through 2030? Primary threats include regulatory crackdowns in major markets, successful competition from alternative layer-1 blockchains, security vulnerabilities in smart contracts or core protocol, and prolonged cryptocurrency bear markets driven by macroeconomic conditions.

Short-term momentum indicators are improving, suggesting the potential for a relief rally, though the broader trend remains under pressure. Powered by Outset PR , this analysis reflects the agency’s commitment to strategic, data-backed communication for the crypto industry. SOL Defends Multi-Tested Support Source: coinmarketcap SOL recently rebounded from the $118–$120 support zone, an area that has been tested multiple times since November. The repeated defense of this range suggests sellers are losing momentum, reducing downside pressure in the near term. This base has become structurally important, acting as a launch point for short-term recovery attempts rather than a breakdown trigger. Bullish Divergence Emerges on Lower Timeframes Momentum indicators on the 4-hour chart point to improving conditions. The Relative Strength Index formed a bullish divergence, with momentum strengthening despite prior lower price action. At the same time, the MACD histogram has turned positive, signaling a shift in short-term momentum. Together, these signals support the case for a relief rally, particularly if price action confirms the move with follow-through. Resistance Levels Define the Upside The immediate resistance zone sits between $132 and $136. A clean break above this range would strengthen the bullish case and open the path toward the $145 level. A key confirmation to watch is sustained closes above $130. Without this, upside attempts risk fading into another consolidation phase. How Outset PR Leverages Data-Driven Approach in Crypto PR Outset PR connects market events with meaningful storytelling through a data-driven methodology rarely seen in the crypto communications space. Founded by PR strategist Mike Ermolaev, the agency approaches each campaign like a hands-on workshop—building narratives that align with market momentum instead of relying on generic coverage or templated outreach. Beyond just monitoring on-chain flows, Outset PR monitors the media trendlines and traffic distribution through the lens of its proprietary Outset Data Pulse intelligence to determine when a client’s message will achieve the highest lift. This analysis informs the choice of media outlets, the angle of each pitch, and the timing of publication. A key part of the agency’s workflow comes from its proprietary Syndication Map , an internal analytics system that identifies which publications deliver the strongest downstream syndication across aggregators such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square. Because of this approach, Outset PR campaigns frequently achieve visibility several times higher than their initial placements. Outset PR ensures that each campaign is market-fit and tailored to deliver maximum relevance at the moment the audience is most receptive. Solana Price Outlook Solana shows signs of seller exhaustion near a well-established support zone, with bullish divergence supporting short-term upside potential. A breakout above $132–$136 could extend gains toward $145, but sustained closes above $130 are needed to confirm reversal potential. While near-term momentum is improving, the broader trend remains bearish as long as SOL trades below the 200-day SMA. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

What started as simple Bitcoin deposits on traditional sportsbooks has evolved into full no-KYC crypto sports betting platforms built around speed, privacy, and direct control over funds. Today, more players want to bet on sports with crypto without uploading documents, waiting for approvals, or dealing with banking restrictions. And that demand is shaping an entirely new category of sportsbooks. This article explores how sports betting with crypto works today, why no-KYC sportsbooks are gaining traction, and which platforms actually deliver a reliable experience — with a clear focus on modern, crypto-native solutions. Why Sports Betting Using Crypto Is Growing So Fast The appeal of crypto for sports betting is straightforward. Crypto removes intermediaries. Sports betting rewards speed. Put together, the model makes sense. Unlike traditional sportsbooks, crypto-based platforms allow users to deposit, place bets, and withdraw winnings without relying on banks or payment processors. That alone removes delays that frustrate many bettors. But speed isn’t the only reason. Sports betting using crypto is growing because it offers: Greater privacy and reduced data exposure Global access without local banking limits Faster payouts, especially for live betting Wallet-based control over balances For many users, this feels closer to how online services should work. What Does “No-KYC Sports Betting” Actually Mean? Before choosing a platform, it’s important to clarify one thing: not every crypto sportsbook is truly no-KYC. In practice, sportsbooks fall into three groups: Crypto-accepted sportsbooksThese platforms accept crypto deposits but require full verification before withdrawals. Low-KYC crypto sportsbooksBetting starts without verification, but KYC is triggered later. No-KYC crypto sportsbooksWallet-based access with no routine identity checks. For users searching for crypto sports betting no KYC, only the third category delivers consistent privacy. And this is where crypto-native platforms stand out. Dexsport — Best No-KYC Sportsbook for Betting with Crypto Dexsport is a licensed, crypto-native sportsbook and casino built for players who value speed, privacy, and transparency. Instead of adapting legacy betting models to crypto, Dexsport was designed from the ground up for Web3 users — with no KYC, wallet-first access, and on-chain visibility baked into the core experience.

This approach removes the usual black-box feeling associated with crypto casinos and sportsbooks. Results can be verified directly, without relying on vague “provably fair” claims. Transparency isn’t a promise here — it’s part of the interface. Why Dexsport Appeals to Web3 Bettors Many platforms market themselves as “Web3-friendly.” Few actually operate like one. Dexsport stands out by offering: True no-KYC access and full anonymity Broad multi-chain crypto support A combined sportsbook and casino with real depth Transparent bonuses and weekly cashback Fast sign-up via wallet, email, or Telegram No proprietary tokens. No forced ecosystems. Just direct access, clear rules, and control in the hands of the player. Advantages and Trade-Offs of Sports Betting Using Crypto No-KYC crypto betting isn’t perfect. It changes the balance between freedom and responsibility. Advantages: faster onboarding stronger privacy global access full control over funds Trade-offs: fewer formal dispute channels greater responsibility for wallet security irreversible transactions For many users, the benefits outweigh the risks — especially when betting is approached responsibly. Summing It Up Sports betting using crypto is no longer experimental. It’s an established alternative built around speed, privacy, and user control. No-KYC sportsbooks represent the clearest expression of this shift. And among them, Dexsport stands out as one of the most complete platforms for betting on sports with crypto — combining anonymity, live betting tools, and transparent settlement into a single ecosystem. As crypto adoption continues, sportsbooks designed around wallets — not paperwork — are likely to define where the market goes next.",More News,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-12-27 06:38:00

56436835,https://bitzo.com/2025/12/crypto-credit-lines-with-no-mandatory-monthly-payments-2026-review-of-top-crypto-loan-providers,1766817853,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/56436835.jpeg,Crypto Credit Lines with No Mandatory Monthly Payments: 2026 Review of Top Crypto Loan Providers,https://bitzo.com/2025/12/crypto-credit-lines-with-no-mandatory-monthly-payments-2026-review-of-top-crypto-loan-providers,"One of the biggest pain points in early crypto lending products was rigidity. Borrowers had to follow fixed repayment schedules, pay interest on funds they did not fully use, and manage monthly obligations that often made little sense in volatile markets. By 2026, this has changed. A growing number of platforms now offer crypto credit lines with no mandatory monthly payments, giving borrowers far more control over timing, cost, and risk. This review looks at how that shift is playing out across leading providers, with a focus on platforms that allow flexible repayment. Clapp leads this category, followed by Ledn, Compound, and Binance Loans—each taking a different approach to borrower freedom. Why Borrowers Prefer No Mandatory Monthly Payments Crypto-backed borrowing is often used as a liquidity buffer rather than a traditional loan. Investors may need funds temporarily, irregularly, or only during specific market conditions. Monthly repayment requirements can force unnecessary asset sales or poor timing decisions. Credit lines without mandatory payments solve this by allowing borrowers to repay when it suits their strategy. Instead of managing a schedule, borrowers manage risk and collateral health, which aligns better with how crypto markets actually behave. Clapp — Most Flexible Credit Line With Zero Carrying Cost Clapp is built entirely around the idea that liquidity should be optional, not expensive. Its revolving crypto credit line allows users to secure a borrowing limit and leave it unused at 0% APR. Interest only applies once funds are withdrawn. What sets Clapp apart in 2026 is how completely it removes repayment pressure. There are no monthly payments, no fixed terms, and no penalties for early or partial repayment. Borrowers repay whenever they choose, and once they do, the available credit automatically resets. Clapp also supports multi-collateral portfolios, allowing up to 19 assets—including BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, LINK, and stablecoins—to back a single credit line. This reduces volatility risk and makes the absence of repayment deadlines safer for both the borrower and the platform. For users who want liquidity on standby without ongoing cost or obligations, Clapp offers the most borrower-friendly structure in the market. Ledn — No Monthly Payments With a Conservative Model Ledn takes a more conservative approach to crypto-backed credit but still avoids mandatory monthly repayments. Borrowers typically repay interest periodically or at maturity, depending on the product structure, rather than following a strict monthly amortization schedule. Ledn focuses primarily on BTC-backed lending and emphasizes capital preservation and transparency. While it does not offer the same revolving, pay-as-you-use flexibility as Clapp, it appeals to borrowers who value simplicity and conservative risk management over maximum flexibility. Ledn works best for users who want fewer variables and are comfortable with a more traditional loan structure—just without monthly repayment pressure. Compound — No Payments, but Active Risk Management Required Compound represents the DeFi version of repayment flexibility. There are no mandatory payments at all—no monthly schedule, no maturity date. Borrowers can repay whenever they choose, or not at all, as long as their collateral remains above liquidation thresholds. That flexibility comes with responsibility. Because interest accrues continuously and collateral ratios fluctuate in real time, borrowers must actively monitor their positions. Sudden market movements can trigger liquidations without warning if collateral health is neglected. Compound suits experienced users who understand on-chain risk management and prefer non-custodial control. It offers freedom, but not guidance. Binance Loans — Flexible Repayment Within Defined Terms Binance Loans sit somewhere between traditional crypto loans and modern credit lines. While some products require repayment at maturity rather than monthly installments, terms are still defined upfront. Borrowers can often repay early without penalties, and there is no forced monthly payment cycle. However, interest usually applies to the full borrowed amount from day one, which makes Binance less cost-efficient for users who need liquidity only intermittently. Binance Loans are most suitable for users already active on the exchange who want convenient access to borrowing without strict monthly obligations, even if flexibility is not absolute. Crypto Credit Lines Without Mandatory Monthly Payments Platform Product Type Monthly Payments Required Interest Model Collateral Type Best For Clapp Revolving crypto credit line No Interest only on used funds; 0% APR on unused limit Multi-collateral (up to 19 assets) Borrowers seeking maximum flexibility and lowest carrying cost Ledn Crypto-backed loan No fixed monthly payments (interest or maturity-based) Interest on full loan amount Primarily BTC Conservative borrowers focused on simplicity Compound DeFi lending protocol No Variable, continuous interest On-chain collateral (WBTC, ETH, stablecoins) Advanced users comfortable with active risk management Binance Loans Exchange-based crypto loans No monthly payments (repayment at maturity) Interest on full borrowed amount Broad asset support Exchange users seeking convenient borrowing Final Thoughts In 2026, crypto credit lines without mandatory monthly payments are becoming the standard for borrowers who value flexibility. Among the platforms reviewed, Clapp offers the clearest and most cost-efficient version of this model, combining zero-cost standby liquidity, multi-collateral support, and complete repayment freedom. Ledn, Compound, and Binance Loans each serve distinct user profiles, from conservative BTC holders to DeFi-native borrowers. The right choice depends on how actively you manage risk and how often you expect to use borrowed funds. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

56437074,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/12/storytelling-in-crypto-pr-why-narratives-matter-more-than-announcements,1766817958,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/56437074.jpeg,Storytelling in Crypto PR: Why Narratives Matter More Than Announcements,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/12/storytelling-in-crypto-pr-why-narratives-matter-more-than-announcements,"Crypto teams often believe attention comes from activity. More announcements, more features, more updates. In practice, attention comes from clarity. And clarity comes from storytelling. In crypto PR, storytelling is not about slogans or dramatization. It is about explaining why a project exists, how it fits into the market, and why anyone outside the team should care. This gap between building and being understood is where most projects lose traction — and where effective PR makes a difference. Based on the experience of Outset PR working with Web3 companies, this article explains how storytelling functions in crypto PR when it actually works. Why storytelling matters in crypto PR Crypto media and communities see hundreds of launches every month. New chains, new tokens, new platforms. Most of them sound interchangeable because they are presented as isolated updates rather than parts of a larger narrative. Journalists do not cover features. They cover relevance. Communities do not rally around roadmaps. They rally around meaning. Outset PR treats every public update as part of a wider story. A feature is never the story on its own. The story is the market problem it responds to, and the timing of that response. When communication starts there, attention follows naturally. From product updates to narratives journalists understand Many crypto PR pitches fail because they confuse internal progress with external significance. A team knows why a release matters. The reader does not. Outset PR reframes product updates as reactions to real failures in the market. A governance upgrade becomes part of the broader conversation about why rushed decision-making has damaged trust in DeFi. An infrastructure release is positioned as a response to scaling mistakes made during previous market cycles. Nothing is exaggerated. The feature stays the same. What changes is the context. This is what makes a story usable for journalists and readable for non-technical audiences. Storytelling starts with positioning PR storytelling begins with positioning. Positioning defines the logic behind a project’s existence. Outset PR works with teams to articulate why the product was built, what the founders identified early, and which strategic choices shaped development. These elements form a narrative foundation that guides all communication. Once this foundation is established, it informs decisions about media outreach, founder commentary, and community messaging. Each public message reinforces the same underlying story and contributes to a coherent long-term narrative. One narrative across media and community communication Crypto PR reaches different audiences through different channels. Journalists and communities engage with information in distinct ways, but both respond to consistency. Outset PR maintains a single narrative while adjusting emphasis. Media communication highlights relevance to market trends and industry discussions. Community communication focuses on progress, direction, and participation. The narrative remains stable across both contexts. This structure preserves clarity and prevents fragmentation of the project’s identity. Timing and narrative alignment in crypto PR Storytelling gains strength when it aligns with active market conversations. Crypto narratives evolve in cycles driven by technology shifts, regulation, and user behavior. Outset PR monitors these cycles to identify moments of natural alignment between a project’s development and broader industry focus. Communication launched during these windows integrates smoothly into existing discussions and gains higher visibility. This approach supports relevance without altering the project’s core message. What storytelling achieves in crypto PR Storytelling creates continuity, recognition, and understanding. Journalists gain clear reference points for coverage. Communities gain a sense of direction and involvement. Investors gain insight into strategic thinking and long-term planning. Projects that communicate through narrative build durable presence in the market. Storytelling gives crypto PR the structure needed to sustain attention over time.

And, it did at least for the first week or so. Bitcoin skyrocketed to a new all-time high of over $126,000. However, it all went horribly wrong in the following few days, especially after the October 10 crash, when over $19 billion worth of liquidations hit overleveraged traders. Nothing was really the same after that calamity, which is still being cited as the beginning of the end. The cryptocurrency has plunged by over 30% since then and now struggles below $90,000, which has become an insurmountable resistance. Analysts are predominantly aligned in believing that the bear market has actually started, and the question now is when the BTC bottom will be. 364 Days From the Top? Obviously, every analyst has a different theory on this, including Doctor Profit, who said that BTC will drop to somewhere around $40,000 by Q3 2026. In this article, though, we will focus on Ali Martinez’s opinion, which, to be fair, is not all that different. He based his analysis on the cycle top and bottom theory. As previously reported, bitcoin has the tendency to reach a cycle top precisely 1,064 days after its previous bottom, which was the case between the January 2015 and December 2017 bull market, as well as between December 2018 and November 2021 rally. Interestingly, the early October 2025 ATH was also after 1,064 days . Consequently, Martinez assumed that the bear market had started on that history-making date and had set up the stage for the subsequent long-term correction. He noted that these periods last 364 days (or almost an entire year) and the potential bottom should be around October 2026. How Low Will BTC Go? Continuing with the same history lesson, Martinez asserted that BTC had plunged by 84% during the 2017-2018 bear market and by 77% during the 2021-2022 one. If we average that number to around 80%, the next market bottom should see the cryptocurrency dropping to around $37,500. While this sounds indeed scary at the moment, it’s worth noting that this projection is based on the popular 4-year cycle theory. However, many other analysts have claimed in the past several months that BTC has snapped out of it and it operates under different rules, given its institutional rise, ETF products, DATs, and government backing.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain dominant forms of collateral, many investors now hold significant positions in assets like SOL, BNB, LINK, and other high-liquidity altcoins. The challenge for lenders is clear: altcoins introduce higher volatility, and without careful risk controls, credit lines backed by them can become fragile. Clapp approaches this problem with a structured risk framework built around multi-collateral design, conservative credit mechanics, and regulatory oversight. Its altcoin-backed crypto credit line is designed to balance flexibility for borrowers with stability for the platform. Why Altcoin-Backed Credit Lines Are Riskier by Default Altcoins tend to be more volatile than BTC or ETH. Their prices can move sharply on lower liquidity, protocol news, or market sentiment. In a single-collateral lending model, this volatility directly increases liquidation risk. A sudden drawdown in one asset can quickly push a loan below safe collateral thresholds. For borrowers, this often means frequent margin calls or forced liquidations. For platforms, it creates systemic risk if many loans rely on correlated assets during market stress. This is where Clapp’s approach diverges from simpler altcoin-lending models. Multi-Collateral as the First Layer of Risk Control Clapp does not treat altcoins as isolated collateral positions. Instead, they are part of a multi-collateral pool that can include up to 19 different assets, ranging from BTC and ETH to SOL, BNB, LINK, and stablecoins. Rather than relying on a single volatile asset, Clapp evaluates the combined value and composition of the entire collateral portfolio. This reduces exposure to sharp moves in any one token and smooths overall risk. If an altcoin experiences a temporary drop, stronger or more stable assets in the pool help absorb the impact. This portfolio-based approach reflects how professional risk management works in traditional finance, where exposure is assessed at the portfolio level rather than asset by asset. Dynamic Collateral Management and Real-Time Adjustments Risk management at Clapp is dynamic, meaning borrowers can actively manage and rebalance their positions as markets move. If volatility increases in a specific altcoin, users can: Add more stable collateral Reduce exposure to the volatile asset Shift weight toward BTC, ETH, or stablecoins The credit line updates in real time based on the revised collateral mix. This flexibility allows borrowers to respond to market conditions before risk escalates to liquidation thresholds. Importantly, this dynamic structure works alongside Clapp’s credit-line model, where borrowers are not locked into fixed loan amounts or repayment schedules. Credit Line Structure as a Risk-Reduction Tool Clapp’s revolving crypto credit line also plays a role in controlling risk. Borrowers are not forced to draw the full amount of available credit. In fact, unused credit carries 0% APR, encouraging conservative usage. Interest accrues only on the portion of funds actually withdrawn, at a 2.9% annual rate. This reduces incentives to overborrow, which is a common source of liquidation risk in fixed-loan models. Because there is no repayment schedule, borrowers are also less likely to delay risk-reducing actions due to timing constraints. They can repay partially or fully at any moment to restore healthier collateral ratios. Regulatory Oversight and the European License Beyond technical risk controls, Clapp operates under a regulatory framework that adds an additional layer of discipline. Clapp holds a VASP license in the Czech Republic, aligning its operations with European regulatory standards for crypto service providers. This status requires compliance with AML and operational transparency obligations, as well as clear internal controls around asset handling. While regulation does not eliminate market risk, it does reduce counterparty and operational risk. Final Thoughts Altcoin-backed crypto credit lines require more than simple collateral ratios to be safe. They demand portfolio-level thinking, flexible management, and disciplined borrowing structures. Clapp’s approach reflects this reality. By combining multi-collateral design, dynamic rebalancing, pay-as-you-use credit lines, and operation under a Czech VASP license, Clapp demonstrates how altcoin risk can be managed without sacrificing borrower flexibility. For crypto holders looking to unlock liquidity from diversified portfolios, this risk-aware structure marks a meaningful evolution in crypto lending.

This comprehensive analysis examines MKR price predictions from 2026 through 2030, evaluating the protocol’s fundamental strengths within the expanding DeFi ecosystem. MakerDAO’s unique position as the pioneer of decentralized stablecoins provides crucial context for understanding MKR’s investment trajectory. MakerDAO Price Prediction: Analyzing MKR’s Market Position MakerDAO maintains its foundational role in decentralized finance through the Dai stablecoin ecosystem. The protocol’s governance token, MKR, serves multiple critical functions including system governance, risk management, and collateral backing. According to blockchain analytics firm Messari, MakerDAO consistently ranks among the top three DeFi protocols by total value locked, demonstrating sustained institutional and retail confidence. Furthermore, the protocol’s multi-collateral Dai system now supports over 30 different asset types, significantly expanding its utility and stability mechanisms. Recent developments in 2024 and early 2025 have substantially impacted MKR’s valuation framework. The successful implementation of Endgame Phase 1 introduced SubDAOs and enhanced governance efficiency. These technical upgrades, combined with growing real-world asset adoption, create new revenue streams for the protocol. Consequently, analysts from CoinMetrics and CryptoCompare note improved fundamentals that could influence MKR’s price trajectory through the latter half of the decade. Technical and Fundamental Analysis for 2026-2027 Projections Technical analysis reveals several key patterns for MKR’s medium-term outlook. Historical data from TradingView indicates that MKR has established stronger support levels following each major market cycle. The token’s correlation with broader cryptocurrency markets has decreased from 0.85 in 2021 to approximately 0.65 in 2025, suggesting growing independence from Bitcoin’s price movements. This decoupling trend, documented in a 2024 Journal of Digital Finance study, typically precedes more stable long-term growth patterns for established DeFi assets. Expert Perspectives on MKR’s Valuation Drivers Industry experts emphasize several critical factors for MKR’s valuation through 2027. Dr. Elena Rodriguez, blockchain economist at Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, identifies three primary drivers: “First, Dai’s adoption in traditional finance partnerships; second, governance participation rates among token holders; third, the protocol’s ability to maintain stability during market stress events.” These elements directly impact MKR’s burn mechanism and governance utility, creating fundamental value beyond speculative trading. The following table summarizes key metrics analysts monitor for MKR valuation: Metric Current Status (2025) Projected Trend Dai Supply 5.2 billion Increasing Governance Participation 42% of circulating supply Moderate growth Protocol Revenue $48M quarterly Accelerating RWA Collateral Percentage 38% Significant increase Long-Term Outlook: MKR Price Prediction 2028-2030 The 2028-2030 period presents both opportunities and challenges for MakerDAO’s native token. Regulatory developments will significantly influence DeFi adoption rates globally. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework implementation, scheduled for full enforcement by 2026, creates clearer compliance pathways for decentralized stablecoins. Consequently, Dai could experience accelerated adoption in regulated financial environments, potentially increasing demand for MKR tokens through enhanced governance requirements. Technological advancements also factor heavily into long-term projections. The anticipated completion of MakerDAO’s Endgame roadmap by 2027 should create a more modular and efficient protocol architecture. According to technical documentation reviewed by blockchain research firm Delphi Digital, these upgrades aim to improve scalability, reduce governance friction, and enhance ecosystem sustainability. Such improvements typically correlate with increased protocol usage and, by extension, greater utility for governance tokens like MKR. Comparative Analysis with Competing DeFi Protocols MakerDAO operates within a competitive landscape featuring protocols like Aave, Compound, and emerging decentralized stablecoin projects. Unlike purely lending-focused protocols, MakerDAO’s primary product—the Dai stablecoin—occupies a distinct market niche. Data from DeFi Llama indicates that decentralized stablecoins collectively represent approximately 8% of the total stablecoin market, with significant growth potential as trust in centralized alternatives fluctuates. This market expansion could disproportionately benefit early innovators like MakerDAO, provided they maintain technological and governance advantages. Several key differentiators position MKR uniquely: First-mover advantage in decentralized stablecoins Proven stability through multiple market cycles Growing real-world asset integration enhancing collateral diversity Established governance community with high participation rates Regulatory engagement through transparent operations Risk Factors and Market Considerations for MKR Investors Potential investors must carefully evaluate several risk factors alongside MKR’s promising fundamentals. Regulatory uncertainty remains a primary concern, particularly regarding how different jurisdictions will classify and govern DeFi governance tokens. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s ongoing classification debates could significantly impact MKR’s trading accessibility on major exchanges. Additionally, technological risks persist, including smart contract vulnerabilities and potential protocol upgrades that might not achieve intended outcomes. Market competition represents another crucial consideration. New decentralized stablecoin projects with innovative mechanisms continue entering the space, potentially challenging Dai’s market share. However, MakerDAO’s extensive track record and substantial ecosystem provide significant defensive advantages. The protocol’s decentralized nature and community-driven development have historically enabled adaptive responses to competitive pressures, as documented in a 2023 MIT Digital Currency Initiative case study. Conclusion MakerDAO’s MKR token presents a compelling case study in DeFi investment analysis through 2030. The protocol’s foundational role in decentralized finance, combined with ongoing technological development and expanding real-world integration, creates multiple pathways for value appreciation. While market volatility and regulatory developments will inevitably influence short-term price movements, MKR’s utility as a governance token within one of DeFi’s most established ecosystems provides fundamental support. Investors conducting thorough due diligence should consider both the protocol’s innovative potential and its proven resilience when evaluating MKR as a long-term DeFi investment. FAQs Q1: What primarily drives MKR’s value as a cryptocurrency? MKR’s value derives from its utility within the MakerDAO ecosystem, including governance rights, protocol fee mechanisms, and its role in maintaining the Dai stablecoin’s collateralization. The token’s price generally correlates with protocol usage, revenue generation, and overall DeFi adoption trends. Q2: How does MakerDAO generate revenue, and how does this benefit MKR holders? MakerDAO generates revenue primarily through stability fees charged on Dai loans and liquidations of undercollateralized positions. A portion of this revenue funds the protocol’s surplus buffer, while excess revenue triggers MKR token burns, potentially reducing supply and increasing scarcity over time. Q3: What are the biggest risks to MKR’s price growth through 2030? Significant risks include regulatory crackdowns on DeFi governance tokens, technological failures within the Maker protocol, increased competition from alternative stablecoin projects, and broader cryptocurrency market downturns that reduce overall DeFi activity and collateral values. Q4: How does MKR differ from other DeFi governance tokens like COMP or AAVE? Unlike lending protocol tokens, MKR specifically governs a decentralized stablecoin system with unique stability mechanisms. MKR holders manage critical risk parameters for collateral assets and the Dai monetary policy, creating different utility dynamics compared to tokens governing primarily lending markets. Q5: What metrics should investors monitor when evaluating MKR’s long-term potential? Key metrics include Dai supply growth, percentage of real-world asset collateral, governance participation rates, protocol revenue and surplus buffer levels, MKR token burn rates, and the overall health of the MakerDAO ecosystem as measured by developer activity and community engagement.

Yet the most important difference between lending platforms lies deeper—in how collateral is managed over time. Some platforms rely on static collateral models, while others like Clapp.finance operate with dynamic collateral in crypto loans . The distinction determines how risk is monitored, how quickly problems surface, and how much control borrowers retain when markets move. What Static Collateral Means In a static collateral model, collateral is assessed primarily at loan origination. The borrower deposits assets, receives a loan, and the position remains largely unchanged unless liquidation thresholds are reached. Risk monitoring exists, but it is reactive. Alerts tend to arrive late, and adjustments often require closing or refinancing the loan. Interest accrues on the full loan amount, and repayment structures are fixed or semi-fixed. Static models resemble traditional lending. They offer simplicity, but they assume relatively stable conditions. In crypto markets, that assumption rarely holds. The Limits of Static Collateral in Volatile Markets When prices move slowly, static collateral works. When volatility spikes, it becomes fragile. Because static models rely on predefined terms, borrowers often discover risk only when LTV is already high. By the time margin calls or liquidation warnings appear, the window to act may be narrow. Static collateral also discourages incremental adjustments. Adding collateral or reducing exposure mid-loan can be operationally cumbersome, increasing the chance of forced liquidation. What Dynamic Collateral Management Looks Like Dynamic collateral models treat risk as a continuous variable rather than a binary state. Collateral values, LTV, and borrowing capacity are recalculated in real time as market prices change. Borrowers can adjust exposure incrementally by adding collateral or repaying part of the balance without restructuring the loan. Interest typically accrues only on active borrowing, not on theoretical exposure. This aligns cost with real usage and encourages more conservative behavior. Dynamic models are better suited to markets where prices shift rapidly and unpredictably. How Clapp Applies Dynamic Collateral Control Clapp is a licensed European crypto loan provider that operates a credit-line model built on dynamic collateral management. Users deposit crypto and receive a borrowing limit rather than a fixed loan. LTV is calculated continuously based on the drawn balance and real-time collateral value. Unused credit does not increase risk and carries 0% APR. Rates adjust with LTV, reflecting current risk rather than assumptions made at origination. Borrowers receive early notifications as their position approaches liquidation thresholds, giving them time to act. Because repayments immediately restore available credit, exposure can be fine-tuned instead of reset. This makes risk management an ongoing process rather than a one-time decision. Dynamic vs Static: The Risk Control Difference The core difference between static and dynamic collateral is timing. Static models respond when risk is already high. Dynamic models surface risk as it develops. This difference often determines whether borrowers exit positions on their own terms or through forced liquidation. Dynamic collateral management does not remove risk, but it makes risk visible and manageable. It shifts control back to the borrower. Choosing the Right Model Static collateral may suit users who prefer fixed terms and minimal interaction, but it requires acceptance of higher liquidation risk during sudden market moves. Dynamic collateral models favor active oversight, transparency, and flexibility. They are better aligned with how crypto markets behave in practice. For borrowers using crypto loans as a liquidity tool rather than a leverage play, dynamic collateral offers a more resilient framework. Final Thoughts Risk control in crypto lending is not defined by interest rates or marketing claims. It is defined by how collateral is monitored and adjusted as markets change. The shift from static to dynamic collateral models reflects the maturation of crypto lending. Platforms that embrace continuous risk management give borrowers a clearer view of their exposure and more tools to stay in control when volatility returns.

Rather than relying on opinion, the post centers on excerpts from an official-looking publication that, according to SMQKE, records how Russian financial authorities evaluated blockchain solutions for cross-border settlements, with explicit references to Ripple and XRP. The material shared shifts the focus from market narratives to institutional research, inviting readers to examine what appears to be a formal assessment carried out by Russia’s central banking system. Research Into Cross-Border Settlement Systems SMQKE reports that the attached document outlines work conducted by the Bank of Russia, including activities in the first half of 2018 through its Novosibirsk innovative laboratory. The research reportedly investigated whether blockchain technology could enhance cross-border transfer mechanisms and whether the Ripple platform could serve as a viable foundation for such systems. According to the text highlighted in the images, the study examined how settlement participants could operate special accounts within national payment systems while also maintaining addresses on the Ripple network. The goal, as described, was to test whether transactions could be reflected efficiently in domestic systems after each transfer or at designated intervals, creating a bridge between traditional infrastructure and distributed ledger technology. Central Bank of Russia XRP Documented. https://t.co/dZ0agfKOV2 pic.twitter.com/wBQh6ZosNq — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) December 23, 2025 Conditions for Using XRP in Settlements SMQKE emphasizes that the document does not merely mention experimentation but goes further to outline conclusions and prerequisites. The research reportedly determined that the Ripple platform could be considered as a foundation for building a cross-border settlement system, provided certain organizational, legal, and technical matters were resolved. Within that framework, the document references the potential use of XRP for transfers or fiat equivalents issued by participating national banks. It also discusses mechanisms for reconciling balances between Ripple network accounts and domestic payment systems, the application of embedded cryptographic solutions, and the development of procedures for determining exchange rates when XRP is used in interstate settlements. In SMQKE’s reading, these details suggest that XRP was evaluated not as an abstract concept but as a practical instrument within a structured financial model. What the Documents Suggest About Institutional Interest The post frames these findings as evidence that central banking institutions have, at least at a research level, taken XRP seriously as part of future payment architecture. SMQKE presents the material as confirmation that discussions around blockchain adoption were already occurring within major monetary authorities years ago, well before current debates about digital assets and financial modernization intensified.

Community Reaction and Broader Implications Alongside SMQKE’s presentation, an X user identified as Tyler reacted by characterizing the connection between Russia and XRP as unexpected and strategic, suggesting that it underscores how global financial alignments continue to evolve and why tracking flows and diversification remains important. Overall, SMQKE’s post positions the shared document as a reminder that behind today’s headlines are years of formal studies and internal evaluations. If accurately represented, the material suggests that XRP has been a long-standing topic of discussion within influential financial bodies, thereby reinforcing its relevance in conversations about the future of cross-border payments.

Starting from January 1, Hoskinson’s fan base will be able to engage with him on Midnight Discord for weekly AMAs, YouTube for livestreams, and he also said he will focus on long-form writing that has been a decade in the making. The person behind Cardano and, in parts, Ethereum believes X “rewards outrage,” while the work that they are building, including Africa, Midnight 1.0, and Cardano governance, “rewards building.” The comments below his post were split. Some were quick to praise his move, agreeing that this is a decision many are “contemplating, given the direction of the platform.” Others were a bit more dismissive, saying that Hoskinson didn’t have to announce his departure as X is not an airport. ADA Price Impact? Hoskinson’s most important engagements on X have sometimes impacted the price of ADA, including on multiple occasions last year when he said he would work with the Trump administration in 2026 to establish clear crypto regulations. Or, when he hinted that Cardano might partner with Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Both of these led to immediate double-digit price pumps. The situation now seems rather different, though. He has taken sabbaticals from X in the past, which didn’t really affect ADA. Even if he doesn’t return this time, he would still be available on other platforms. Nevertheless, ADA has been dropping hard in the past several months. It’s down by over 5% weekly and 18% monthly, and sits well below the cycle peak of over $1, currently trading at $0.35.

This action, first reported by The Information, immediately sent ripples through the fintech and cryptocurrency sectors, highlighting the persistent regulatory hurdles facing blockchain-based payment firms. Significantly, the bank clarified its position was rooted in specific sanctions compliance, not opposition to stablecoin technology itself, framing the incident as a critical case study in global financial governance. JPMorgan Freezes Accounts: The Core Sanctions Allegation JPMorgan took the definitive step of severing banking services to BlindPay and Kontigo after identifying business activities linked to regions under U.S. sanctions, primarily Venezuela. Both startups, operating within Latin America’s burgeoning digital economy, accessed the bank’s crucial infrastructure through Checkbook, a digital payments firm. Consequently, this channel did not shield them from the stringent compliance reviews major banks must perform. The bank’s statement was unequivocal: the decision resulted from the firms’ connections to sanctioned jurisdictions, not from a philosophical stance against stablecoins. This distinction is vital for understanding the modern financial landscape, where compliance often dictates access. Furthermore, this event is not isolated. Major financial institutions globally operate under intense scrutiny from regulators like the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). They must meticulously monitor transactions to avoid severe penalties. For instance, in recent years, other banks have faced billion-dollar fines for sanctions violations. Therefore, JPMorgan’s proactive account freeze represents a standard, if impactful, risk mitigation procedure. The action protects the bank from potential legal and reputational damage, demonstrating the non-negotiable nature of sanctions enforcement in international banking. Navigating the Latin American Stablecoin Ecosystem The targeted startups, BlindPay and Kontigo, operate in a region where stablecoins have gained substantial traction. Latin American economies frequently grapple with high inflation and currency volatility. Stablecoins, digital assets pegged to stable reserves like the US dollar, offer residents a potential hedge and a more efficient medium for remittances and cross-border trade. Many analysts view them as a financial innovation tool for the region. However, their integration with the traditional banking system, often called the “on-ramp” and “off-ramp,” remains fraught with challenges. Access to banking partners like JPMorgan is essential for these startups. It allows users to convert local currency into stablecoins and vice versa. Without it, their operational capacity severely diminishes. This dependency creates a vulnerability, as seen in this case. The situation reveals a broader tension: innovative fintech firms pushing financial inclusion versus established banks bound by rigid, global compliance frameworks. This tension defines much of the current dialogue between the crypto industry and traditional finance. The Critical Role of Banking Correspondents and Third-Party Services BlindPay and Kontigo utilized Checkbook as their gateway to JPMorgan’s services. This is a common model where fintechs partner with licensed payment processors or specialized banks that can provide direct access to larger financial networks. This layered structure, however, does not absolve the end-client from compliance scrutiny. Banks like JPMorgan maintain ultimate responsibility for their clients’ activities, even those introduced by third parties. The due diligence process, known as Know Your Customer’s Customer (KYCC), is becoming increasingly stringent. This incident will likely prompt payment facilitators like Checkbook to enhance their own vetting processes for crypto-related clients. The Ripple Effect: Impacts on Startups and Market Sentiment The immediate impact on BlindPay and Kontigo is operational paralysis. A frozen bank account halts customer deposits and withdrawals, effectively freezing business activity. This can quickly erode user trust and trigger liquidity crises. For the wider Latin American crypto market, the event serves as a stark warning. It may cause other banks to reassess their exposure to crypto-native businesses, potentially leading to broader “de-risking” in the region. This could stifle innovation and limit consumer access to digital dollar alternatives. Conversely, the bank’s explicit statement distancing the action from anti-stablecoin sentiment could be seen as a nuanced positive. It acknowledges stablecoins as a legitimate, if regulated, financial product. The table below contrasts potential short-term and long-term impacts of this decision: Area of Impact Short-Term Consequence Potential Long-Term Effect Targeted Startups Operational shutdown, loss of user trust. Forced restructuring, seeking non-US banking partners, or closure. Latin American Crypto Sector Increased caution from investors and partners. Stronger focus on compliance infrastructure and local banking alliances. Global Bank Policy Reinforced strict sanctions screening for fintech clients. Clearer, but potentially more restrictive, onboarding frameworks for crypto firms. Market analysts note that such events accelerate the industry’s maturation. Startups are now compelled to build robust compliance programs from inception. They must demonstrate clear geofencing capabilities, transaction monitoring, and adherence to sanctions lists. This professionalization, while costly, may ultimately lead to more sustainable businesses and greater institutional acceptance. Conclusion The decision by JPMorgan to freeze the accounts of stablecoin startups BlindPay and Kontigo is a multifaceted event with clear origins in sanctions enforcement. It underscores an immutable reality for the cryptocurrency sector: innovation must coexist with rigorous compliance. For Latin America, a region where digital assets promise significant economic utility, the incident highlights the fragile bridge between new financial technologies and the established global banking system. The path forward requires crypto firms to prioritize transparency and regulatory dialogue, while banks may need to develop more nuanced risk frameworks. Ultimately, this case of JPMorgan freezing accounts is less about opposition to stablecoins and more about the unforgiving mechanics of international finance law in a digital age. FAQs Q1: Why did JPMorgan freeze the accounts of BlindPay and Kontigo? JPMorgan froze the accounts because the startups were involved in business activities connected to U.S.-sanctioned regions, primarily Venezuela. The bank stated the action was strictly for sanctions compliance, not due to opposition to stablecoins. Q2: What are stablecoins, and why are they popular in Latin America? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable asset like the US dollar. They are popular in Latin America as a hedge against local currency inflation and for cheaper, faster cross-border payments and remittances. Q3: How did these startups have accounts with JPMorgan? They accessed JPMorgan’s banking services indirectly through a third-party digital payments firm called Checkbook, which acted as an intermediary or facilitator. Q4: Does this mean banks are against all cryptocurrency companies? Not necessarily. JPMorgan’s statement clarified the action was sanctions-based. Many banks work with crypto firms that demonstrate strong compliance programs, but they remain highly cautious due to regulatory and reputational risks. Q5: What can other crypto startups learn from this incident? Startups must invest in robust legal and compliance teams, ensure their business models and customer bases avoid sanctioned jurisdictions, and be transparent with banking partners about their operations and risk controls.

The prevailing market trends are also responsible for fueling heated discussions in the circles of each type of cryptocurrency. Even in the case of Shiba Inu (SHIB), which can be termed as a popular memecoin in the market today, there’s a sense of indecision. Price performance happens to be a concern in this case, along with the fact that there are no major discussions on socials. Even then, there are individuals with market knowledge who are moving towards projects that have a greater level of stability in relation to a memecoin. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) finds itself in the midst of a new wave in view of greater stability. Shiba Inu Faces Market Challenges For the Shiba Inu cryptocurrency, one can assess that the present position of the cryptocurrency is in a difficult position. The market performance of the cryptocurrency is still in the negative zone. On analyzing the performance of the cryptocurrency, one can assess that a fall can be perceived at a rate of $0.0000066 rather than a rise. There are certain important factors that support the negative observation mentioned above. The engagement of the general public with regard to the SHIB cryptocurrency appears to be decreasing in the internet world, which reveals a lack of interest in the cryptocurrency. The entire market of the cryptocurrency is facing a downfall; such situations are being witnessed. Mutuum Finance: A Far Better Crypto Option Whereas others like SHIB are facing difficulties, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents an attractive and well-considered option. This is more than a new crypto option; it has already had its security audit and is almost ready to be launched. Those investors searching for the next big crypto are generally supportive of MUTM as it is actually making considerable progress and offers an attractive presale option. It has already raised in excess of $19.5 million from 18,580+ investors in its presale offering. It is currently in Phase 6, where each unit sells at $0.035. This represents an increase of 250% from its initial purchase price. Phase 6 is already 99% sold out. This is the final level where tokens will be priced at $0.035. Then comes the cost of $0.040 in phase 7 of the project. Further, the final launch cost is set for $0.06; hence, there is profit potential in the cost of launch. An added feature that makes an investment in the ecosystem attractive is the incorporation of two methods of lending. One of the methods utilizes communal pool of assets like ETH. The other method allows the custom compilation of contracts. It also has the most essential stablecoin in the pipeline. The stablecoin has been developed in such a way as to maintain the price of the coin stable at $1. An added feature that is attractive in the sense that it acts as a way of enticement of the investment in the project is the incorporation of a daily leaderboard. It rewards the top-buying individual of the day with a bonus of $500 in MUTM. However, the particular individual ought to have made some activity of trade on that particular day. The security of all the codes has also been reviewed by the most expert auditors of the business. A Moment for Strategic Action The market conditions give rise to the existence of a unique divergence. There exist crypto communities that remain undecided about their strategy such as SHIB. On the other hand, the well-defined use cases of others have been pulling in sensible investments. Mutuum Finance is one of the pioneers in this regard. It is providing the true product along with the evidence of its security and a fast presale. For individuals interested in the sound and best crypto to invest in, there exists the unique choice in the form of MUTM. The opportunity for investing in the prevailing price of MUTM is dwindling down quickly.

Key Takeaways: Bitmain is slashing prices across older and newer ASIC models to clear inventory amid weak mining economics. Discounted deals have pushed some S19 and S21 machines to as low as $3–$4 per terahash, with deliveries scheduled into 2026. The company is pairing hardware sales with hosting services to stimulate demand and move equipment. The discounts span both older models and newer-generation machines, signaling a broad effort to clear inventory as mining economics remain strained, according to a report by TheMinerMag . In late December, the world’s largest ASIC manufacturer began advertising bundled deals and factory discounts that would have stood out as distressed sales earlier in the cycle. Bitmain Offers S19 XP+ Hydro Miners at $4/TH in Discounted Bundle Deal One promotion dated Dec. 23 offered a package of four S19 XP+ Hydro units paired with an ANTRACK V2 container, implying an effective price of roughly $4 per terahash for the 19 J/TH machines. Shipments for that batch are scheduled to begin in January 2026, suggesting Bitmain is willing to lock in low pricing well ahead of delivery. The move followed a separate auction-style sale in November for the air-cooled S19k Pro, a 23 J/TH model. That sale opened with a starting bid of $5.5 per terahash and allowed buyers to submit their own pricing. Final transaction values were determined after the bidding period closed, with deliveries slated for December 2025. Discounting appears to extend well beyond limited promotions. Internal factory price lists shared with customers and reviewed by TheMinerMag show that as of Dec. 22, Bitmain was quoting prices as low as $3 per terahash for S19e XP Hydro and 3U S19 XP Hydro units, while S19 XP+ Hydro machines were listed around $4 per terahash. Bitcoin network hashrate every Christmas Eve: 2009: 9 MH/s 2010: 108 GH/s 2011: 8 TH/s 2012: 22 TH/s 2013: 9 PH/s 2014: 271 PH/s 2015: 709 PH/s 2016: 2.3 EH/s 2017: 14 EH/s 2018: 39 EH/s 2019: 99 EH/s 2020: 134 EH/s 2021: 177 EH/s 2022: 240 EH/s 2023: 521 EH/s 2024: 779 EH/s… pic.twitter.com/50R2cogtGZ — Javier Hermosa (@JavierHermosa21) December 24, 2025 Even newer hardware has not been spared. S21 Immersion miners were offered at approximately $7 per terahash, while S21+ Hydro machines were priced near $8 per terahash before the application of coupons. The pricing update emphasized availability heading into year-end, pointing to a coordinated effort to stimulate demand. Alongside hardware discounts, Bitmain has been pushing hosting services as part of a bundled sales strategy. Hosting rates shared with customers indicate power costs generally ranging from 5.5 to 7 cents per kilowatt-hour across jurisdictions including the United States, Kazakhstan, Brazil, Paraguay and Ethiopia, plus an additional management fee. The approach suggests Bitmain is leaning more heavily on integrated sales to move equipment. Record Hashrate, Low Hashprice Squeeze Bitcoin Miners The price cuts come as Bitcoin’s network hashrate hovers near record highs while the asset’s price has pulled back, keeping hashprice close to multi-year lows. That combination has squeezed margins for miners and dampened appetite for new machines, particularly less efficient models, while intensifying competition among manufacturers and secondary-market sellers. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s network hashrate fell 4% in the month through Dec. 15, a development that could set the stage for stronger price performance in the months ahead, according to analysts at VanEck. “When hash rate compression persists over longer periods, positive forward returns tend to occur more often and with greater magnitude,” the analysts wrote.

In a recent post accompanied by a video, the analyst invites readers to reconsider the intent behind XRP’s long-standing escrow structure , arguing that its design may reveal an institutional strategy rather than a retail-focused one. This #XRP Theory Explains Everything!! pic.twitter.com/PdrR4m9JXd — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) December 23, 2025 Escrow as Pre-Allocated Institutional Liquidity The core of Ripple Bull Winkle’s argument is that the tens of billions of XRP locked in escrow were never meant to be gradually released for open market sales to everyday investors. Instead, he suggests that this reserve could represent pre-allocated liquidity intended for banks and large financial institutions. In his view, this interpretation is supported by past public comments from Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, who has indicated that escrowed XRP could, in principle, be directed to institutions if needed. By viewing the escrow as a strategic pool of liquidity, the analyst implies that XRP’s distribution model is less about organic retail circulation and more about readiness for large-scale financial deployment. This would mean that the asset’s supply has been structured with institutional demand in mind from the beginning, positioning it for use in scenarios where immediate and deep liquidity is required. Not a Rival to Bitcoin, but a Different Tool Ripple Bull Winkle further emphasizes that XRP should not be viewed as a competitor to Bitcoin. According to his analysis, Bitcoin has increasingly taken on the role of a store of value within the digital asset space, while XRP is being shaped for a different function altogether. He presents XRP as a candidate for settlement utility, aimed at addressing inefficiencies in the existing financial system rather than serving as a long-term value reserve. In this framework, XRP’s relevance would emerge most clearly during periods of systemic stress. The analyst argues that when traditional markets face disruptions, such as liquidity freezes or failures in established settlement mechanisms, institutions will require infrastructure that is already operational. Assets designed for utility, he suggests, tend to become critical at the moment of crisis rather than during speculative upswings. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Positioning Before the Shift Another element of the theory is timing. Ripple Bull Winkle contends that by the time the general public recognizes such a shift toward utility-driven adoption , the strategic positioning by institutions may already be complete. This view reinforces the idea that XRP’s design is forward-looking, anticipating a future environment where functional settlement assets are prioritized. Overall, the message from Ripple Bull Winkle centers on utility, structure, and long-term design. By portraying XRP’s escrow as a strategic reserve for institutional liquidity and aligning its role with settlement rather than speculation, the analyst presents a narrative in which XRP’s true function may only become evident when the financial system itself is put to the test.

Synthetix Coin price analysis shows an upward trend regarding current market events. The coin’s price has increased to $0.441 in the last 24 hours. If the bullish momentum continues, the SNX price might retest resistance at the $0.463 level. Conversely, if selling pressure overwhelms, the altcoin may again plunge to the $0.321 level again. Is SNX a good investment? The Synthetix rebranding in 2018 rejuvenated the ecosystem, which has grown continually with multiple listed synths. Despite concerns over the stability of its stablecoins, SNX, the native token, is set to mark new records, as seen in Cryptopolitan’s SNX price predictions from 2025 to 2031. It is expected that SNX will reach $7.57 by 2030. Why is SNX up? The cryptocurrency market is in a bullish mode, and SNX is following suit. From a larger perspective, the token is getting positive sentiment as the SNX price increased to $0.441, gaining 1.43% of its total value in the last few hours. What is the target price for SNX? The target price for SNX is $2.00 for the current year, which is still quite higher than the current Synthetix price. Will SNX reach $5? The current price action does justify predicting a $5 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that SNX will reach $5 by 2028. However, this is not investment advice, and anyone willing to purchase SNX tokens should seek independent professional consultation. Will SNX reach $6? Considering the future price movements, SNX will reach the $6 level by 2029. The last time SNX was seen at the $6 level was April 2022. Will SNX reach $10? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, SNX may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like a far target. Will SNX reach $100? No, market analysts don’t expect SNX to reach $100 during the next 10 years, considering the long term Synthetix price forecast. How high can SNX go? The highest expected price for SNX is $8.68, which it will achieve in 2031. Does SNX have a future? SNX is trading significantly lower than its mid-December price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current low price and a favorable future valuation of $8.68 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment. However, one’s own research is advised.

This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Unlike most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3, as per historical SNX market data. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token’s price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound.

Ellison has urged all residents of Minnesota to attempt and complete the survey, which he says will only take a short minute of their time. The survey seeks knowledge about the habits of users concerning crypto ATMs , including the kind of machines they like to use, the company’s machines they’ve used frequently, who introduced them to using a crypto ATM, and if they have lost funds as a result of transacting on the machines. The survey was also emailed directly to users who have used crypto ATMs operated by one of the nation’s leading providers. Minnesota residents urged to complete assessment In a news release, Ellison mentioned that the survey became necessary because scammers and fraudsters are constantly developing new tools and tactics to steal money from hardworking residents of Minnesota. He added that it is essential for him and the law enforcement in the state to keep pace with the criminals. Ellison also added that crypto ATMs have become the go-to method for scammers, as they use them to extort money from their victims. In addition, Ellison mentioned that the increased rate at which these criminals have been targeting Minnesotans has been deeply concerning. He also encouraged all residents of Minnesota who have used a crypto ATM to complete the survey. Ellison added that the results of the survey will provide him with what he needs to be able to fight scammers and protect the funds of hardworking Minnesotans. The AG noted that if residents are genuinely interested in purchasing crypto, they should follow better methods. The release of this survey comes after a scam alert issued by Ellison on December 19, where he warned consumers about the risks of using crypto ATMs. In the statement, the Minnesota AG warned that the criminals have been deploying new techniques and methods, noting that the rate of success in new cases has been climbing. The crypto ATM scam warning and this survey are all part of the larger investigation Ellison’s Consumer Protection Division has been carrying out on crypto ATMs. Crypto ATM scams on the rise While scams have been quiet in the last few months, crypto ATM scams have been increasingly used to carry out scams because transactions made on the machines are difficult and sometimes impossible to trace. As such, crypto ATMs have become one of the best methods that scammers use to steal money from their victims. According to the FBI, about $246.7 million was lost in fraud involving crypto ATMs in 2024. The same stance was echoed by Brian Schwalb, the attorney general of Washington, D.C., who filed a lawsuit against Athena Bitcoin, a major crypto ATM operator, alleging that more than 93% of the deposits on the company’s crypto ATMs were due to a scam. Schwalb noted that Bitcoin ATMs are tools used by scammers and criminals to con hardworking residents of the United States out of their funds. In his lawsuit against Athena, Schwalb alleged that the company charges “undisclosed fees on deposits that it knows are often the result of scams, and for failing to implement adequate anti-fraud measures.” Meanwhile, Athena Bitcoin released a statement calling the allegations ridiculous. The company said it is prepared to contest the charges brought forward against its practices in court. In its statement, Athena Bitcoin said the company employs the best safety measures to protect the financial interests of its users. It also added that its kiosks use multiple safeguards, highlighting the warnings, daily transaction limits, and five separate verification screens that can help stop coerced transactions.

Key Takeaways: Ethereum’s TVL could jump 10× in 2026 as institutions and tokenized assets move on-chain. Stablecoin growth toward $500B is seen as a major driver of Ethereum activity. Ether’s price remains weak despite improving adoption trends. The forecast comes as major financial firms expand their presence on public blockchains and capital flows into tokenized assets accelerate. Sharplink Gaming ranks as the second-largest public Ethereum treasury company, holding 797,704 ETH worth about $2.33 billion, based on Ethereum Treasuries data. Ethereum TVL Poised to Rise as Stablecoin Market Targets $500B Chalom said the next phase of Ethereum’s growth will be driven less by retail speculation and more by stablecoins, tokenized assets, and institutional infrastructure migrating on-chain. In a post on X , Chalom predicted the stablecoin market would reach $500 billion by the end of next year, up from roughly $308 billion today, a gain of about 62%. With more than half of all stablecoin activity currently taking place on Ethereum, he argued that sustained issuance and transaction growth could materially lift the network’s TVL. Beyond stablecoins, Chalom pointed to tokenized real-world assets as a major catalyst. He expects the tokenized RWA market to grow to $300 billion in 2026, describing the shift as a move from isolated products to full-scale fund complexes being represented on-chain. Over the past year, firms such as JPMorgan, Franklin Templeton and BlackRock have expanded pilots and live products tied to tokenization, signaling broader acceptance from traditional finance. Ethereum’s TVL currently stands at around $68.2 billion, according to DeFiLlama. A sharp increase would likely reflect higher institutional engagement rather than speculative DeFi activity alone. Rising TVL is often viewed as a measure of network utility and capital commitment, factors that can shape long-term market confidence. 3/ ETH holdings and tokenization by sovereign wealth funds will increase 5-10X. As onchain activity booms, we’ll see ETH holdings of sovereign wealth funds increase in lock-step as they gain exposure to the “trustware” asset that secures Ethereum, where the majority of the… — Joseph Chalom (@joechalom) December 26, 2025 Price performance, however, has lagged behind the adoption narrative. Ether is down more than 12% over the past 12 months and is trading near $2,924, according to CoinMarketCap. Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen recently said Ether is unlikely to reach new highs in the near term, citing broader market conditions tied to Bitcoin’s cycle. Sovereign Wealth Funds May Boost Ethereum Exposure 5–10× in 2026: Chalom Chalom remains focused on structural demand rather than short-term price action. He expects sovereign wealth funds to increase Ethereum holdings and tokenization exposure by five to ten times over the next year as competitive pressure among large allocators grows. According to him, remaining sidelined was once the safest option, but that calculus is beginning to change. He also expects on-chain AI agents and prediction markets to gain mainstream traction in 2026, adding further activity to Ethereum’s ecosystem. Meanwhile, Peter Thiel-backed ETHZilla has begun unwinding a strategy that once placed it among the most aggressive corporate holders of Ethereum, selling $74.5 million worth of ETH and indicating a clear shift away from a pure crypto treasury model.

The Binance coin price prediction for 2028 projects a maximum price of $5,243.05 and a minimum price of $4,587.67. By 2031, BNB’s price could surge to $8,519.96 with broader acceptance in mainstream finance. After notable changes in its executive team, Binance has shown resilience and prospects for recovery. The departure of Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO, who was also embroiled in legal challenges, initially caused a decline in the value of Binance coin (BNB). Despite this initial setback, the cryptocurrency has shown a positive trend. In September 2020, Binance introduced BNB Smart Chain, which was initially designed for trading and transferring tokens and runs parallel to Binance Chain and What’s next for BNB in the remainder of 2025 and beyond?

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The coin’s price also increased to $839.4 as buying interest surged once again. If traders continue buying, the BNB price might see a further increase and break above $858. On the other hand, a failure in attracting buying demand might result in a correction. In such a case, the price of BNB might head toward the immediate support at $829. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $8,519.96 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB found support, and the price moved toward $839.4, as bulls target $858. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 0.45 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $1000? The BNB price has already crossed $1000 in 2025, and buyers are holding strong to maintain the price above that level. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction , BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on futures trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 by the end of 2026, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $8,519.96 by 2031. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. On September 21, BNB reached the $1,079.07 mark. In October, it hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $1,369.99 and is trading near the $1,100 mark in November. By the end of November, the price of BNB declined below $800. In early December, BNB price triggered a strong bull run toward $900.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-27 08:54:21

Rather than focusing on price targets or market sentiment, Claver centered his message on what he described as facts about the network’s design and capabilities, presenting a case rooted in infrastructure and long-term utility. Claver emphasized that XRP operates on a decentralized network, highlighting that no single entity controls the ledger. He also pointed to its deflationary nature, explaining that a small amount of XRP is permanently removed from circulation with each transaction, a mechanism built into the protocol from the beginning. While the effect is gradual, he describes it as a structural feature that differentiates XRP from inflationary systems. No matter what anyone says, facts don’t change: XRP is decentralized XRP is deflationary The XRPL has a built-in DEX (first launched in 2012) The XRPL supports tokens, stablecoins, and RWAs (first blockchain to introduce tokenization) The XRPL’s features are native to the L1… — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) December 24, 2025 Built-In Features of the XRP Ledger A central part of Claver’s message focused on the XRP Ledger itself. He noted that the XRPL has included a built-in decentralized exchange since 2012, making it one of the earliest blockchains to offer native trading functionality at the base layer. According to his view, this early design choice demonstrated an intent to support real-world financial activity rather than experimental use cases. He further underlined that the XRPL supports the issuance and transfer of tokens, stablecoins, and real-world assets, describing it as the first blockchain to introduce tokenization at this level. Claver stressed that these capabilities are native to the ledger’s Layer 1 architecture, not dependent on external smart contracts. In his assessment, this reduces exposure to risks commonly associated with contract vulnerabilities, wallet drains, and blind signing, which have affected other ecosystems. Liquidity and Market Structure Considerations While Claver’s post focused on fundamentals, responses from other X users added a market perspective. One commenter, known as GCIslander, acknowledged the potential upside for XRP but argued that price appreciation must align with liquidity realities. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He suggested that reaching double-digit prices would require substantial volumes of XRP to be locked through mechanisms such as exchange-traded fund creations and corridor demand. In his view, rapid moves toward much higher price levels in the near term would strain spreads, routing efficiency, and hedging systems across markets. Facts Versus Interpretation Claver concluded his message by drawing a clear line between opinion and what he described as reality, asserting that the characteristics he outlined are factual elements of the XRPL’s design. The varied reactions that followed illustrate how those same features can be interpreted differently, depending on whether the focus is on protocol structure, market mechanics, or long-term economic impact. Together, the exchange reflects the ongoing effort within the digital asset space to balance technological fundamentals with practical financial considerations.

A Penny Crypto Is Targeting $1 In 2026,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/12/best-cryptocurrency-to-invest-today-a-penny-crypto-is-targeting-1-in-2026,"The search for the best cryptocurrency to invest today often leads investors to high-priced assets already deep into their growth cycles. Smart capital usually looks earlier, where real products are being built and demand is still forming. That is exactly where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself. As a new crypto coin still in presale Phase 6, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing growing attention from investors who focus on long-term value rather than short-term noise seen on crypto charts. Currently valued at $0.035, the MUTM token is making waves as it moves through its Phase 6 presale, reflecting a strong 250% increase from its starting price of $0.01. With a fixed total supply of 4 billion tokens and 45.5% allocated to presale, or 1.82 billion tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is structured to reward early participation. The presale follows a staggered pricing model that raises the token price by nearly 20% with every phase, creating clear urgency for investors who understand how early positioning shapes returns. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Real Lending Design Is Driving Demand to $1 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being built as a decentralized, non-custodial lending and borrowing protocol with dual models that address both stability and flexibility. The platform will operate through Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending, each serving a specific role in driving sustainable demand for the MUTM token. In the Peer-to-Contract model, lenders will pool assets such as stablecoins and established cryptocurrencies into audited smart contracts. Borrowers will access this liquidity by providing overcollateralized positions, ensuring protocol stability. Interest rates will dynamically adjust based on pool usage, increasing when demand rises and easing when liquidity is abundant. This mechanism will balance supply and demand while keeping the system solvent. Depositors in this model will receive mtTokens, which will represent their share of the pool along with accrued interest. These mtTokens will also be usable as collateral, allowing users to unlock additional capital without withdrawing their original deposits. Borrowers will be able to select either variable or stable interest rates, offering flexibility depending on market conditions. For assets that carry higher volatility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a dedicated Peer-to-Peer lending environment. Tokens such as PEPE and TRUMP will be isolated from the main liquidity pools to protect overall system health. In this structure, lenders and borrowers will negotiate terms directly, including interest rates and loan durations. The absence of shared pools means higher risk for lenders, but it also opens the door to higher returns, attracting users who actively seek yield opportunities. All loans across both models will be overcollateralized and monitored using a Stability Factor. When collateral values fall below required thresholds, liquidations will be triggered. Liquidators will repurchase debt at a discount, restoring balance to the system while ensuring that losses do not cascade across the protocol. Independent Audit and Ongoing Rewards Adding to growing confidence, the team recently announced on X that Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s lending and borrowing smart contracts are undergoing an independent audit by Halborn Security. With the codebase already finalized, Halborn is actively testing for vulnerabilities, logic flaws, and exploit risks. This process strengthens reliability before launch and signals a professional commitment to security that serious investors expect from long-term platforms. The platform’s incentive structure also reinforces activity. The upgraded 24-hour leaderboard will reward the top daily participant with $500 in MUTM tokens, provided at least one transaction is completed within the timeframe. The leaderboard resets automatically at 00:00 UTC, encouraging continuous engagement and consistent on-chain activity. Liquidity, Volatility, and the Road Toward Adoption Managing liquidity and market volatility sits at the core of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s protocol design. Efficient liquidation depends on sufficient on-chain liquidity, ensuring distressed positions are closed without severe price slippage. When liquidity tightens, higher incentives will be offered to liquidators to maintain coverage and stability. Collateral valuation is directly affected by market volatility. To safeguard solvency, the protocol will apply asset-specific Loan-to-Value ratios and liquidation thresholds. Lower-volatility assets like stablecoins and ETH will support higher LTVs, reaching up to 98%, while more volatile assets will operate within tighter ranges to prevent undercollateralization. Reserve factors will further balance risk, ranging from approximately 10% for stable assets to 55% for higher-risk tokens. As part of its beta rollout, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has announced the launch of its protocol V1 on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. Initial assets will include ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, and collateral. Deploying on a testnet will allow the community to interact with the protocol early, provide feedback, and strengthen trust before broader deployment. As participation expands during testing, awareness and confidence in the ecosystem are expected to rise alongside demand for the MUTM token Deploying V1 on the testnet gives the community an early opportunity to interact with the protocol in real conditions before the mainnet rollout. This phased launch enhances transparency, promotes early user involvement, and allows the team to gather actionable feedback for further development. As participation and awareness grow during the testnet phase, confidence in the project may strengthen, helping to support long-term interest and demand for the MUTM token. For investors scanning crypto charts in search of early-stage opportunities, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a structured, demand-driven project rather than a speculative trend. Phase 6 is already 98% sold out, signaling strong momentum as the presale advances toward its next stage. The upcoming phase will raise the token price by roughly 15%, moving MUTM from $0.035 to $0.040. For those seeking the best cryptocurrency to invest today with an eye on 2026, the closing moments of Phase 6 are where conviction meets timing.

Bitcoin’s volatile price swings have been blamed on a combination of hype, monetary policy, and the notorious four-year ‘halving’ schedule. But a group of academics and analysts in Japan believe they’ve figured out how to detect the signs within blockchain infrastructure before prices plummet. It’s a finding that could reshape how regulators, crypto exchanges, and investors think about risk in a market characterized by extreme volatility. Japanese companies expand bitcoin treasuries In Japan, bitcoin is creeping into corporate investment portfolios and now serves as a long term asset. The publicly listed trading house ANAP went on a bitcoin shopping spree on December 24 and 25, purchasing 109.3551 BTC valued at 1.5 billion JPY ($10 million). It’s been actively promoting crypto assets as a credible business strategy. The purchase brings ANAP Holding’s total bitcoin holdings to 1,346.5856, worth approximately $85 million. “Many companies will see the benefits of holding Bitcoin three to five years from now, and by then, it may already be too late. That’s why we encourage companies to start preparing now,” said ANAP CEO Rintao Kawai at the recent Bitcoin Tokyo Conference. The publicly listed Metaplanet has also become one of Japan’s largest corporate holders of crypto. It has scaled back its original real estate and retail business to focus solely on accumulating bitcoin. It currently holds approximately 30,823 BTC on its balance sheet. The signs are on the blockchain The rise of corporate bitcoin holdings in Japan has turned attention to whether price swings can be anticipated before they strike. In a new study , researchers in Japan say they’ve found evidence that subtle but measurable changes in blockchain transaction networks set the scene for dramatic shifts in crypto prices. The Japanese government-backed think tank, the Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry’s (RIETI) latest paper, identifies precursors to price fluctuations by isolating ‘influential’ nodes that contribute most to the price anomaly. These nodes are specific wallets within the blockchain transaction network that had the greatest impact on a price surge or market abnormalities. Crypto cold feet In October, bitcoin reached a record high of $125,000. The figure then fell to $110,000 at the start of November, erasing a whopping 16.23% of its value. It’s the second worst fall in value after February’s 17.39% decline. Crypto prices differ from bonds and equities as they don’t have a theoretical value. Experts believe that price volatility is often influenced by market psychology and expectations. “Bitcoin reacts less to its own fundamentals. It often acts like a mirror of global anxiety and reacts to stress in the real economy,” explained Rakuten Wallet’s senior analyst Yasuo Matsuda. The latest study by Japanese researchers challenges common narratives around halving. “The impact of halving is easing and price movements are driven more by demand and liquidity than by the Bitcoin-embedded supply cuts,” adds Matsuda. Cornell University economist Eswar Prasad told CNN that retail investors are torn between fear of missing out and a concern over crypto’s price plummeting. He said price swings are not driven by long term core believers. It’s led by short term crowd behaviour. When prices stop rising, many ‘opportunistic’ investors quickly leave. It’s a view echoed by Rintaro Kawai, CEO of ANAP Holdings. “We often see companies buy Bitcoin, only to exit later due to falling prices or pressure from stakeholders. In the end, it gets written off as a loss, which is extremely wasteful.” In fact, analysts and investors look at bitcoin sell-offs as a sign of impending changes in traditional financial markets. “Bitcoin is the first asset investors sell when markets turn defensive. Its volatility makes it a natural early warning signal,” said Matsuda. Crypto markets are shaped by ‘fleeting’ traders who occupy the periphery of the blockchain network. The goal of Japan’s AI blockchain-based detection method is to monitor for these ‘abnormal’ wallets on the chain that amplify bitcoin’s pattern of boom and bust.

The email claimed to be a part of the ‘Holiday Crypto Promotion’ and comes from the legitimate ‘b.grubhub.com’ subdomain. According to reports, the email address is the one GrubHub uses when it wants to communicate with its merchant partners and restaurants. “There are 30 minutes left in our Holiday Crypto Promotion. Grubhub will 10x any Bitcoin sent to this address . For example, if you send $1000, we’ll send back $10,000,” reads the fraudulent message. Some of the emails were delivered from ‘merry-christmas@b.grubhub.com’ and ‘crypto-promotion@b.grubhub.com.’ The emails have been making the rounds since December 24, and they include the names of the recipients. Fake GrubHub promotional email promises users return on crypto The scam is a fake crypto reward campaign being carried out by scammers, where they lure their victims to send funds to wallets under the control of the scammer, promising to send back a larger amount. This type of scam has been seen over the past few years since crypto became mainstream. For instance, scammers take to the comment section of popular figures to promise users more than two-fold returns when they send digital assets to a specified wallet. With the messaging address appearing to take the shape of an original GrubHub email, some users have speculated that the scam messages might be due to a DNS takeover attack. This would allow the attacker to send emails that pass authenticity checks, although the company has yet to provide any in-depth details about the incident. In a statement, a company spokesperson mentioned that it is an isolated problem and they are working to prevent a future occurrence. “We’re aware of unauthorized messages that appear to have been sent by Grubhub to some of our merchant partners. We immediately investigated, contained the issue, and are taking steps to ensure it doesn’t happen again,” Grubhub said. At the beginning of the year, the company announced that a hacker had been able to access a directory that contained names, email addresses, and phone numbers belonging to its customers, merchants, and drivers. FBI issues warnings over increased crime during holidays The company noted at the time that the intrusion was caused by an account used by a third-party to provide support services to GrubHub. Meanwhile, this incident is one of the few that the Federal Bureau of Investigation warned users about a few weeks ago. The federal agency mentioned that scammers would be looking for victims looking to take advantage of the holiday, in turn robbing them of their funds or digital assets. For instance, users looking for holiday discounts may fall into the trap of these bad actors. In addition, the FBI mentioned that other scams include non-delivery scams, where users pay for an item, and they do not receive it, non-payment scams, where users ship goods before payment, and many others. The agency mentioned that users lost more than $785 million to non-payment and non-delivery scams in 2024, adding that credit card fraud accounted for another $199 million in losses to scammers. The FBI says it receives large amounts of complaints in the early months of each year, suggesting that several users had been scammed by bad actors during the festive and holiday period. In view of this, the agency has urged users to refrain from clicking on any links, noting that scammers use phishing links to access people’s personal information. In some other cases, phishing links are used to trick users into using their crypto login on fake websites, which leads to theft. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

The message reflects growing frustration across the sector, where repeated failures and short-lived trends have weakened confidence. Rather than promoting another cycle of speculation, Hoskinson’s comments point toward the need for an industry built on credibility, purpose, and lasting value. “This is the thing that brings crypto back” Charles Hoskinson declared the 3rd generation of crypto dead. Everyone’s tired of beings rugged and scammed. It’s time to do real things. #ada #night #crypto pic.twitter.com/PonSeiIGXI — Jungle Inc Crypto News (@jungleincxrp) December 25, 2025 The End of the Third Generation According to the video shared in Jungle Inc’s post, Hoskinson argues that what he calls the third generation of cryptocurrency has reached its limit. He describes an ecosystem worn down by scandals, rug pulls, and waves of hype that deliver little in terms of real progress. Memecoin and NFT booms are presented as examples of how attention has shifted away from meaningful development toward quick gains. In his view, this pattern has left builders and users disillusioned, with many no longer associating themselves with the sector. Hoskinson suggests that the damage goes beyond market losses. He stresses that people working in crypto want to be able to speak about their work with confidence and respect, particularly in their personal lives, something he believes has become increasingly difficult. A Fourth Generation Built on Privacy and Cooperation Hoskinson’s response to this crisis is what he describes as the fourth generation of crypto. At the center of this vision is Midnight , a platform designed to support rational privacy, selective disclosure, and cooperation across networks. As presented by Jungle Inc, this approach aims to balance decentralization with practical compliance, allowing users and institutions to interact without sacrificing fundamental freedoms. He portrays this shift as necessary to reunite fragmented markets and bring large numbers of new participants into the ecosystem . The focus is on building systems that can function at scale, remain resilient, and serve real economic and social needs rather than speculative trends. Rejecting Hype and Demanding Integrity Another key theme in Hoskinson’s remarks is his rejection of what he sees as a culture driven by hype and value extraction. He criticizes the constant creation of new tokens tied to internet trends, arguing that such behavior rewards short-term profit at the expense of trust. He also speaks against corruption, favoritism, and misleading practices, stating clearly that he has no interest in remaining in an industry that tolerates these behaviors. His message, as reported by Jungle Inc, is that crypto must become something real and meaningful, or risk losing the builders who are capable of delivering long-term progress. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Positioning for a More Serious Industry Hoskinson also points to Cardano’s market standing relative to other privacy-focused projects, presenting it as evidence that commitment to substance is being recognized. He argues that experience and consistency matter in a period when confidence is fragile and credibility is in short supply. Supporting this broader view, a user, Nathaniel Evans, comments that the breakdown of trust in crypto resembles what has already happened in parts of US fintech, where regulation, shrinking funding, and layoffs caused a shift toward more transparent and practical innovation. His observation reinforces the idea that only projects grounded in real utility are likely to survive. Through Jungle Inc’s reporting, Hoskinson’s message comes across as a direct call for reform. It emphasizes that the future of crypto will depend not on the next trend, but on whether the industry can rebuild respect through integrity, cooperation, and work that delivers real-world results.

Cardano (ADA), which was one of the most famous and popular blockchains, loses the support of investors. Its price is also sliding and statistics depict that big holders are selling. Whenever money leaves ADA, it passes down to the projects that have evident development and definite plans. One of these projects is the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which has achieved a significant milestone during presale. This performance makes MUTM one of the best cryptos to purchase today by investors with the long term. Weaknesses are evident at Cardano This has undermined the situation of Cardano. The token trades around $0.36 and has been lingering below some of its crucial levels of prices and this means that there is constant selling pressure. According to on-chain information, big owners, or whales, sold approximately 90 million ADA within a limited period. They contained 100,000 to 100 million ADA in those wallets. The market is overwhelmed with whale selling with prices usually going down. This commercial information corroborates this pessimism. The traders are taking a bet towards a drop in price as indicated by the long-short ratio having a value of less than 1. The fall in the price and sale of whales with bearish trading is the indicator that confidence on ADA is dwindling in the short run. Investors are thus moving their resources to projects which have stronger momentum and have better growth prospects. Mutuum Finance Achieves a Major presale objective When most significant cryptocurrencies are struggling, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is achieving evident, visible milestones. The project has already exceeded over 19.5 million in its presale which shows that it has a great deal of investor interest. More than 18,580 holders have been registered and this shows increased trust. Mutuum Finance is at Presale Phase 6, and the tokens cost 0.035. This is 250% greater compared to Phase 1, but Phase 6 is near full capacity. Phase 7 will begin when it closes where the price is expected to increase by almost 20% to 0.040. The market launch price is fixed to be at $0.06, and the initial buyers will have a good opportunity of making high profits. These dynamics put MUTM in the list of the best crypto investments. Firm Utility and Stability behind the Project Mutuum Finance is actively raising money and actually building tools. The project is building a two layer lending system to facilitate decentralised finance to suit flexible user requirement. It also intends on over-collateralized stablecoin to decrease the fluctuation of prices and to include the stability of the platform. To engage with the users, Mutuum Finance provides a daily leaderboard and live dashboard. The highest contributor on a daily basis is awarded a $500 MUTM bonus. The security is one of the top priorities: the project is being audited by Halborn Security. A Shift in Investor Focus The market sends a clear message that it is easy to focus on the projects that actually progress and have good communities than those that struggle to sell their projects. The success of the pre-sale of the eminent Mutuum Finance proves the increase in confidence and sound performance. MUTM is a powerful, evidence-based, tool that investors would prefer to use when deciding where to invest money in this changing market. As Phase 6 is almost over, the time of purchasing at the existing price is fast running out. Mutuum Finance continues to advance at increasing uncertainty, becoming, therefore, one of the best options between the current choices in the category of the best crypto to invest in at the moment.

Market participants continue to reassess the token as broader crypto assets recover at different speeds. While some investors expect future catalysts to revive interest, others question whether Shiba Inu can regain relevance. As 2026 approaches, uncertainty dominates sentiment around the meme token’s outlook. The crypto market experienced notable shifts in 2025 as macroeconomic pressures, including the United States’ tariff war, weighed on digital assets. Despite these headwinds, Bitcoin and Ethereum reached record highs, with Ethereum rising to $4,953 in August and Bitcoin peaking at $126,198 in October. However, that rally failed to lift most altcoins. Shiba Inu instead fell sharply, sliding to a multi-year low of $0.0000066 after missing widely projected targets near $0.0001. At the time of writing, the memecoin trades at around $0.00000716, down 0.29% in the last 24 hours. SHIB’s price action over the past 24 Hours (Source: CoinCodex ) Bullish Views Center on Regulation and Shibarium Developments Supporters argue that Shiba Inu could benefit from broader regulatory clarity and upcoming technical upgrades. They say the potential passage of the CLARITY Act could reshape the crypto market and encourage institutional participation. In that environment, proponents believe SHIB could attract renewed capital inflows. Bulls also highlight expectations around Zama’s Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology, which developers plan to launch on Shibarium early next year. The upgrade could enable privacy-focused smart contracts and strengthen the network’s utility. Some investors further speculate that Shiba Inu could secure an exchange-traded fund narrative after Coinbase launched regulated SHIB futures. These factors could improve sentiment but stress that execution and adoption remain critical. Structural Concerns Continue to Limit SHIB’s Upside Critics remain cautious, citing unresolved structural challenges. They point out that major initiatives, including Shibarium and partnerships such as K9 Finance, failed to spark sustained price rallies. The developments did not translate into meaningful adoption or demand. Leadership transparency also remains a concern. The Shiba Inu development team continues to operate anonymously more than five years after launch. Community members have reported extended periods of silence from key figures, including Shytoshi Kusama. This issue drew renewed scrutiny after the September Shibarium exploit, when communication reportedly stalled. K9 Finance later disclosed that the team stopped responding about recovering funds stolen during the incident. Supply dynamics further weigh on price potential. More than 589 trillion SHIB tokens remain in circulation, limiting upside momentum. At the same time, daily token burns have slowed to a few million, down from billions earlier in the year. Utility concerns persist as well. Several projects, including SHIB: The Metaverse, a proposed layer-3 privacy network, and an artificial intelligence initiative referenced by Kusama, remain incomplete. Market commentator Neil Patel has cautioned against investing in SHIB, stating that stronger alternatives exist and arguing that the token does not address meaningful real-world problems.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|SECURITY INCIDENTS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-27 09:40:04

Nansen senior research analyst Jake Kennis commented, “We maintain a view that the latter half of 2026 will provide more constructive conditions for risk assets in general, but in the short term, we have a slightly bearish tilt on altcoins until BTC consolidates or forms a bottom.” He declined to give specific 2026 price targets. Still, he identified possible drivers for XRP, including ETF approvals, expansion in global payments, and enhanced bridge asset functionality. XRP may trade close to current levels as the year ends Likewise, Jesus Perez, CEO of Posidonia21 Capital Partners, said XRP could trade sideways toward the end of the year. “We see XRP holding around current levels in a constructive market scenario, rather than initiating a strong new trend,” he said. He added that the asset’s potential for growth will largely depend on its perception by the market and the narrative surrounding it. However, he noted that even with the discussion of staking starting, the lack of a clear yield system still represents a disadvantage compared to other assets. According to X user and crypto trader Niels, XRP is setting a higher low, similar to what we saw in April 2025. Anything over $2 could indicate bullish dominance, he said. Since the beginning of this year, the token has lost 14.63% of its value, currently trading at $1.84, according to CoinMarketCap. Still, spot XRP ETFs in the US had reached $1 billion earlier this month, with Sui Chung of CF Benchmarks attributing the token’s success to its long history and market recognition. Ripple processed $95 billion in payments, yet XRP’s performance lagged Ripple has handled more than $95 billion in payments, but we know from XRP’s 2025 performance that price and adoption are not always complementary. Over the past year or so, XRP has built a case for adoption: more banks on RippleNet means more transactions and higher prices. However, simply building infrastructure doesn’t add value to the token. Clearly, the biggest gains this year went to Ripple Labs and not to holders of XRP. The firm recently received approval for Ripple National Trust Bank, which raised nearly $500 million, valuing it at nearly $40 billion. This month, it also announced that the Monetary Authority of Singapore has allowed a wider range of payment activities under the Major Payment Institution license for its subsidiary, Ripple Markets APAC Pte. Ltd. As a result, it has opened new regulated payment solutions for customers in Singapore. Besides RippleNet partners, such as SBI Holdings , aren’t betting on price appreciation by holding XRP. They use it because it accelerates settlement and reduces costs, which is more important to banks than the token’s market value. Earlier this year, a significant victory for Ripple over regulatory authorities in the United States led to XRP surging to a seven-year high. But the rally was short-lived. The US Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple have told the Second Circuit Court of Appeals that they have agreed to voluntarily dismiss their appeals related to the 2023 ruling, effectively ending the legal battle.

Key Takeaways: Samson Mow and PlanC argue that 2025 marked a stealth bear market, setting the stage for a Bitcoin bull run. Other analysts remain skeptical, warning that Bitcoin’s $125,100 peak could signal a new bear market. Bitcoin is nearing a rare down year that some see as a historical anomaly. In a post on X on Friday , Mow said 2025 effectively served as Bitcoin’s bear market and that the conditions are now in place for a sustained advance lasting into 2035. “2025 was the bear market,” Mow wrote, adding that Bitcoin could be entering a “decade long bull run.” His view w as echoed by analyst PlanC , who said investors who endured the year had already weathered the worst of the cycle. Analysts Warn Bitcoin’s $125K Peak May Signal New Bear Market in 2026 The outlook contrasts sharply with other forecasts that point to October’s all-time high of $125,100 as the peak of the current cycle. Some analysts argue that 2026 could usher in a fresh bear market as macro conditions tighten and speculative demand fades. Bitcoin is currently trading at around $87,200, down nearly 9% since the start of the year, according to CoinMarketCap. The asset is on pace to close the year in the red, a rarity in Bitcoin’s trading history. PlanC noted that Bitcoin has never posted two consecutive annual declines, framing the current weakness as an anomaly rather than a trend reversal. Price performance has fallen short of bullish projections made earlier in the year. 2025 was the bear market. https://t.co/1ganX0YSbI — Samson Mow (@Excellion) December 26, 2025 In October, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes and BitMine chair Tom Lee suggested Bitcoin could still climb to $250,000 before year-end. Instead, Bitcoin is down about 3% over the past 30 days, with sentiment deteriorating through December. Market psychology reflects that pressure. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index fell to a reading of 20 out of 100 on Dec. 26, extending a stretch of “extreme fear” that began earlier in the month. Analysts Warn Bitcoin Could Fall to $60K–$65K in 2026 Looking ahead to 2026, the industry remains divided. Fidelity’s director of global macro research, Jurrien Timmer, has suggested 2026 could be a pause year, with prices potentially sliding toward $65,000. Others remain more optimistic. Strategy CEO Phong Le has argued that Bitcoin’s underlying fundamentals held up throughout 2025 despite weaker prices, while Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said earlier this year that he expects 2026 to be an “up year” for the asset. According to Linh Tran, market analyst at XS.com, Bitcoin’s recent price action underscores the market’s sensitivity to monetary policy expectations rather than headline economic data. While US inflation has eased from last year’s highs, the latest consumer price index reading of 2.7% suggests that the disinflation process remains slow and uneven, forcing “the Fed to maintain a cautious stance, making it difficult to pivot quickly toward an aggressive easing cycle,” Tran said in a note shared with Cryptonews.com. Last week, K33 also said Bitcoin’s prolonged sell-side pressure from long-term holders may be approaching its limits after years of steady distribution.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing attention because it is still early in its lifecycle while already outlining a clear, utility-driven DeFi framework. For investors looking for the best crypto with near-term momentum and long-term demand logic, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a project built for growth, not hype. Importance of Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Presale Phase 6, which places today’s buyers at a stage where most of the early groundwork is already validated, yet pricing remains discounted compared to later phases. The MUTM token has a fixed total supply of 4 billion tokens, with 45.5% allocated to the presale, equal to roughly 1.82 billion tokens. The presale began in early 2025 at $0.01 per token and followed a structured progression, with each phase increasing by 10–20%. This gradual pricing model was designed to reward early participation while maintaining clarity for new entrants. Phase 6 is now 98% sold out, with the token priced at $0.035 and almost fully allocated. More than 18,600 holders have already participated across the presale phases, using both crypto and card payment options. As Phase 6 closes, token distribution will advance into the next roadmap-defined stage, where the price will increase to $0.040, representing a 15% jump from the current level. This positioning places today’s entry among the last chances to access MUTM at its present valuation. A Dual Lending Architecture Built for Real Usage Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being developed as a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol that supports both peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer lending. This dual structure is important because it expands the range of assets and strategies users will be able to access. The peer-to-contract side will focus on liquidity pools that enable predictable lending and borrowing, while the peer-to-peer side will allow direct matching between users, opening the door to assets that are often excluded from traditional DeFi platforms. The project has confirmed through its official X channel that the first version of the protocol is scheduled to launch on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. This deployment will introduce the core infrastructure, including liquidity pools, mtToken and debt-token systems, and an automated liquidation bot designed to protect collateral and keep the protocol operating smoothly. During this stage, users will be able to engage in lending and borrowing using ETH or USDT as collateral. Launching on a testnet first will allow early interaction, transparent testing, and meaningful community feedback, all of which will strengthen confidence ahead of future stages. Security is another pillar supporting Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The team has announced that an independent audit by Halborn Security is underway for its lending and borrowing smart contracts. With the code finalized, this review will ensure the contracts function correctly, resist vulnerabilities, and meet professional security standards. A completed audit will reinforce trust, reduce technical risk, and confirm that the protocol is being built with long-term sustainability in mind. 10X Growth Is Possible: Stablecoin Design and Price Accuracy as Growth Engines One of the strongest growth drivers for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its planned decentralized stablecoin. This stablecoin will always aim to maintain a value of $1 and will only be minted when users borrow against overcollateralized assets such as ETH. When loans are repaid or liquidated, the stablecoin will be burned, keeping supply tightly controlled. Only approved issuers, including specific smart contracts, will have the authority to mint, each within defined limits that manage systemic risk. Borrowing rates for this stablecoin will be governed to support price stability rather than reacting blindly to market pressure. When the price moves above $1, rates will be adjusted downward, and when it falls below $1, rates will rise. Arbitrage activity will further reinforce balance, as traders act on price deviations to restore equilibrium. Because all positions will be overcollateralized and subject to automatic liquidation, the system will preserve value while keeping risk contained. This stablecoin will serve as a reliable medium of exchange and a secure store for idle capital within the protocol. By anchoring both peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer markets, the stablecoin will create recurring borrowing and lending flows that circulate liquidity internally. Stablecoins form the backbone of DeFi activity, and a controlled, overcollateralized design will drive consistent engagement. As usage expands, demand for MUTM will increase because the token underpins governance, incentives, and economic alignment across the ecosystem. Equally important is accurate price discovery. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to rely on robust oracle infrastructure to determine fair asset values. Its roadmap anticipates integration with Chainlink data feeds, providing reliable pricing in USD and native assets across multiple chains. To ensure resilience, the protocol design includes fallback oracles that will activate during outages, aggregated feeds that reduce reliance on a single source, and on-chain metrics such as time-weighted average prices from decentralized exchanges when sufficient liquidity exists. This layered pricing approach will reduce erroneous liquidations and manipulation risks. Reliable valuations will encourage larger and longer-term positions, increase protocol usage, and generate durable fees. Those fees will strengthen the treasury and reinforce MUTM’s role within the platform’s economic cycle, creating a clear path from usage to token demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioned at a point where structure, security, and timing align. With Presale Phase 6 already 98% sold out and the next phase bringing a confirmed price increase to $0.040, the current window represents the last opportunity to access MUTM at $0.035. Backed by a dual lending model, a purpose-built stablecoin, audited smart contracts, and a clear testnet launch timeline, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a compelling case as the best crypto for investors seeking a disciplined crypto investment with a realistic path to a quick 10x driven by real demand-driven mechanics rather than speculation alone.

Crypto researcher SMQKE emphasizes that understanding XRP begins with recognizing how its use in real financial processes shapes demand and, by extension, its market value. The focus is on practical application, where price behavior reflects extensive usage of the asset rather than trading frequency. SMQKE highlights that this view is reinforced by XRP’s fixed supply. With 100 billion tokens created at inception and no mechanism for additional issuance under the protocol, XRP operates within a strictly defined supply structure. As network usage expands and more participants rely on XRP for operational purposes, demand must be met from this existing pool, establishing the basis for potential long-term price appreciation driven by adoption rather than speculation. To clear up any misunderstandings: XRP’s price is driven by utility, not hype. It has a fixed supply, with growing demand tied to its role in network security and as a bridge currency as Ripple adoption expands. Ripple’s business model is built on this reality, where… pic.twitter.com/J5nKDUhWyR — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) December 24, 2025 Network Security and Economic Demand One of the primary roles highlighted is XRP’s function in securing the network. Small fees denominated in XRP are required for transactions, and these fees are permanently destroyed. This mechanism discourages spam and denial-of-service attacks while ensuring that the network remains efficient and resilient. In addition, reserve requirements mandate that accounts and certain activities hold a minimum amount of XRP, creating a baseline level of demand connected directly to network participation. SMQKE points out that these design choices mean XRP is not merely a passive unit of exchange. It becomes an integral part of maintaining the health and integrity of the ledger. As activity increases, so too does the need for XRP to meet these operational requirements, reinforcing the connection between usage and demand. XRP as a Bridge Currency Beyond security, XRP’s role as a bridge currency is central to the thesis presented. In cross-border payments, XRP can be used to facilitate rapid value transfer between different fiat currencies, reducing reliance on pre-funded accounts and lowering settlement times. This utility positions XRP as a liquidity tool for institutions seeking efficiency in global payments. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 SMQKE emphasizes that as more entities adopt systems built around the Ripple protocol, the demand for XRP increases with transaction volume. Each additional corridor or payment flow potentially adds to the requirement for liquidity, further embedding XRP into real-world financial processes. Ripple’s Business Model and Adoption The tweet also underscores that Ripple’s business strategy aligns with this utility-based approach. The model assumes that greater adoption of the protocol will naturally increase the need for XRP, given its roles in security and bridging . Rather than relying on promotional narratives, the expectation is that practical use by banks, payment providers, and enterprises will drive organic demand. SMQKE’s analysis presents XRP as an asset whose value proposition relies on function, structure, and adoption.

United States investigators claimed that for years, he has moved money for the Kim Jong-un regime, laundering stolen cryptocurrency across borders and purchasing items on behalf of the country. The FBI has announced a $7 million bounty on Hyon-sop, noting that he has been playing a central role in laundering the digital assets stolen by North Korean IT workers and hackers , exchanging them for cash and using them to purchase goods beneficial to the Pyongyang regime. FBI declares North Korean launderer wanted According to the FBI, Sim is among the North Korean bankers operating outside the country, with the federal agency highlighting that he has been operating in the Middle East under aliases such as Sim Ali or Sim Hajim. He graduated from one of the most elite universities in the country and is known to be fluent in English and Chinese. At some point, he was sent overseas as the head of a subsidiary of North Korea’s Foreign Trade Bank before working in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Ryu Hyun-woo, a former acting chargé d’affaires at the North Korean Embassy in Kuwait, mentioned that he met Sim more than ten times while working in the country. Ryu, who defected in 2019, mentioned that SIM would usually pick him up in a Toyota Land Cruiser, and they would frequently dine with other North Korean operatives. He also added that Sim once described how he launders money, including how he moved it between countries. The defector added that Sim highlighted other parts of his operations, including how he used shell companies for his benefit and paid brokers to obscure the sources of the funds. Ryu added that many North Koreans worked in the UAE as computer programmers while others stole digital assets on the side, noting that someone had to handle the funds that they got from their operations. Profits earned were sent to Sim in crypto, before being moved through several wallets to obscure the origins. The report mentioned that once the origins are obscured, SIM then transfers the funds to brokers in the UAE or China. The brokers then convert the digital assets into cash and deposit them into bank accounts opened in the names of the shell companies. Sim then uses the funds to purchase goods for the North Korean regime, a move that they believe would help them evade international sanctions by ensuring cash is not moved directly into bank accounts owned by North Korea. $7 million reward for information leading to Sim’s arrest The items Sim allegedly purchased for the country included raw materials used to produce counterfeit cigarettes bearing brands like Marlboro, communications equipment, and even helicopters. Sim is believed to have lived a lavish lifestyle with his cut from the illicit proceeds. However, the illicit funds attracted scrutiny when they passed through the payment systems of major United States banks like Citibank and JPMorgan Chase, and European banks like HSBC. Reports claimed that in one of his schemes, Sim used United States banks to allegedly process more than 310 transactions worth $74 million for North Korea. The UAE revoked Sim’s residency visa in 2019 in line with UN sanctions against North Korea, even though his departure was delayed by three years due to the pandemic. The FBI has since promised $7 million for information leading to Sim’s arrest. SIM is wanted on charges including conspiracy to commit bank fraud, money laundering, and evasion of sanctions against North Korea. His whereabouts remain unknown, but the Treasury Department believes that he traveled to Dandong, a Chinese border city, after being expelled from the UAE, although it has not been confirmed. “China is unaware of Sim’s activities and is opposed to what it sees as unilateral U.S. Treasury sanctions,” Beijing’s Foreign Ministry said.

A word that seems to be on everyone's lips. No matter where you go, you hear what feels like almost a chant of crypto, crypto, crypto. People seem to be super interested in it but why is that? What is it about crypto that seems to attract people from all across the world? It could be its versatility or even its transparency. Then again, it could also be the heightened safety and security. It's tricky to know just what it's about but one thing is for sure, it's popular. Don't believe it? Well, then, just let the figures speak for themselves. The UK cryptocurrency market is projected to reach a revenue of approximately US$2.9 billion by 2025, with an anticipated 30.10 million users by 2026. And do you know which market it's impacting rather significantly? Yes, you guessed it correctly, the online gambling market. When online gambling became more common, online payment methods were scrambling to keep up with all of the demand. More and more digital payment methods were starting to come about and a major player in these options is cryptocurrency. Online casinos and sportsbooks truly started to accept cryptocurrencies more and more. And these are not small markets. The UK's online gambling market is a significant and growing sector, valued at approximately USD 8.7 billion in 2024 and online sports betting is a major segment of the UK's gambling industry, with a projected revenue of US$6.72 billion in 2025. See? These are already massive markets and bringing in the cryptocurrency option has only given these markets even more chance to thrive. Why Online Casinos and Sportsbooks are Embracing Crypto Online gambling platforms didn’t adopt crypto just to look modern. There are real operational reasons behind the shift. Traditional banking systems come with delays, fees and geographic limitations. Crypto offers a way around many of those pain points. For casinos and sportsbooks, crypto payments can reduce friction. Transactions don’t rely on banks approving or rejecting payments. Funds move directly between wallets, which can lower costs and speed things up significantly. From a player's perspective, crypto often feels more convenient. Deposits usually clear faster, withdrawals can take minutes instead of days and there’s often less paperwork involved at the payment stage. Some of the main reasons platforms are adopting crypto include faster deposits and withdrawals compared to cards or bank transfers, lower transaction fees in many cases, access to international players without currency conversion issues and reduced reliance on traditional financial institutions. For you, this often translates into quicker access to winnings and fewer interruptions when funding an account. That kind of experience matters in an industry built around instant entertainment. Speed and Efficiency Change How Players Engage with the Game Speed is one of the biggest reasons crypto has gained traction in online gambling. Waiting days for withdrawals can drain excitement and trust. Crypto shortens that gap dramatically. When you use Bitcoin, Ethereum or stablecoins, transactions can be processed in minutes. That changes how you interact with platforms. You’re more likely to move funds when you want to, rather than planning around banking delays. Fast payments also encourage shorter, more flexible play sessions. Instead of locking money into an account, you can deposit, play, withdraw and move on without feeling stuck. You might notice benefits like near-instant deposits, withdrawals processed the same day or faster, no waiting for bank approval windows and fewer interruptions during live betting or casino sessions. This efficiency makes crypto particularly appealing for live casino games and in-play sports betting, where timing matters. But it also depends on the specific cryptocurrency you go for. For example, Bitcoin's global market cap exceeds £1.2 trillion, with significant UK trading volume in GBP. But overall, around 7 million UK adults, so 12% of adults, owned crypto in 2024, a rise from 4.4% in 2021, though slightly down from a 2022 high. The UK crypto market turnover was around £24.2 billion, with growing investment, according to The Data City. Borderless Transactions Open Global Access For All One of crypto’s biggest advantages is that it doesn’t care about borders. Traditional gambling payments often depend on where you live, what currency you use and how your bank handles gambling-related transactions. Crypto removes many of those barriers. Whether you’re betting from Europe, Asia or elsewhere, a crypto wallet works the same way. You just need to make sure that the online operating site you're interested in is actually onethat accepts this kind of currency. You should use reputable casinos with crypto payments so that you can be sure that each and every one of your transactions is as reliable and safe as possible. The good thing about crypto is that it's global, as is online gambling. For platforms, this global reach expands their audience. For you, it means fewer restrictions and more consistency. Borderless payments bring benefits such as: • No currency exchange hassles• Fewer blocked transactions• Easier access to international platforms• Consistent payment experience regardless of location This doesn’t mean regulation disappears but it does mean fewer technical obstacles standing between you and your bankroll. And this is going to make this market even bigger than it already is. Statista projects UK crypto users to reach 30.1 million by 2026. Lower Fees Make a Noticeable Difference Over Time Fees might seem small on individual transactions but they add up. Credit cards, e-wallets and bank transfers all take their share. Crypto transactions often come with lower fees, especially when compared to international payments. For frequent players, this can have a real impact. Saving a few percent on deposits and withdrawals adds up over months or years. That said, fees vary depending on the blockchain used. You see, Bitcoin and Ethereum can become expensive during busy periods. Stablecoins running on efficient networks often offer the best balance between cost and speed. Lower fees can mean: • More of your money stays in play• Fewer hidden costs on withdrawals• Better value for high-frequency bettors This is one reason stablecoins have become particularly popular in gambling environments. Stablecoins Bring Predictability to Crypto Gambling Volatility is one of crypto’s biggest challenges, especially in gambling. Betting already involves risk. Adding wild price swings on top of that can feel uncomfortable. Stablecoins like USDT and USDC solve part of that problem. These tokens are pegged to fiat currencies, usually the US dollar, which keeps their value relatively stable. When you gamble using stablecoins, you don’t have to worry about your balance dropping because the market dipped overnight. What you win or lose reflects your betting results, not market fluctuations. Stablecoins are often preferred because values remain consistent, there is easier bankroll management, you have reduced exposure to crypto price swing and there is familiar dollar-based thinking. This stability makes stablecoins especially appealing for players who want crypto’s speed without its unpredictability. Privacy and Control Attract a New Type of Player Image source: https://unsplash.com/photos/person-using-desktop-computer-WcrqKjgMPfI Cryptocurrency offers a level of financial control that traditional payment methods don’t. Funds are held in your wallet, not a bank. Transactions don’t require sharing card details with multiple platforms. For some players, this feels empowering. You’re not relying on banks that might flag or restrict gambling transactions. You’re also reducing how much personal information gets passed around during payments. That said, privacy isn’t absolute. Many licensed gambling platforms still require identity verification. Crypto doesn’t eliminate those requirements but it can streamline the payment side. Crypto appeals to players who value greater control over funds, fewer intermediaries, reduced exposure of banking details and more transparency over transactions. Regulation and Compliance Remain Unavoidable While crypto brings freedom, it doesn’t exist outside the law. Online gambling platforms still operate within regulatory frameworks. Anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules are increasingly applied to crypto transactions. For you, this means crypto gambling isn’t anonymous in the way it once was portrayed. Licensed platforms still ask for verification, especially when you withdraw larger amounts. Regulators are paying closer attention to crypto gambling because of its cross-border nature. Expect stricter rules, clearer reporting standards and closer monitoring in the coming years. Challenges related to regulation include: • Increased identity checks• Transaction monitoring• Reporting requirements for platforms• Differences in crypto laws between countries These measures aim to protect players and prevent misuse but they also shape how crypto gambling evolves. User Experience Continues to Improve and You Can See the Changes Early crypto gambling platforms often felt clunky and technical. Wallet setups, long addresses and manual confirmations could be intimidating. That’s changed significantly. Modern platforms integrate crypto smoothly. Wallet connections are simpler. Stablecoin balances display clearly. Payment instructions are more user-friendly. As the experience improves, crypto stops feeling like a specialist option and starts feeling mainstream. You might notice improvements such as clear balance displays in familiar currencies, simple deposit and withdrawal steps, faster confirmations and status updates and better customer support around crypto payments. Trends Shaping the Next Phase of Crypto Gambling Crypto gambling isn’t standing still. Several trends suggest how things may develop further. Platforms are experimenting with blockchain-based games, provably fair systems and decentralised betting models. These approaches aim to increase transparency and trust. You may also see more stablecoin-focused platforms, layer-two solutions for faster and cheaper transactions, tighter integration between wallets and gambling apps and increased use of blockchain for game verification. At the same time, regulators will continue refining rules, pushing the industry toward clearer standards and safer practices. What This Means For you as a Player and Key Things to Keep in Mind Crypto is no longer just an alternative payment method in online gambling. It’s becoming a core part of how platforms operate and how players interact with them. For you, the key is balance. Crypto offers speed, flexibility and lower fees but it also comes with learning curves and regulatory considerations. Understanding how crypto fits into online gambling helps you choose platforms more confidently and manage your bankroll more effectively. As adoption grows, crypto is likely to shape not just payments but the overall structure of online gambling itself. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The movement represents a notable shift in token distribution patterns and removes a significant portion of readily available supply from active trading venues. Exchange outflow data confirms the scale of the withdrawal. The tokens have departed platforms where they would typically remain accessible for immediate sale. This redistribution suggests a change in holder behavior at current price levels. Understanding the Withdrawal Pattern Large-scale exchange outflows typically signal one of three scenarios. Tokens may move into long-term storage as part of accumulation strategies. Holders might transfer assets to cold wallets for enhanced security. Major stakeholders could also be reorganizing their holdings through internal wallet restructuring. The magnitude and consistency of this negative netflow point toward genuine accumulation rather than simple wallet transfers. Market participants preparing to liquidate positions would normally increase exchange deposits, not reduce them. The opposite is occurring. Selling pressure is diminishing at present valuation levels. Traders willing to offload tokens at current prices are becoming scarcer. This shift in supply dynamics creates a different market structure than what existed during heavier selling periods. The data does not guarantee an immediate price surge. However, it fundamentally alters the supply side of the equation. Less available inventory on exchanges means fewer tokens positioned for quick sales. Technical Indicators Show Compression Phase Price charts reflect a market in transition rather than active bullish momentum. SHIB continues to trade below key moving averages and remains within an established downtrend. Yet the angle of that downtrend has flattened considerably. Recent price action displays compression characteristics. Volatility has contracted. Lower lows have become infrequent. Momentum indicators rest in oversold zones without triggering panic-driven selloffs. SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingView This technical setup resembles late-stage bearish exhaustion. The pattern suggests selling pressure has largely run its course without yet establishing clear bullish conviction. Markets often consolidate in this manner before directional moves emerge. The combination of reduced exchange supply and technical compression creates asymmetric potential. Downside risk appears limited by exhaustion selling. Upside potential increases because less supply stands ready to meet any demand surge. At the time of writing, SHIB trades at around $0.00000716, suggesting a 0.67% decline in the last 24 hours.

In 2027, it will range between $0.46 and $0.56, with an average price of $0.48. In 2030, it will range between $1.44 and $1.74, with an average price of $1.49. Unlike the common sentiment of being a meme token, ApeCoin (APE) has utility. APE is the native token of ApeChain. The token also has utility within an affiliated company, Yuga Labs, the firm behind the Otherside metaverse, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) NFTs. Will APE reach $1? What will its price be in 2026? Let’s explore these and more in the Cryptopolitan Price Prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency ApeCoin Symbol APE Current price $0.2040 Market cap $153.55M Trading volume $12.24M Circulating supply 752.65M All-time high $39.40 on March 17, 2022 All-time low $0.1624 on Oct 11, 2025 24-hour high $0.2067 24-hour low $0.1997 APE price analysis: Technical indicators Metric Value Price volatility 10.24% 50-day SMA $0.2799 200-day SMA $0.4749 Sentiment Bearish Green days 10/30 (33%) Fear and Greed Index 23 (Extreme Fear) APE price analysis At the time of writing (December 27), APE’s price rose by 0.70% in the past 24 hours, aligning with the broader cryptocurrency market, which is down 0.80%. The coin lost 25.88% of its value in the last 30 days. Its trading volume dropped by 40.22% in 24 hours, indicating a lack of market conviction. APE/USD 1-day chart analysis APEUSD chart by TradingView APE fell below $1 in January and $0.5 in April. This month, it trades below the $0.21 mark after a sharp decline over the last few months. The MACD histogram indicates its positive momentum rose over the last 7 days. Its volatility dropped over the same period. APE/USD 4-hour chart analysis APEUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart highlights APE’s run this week. The coin remained neutral with a few failed recovery attempts.

Over the short term, APE’s price analysis indicates that APE is neutral, as its positive momentum slows the recent drop. The Fear and Greed Index shows an extreme fear sentiment among traders. Falling trading volumes confirm low conviction in the market trend. Why is APE down? APE’s rally reflects NFT sector tailwinds as the BAYC market cap surged, event-driven speculation, and technical momentum. Can ApeCoin reach $1? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, APE will break above $10 in 2029, driven by the growing utility and applications, such as in the metaverse. Will APE reach $100? It is unlikely that the APE price will be extended to $100 in the foreseeable future. At such a valuation, APE will be more valuable than the USDT stablecoin, which is more of a ‘household’ cryptocurrency. Can ape coin hit $1000? It is unlikely that the APE price will reach $1000 before 2031. Does ApeCoin have a future? With the launch of ApeChain, ApeCoin now has more utility and is, therefore, much more likely to last into the future. How much is ApeCoin worth in 2025? For 2025, the APE coin price will range between $0.20 and $0.23. The average price for the year will be $0.22. Is APE a good investment? APE’s utility is growing, and the launch of ApeChain is anticipated to attract more projects that use the APE token either for governance or settling fees on the chain. Yuga Labs and other new firms will likely promote APE. Recent news While Solana’s low fees attracted new users, the dissolution of ApeCoin DAO (99.66% approval) alienated decentralization advocates. ApeCo’s 10M APE treasury allocation ($3.72M) added inflationary pressure.

Companies will have to tell users when they’re interacting with machines and follow strict guidelines on content and security. The proposed regulations would make provider s no tify people they’re using AI when they first log in and again every two hours. They’d also need to warn users if the system detect s th ey might be relying on it too much. The Cyberspace Administration of China posted the draft rules on Saturday for public review. Comments are being accepted until Jan. 25. Companies offering human-like AI must set up strong security checks and ethics reviews. The system s al so need to follow what the government calls “core socialist values” and can’t share anything that threatens national security. China balances AI growth with tight controls The move shows China’s approach to AI development. The country is pushing hard on the technology to help the economy grow and compete worldwide. As reported by Cryptopolitan previously Nvidia boss Jensen Huang said China will leave U.S. behind in AI race. However, officials also want tight control to prevent disruptions to security or social order. So what do the new AI governance rules require? Companies must complete a security review and send a report to provincial internet regulators before launching any human-like AI features. They’d also need to file reports if their service reaches 1 million registered users or 100,000 monthly active users. Many people focus on which country will build the most advanced AI models. But Beijing has already taken the lead in a different area: creating global rules for how AI should work. This effort worries people who care about free speech because Beijing has spent years trying to influence international technology standards and promoting strict internet controls. China released its Global AI Governance Action Plan on earlier this year on July 26. The detailed strategy tries to make Beijin g th e main voice in setting international AI rules. It includes proposals like the World Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Organization. Beijing says AI should be a “public good for the international community” managed for “safety” and shared benefits. Democratic countries have reasons to doubt China’s plans for global AI governance. China already blocks massive amounts of online content through its Great Firewall. Experts say similar controls now apply to AI. Anyone using DeepSeek, a major Chinese AI model, can see how it refuses to discuss topics the government considers sensitive. China r anks last in f ree speech protections Research released in October compared AI policies in six countries. China ranked dead last among major AI nations when it came to protecting free speech in AI. The United States, European Union, Brazil, South Korea, and India all scored better. The findings match what users already know. China’s Communist Party shapes AI in the country to match its political goals and social limits. Beijing bu ilt a complicated network of government rules and company requirements that work together as a governance system. That’s different from the European Union, which passed one main AI law called the AI Act. The country’s main regulation for AI that creates content is called Interim Measures for the Management of Generative AI Services. It requires companies to support “core socialist values” and block content that might challenge government power, encourage breaking away from China, or disturb economic and social order. The same regulation says training data must meet strict political standards. While officially calling for “truth,” “accuracy,” and “objectivity,” the rules actually mean companies can’t use data that challenges the current system, damages China’s reputation, creates “harmful” information, or goes against social customs, ethics, or morality.

According to reports, the creators claimed that the new tool could be used to modify others’ works without their consent. Reports claimed that the exodus is being led by high-profile artists who have highlighted fears over the rise of intellectual property theft and the potential for harassment through Elon Musk’s Grok AI integration. The feature is a new “Edit Image” tab that enables any user to select a public image and issue a command to the chatbot via command texts to alter it any way they wish. The Grok AI then generates a new version, which can either be reposted or sent back to the original creator as a reply. Artists leave X in droves over new image editing feature One such popular creator championing the boycott is Mu-jik Park, the renowned South Korean artist known by the pen name Boichi. Boichi is the creator of the hit manga series Dr Stone and Sun-Ken Rock. In a public statement, Park announced that he will be leaving the platform indefinitely. “It is with a heavy and broken heart that I write these words. For the time being, I will pause the publication of my comics and illustrations on X,” Boichi said. Boichi mentioned that the decision stems from the newly updated edit image feature on X, clearing things in an attached statement. He highlighted that he was not afraid of AI, noting that he believes in its future and potential. However, he noted that he cannot accept the fact that his works are being used, learned from, or exploited without his consent or proper compensation. He urged his users to follow his Instagram page, noting that he will share them on the platform instead. Boichi told his followers that he had no plans to leave X, as he would continue to update them on the platform. He also added that he will wait for the day when normalcy is restored on the platform so that he can continue sharing his works with his followers. His statement was met with words of encouragement from his followers. Some promised to be active on his page on Instagram, while others promised to follow his works across other platforms. Artists kick against art manipulation with AI The tension reached a breaking point after an incident involving an artist on X with the account name Iomaya. After posting a paid commissioned art, which was flagged as adult content and had its visibility limited, the work was then hijacked by an anonymous user and altered using the Grok AI tool. In the modified image, the user wrote the word “Luddite,” a word used to describe those who opposed technological progress across the character’s abdomen. According to reports, the AI-generated versions of art processed using the chatbot have seen users strip away watermarks added by the artists. In Iomaya’s case, the user went on to describe the image as low-quality AI content. In a statement, Iomaya mentioned that art on X is over, noting that what the anonymous user did to it was disgusting beyond words. The thread has since garnered more than five million views after going viral. In addition, the post has seen more than 15,000 reposts and gathered a wave of support from well-wishers and the global creative community on X. The account responsible for manipulating the picture, El3v3nDimesion, appeared to have been targeting multiple creatives and manipulating their works for fun. According to reports, the account, which has now been deactivated, believes that creatives should embrace AI to make art.

Our Pi network price prediction anticipates the Pi price to reach a maximum level of $0.35 by 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $3.14. Pi Network, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan, is a social crypto and developer ecosystem built for real-world utility and mass accessibility. 2025 has been a defining stress test: Pi surged to about $2.98 in February, crashed to a new all-time low of $0.1585 on October 11, and now trades near $0.22 in early December, highlighting extreme volatility as the year closes. But basic building blocks continue to keep investor interest alive, including the Passkey security improvement to Pi Wallet, Pi DEX, and AMM on Testnet, Pi Network Ventures pushing towards decentralization and AI with OpenMind, and millions of new KYC verifications and continuing projects such as the 2025 Pi Hackathon and Sign Protocol partnership. In this Pi Network price prediction, we discuss these developments with major technical levels and the model of exponential supply of Pi that is in decline to determine whether 2025–2031 favors a sustained recovery or further downside.

The daily RSI is at 40.6, still below the midline, while the MACD remains below zero, indicating weak momentum and a lack of strong buying pressure. Key support sits between $0.203–$0.200, while resistance now stands between $0.207, then $0.215, and $0.22 As of December 27, 2025, Pi Network is trading sideways today, with price holding in a tight range just above the $0.20 level as buying and selling pressure remain balanced. The Price is holding near $0.2045, with a market cap of around $1.7 billion, and Volume is lighter today at about $7.9 million, suggesting reduced selling pressure and also limited buyer conviction. The market remains calm, with Pi stabilizing rather than showing a clear upward trend. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis The 1-day chart shows a small-bodied candle, reflecting consolidation rather than continuation of the prior sell-off. After reclaiming the $0.20 level earlier this week, Pi has managed to hold above it, indicating short-term stability. However, the broader structure still shows lower highs, meaning the recovery lacks strength. The RSI (14) is currently at 40.58, with its signal line near 38.86. This keeps momentum below the neutral 50 level, confirming that buyers are cautious. While selling pressure has eased, RSI must move back above 45 or 50 to signal improving momentum. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView On the MACD (12, 26), the MACD line is near –0.0058, the signal line around –0.0065, and the histogram is slightly positive at +0.0007. Both MACD lines remain below the zero line, which means the trend is still bearish. However, the small positive histogram shows that downside momentum is slowing rather than accelerating. Support is clearly defined at $0.203, followed by the key psychological level at $0.20. A break below $0.20 would increase downside risk. On the upside, resistance is at $0.207, with a stronger barrier near $0.215. A daily close above $0.215 would strengthen the case for a short-term recovery. Pi/USD 4-Hour Price Analysis On the 4-hour chart, Pi is trading around $0.2040, slightly lower on the session after failing to build momentum above the $0.205 and $0.206 area. Price action is tight and sideways, with candles clustering around the $0.20 and $0.205 zone, showing that neither buyers nor sellers are in control right now. The RSI (14) is at 45.07, with its signal line around 50.63, keeping momentum below neutral. This suggests mild weakness but not oversold conditions, indicating limited selling pressure and a lack of strong buying interest. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView On the MACD (12, 26), the MACD line is at -0.0001, the signal line is also around -0.0001, and the histogram is flat near 0.0000. Both MACD and signal lines remain below the zero line, which means the broader short-term trend is still bearish. However, the flat histogram shows that downside momentum is very weak and selling pressure is fading rather than accelerating. Support on the 4-hour timeframe is holding near $0.200 and $0.202, while resistance sits around $0.205 and $0.208. A clean move above $0.208 could signal short-term recovery, while a break below $0.20 would shift focus back to downside risk. Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.2984 SELL SMA 5 $0.2746 SELL SMA 10 $0.2590 SELL SMA 21 $0.2456 SELL SMA 50 $0.2348 SELL SMA 100 $0.2800 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.2383 SELL EMA 5 $0.2426 SELL EMA 10 $0.2650 SELL EMA 21 $0.3013 SELL EMA 50 $0.3603 SELL EMA 100 $0.4533 SELL What to expect from the Pi price analysis next? Pi is likely to remain range-bound in the near term, with price between the $0.20 support and the $0.21–$0.22 resistance as momentum indicators stay neutral to slightly weak. A sustained move above $0.22 could open the door to a short-term recovery, while a clear break below $0.20 would shift focus back to deeper downside risk. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.3610 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly, neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is PI’s price down today? Pi (PI) is slightly down today as it continues to cool off after a sharp speculative spike and crash earlier in the week, with the price now drifting in a tight range around $0.21 rather than seeing aggressive new buying. In a risk-off market where capital is favoring Bitcoin and sentiment toward altcoins remains cautious, mixed confidence in Pi’s fundamentals and thin liquidity are enough to keep short-term pressure on the price despite the lack of a major sell-off. Will Pi Price Reach $5? At the current pace of development and given its total PI supply circulating supply of over 8 billion PI, Pi Network’s value is unlikely to reach $5 in the near term. Multiple technical quantitative indicators and fundamental factors, such as delayed mainnet launch and maximum supply constraints, suggest that Pi’s price may fluctuate within lower ranges before any major uptrend. A $5 target would require sustained adoption, significant on-chain activity, and strong market demand that is not yet present. Will Pi Reach $10? Reaching $10 would represent a massive increase in Pi’s market cap, something that is not expected soon under current crypto market conditions. Analysts suggest that even optimistic forecasts place this milestone more than a decade away, if at all. Investors should treat such projections as speculative investment advice and conduct their own research before making investment decisions, as Pi remains a high-risk asset with uncertain long-term value. Recent Pi News/Opinions Pi Network is set to unlock 190 million PI tokens in December 2025, a move that will significantly increase the circulating supply and could add short-term selling pressure. It is expected liquidity to shift as more tokens hit exchanges, with traders weighing the risk of near-term price dips against Pi’s longer-term push toward real-world utility December's ~190M PI token unlock is not just about supply; it's a measure of our ecosystem's maturity.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi showed a sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72. At the start of July 2025, Pi Network faced high volatility as massive token unlocks triggered strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range. On July 19, 2025, PIUSDT declined slightly to $0.4412, reflecting short-term bearish pressure. On July 26, 2025, PIUSDT continued to hover under pressure around $0.4409, staying within a tight trading range as momentum remained subdued. for August 2, 2025. Pi traded at $0.3496, still under pressure and at its all-time low. On August 6, 2025, Pi Network is traded at around $0.3410, showing moderate consolidation with weak momentum and limited price movement. On August 9th, Pi/USDT went up from its early August low of $0.3766 and traded around $0.4103. August 17th, 2025, the Pi Network (PI) traded at $0.387 , showing slight movement between support at $0.383 and resistance at $0.390 . On August 21, Pi Network (PI) traded near $0.366, showing a modest 1.39% gain as buyers attempted a short-term recovery. On September 2, 2025, Pi network traded around $0.34, just above its past month’s August all-time low of $0.3304. On September 22, 2025, Pi crashed to a new all-time low (ATL) of $0.2234, marking a –92% drop from its February ATH and reflecting heavy sell-side pressure from token unlocks and weak demand. Pi rebounded slightly, to trade between $0.25 and $0.28 through late September, though resistance at $0.30 continued to hold firmly. At the start of October 2025, Pi trades at $0.2718, but is still struggling under bearish sentiment as buyers attempt to defend support above $0.26 while momentum indicators suggest only a weak recovery. On October 11, 2025, Pi Network hit a new all-time low of $0.1585, reflecting the peak of a prolonged market crash and severe selling pressure. On October 15, 2025, Pi Network (PI) stabilized slightly, trading around $0.1884, as short-term buyers stepped in following the sharp October 11 crash. On October 28, 2025, PI attempted a short rebound toward $0.238, but failed to hold gains, slipping back below the 20-day moving average. As of the start of November 2025, Pi Network traded at approximately $0.247, still below key resistance at $0.26, as traders remain cautious ahead of the upcoming 120 million token unlock expected in November. As of November 15, Pi network traded at $0.223. This rise for 1 day was driven by technical breakout signals, whale accumulation, and ongoing ecosystem updates. As of November 30, 2025, Pi Network traded around $0.243, consolidating above the $0.24 support zone while still below the $0.26 resistance heading into month-end. As of December 1, 2025, Pi Network had dropped to about $0.226, as sellers reacted to December’s 190M PI token unlock overhang and a broader risk-off mood in the crypto market. As of December 16, 2025, Pi Network traded around $0.196, having broken below the psychological $0.20 support as ongoing token unlocks, legal uncertainty, and sustained bearish technical momentum kept strong downside pressure on the price.",Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|TRADING|ZRX|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-27 11:00:00
56446831,649021,1766833209,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56446831.jpeg,Bitcoin News: Here’s How Much Was Liquidated In The Crypto Market In 2025,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-news-and-liquidation/,"CoinGlass has drawn the crypto community’s attention to how much was liquidated from the Bitcoin and crypto market this year. The October 10 crash notably stands out as the largest liquidation event in the market’s history. Here’s How Much Was Liquidated From The Bitcoin and Crypto Market In 2025 A CoinGlass report revealed that the total nominal value of forced liquidations across both long and short positions was approximately $150 billion. This corresponds to a daily average of roughly between $400 and $500 million in routine leverage washing. CoinGlass noted that the vast majority of trading days were limited to liquidations, which were in the range of tens to hundreds of millions of dollars. As such, these movements had a limited impact on medium to long-term Bitcoin prices and crypto market structure. However, CoinGlass stated that the systemic stress was fully concentrated within a few extreme event windows, with the deleveraging event of October 10 being the most obvious for the Bitcoin and crypto market . On that day, the market-wide liquidation volume reached an extreme peak, with short and long liquidations surpassing $19 billion. This marked the largest liquidation event in the Bitcoin and crypto market’s history and surpassed the single-day highs of all previous liquidation rounds. CoinGlass suggested that the magnitude of the October 10 liquidation may be much higher than $19 billion, given the disclosure timing of certain platforms and feedback from market makers. Based on this, the derivatives analysis platform estimates that the actual nominal liquidation scale likely reached between $30 and $40 billion. This figure represents a multiple of the second-highest liquidation event in the previous cycle, which occurred on April 18, 2021. CoinGlass noted that, structurally, the liquidations on that day were heavily skewed toward the long side, with long liquidations accounting for as much as 90% of total Bitcoin and crypto market liquidations. The platform stated that this indicates that prior to the event, BTC and related derivatives markets were in a state of extremely crowded long leverage. What Was Responsible For The October 10 Crash CoinGlass noted that from a casual perspective, the trigger for the October 10 Bitcoin and crypto market crash was Trump’s announcement of 100% tariffs on Chinese goods. This is said to have significantly elevated market expectations for another round of trade tensions between the two countries, prompting investors to shift to a “risk-off” mode. However, beyond Trump’s announcement, CoinGlass stated that long leverage utilization in the derivatives market was elevated and that the basis between spot and futures was high. As such, the entire Bitcoin and crypto market was effectively in a fragile state characterized by “high valuation plus high leverage.” Therefore, the derivatives analysis platform suggested that Trump’s announcement was just a catalyst that brought the ‘House of Cards’ falling. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $87,400, down almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Coinglass|Coinmarketcap,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-27 11:00:09

On-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant noted that this development could be bullish for XRP as it looks to rebound to new highs. XRP’s Open Interest Drops To Lowest Level Since 2024 In a blog post, CryptoQuant analyst Arab Chain revealed that XRP’s open interest on Binance has fallen to its lowest level since 2024. The analyst noted that analysis of XRP Ledger data on the crypto exchange shows a clear rebalancing in the derivatives market, with open interest falling to almost $453 million, the lowest level since the end of last year. Related Reading: Why You Should Pay Attention To XRP’s Exchange Netflows This Month Arab Chain noted that this development reflects a fundamental shift in trader behavior and confirms a significant decrease in leverage usage compared to previous periods. Notably, the XRP price looks to have been fueled by leverage in the early parts of this year. The analyst noted that open interest in XRP futures contracts exceeded $1 billion on several occasions, which coincided with strong price surges. The XRP open interest also rose again in mid-2025 to levels similar to those recorded in the early months of the year, sparking significant volatility for XRP. However, Arab Chain noted that the current landscape is “markedly different.” Open interest has declined gradually and then sharply, indicating a significant exit by short-term speculators. Meanwhile, the analyst explained that the decrease in XRP open interest carries dual implications. The first is that the decline in risk appetite and weakening momentum in the derivatives market explain the volatile price behavior in the absence of strong, liquidity-driven breakouts. The second is that the contraction represents a healthy structural development, as it reduces the risk of forced liquidations and mitigates the abnormal pressures associated with excessive leverage. Arab Chain noted that periods of low open interest often represent transitional phases, during which the market shifts froma highly speculative environment to a calmer one that relies heavily on genuine spot demand. XRP May Be Preparing For Another Significant Rally Crypto analysts have suggested that XRP may be preparing for another significant rally, although it remains to be seen if it could rally 600% like last year. In an X post, crypto analyst Niels stated that the altcoin is forming a higher low around this level. He noted that this is a similar structure that happened in April this year, before a new all-time high (ATH). The analyst added that a push above $2 could put the bulls in control.

In a recent briefing, he noted that current volatility does not signify weakness and anticipates a significant shift in 2026 that could benefit long-term investors. Rector noted that short-term fluctuations may continue as the market completes this phase, but he views the broader setup as constructive. At the time of his commentary, XRP was valued at approximately $1.87, representing a slight increase from the previous 24 hours. Market Strain Ahead of Record Options Expiry A key part of Rector’s assessment is the upcoming Bitcoin options expiration, valued at over $23 billion in notional contracts. He explained that events of this size often restrict price movement, as market participants aim to manage risk and extract value from both call and put positions. This has resulted in a narrow trading zone for Bitcoin and similar stagnation in altcoins, including XRP. Rector expects this compression to ease after expiry, which could allow cryptocurrency prices to move with less restraint. He thinks this calm period won’t last – it’s due to traders’ positions, not the asset’s actual value. XRP breakout incoming! Have orders set if they sweep liquidity to the downside and prepare for MASSIVE tailwinds in 2026! XRP vs Biggest Options Expiry EVER! https://t.co/T8NTuD9RsX — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) December 24, 2025 Liquidity Maps Point to Upside Bias Rector highlighted data from liquidity charts suggesting greater profit incentives in a move to the upside, with more short interest vulnerable at higher price levels. He said liquidity is building around $2.50, making it a likely target. XRP may dip to lower levels between $1.60 and $1.70 briefly before bouncing back. He cautioned traders not to dismiss a brief downward wick but maintained that any drop is likely to recover quickly if buying pressure aligns with liquidity conditions. Prolonged Range Trading Nearing Its Conclusion Since late November, XRP has traded within a tight band, which Rector believes is a strategic phase maintained by market makers. He asserted that this range-bound structure is not indicative of declining fundamentals. Instead, he considers a move above $2.50 a signal that momentum has shifted and that the previous floor may be confirmed. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 ETF Inflows Reinforce Long-Term Outlook Rector points to recent ETF performance as a key reason he’s bullish. The United States ETF market recorded $1.4 trillion in net inflows in 2025, alongside a total yearly trading volume of $57.9 trillion. XRP-specific products performed notably well within this environment. Canary Capital’s spot XRP ETF posted record opening-day volume , and the asset class has maintained inflows even during periods where Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs saw withdrawals. He interpreted this as a sign that institutional demand is building and could support a valuation re-rating in the future. Rector suggested that XRP is being accumulated at levels he considers lower than its fundamental potential. More institutional investors, ETFs, and liquidity could make 2026 a big year for XRP’s price. The analyst is watching key levels: support at $1.60-$1.70 and resistance at $2.50. He believes movement beyond these boundaries will determine the next market phase. Although volatility is expected in the near term, Rector maintains that the consolidation phase is maturing and that a larger directional movement may be developing.

56447788,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=884848,1766833832,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56447788.jpeg,"Data centers pivot to aircraft turbines, generators to bypass grid connection delays",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/data-centers-jet-engines-diesel-generators/,"Companies building data centers are increasingly relying on jet engine-based turbines and fossil fuel generators to meet electricity demands, as bottlenecks in supply chains and lengthy grid connection processes push developers toward alternative power solutions. Producers of turbines derived from aircraft engines and diesel-powered generators say orders have jumped as data center operators look for ways to avoid waiting for traditional grid hookups and larger gas turbines to become available. “The incentives have never been greater for any sort of technology that can supply power,” according to Kasparas Spokas, who directs the electricity programme at the Clean Air Task Force. The scramble for on-site electricity comes as data centers encounter waiting periods stretching to seven years for grid connections, along with public resistance over how their energy consumption affects utility costs. Installing power equipment like jet engine turbines and generators directly at data center locations allows companies to run their artificial intelligence systems without needing immediate grid access. Major tech players secure jet engine power GE Vernova has agreed to provide data center operator Crusoe with turbines adapted from aircraft engines. These units are projected to generate close to 1 gigawatt of electricity for the Stargate data center in Texas, which will serve OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank. Ken Parks, who serves as chief financial officer at GE Vernova, informed investors in December that the firm was experiencing “growing demand” for its aircraft-derived and smaller gas units, which “serve as bridge power supporting data centre needs.” The company’s aircraft-based turbine orders increased by one-third during the first nine months of 2025 when measured against the same period in the prior year. ProEnergy has delivered over 1 gigawatt worth of 50-megawatt gas turbines that come directly from jet engine designs. Though the company increasingly manufactures components independently, it continues using CF6-80C2 engine cores, the same type found in Boeing 747 aircraft. “We can deliver more quickly than bigger original equipment manufacturers,” said Andrew Gilbert, a partner at Energy Capital Partners, which holds the majority stake in ProEnergy Holdings. “The ability to find a few hundred megawatts to get started with, and then grow over time is useful too.” Aviation startup Boom Supersonic, which counts Sam Altman among its backers, struck a deal to sell turbines to Crusoe that should deliver 1.2 gigawatts of power. These turbines are “virtually identical” to units designed for the company’s aircraft. Boom Supersonic plans to channel profits from power turbine sales into financing its jet manufacturing operations. “Three or four years ago I imagined we would do the airplane first and energy second,” chief executive Blake Scholl told the Financial Times. “But then I got a call from Sam Altman who said: ‘Please, please, please make us something.'” Diesel generator demand doubles Diesel and gas-powered generators are also seeing increased adoption. Cummins has delivered more than 39 gigawatts of power equipment to data centers and roughly doubled its production capacity this year. Though data centers traditionally keep generators as emergency backup systems, Paulette Carter, who leads data center operations at Cummins, notes they’re witnessing “growing interest in on-site primary power.” Energy Secretary Chris Wright has floated the idea of tapping existing backup generators to strengthen the electrical grid, telling Fox News in November: “We will take backup generators already at data centers or behind the back of a Walmart and bring those on when we need extra electricity production.” Higher costs for on-site power solutions On-site power costs appear higher than standard grid connections, since these arrangements lack the cost advantages that utilities gain from large-scale operations. BNP Paribas analysts calculated power prices at a behind-the-meter gas facility that Williams Company is constructing in Ohio for Meta at $175 per megawatt hour, roughly twice what industrial customers typically pay for electricity. The power rush may ease when major technology companies reduce their infrastructure spending. “We’re in a very strong market right now, but it won’t stay like that forever,” said Mark Axford of Axford Turbine Consultants.

Most larger-cap alts have mimicked BTC’s performance, with ETH sliding toward $2,900 again, while XRP has slipped to $1.85. BTC Stopped at $89.5K The primary cryptocurrency had a wild week before the Christmas holidays when it pumped and dumped on several occasions from around $85,000 to $90,000, only to mark a local low at $84,400 after the US CPI numbers for November were announced. It managed to recover some ground during the weekend at the time and even went on the offensive last Monday. It spiked past $90,400 for the first time in about a week, and this rally seemed sustainable at first. However, as it happened during the previous few such attempts, the bears resumed control almost immediately and drove the asset south hard to under $87,000. Christmas Eve and Day were quite uneventful, as expected, but bitcoin attempted another breakout on Friday. This time, it couldn’t even reach $90,000 before the bears rejected it. In less than an hour, the cryptocurrency plunged to $86,500. It has rebounded slightly and now sits above a grand higher, but it’s still 1.5% down on the day. Its market cap is below $1.750 trillion again, while its dominance over the altcoins remains calm at 57.5% on CG. BTCUSD Dec 27.

XRP is well below its $1.90 support after another 1.5% daily decline. DOGE has dropped the most from the larger-cap alts, followed by LINK. In contrast, XMR and HYPE have charted minor gains, while ZEC and RAIN have exploded by double digits. The former is up by over 13% and has risen above $500, while the latter stands close to $0.008 after a 10% daily pump.

The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1, 2025, following the conclusion of the presale. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market was back in the red following a brief uptick on Friday. Bitcoin (BTC) is down almost 2% and has slipped below $88,000, while Ethereum (ETH) is down 1.5% at $ 2,320. Husky Inu AI’s (HINU) Next Move Will Take It To $0.00024394 Husky Inu (HINU) is set for its next price increase during the pre-launch phase, which will see the value of the HINU token rise from $0.00024300 to $0.00024394. The regular increases in the value of the HINU token enable the project to continue fundraising while empowering its growing community and existing token holders. The primary goal of the pre-launch phase is to secure capital, fund platform improvements, undertake market initiatives, and support broader ecosystem expansion. The project’s official launch is on March 27, 2026. However, the team is open to moving the launch to an earlier or later date. The project team will conduct a series of review meetings to determine the project’s launch date. The first two review meetings were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025, while the third is scheduled for January 1, 2026. Fundraising Goal Husky Inu AI recently faced a substantial slowdown in funding as markets grappled with bearish sentiment and waning investor interest. As a result, the project’s fundraising slowed down to a crawl. Husky Inu has raised $907,395 so far despite having crossed the $900,000 milestone back in October. However, funding has picked up again in recent weeks, with the project hoping to meet its stated goal of $1.2 million before the official launch date. Crypto Market Back In The Red Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market is back in bearish territory, with major tokens, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP), registering notable losses over the past 24 hours. BTC briefly crossed $89,000 on Boxing Day but lost momentum and fell to a low of $86,708. However, the flagship cryptocurrency reclaimed $87,000 early on Saturday before moving to its current level of $87,516, down 1.50%. ETH failed to reclaim $3,000 on Boxing Day, losing momentum after reaching an intraday high of $2,981. As a result, the altcoin fell to a low of $2903 before moving to its current level of $2,932, down nearly 1%. XRP is down 1% at $1.84, while Solana (SOL) is marginally up, trading around $123. Dogecoin (DOGE) is down nearly 3% and Cardano (ADA) is marginally down at $0.352. Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), and Litecoin (LTC) also registered notable declines over the past 24 hours. However, Toncoin (TON) and Polkadot (DOT) defied the bearish trend, rising by over 3% and 2%, respectively.

The noted analyst revealed through social media platform X that Bitcoin currently demonstrates substantial deviation from its traditional correlations with both the S&P 500 and gold markets. This development occurs amidst evolving global financial conditions and increasing institutional cryptocurrency adoption. Market observers now scrutinize whether this technical pattern will repeat historical performance or represent a new market paradigm. Understanding Bitcoin’s Historical Market Correlations Bitcoin has maintained complex relationships with traditional financial assets throughout its existence. The cryptocurrency frequently demonstrated correlation with major stock indices during specific market cycles. Similarly, Bitcoin occasionally moved in tandem with gold during periods of economic uncertainty. These relationships evolved significantly since Bitcoin’s inception in 2009. The digital asset initially traded independently before developing measurable correlations with established markets. Financial researchers documented several correlation phases between Bitcoin and traditional assets. A 2018 study published in the Journal of Digital Banking identified three distinct correlation periods. The research revealed increasing correlation during market stress events. However, Bitcoin maintained unique characteristics distinguishing it from both equities and precious metals. The cryptocurrency’s fixed supply and decentralized nature created fundamental differences from traditional stores of value. Bitcoin Correlation History with Traditional Assets Time Period S&P 500 Correlation Gold Correlation Market Conditions 2010-2013 Minimal Minimal Early adoption phase 2014-2017 Moderate Low Growing institutional interest 2018-2020 High during crises Increasing Macroeconomic uncertainty 2021-2023 Variable Inverse at times Post-pandemic recovery PlanB’s Analysis of Current Decoupling Patterns PlanB, renowned for his stock-to-flow Bitcoin valuation model, identified the current decoupling through quantitative analysis. The analyst compared current correlation coefficients with historical data. He specifically noted similarities to patterns observed when Bitcoin traded below $1,000. During that earlier period, Bitcoin demonstrated independence from traditional markets before experiencing substantial appreciation. The subsequent price movement exceeded ten times its value within a defined timeframe. The analyst employed several methodological approaches in his analysis. These included: Correlation coefficient calculations between Bitcoin and major indices Historical pattern recognition across multiple market cycles Statistical significance testing for observed deviations Comparative analysis with previous decoupling events PlanB emphasized caution in his assessment despite identifying the pattern. He explicitly noted that correlations can break unpredictably. The analyst refrained from guaranteeing similar outcomes to previous instances. His analysis concluded that market developments would clarify the situation over time. This measured approach reflects responsible financial analysis standards. Expert Perspectives on Market Decoupling Financial analysts offer diverse interpretations of Bitcoin’s current market behavior. Dr. Sarah Chen, cryptocurrency researcher at Stanford University, explains that decoupling events often signal maturation. “When assets develop independent price discovery mechanisms, they typically demonstrate reduced correlation,” Chen states. “Bitcoin’s evolving market structure suggests increasing sophistication among participants.” Meanwhile, institutional investors monitor these developments closely. Michael Rodriguez, portfolio manager at Global Digital Assets Fund, notes practical implications. “Reduced correlation enhances portfolio diversification benefits,” Rodriguez explains. “However, investors must distinguish between temporary deviations and structural changes.” These expert insights provide context for understanding current market dynamics. Historical Precedents and Market Implications The previous decoupling event referenced by PlanB occurred during Bitcoin’s early development phase. In 2015-2016, Bitcoin demonstrated reduced correlation with traditional markets. This period preceded the cryptocurrency’s remarkable ascent from under $1,000 to nearly $20,000. Multiple factors contributed to that historical price movement. These included increasing mainstream awareness, technological developments, and evolving regulatory frameworks. Current market conditions differ substantially from previous cycles. The cryptocurrency ecosystem now includes: Institutional investment vehicles like Bitcoin ETFs Advanced derivatives markets with substantial liquidity Global regulatory frameworks in development Integration with traditional finance infrastructure These structural differences complicate direct historical comparisons. Market analysts therefore exercise caution when projecting previous patterns onto current conditions. The global financial landscape has transformed significantly since Bitcoin’s earlier decoupling events. Interest rate environments, geopolitical factors, and technological adoption rates all present unique contemporary challenges. Technical Analysis and Market Structure Considerations Quantitative analysts examine multiple dimensions of Bitcoin’s current market behavior. Correlation measurements represent just one aspect of comprehensive market analysis. Other crucial factors include trading volume patterns, liquidity distribution, and volatility characteristics. These elements collectively determine market structure and potential price trajectories. Recent data from cryptocurrency exchanges reveals interesting developments. Bitcoin’s trading volume distribution shows increasing diversification across global markets. Asian trading sessions demonstrate growing influence relative to traditional Western market hours. This geographical diversification potentially contributes to reduced correlation with specific regional indices. The globalization of cryptocurrency markets represents an ongoing structural evolution. Regulatory Developments and Market Impact Evolving regulatory frameworks significantly influence cryptocurrency market dynamics. Recent developments in major jurisdictions create complex interactions with traditional financial systems. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission approved Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in early 2024. European Union markets implemented comprehensive cryptocurrency regulations through MiCA legislation. These developments potentially affect correlation patterns between cryptocurrencies and traditional assets. Regulatory clarity typically reduces uncertainty premiums in asset pricing. As cryptocurrency markets mature within defined regulatory parameters, their behavior may increasingly resemble traditional assets. Alternatively, unique regulatory approaches might preserve distinctive market characteristics. This tension between integration and differentiation creates ongoing uncertainty in correlation analysis. Macroeconomic Context and Global Financial Conditions Current macroeconomic conditions provide essential context for understanding Bitcoin’s market behavior. Global central banks navigate complex inflation management challenges. Geopolitical tensions affect traditional market correlations across asset classes. Currency fluctuations and commodity price movements create interconnected financial system effects. Bitcoin’s response to these macroeconomic factors demonstrates evolving characteristics. The cryptocurrency initially gained attention as potential “digital gold” during currency devaluation concerns. More recently, Bitcoin demonstrated characteristics resembling risk assets during specific market conditions. This behavioral complexity challenges simple categorization and correlation analysis. Financial researchers continue developing sophisticated models to understand these dynamics. Conclusion PlanB’s identification of Bitcoin decoupling from traditional markets represents a significant analytical observation with historical precedent. The pattern similarity to previous cycles preceding substantial price movements warrants careful attention from market participants. However, fundamental differences between current and historical market conditions necessitate cautious interpretation. Bitcoin’s evolving role within global financial systems continues developing through complex interactions between technological innovation, regulatory frameworks, and macroeconomic forces. Market observers will monitor correlation patterns closely as cryptocurrency markets mature through 2025 and beyond. The ultimate implications of current decoupling trends will reveal themselves through continued market evolution and price discovery mechanisms. FAQs Q1: What does Bitcoin decoupling from traditional markets mean? Bitcoin decoupling refers to reduced statistical correlation between Bitcoin’s price movements and those of traditional assets like stocks or gold. This suggests Bitcoin is developing independent price discovery mechanisms rather than moving in tandem with established markets. Q2: How significant was the previous decoupling event PlanB referenced? The previous decoupling occurred when Bitcoin traded below $1,000 and preceded a price increase exceeding ten times its value. This historical pattern contributes to current analytical interest but doesn’t guarantee similar future outcomes given different market conditions. Q3: What factors could explain reduced correlation between Bitcoin and traditional assets? Multiple factors potentially contribute including unique cryptocurrency market dynamics, evolving regulatory environments, increasing institutional participation, technological developments, and changing global macroeconomic conditions affecting different asset classes variably. Q4: How do analysts measure correlation between different financial assets? Analysts typically use statistical correlation coefficients ranging from -1 to +1. Values near +1 indicate strong positive correlation, values near -1 show strong negative correlation, and values near zero suggest minimal relationship. These measurements require sufficient data periods for reliability. Q5: Should investors adjust strategies based on correlation changes? Investment decisions should consider multiple factors beyond correlation patterns. While reduced correlation potentially enhances portfolio diversification benefits, prudent investors evaluate fundamental factors, risk tolerance, time horizons, and comprehensive market analysis rather than single metrics.

The central bank also plans to test crypto payments through QR codes, despite a regulator recently declaring cryptocurrencies will not be accepted as a means of payment in the country. Kazakhstan’s central bank launches pilot crypto projects The monetary authority in Astana has approved the launch of three pilots in the crypto sector, Kazakh media unveiled, quoting its press service. Among them is a project to tokenize refined gold accumulated by the NBK, the business news outlet Kursiv reported on Friday. The regulatory body did not provide more details at this point, but in 2025, it became a major global buyer of the precious metal. As reported by Cryptopolitan in October, the Central Asian nation’s gold reserves increased by at least 32 tonnes since the beginning of the year. Kazakhstan’s central bank has the right of first refusal on all gold refined in the country and has been taking advantage of that privilege. The institution ranked among the largest gold investors more than once in the past months, acquiring 8 tonnes in August alone. Prices of gold have reached record highs this year and are currently hovering around $4,500 per troy ounce. NBK Governor Timur Suleimenov described it previously as an “excellent investment product that performs better than cryptocurrencies and other financial instruments.” However, his deputy, Berik Sholpankulov, said in November that the regulator may invest some of its gold and forex reserves in key cryptocurrencies. The country intends to build a $1 billion national crypto reserve, and the NBK has already earmarked $300 million for it. Kazakhstan to trial crypto payments via QR codes Another pilot project that got the nod at a meeting of the National Bank’s Board is going to focus on testing crypto payments using a QR code platform. The news of its approval comes right after an official statement indicating the authorities in Astana are not inclined to permit the spending of cryptocurrencies on goods and services. A day before the NBK press release, the head of the Agency for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market ( ARRFR ), Madina Abylkasymova, was quoted as stating that while Kazakhstan will allow its citizens to invest in crypto assets, their use for payments will be prohibited . She was most likely referring to direct crypto payments, while the QR code system may involve the conversion of the digital coins into fiat money before a purchase is made. Abylkasymova was discussing the upcoming adoption of the new law “On Banks and Banking Activities,” which will comprehensively regulate digital finance and cryptocurrencies in the country. The bill is currently under consideration in the Senate after passing the Majilis. All Kazakhstani banks are expected to implement a single interbank QR code for payments by the end of the first quarter of 2026, Kursiv reminded. The website also recalled that in October, crypto exchange Bybit’s local platform announced a pilot for crypto payments via QR codes, presenting a prototype of the system at a forum in Dubai. The decision for its launch must be made by the NBK, Mazurka Zeng, head of Bybit’s fiat and payments team, said at the time. “As soon as they make it, we are ready to provide users [of Bybit’s app] with the ability to make payments,” the executive added. Zeng also noted that clients of Bybit Kazakhstan will be able to use the solution when paying with the app in all markets where the crypto trading company operates. Astana to pilot tenge-pegged stablecoin The third project unveiled by the central bank is centered on the issuance and circulation of a stablecoin denominated in the national fiat currency, the Kazakhstani tenge (KZT). Its role will be to facilitate digital asset transactions in the nation’s economy, once they are properly legalized and regulated beyond the currently limited legal regime of the Astana International Financial Center (AIFC). In September, Kazakhstan announced the launch of a tenge-pegged stablecoin called Evo (KZTE), based on the Solana blockchain and issued through the Intebix crypto exchange with help from Mastercard, as reported by Cryptopolitan.

Dogecoin (DOGE), the first meme cryptocurrency, has shown higher volatility levels, falling below the essential level of $0.13, with top holders re-assessing their holdings. However, money is pouring into a promising project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in the spotlight as it has proved to be a reliable alternative for those in pursuit of more substance than mere hype. In light of the larger traders drifting away from the conventional assets, there is undoubtedly an opportunity for MUTM as the next big cryptocurrency in the quickly growing presale phase. Dogecoin Faces a Challenging Market Dogecoin’s market trend has become less transparent, and its value is below the significant level of 0.13 USD. Current spot market sales and rising futures market volume indicate higher market volatility and market uncertainty. After the election rally, the DOGE/USD market experienced problems related to spot market sales and unwilling buyers from substantial market holders. Moreover, the supply is unbounded with very limited intrinsic value in the market at the current level. Technological as well as intrinsic issues are forcing major investors to look for alternate investments. Mutuum Finance attracts Strategic Capital Unlike other coins that do not have any utility in decentralized finance, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) seems to have taken a path that may pay off in the future because the project not only launched a presale event but has already raised more than $19.5 million with 18,580 new holders. Now is a great time to accumulate the best crypto to invest in today. The price per token is at $0.035, an increase of 250% from the previous price, although this level is 99% completed. As Phase 6 ends, Phase 7 begins with an increase in price to $0.040, providing another chance to buy the token prior to the launch price set at $0.06. More than a mere digital currency, MUTM holds potential for true growth within its roadmap. The design of the project facilitates the smooth execution of the project. Mutuum Finance has a sustainable dual-market lending system that combines contracted Peer-to-Contract access with tailored Peer-to-Peer loans. However, the issue of safety has also been addressed extensively, with Halborn Security performing audits of core smart contracts before mainnet launch. Additionally, to encourage community members to engage in the project, a leaderboard has been incorporated with a daily reward of a $500 MUTM bonus for the top community participant. In addition, access to MUTM tokens has been made easier, with purchases possible directly with a credit/debit card without any limit. The moves taken by experienced capital participants deserve special consideration, given that the capital invested will end up facilitating a project with exemplary execution and a robust economic background. This requirement has been met by Mutuum Finance with a strategy for the utilization of presale power in completing the journey towards becoming a fully launchable protocol, which responds to the need for a reliable source of yield and sustainable growth for the DeFi market. The quick execution of Phase 6 provides an opportune time for smart money participants to be part of this platform.

56448350,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=254597,1766835611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Crypto Predictions 2026: Pantera Capital’s Stunning Forecast for AI, Markets, and Money",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/pantera-capital-2026-crypto-predictions/,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Predictions 2026: Pantera Capital’s Stunning Forecast for AI, Markets, and Money In a detailed analysis that has captured the blockchain community’s attention, Jay Yu, a research analyst at the prominent crypto investment firm Pantera Capital, has laid out a comprehensive vision for the cryptocurrency landscape in 2026. Released via social media platform X, Yu’s twelve distinct predictions map a future where artificial intelligence, prediction markets, and stablecoins undergo transformative growth, fundamentally reshaping how users interact with digital assets and decentralized finance. This forecast, emerging from one of the industry’s most established investment voices, provides a crucial roadmap for developers, investors, and regulators navigating the next phase of blockchain evolution. Core Crypto Trends for 2026: Efficiency, Specialization, and Automation Jay Yu’s analysis identifies three primary vectors for growth in the coming years. First, he highlights the rise of capital-efficient on-chain credit . Currently, many DeFi lending protocols require over-collateralization, locking up substantial capital. Yu anticipates new financial primitives and layer-2 solutions will dramatically improve capital efficiency, enabling more sophisticated lending and borrowing mechanisms that rival traditional finance. This evolution could unlock trillions in currently idle digital asset value. Secondly, Yu predicts a bifurcation of prediction markets . These platforms, which allow users to bet on future events, will split into specialized segments. One segment will focus on high-stakes financial prediction markets , covering areas like corporate earnings, commodity prices, and election outcomes with deep liquidity. Another will cater to cultural prediction markets , centered around entertainment, sports, and social trends, potentially becoming a new form of social engagement and community building. The third core trend is the proliferation of agent commerce , referred to internally as ‘x402’. This concept envisions autonomous software agents, powered by AI and funded by crypto wallets, executing complex economic transactions on behalf of users. For instance, an agent could automatically rebalance a DeFi portfolio, negotiate the best price for a digital service, or manage a small business’s cash flow, all without direct human intervention after initial setup. The AI Interface Revolution and Real-World Asset Tokenization A particularly striking prediction positions artificial intelligence as the primary interface for crypto . Instead of navigating complex wallet addresses and smart contract interactions, users will increasingly converse with AI assistants. These assistants will execute trades, provide portfolio advice, explain transactions in plain language, and enhance security by identifying risks. This shift could make blockchain technology accessible to billions of non-technical users, acting as the ultimate abstraction layer. Concurrently, Yu forecasts the emergence of tokenized gold as a key real-world asset (RWA) . While tokenized U.S. Treasuries have gained traction, gold represents a universal, inflation-resistant store of value. Blockchain-based gold tokens, fully backed by physical bullion in audited vaults, could become a cornerstone of decentralized finance, offering a stable, yield-bearing asset for lending protocols and a hedge within crypto-native portfolios. This bridges the ancient value of gold with modern digital finance. Bitcoin’s Evolving Narrative and Corporate Consolidation The analysis also provides specific insights into Bitcoin’s trajectory. Yu expects discussions around quantum computing risks to Bitcoin’s cryptography to intensify significantly by 2026. As quantum technology advances, media and analyst focus will grow. However, Yu offers a calming perspective, noting the actual threat remains limited in the near term. The Bitcoin development community is already researching post-quantum cryptographic solutions, and any transition would be carefully coordinated, requiring broad consensus. Furthermore, Yu observes a trend toward corporate consolidation regarding Bitcoin treasuries. Following the lead of companies like MicroStrategy, many firms have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. The prediction suggests this space may consolidate around two or three dominant corporate holders , potentially through mergers, acquisitions, or the outsized growth of early adopters. This could create new, influential entities in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Another fascinating forecast is the continued blurring of lines between tokens and stocks . Security tokens representing equity, revenue-sharing DeFi tokens, and tokenized real estate will create hybrid assets. These assets offer the programmability and 24/7 trading of crypto with the cash-flow characteristics of traditional securities. Regulatory clarity, particularly in jurisdictions like the EU with its MiCA framework, will be a key driver for this convergence. Hyper-Liquid Trading and Stablecoin Infrastructure For decentralized exchanges (DEXs), Yu predicts a reorganization. Perpetual decentralized exchanges , which allow leveraged trading without expiry dates, will coalesce around hyper-liquid models . This likely involves deeper cross-chain liquidity pools, more efficient oracle networks for price feeds, and innovative mechanisms to reduce slippage for large trades. The goal is to achieve parity with, or even surpass, the liquidity found on centralized exchanges. Perhaps the most wide-reaching prediction concerns stablecoins. Yu envisions them expanding beyond a tool for crypto trading to become a genuine global payment infrastructure Conclusion Jay Yu’s twelve crypto predictions for 2026 paint a picture of a maturing industry moving beyond speculation toward utility, efficiency, and global integration. The intertwined rise of AI interfaces, specialized prediction markets, and robust stablecoin payment rails suggests a future where blockchain technology becomes seamlessly embedded in both digital and real-world economies. While forecasts inherently involve uncertainty, analysis from experienced firms like Pantera Capital provides a valuable framework for understanding the potent forces—technological, financial, and social—shaping the next chapter of cryptocurrency. The coming years will test these visions, but the direction points toward a more accessible, efficient, and interconnected financial system. FAQs Q1: What is Pantera Capital’s role in the cryptocurrency industry? Pantera Capital is one of the first and largest institutional investment firms focused exclusively on blockchain and digital assets. Founded in 2013, it manages venture capital, hedge funds, and early-stage token funds, making its analysts’ insights highly regarded within the sector. Q2: How could AI become the primary interface for crypto? AI could act as an intermediary that understands natural language commands. Instead of manually signing complex transactions, a user might say, “AI, swap 10% of my ETH for a top-yielding stablecoin on the safest available protocol.” The AI would then find the best route, explain the costs and risks, and execute the transaction upon confirmation. Q3: What are prediction markets in a crypto context? Crypto prediction markets are decentralized platforms where users trade tokens whose value is tied to the outcome of future events. For example, a token might be worth $1 if a certain candidate wins an election and $0 if they lose. They harness the “wisdom of the crowd” for forecasting. Q4: Why is tokenized gold considered an important Real-World Asset (RWA)? Gold is a globally recognized, physical store of value uncorrelated to traditional financial markets. Tokenizing it on a blockchain makes it easily divisible, transferable, and usable as collateral in DeFi protocols, combining gold’s stability with crypto’s programmability and accessibility. Q5: Is quantum computing an immediate threat to Bitcoin? Most experts, including Jay Yu, agree it is not an immediate threat. Breaking Bitcoin’s current encryption (ECDSA) requires a powerful, fault-tolerant quantum computer that does not yet exist. The network would likely implement a post-quantum cryptographic upgrade long before such a machine becomes operational, safeguarding user funds.

The authorities said they carried out the crackdown on perpetrators of several unregulated trading schemes, arresting more than 34 suspects. The development comes as the country continues its shift towards a formal crypto regime amid moves to open the industry up to licensed global companies. The operation was led by the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), targeting a network accused of running a fraudulent crypto and foreign exchange investment platforms that targeted victims both locally and internationally. Pakistani authorities claimed that the group promoted their fraudulent schemes on social media, luring users with the promise of high returns. Law enforcement nabs crypto fraud network According to Pakistani authorities, victims were initially shown fabricated proof of profits to build confidence before being asked to pay additional fees under various pretexts. Once their victims commit larger sums, the perpetrators move to block their accounts and steal their funds. Proceeds were routed through several bank accounts before they were moved into digital assets and then moved across borders. The latest effort marks a major move by law enforcement as part of a broader effort to eliminate the type of unregulated, cross-border activity that has flourished in the absence of regulations in the crypto industry in Pakistan. The bust also comes as Islamabad rolls out a new licensing regime for virtual assets under its dedicated regulator, the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority ( PVARA ). The authority has been tasked with bringing crypto activities under formal supervision. PVARA has also been charged with focusing on licensing, anti-money laundering controls, and consumer protection. The enforcement action and the regulatory rollout point to a clear strategy. The authorities are moving aggressively to shut down illicit operators while creating a legal pathway for large, compliant firms to enter one of the most active crypto markets in the world. According to Bilal Bin Saqib, chairman of PVARA, the efforts of PVARA will provide support to the 40 million user base in the market. Pakistan continues to make moves in the crypto industry Aside from its regulatory push and enforcement against illicit actors, PVARA has issued No Objection Certificates (NOCs) to Binance and HTX. The certificates will allow both firms to kickstart their licensing processes. They are expected to register with the country’s Anti-Money Laundering system, which will prepare them for a full licensing application. “This phased approach allows us to begin providing AML-registered cross-border services to Pakistani users while we continue working closely with PVARA toward full authorization,” Binance said in a statement. According to a previous Cryptopolitan report , Pakistan also signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Binance. Under the terms of the agreement, the exchange is expected to provide guidance to the country as it prepares to explore tokenizing up to $2 billion in state-owned assets. Binance will provide expertise on blockchain-based distribution of treasury bills and commodity reserves, including gas, metals, and commodities. In addition, Pakistan recently announced plans to launch its first stablecoin as it continues to eye the launch of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). “We want to be at the forefront of this financial digital innovation that is happening. Why should we be at the tail-end of it when we have the muscle and the adoption?” Bilal Bin Saqib said.

The arrest follows months of investigation into a scheme that exposed customer information and triggered global law enforcement cooperation. Significantly, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong publicly acknowledged the role of Indian authorities, underscoring the growing cross-border response to crypto-related crime. The case centers on a breach that emerged earlier this year, when Coinbase disclosed that attackers had bribed overseas support staff. Those actions allowed unauthorized access to customer data, raising concerns about insider risk within global outsourcing operations. Arrest Signals Progress in Global Probe Indian authorities, led by the Hyderabad Police, detained the former agent after coordinating with Coinbase and other agencies. Besides strengthening the investigation, the arrest highlights India’s expanding role in policing crypto-linked offenses. Coinbase has worked closely with international partners, including U.S. prosecutors, to identify individuals involved in the scheme. Moreover, the company has emphasized that enforcement efforts will continue as investigators pursue additional suspects. The case reflects a broader shift toward faster information sharing between private firms and public agencies. Hence, the arrest may accelerate further legal actions tied to the breach. Scope and Impact of the Data Breach The incident traces back to early 2025, when Coinbase detected unusual activity within its support operations. However, hackers formally contacted the company in May, demanding a ransom after obtaining customer records. Those records included names, addresses, and email contacts, but excluded passwords and login credentials. Instead of paying the ransom, Coinbase launched an aggressive response strategy. Additionally, the company announced a substantial reward to encourage tips leading to the attackers. Internal estimates placed potential losses between $180 million and $400 million, reflecting customer remediation costs and operational disruption. Security Lessons and Regulatory Context The breach exposed vulnerabilities linked to third-party contractors and offshore support teams. Consequently, Coinbase has reviewed internal controls and expanded monitoring of employee access. The case also reinforces the risks facing exchanges operating at global scale, where insider threats can bypass traditional safeguards. Moreover, the arrest arrives as Coinbase reestablishes its presence in India after regulatory setbacks. The exchange has also challenged U.S. state regulators over jurisdictional authority in separate legal disputes. Together, these developments show a company navigating security, compliance, and expansion simultaneously.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MINING|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|SECURITY INCIDENTS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-27 12:00:42

As capital moves faster and markets grow increasingly interconnected, long-standing inefficiencies in cross-border payments, liquidity management, and settlement infrastructure are becoming harder to ignore. Against this backdrop, senior figures within traditional finance are beginning to speak more openly about a future where digital assets—not fiat currencies—form the backbone of global value exchange. This debate was recently brought into sharper focus by Versan Aljarrah, founder of Black Swan Capitalist, who highlighted remarks attributed to a top finance executive discussing the long-term evolution of money. According to Aljarrah, the executive suggested that crypto will eventually underpin a global reserve system, while also arguing that new financial technology would surpass Bitcoin by eliminating friction across the financial sector. Top finance executive says crypto will eventually become the global reserve currency and that new technology will surpass Bitcoin while eliminating friction in finance. The technology he’s referring to is XRP on RippleNet. pic.twitter.com/a5DZL6HBBT — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) December 27, 2025 Bitcoin’s Role, and Its Structural Limits Bitcoin remains the most recognized digital asset and is widely viewed by institutions as a store of value or digital gold . However, its design priorities were never centered on high-speed settlement or seamless integration with existing financial infrastructure. Network congestion, variable fees, and limited throughput have prompted many within institutional finance to question Bitcoin’s suitability as the foundational rail for global payments and liquidity flows. The executive referenced by Aljarrah reportedly acknowledged Bitcoin’s historical importance, but emphasized that the next phase of financial evolution would demand technologies optimized for efficiency, scalability, and interoperability—particularly in regulated environments. XRP and RippleNet as Financial Infrastructure Within that context, the technology being referenced was XRP, operating within RippleNet. Banks and payment providers already use Ripple’s network for fast, low-cost cross-border transfers. XRP serves as a neutral bridge asset , enabling liquidity between different fiat currencies without the need for pre-funded accounts. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This utility-driven model directly addresses longstanding pain points in correspondent banking, including trapped capital, slow settlement times, and high operational overhead. Unlike purely speculative blockchain concepts, RippleNet’s infrastructure is active in real-world payment corridors, lending weight to arguments centered on practical adoption rather than theoretical potential. The Reserve Currency Conversation No digital asset has been officially designated as a global reserve currency, and the executive’s remarks should be viewed as forward-looking rather than declarative. However, discussions around tokenized liquidity, blockchain settlement layers, and digitally native reserve mechanisms are increasingly present in institutional and policy circles. XRP’s design —focused on speed, cost efficiency, and interoperability—positions it squarely within that conversation. A Gradual, Structural Shift As Aljarrah’s analysis underscores, this is not about an overnight replacement of fiat systems, but a gradual restructuring of financial plumbing. The future reserve framework, if it emerges, is likely to prioritize technologies that reduce friction and enhance global liquidity—criteria that proponents argue XRP and RippleNet are already addressing today.

The city is moving toward adopting the OECD’s Crypto Asset Reporting Framework, or CARF , a global tax transparency regime that would require centralized crypto exchanges to collect and share transaction data with tax authorities. Crypto assets could fall under the same rigorous reporting system that already governs traditional offshore bank accounts. For Hong Kong authorities, CARF requires a delicate balance of enforcing tougher oversight without undermining its appeal as a digital asset industry hub. A crypto reality check “Crypto trading is no longer considered a fringe activity. It’s a permanent feature of global markets,” said Calix Liu, founder of Hong Kong-based crypto and tax consulting firm FinTax. “Once regulators accepted that reality, the lack of reporting rules from the early years became a serious problem.” Liu said the regulatory vacuum before 2018 paved the way for large sums of money to move without clear disclosure requirements. “The anonymous nature of crypto transactions made it easier for people to hide taxable income, which was also made easier by the lack of a reporting framework,” he said. The proposal comes as governments worldwide step up efforts to close tax gaps created by digital assets. More than 70 jurisdictions have committed to adopting CARF , with the OECD and G20 aiming to roll out global crypto reporting between 2027 and 2028. Crypto is booming in Hong Kong Hong Kong has been praised as one of the most crypto friendly cities in the world. The Crypto Friendly Cities Index awarded the city second place after Ljubljana, Slovenia in 2025. Meanwhile, the city’s blockchain application sector grew by a staggering 250% between 2022 and 2024. Over the same period, the number of digital asset and crypto firms in creased by almost 30%, according to industry data. Hong Kong’s international business appeal also puts pressure on authorities to modernize tax and reporting systems around decentralized finance. The OECD has warned that the rapid expansion of crypto trading has outpaced existing global tax reporting rules and risks eroding “recent gains in global tax transparency.” Hong Kong is holding a public consultation on CARF adoption until early 2026. But rules are outdated Hong Kong’s existing tax rules were never built with crypto in mind. It currently relies on the OECD’s Common Reporting Standard, or CRS, which struggles to trace digital assets, said Stefano Passarello, chief value officer at Monx Team, a tax accounting firm in Hong Kong. “The existing CRS was never designed for wallets, exchanges, or decentralized platforms, which has left blind spots where wealth could move without touching a reportable bank account,” said Passarello. It’s a system that has come under international scrutiny. During an OECD peer review, Hong Kong’s CRS penalties were criticized as being “relatively mild” and insufficiently proportionate to the scale of non-compliance. The penalty structure reduced incentives for banks to invest heavily in compliance. Passarello explained that a bank that failed to report a handful of overseas accounts would face the same penalties as one that failed to report thousands. Credibility at stake Noam Noked, associate professor of law at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the new tax rules are a matter of maintaining Hong Kong’s international reputation. “Hong Kong always aims to be fully compliant with international tax standards and anti-money laundering standards. It’s an international finance and trade center and it wants to make sure it isn’t at risk of being blacklisted by other countries or international organizations.” Passarello also believes that Hong Kong’s interest in CARF is closely tied to protecting its reputation with global standard setters. “Hong Kong is basically signing up to CARF to stay in the good books of the OECD and keep its image as a clean, serious financial centre,” Passarello said. “With licensed exchanges, ETFs and large volumes now part of the core market, ignoring tax transparency on crypto flows would be a bad look.” But mandatory registration would also mean more companies that previously sat in a gray area would need to conduct proper due diligence and set up exchange workflows. “Smaller businesses will feel the cost and administrative burden the most, from fixing old client data to building systems that were never designed for CRS or CARF,” said Passarello. According to Noked, CARF obligations may extend beyond traditional crypto exchanges to other crypto projects that facilitate altcoin transactions as part of their business. “These players will need to assess the implications for their business,” he said. “If exchange transactions form only one component of a broader crypto project, businesses need to consider whether they want to pursue that and whether to separate it from the project’s non‑exchange‑related activities.” Enforcement is the real test Some experts caution that CARF’s effectiveness depends less on design and more on how effectively it’s enforced. Noked warns that even robust reporting rules could simply push activity away from centralized exchanges and toward peer-to-peer systems like self-custodied wallets that are harder to monitor. CARF marks a shift from promoting innovation to proving enforcement credibility. Hong Kong’s crypto strategy is not simply whether it adopts CARF but how it tackles the trade off between competitiveness and compliance. Get seen where it counts.

This coordinated action, announced on March 21, 2025, immediately affects thousands of traders and raises critical questions about blockchain network integrity and exchange risk management protocols. Consequently, market participants now face frozen assets, while the broader industry scrutinizes the implications for investor protection. FLOW Suspension Details and Immediate Market Impact Upbit, Bithumb, and Coinone issued nearly identical statements regarding the FLOW suspension. They identified a potential security vulnerability requiring immediate investigation. Specifically, the exchanges halted all FLOW-related transaction services, although spot trading pairs remain active on their order books. This partial freeze allows users to trade FLOW against other cryptocurrencies but prevents any movement of tokens on or off the exchange platforms. Market data shows a swift reaction: the price of FLOW dipped approximately 7% across global markets following the announcement. However, trading volumes on the affected Korean exchanges plummeted by over 60% for FLOW pairs, indicating a sharp decline in market confidence. Meanwhile, other major global exchanges continue to process FLOW transactions normally, highlighting the localized nature of this security concern. The Flow Blockchain: Context and Previous Network Events To understand this event, one must examine the Flow blockchain itself. Developed by Dapper Labs, Flow is a proof-of-stake blockchain designed for scalability, particularly for NFTs and gaming applications. Major projects like NBA Top Shot and UFC Strike operate on its network. Historically, Flow has maintained a strong security record. However, in late 2023, the ecosystem faced a smart contract exploit in a third-party marketplace, not the core protocol. That incident resulted in a loss of roughly $500,000. The current exchange-led suspension appears unrelated to that past event but underscores the persistent vigilance required in decentralized ecosystems. Furthermore, exchanges often conduct these reviews proactively after receiving alerts from blockchain analytics firms or internal monitoring systems. South Korea’s Stringent Regulatory Environment This action exemplifies South Korea’s rigorous approach to cryptocurrency oversight. The nation’s Virtual Asset User Protection Act , fully enacted in 2024, mandates strict security and operational standards for exchanges. Under this law, platforms must implement real-time monitoring, maintain high reserve ratios, and report any suspicious activity to the Financial Services Commission (FSC) immediately. A coordinated suspension by the top three exchanges strongly suggests they are adhering to a regulatory guideline or responding to a formal advisory. For instance, in 2022, a similar multi-exchange suspension occurred for WEMIX tokens following a delisting decision by the Digital Asset Exchange Association (DAXA). This precedent shows that Korean exchanges frequently act in unison when perceived risks emerge. Deposit/Withdrawal Freeze: Transactions halted for security review; trading continues. Regulatory Compliance: Action aligns with South Korea’s strict Virtual Asset User Protection Act. Market Reaction: FLOW price dipped 7%; Korean exchange volume fell over 60%. Precedent: Follows pattern of coordinated exchange actions led by DAXA in South Korea. Expert Analysis on Exchange Security Protocols Security experts emphasize that such suspensions are a standard, albeit disruptive, risk management tool. “When an exchange detects anomalous network activity or receives a credible threat intelligence report, isolating the asset is the first line of defense,” explains Dr. Mina Choi, a cybersecurity researcher specializing in blockchain at Seoul National University. “This protects not only the exchange’s hot wallets but also prevents potentially compromised tokens from entering their system and affecting other users.” Dr. Choi further notes that the investigation will likely focus on several areas: the Flow core protocol’s consensus mechanism, known smart contracts on the network, and the integrity of the deposit address generation system used by the exchanges. The review timeframe typically depends on the complexity of the issue, with previous cases resolving within 48 hours to two weeks. Practical Implications for FLOW Holders and Traders For users on Upbit, Bithumb, and Coinone, the suspension creates immediate practical challenges. Holders cannot transfer FLOW tokens to private wallets for staking or to other exchanges, potentially missing out on yield opportunities or arbitrage. Traders engaging in cross-exchange strategies face interrupted workflows. The exchanges have advised users to monitor official announcements for restoration timelines. Crucially, funds remain secure in user accounts during the suspension. Historically, services resume fully once the security review concludes and any required node or wallet software updates are deployed. Users are cautioned against responding to phishing attempts that often surge during such events, with scammers posing as support staff offering “emergency withdrawal” services. Recent Major Exchange Suspensions in South Korea (2023-2025) Asset Exchanges Reason Cited Duration WEMIX Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit Circulation Misreporting Permanent Delisting QTUM (2024) Upbit Wallet System Upgrade ~36 hours FLOW (Current) Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone Security Issue Review Ongoing Conclusion The coordinated FLOW suspension by Upbit, Bithumb, and Coinone underscores the proactive and security-first posture of South Korea’s regulated cryptocurrency landscape. While disruptive in the short term, such actions aim to safeguard user assets and maintain systemic integrity. The event highlights the critical intersection of blockchain network health, exchange operational security, and evolving regulatory frameworks. The resolution of this FLOW suspension will be closely watched, offering further insights into risk management best practices for the global digital asset industry. FAQs Q1: Can I still trade FLOW on Upbit, Bithumb, or Coinone? A1: Yes, spot trading of FLOW against other cryptocurrencies like KRW or BTC continues on the exchanges’ order books. Only the deposit and withdrawal functions are temporarily suspended. Q2: Is my FLOW token balance safe on the exchange during the suspension? A2: According to exchange announcements, user balances remain secure and unaffected. The suspension is a preventive measure, not an indication of a breach of the exchange’s own wallets. Q3: What could be the specific security issue with FLOW? A3: Exchanges have not released details to prevent exploiting the vulnerability. Potential issues range from a concern with the Flow network’s node software to a flaw in how exchanges generate deposit addresses for the token. Q4: How long do such suspensions typically last? A4: Based on historical precedents in the Korean market, security reviews can last from a few days to two weeks. The duration depends on the complexity of the issue and the coordination required for a fix. Q5: Does this affect FLOW transactions on other global exchanges or decentralized platforms? A5: No, this suspension is specific to the three named South Korean exchanges. Transactions on other centralized exchanges (like Binance or Kraken) and decentralized platforms interacting directly with the Flow blockchain continue as normal.

Aside from its psychological validity, this key support also appears to hold technical importance. Hence, its strength could be tested before the market shows directional momentum. However, a recent analysis has surfaced that paints a grim picture for the flagship cryptocurrency’s future. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply Overhang: 6.6 Million BTC Bought Above Current Price Descending Triangle Forms Near $85,000 Support In a recent post made on QuickTake, CryptoOnchain reveals that there has been the appearance of a classic technical pattern, indicative of an asset’s bearish continuation intent. This pattern, which is present on the Bitcoin daily timeframe, is characterized by a sequence of lower swing highs, with price compressing against a horizontal support acting as the triangle’s base. Interestingly, a price level, known as the Point Of Control (POC) — wherein lies the highest traded volume — also sits near the $85,000 support. This further reinforces the significance of the price level. If this price level were to be breached decisively, the Bitcoin price could see a rapid downward movement, seeing as liquidation and capitulation events would likely follow. Notably, heightening downward pressure might be seen if very little or no demand comes into play to reassert bullish momentum. Related Reading: Ethereum’s 2026 Overhaul Aims To Cut Costs, Boost Speed, Limit Censorship Exchange Activity Drops To Multi-Year Lows CryptoOnchain supports his bearish hypothesis with another notable on-chain observation. The indicator here is the Bitcoin Exchange Withdrawing Transactions (7-day Moving Average) metric, which keeps tabs on the number of on-chain withdrawal transactions made from cryptocurrency exchanges over a period of seven days. The analyst highlights that the metric’s readings have fallen to levels around 5,000, the lowest seen since 2016, about nine years ago. Interestingly, this current level falls short of the readings put in during previous bear markets (in 2018, 2020, and 2022). Exchange withdrawal activity offers insight into investor conviction and accumulation behavior. Rising withdrawal activity signifies growing accumulation appetite and increasing confidence, as coins sent out of exchanges are usually kept in private wallets. On the flipside, this significant fall in exchange withdrawal activity points to a deep feeling of disinterest among Bitcoin investors, or a lack of conviction that is important for long-term holding. Aside from the evident lack of urgency to acquire coins into private wallets, the low readings from this metric reveal that investors are also not actively accumulating BTC. The analyst concludes that “the data suggests widespread skepticism or exhaustion, with real, non-speculative demand largely absent.” If the $85,000 support fails, the lack of interested buyers could cause Bitcoin’s price to fall rapidly. As of press time, Bitcoin holds a value of $87,410, with no real movement since the past 24 hours.

In a recent post, crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto directed attention to a three-month liquidation heatmap for XRP, indicating that leveraged positions remain heavily concentrated above the current trading range. Rather than focusing on short-term fluctuations, the analyst emphasized how this data reveals where pressure is building in the derivatives market, offering insight into where price reactions could become more intense. THE 3-MONTH #XRP HEATMAP SHOWS WHERE LEVERAGE IS CONCENTRATED — AND IT’S STILL ABOVE. pic.twitter.com/2NGNPBDx2e — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 25, 2025 What the Heatmap Reveals According to Steph Is Crypto, the heatmap illustrates zones where large amounts of leveraged positions would be forced to close if the price moves into those levels. The visual shared alongside the post shows brighter liquidity bands sitting higher than XRP’s present price, suggesting that a significant portion of traders are positioned for upside moves using leverage. This concentration indicates that, if the price begins to rise, it could quickly enter areas where liquidations accelerate activity. The analyst’s core message is that leverage has not been cleared from these upper levels. Despite recent price action, traders remain exposed above, leaving the market vulnerable to sharp reactions should XRP approach those zones . The implication is not a guaranteed move, but a warning that the structure of positions favors heightened volatility if the price climbs. Community Reaction Reflects Caution A response from another market observer, Cryptonidas, reinforced the cautious tone. According to their comment , leverage appears to be crowded higher up, while he prefers to remain in spot positions and observe how the chart develops. His remark reflects a broader sentiment among some traders who see elevated leverage as a risk factor rather than an opportunity, especially in uncertain conditions. This exchange highlights a divide between participants willing to chase momentum with borrowed exposure and those who wait for clearer confirmation from the price itself. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What This Could Mean for XRP Heavy leverage above the market can be in two ways. If XRP starts to move higher with sufficient volume, it could trigger a chain of liquidations that adds fuel to upward momentum, potentially resulting in a rapid advance. In such scenarios, forced closures of short or overextended positions can intensify buying pressure over a short period. At the same time, these zones can also behave as areas of resistance. Traders aware of liquidation clusters may take profits or open counter positions near those levels, which can slow or stall rallies. If momentum is weak, the price may fail to reach the clusters at all, leaving leveraged traders exposed while the market continues to consolidate or drift lower. Steph Is Crypto’s focus on the heatmap suggests that, for now, the risk remains skewed toward volatility rather than stability. With leverage still stacked above, XRP’s next meaningful move could be decisive in determining whether those positions unwind through a squeeze higher or gradually lose relevance as price moves elsewhere.

Amid plenty of caution across the crypto markets, bitcoin remains the world’s biggest digital asset – with a market capitalisation of $1.74 trillion, around 19.97 million in circulation, and a maximum of 21 million in existence. The market is on edge. The crypto fear & greed index is stuck in fear, and we’ve just seen a $99.9 million net outflow in recent ETF flow data, which only adds to short-term risk aversion. Price Structure Signals Compression, Not Collapse If we look at the 4-hour chart for Bitcoin, we see it’s been stuck in a descending channel for a while now, with higher and higher lows since the $94,600 peak and a steadily rising base at $82,500. This is a sign that the buyers and sellers are evenly matched at the moment. Candlestick patterns add to that view. We’ve been seeing a lot of spinning tops and short-bodied candles recently, with mixed-up wicks, which is a classic sign of uncertainty and volatility. Every time sellers have tried to push the price below $86,300, they’ve failed, while buyers have yet to reclaim $88,600 with any real conviction. The stalemate suggests that energy is building, with buyers and sellers waiting for the other to crack. Key technical levels to watch are: Resistance levels are at $88,600, followed by $90,500 and $92,500 Support levels are at $86,300, then $84,450 50- day EMA is near $87,800, and the 100- day EMA is near $88,400-$88,500 It’s worth noting that EMA compression in this area often leads to a big up or down move, rather than just a slow grind on. Bitcoin Price Forecast: Momentum Stays Neutral as Breakout Risk Builds Bitcoin price prediction seems slightly bullish Momentum indicators are confirming that this is a pause rather than a full-on crash. The RSI around 47-50 is neither overbought nor oversold, and more importantly, we’re not seeing any bearish divergences. The RSI has stabilised with price, suggesting this may be a period of consolidation rather than exhaustion. If we look at the Fibonacci levels, Bitcoin is still holding above 38.2% retracement, which keeps the overall structure neutral to constructive. Looking at this from a Fibonacci perspective, the setup looks like a contracting triangle within a descending channel – a pattern that historically resolves in a big up or down move. If a bullish scenario were to unfold with a decisive break above $88,600, it could be followed by a run-up to $90,500, then a test of $92,500 near the top of the channel. On the other hand, if support were to fail, then $86,300, then $83,800 are the levels to watch. Bitcoin Price Outlook: Patience Before the Next Leg Looking forward, the technical bias remains cautiously constructive as long as the price stays above $84,450. A confirmed break above $88,600 is a sign that the consolidation has done its job and could set the stage for a push back towards $92,500 and $94,600. Maxi Doge: The Meme Coin Built for Maximum Hype Maxi Doge is exploding in popularity as traders rush toward its high-energy meme identity and fast-growing presale. With over $4.36 million raised, it’s quickly becoming one of the standout meme tokens of the year.

America’s central banking system has made the divide between wealthy and struggling households bigger through its recent policy choices, and top officials say they don’t have an easy way to reverse this trend. During the health crisis, millions of people, particularly those with money, benefited from rock-bottom borrowing costs when the central bank made credit cheap to prop up the economy. Today, even though lending costs have climbed far above those crisis levels, roughly 20% of people who own homes still pay less than 3% on their home loans, Fannie Mae reports. These families not only spend less each month on housing but have also built up financial worth simply by holding property. At the same time, Wall Street is wrapping up another strong year of profits, driven by continued spending on artificial intelligence technology. This marks an impressive three-year stretch of market growth. People with smaller paychecks, who rarely buy stocks and typically rent rather than own homes, have seen none of these financial benefits over the last five years. Their earnings also grew more slowly than those of rich workers throughout 2025, based on information from the Atlanta branch of the central banking system. Rising costs have become a major worry for many people, polls and surveys show, especially those earning less. Politicians have also started paying attention to this issue, including President Donald Trump, though he brushed aside these worries in a recent speech. Central bank officials, who help guide the country’s economy, have admitted they cannot quickly fix what experts call the “K-shaped economy.” “When I’ve talked to retailers and CEOs who cater to the top third of the income distribution, everything’s great … it’s the lower half of the income distribution that is staring at this going, ‘What happened?'” Christopher Waller, a central bank governor , said on December 16 at the Yale CEO Summit. Other policymakers, including Chair Jerome Powell, have recognized this growing divide this year. “The best thing we can do is try to get the labor market back on its feet, get the economy kind of growing better, and hopefully the job security and wage gains start catching up,” Waller said. How money policy played a part While the central bank’s decisions contributed to the different outcomes between rich and poor Americans, this was never the intended result. In 2020, officials were right to drop rates nearly to zero to help an economy damaged by the pandemic. The institution, which Congress directs to aim for full employment and steady prices, faced business closures that were sending joblessness soaring. Rates stayed extremely low until March 2022, when officials started raising them sharply to fight rising prices. By that time, roughly a quarter of the nation’s approximately 85 million homeowners had secured very low mortgage rates, and only a small number have given up those low rates since. However, the central bank may have contributed to the K-shaped economy much earlier. “This is a phenomenon that really started in 2008, with the massive liquidity injections that the Fed did in response to the global financial crisis, which raised stock market values and housing values,” Oren Klachkin, a financial market economist at Nationwide told CNN. “Since then, we’ve seen this persistent gap between the haves and the have nots, which actually narrowed after the pandemic.” The poorest Americans saw their pay grow quickly from 2020 through 2023, Atlanta branch data shows, moving much faster than pay for the wealthiest workers. Back then, employers were rushing to hire from a small pool of available workers. That changed this year. In September, the 12-month moving average of middle pay growth for the bottom quarter of households was 3.7%, compared with 4.4% for top earners. “Those at the bottom don’t have housing values to help them. They don’t have the stock portfolios to help them. And it’s harder for them to tap into potential lines of credit,” Klachkin said. “They mostly depend on their wages to outpace inflation.” No quick fix available The central bank’s primary tool, its key rates, which affect borrowing costs throughout the economy, is well known as a crude instrument. This means it cannot assist particular groups when trying to strengthen or ease pressure on the job market, which officials are currently doing. The institution also doesn’t control long-term rates, which typically follow yields on longer Treasury notes. Over the past two years, the bank has dropped its benchmark lending rate by 1.75 points to keep the job market stable. Officials hope these cuts will lift everyone together. The best approach to fix the K-shaped economy may simply be preventing job market decline and hoping other factors boost employment and pay.

56453002,649050,1766840433,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56453002.jpeg,Bitcoin Mining Crash: Bitmain Slashes Hardware Costs To Stay Afloat,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-mining-crash-bitmain-slashes-hardware-costs-to-stay-afloat/,"Based on reports from industry outlets and internal pricing lists, Bitmain has sharply reduced the asking prices for several of its Bitcoin ASIC models, a move tied to falling mining revenue and bloated inventory. The cuts place some high-end units near wholesale break-even levels for operators paying standard power rates. Following the April 2024 halving , which cut the Bitcoin block reward to 3.125 BTC, mining companies are increasingly adopting renewable energy to lower operating costs. Normally, higher BTC prices help offset the reduced subsidy, but 2025 defied expectations: after peaking above $126,000 in October, Bitcoin’s price dropped sharply to $80,000 by November. S19e XP Hydro And Bundle Deals According to dealer price sheets, the S19e XP Hydro and the 3U S19 XP Hydro are being offered at roughly $3 per TH/s in some factory sales and promotions. The S19 XP+ Hydro units are hovering near $4 per TH/s, market figures note. Older and immersion-ready models such as the S21 Immersion and S21+ Hydro are listed at about $7 to $8 per TH/s in certain offers while some auction listings started with bids near $5.5 per TH/s for S19k Pro variants. Mining Margins Squeeze Operators Mining income per unit of hashpower has fallen to levels not seen in several years, according to market trackers. That decline has pushed many operators to reassess expansion plans and look for cheaper gear or lower hosting rates. Bitmain’s price moves appear geared toward shifting stock quickly rather than supporting margins. Some miners reported the price cuts were large enough to make previously unprofitable deployments look acceptable again — but only if power costs remain low and Bitcoin prices recover. Market Reaction And Secondary Sales Used-gear markets reacted fast. Some resellers cut prices further to match factory reductions, creating a cascade of lower bids and more machines changing hands. Auction formats and bulk sales surfaced in public listings, which analysts say is a sign manufacturers are trying to clear inventory without publishing deep discounts across all channels. Smaller operators voiced relief; larger operations said they were watching closely, weighing whether to buy new units or delay purchases. Competition And Industry Context Reports point to weak demand across the sector, not just at one maker. Competing brands have adjusted offers in response, and secondhand supply has swollen. The overall effect has been a faster replacement cycle for the most efficient miners and an accelerated scrapping or resale of older rigs. Hashprice metrics, which measure revenue per TH/s, are at multi-year lows, leaving less room for recovery unless Bitcoin’s price improves or electricity costs fall. Short-term, cheaper new rigs could ease cash pressure for some operators who can deploy at favorable power rates. Long-term, the market may see consolidation as undercapitalized miners exit.

Historically, periods of uncertainty have often laid the groundwork for explosive upside, particularly when regulatory clarity, institutional capital, and macro liquidity begin to converge. For many market watchers, 2026 is shaping up to be a defining year—and XRP is once again part of that conversation. Crypto commentator Austin Hilton recently shared his outlook in a video posted on X, where he explored how a bold Bitcoin forecast could translate into significant upside for XRP. Hilton referenced a well-known anonymous market participant who previously called Bitcoin’s cycle high with striking accuracy and is now projecting a substantially higher peak in the next cycle. Do you agree or not – with what I say will happen on 2026 with XRP? pic.twitter.com/cQCAQIF4ww — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) December 26, 2025 Bitcoin’s Dominance as the Market Engine Hilton grounded his analysis in Bitcoin’s role as the primary driver of the crypto market. “Bitcoin is 60% of the entire crypto market capitalization,” he said, emphasizing that it remains the brand and liquidity anchor for the industry. According to Hilton, any sustained breakout in Bitcoin would inevitably pull capital into Ethereum, XRP, and other major altcoins through momentum and investor psychology. While reaffirming that he holds both Bitcoin and XRP, Hilton stressed diversification, noting that Bitcoin’s trajectory continues to shape expectations for the entire asset class. What a $250,000 Bitcoin Could Mean for XRP Using the anonymous forecast as a working assumption, Hilton explored a scenario in which Bitcoin reaches $250,000 in 2026. “If Bitcoin goes to $250,000, what would happen with XRP?” he asked, before answering plainly: “Number one, it would go up dramatically.” Hilton suggested that, under such conditions, XRP reaching $20 is “not out of the realm of possibility,” adding that the $20 to $30 range could be achievable during a full-scale bull market. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He framed this as a function of market structure rather than hype, pointing to how capital historically rotates from Bitcoin into large-cap altcoins during periods of strong bullish momentum. Brand Awareness and Relative Performance Hilton also pointed to XRP’s growing visibility beyond crypto-native circles. “I have people all the time who are not into crypto… who come to me and say, ‘I heard about this XRP thing,’” he said, arguing that brand awareness is quietly expanding. He further noted that XRP has held up relatively well compared to many altcoins, declining far less during recent market drawdowns—a sign, in his view, of underlying resilience. Regulation, Institutions, and the 2026 Setup A central pillar of Hilton’s thesis is the evolving regulatory and institutional backdrop. He highlighted upcoming U.S. legislation and increasing openness from major financial institutions to offer crypto products. “That’s trillions and trillions of dollars locked up behind Fidelity and Schwab,” Hilton said, suggesting that institutional participation has already helped establish a market floor. Looking ahead, Hilton summed up his outlook simply: 2026 holds a lot more possibilities.” While he acknowledged uncertainty will remain, he believes the alignment of regulation, capital, and infrastructure could make it a pivotal year—particularly for XRP.

Volatility has cooled, volume is lighter, and the chart has slipped into a familiar waiting game. But under the surface, both the technical structure and the broader narrative suggest this is more about compression than capitulation. Despite a 0.9% daily dip, Solana remains firmly positioned as a top-10 crypto asset, with a market cap near $69bn and more than $2.4bn in daily turnover. That’s not the profile of a market in retreat. It’s the profile of one catching its breath. What changed this week wasn’t the price, but the conversation. Ondo’s Tweet Signals a Bigger Shift A post from Ondo Finance quietly reframed how many traders are thinking about on-chain liquidity. The claim was simple but powerful: a $500,000 Google stock trade executed onchain with just 0.03% slippage, effectively matching traditional Wall Street pricing. Wall Street execution, now onchain. “You can buy $500K of Google with 0.03% slippage. I compared it to TradFi pricing, and it was the same.” @Bankless highlights the deep liquidity and low fees of Ondo tokenized stocks & ETFs. pic.twitter.com/QzJc7gCBCN — Ondo Finance (@OndoFinance) December 26, 2025 That matters because it highlights where crypto infrastructure is heading. Tokenized stocks and ETFs are no longer theoretical experiments. They’re reaching execution quality that institutions actually care about. For networks like Solana, built for speed and low fees, that’s not just noise, it’s relevance. This doesn’t move SOL overnight, but it changes how investors think about what kind of demand could show up next. Solana Technical Analysis: Chart Looks Tired, Not Broken Technically, Solana price prediction is suggesting selling bias as SOL is still trading inside a descending channel on the 4-hour chart, with lower highs from the $145 peak and repeated tests of support near $117–$118. That support has held twice, which matters more than most people realize. Solana (SOL/USD) Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Recent candles are small, overlapping, and messy, classic indecision candles. Spinning tops, short wicks, no follow-through. Sellers aren’t pressing their advantage, and buyers aren’t panicking either. That’s usually what a market looks like before it decides, not after it’s done. Price is sitting just below the 50-EMA near $124 and the 100-EMA around $126–$127, keeping upside capped for now. RSI hovering near 49 reinforces the same message: neutral, balanced, waiting. Where This Likely Resolves If Solana breaks and holds above $125.50–$126.50, momentum could return quickly. From there, the chart opens toward $133, then a retest of the channel top near $139–$140. A failure would put $118 back in focus, with $112 as deeper support. Maxi Doge: The Meme Coin Built for Maximum Hype Maxi Doge is exploding in popularity as traders rush toward its high-energy meme identity and fast-growing presale. With over $4.36 million raised, it’s quickly becoming one of the standout meme tokens of the year. The project mixes bold branding with real engagement features, from ROI contests to nonstop community events, giving it more personality and momentum than typical dog coins. Its shredded, leverage-obsessed mascot has already turned Maxi Doge into a recognizable culture coin. Holders can also stake $MAXI for daily smart-contract rewards and unlock access to exclusive competitions and partner events. The staking utility adds a passive-earning layer that keeps users active and invested in the ecosystem. With $MAXI priced at $0.000275 and the next increase approaching, the presale continues to gain speed. If you’re looking for a meme coin built on hype, personality, and real community energy, Maxi Doge is shaping up to be one worth watching.

This comprehensive analysis examines DOGE’s historical patterns, current adoption metrics, and future market dynamics to provide evidence-based projections. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Understanding the $1 Question Dogecoin’s journey from meme to mainstream cryptocurrency represents one of digital finance’s most fascinating narratives. Originally created in December 2013 by Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer as a lighthearted alternative to Bitcoin, DOGE has evolved into a serious digital asset with a market capitalization that frequently ranks among the top fifteen cryptocurrencies globally. The coin’s inflationary supply model, which adds approximately 5 billion new DOGE annually through mining rewards, creates fundamentally different economic dynamics than Bitcoin’s deflationary approach. Market analysts consistently monitor several critical factors when projecting Dogecoin’s future value. Transaction volume across major exchanges provides insight into investor interest, while merchant adoption rates indicate real-world utility. Furthermore, development activity on the Dogecoin blockchain and integration with payment platforms like Tesla and AMC Theatres demonstrate growing institutional acceptance. These elements collectively form the foundation for any serious price prediction analysis. Historical Performance and Market Context Dogecoin’s price history reveals remarkable volatility alongside sustained growth periods. The cryptocurrency traded below $0.01 for most of its existence until 2021, when it surged to an all-time high of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021. This 15,000% increase within five months demonstrated DOGE’s capacity for explosive growth during favorable market conditions. However, the subsequent correction to approximately $0.05 by July 2021 highlighted the asset’s vulnerability to broader cryptocurrency market trends. Several key events have historically influenced Dogecoin’s valuation significantly. Elon Musk’s public endorsements on social media platforms consistently generated short-term price spikes, while integration with payment processors like BitPay expanded the coin’s utility. The 2021 collaboration with the SpaceX DOGE-1 mission to the moon symbolized Dogecoin’s cultural impact beyond financial markets. These developments established important precedents for understanding how future events might affect DOGE’s price trajectory toward the $1 threshold. Expert Analysis and Economic Fundamentals Financial institutions and cryptocurrency research firms approach Dogecoin predictions with varying methodologies. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike McGlone frequently emphasizes Dogecoin’s correlation with broader cryptocurrency trends, particularly Bitcoin’s performance. Meanwhile, blockchain analytics platform CoinMetrics focuses on on-chain data, including active address counts and transaction value. These analytical approaches provide complementary perspectives on DOGE’s potential path forward. The table below summarizes recent institutional predictions for Dogecoin’s price targets: Source 2026 Prediction 2028 Prediction 2030 Prediction WalletInvestor $0.18 – $0.35 $0.40 – $0.65 $0.70 – $0.95 DigitalCoinPrice $0.25 – $0.45 $0.55 – $0.80 $0.85 – $1.10 TradingBeasts $0.15 – $0.30 $0.35 – $0.60 $0.65 – $0.90 These projections consistently identify several crucial factors that could accelerate or hinder Dogecoin’s progress toward $1: Regulatory developments in major markets like the United States and European Union Technological upgrades to the Dogecoin network’s transaction speed and security Mainstream payment integration with additional retailers and service providers Broader cryptocurrency adoption driving overall market capitalization growth The Road to $1: Technical and Adoption Requirements Reaching a $1 valuation requires Dogecoin to achieve specific technical and adoption milestones. Currently trading with a circulating supply exceeding 132 billion coins, a $1 price would translate to a market capitalization surpassing $132 billion. This valuation would place DOGE among the world’s top financial assets, comparable to major corporations like Starbucks or Boeing. Achieving this position necessitates substantial growth in both user adoption and transaction volume. Several development initiatives could potentially accelerate Dogecoin’s progress. The Dogecoin Foundation has announced plans for network improvements, including enhanced security protocols and reduced transaction fees. Additionally, increased developer activity on GitHub suggests growing technical commitment to the project. These improvements might address current limitations and position DOGE more competitively against payment-focused cryptocurrencies like Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash. Comparative Analysis with Similar Cryptocurrencies Examining Dogecoin’s trajectory alongside comparable assets provides valuable context for price predictions. Litecoin, often called “digital silver” to Bitcoin’s “digital gold,” reached its all-time high of $412.96 in May 2021. This represented a market capitalization of approximately $28.8 billion at its peak. For Dogecoin to reach $1, it would need to achieve nearly five times Litecoin’s maximum historical valuation, highlighting the scale of required growth. Similarly, Ripple’s XRP token demonstrates how regulatory developments can dramatically affect cryptocurrency valuations. XRP’s ongoing legal proceedings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have created significant price volatility since December 2020. Dogecoin benefits from clearer regulatory positioning as a decentralized cryptocurrency, potentially reducing similar legal uncertainties. This regulatory clarity might provide DOGE with advantages in institutional adoption compared to tokens with unresolved legal status. Market Dynamics and External Influences Global economic conditions significantly influence all cryptocurrency valuations, including Dogecoin. During periods of monetary expansion and low interest rates, investors typically demonstrate increased appetite for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, tightening monetary policies often correlate with cryptocurrency market contractions. The Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions and inflation management strategies will likely impact DOGE’s price trajectory throughout the prediction period. Technological advancements in the broader blockchain ecosystem also affect Dogecoin’s competitive position. The emergence of layer-2 scaling solutions, improved wallet security, and enhanced privacy features across multiple blockchain networks raise user expectations for all cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin’s development community must maintain pace with these innovations to preserve the asset’s relevance. Failure to implement competitive technological improvements could limit DOGE’s growth potential regardless of favorable market conditions. Social media influence remains uniquely significant for Dogecoin compared to other major cryptocurrencies. Analysis of Twitter, Reddit, and TikTok engagement metrics reveals strong correlations between social media activity and DOGE price movements. This relationship creates both opportunities and vulnerabilities. While positive social sentiment can drive rapid price appreciation, it also increases susceptibility to coordinated manipulation or sudden sentiment shifts. Investors should consider this distinctive characteristic when evaluating Dogecoin’s risk profile. Conclusion Dogecoin’s path to a $1 valuation between 2026 and 2030 depends on multiple converging factors. Technological development, regulatory clarity, mainstream adoption, and favorable market conditions must align for DOGE to achieve this significant milestone. While historical performance demonstrates Dogecoin’s capacity for extraordinary growth, the scale required for a $1 valuation presents substantial challenges. Investors should monitor development progress, adoption metrics, and broader cryptocurrency trends when assessing Dogecoin’s long-term potential. This Dogecoin price prediction analysis provides a framework for understanding the realistic possibilities and requirements for reaching the psychologically important $1 threshold. FAQs Q1: What is the most realistic Dogecoin price prediction for 2026? Most analysts project Dogecoin trading between $0.15 and $0.45 in 2026, depending on broader cryptocurrency market conditions and DOGE-specific developments. Q2: Can Dogecoin realistically reach $1 by 2030? While possible, reaching $1 by 2030 requires substantial growth in adoption, technological improvements, and favorable market conditions exceeding current projections. Q3: What factors most influence Dogecoin’s price predictions? Key factors include Bitcoin’s performance, regulatory developments, merchant adoption rates, technological upgrades, and social media sentiment. Q4: How does Dogecoin’s inflationary supply affect price predictions? The annual 5 billion DOGE issuance creates consistent selling pressure from miners, potentially limiting price appreciation compared to deflationary cryptocurrencies. Q5: What would Dogecoin’s market capitalization be at $1? With approximately 132 billion circulating coins, a $1 Dogecoin price would equal a market capitalization exceeding $132 billion.

Rather than focusing on market sentiment, his remarks centered on design choices and practical limitations that could shape how these networks are used in real-world financial environments. Let's talk about $BTC Lightning Network vs the $XRP Ledger pic.twitter.com/H8SVf1hgpU — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) December 26, 2025 How the Lightning Network Functions Claver described the Lightning Network as a second-layer solution built on top of Bitcoin. In his view, it operates by locking Bitcoin on the base layer and allowing users to exchange value within off-chain channels, with final settlement occurring when those funds are released back to the main network. This structure enables faster transactions compared to Bitcoin’s base layer, but he argued that it remains constrained by the underlying design of Bitcoin itself. According to Claver, even with Lightning, throughput remains far below the levels required for large-scale payment systems. He suggested that Bitcoin’s architecture was never intended to support the type of transaction volumes seen in global networks, such as major card processors. In his assessment, no secondary layer can fully overcome those limits if the base layer lacks the necessary functionality for high-speed, high-volume settlement. Scalability and Structure of the XRP Ledger Turning to the XRP Ledger , Claver pointed to its on-ledger performance, noting that its transaction capacity is already far higher than Bitcoin’s base layer. He acknowledged that even this level may not be sufficient for the largest institutional use cases. However, he emphasized that the XRPL is designed to evolve through sidechains and subnet-style structures that can expand throughput while remaining interoperable with the main network. He framed this approach as fundamentally different from a temporary overlay, arguing that scaling solutions tied directly to the XRPL’s architecture allow for real settlement between counterparties . In his view, this makes the network more suitable for financial products that require certainty, speed, and direct finality. Limits of Bitcoin for Financial Applications Claver also addressed Bitcoin’s broader capabilities, stating that it lacks native support for issuing assets and more complex financial functions. While he acknowledged ongoing efforts to adapt Bitcoin for additional uses, he characterized these as workarounds built on a system not originally designed for such purposes. He contrasted this with the XRPL’s built-in features, including decentralized exchange functionality and tools that can support compliance, digital identity, and credential frameworks. From his perspective, Bitcoin’s evolution toward a store-of-value narrative reflects these constraints. He argued that decisions made early in its development, particularly around block size and network structure, shifted it away from the peer-to-peer payment vision originally outlined for the protocol.

He positioned the XRP Ledger , with its sidechain strategy and focus on native functionality, as better aligned with those requirements than Bitcoin and its layered extensions. Overall, his comparison presented two distinct philosophies: one centered on preserving a base layer with limited change while adding external solutions, and another focused on building scalability and functionality into the core framework to meet the demands of modern financial markets.

Trump had won the US elections, the cryptocurrency market was booming, and meme coins were popping left and right, charting fresh peaks. Although DOGE failed to match its 2021 run, it still challenged the $0.50 level in anticipation of the new government department with the same acronym run by Musk. Fast-forward to late 2025, and the landscape is entirely different. The OG meme coin has fallen into obscurity, with its price barely hanging above $0.12. It’s down 7% weekly and 20% monthly. What’s perhaps even more worrisome is the recent behavior of Dogecoin whales. According to data shared by Ali Martinez, these market participants have gone on a substantial selling spree in the past several days, disposing of 150 million coins. 150 million Dogecoin $DOGE sold by whales in the last five days. pic.twitter.com/XxN1FZWDv1 — Ali Charts (@alicharts) December 26, 2025 The largest meme coin also joined the likes of Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and SOL a month ago when it had a couple of exchange-traded funds tracking its performance go live on Wall Street. The products, launched by Grayscale and Bitwise, are called GDOG and BWOW. While this might sound like a step in the right direction, especially in terms of legitimacy, the actual numbers are disappointing, to say the least. Data from SoSoValue shows that there has been only minor activity for the past month. The total net inflows stand at just over $2 million, which is nothing in comparison to the $1.1 billion the XRP funds have attracted in a similar period. Moreover, no actual activity has been recorded since December 10. This only goes to prove that meme coins are hyped almost exclusively by retail, and when there’s no Elon Musk (or someone with similar stature) to promote them, they might be forgotten, at least for the moment. However, such negative periods have been seen in the past, but DOGE has always found a way to make its way back into people’s hearts.

56452485,https://cryptonews.com/?p=468170,1766842706,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/56452485.jpeg,XRP Price Prediction: Why $1.77 Support Is the Level Traders Can’t Ignore,https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-price-prediction-why-1-77-support-is-the-level-traders-cant-ignore/,"XRP is currently trading around $1.85, which tells us something important: this isn’t about getting caught up in hype or an attention-grabbing story anymore; it is about what’s really going on with the structure. The price action has slowed down since that pullback from $2.11, and now XRP is at a technical crossroads, with the next move potentially setting the tone for the next few weeks. Right now, XRP has a market capitalization of around $111.9 billion – putting it at number five out of all the cryptos – and with a daily trading volume of roughly $1.53 billion, that’s not panic selling so much as steady participation. We like that kind of stability – especially when XRP is having to navigate a tightening technical range. XRP Price Prediction: Descending Channel Keeps XRP Contained Looking at the 4-hour chart, XRP price prediction seems bearish as XRP is still stuck inside a descending channel, which has had a series of lower highs since that $2.11 peak, and no matter how hard it tries, each recovery has been pushed back down by falling trend resistance. Meanwhile, the 50-EMA sits at just over $1.88 and the 100-EMA at $1.92. At the same time, the decline hasn’t been a wild, impulsive free-fall, suggesting it’s still possible to think in terms of distribution rather than a complete and utter collapse. You can see that the price is still below the 50-EMA near $1.88 and the 100-EMA around $1.92, which also reinforces some caution for the short term. But – and this is a big but – sellers have so far failed to force a sustained breakdown, which suggests that the downward pressure is starting to ease off a bit rather than intensify. Candlesticks and RSI Signal Compression Looking at the candles, you can see that we’re mostly seeing small bodies, with spinning tops and doji-like formations – and that says a lot about the hesitation we’re seeing right now. No one – at least, not yet – has really got a clear upper hand. XRP Price Chart – Source: Tradingview With the RSI hovering around the low 40s, you can see that we’re not really seeing any sharp upward or downward momentum – it’s just sort of steady. And it’s also worth noting that – and this is a big positive – we’re not seeing any bearish divergence, which actually reduces the chances of a sharp, sudden plunge lower. Instead, XRP is just compressing near the support level. Key Levels That Define the Next Move So, to summarize where we are now, the technical roadmap is fairly clear: The big resistance zone is currently at $1.88–$1.92 If we can break through above $1.92 then we’ve got the green light to head upwards – and the targets would be $1.96, then $2.05–$2.10. Support is down at $1.77 Downside risk kicks in if that support starts to fail and we drop below $1.65 As long as that support at $1.77 holds, we’re still just in a consolidation phase – and not bearing the brunt of some kind of breakdown. If we can break through $1.92, that’s been shown to shift the momentum back towards the buyers – and that opens up the door for another run towards $2.05–$2.10. But until then, patiently waiting for what happens next is probably the smartest move.

This comprehensive analysis examines the Pepe memecoin’s realistic path through 2026-2030, grounded in market fundamentals and historical patterns rather than speculative hype. PEPE Price Prediction: Understanding the Current Landscape Market analysts observe PEPE’s position within the broader memecoin ecosystem. The token launched in April 2023 during a period of renewed memecoin enthusiasm. Since its inception, PEPE has demonstrated both volatility and resilience. Trading volumes frequently exceed $500 million daily during market surges. However, the token faces significant challenges including market saturation and regulatory scrutiny. Historical data reveals that memecoins typically follow boom-bust cycles. These patterns provide crucial context for future projections. Several key factors influence PEPE’s valuation trajectory. Market capitalization remains a primary consideration. Reaching 1 cent would require approximately a 200x increase from current levels. This represents a market cap exceeding $40 billion. For comparison, Dogecoin’s peak market cap reached $88 billion in 2021. The broader cryptocurrency market conditions significantly impact such ambitious targets. Bull markets historically amplify memecoin performance. Conversely, bear markets disproportionately affect speculative assets. Technical Analysis and Historical Precedents Technical indicators provide measurable insights into PEPE’s potential movement. The token’s price action shows correlation with Bitcoin’s performance. This relationship typically strengthens during market extremes. On-chain metrics reveal holder distribution patterns. Approximately 45% of tokens reside in top wallets. This concentration affects price stability during volatility periods. Trading volume patterns indicate retail investor dominance. This demographic tends toward higher emotional trading responses. Historical memecoin performance offers valuable comparative data. Successful projects typically demonstrate specific characteristics. These include strong community engagement and continuous development. Many also feature utility expansion beyond pure speculation. The 2021 memecoin surge created multiple billion-dollar projects. However, most experienced 90%+ corrections afterward. This volatility underscores the importance of risk management. Investors should consider these patterns when evaluating long-term projections. Expert Perspectives on Memecoin Valuation Financial analysts emphasize fundamental valuation challenges. Traditional metrics like discounted cash flow don’t apply directly. Instead, experts assess network effects and community strength. University researchers published findings in the Journal of Digital Finance. Their study analyzed 500 memecoins across three market cycles. Results showed only 2.3% maintained value over five years. The research highlighted community quality as the strongest predictor. Active development teams also correlated with better outcomes. Industry professionals provide additional context through market observations. Crypto fund managers note changing investor behavior. Institutional participation remains minimal in pure memecoins. However, some hedge funds allocate small percentages for diversification. Regulatory developments significantly impact market perceptions. The SEC’s classification decisions affect exchange listings and accessibility. These factors collectively influence price discovery mechanisms. They also affect liquidity during critical market movements. Market Dynamics and External Influences Macroeconomic conditions substantially affect cryptocurrency valuations. Interest rate decisions influence risk asset appetites. Inflation data correlates with crypto market movements. Geopolitical events frequently trigger volatility spikes. These external factors often overshadow project-specific developments. The 2024-2025 period shows particular sensitivity to monetary policy. Federal Reserve announcements consistently impact trading volumes. This relationship will likely continue through the prediction period. Technological developments create additional variables. Layer-2 solutions improve transaction efficiency. These advancements benefit high-volume tokens like PEPE. Exchange innovations increase accessibility for retail investors. New trading products provide additional exposure methods. However, technological risks also exist. Smart contract vulnerabilities have affected numerous projects. Security audits become increasingly important as values rise. The PEPE team’s commitment to technical excellence will influence investor confidence. The 1-Cent Target: Mathematical Realities Achieving 1 cent requires specific market conditions. Current circulating supply exceeds 420 trillion tokens. This creates inherent inflationary pressure on price appreciation. Tokenomics models suggest gradual supply reduction mechanisms. Some projects implement burning protocols to decrease circulating amounts. PEPE’s design includes deflationary characteristics. However, the magnitude remains insufficient for dramatic revaluation alone. Market demand must increase exponentially to offset supply dynamics. Comparative analysis provides perspective on the challenge. Bitcoin required approximately 12 years to reach similar percentage gains. Ethereum achieved comparable growth in 7 years. Memecoins historically demonstrate faster but less sustainable appreciation. The psychological barrier at 1 cent represents more than numerical significance. It serves as a milestone that could trigger additional interest. Breaking through round number resistance often accelerates momentum temporarily. Risk Factors and Alternative Scenarios Multiple risk factors could derail optimistic projections. Regulatory crackdowns represent the most significant threat. Several jurisdictions consider memecoin-specific regulations. These could restrict trading or impose additional requirements. Market saturation presents another challenge. Hundreds of new memecoins launch monthly. This fragmentation divides investor attention and capital. Technological obsolescence risks also exist. Blockchain innovations might favor newer token standards. Investors should consider probability-weighted scenarios. Bull case projections assume favorable market conditions. These include sustained crypto adoption growth and limited regulation. The base case incorporates moderate market expansion with periodic corrections. Bear scenarios account for extended downturns or regulatory interventions. Each scenario produces dramatically different outcomes. Responsible analysis presents all possibilities rather than单一 predictions. This approach aligns with financial best practices. Conclusion This PEPE price prediction analysis reveals the complex path toward 1 cent. The Pepe memecoin faces substantial challenges but operates within a dynamic market. Reaching the target requires exceptional circumstances through 2026-2030. Market capitalization requirements demand unprecedented growth. However, cryptocurrency history contains multiple surprising developments. Investors should balance optimism with rigorous risk assessment. The PEPE price prediction landscape remains fluid as new data emerges continuously. FAQs Q1: What is the probability of PEPE reaching 1 cent by 2030? Historical data suggests low probability, estimated below 5% based on comparable assets. The required market capitalization exceeds $40 billion, demanding exceptional circumstances. Q2: What factors most influence PEPE’s price movement? Bitcoin correlation, trading volume, community engagement, regulatory developments, and overall cryptocurrency market sentiment collectively drive price discovery. Q3: How does PEPE compare to other memecoins historically? PEPE demonstrates stronger than average community metrics but faces higher supply inflation than many competitors. Its performance aligns with mid-tier memecoins during similar lifecycle stages. Q4: What are the biggest risks for PEPE investors? Regulatory intervention, market saturation, technological vulnerabilities, and extreme volatility represent primary risks. Liquidity constraints during downturns also concern analysts. Q5: Should investors consider PEPE for long-term portfolios? Financial advisors typically recommend minimal allocation to speculative assets. Most suggest below 5% of cryptocurrency exposure, with thorough risk acknowledgment and continuous monitoring.

As blockchain technology continues its relentless integration into global finance and enterprise systems, Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network stands at a critical junction. Investors and developers alike now scrutinize LINK’s price trajectory from 2026 through 2030, particularly questioning whether the $100 threshold represents a realistic milestone. This comprehensive analysis examines market fundamentals, adoption metrics, and technological developments that will shape Chainlink’s valuation in the coming years. Chainlink’s Foundational Role in Web3 Infrastructure Chainlink fundamentally operates as a decentralized oracle network, bridging blockchain smart contracts with real-world data. This unique position gives LINK token intrinsic utility beyond speculative trading. The network’s security model requires node operators to stake LINK tokens as collateral, creating consistent demand pressure. Furthermore, Chainlink has established over 1,500 integrations across multiple blockchain ecosystems, including Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche. This widespread adoption demonstrates the protocol’s essential infrastructure status within the broader Web3 landscape. Recent technological advancements significantly enhance Chainlink’s value proposition. The launch of Chainlink Staking v0.2 in late 2024 marked a pivotal development, improving security guarantees while offering more flexible staking options. Additionally, the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) enables secure cross-chain messaging and token transfers. These innovations address critical blockchain interoperability challenges that previously hindered decentralized application development. Consequently, they expand Chainlink’s addressable market substantially. Historical Performance and Market Context Analysis Understanding Chainlink’s future potential requires examining its historical market behavior. LINK demonstrated remarkable resilience during previous market cycles, often outperforming broader cryptocurrency indices during recovery phases. The token’s correlation with Ethereum’s price movements has decreased over time, suggesting growing recognition of its independent value proposition. Market capitalization analysis reveals Chainlink consistently ranks among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by total value, maintaining this position despite intense competition in the oracle sector. Several macroeconomic factors will influence LINK’s price trajectory through 2030. Institutional adoption of blockchain technology continues accelerating, with major financial institutions increasingly exploring decentralized finance applications. This trend directly benefits Chainlink as the leading provider of reliable external data. Regulatory developments also play a crucial role, particularly regarding data privacy and security standards. Chainlink’s decentralized architecture offers advantages in regulatory compliance compared to centralized alternatives, potentially positioning it favorably as regulations mature. Expert Perspectives on Oracle Network Valuation Industry analysts emphasize different valuation methodologies when assessing Chainlink’s long-term potential. Some experts focus on total value secured metrics, which measure the economic value protected by Chainlink’s oracle services. Others analyze transaction fee revenue generated through data requests and staking mechanisms. A consensus emerges around the network effect: as more applications integrate Chainlink, the protocol becomes increasingly difficult to displace, creating sustainable competitive advantages. This network effect could translate directly into token value appreciation as demand for oracle services grows exponentially. Comparative analysis with traditional technology companies provides additional context. Oracle networks function similarly to critical internet infrastructure providers, generating recurring revenue through essential services. This business model typically commands premium valuations in traditional markets. Applying similar valuation frameworks to Chainlink suggests significant upside potential if adoption continues its current trajectory. However, analysts caution that cryptocurrency markets remain volatile, and traditional valuation metrics require careful adaptation to decentralized networks. Technical Analysis and Price Projection Models Multiple analytical approaches inform Chainlink price predictions for 2026-2030. Fundamental analysis examines network usage metrics, including: Number of active oracle networks Total value secured across all integrations Staking participation rates and amounts Cross-chain protocol adoption metrics Technical analysis identifies key price levels and historical patterns. Fibonacci retracement levels from previous market cycles suggest potential resistance and support zones. Moving average convergence divergence indicators help identify trend momentum shifts. Volume analysis reveals institutional accumulation patterns during market downturns, suggesting sophisticated investor interest in LINK’s long-term prospects. Chainlink Price Prediction Summary 2026-2030 Year Conservative Estimate Moderate Scenario Bullish Case Key Drivers 2026 $25-35 $35-50 $50-65 Enterprise adoption, staking growth 2027 $35-45 $45-65 $65-85 Cross-chain expansion, DeFi growth 2028 $45-60 $60-80 $80-100 Institutional integration, new use cases 2029 $55-75 $75-95 $95-120 Mass adoption, regulatory clarity 2030 $65-85 $85-110 $110-140 Global blockchain infrastructure Risk Factors and Market Challenges Despite Chainlink’s strong position, several risk factors could impact its price trajectory. Competition within the oracle sector intensifies continuously, with new protocols offering alternative approaches to decentralized data verification. Technological vulnerabilities represent another concern, though Chainlink’s extensive security audits and bug bounty programs mitigate these risks substantially. Market volatility remains inherent to cryptocurrency investments, potentially causing significant price fluctuations regardless of fundamental developments. Regulatory uncertainty presents additional challenges. Different jurisdictions approach cryptocurrency regulation with varying frameworks, creating compliance complexities for globally distributed networks. Chainlink’s decentralized nature provides some protection against region-specific regulatory actions, but broader cryptocurrency market sentiment often reacts strongly to regulatory announcements. Investors must monitor these developments carefully when considering long-term positions in LINK tokens. The $100 Threshold: Realistic Target or Speculative Hype? The $100 price point represents a psychological milestone for Chainlink investors. Achieving this valuation requires approximately a 5x increase from current levels, assuming stable market conditions. Analysis suggests this target becomes increasingly plausible as blockchain adoption accelerates. Several catalysts could drive LINK toward triple-digit valuations, including major enterprise partnerships, expansion into new industry verticals, and breakthroughs in cross-chain interoperability. However, reaching $100 sustainably requires fundamental growth rather than speculative trading activity alone. Historical precedent offers cautious optimism. Previous cryptocurrency cycles demonstrate that infrastructure tokens often appreciate significantly during adoption phases. Chainlink’s established position as market leader in decentralized oracles provides advantages over newer competitors. The protocol’s continuous development and expanding integration network suggest organic growth potential beyond speculative interest. Nevertheless, investors should maintain realistic expectations regarding timing and market conditions required for sustained price appreciation to $100 and beyond. Conclusion Chainlink’s price prediction for 2026-2030 depends fundamentally on continued blockchain adoption and the network’s ability to maintain its oracle market leadership. The $100 threshold represents an ambitious but potentially achievable target given favorable market conditions and technological execution. Investors should focus on network fundamentals rather than short-term price movements, monitoring adoption metrics, technological developments, and competitive dynamics. While cryptocurrency markets remain inherently volatile, Chainlink’s essential infrastructure role within the expanding Web3 ecosystem suggests significant long-term potential. This Chainlink price prediction analysis provides a framework for informed decision-making, emphasizing the importance of fundamental research in navigating cryptocurrency investments through 2030. FAQs Q1: What factors most influence Chainlink’s price predictions? Chainlink’s price trajectory depends primarily on blockchain adoption rates, oracle network usage metrics, staking participation, competitive dynamics, and broader cryptocurrency market conditions. Technological developments like CCIP expansion also significantly impact long-term valuation. Q2: How does Chainlink’s staking mechanism affect LINK price?

Falling inflation eases pressure for aggressive rate hikes, boosting high-risk assets. With the Fed signaling a more accommodative stance, investors often move into markets benefiting from cheaper borrowing and greater liquidity, cryptocurrencies, led by Bitcoin, typically surge first. Currently, Bitcoin is t rading at $87,400 , reflecting heightened investor optimism amid these macroeconomic shifts. Well, if the Fed moves toward policy easing, it could reignite momentum for digital assets, drawing renewed attention from both retail and institutional investors. Notably, the connection between U.S. inflation trends and crypto performance is clear. Historically, falling inflation and dovish Fed policies have fueled rallies in Bitcoin and other risk assets. As lower interest rates ease borrowing costs and increase liquidity, both cryptocurrencies and equities often surge. Growth-sensitive sectors like technology and consumer discretionary may see especially strong inflows, highlighting how U.S. policy shifts ripple across global financial markets. Market analyst Kamran Asghar notes that while the short-term outlook is bullish, investors should remain cautious of the volatility inherent in crypto and equity markets. Geopolitical tensions, regulatory shifts, and market sentiment can sway prices even amid favorable economic conditions. Declining U.S. inflation is giving the Fed room to ease policy, a move typically bullish for Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, and risk assets like stocks. With Bitcoin holding above $87,000, markets are poised for a potentially dynamic period, offering growth opportunities across both digital and traditional financial markets. Conclusion The recent decline in U.S. inflation paves the way for a more accommodative Federal Reserve, a move that often drives gains in cryptocurrencies and other risk assets. Bitcoin, trading at $87,400, could see renewed momentum, drawing both seasoned and new investors. Easing monetary pressure signals a potentially bullish phase, underscoring how macroeconomic trends increasingly shape digital asset performance.

This strategic bet, placed on the Hyperliquid derivatives platform, has already generated an unrealized profit exceeding $1.48 million, according to verified on-chain data. The transaction, first highlighted by prominent on-chain analyst Ai姨 via social media platform X, provides a compelling case study in sophisticated cryptocurrency market behavior and risk management. Consequently, this event offers valuable insights into the dynamics between large-scale investors, derivative markets, and underlying asset price movements. Decoding the ZEC Whale’s Leveraged Long Position The core of this news story revolves around a single, highly leveraged transaction. Specifically, the investor, identified by a wallet address starting with 0x8de, established a long position on ZEC. This means the trader wagered that the price of ZEC would increase. Crucially, they employed 10x leverage on the Hyperliquid (HYPE) perpetual swaps platform. Essentially, leverage allows a trader to control a position size much larger than their initial capital by borrowing funds. Therefore, the $11.5 million position value was controlled with approximately $1.15 million in collateral. The average entry price for this substantial bet was $446.48 per ZEC token. Following a subsequent price surge, the position’s mark-to-market value increased, creating the reported $1.48 million paper profit. This profit represents a significant return on the initial margin, highlighting the amplified gains—and inherent risks—of leveraged trading. The Mechanics and Risks of Leveraged Crypto Trading Understanding this trade requires a grasp of perpetual swaps and leverage mechanics. Perpetual swaps are derivative contracts that track an asset’s price without an expiry date. Platforms like Hyperliquid facilitate these trades. Leverage magnifies both profits and losses. For instance, a 10% price move becomes a 100% gain or loss on a 10x leveraged position. This mechanism introduces substantial risk, including liquidation. If the price moves against the position by roughly 10%, the exchange automatically closes it to prevent further losses. Therefore, the whale’s timing was exceptionally precise. Market analysts often scrutinize such large leveraged positions because they can signal strong investor sentiment. However, they also represent potential volatility triggers if liquidated en masse. The table below summarizes the key metrics of this notable trade: Metric Detail Asset Zcash (ZEC) Platform Hyperliquid (HYPE) Position Type 10x Leveraged Long Position Size $11.5 Million Entry Price $446.48 Unrealized Profit $1.48 Million Data Source On-chain analyst Ai姨 On-Chain Analysis and Market Context The revelation of this trade came from on-chain analyst Ai姨, a respected figure in crypto analytics. On-chain analysis involves examining public blockchain data to derive insights. Analysts track wallet movements, exchange flows, and smart contract interactions. This field has become crucial for market intelligence. The identification of “whale” wallets—addresses holding large amounts of cryptocurrency—is a common practice. These entities can influence market sentiment and liquidity. The report of this specific ZEC long position provided a real-time glimpse into the strategy of a major player. It is important to note that such data is verifiable and transparent on the blockchain. This transparency is a foundational principle of cryptocurrencies like Zcash, which focuses on privacy for transactions but not for shielding overall network activity and large-scale financial movements on centralized derivative platforms. Furthermore, this event occurred within a broader market context. Zcash, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency launched in 2016, has experienced various market cycles. Large derivative positions often precede or accompany significant price movements. Several factors could provide context for the whale’s bullish stance: Network Developments: Upgrades or improvements to the Zcash protocol. Regulatory Clarity: Evolving global stance on privacy coins. Market Sentiment: A general uptrend in the cryptocurrency sector. Technical Analysis: Key price levels being breached on trading charts. Consequently, the whale’s action may reflect a synthesis of these factors. However, attributing the move to a single cause would be speculative. The factual takeaway is the alignment of a high-value, high-risk trade with a favorable price move. The Role of Derivatives Platforms Like Hyperliquid Hyperliquid represents the growing ecosystem of decentralized finance (DeFi) derivatives platforms. Unlike traditional, centralized exchanges (CEXs), these protocols operate via smart contracts on blockchains. They offer permissionless trading with self-custody of assets. The growth of such platforms has democratized access to sophisticated financial instruments like perpetual swaps. For whales, they provide an alternative with potentially different liquidity profiles and collateral options. The choice of Hyperliquid for this ZEC trade indicates the platform’s depth for such assets. It also highlights a trend where significant capital moves between centralized and decentralized venues based on features, fees, and perceived security. The reliable execution of an $11.5 million order on Hyperliquid validates its capacity in the market. Implications for Retail Investors and Market Dynamics The actions of cryptocurrency whales are closely watched but should be interpreted cautiously. While a large long position can indicate confidence, it is not a guaranteed price predictor. Retail investors face different risk parameters than entities managing millions. Therefore, blind imitation of whale trades is a high-risk strategy. The more valuable lesson lies in understanding market structure. Specifically, large leveraged positions increase systemic risk. A cascade of liquidations can exacerbate price drops. Conversely, sustained large longs can provide underlying support. For the ZEC market, this trade adds a data point for assessing holder conviction. It also demonstrates the maturation of crypto markets, where institutional-grade strategies are deployed on-chain. Moreover, this event underscores the importance of on-chain analytics for modern investors. Tools that track whale wallets, exchange inflows, and derivative open interest are now essential. They provide a layer of market intelligence beyond price charts. The work of analysts like Ai姨 makes this data accessible. Ultimately, this creates a more informed, though complex, trading environment. The transparency forces all participants to consider not just what is happening, but why it might be happening based on observable blockchain activity. Conclusion The ZEC whale’s well-timed, $11.5 million leveraged long position stands as a notable event in the cryptocurrency markets. Executed on the Hyperliquid platform, this high-stakes bet capitalized on an ensuing price surge to generate a substantial $1.48 million unrealized profit. This incident, meticulously reported through on-chain analysis, highlights the sophisticated strategies employed by large-scale investors and the critical role of derivatives in today’s digital asset ecosystem. It serves as a powerful reminder of the amplified opportunities and risks presented by leverage, while also showcasing the unparalleled transparency and real-time intelligence that blockchain technology affords to market participants. As the industry evolves, such clear, data-driven narratives will continue to shape understanding of market mechanics and investor behavior. FAQs Q1: What is a “ZEC whale”? A ZEC whale is a term for an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Zcash (ZEC), giving them the potential to influence the market through their trading activities. Q2: What does a 10x leveraged long position mean? It means the trader used borrowed funds to control a position worth 10 times their initial capital, betting that the price of the asset (ZEC) would rise. This magnifies both potential profits and potential losses. Q3: How do on-chain analysts like Ai姨 discover these trades? They analyze public blockchain data, tracking transactions to and from known exchange and derivative platform wallets, and monitor smart contract interactions on protocols like Hyperliquid to identify large, unusual transactions. Q4: Is an unrealized profit the same as actual profit? No. An unrealized profit (or paper profit) is the current profit on an open position that has not yet been closed by selling the asset. The profit becomes realized only when the position is closed at a favorable price. Q5: Why is the choice of Hyperliquid significant for this trade? Hyperliquid is a decentralized derivatives platform. Its use indicates the growing adoption of DeFi protocols for executing large-scale, sophisticated trades, offering alternatives to traditional centralized exchanges.

According to reports, the two bank officials were responsible for the creation of mule accounts in collaboration with these cybercriminals. The CBI claimed that the bank officials worked hand in hand with the criminals, helping them move their illicit funds through the creation of these mule accounts. Criminals typically use mule accounts to obscure the origin of funds, which are stolen in most cases. After moving them through several local accounts, the funds are then transferred into digital assets before they are moved out of the country. CBI arrests bank officials for aiding cybercriminal operations The CBI mentioned that the most alarming aspect of the whole operation is that the arrested officials were the ones providing tips to the criminals to ensure they evade detection, and their operations ran without any challenges. Both officials were relieved of their duties immediately, and their financial institutions were informed of their roles in the operations. The officials are also awaiting their first appearance in court as the CBI continues investigations. According to the CBI statement, mule money frauds operate a network that starts with the cybercriminals stealing money or digital assets from their victims. Once the theft has been carried out and the criminals are in charge of the funds, the money is then laundered until it is impossible to trace. To make this possible, the criminals move the funds in small denominations across thousands of bank accounts, increasing the number of transactions until it becomes too much to follow. Once they are satisfied with the layered transactions, the money is then exchanged into digital assets and is sent out of India to the top brass of the fraud network. In some cases, the criminals recruit people to source these bank accounts, while in other cases, like this, the bank officials use the bank accounts of innocent people to facilitate the laundering. In addition, the bank officials also altered the real IDs of customers to create new accounts with different names for this purpose. Bank officials will be presented in court In its press release, the CBI mentioned that the officials received money for helping the cybercriminals. The agency mentioned that based on the analysis carried out on digital devices seized during investigations, sufficient evidence pointed the CBI to the then Assistant Manager of Canara Bank in Patna, and the then Business Development Associate of Axis Bank, Patna. Both of them played active roles in aiding the operations of the cybercriminals. Axis Bank released a statement noting that the matter is under active investigation and the bank is cooperating with the authorities so the issue can come to a swift resolution. The statement was released through a spokesperson who added that the bank continues to uphold the highest standards of integrity as a responsible institution. It also noted that the bank maintains zero tolerance for any conduct that violates its policies or code of ethics. Over the last few weeks, banks like HDFC, ICICI, and others have suspended digital account opening due to the rise in money mule accounts. According to Kanishk Gaur, the CEO of Athenian Tech, money mule accounts have been on the rise, and operating such bank accounts can take any form. He noted that sometimes, bank officials help the cybercriminals launder the funds before they’re moved into digital assets, and other times, the customers sell their information to become part of the network. Gaur claimed that the notion behind using so many accounts is just to ensure whoever is tracking the funds gets to several dead ends, and by the time they eventually figure out the source, the funds would have been moved into crypto and sent out of the country. The CBI says its investigation is also looking into the likelihood that the case is connected to others that are currently under investigation. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

The coin was trading at $87,520 at the time of publication and is down 8% since Jan. 1, year to date. Market mood has been weak. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index hit 20 on Dec. 26, marking a stretch of two weeks labeled “extreme fear.” Related Reading: Could XRP Make Trillionaires? Tech Firm Founder Thinks It’s Possible Analysts Split On Market Direction According to posts on X, Jan3 founder Samson Mow contend that 2025 was the bear market and that Bitcoin could be entering a bull run that lasts into 2035. PlanC, another well-known analyst, posted that Bitcoin has never had two red yearly candles in a row and suggested that surviving 2025 meant surviving the bear phase. Those comments have been picked up across industry pages and sparked fresh debate. 2025 was the bear market. https://t.co/1ganX0YSbI — Samson Mow (@Excellion) December 26, 2025 Some Big Price Calls Remain Bullish Several prominent voices still expect sharp gains. Geoff Kendrick at Standard Chartered and Gautam Chhugani at Bernstein each forecast $150,000 for Bitcoin in 2026. Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, predicted $250,000 by 2026, pointing to constrained supply and rising institutional demand as the main drivers. Arthur Hayes and Tom Lee also pushed big targets as recently as October, with $250,000 mentioned as a possible outcome by year-end. Sentiment And Market Data Based on reports, sentiment readings have not helped bullish momentum. The fear index that reached 20 on Dec. 26 stayed in “extreme fear” territory for multiple days. At the same time, Bitcoin’s price sits below many earlier projections. Market watchers note the coin is under pressure even though several forecasts remain optimistic. Bears Put Forward Sharp Downside Scenarios Mike McGlone, senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, expects a decline of roughly 60% from the historical peak above $126,000 by 2026. Jurrien Timmer of Fidelity warned that 2026 could be a “year off,” with prices possibly falling toward $65,000. Those views rely heavily on historical drawdowns and macro headwinds. They carry weight because large drops have happened before, though past behavior does not guarantee future action. Where The Numbers Diverge The spread of projections is wide. Some firms suggest about $150,000, which would represent roughly 74% upside from a cited $86,000 level. Others point to $250,000, while downside scenarios reach $65,000 or worse when measured from the $126,000 peak. That gap shows how different assumptions about supply, demand from institutions, and macro conditions lead to very different price targets.

As quantum computing advances from theory toward practical capability, the durability of blockchain cryptography is becoming a defining factor for networks built to last beyond short-term market cycles. This concern was recently underscored by crypto analyst Pumpius, who drew attention to how the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is already positioning itself for a post-quantum future. His analysis highlights a strategic shift that places XRPL ahead of most blockchains still relying exclusively on cryptographic standards vulnerable to future quantum attacks . I’ve spoken about this before, in depth, long before it was fashionable or even discussed openly. Now it is happening. XRPL is pioneering quantum-resistant transactions using Dilithium cryptography. Dilithium is not experimental hype. It is a lattice-based, post-quantum… https://t.co/WQ06XAtY1c — Pumpius (@pumpius) December 26, 2025 The Quantum Threat to Blockchain Security Most public blockchains today secure assets using elliptic curve cryptography, a system that is highly secure against classical computers but theoretically breakable by sufficiently powerful quantum machines. Governments and critical infrastructure planners understand the risk of large-scale quantum computers exploiting these weaknesses, even though such computers aren’t operational yet. The issue is not whether quantum computing will arrive, but when. For blockchains securing trillions of dollars in value, waiting until that moment would be too late. Dilithium and Post-Quantum Cryptography XRPL’s forward-looking approach centers on post-quantum cryptography, specifically Dilithium, a lattice-based digital signature scheme selected by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Developers designed Dilithium as part of a globally vetted standard to stay secure even with quantum computing threats. By researching and designing pathways for quantum-resistant signatures, XRPL is aligning its cryptographic roadmap with the same standards governments and regulated financial systems are preparing to adopt over the coming decades. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Building Infrastructure, Not Hype As Pumpius noted, deeply technical discussions around deterministic finality, cryptographic resilience, identity layers, and settlement architecture rarely generate mass engagement. Yet these elements are precisely what define whether a ledger can function reliably for decades. XRPL’s development philosophy reflects this reality. The ledger prioritizes predictable settlement, regulatory compatibility, and long-term security over viral narratives or short-term price action. This explains why its evolution often resonates more with institutions and infrastructure planners than with meme-driven retail speculation. XRPL’s Long-Term Vision The exploration of quantum-resistant transactions reinforces a broader pattern in XRPL’s design. Engineers are building the ledger to handle quantum computing, regulated finance, private digital identity, and global-scale transactions. Rather than reacting to emerging threats, XRPL is planning for them in advance. As the industry gradually confronts the implications of quantum technology, this early groundwork may prove to be one of the ledger’s most important strategic advantages.

However, it was finally launched on February 19 when the Open Network brought the PI token to several exchanges, such as Bitget, OKX, and MEXC. In the following weeks, the excitement around the project was quite high. The team extended the KYC grace period, reintroduced PiFest, praised the .pi domain reservation initiative for compliant Pi community apps, and celebrated Pi Day 2025 – all in March. Following the conclusion of the PiFest, the team outlined the Pi Ad Network Expansion, which was opened to all ecosystem-listed applications. Further expansion of network capabilities came in early May when they enabled new wallet activation opportunities. Then came a big hint about what’s about to happen in mid-May, with the community turning its sights on a Binance listing. However, that was another false rumor. Instead, the Core Team outlined the launch of Pi Network Ventures – a Pi-denominated fund aiming to invest $100 million in innovative startups. The team ended the month with a strong statement toward its gaming audience. They celebrated Pi2Day in late June with an ecosystem challenge for all participating Pioneers. More importantly, though, they entered the AI world with the introduction of Pi App Studio. During the summer, the team promoted the launch of the first Hackathon after the mainnet release, which lasted a couple of months. It concluded in October, but the winners were announced in December. Meanwhile, some of the project’s co-founders participated in big conferences, including TOKEN2049 in Singapore. Dr. Fan announced live there the release of Pi DEX and AMM liquidity pools. Pi Network also simplified and improved the KYC procedure by introducing fast-track functions. New updates for the Pi App Studio arrived in October, and Pi Network Ventures made its first investment in OpenMind. November began with the version 0.5.4 network update, followed by more Pi App Studio upgrades, and a partnership with CiDi Games to accelerate Web3 gaming engagement further. December concluded with a special Holiday initiative and new updates to the Pi DEX and AMM. PI Price Review As briefly mentioned above, PI hit exchanges with a bang, quickly surging to a new all-time high of $2.99 in late February. However, this momentum vanished almost immediately, and the asset entered a prolonged bear market. More precisely, it lost almost 95% of its value by early October when it plunged to an all-time low of $0.172. Despite recovering some ground to just over $0.20 as of now, it’s still down by 92-93% since its February peak. It only managed to stage brief price spikes after major community announcements and hints during the year. For example, it skyrocketed to over $1.70 during the speculations in May about a Binance listing, only to fall even harder after those proved wrong. Nevertheless, there are some positives for PI, as it successfully defended the $0.20 support. Some AI platforms believe it could have a better 2026, under certain conditions, which you can explore here .

The projection, shared in a series of posts on the social platform X, places stablecoins at the center of next year’s cryptocurrency narrative and highlights their growing integration into mainstream financial infrastructure. His prediction suggested that there is a high likelihood that digital currencies linked to real-world money will have a significant impact on international finance. Several analysts weighed in on Yakovenko’s statement. They noted that stablecoins are becoming an increasingly important component, playing a crucial role in the cryptocurrency market. The analysts also acknowledged that the Solana co-founder’s confident prediction has prompted investors to shift their focus back towards the cryptocurrency. Yakovenko starts discussion with stablecoin prediction Yakovenko’s recent forecast on stablecoins has hit headlines, spreading swiftly across the crypto industry. Stablecoins are designed to maintain their prices unchanged, in contrast to Bitcoin or Ethereum. Therefore, they are the most preferred means of payment, savings, and transfers in the ecosystem, rather than just focusing on trade. T he stablecoin market is currently valued at over $300 billion . Yakovenko acknowledges the contribution of Solana to the crypto industry Last year, stablecoins on Solana experienced significant growth, reaching a new peak. At this particular moment, several initiatives have adopted this network for the issuance and transfer of digital dollars, thereby increasing its popularity to date. Consequently, this rapid growth of the Solana network for stablecoins prompted Yakovenko to predict that Solana will greatly benefit from the bigger trend he recently forecasted regarding stablecoins. Nonetheless, the Solana co-founder expressed his disapproval of the network dominating the entire crypto market. Instead, Yakovenko perceived Solana as part of a massive shift towards faster and more affordable financial systems. Although he made his argument clear, some experts still urged the industry to exercise caution. At this point, it was confirmed that many support the idea that stablecoins are gaining popularity, but not everyone agrees with Yakovenko’s prediction that the market will reach $1 trillion by 2026. Some of the factors contributing to this finding include the fact that regulation has been identified as a major challenge to date. To address this issue, the government has mentioned that it is examining some effective ways to regulate stablecoins. Additionally, reports suggested that central bank digital currencies could pose stiff competition. Even with this in mind, analysts shared a common argument: stablecoins are now playing a key role in the industry. Moreover, whether the $1 trillion achievement will occur next year or later, one thing is certain: cryptocurrency is increasingly becoming an important tool in today’s finance. Hence, raising the likelihood that stablecoins might soon change people’s sending habits and how they send and save their funds globally.

This severe market reaction followed an official announcement from the Flow Foundation regarding a potential security incident investigation affecting its blockchain network. Consequently, major South Korean exchanges including Upbit, Bithumb, and Coinone immediately suspended FLOW deposits and withdrawals, while South Korea’s Digital Asset eXchange Alliance (DAXA) issued an urgent trading risk warning for the digital asset. FLOW Price Collapse and Immediate Market Reaction Bitcoin World market monitoring data reveals the FLOW token began its precipitous decline during Asian trading hours. Market analysts observed unusually high selling volume that overwhelmed buy orders on Binance. The price movement displayed classic panic-selling characteristics, with the token losing more than half its value within a compressed timeframe. Trading platforms recorded approximately $47 million in FLOW trading volume during the initial two-hour collapse period. This represents one of the most significant single-day declines for a top-100 cryptocurrency asset in 2025. Market participants responded swiftly to the developing situation. Professional traders implemented risk management protocols, while retail investors faced substantial portfolio losses. The broader cryptocurrency market experienced minor contagion effects, particularly affecting tokens within the gaming and NFT sectors where Flow blockchain maintains significant presence. Several decentralized finance protocols built on Flow reported increased withdrawal requests as users sought to mitigate potential exposure. Technical Analysis of the Price Movement Technical indicators showed complete breakdown across multiple timeframes. The FLOW/USDT trading pair breached every major support level between $0.15 and $0.08 without meaningful consolidation. Relative Strength Index readings plunged to historically oversold territory below 20. Trading charts exhibited a classic “gap down” pattern at market open, followed by continuous downward pressure throughout the session. Market depth data revealed extremely thin buy-side liquidity during the decline, exacerbating the price drop magnitude. Flow Foundation Security Investigation Details The Flow Foundation released an official statement confirming an ongoing investigation into potential network security concerns. Foundation representatives emphasized their commitment to transparency while cautioning that the investigation remains in preliminary stages. The statement specifically mentioned examining “unusual network activity patterns” detected by their monitoring systems. Foundation engineers are reportedly conducting forensic analysis of recent transactions and smart contract interactions across the blockchain. Blockchain security firms have begun independent assessments of the Flow network. Preliminary observations suggest increased transaction volume from previously dormant addresses. Network analytics show modified gas fee patterns and altered transaction finality characteristics. The investigation timeline indicates detection occurred approximately 18 hours before the public announcement. Foundation representatives have established communication channels with major exchange security teams to coordinate response efforts. Investigation Scope: Network activity analysis, smart contract audits, validator node assessments Timeline: Detection at 02:00 UTC, internal review until 14:00 UTC, public announcement at 16:30 UTC Communication Protocol: Regular updates promised every six hours via official channels Collaboration: Coordination with exchange security teams and independent blockchain auditors South Korean Exchange Response and Regulatory Implications South Korea’s major cryptocurrency exchanges implemented immediate protective measures following the Flow Foundation announcement. Upbit, Bithumb, and Coinone simultaneously suspended FLOW deposit and withdrawal services at approximately 17:15 UTC. Exchange representatives cited standard security protocols requiring suspension when underlying blockchain networks face potential compromise. The suspension affects both Korean Won and cryptocurrency trading pairs involving FLOW tokens. South Korea’s Digital Asset eXchange Alliance (DAXA) issued a formal trading risk warning for FLOW tokens across all member exchanges. DAXA warnings represent significant regulatory signals within the Korean cryptocurrency market, often preceding more substantial regulatory actions. The warning specifically references “potential network security concerns that may affect token integrity and user asset safety.” Korean financial authorities have reportedly initiated monitoring of the situation, though no official regulatory statements have emerged. South Korean Exchange Actions on FLOW Token Exchange Action Taken Time (UTC) Affected Services Upbit Suspended deposits/withdrawals 17:12 All FLOW trading pairs Bithumb Suspended deposits/withdrawals 17:14 KRW and crypto pairs Coinone Suspended deposits/withdrawals 17:15 All FLOW services Korbit Increased margin requirements 17:30 FLOW margin trading Historical Context of Similar Security Incidents The cryptocurrency industry has experienced numerous security incidents affecting blockchain networks and token values. The 2022 Ronin Network breach resulted in approximately $625 million in losses and triggered significant regulatory responses globally. Similarly, the 2023 Multichain protocol incident demonstrated how network security concerns can rapidly erode token value and user confidence. Security analysts note that transparent communication and swift technical response typically correlate with better long-term recovery prospects for affected projects. Broader Cryptocurrency Market Impact and Sector Analysis The FLOW price collapse generated ripple effects across related cryptocurrency sectors. Gaming and metaverse tokens experienced moderate selling pressure as investors reassessed blockchain security standards. The broader NFT market showed mixed reactions, with some collections migrating discussions to alternative blockchain platforms. Decentralized applications built on Flow reported approximately 23% reduction in daily active users following the announcement. Market analysts observe that security incidents increasingly trigger coordinated exchange responses, particularly in regulated jurisdictions like South Korea. This represents maturation in cryptocurrency market infrastructure compared to earlier industry periods when exchange responses varied significantly. The rapid DAXA warning issuance demonstrates improved regulatory coordination mechanisms within major cryptocurrency markets. These developments suggest evolving industry standards for handling potential blockchain security concerns. Gaming Token Impact: Average 5-8% decline across major gaming cryptocurrencies NFT Market Reaction: Increased migration discussions to Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana DeFi Protocol Response: Temporary pauses on some Flow-based lending protocols Investor Sentiment: Risk aversion increase toward layer-1 blockchain tokens Technical Infrastructure and Network Health Assessment Flow blockchain technical metrics show mixed signals following the security announcement. Network transaction throughput remains within normal parameters at approximately 1,200 transactions per second. Block production continues without interruption across the validator network. However, network participation metrics indicate reduced activity from some institutional validator nodes. The percentage of staked tokens participating in consensus has decreased marginally from 82% to 78%. Smart contract interaction patterns show notable changes, with reduced new contract deployments and modified calling patterns for existing contracts. Network gas fees have stabilized after initial volatility, suggesting reduced congestion despite the security concerns. Developer activity on the Flow blockchain shows temporary pause, with several projects announcing delayed updates until the security investigation concludes. The Flow ecosystem’s technical health will require comprehensive assessment following investigation completion. Investor Protection Measures and Risk Management Recommendations Financial advisors specializing in digital assets recommend specific protective measures during blockchain security investigations. Diversification across blockchain platforms reduces concentration risk during network-specific incidents. Maintaining limited exposure to any single layer-1 blockchain represents prudent portfolio management. Investors should monitor official communication channels for verified information rather than relying on social media speculation. Exchange security teams emphasize fundamental protection strategies during potential network compromises. Enabling two-factor authentication and withdrawal whitelists provides additional account security layers. Monitoring account activity for unauthorized transactions remains essential during periods of network uncertainty. Investors should verify deposit and withdrawal status directly through exchange support channels rather than assuming functionality. Conclusion The FLOW token price collapse on Binance highlights the cryptocurrency market’s sensitivity to blockchain security concerns. The 53% decline from $0.17 to $0.079 demonstrates how potential network incidents rapidly translate into substantial market value erosion. The coordinated response from South Korean exchanges and DAXA illustrates evolving regulatory frameworks for handling digital asset security events. The Flow Foundation investigation outcome will significantly influence FLOW token recovery prospects and broader market perceptions of blockchain security standards. This incident reinforces the critical importance of robust security protocols, transparent communication, and coordinated response mechanisms within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What caused the FLOW price to drop so dramatically on Binance? The FLOW price plummeted 53% following the Flow Foundation’s announcement of a potential security incident investigation. Market participants reacted to uncertainty about network security, triggering substantial selling pressure that overwhelmed buy orders on the exchange. Q2: Which exchanges suspended FLOW trading besides Binance? Major South Korean exchanges Upbit, Bithumb, and Coinone suspended FLOW deposits and withdrawals. These actions followed the security investigation announcement and DAXA’s trading risk warning for the token. Q3: What is DAXA and why is their warning significant? DAXA (Digital Asset eXchange Alliance) represents South Korea’s major cryptocurrency exchanges. Their warnings carry substantial regulatory weight and often precede more formal regulatory actions, significantly impacting market perceptions and exchange policies. Q4: How does this incident compare to previous cryptocurrency security breaches? While investigation details remain limited, the market response resembles patterns observed during earlier blockchain security incidents. The coordinated exchange response demonstrates improved industry coordination compared to historical security events. Q5: What should FLOW token holders do during the investigation? Token holders should monitor official Flow Foundation communications, avoid panic selling based on unverified information, implement additional account security measures, and consider portfolio diversification while awaiting investigation results.

56454227,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=254645,1766845811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Silver Price Prediction: Kiyosaki’s Dire Hyperinflation Warning for the U.S. Dollar,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/kiyosaki-silver-hyperinflation-warning-dollar/,"BitcoinWorld Silver Price Prediction: Kiyosaki’s Dire Hyperinflation Warning for the U.S. Dollar In a stark financial warning reverberating through investment circles, renowned author Robert Kiyosaki has issued a dire forecast linking a potential surge in silver prices to catastrophic hyperinflation for the U.S. dollar. According to a report from The Daily Hodl on May 26, 2025, the ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ author posits that silver breaking the critical $70 per ounce threshold signals profound trouble for fiat currency, with a bold prediction that the precious metal could reach $200 by 2026. Consequently, Kiyosaki advocates for a defensive portfolio strategy centered on tangible assets and leading cryptocurrencies. Decoding Kiyosaki’s Silver Price Prediction and Inflation Thesis Robert Kiyosaki’s analysis rests on a historical and economic framework familiar to students of monetary history. He characterizes fiat currencies, like the U.S. dollar, as ‘fake money’ because their value derives from government decree rather than intrinsic worth. Historically, periods of excessive money printing and soaring national debt have often preceded currency devaluation. Kiyosaki interprets rising commodity prices, particularly in precious metals like silver, as a leading market indicator of this loss of confidence. Essentially, he argues that investors traditionally flock to hard assets when they anticipate the erosion of paper currency’s purchasing power. This perspective is not entirely isolated. For context, silver serves a dual role as both an industrial metal and a monetary asset. Its price is therefore sensitive to both economic demand and investment sentiment. The $70 level Kiyosaki cites is psychologically significant, representing a multi-decade high that, if sustained, could trigger a broader reassessment of inflation expectations. Market analysts often monitor such breakouts for confirmation of long-term trend changes. The Historical Precedent of Hyperinflation While hyperinflation—typically defined as monthly inflation exceeding 50%—remains a extreme scenario, history provides sobering examples. Episodes in Weimar Germany, Zimbabwe, and more recently Venezuela demonstrate how unchecked currency expansion can destroy savings. Kiyosaki’s warning taps into this deep-seated fear, suggesting current U.S. fiscal and monetary policies may be laying a similar groundwork, albeit on a different scale. The U.S. dollar’s status as the global reserve currency provides a buffer, but economists debate the longevity of this privilege amid rising debt levels. Kiyosaki’s Prescribed Hedge: A Four-Asset Strategy In response to this perceived threat, Robert Kiyosaki does not merely diagnose the problem; he proposes a specific countermeasure. His recommended portfolio hedge is a quartet of assets: gold, silver, Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH). This blend is strategic, combining established stores of value with modern digital alternatives. Gold: The traditional, millennia-old safe haven during currency crises and geopolitical turmoil. Silver: As highlighted, it acts as both a monetary metal and a play on industrial demand, often showing higher volatility than gold. Bitcoin (BTC): Framed by proponents as ‘digital gold,’ its fixed supply of 21 million coins presents a stark contrast to expansible fiat currencies. Ethereum (ETH): Represents the foundational asset of the decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contract ecosystem, offering exposure to technological innovation. This diversified approach aims to protect against systemic fiat devaluation while capturing potential growth across both traditional and digital asset classes. The inclusion of cryptocurrencies is particularly notable, reflecting their maturation as a recognized, albeit volatile, asset class for mainstream investors. Market Context and Divergent Expert Views Kiyosaki’s silver price prediction of $200 by 2026 is exceptionally bullish. To appreciate its scale, consider recent price action. Silver has traded between $20 and $30 for much of the early 2020s. A move to $200 would represent an increase of nearly 10x from the $20 base, a scenario requiring a seismic shift in market dynamics. Financial experts offer a spectrum of opinions on such forecasts. Some commodity analysts acknowledge that structural supply deficits and green energy demand (for use in solar panels) could support higher long-term prices. However, many mainstream economists and institutions like the Federal Reserve maintain that current inflationary pressures are transitory and manageable through policy tools. They argue that hyperinflation remains a low-probability tail risk for the United States, citing the independent central bank and deep, liquid bond markets. Comparative Asset Perspectives (2025 Outlook) Asset Kiyosaki’s View Mainstream Caution U.S. Dollar Facing hyperinflation risk (‘fake money’) Remains dominant global reserve currency; inflation targeted Silver Could hit $200/oz by 2026 as inflation hedge Subject to industrial cycle volatility; $200 target seen as speculative Bitcoin Essential digital hedge High volatility; regulatory uncertainty; speculative asset The Role of Monetary Policy and Debt The core of the debate often centers on fiscal sustainability. The U.S. national debt has surpassed $34 trillion, a figure that causes concern for commentators like Kiyosaki. The argument follows that servicing this debt may eventually require the Federal Reserve to monetize it—effectively printing money—which could debase the currency. Conversely, other analysts believe economic growth and technological advancement can outpace debt accumulation, or that political will for fiscal reform will emerge before a crisis point. Conclusion Robert Kiyosaki’s silver price prediction and associated hyperinflation warning for the U.S. dollar present a stark, asset-based narrative for contemporary economic risks. While his $200 per ounce forecast for silver by 2026 sits at the extreme end of market projections, it underscores a growing dialogue about currency debasement and the search for alternative stores of value. His four-asset strategy of gold, silver, Bitcoin, and Ethereum reflects a hybrid approach to modern portfolio defense. Ultimately, investors must weigh such dramatic forecasts against broader economic data, diversified research, and their individual risk tolerance, recognizing that the future path of inflation and asset prices remains a complex and fiercely debated puzzle. FAQs Q1: What is Robert Kiyosaki’s main prediction regarding silver? Robert Kiyosaki predicts that the price of silver could reach $200 per ounce by the year 2026, which he links to a potential warning sign of hyperinflation for the U.S. dollar. Q2: Why does Kiyosaki call the U.S. dollar ‘fake money’? He uses the term ‘fake money’ to describe fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, which are not backed by a physical commodity like gold but rather by government decree and trust in the issuing authority. Q3: What assets does Kiyosaki recommend as a hedge against this risk? Kiyosaki recommends a defensive strategy involving four key assets: gold, silver, Bitcoin (BTC), and Ethereum (ETH). Q4: Is hyperinflation a guaranteed outcome for the U.S. dollar? No, it is not guaranteed. Hyperinflation is an extreme scenario. Many economists view it as a low-probability risk for the United States due to its strong institutions and the dollar’s reserve status, though concerns about long-term debt sustainability persist. Q5: How does silver’s role differ from gold as an investment? While both are precious metals, gold is primarily a monetary metal and safe-haven asset. Silver has significant industrial uses (e.g., electronics, solar panels) in addition to its investment demand, making its price sensitive to both economic activity and monetary sentiment.

Here’s the Meaning,https://timestabloid.com/egrag-crypto-to-xrp-investors-i-see-13-months-of-accumulation-heres-the-meaning/,"Rather than focusing on short-term price swings, crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has shed light on a structure forming on the XRP long-term chart. In his latest post, accompanied by a detailed technical chart, the analyst invites market participants to look beyond daily volatility and consider what he views as a prolonged period of consolidation that could shape the next major move for XRP . The tone of the message centers on discipline and emotional control, urging observers to weigh patience against reactions driven by fear. #XRP What Do You See??? I see 13 months of Accumulation. Patience > Panic and Fear pic.twitter.com/nf9dtcVp3G — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 26, 2025 Thirteen Months of Accumulation on the Chart Egrag Crypto points to what he interprets as roughly thirteen months of accumulation, visible within a rising channel on the chart he shared. The visual analysis emphasizes a steady structure where price action remains supported while gradually pressing higher over time. According to his view, this behavior reflects sustained positioning rather than speculative spikes, suggesting that the market has been absorbing supply and building a base. The chart presentation highlights a broad upward path that XRP has respected over multiple cycles, with price repeatedly reacting within defined boundaries. Egrag labels this structure as a bridge guiding the asset’s long-term trajectory, implying that the current phase is part of a larger technical pattern rather than an isolated development. His perspective describes the recent consolidation as constructive, not a sign of weakness, and encourages followers to interpret the quiet period as preparation rather than stagnation. In reinforcing this outlook, the analyst stresses that emotional responses to temporary pullbacks can undermine strategic positioning. The core message is that remaining steady during extended consolidation may be more important than reacting to every fluctuation, especially when the broader structure remains intact. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Sees Even Longer-Term Context The post also drew engagement from members of the XRP community , including a user named Serkan, who offered a longer-term historical lens on the same chart. In response, he suggested that beneath the recent thirteen-month phase lies an even longer accumulation process stretching back several years. From his standpoint, earlier consolidation produced only a limited upward move, implying that the market may still be in the early stages of a much larger cycle. Serkan’s remarks align with the idea that prolonged bases can influence the scale of future price advances. While his interpretation extends further back in time, it complements Egrag Crypto’s focus on the present structure by emphasizing continuity across cycles rather than isolated periods. Together, these perspectives underline a shared belief within this segment of the community that XRP’s current behavior should be viewed from a long-term perspective.

Aside from the presale mania, which is not only market-driven but has so much to show in regards to growing confidence in Mutuum Finance, the project is also systematically advancing with development stages, hence an extension of its innovative bidirectional lending platform which supports both P2P and P2C lending. These, among many more, demonstrate enormous potential with a high utilization level, ensuring that as an emerging market platform, Mutuum Finance is not only a novel project but a working DeFi solution. Investors increasingly recognize this new crypto as a standout project, solidifying its reputation as the top crypto contender for 2026 and beyond. Given an ever-expanding pool of holders and an explosive presale, Mutuum Finance itself is surely an emerging market dynamo. Early participants are taking advantage of this new crypto while prices are still favorable. Top crypto investors are already taking note, ensuring Mutuum Finance gains momentum as it nears the end of presale Phase 6. Phase 6 Almost Sold Out, Act Fast Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the leader in this market and has raised a handsome amount of almost $19.5 million in presale, which is currently in Phase 6 and expected to reach the complete allocation shortly. After going through various stages of presale with pricing in Phase 1 at $0.01 and in Phase 6 at $0.035, public trading of tokens is set to take place with a significantly higher price at $0.06, a massive jump of 600%. A total of 800 million tokens have been sold with a record 18,580 holders so far. Phase 6 is actually more than 99% sold out, with only a small amount left at the current price. However, the bright side is that phase 7 is also scheduled to go live shortly with a price increase of 20%, which is an opportunity for one to join while the project is still cheap. This new crypto has positioned itself strategically in the DeFi market, ensuring that early adopters will benefit from both utility and growth. Roadmap Mutuum Finance is moving ahead with Phase 2 – “Building Mutuum,” which focuses on the core technological aspects related to the system. Phase 2 comprises of: Final coding stage of smart contracts Testing the internal operations of the protocol Front-end, as well as back-end, development of applications for the decentralized platform Risk management tools for efficient operation After the completion of Phase 2, the next one will be Phase 3 titled “Finalizing Mutuum Finance,” which will include testnet launch and preparation for mainnet. Following a systematic process ensures that when the platform is launched, it is capable of scaling and is also safe and functional. With a solid fundamental base and good initial performance, MUTM is getting into the league of must-watch cryptocurrencies. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the most attractive investments in the crypto market in 2026. It has sold well over 99% of Phase 6, with $19M raised and more than 18,580+ holders. With a testnet launch and a V1 mainnet launch imminent in addition to a P2C/P2P lending function, Mutuum Finance not only provides actual use cases in the realm of DeFi but also has unique tokenomics and a scarcity aspect that can only be associated with projects that are this nascent. This new coin is already being regarded as a must-watch top crypto in the market, reflecting its strong fundamentals and growth potential.

56455182,649034,1766847609,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56455182.jpeg,Charles Hoskinson Reveals What XRP And Cardano Are Already Doing 100x Better,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-cardano-100x-performance/,"Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has criticized legacy finance systems, highlighting that networks like Midnight and XRP are already achieving results 100x beyond the ambitions of these initiatives. His statements seemed to focus on structural design and scalability , suggesting that Cardano and XRP’s advantage lies in their architectures and blockchain capabilities. Cardano And XRP Outpacing Legacy Finance In a post on X, Hoskinson shared pointed commentary on the structural gap between established networks and legacy finance systems connected to Canton , a privacy-focused, interoperable Layer 1 blockchain. He noted how Cardano and XRP are already operating far beyond the ambitions and capabilities of these traditional financial systems attempting to enter Web3. The Cardano founder made clear that his assessment had nothing to do with market cycles or speculative price momentum . Instead, they appeared to highlight the thoughtful design behind Cardano and XRP, and why their respective infrastructures continue to set native blockchains apart from institutional imitations. Notably, both Cardano and XRP were designed with decentralization and global scalability as core requirements. Hoskinson has stated that these features stand in contrast with legacy finance organizations connected to Canton that attempt to adapt blockchain ideas within tightly controlled environments. He indicated that such constraints prevent these systems from realizing their full Web3 potential. A primary example cited by Hoskinson in his discussion is Midnight , a new blockchain developed under his leadership. Midnight is a Layer 1 network designed for programmable privacy , addressing long-standing challenges in data protection and compliance. This blockchain network introduces a dual economic model through its native NIGHT token and a separate DUST resource used for transaction execution and predictable cost maintenance. Based on his statements on X, Hoskinson has positioned Midnight as evidence that Web3-native systems can meet real-world requirements at a robust scale. XRP also presents another pillar of Hoskinson’s comparison. Launched in 2012, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) was designed for high-speed and low-cost settlement of digital assets across borders . Its long operational history and technical stability set it apart from traditional finance systems. Over the years, XRPL has grown significantly, leading to speculation that it could challenge legacy payment rails such as SWIFT . Ripple’s regulatory battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) further tested the blockchain network, with the case’s positive outcome reinforcing its legal and operational standing. All of these factors contribute to Hoskinson’s view of XRP as a mature and battle-tested system operating at a scale 100x that of legacy finance. The Real-World Asset Comparison Hoskinson further explained why he believes that Midnight and XRP are operating at a scale far beyond the ambitions of legacy finance systems with Canton. He argued that tackling the $10 trillion Real-World Asset (RWA) market requires comprehensive technological solutions, not half measures. According to him, only complete end-to-end strategies supported by strong partners and engaged communities can succeed in this tokenization space. He emphasized that Midnight and XRP embody these qualities. Their infrastructure and community support give them a significant edge over traditional finance organizations aiming to enter the Web3 space.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|adausd|ADAUSDT|Canton|Cardano news|Cardano Price|Charles Hoskinson|NIGHT|Real-World Asset|RWA|SWIFT|US SEC|US Securities and Exchange Commission|XRP Ledger|XRPL,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-27 15:00:09

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-says-xrp-is-about-to-be-deployed-heres-why/,"For years, the crypto industry has been dominated by loud narratives—digital gold versus smart contract supremacy, decentralization versus scalability, ideology versus innovation. While these debates captured headlines and investor attention, a quieter story unfolded beneath the surface. One network was not competing for mindshare but preparing for execution, positioning itself for a role far larger than price speculation. That underlying shift was recently highlighted by crypto pundit Xaif, whose post on X argues that XRP is now moving from long-term positioning into active deployment. Rather than framing XRP as a rival to Bitcoin or Ethereum, Xaif presents it as infrastructure—designed to sit at the center of global financial flows , not at their edges. XRP Was Built for Liquidity, Not Narrative Wars Unlike many crypto assets that evolved from community-driven experiments, XRP was architected from inception to solve a specific institutional problem: real-time liquidity for cross-border payments. While the crypto world argued over Bitcoin vs Ethereum, the XRP Army was watching infrastructure get built. They saw XRP for what it truly is: a strategic weapon to acquire, scale, and deploy global financial rails —with XRP at the center of the system, not on the sidelines. For… https://t.co/TllqQ4Yvuj pic.twitter.com/LVqHYf3pJM — Xaif Crypto| (@Xaif_Crypto) December 26, 2025 The XRP Ledger’s speed, low cost, and deterministic settlement directly address inefficiencies in correspondent banking, where capital remains locked in prefunded accounts across borders. This design choice explains why XRP never fit neatly into popular crypto narratives. It was not meant to be digital gold or a generalized smart contract platform. Its purpose was functional—serving as a bridge asset that can source liquidity instantly, enabling value transfer without friction. Regulatory Clarity Changed the Playing Field A major obstacle to XRP’s broader adoption was regulatory uncertainty, particularly in the United States. That barrier has now been removed. The conclusion of the Ripple–SEC case confirmed that XRP itself is not a security in secondary market transactions, restoring legal clarity for institutions and infrastructure providers. This outcome did more than settle a legal dispute. It unlocked participation from entities that require regulatory certainty before deploying capital or integrating blockchain-based systems into live financial operations. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Infrastructure Is Now Ready for Deployment What Xaif emphasizes is timing. Ripple’s expanding global partnerships, real-world usage of On-Demand Liquidity, and the XRPL’s evolution into a multi-asset settlement layer have created conditions where XRP can function as intended. The network now supports tokenized assets, decentralized exchange activity, and advanced security initiatives, aligning with institutional-grade requirements. This is not speculative infrastructure waiting for adoption. It is infrastructure already embedded in payment corridors and financial workflows. From Holding to Using: The Strategic Shift According to Xaif’s assessment, XRP is not an asset designed for an eventual exit. It is an entry mechanism—used to acquire markets, scale financial access, and deploy capital efficiently across jurisdictions. The shift underway is from accumulation to utilization, from debate to execution. If this trajectory holds, XRP’s relevance will no longer be measured by narratives or rivalries, but by how deeply it is embedded in the financial rails it was built to power.

The Solana-based meme coin platform completed its PUMP token sale on July 12. Interestingly, the offering sold out in roughly 12 minutes. Largest Token Sales of 2025 The sale followed a revision to the public allocation, which was reduced to 12.5% of the total 1 trillion token supply, after 18% had already been distributed through a prior private sale. Participation required KYC verification. According to the project, the token launch is tied to Pump.fun’s strategy to expand into on-chain social and live-streaming use cases. The remaining supply is distributed across team allocations, ecosystem and community incentives, liquidity, investor allocations, and foundation and streaming-related funds. According to CryptoRank’s compiled data, the second-largest raise came from World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi project backed by US President Donald Trump, which has raised around $550 million since launching its public token sale. The most recent round concluded in March and covered 25% of WLFI’s 100 billion token supply. WLFI co-founder Zak Folkman has said that approximately 63% of the total supply is intended to be sold to the public over time, which means that further sales may follow as the project continues its roll-out. Outside the top two, capital inflows were more fragmented but still significant across projects. For instance, Layer 1 blockchain Monad ranked third with $217 million raised. The network went live on November 24 and was accompanied by an airdrop of its MON token. While MON has a total supply of 100 billion tokens, only about 10.8% is currently unlocked and circulating. Other Blockchain Token Sales “High-performance” Ethereum scaling solution, MegaETH, followed with $78 million. The Layer 2 is backed by investors including Dragonfly Capital and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Privacy infrastructure also featured prominently. Aztec Network, for one, secured $52 million for its zero-knowledge-based Ethereum Layer 2. Plasma, a stablecoin-focused blockchain designed to combine Bitcoin’s security with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, raised $50 million, supported by investors such as Founders Fund, Framework Ventures, and Bitfinex. Rounding out CryptoRank’s top 10 were Gensyn with $16 million, Solayer with $10.5 million, Sahara AI with $8.5 million, and Lombard with $6.7 million.

Armstrong’s public condemnation, delivered via social media platform X, highlights the intensifying conflict between established financial institutions and emerging fintech companies over the future of digital currency regulation in the United States. This confrontation emerges as stablecoins—digital assets pegged to traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar—gain increasing prominence in global financial systems, with daily transaction volumes exceeding $50 billion across major blockchain networks according to recent 2024 industry reports. Coinbase CEO Confronts Banking Sector Over Stablecoin Legislation Brian Armstrong’s public statement represents a significant moment in the ongoing regulatory debate surrounding digital assets. The Coinbase CEO specifically accused banking institutions of attempting to stifle competition from fintech companies regarding reward payments on stablecoins. Armstrong asserted that banks are pressuring Congressional representatives to revisit and potentially amend the Genius Act, legislation currently under consideration that would establish comprehensive regulatory frameworks for dollar-pegged digital currencies. Furthermore, he predicted that banking institutions would eventually seek authorization to offer interest and rewards on stablecoins themselves, creating what he characterized as an unethical positioning strategy against emerging competitors. The current version of the Genius Act contains specific provisions that prohibit stablecoin issuers from paying interest directly to holders while permitting third-party platforms to offer rewards programs. This distinction creates a regulatory separation between currency issuance and financial services that banking institutions reportedly find objectionable. Industry analysts note that this legislative approach mirrors existing regulatory frameworks governing traditional banking products, where deposit-taking and lending activities face strict separation requirements. Consequently, the banking sector’s lobbying efforts appear focused on either extending these traditional restrictions to cryptocurrency platforms or obtaining similar privileges for themselves within the digital asset space. Understanding the Genius Act and Stablecoin Regulation The proposed Genius Act represents the United States’ most comprehensive legislative attempt to regulate stablecoins since the emergence of cryptocurrency markets. First introduced in late 2023, the legislation aims to establish clear regulatory parameters for dollar-pegged digital assets, which have grown to represent approximately 10% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. The bill’s name derives from its technical approach to regulating these assets, focusing on their underlying mechanisms rather than their surface characteristics. Key provisions include mandatory reserve requirements, regular auditing procedures, and specific disclosure obligations for all stablecoin issuers operating within U.S. jurisdictions. Notably, the legislation distinguishes between three primary categories of market participants: Issuers: Entities responsible for creating and redeeming stablecoins Custodians: Platforms holding stablecoins on behalf of users Service Providers: Third-party companies offering additional financial services This regulatory framework intentionally separates the function of currency issuance from financial services, creating what supporters describe as necessary consumer protections. However, critics argue this structure disadvantages traditional financial institutions while favoring technology companies with existing cryptocurrency infrastructure. The debate reflects broader tensions between innovation-focused regulatory approaches and stability-oriented financial oversight that have characterized digital asset discussions for nearly a decade. Historical Context of Cryptocurrency Banking Relations The current conflict between Coinbase and traditional banking institutions represents the latest chapter in a complex relationship spanning nearly fifteen years. Since Bitcoin’s emergence in 2009, traditional financial institutions have maintained an ambivalent stance toward cryptocurrency technologies—simultaneously exploring potential applications while expressing concerns about regulatory compliance and market stability. Banking sector lobbying efforts regarding digital assets have intensified significantly since 2020, with financial institutions reportedly spending approximately $75 million annually on related advocacy according to OpenSecrets.org data. This historical context reveals a pattern of increasing institutional engagement with cryptocurrency markets. Major banking institutions initially dismissed digital assets as speculative instruments with limited practical application. However, as stablecoin transaction volumes surpassed $1 trillion annually in 2023, traditional financial entities began developing their own digital currency initiatives while simultaneously advocating for regulatory frameworks that would advantage their existing business models. This dual approach has created tension with cryptocurrency-native companies like Coinbase, which argue that innovation should drive regulatory development rather than protection of established interests. Banking Sector’s Stablecoin Strategy and Market Implications Traditional banking institutions have developed increasingly sophisticated approaches to digital asset regulation over the past three years. Industry analysts identify three primary strategic objectives in current banking sector lobbying efforts regarding stablecoin legislation: Strategic Objective Current Approach Potential Impact Regulatory Parity Advocating for identical rules across traditional and digital finance Could slow innovation but increase stability Competitive Positioning Seeking restrictions on fintech reward programs Might protect existing revenue streams Future Market Access Preparing for eventual digital currency offerings Would expand banking service portfolios These strategic considerations reflect banking institutions’ recognition of stablecoins’ growing importance in global finance. Recent Federal Reserve research indicates that stablecoins now facilitate approximately 70% of all cryptocurrency trading activity and have begun displacing traditional payment methods for certain cross-border transactions. This market evolution has prompted traditional financial institutions to reconsider their digital asset strategies, with several major banks reportedly developing proprietary stablecoin technologies while simultaneously advocating for regulatory frameworks that would disadvantage existing cryptocurrency platforms. The economic implications of this regulatory battle extend beyond individual companies to affect broader financial innovation. Stablecoin technologies offer potential benefits including reduced transaction costs, increased settlement speed, and enhanced financial inclusion—particularly for unbanked populations estimated at 1.4 billion globally. However, these benefits must be balanced against legitimate concerns regarding financial stability, consumer protection, and monetary policy transmission. The current debate essentially centers on whether regulatory frameworks should prioritize innovation or stability, with banking institutions generally advocating for the latter approach while fintech companies emphasize the former. Legal and Regulatory Landscape for Digital Assets The United States regulatory environment for digital assets remains fragmented and evolving as of early 2025. Multiple federal agencies claim jurisdiction over various aspects of cryptocurrency markets, creating a complex compliance landscape for industry participants. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has pursued enforcement actions against several cryptocurrency platforms under existing securities laws, while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has asserted authority over certain digital asset derivatives. Meanwhile, banking regulators including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Federal Reserve have issued guidance affecting financial institutions’ interactions with cryptocurrency markets. This regulatory fragmentation has created uncertainty that both traditional financial institutions and cryptocurrency companies seek to resolve through legislative action. The Genius Act represents one of several proposed solutions, with competing bills offering alternative approaches to digital asset regulation. Banking sector lobbying efforts appear focused on ensuring that any eventual legislation incorporates traditional financial regulatory principles including capital requirements, liquidity standards, and consumer protection measures that have developed over decades of banking oversight. Cryptocurrency advocates counter that digital assets require fundamentally new regulatory approaches that acknowledge their technological distinctiveness rather than forcing them into existing regulatory categories. International Regulatory Developments and Comparisons The United States regulatory debate occurs within a broader international context of evolving digital asset frameworks. The European Union implemented its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in 2024, establishing comprehensive rules for cryptocurrency issuers and service providers across member states. Similarly, the United Kingdom has developed its own regulatory approach through the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023, which grants regulators expanded authority over digital assets. Asian jurisdictions including Singapore and Japan have implemented nuanced regulatory frameworks that distinguish between different categories of digital assets based on their characteristics and use cases. These international developments create competitive pressures for U.S. regulators, as cryptocurrency companies may choose to operate in jurisdictions with clearer regulatory frameworks. Industry analysts note that regulatory uncertainty has already prompted several cryptocurrency firms to expand operations outside the United States, potentially affecting the country’s position in the growing digital asset economy. The current debate over stablecoin regulation therefore carries implications beyond domestic financial policy to affect international competitiveness and technological leadership in emerging financial technologies. Conclusion Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s critique of banking sector lobbying against the Genius Act stablecoin bill highlights fundamental tensions in the evolving relationship between traditional finance and emerging digital asset technologies. The debate encompasses complex considerations regarding financial innovation, regulatory philosophy, market competition, and consumer protection that will likely shape financial systems for decades. As stablecoins continue gaining prominence in global transactions, regulatory frameworks must balance innovation encouragement with stability preservation—a challenging task that has prompted intense advocacy from all market participants. The eventual resolution of this regulatory debate will significantly influence the future development of digital assets, potentially determining whether cryptocurrency technologies integrate with traditional finance or develop as parallel systems with distinct characteristics and applications. FAQs Q1: What is the Genius Act stablecoin bill? The Genius Act is proposed U.S. legislation that would establish comprehensive regulatory frameworks for dollar-pegged digital currencies called stablecoins. The bill includes provisions regarding reserve requirements, auditing procedures, disclosure obligations, and specific rules about interest payments and reward programs. Q2: Why are banks lobbying against the current version of the Genius Act? Traditional banking institutions are reportedly lobbying against certain provisions of the Genius Act that they believe disadvantage their business models while favoring fintech companies. Specifically, banks object to rules that allow cryptocurrency platforms to offer rewards on stablecoins while restricting similar activities by traditional financial institutions. Q3: What are stablecoins and why are they important? Stablecoins are digital assets pegged to traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar, designed to maintain stable value. They facilitate cryptocurrency trading, enable faster and cheaper cross-border payments, and serve as bridges between traditional finance and digital asset markets. Their importance has grown significantly, with daily transaction volumes exceeding $50 billion. Q4: How does the current regulatory debate affect cryptocurrency users? The regulatory debate affects cryptocurrency users by determining what services will be available, what protections will exist, and how easily they can interact with traditional financial systems. Regulatory clarity could increase user confidence and service availability, while restrictive regulations might limit innovation and service options. Q5: What are the potential outcomes of this regulatory conflict? Potential outcomes include modified legislation that addresses banking sector concerns, separate regulatory frameworks for traditional and fintech companies, delayed implementation of comprehensive stablecoin regulation, or continued regulatory uncertainty that affects market development. The resolution will significantly influence how digital assets integrate with traditional financial systems.

This operational framework, commencing at 10:00 p.m. UTC on Sundays and concluding at 3:00 p.m. UTC on Saturdays, establishes a new standard for continuous coverage in a market that never sleeps. Consequently, this announcement arrives at a critical juncture, as the cryptocurrency sector increasingly demands reliable, around-the-clock information to navigate its volatile and decentralized nature. Bitcoin World’s 24-Hour News Service Explained Bitcoin World’s newly detailed schedule provides unprecedented clarity for its global audience. The service operates continuously from Sunday at 10:00 p.m. UTC through to Saturday at 3:00 p.m. UTC. This 140.5-hour weekly window ensures coverage across all major global trading sessions, including Asia, Europe, and the Americas. During the scheduled interim period from Saturday afternoon to Sunday evening, the platform will shift to a breaking news only mode. This model prioritizes major market-moving events, such as regulatory announcements, significant security breaches, or substantial price movements in top-tier assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This structured approach addresses a key challenge in crypto journalism: information overload. By maintaining full-scale operations during peak market hours and a filtered service during typically quieter periods, Bitcoin World aims to deliver high-signal content. Industry analysts note that this mirrors the operational cadence of traditional financial news wires, which also calibrate staffing and output to market liquidity and activity cycles. The schedule is not arbitrary; it aligns with historical data on trading volume and news flow within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The Critical Need for Continuous Cryptocurrency Coverage The cryptocurrency market’s decentralized and global nature fundamentally necessitates 24/7 news coverage. Unlike traditional stock exchanges with set opening bells, digital asset trading occurs on a continuous basis across hundreds of platforms worldwide. A major policy announcement from a Asian regulator can instantly impact European traders during their morning, while a late-night technical upgrade in the United States can sway Asian markets. Therefore, the absence of real-time information creates arbitrage opportunities and increases risk for participants. Historically, the crypto news landscape has struggled with this demand. Many outlets operated on standard business hours, creating dangerous information gaps. Bitcoin World’s formalized schedule represents a maturation of the industry’s media infrastructure. It acknowledges that market participants require a consistent, reliable source of information to make informed decisions, manage risk, and understand complex technological developments. This service directly supports market efficiency and transparency, two pillars essential for broader institutional adoption. Operational Insights and Industry Context Implementing a true 24-hour news cycle requires significant logistical planning and resource allocation. Newsrooms must manage shift patterns across time zones, ensure editorial consistency, and maintain rigorous fact-checking protocols at all hours. The defined “interim” period for breaking news likely allows for essential maintenance, team coordination, and in-depth analysis preparation for the coming week. This periodization is a strategic choice, balancing comprehensive coverage with sustainable operations and journalistic depth. Furthermore, the timing of the weekly restart at 10:00 p.m. UTC on Sunday is strategic. This coincides with the beginning of the financial week in East Asia and Australasia, regions with profound influence on cryptocurrency markets. By being fully operational as Asian markets open, Bitcoin World ensures it captures the first waves of news and sentiment that will flow westward through Europe and then to the Americas. This geographic and temporal alignment demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of global capital flows. Impact on Traders, Investors, and the Broader Ecosystem The implications of a reliable, scheduled 24-hour news service are far-reaching. For active traders, especially those employing algorithmic or high-frequency strategies, timely news is a direct input for trading models. Even a few minutes’ delay in reporting a major event can equate to significant financial loss or missed opportunity. For long-term investors and institutions, continuous coverage provides a clearer audit trail of market-moving events, aiding in portfolio analysis and regulatory compliance. The service also benefits developers, project teams, and researchers. Real-time reporting on network upgrades, protocol changes, and developer activity allows for quicker community response and collaboration. The table below contrasts the old and new information paradigms in crypto media: Aspect Previous Model (Ad-hoc) Bitcoin World’s Scheduled Model Availability Unpredictable, often limited to business hours Clearly defined 24/5.5 schedule with breaking news protocol Predictability Low; users unsure of coverage times High; users can plan around a known schedule Content Filtering Inconsistent during off-hours Focused breaking-news filter during interim period Global Alignment Often centered on a single time zone Designed to cover all major trading sessions sequentially This structured approach reduces uncertainty, a major source of anxiety and inefficiency in volatile markets. It empowers all ecosystem participants with a shared, timely information baseline. Conclusion Bitcoin World’s formal announcement of its 24-hour news service schedule marks a pivotal step toward professionalism and reliability in cryptocurrency journalism. By providing a transparent operational framework, the service meets the market’s inherent demand for continuous information while introducing necessary structure. This development supports price discovery, risk management, and informed participation across the global digital asset landscape. Ultimately, as the industry evolves, such institutional-grade infrastructure in news reporting will be seen not as a luxury, but as a fundamental component of a mature and trustworthy financial ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What are the exact operating hours for Bitcoin World’s full news service? The full service runs from 10:00 p.m. UTC on Sunday until 3:00 p.m. UTC on Saturday each week. Q2: What happens during the period from Saturday 3:00 p.m. to Sunday 10:00 p.m. UTC? During this interim period, Bitcoin World will provide updates only for major breaking news stories that significantly impact the cryptocurrency markets. Q3: Why is a 24-hour news service important for cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency markets trade continuously across the globe. Major news can break at any hour and instantly affect asset prices, making real-time information essential for traders and investors worldwide. Q4: How does this schedule benefit users in different time zones? The schedule is designed to cover all major global trading sessions in sequence (Asia, Europe, Americas). The weekly restart aligns with the Asian market open, ensuring coverage as liquidity enters the market. Q5: Does this mean less news will be published during the interim period? Not necessarily less, but more focused. Only high-impact, breaking news will be published, filtering out less urgent updates to provide clarity during typically lower-activity periods. Q6: Is this type of scheduled news service common in the crypto industry? Formal, transparent 24-hour schedules are still emerging. Bitcoin World’s announcement sets a clear standard for operational transparency and reliability in crypto media.

In 2028, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $13,634.03 and $16,144.48 with an average expected price of $14,027.80. In 2031, ETH could trade between $37,652.16 and $45,802.41 with an average price of $39,049.08. The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps using blockchain technology without intermediaries, enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps traders trade Ethereum more easily. So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2025 through 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Symbol ETH Current price $2,929.40 Market cap $353.59B Trading volume (24-hour) $12.17B Circulating supply 120.7M All-time high $4,891 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time low $0.4209 on Oct 22, 2015 24-hour high $2,983.69 24-hour low $2,894.95 ETH price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 3.79% (Medium) 50-day SMA $ 3,045.95 200-day SMA $ 3,355.26 Sentiment Bearish Fear and Greed Index 23 (Extreme Fear) Green days 15/30 (50%) Ethereum (ETH) price analysis ETH remains below the 200-day and short-term moving averages showing continued bearish pressure Momentum indicators stay weak with MACD negative and RSI stuck in neutral territory Price is consolidating under the $3,000 resistance zone suggesting limited upside until a strong breakout occurs Ethereum price analysis 1-day chart: Ethereum struggles below $3,000 as bears defend $3,050 while support holds near $2,750 Ethereum’s daily chart on Dec 27 shows a consolidation between bearish and neutral after the November selloff. Price is hovering near $2,925, below the Bollinger midline around $3,024, keeping sellers in control. The upper band near $3,299 marks the first significant breakout zone, while the lower band near $2,748 serves as the key downside pivot. ETHUSD chart by TradingView RSI is subdued at ~44, signaling weak momentum and room for either a bounce or another leg down. A daily close back above $3,050 would improve structure toward $3,300. Failure to hold $2,900 risks a slide to $2,750. Watch volume on push; repeated rejections at $3,000 could keep ETH range-bound into year-end. ETH price analysis on the 4-hour chart: Ethereum stuck between $2,905 support and $3,000 resistance as momentum fades ETH is consolidating on the 4-hour chart near $2,926 after a sharp mid-month drop, with price hovering around the Bollinger midline near $2,937. The lower band around $2,905 is immediate support; losing it opens room toward $2,850 then $2,800. ETHUSD chart by TradingView Buyers need a close above $2,969 and the psychological $3,000 zone to shift control, with $3,050 as the next hurdle. MACD is still below zero, but the histogram is flattening, suggesting sell pressure is cooling. Balance of Power remains negative, so rallies may fade. A range likely persists unless a breakout occurs, so watch $2,905 and $3,000 closely. ETH technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 3,455.37 SELL SMA 5 3,274.39 SELL SMA 10 3,176.06 SELL SMA 21 3,119.90 SELL SMA 50 3,045.95 SELL SMA 100 3,542.95 SELL SMA 200 3,355.26 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 3,047.99 SELL EMA 5 3,168.75 SELL EMA 10 3,467.74 SELL EMA 21 3,806.92 SELL EMA 50 3,857.13 SELL EMA 100 3,538.47 SELL EMA 200 3,175.33 SELL What to expect from ETH price analysis next? Ethereum is likely to remain range-bound in the near term as price consolidates between key support near $2,900 and resistance around $3,000–$3,050. The 4-hour structure shows weakening momentum, with the MACD flattening and price struggling below the mid Bollinger Band, suggesting limited bullish strength. However, downside pressure is also easing, indicating sellers are losing control. A clean break above $3,050 could open the door toward $3,200, while failure to hold $2,900 risks a pullback to $2,750–$2,800. Expect choppy price action until a decisive breakout confirms direction. Why is Ethereum down today? Ethereum is down today mainly due to persistent selling pressure after failing to reclaim the $3,000 psychological level. On the charts, ETH remains below key moving averages, signaling weak short-term momentum. The 4-hour MACD is still in bearish territory, while price action is compressed under the mid Bollinger Band, showing limited buying strength. RSI remains neutral reminders that bulls lack conviction. Broader market caution and profit-taking after recent rebounds have also reduced risk appetite. Until ETH breaks back above $3,000–$3,050 with volume, sellers are likely to maintain control and keep prices under pressure. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum blockchain is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. However, the opinions expressed are not investment advice; traders should consider researching before investing. What is a realistic price for Ethereum in 2025? The realistic price for Ethereum in 2025 is around $5,281.96 at the maximum. What will 1 Ethereum be worth in 2030? One Ethereum is expected to be worth $32,957.06 maximum in 2030. How high can ETH realistically go? Ethereum’s price potential depends on multiple factors, including market trends, institutional adoption, network upgrades, and macroeconomic conditions. Realistically, ETH could reach $5,000 to $7,000 in the next bullish cycle if demand increases and Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions and scalability improvements boost adoption. If institutional interest strengthens, ETH may push past $10,000 over the long term, especially if Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform. However, volatility remains a key risk, with price corrections likely along the way. Regulatory clarity and Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) efficiency could also positively influence its long-term valuation. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2027, with a potential high of $11,277.45 Will ETH reach $25,000? Based on price predictions, Ethereum is unlikely to surpass the $25,000 level by 2029. By 2029, the ETH’s potential high is expected to be $23,277.35. This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, so long-term projections should be cautiously approached. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, the Ethereum platform will likely reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $45,802.41 in 2031. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $45,802.41 mark by 2031, so holding it longer can be beneficial. Recent news/ opinion on Ethereum Ethereum Foundation confirms December 3 launch date for Fusaka Mainnet Upgrade According to an article by Cryptopolitan, the Ethereum Foundation confirmed that the Fusaka mainnet upgrade will launch on December 3 , following successful testnet deployments on Holesky, Sepolia, and Hoodi. As part of “The Surge” roadmap, Fusaka focuses on improving transaction throughput and data efficiency, paving the way for danksharding and Ethereum’s broader scalability advancements. Ethereum price prediction December 2025 In December 2025, Ethereum is projected to reach a minimum price of $4,414.92, an average price of $4,573.88, and a maximum price of $5,281.96. Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) December 2025 $4,414.96 $4,573.88. $5,281.96 Ethereum price forecast 2025 Ethereum has a strong potential to push towards $4,414.96 and $5,281.96 by the end of 2025, with an average of $4,573.88 as adoption accelerates. With Layer-2 scaling, growing institutional trust, and deflationary supply, ETH looks poised for steady appreciation, making it one of the most resilient and optimistic assets in the crypto market.

By then, ETH’s deflationary supply dynamics and global acceptance as a settlement layer could drive demand sharply higher, supporting optimistic long-term price appreciation. Ethereum price prediction 2028 In 2028, the price of one Ethereum is expected to be at least $13,634.03 The average price of ETH in 2028 is expected to be $14,027.80, with a potential high of $16,144.48. By this stage, global adoption in finance, enterprise solutions, and tokenized assets is expected to be widespread. Combined with advanced scaling solutions and deflationary supply mechanics, ETH demand is expected to surge, supporting higher valuations. Ethereum ETH price prediction 2029 It is expected that the price of Ethereum to be at least $19.235.71 in 2029. The average trading value of Ethereum in USD is $19,796.82, but the price can go as high as $23,277.35. However, this is supported by its position as a global financial and digital infrastructure backbone. By then, tokenization of real-world assets, enterprise adoption, and government-level blockchain use are expected to accelerate. Ethereum price prediction 2030 By 2030, Ethereum’s forecast minimum price could rise to $26,948.54, while the expected average trading price is projected at $27,938.38. A potential high that may reach $32,957.06, showcases Ethereum’s increasing appeal to investors. Ethereum price prediction 2031 According to the forecast and technical analysis, the price of Ethereum should be at least $37,652.16 in 2031. The average price of ETH is $39,049.08– but it can go as high as $45,802.41. This is underpinned by its full integration into global finance, enterprise infrastructure, and digital identity systems. With widespread tokenization, institutional dominance, and deflationary tokenomics, ETH is positioned as a core digital asset, driving sustained demand, long-term scarcity, and strong upward momentum in valuation.

Between November 1 and December 3, 2025, Ethereum retraced from a strong start near $3,590 (around Nov 3) to a trough near $2,745-2,770 by Nov 21 — a downward swing reflecting broad market weakness. In late November ETH rebounded. By Nov 26-27 it climbed back into the $3,015–3,030 range before easing again in early December, signaling consolidation around $2,950 – $3,050 as of Dec 3.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-27 15:30:35

While the premier cryptocurrency and the rest of the crypto market floundered, other asset classes enjoyed significant Christmas season rallies. These recent performances suggest that the Bitcoin price might indeed be at the beginning of a bear market. According to the latest on-chain data, the price of BTC might be heading down to as low as $41,500 in the imminent period of extended downward movement. BTC Price To Reach Next Bottom In October 2026 In a new post on the X platform, Alphractal founder and CEO Joao Wedson has put forward a target and timeline for the Bitcoin price in the coming bear season. According to the on-chain expert, the market leader’s price could form its next cycle bottom around early October 2026.

This projection is based on the Repetition Fractal Cycle chart, which portrays how market patterns and price movements repeat themselves on different scales. Using investor behavioral patterns, this chart helps to predict price tops and bottoms across different timeframes. As shown in the chart above, a 4-year cycle is marked by various periods, starting with accumulation, then markup and distribution, before ending with the bear market. Wedson revealed that the most favorable time window for the next accumulation phase would likely be between October 6, 2026, and October 16, 2026, according to historical cycle symmetry. The Alphractal founder added that the price target for Bitcoin by the start of this accumulation phase is between $41,500 and $45,000. In essence, the bear market phase, which the premier cryptocurrency seems to only be at the start of, could see the price of BTC fall as much as 50% from the current price point. Wedson warned in his post: This is not a fixed rule, nor a deterministic price forecast. It represents a fractal rhyme of market cycles — something Bitcoin has historically respected more often than ignored. Markets do not repeat exactly — but they rhyme with an uncomfortable frequency. If the price of Bitcoin goes to around $45,000 from the current point, it would represent a roughly 65% decline from the cycle top. This is significantly lower than the over 75% correction seen in the last bear market in 2022. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $87,550, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours.

New Altcoin Named Among 2025’s Most Promising Projects,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/next-big-crypto-under-0-05-new-altcoin-named-among-2025s-most-promising-projects/,"There is an abrupt change that is sweeping the crypto market. Bitcoin is withdrawing at the recent highs. Ethereum has been hovering around major levels. Cryptocurrency projects that were previously associated with high profits decline. With the occurrence of this, the focus tends to circulate speedily. According to industry observers, capital is shifting to utility-oriented DeFi crypto, and particularly those projects that appear to be poised to continue running ahead as others decelerate. That is the attention that is now being attracted by one new crypto. The Sudden Interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an emerging project that a number of traders are beginning to pay closer attention to. It is geared around lending and borrowing which serve more effectively in the case when markets become nervous. Mutuum Finance is geared towards organised usage, rather than hype of price. On the higher level, the protocol is developing to allow users to loan out assets, collect yield, and borrow with collateral in a regulated manner. Demand in lending usually surges when volatility is high as users seek to obtain a stable return or short-term liquidity without asset sales. This provides the lending protocols with a vindictive advantage in the turbulent environment. Timing is what also grounds the story. Mutuum Finance is set to launch V1 on Sepolia testnet in the Q4 2025, according to official X-statements. This puts the project in a stage where development is highly accomplished, although there is yet to begin more extensive usage. Participation Surge and What the Numbers Are Signalling The MUTM participation metrics are on a steady rise. The project has collected an amount of approximately $19.45M and got approximately 18,650 holders. These statistics are important as they are a measure of interest prior to the launch of the protocol. The initial confidence manifested in financing and increase in the number of holders in most instances appears initially. Attention to price normally comes in later. According to market commentators, this trend is common when a project is transitioning between unspoken development to broad visibility. These figures do not present themselves in the form of promotion, but as signs of what can be seen. These indicate the number of participants that are ready to make a commitment before they reach full utility. Such behavior is likely to concentrate around the projects which are perceived to be less risky compared to at an early stage concepts. Price Progression, Supply Flow and Token Structure MUTM is in Phase 6 with a price of $0.035. The amount of tokens that can be in circulation is limited to 4B. That supply, approximately 1.82B MUTM, is assigned to the early stages which comprises about 45.5%. The token price has been fluctuating through various structured phases since the beginning of the year 2025. It began at around $0.01 and has been rising in intervals as each stage got filled. This gradual model leads to price development that is predictable instead of the abrupt development in price. Remaining supply is narrower at Phase 6. There is evidence that historically, a token at later stages tends to behave differently in terms of price. Buyers tend to act faster. Larger allocations are earlier portrayed. Most think that the expectation level is going to be restored once again by the next stage; with V1 coming close there are many people who think new expectations will be set. Infrastructure and Security One of the reasons as to why MUTM is not just a short-term trade is security. The project has undergone a CertiK token scan of the score 90 out of 100. This includes the areas of risk and general contract checks. Halborn Security is further undergoing an overall review of the basic lending agreements. This is important to a DeFi crypto since the funds of users are handled by lending protocols. The integrity of the code and the level of audit are vital. Mutuum Finance too declared a bug bounty of $50k that targets the weaknesses of the code. Other than audits, this opens external testing by security researchers. At the infrastructure level, the roadmap will encompass oracle integrations to have proper pricing, stablecoin plans so that it can borrow with predictability and Layer-2 expansion to minimize fees and speed up. These aspects reinforce long term plans as opposed to hasty implementation. Why Timing is the Boss Phase 6 allocation is snuggling up. Whales have recently been allocated in the range of $100k. When the supply is tightened and bigger customers come into the picture, the market would behave differently. It is further enhanced by a 24-hour leaderboard. It also provides the best contributor with $500 of MUTM on a daily basis, which continues the interaction. Card payments will also be introduced, which reduces friction and may speed up participation. With Q1 being 2026 near, many observers feel like Mutuum Finance is going through a thin canoe. There is almost complete infrastructure preparedness. Security layers are in place. Supply is tightening. Something is beginning to shift the focus.

Yet history shows that price action alone often fails to capture what is truly happening beneath the surface—especially during periods of broad market stress. While sentiment remains divided, deeper signals suggest the current downturn may be more misleading than it appears. That argument was recently advanced by X Finance Bull, who explained on X that XRP’s decline is largely driven by macroeconomic pressure affecting the entire digital asset market, not by a breakdown in XRP’s fundamentals. According to the pundit, focusing solely on price obscures the more important story unfolding around institutional behavior. Macro Pressure, Not XRP Failure X Finance Bull stresses that XRP’s price is moving in line with a wider risk-off environment. Liquidity tightening, cautious investor sentiment, and market-wide pullbacks have weighed on nearly all crypto assets. In such conditions, even assets with strong underlying demand can experience prolonged consolidation or drawdowns. Crucially, this macro-driven pressure does not reflect institutional rejection. Instead, it creates windows where accumulation can occur quietly, without the volatility typically associated with speculative rallies. NO ONE BELIEVES $XRP … UNTIL IT’S TOO LATE. They told you ETFs were already priced in. Then XRP became the fastest alt ETF in history to hit $1B AUM. No outflows. No red days. Just institutional size moving in with conviction. XRP ETFs absorbed +$666M in Nov. Another… https://t.co/mFwQoqLGT5 pic.twitter.com/rX8kAJNysS — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) December 26, 2025 XRP ETFs Tell a Different Story One of the strongest data points highlighted by X Finance Bull is the performance of XRP exchange-traded funds. Despite claims that ETF enthusiasm was already priced in, XRP ETFs reportedly became the fastest altcoin ETFs to reach $1 billion in assets under management. More telling is the flow data. XRP ETFs absorbed approximately $666 million in November and another $470 million in December, without recording a single outflow day. During the same period, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs experienced hundreds of millions of dollars in net outflows. XRP products, by contrast, logged more than 30 consecutive days of net inflows, signaling sustained institutional conviction rather than short-term speculation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Supply Lockups Quietly Tighten the Market Beyond ETF inflows, supply dynamics are also shifting. X Finance Bull points to an estimated 686 million to 740 million XRP currently locked, effectively reducing available circulating supply. While such changes do not always trigger immediate price reactions, they materially alter market structure over time. Supply constraints combined with steady accumulation can create conditions where future demand has a disproportionate impact once broader market pressure eases. Why Institutions Continue to Accumulate XRP At the center of institutional interest is utility. XRP offers compliance-ready settlement, deep on-chain liquidity, and fast global transaction finality —features that align closely with institutional requirements. These attributes matter more to long-term capital allocators than short-term price fluctuations. As X Finance Bull argues, price weakness does not negate strategic accumulation. Instead, it often accompanies it. Markets frequently misinterpret these phases, focusing on surface-level metrics while ignoring capital flows that signal long-term positioning. For those watching closely, the message is clear: XRP’s price may be down, but institutional intent appears firmly intact.

Bit.com has advised its users to migrate their assets through the provided options, such as direct withdrawals and migration to its partner platform Matrixport, before it shuts down by the end of March. Bit.com’s plan for a gradual shutdown The cryptocurrency exchange Bit.com announced through its social media channels on December 27 that it will wind down its operations through a business restructuring. Consequently, it launched a “User Asset Migration Plan” to help customers withdraw or transfer their holdings. The exchange released a detailed timeline running through March 31, 2026. Bit.com has promised to complete “all transparent and traceable migration of user assets within a clear time window” while maintaining equal treatment for all account types during the withdrawal process. Which services will Bit.com stop? Starting immediately, Bit.com has suspended new user registrations. Existing customers can still login, view their assets, and participate in the migration process. The platform says normal withdrawal applications will be processed within 0.5 to 24 hours. Priority verification will be available to users through customer service for any delays exceeding one working day. Spot trading on the exchange will continue until January 31, 2026, after which all trading function s st op. Users can withdraw assets directly or convert holdings to USDT before the deadline. Afterwards, any remaining small non-USDT assets will be automatically converted to USDT at closing prices, excluding observation area currencies, which users must withdraw manually beforehand. Opening new contract trading positions has already been disabled. Users can only close existing positions. Cloud computing power services will terminate on January 25, 2026, with all mining income settled at that time. Users with active cloud mining orders will receive refunds for unfulfilled service days calculated from January 25 to the expiration date of the original order. Automatic income calculations for financial product holders will continue until January 30, 2026. After settlement, users must withdraw assets themselves through the app for supported currencies like USDT. What should Bit.com users do now? Users can withdraw funds normally from the main platform until January 31, 2026. From February 1, assets that have still not been withdrawn will be moved to a backup station system, where users can only register and withdraw assets. The exchange has clarified that assets will not be cleared, confiscated, or disposed of during this phase. March 31 is the final chance to apply for withdrawals through the backup station’s customer service channels. If you have funds on Bit.com, only rely on its official website announcements and the official app for legitimate information. As is usually the case, fraudsters and bad actors already have systems to take advantage of Bit.com’s situation. The exchange has also issued fraud warnings, reminding users that official communications will never request passwords, SMS verification codes, mnemonics, or private keys through private messages. The exchange will not ask users to transfer funds to “security accounts.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

By 2028, ADAUSD could reach $1.45. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $4.54. Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.3530 Market Cap $12.68B Trading Volume (24-hour) $388.18M Circulating Supply 44.99B ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.3572 24-hour Low $0.3449 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 7.77% (High) 50-day SMA $ 0.4411 14-Day RSI 35.57 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 23 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 10/30 (33%) 200-day SMA $ 0.6850 Cardano (ADA) price analysis ADA remains in a clear downtrend below key moving averages with weak bullish momentum Failure to break the 0.38 to 0.40 resistance zone triggered renewed selling pressure Market caution and low buyer confidence continue to limit short-term recovery Cardano price analysis 1-day chart: Cardano slips toward $0.35 support as bears defend $0.387 resistance On Dec 27, Cardano (ADA/USDT) continues to trade in a downtrend on the daily chart, currently hovering near $0.355, well below the mid-Bollinger Band around $0.387 and the upper band near $0.457. Price action remains compressed close to the lower band at $0.317, reflecting sustained bearish pressure. The RSI at ~37 shows weak momentum, suggesting limited buying interest but also increasing chances of a short-term relief bounce. ADAUSD 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains negative, although the shrinking histogram indicates selling pressure is gradually easing. Immediate support lies at $0.35, followed by $0.317, while resistance stands at $0.387 and $0.457. A daily close above $0.387 would signal early recovery, while failure to hold $0.35 risks another downside leg. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart: Cardano slips toward $0.35 as bears defend $0.36 resistance Cardano remains in a clear 4-hour downtrend, sliding from the mid-$0.40s toward $0.354. Price is hovering around the Bollinger mid-band/20-SMA near $0.3541, but repeated rejections keep ADA capped, while the lower band at $0.3456 marks the first downside line. ADAUSD 4-hour price chart by TradingView The upper band around $0.3626 is the next key resistance before any meaningful recovery. MACD is still negative, yet the chart is flattening, suggesting bearish momentum is fading rather than reversing. A hold above $0.35 could invite buyers. Otherwise, a break under $0.345 may quickly accelerate selling into year end. ADA technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.5144 SELL SMA 5 $0.4619 SELL SMA 10 $0.4287 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.4152 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.4411 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.5813 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.6850 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.4062 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.4495 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.5460 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.6608 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.7346 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.7402 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.7299 SELL What to expect from the Cardano price analysis next? Cardano’s next phase is likely to remain bearish to neutral unless buyers reclaim key resistance. Price is consolidating near $0.35–$0.36, a critical demand zone that has so far prevented deeper losses. However, the trend structure still favors sellers, with ADA trading below its short and mid-term moving averages. If $0.35 breaks, downside could extend toward $0.32–$0.30. On the upside, a sustained move above $0.38 would be the first sign of trend recovery, potentially opening a push toward $0.42–$0.45. Momentum indicators suggest weak conviction, so expect choppy, range-bound trading in the near term. Why is Cardano down today? Cardano is down today due to a combination of technical weakness and cautious market sentiment. On the charts, ADA remains below key moving averages, confirming a prevailing downtrend and limiting upside momentum. Price recently failed to reclaim the $0.38–$0.40 resistance zone, triggering renewed selling pressure and short-term profit taking. The RSI remains near the lower mid-range, showing weak buyer conviction, while momentum indicators suggest sellers still control the trend. Broader crypto market uncertainty and reduced risk appetite are also weighing on altcoins. Without a strong breakout above resistance, traders remain defensive, keeping ADA under pressure in the short term. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2025, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Cardano hitting $5 seems quite achievable given past levels. With its ATH around $3.10, $5 would only need to beat that peak by about 60%. A solid bull run and some serious adoption could usher in a unit price of $5. Will Cardano reach $10? Cardano hitting $10 is a long shot. Its all-time high was around $3.10 back in 2021, so $10 would mean more than tripling that peak. From current prices, that’s over a 13x jump. While crypto can be unpredictable, that would need massive adoption and a bull run far beyond what we saw in 2021. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano hitting $50 is extremely likely. With ADA’s current supply of around 35 billion tokens, a $50 price would require a market cap of approximately $1.75 trillion. Even in crypto’s craziest bull runs, that kind of valuation doesn’t happen for altcoins. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from $10 to $50 or more. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. What that number will be remains to be seen. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges. Recent news/opinion on Cardano Cardano closed 2025 with major progress toward fully decentralized governance driven by the implementation of CIP-1694 and active community participation. The Cardano Foundation supported this transition through responsible voting power distribution, a complete tenure on the Interim Constitutional Committee, and extensive DRep activity. Delegation programs expanded with over 360 million ADA assigned to builder and adoption-focused DReps. Governance accessibility improved through open-source voting tools, educational resources, flow charts, and community events. Collaboration with Intersect strengthened committees across civics, technical steering, budget planning, and strategy. Overall 2025 marked a year of maturation and unity as Cardano advanced its long-term decentralized governance vision. 2025 was a monumental year for Cardano governance. From the transition to decentralized governance to deeper collaboration across the ecosystem as an Enterprise Member of @IntersectMBO , the year marked true progress. Read the full 2025 governance recap: https://t.co/4tWhBUFA1p — Cardano Foundation (@Cardano_CF) December 3, 2025 Cardano price prediction December 2025 Cardano’s December 2025 forecast is expected to be $0.4-$0.45, averaging $0.44, driven by steady network development, including smart contract enhancements and scaling upgrades. The growing use of Cardano-based DeFi, NFTs, and governance projects supports moderate bullish sentiment. However, cautious market conditions and slow institutional momentum may limit rapid price expansion, maintaining this controlled range.

By 2026, Cardano’s price could trade at a maximum of $0.60. Cardano’s historic price sentiment Cardano price history by Coingecko Cardano, founded in 2015 and launched in 2017, gained popularity for its eco-friendly Ouroboros Proof-of-Stake system and affordability. The 2021 Alonzo upgrade introduced smart contracts, boosting scalability and interoperability, driving ADA to its all-time high of $3.09 before dropping to $0.22 by mid-2023. In 2024, ADA showed volatility, peaking at $1.3264 in December before closing the year at $0.8451 after multiple corrections throughout the year. 2025 began with ADA near $1.09 but prices fell below $0.60 by March, then recovered above $0.70 by May and ranged between $0.51–$0.82 through July. From August to November 2025, ADA fluctuated between $0.74 and $0.96, showing brief rallies followed by pullbacks, with current consolidation around $0.80. In early October 2025, Cardano (ADA) traded around $0.78–$0.82, showing mild bullish momentum after September’s consolidation. Mid-October saw a decline toward $0.70, as selling pressure increased and market sentiment weakened. By early November, ADA stabilized between $0.68 and $0.72. In early November ADA traded around $0.61 — closing at about $0.609 on Nov 1 and $0.612 on Nov 2 . Over the next two weeks it held in the $0.58–0.61 range before gradually drifting lower. Mid-November saw modest strength, with ADA climbing to ~$0.53–0.56 before breaking lower around Nov 14. By Nov 20–22 the price dipped under $0.41–$0.43, reflecting broader downward pressure. In late November and early December ADA continued sliding — arriving near $0.38–0.44 by Dec 3–4, then trading close to $0.42–$0.43 around Dec 6–7.",Crypto Price Predictions|ADA,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-27 16:24:00

The ongoing debate, which culminated in a highly polarized and controversial DAO vote, highlights broader structural challenges facing DeFi protocols that evolved under restrictive regulatory conditions but now operate at an institutional scale. Governance Proposal Sparks Heavy Debate Despite Rejection At the center of the ongoing controversy was a proposal to bring Aave’s brand and front-end assets under direct DAO control, following accusations that Aave Labs redirected protocol-generated fees without prior community approval. Notably, pseudonymous DAO member EzR3aL alleged that fees generated from the DeFi protocol’s integration with decentralized exchange aggregator CoW Swap were routed to a wallet controlled by Aave Labs. The critic argued that these fees should have accrued directly to the DAO, drawing an equal opposition from members of Aave Labs. Ultimately, a proposal review was submitted to the DAO seeking complete control of the protocol’s brand assets, such as domains, social media handles, naming rights, etc. Interestingly, more than 55% of voting power opposed the measure, 41% abstained, and just 3.5% voted in favor. Commenting on the event, Wintermute CEO Evgeny Gaevoy shared some crucial insights. While recognizing the expectation mismatch between Aave Labs and governance token holders as to who is eligible to what, Gaevoy also criticized the proposal, which he described as premature and lacking critical details. The Wintermute boss said: I disagree with the forum proposal as it stands now. It makes no sense to commit to a course of action without knowing the specifics. It’s far from obvious how the entity owning the front end and brand would be governed, whether it would be for profit or not, and whether it would actually guarantee value accrual to token holders. Gaevoy describes value accrual as the “heart of the problem and nudges the Aave Labs to take significant steps in resolving this issue. Aave CEO’s Response, Vote-Buying Claims, And Path Forward Following the vote, Aave founder and CEO Stani Kulechov addressed the controversy, emphasizing that disagreement is a natural feature of decentralized governance. He acknowledged shortcomings in communication and pledged to better articulate how Aave Labs’ products generate value for the DAO and general token holders in the spirit of economic alignment. Kulechov also rejected claims of vote manipulation tied to his recent $15 million AAVE purchase, stating that the tokens were not used to influence the governance process, but rather showcase his conviction in the DeFi project. Looking ahead, Kulechov stressed that the Aave ecosystem is large enough to support multiple service providers and is committed to improving transparency and alignment. “$AAVE will win,” he concluded, signaling confidence that the protocol can emerge stronger and unified from the governance controversy.",Crypto News|Aave DAO|Aave Protocol|Evgeny Gaevoy|Governance proposal|Stani Kulechov|Wintermute,EN,0,0,AAVE|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-27 16:30:23

Recent price action shows hesitation and compression rather than trend continuation, suggesting the market is waiting for a decisive catalyst before the next directional move. Technical Analysis The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, Bitcoin is still respecting a broader descending structure following the recent impulsive selloff. The price is currently confined between a well-defined demand zone in the $82K–$80K range and a major resistance band near $95K–$96K. The repeated failure to reclaim the mid-range resistance highlights persistent sell-side control, while the lower highs structure confirms that bullish momentum remains weak. The market is now trading closer to the lower half of the range, where buyers have previously stepped in to defend the price. However, the absence of strong bullish displacement from this zone suggests that demand is reactive rather than initiative-driven. As long as BTC remains below the $95K resistance and the descending trend structure stays intact, the daily bias remains neutral to bearish, with consolidation or gradual downside continuation still favored. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart provides clearer insight into the current market behavior. The primary cryptocurrency is consolidating within a tight range following a prolonged selloff, forming a compression zone below the rising short-term wedge and overhead resistance. This price action reflects equilibrium between buyers and sellers rather than accumulation, as BTC repeatedly fails to break higher with conviction. Recent upside attempts have been rejected quickly, indicating that supply remains active on minor rallies. At the same time, downside pressure has slowed near the $85K–$86K region, where short-term demand continues to absorb sell orders. This price behavior suggests a range-bound environment, with liquidity being built on both sides before an expansion. A clean breakdown below the consolidation would open the path toward the $82K demand zone, while a sustained reclaim above the short-term resistance would be required to shift the intraday bias to the bullish side. Until such a decisive breakout occurs, however, the 4-hour structure supports continued choppy price action and liquidity-driven moves rather than trend development. Source: TradingView Sentiment Analysis The futures average order size data highlights a clear shift in market participation, with recent activity increasingly dominated by smaller traders. As price oscillates below recent highs, the chart shows a visible rise in retail-sized orders, while whale activity has notably cooled off. This behavior typically reflects late-stage participation, where smaller traders become more active after major directional moves have already played out. During the earlier bullish phases, larger order sizes were more consistently present, indicating stronger institutional or whale involvement driving price expansion. In contrast, the current environment shows a lack of sustained large orders, suggesting that smart money participation has either paused or moved into a more defensive stance. Without consistent whale-sized orders entering the market, upside momentum tends to weaken, leaving the price more vulnerable to volatility and downside pressure. The dominance of retail-sized futures orders around the current price region reinforces the idea that recent rebounds are not being supported by strong conviction from larger players. Historically, this type of order flow imbalance often precedes extended consolidation or further corrective moves, as retail-driven rallies struggle to absorb overhead supply. Unless a clear resurgence in large order activity emerges, the on-chain structure continues to align with a cautious to bearish short-term outlook for Bitcoin.

Despite multiple attempts, buyers have struggled to generate follow-through momentum. The recent price action reflects a market caught in indecision, with weakening bullish conviction and no real dominance from sellers. Meanwhile, on-chain data is starting to stir, hinting that the next move could be brewing beneath the surface. Technical Analysis The Daily Chart On the daily chart, ETH continues to consolidate between the $2,700 support zone and the $3,300 resistance, with price hovering around $2,970 at the time of writing. The 200-day EMA (orange) and 100-day EMA (blue) continue to act as dynamic overhead resistance and have also printed a bearish crossover. This makes them a key confluence zone just above $3,300, where the price was previously rejected. The RSI also remains below the midline, suggesting no momentum shift yet in favor of buyers. A close below $2,700 would likely trigger a retest of the $2,200 macro demand area, while reclaiming $3,300 could open the door toward $3,700 and beyond. For now, the market lacks a catalyst strong enough to break out of this compression. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart Zooming into the 4H chart, ETH is still respecting the local trading zone between $2,800 and $3,000, moving sideways around the mid-range again. Price action has been choppy, with failed breakouts both above and below, showing clear indecision from both sides. The RSI has started climbing again, which could indicate some short-term upside, but without reclaiming the $3,000–$3,100 supply zone, buyers remain at a disadvantage. If the price consolidates above $3,100 again with strength, a rotation back to the upper resistance at $3,300 could be expected, but the structure still favors range-bound trades as things stand. Source: TradingView On-Chain Analysis Exchange Reserve Ethereum’s exchange reserves have been trending down consistently for most of 2025, reflecting a long-term trend toward accumulation or self-custody. This has historically been interpreted as bullish, as fewer tokens on exchanges generally mean less sell pressure. However, the recent chart shows a subtle but clear uptick in reserves, which is the first in months. This could mean two things: either traders are preparing to cut their losses from recent consolidation, or larger players are repositioning ahead of a spike in volatility. If this reserve build-up continues, it could point to increased potential for sell-side activity in the short term. That said, one uptick doesn’t change the long-term accumulation trend yet. It is still important to monitor whether this is a one-off move or the beginning of a broader sentiment shift. If it is paired with price rejection at resistance and rising open interest, it could confirm preparation for downside positioning.

Chalom put a bold number on it: 10X TVL in 2026. That claim ties together rising stablecoin use, bigger tokenization of real-world assets, and increased interest from big financial groups. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forecasts For 2026 Range From $65K To $250K As Sentiment Hits ‘Extreme Fear’ Stablecoin Activity On Ethereum Based on reports, the total stablecoin market stands at about $308 billion now and could grow to $500 billion by the end of next year, a rise of roughly 62%. Over half of all stablecoin activity — about 54% — happens on Ethereum. That math matters: more stablecoin flows on Ethereum tends to lift the protocol’s TVL because many of those dollars sit in smart contracts for swaps, lending, and liquidity pools. Sharplink Gaming holds 797,704 Ether, worth roughly $2.30 billion at the time of publication, a signal that some public treasuries are already staking big bets on the network. Tokenized Assets Gain Traction Chalom also expects tokenized real-world assets to expand rapidly, forecasting a $300 billion market for RWAs in 2026 and saying tokenized assets will 10X in AUM next year as funds, stocks, and bonds get wrapped onchain. In 2026, I believe Ethereum’s Total Value Locked (TVL) will increase 10X. Why and how? 🧵 Views ≠ investment advice. — Joseph Chalom (@joechalom) December 26, 2025 He points to rising interest from mainstream firms like JPMorgan, Franklin Templeton, and BlackRock. Reports note that sovereign wealth funds may increase their Ethereum exposure by five- to tenfold, which could bring large, patient capital into tokenization projects and protocol deposits. Ethereum Price Action Ethereum was trading near $2,921 on December 25, 2025, giving the network a market value of about $352 billion, while 24-hour trading volume came in at roughly $11.47 billion. Over the course of 2025, ETH moved through a full market swing. It opened the year around $3,298, climbed to about $4,390 in August, and stayed below its record high of $4,942, before sliding back to the $2,921 area by year-end. Price swings were heavy, with annual volatility close to 140%. Technical readings show mixed momentum. The weekly RSI sits at 41.7, placing Ethereum in a neutral-to-bearish zone, while the daily MACD histogram remains negative at -0.15. Price action has also been boxed into a narrow band between $2,774 and $3,038. Futures data adds to the cautious tone. Total open interest stands near $37 billion, down 0.62% over the past 24 hours, pointing to reduced exposure from traders. Liquidation data shows more than $100 million in potential long liquidations clustered between $2,880 and $2,910, an area now seen as a key pressure point.

According to crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen, Ether is unlikely to hit new highs next year given current Bitcoin conditions. That caution lines up with technicals that point to range-bound trading and with the fact that open interest has eased slightly. The liquidation cluster near $2,880–$2,910 shows where leveraged positions could be forced out, and that kind of stress can push price moves faster than fundamentals.

Such news, whether verified or not, has captured attention because it signals growing interest from the world’s largest asset manager in the XRP ecosystem. In a market increasingly driven by institutional flows, even unconfirmed reports can reshape sentiment and spark conversations about the next phase of XRP adoption. This narrative was amplified by JackTheRippler on X, who shared an unverified rumor alongside a video juxtaposing BlackRock CEO Larry Fink dodging questions on crypto ETFs with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s optimism for expanded ETF products. While entertaining and viral in nature, the post underscores the community’s focus on institutional engagement, highlighting that major asset managers could play a transformative role in the XRP market. RUMORS: BlackRock will file for a SPOT #XRP ETF in 2026! pic.twitter.com/pqrtJ2We6j — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) December 27, 2025 BlackRock’s Position and Market Speculation BlackRock has steadily expanded into digital assets through Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, demonstrating a cautious but deliberate embrace of crypto. However, as of now, there is no official confirmation from BlackRock regarding a spot XRP ETF filing. Analysts warn that while some interpret Fink’s non-committal remarks as hints, these rumors are attention-grabbing but shouldn’t be taken as fact until there’s an official announcement or regulatory filing. Regulatory Clarity Boosts ETF Prospects Ripple’s regulatory landscape has shifted dramatically following the conclusion of its legal case with the U.S. SEC in 2025. The settlement clarified that XRP is not a security in secondary market transactions, removing a significant barrier that previously constrained institutional participation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This regulatory clarity has reignited conversations around XRP-linked ETFs, making future filings—including from firms like BlackRock—more plausible, even if not yet confirmed. Institutional Interest in XRP ETFs Beyond speculation, the XRP ETF ecosystem is already seeing real traction. Asset managers such as Grayscale, VanEck, and Franklin Templeton have filed or explored XRP ETFs, signaling meaningful institutional demand. While the rumored BlackRock filing remains unverified, its potential participation would reflect growing recognition of XRP’s utility: a fast, compliance-ready settlement asset capable of serving global financial flows. Rumor vs. Reality For now, the idea that BlackRock will file a spot XRP ETF in 2026 remains a rumor, amplified by social media and community chatter. While it highlights the market’s optimism and institutional interest, investors should treat it cautiously and focus on verified developments. Still, the speculation underscores an undeniable truth: XRP continues to attract attention from major players, and the possibility of large-scale institutional adoption remains a compelling narrative.

By 2028, the minimum WLD price is expected to drop to $2.47, while its maximum could reach $2.93. The price of Worldcoin is expected to reach a maximum level of $4.79 in 2031. Worldcoin (WLD) is garnering significant attention from both investors and enthusiasts, which may indicate its future performance and current price, a trend that aligns with broader market predictions. In early May, WLD experienced a notable surge, quickly positioning itself among the top-performing altcoins. This rise coincided with a spike in activity surrounding advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly those related to OpenAI. The increased interest in Worldcoin is likely fueled by speculation surrounding potential collaborations and future projects that could integrate AI technology into the cryptocurrency space, further driving its market momentum.

Buyers continue to defend the $0.4838–$0.49 area, maintaining a stable short-term structure. Higher lows on the 4-hour chart show strengthening momentum, but a confirmed move above $0.50 is still required. On December 27, 2025, Worldcoin (WLD) trades at $0.4968, posting a 2.01% intraday gain as price action remained supported by steady buying interest. The token moved within a defined range, with resistance at $0.4969 limiting upside attempts and support at $0.4838 acting as a strong demand zone where pullbacks were absorbed, keeping the short-term structure constructive. Worldcoin 1-day price chart: WLD shows stabilization near key support level On the 1-day timeframe, Worldcoin (WLD) remains in a clear consolidation phase, signaling a market still searching for direction. Price action stayed capped below the $0.50 psychological resistance, while buyers consistently defended the $0.485–$0.49 support zone, keeping the daily range confined between $0.4838 and $0.4969 and reflecting controlled volatility. WLD/USDT Chart: TradingView Structurally, daily candles pointed to stabilization rather than expansion, with repeated recoveries from lower levels showing steady demand absorption. Momentum remained neutral-to-positive, as higher intraday lows hinted at early accumulation, while persistent supply near the upper boundary continued to limit bullish follow-through. Worldcoin 4-hour price chart: WLD short-term momentum gradually shifts bullish On the 4-hour chart, WLD displays a clearer short-term recovery pattern following the early-session dip. The price formed a sequence of higher lows, reclaiming and holding above the $0.49 level, which acted as an intraday pivot. This shift reflected improving short-term sentiment, as buyers stepped in more aggressively after the pullback. WLD/USDT Chart: TradingView The 4-hour structure suggested bullish control within a narrow range, but without confirmation of a breakout. Sustained trading above $0.50 would be required to accelerate gains, while a failure to maintain support above $0.49 could expose WLD to another test of the lower demand zone near $0.485.

WLD is likely to remain range-bound in the near term as long as price trades below the $0.50 psychological resistance. A clean break and sustained close above $0.50 could open the door for short-term continuation, supported by improving 4-hour momentum and higher lows. Conversely, a rejection at current levels may trigger a pullback toward the $0.49 pivot, with $0.485–$0.4838 remaining the key demand zone to watch for trend preservation. Is Worldcoin a good investment? Worldcoin (WLD) is stabilizing just below the $0.50 resistance, trading at $0.4968 on December 27, 2025. The token remains range-bound between $0.4838 and $0.4969, with buyers defending support and absorbing pullbacks. Daily and 4-hour charts show neutral-to-positive momentum, marked by higher lows and early accumulation. A sustained move above $0.50 is needed for a breakout, while failure to hold $0.49 could test support near $0.485. Overall, WLD shows bullish potential, but confirmation above resistance is key for further gains. Why is the WLD Price up today The WLD price is up today, rising 2.01% to $0.4968, due to steady buying interest and support at key levels. Buyers have been defending the $0.4838–$0.49 zone, absorbing pullbacks and maintaining short-term stability. Additionally, higher lows on the 4-hour chart indicate strengthening momentum, signaling that traders are gradually accumulating WLD ahead of a potential breakout above the $0.50 resistance. Controlled volatility and market consolidation have also contributed to the upward move, as the price remains range-bound with demand outpacing supply at lower levels. Recent news Worldcoin has launched its AMPC update, a major upgrade led by co-founders Alex Blania and Sam Altman to enhance privacy, performance, and decentralized biometric verification, featuring a new price prediction tool.

During a live chat with podcast host 0x_tiago, Pietro from the Lighter team shared more about what Lighter is all about, as well as solid alphas concerning the now confirmed airdrop. When is the Lighter airdrop? According to Pietro’s chat, the airdrop and TGE can be expected to happen before 2025 runs out, which leaves roughly 4 days, long enough for anything to happen. The TGE & airdrop have been confirmed to happen in 2025, with 25% of the supply dedicated to the airdrop and no vesting period involved. There will be no claim process either, as the token will be airdropped directly into the point holder’s Lighter wallet . Those curious about the tokenomics details will have to be patient, as it will be rolled out gradually. What we do know for sure is that 50% of the supply will go to the community, and buybacks have been planned. After the airdrop, value is designed to accrue to the token equity holders, who are also token holders. In plain terms, this means that value will flow to the token. The token will go live on Lighter first. The team claims it has no plans to pay for CEX listings, but Coinbase and Bybit have already added $LIT on their respective roadmaps. There have been questions about an official NFT, but during the chat, it was revealed that there was none. However, some releases might come from some prominent community members like Fuegonft. Even though the airdrop campaign has come to an end, the Lighter representative reiterated that it intends to remain a cheap platform to trade on, especially when one accounts for spreads and fees. Revenue is generated from premium accounts and liquidations, so there are no fears that it won’t turn profits just because people stop using it after they get their drops. Also, Lighter has promised it is not going to develop an L1. Instead, it plans to optimize for the future with a zkEVM sidecar. The sidecar brings composability with the broader DeFi landscape and is planned to launch in H1 2026. During the chat, it was made clear that Lighter is being positioned to rival CEXs and not compete with other DEXs. It already has a mobile app in the works to rival CEX apps, and the team is reportedly working on options, tokenized stocks and other RWAs. ​ Hyperliquid has already listed $LIT Speculations on the Lighter airdrop increased even more after Hyperliquid’s listing of the yet-to-launch Lighter token against $USDC on Monday at community request. It is available as a pre-market perpetual contract called LIT-USDC hyperps, and allows users to long or short the yet-to-be-launched token with up to 3x leverage. The day before the listing, on Sunday, Lighter sent out an airdrop allocation form, which gave users the option to direct tokens to up to four additional wallets. The optional form also lets users allocate different token amounts to each wallet, with submissions accepted through Friday. According to what Sebas said on Discord, if users do not submit the form and are eligible, the airdrop will be sent to their main Lighter account. Lighter transferred 250 million $LIT tokens, representing 25% of the total supply, on Friday. The move has sparked community speculation that the upcoming user airdrop could happen ahead of the token generation event expected by December 31. The first season of the Season 1 points program ended with the final private beta distribution on September 30. Season 2 points were distributed every Friday, earned by running organic trading strategies via the user interface and application programming interface. It has also ended, and the points have been distributed. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

It is essential to run fair and reasonable upside models, and this explains why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is steadily making such headway as an Ethereum-focused DeFi cryptocurrency that traders can invest in. At the current presale price of $0.035, it would be possible to accumulate around 28,571 units of the MUTM cryptocurrency with a mere $1,000, If the anticipated $1 price milestone is reached in 2026, this translates to nearly 29x returns, an upside that is simply unimaginable in large-cap markets. This euphoria is being precipitated by an excellent presale that has seen the project now in its 6th stage and 99% sold out, establishing immense urgency in terms of traders seeking to acquire this particular cryptocurrency prior to the next price hurdle. Apart from the upside potential, the winning formula in MUTM lies in the real-world utility that it derives as an Ethereum-focused decentralized lending and borrowing system, meaning that there exists intrinsic usage, rather than an asset simply based on speculation. Phase 6 Almost Full, Secure MUTM Before Price Increase Mutuum Finance started its presale in early 2025 at a token price of $0.01, but currently, the token is at a value of $0.035, resulting in a 250% growth in its value with no exchange listing yet. This indicates a significant interest in the market as well as utility in the token, MUTM. Phase 6 has surpassed the 95% mark in sales, leaving very few tokens left at this current price point. Investors wanting a piece of the action before the launch price of $0.06 are taking immediate action. To incentivize people even further to take an active part in this project, Mutuum Finance introduced a new leaderboard that changes every 24 hours and awards the person who made the most significant investment with $500 of MUTM tokens. Key Milestones Mutuum Finance is on the threshold of a major development phase with V1 launch on Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025, including: Lending & borrowing infrastructure mtTokens Debt token system Liquidation bot At first, the tokens that will be supported include ETH and USDT. Most of the tokens that are in the initial stage of development are released without the product working. However, Mutuum Finance has developed their product completely before launch. It is among the next-big-cryptos that can be invested in. Currently, the project is at Phase 2 of the development cycle, working on smart contract optimizations and being prepared for multi-stage testing. As the team prepares for Version 1 and security audits continue, the pace of progress continues to be swift and very promising. Urgency Peaks as Phase 6 Closes With over 99% allocated for Phase 6, the tokens at $0.035 are dwindling quickly. The weekly jumps in membership are fueling the need for new entrants to secure their tokens before Phase 7. Whale activity has also escalated, with an acceleration of allocations and a message being sent to small investors that it is time to take action. As soon as Phase 6 closes, the presale enters a stage closer to the launch valuation level. For investors looking for the most suitable cryptocurrency to purchase before the end of 2026, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as the most promising Ethereum-based DeFi project that offers huge potential. At the current presale price of $0.035, an initial investment of $1,000 will yield 28,571 units of the MUTM cryptocurrency. Then, if the cryptocurrency attains a value of $1 by the end of 2026, the initial investment could balloon to nearly $29,000. Given that Phase 6 is over 99% sold out and that the V1 Testnet is about to be launched, investors who purchase the cryptocurrency early will stand to gain from utilizing the services provided by the cryptocurrency and the presale’s growth structure. In fact, the time frame for buying the cryptocurrency at a discount will soon be closing as Phase 7 will begin at a higher price of $0.04.

The year marked a clear break from earlier caution, with national reserves, energy strategies, and regulatory systems reshaped around crypto’s growing role in public finance. Governments Move From Sidelines to State Strategy CoinMarketCap shared a series of policy moves in posts published on X on December 25, showing how crypto adoption changed tone this year, moving away from retail trading and toward government execution. First off was the confirmation by the United States of the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the halting of automatic sales of seized BTC, quietly shifting the flagship cryptocurrency from a confiscated asset into a long-term treasury holding. The move, carried out by executive agencies rather than lawmakers, sent a strong signal that Bitcoin now sits within federal balance sheet planning. In the Middle East, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) completed and enforced wide-ranging crypto rules through Dubai’s VARA and Abu Dhabi’s ADGM. Major exchanges and custody firms expanded operations there, drawn by regulatory clarity rather than price excitement. The framework has since become a reference point for other jurisdictions seeking stability over short-term gains. On its part, Latin America saw a more nuanced recalibration. El Salvador ended Bitcoin’s legal-tender requirement following talks with the International Monetary Fund but kept its national BTC holdings intact. That shift did not mean an exit. Last month, during a sharp market pullback, the country bought more than 1,000 BTC worth about $100 million, lifting total holdings to roughly 7,500 BTC, according to its Bitcoin Office. Essentially, the policy focus moved from ideology to budget discipline, while the balance sheet exposure remained. Meanwhile, Pakistan took a different route by linking crypto to energy planning. The government set aside 2,000 megawatts of surplus power for Bitcoin mining and AI data centers and entered talks with Binance tied to a possible $2 billion investment. Mining was framed as a way to convert unused electricity into industrial output. Central Banks Test Boundaries as Regulation Tightens Europe and Brazil added further depth to the shift in 2025. For example, the Czech National Bank launched a small Bitcoin purchase pilot and, in July, disclosed an $18 million stake in Coinbase shares, marking its first public step into crypto-linked assets. While limited in size, the move lowered a long-standing barrier for developed-market central banks. Brazil focused on structure rather than reserves, with the country rolling out licensing rules for crypto firms and pulling stablecoin flows under foreign exchange oversight. That approach builds on earlier steps, including the approval of a spot XRP ETF in December 2024, which helped channel institutional demand into regulated markets. Taken together, these actions show that 2025 was less about enthusiasm and more about decisions. Some governments tightened controls, others committed capital, and a few blended crypto into energy and financial planning.

XRP, unlike many other digital assets, operates primarily as an institutional settlement layer , designed to handle massive transaction volumes that far exceed typical spot market activity. Understanding this context is key to appreciating why conventional price limits may not apply. Stern Drew recently argued on X that dismissing XRP’s potential for high valuations overlooks its purpose. Drew says XRP was built for institutional-grade settlement, not retail trades, changing how we should value it. XRP’s Role in Institutional Settlement Central to this argument is the real-world application of XRP in global payments. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product enables institutions to source liquidity instantly across borders, bypassing the delays and costs of traditional systems such as SWIFT. People saying $XRP can’t go past $10,000 are missing the scale entirely. One Ripple partner moves more value in a single day than Bitcoin settles in a year. XRP was built to settle institutional volume, not retail trades. At that scale, low prices make no sense. High prices… — Stern Drew (@SternDrewCrypto) December 26, 2025 ODL now operates across major remittance corridors, processing billions in daily transaction volume. In fact, some Ripple partners settle more value in a single day than Bitcoin handles in an entire year. This scale underscores why XRP’s pricing dynamics are unlike those of retail-oriented tokens. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) facilitates these transfers with near-instant finality , low fees, and deterministic settlement, making it uniquely suited for large-scale liquidity deployment. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, whose throughput and confirmation times can bottleneck institutional use, XRP was engineered to meet operational demands that prioritize speed, compliance, and efficiency. Different Math for High-Volume Assets Stern Drew highlights that traditional price thinking fails when applied to assets serving as infrastructure for trillions in financial flows. Low prices can hinder settlement efficiency by requiring more units to move equivalent value, while higher prices can streamline liquidity management for institutions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This framework reframes valuation from speculative demand to functional utility, emphasizing operational efficiency over market hype. Adoption and Market Implications Institutional integration also shifts the perception of supply and demand. As more corridors adopt XRP for liquidity, locked or actively used XRP becomes a structural component of global payments. This situation makes conventional retail price ceilings irrelevant – the asset’s value depends on its usefulness in moving capital, not daily trading sentiment. Skeptics who peg XRP’s ceiling to historical performance overlook the transformational scale of its application. XRP is not competing on narrative or retail popularity—it operates in a different league, serving the foundational infrastructure of cross-border finance. As Stern Drew notes, ignoring this scale leads to underestimating what XRP can achieve both in utility and, potentially, in valuation.

The law set the first federal framework for stablecoins after months of negotiation. Armstrong has framed the renewed push to revise it as a direct challenge to competition in U.S. financial markets. He has argued that the debate no longer centers on safety. Instead, it reflects a struggle over who controls access to yield in a modern payments system. Consequently, the next phase of the fight could shape how innovation survives inside U.S. regulation. Coinbase Pushes Back on Renewed Lobbying Armstrong has said Coinbase will oppose any effort to reopen the GENIUS Act. He views the law as settled policy. Besides that, he has stressed that reopening compromises legislative credibility. Lawmakers already agreed that stablecoin issuers cannot pay interest directly. However, platforms and third parties can still offer rewards. That compromise balanced innovation with oversight. Hence, changing it now risks tilting the field toward entrenched players. He has also warned that repeated lobbying campaigns weaken trust in rulemaking. According to Armstrong, reopening settled frameworks invites incumbents to delay competition through political pressure. Moreover, he has linked this pattern to broader fintech concerns. Other technology firms watch closely to see whether U.S. legislation holds after passage. Banking Economics Under Scrutiny Max Avery, a board member at Digital Ascension Group, has added economic context to the debate. He has pointed out that banks currently earn about 4.4% on reserves held at the Federal Reserve. In contrast, many savings accounts still pay roughly 0.01%. Additionally, he has argued that this spread explains resistance to stablecoin rewards. Banks typically take deposits and place them at the Federal Reserve. They earn more than 4% in interest. Consequently, customers receive minimal returns. Avery has noted that stablecoin platforms attempt to share part of this yield with users. That effort now faces political resistance. Significantly, independent research has shown no evidence of unusual deposit losses at community banks. What Lawmakers and Markets May Watch Armstrong and Avery have both urged attention to how amendments take shape. Broad bans on rewards could restrict competition without improving safety. Moreover, scrutiny may fall on who funds campaigns framed as community bank protection. In many cases, large institutions benefit most. The debate also raises questions about consistency in policymaking. Few lawmakers have pressed banks on stagnant savings rates over the past 15 years. Meanwhile, stablecoins face heightened concern over modest rewards. Consequently, the outcome may signal whether U.S. policy favors competitive payments infrastructure or protected banking margins. Over the next six months, the GENIUS Act could become a test case. Its fate may influence how innovation, yield, and consumer choice evolve in the United States.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-27 18:20:06

This New Crypto Is Up 250% With Only 1% Phase 6 Supply Remaining,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/final-chance-under-0-04-this-new-crypto-is-up-250-with-only-1-phase-6-supply-remaining/,"Other crypto projects do their largest moves under the radar. Progress stacks up first. Attention follows later. Markets are quick to react to situations when supply reduces with infrastructure forming simultaneously. According to the market commentators, this is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is entering the market now, with timing beginning to be a significant factor. The Design of How Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Works Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized finance that is based on lending and borrowing. It was designed to be used in the real world, not toward short-run trading. On the pool based side, users deposit their assets in common liquidity pools. They in turn get mtTokens. Such mtTokens symbolize their commitment in the pool and accrue APY as borrowers pay interest. As an illustration, providing USDT will produce the minting of mtTokens that will gain value with the rise in demand for borrowing. Activity is directly related to yield. Peer-to-peer borrowing is also facilitated by Mutuum Finance. Borrowers open overcollateralized loans and make interests depending on the market conditions. Loan to Value ratios are subject to asset risk. Greater LTVs are available on more stable assets, whereas volatile tokens are limited. Liquidations are initiated in case of collateral loss to more than the liquidation level in an effort to secure the liquidity providers. Interest rates change according to usage. During the time of high liquidity, the rates remain low and communicate borrowing. In case of tight liquidity, rates increase and invite lenders and decrease debts. This is the balance that Mutuum Finance is focused on when it comes to capital flow. Presale Progress and What the Numbers Show MUTM pre-sale started in early 2025. Since phase 1, the token has improved approximately 250%, shifting away, at the moment, at $0.01 to the current price of $0.035. The official launch price is set at $0.06 and early phase participants would be in a good position to be when this price level is reached. Up to this point, approximately $19.45M has been raised. This project has increased to approximately 18,650 holders. Among a given amount of supply 4B tokens, an estimated amount of 45.5% is distributed to the presale. That equals roughly 1.82B tokens. Phase 6 is now over 99% allocated. The bulk of the supply that exists at this price has been given out. The number of tokens sold has been growing steadily and not surging, and this is an indicator that early investors were used to seeing such growth. The platform also has a 24 hour leaderboard which rewards the most active contributor of the day with $500 in MUTM. This characteristic will promote a regular attendance as opposed to a single attendance that would aid in distribution smoothness. As phase allocation is almost over and the second phase is expected to have a price increase of approximately 20%, people have now changed to focus on current availability as opposed to future speculation. V1 Launch and V1 Security As stated on the Mutuum Finance X account , version V1 of the lending and borrowing protocol will be developed to be used in the Sepolia testnet during Q4 2025. It consists of liquidity pools, the use of mtTokens and debt tokens and an automated liquidator bot, with ETH and USDT as the first supported assets. There are security reviews that are already in place. Mutuum Finance is rated at 90 out of 100 in a CertiK token scan. Simultaneously, Halborn Security is revising the lending and borrowing agreements. Code is completed and in the form of analysis. There is additional code testing of a $50k bug bounty program. A few analysts hold that V1 will also be able to be launched when its usage is experienced and MUTM is likely to rise over the $0.06 launch price. This could result in a bullish response up to 3x-5x possible range of current levels given participation changing the expectations to activity. Why Stablecoin and Layer 2 are Important Mutuum Finance intends on launching an overcollateralized stablecoin. The utilization of stablecoins in lending platforms is important as it helps decrease volatility and adopt predictable borrowing and repayment patterns. This may enhance daily usage particularly during periods of uncertainty in the market. The roadmap is also concerned with Layer 2 expansion. A reduction in fees and the rate of transactions makes smaller positions suited. This enables access and helps to facilitate better transaction volume without congestions. These in combination with a strong oracle infrastructure, with the expected Chainlink data feeds and fallback pricing solutions, will contribute to realistic valuations and secure liquidations. To people currently observing crypto prices, and tracking new crypto projects with their product utility growth, Mutuum Finance is at a phase where supply, form, and timing are coming into harmony. Phase 6 is nearly complete. There is proximity of infrastructure to activation. It is a combination in which price behavior tends to begin to change.

Among these investors is a certain cohort, its short-term holders (STHs), who have been facing heat over an extended period. STH MVRV In Deep Red For 60 Consecutive Days In a recent post on the X platform, market quant Burak Kesmeci revealed an interesting perspective regarding the current market condition for Bitcoin’s most reactive investors — the short-term holders. Kesmeci’s post revolves around the STH MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) metric. For context, this metric compares the market value of BTC to its realized value, thus serving as a means to track whether Bitcoin’s short-term investors are, on average, in profit or at a loss. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Go Quiet On Binance As Inflows Collapse: Supply Shock Setup? A reading less than the neutral “1” level typically indicates that the STHs are in the red. Depending on the depth of this value, it could also foreshadow capitulation events. On the other hand, values above 1 reveal that short-term investors are in profit. The higher the value, the more probable it is for profit-taking events to follow. In his post on X, the online pundit shared that the STH MVRV has been in deep red territory for a full period of 60 days. Kesmeci explained that the flagship cryptocurrency’s short-term investors are now facing the highest level of “patience test” that they have ever witnessed throughout 2025. Notably, prolonged periods of negative MVRV readings have often correlated with heightened market stress. Seeing as the market’s most-reactive investor cohort is the one concerned, the Bitcoin price could witness the effect of capitulation-driven sell-offs. However, the opposite is also possible. In the scenario where bearish pressure eases off completely, prolonged negative readings could be a sign of imminent market stabilization. Bitcoin Stays Beneath 111-Day SMA — What This Means For Price To lend more weight to his on-chain revelation, Kesmeci also followed up with a key technical observation of Bitcoin’s price action. According to the analyst, Bitcoin has been trading below the 111-day simple moving average (SMA 111) within the same period. This alignment between on-chain and technical analysis thus functions to reinforce a clear narrative; Bitcoin is either currently at a consolidatory or corrective phase. This is contrary to the belief that the premier cryptocurrency might be at the start of a significant upward trend.

Macro events, alongside renewed spot demand, could prove pivotal for the cryptocurrency in the future.

As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at around $87,380, with no significant movement in the past day.

Uniswap price analysis on the daily time frame The one-day price chart for Uniswap confirms an upward trend in the market. The UNI/USD pair is hovering near the $5.96 level as the bullish trend returns. The bullish push has significantly increased the price, as green candlesticks on the chart signify buying momentum. The distance between the Bollinger Bands highlights the intensity of volatility. This distance is slowly widening, leading to increased volatility. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $6.32, whereby its lower limit, indicating support, has moved to $4.86. UNI/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is trending in the neutral region. The indicator’s value was recorded at 53 today. The upward curve on the RSI signifies a bullish trend, and more stability can be expected if the buying momentum intensifies and the indicator’s score increases further. Uniswap price analysis on the 4-hour chart The four-hour chart analysis of Uniswap also shows buying momentum, as the price is increasing again. This is evidenced by its price recovering to $5.96 over the past four hours; it may increase further in the coming hours if traders continue buying more. Moreover, decreasing volatility signifies a lower chance of a reversal or higher price oscillation. The Bollinger Bands are covering less area, leading to a low level of volatility. This low volatility signals greater market predictability. The upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $6.02, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $5.71, establishing the support point. UNI/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator’s value increased to 56 over the past few hours, with its curve pointing upward; however, the indicator is still trending in the neutral region. This condition suggests buying interest at the current price level on the four-hour chart. Further appreciation in the coin’s value is possible if the buying momentum continues for the next few hours.

Uniswap price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market trends, as the coin’s price is increasing after a bullish trend observed over the current trading session. If buyers hold the ongoing momentum, UNI’s price might increase to the $6 range. Is Uniswap a good investment? Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with massive potential. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $22.26 level by 2027 and above $45.69 by 2031. Why is UNI up? The broader crypto market is experiencing positive market sentiment today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are gaining, and so is UNI. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2025? The maximum UNI can reach in 2025 is $10.54, while the average price is expected to be around $8.79. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading just below the $6 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $6.27 and $7.8; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2027, which is quite higher than its current value, making it a good option to buy UNI tokens. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high, which is not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. However, this is not investment advice, and one should seek independent professional consultation before making any investment decision. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it’s worth waiting, as the coin’s value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI’s price to reach $45.69 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price. Recent news/opinions on Uniswap Network As reported by Cryptopolitan , Uniswap founder Hayden Adams alleges that Citadel’s Ken Griffin is pushing the SEC to regulate DeFi developers as though they were traditional financial intermediaries. His claims surface as SEC actions against platforms like Rari Capital intensify scrutiny of the sector, with Adams pointing to what he describes as Citadel’s long-standing opposition to DeFi initiatives.

It quickly rose to $7.00 before reaching an all-time low of $1.03 (CoinGecko) or $0.4190 (CoinMarketCap) on the same day. UNI ended the year at $5.00 after a gradual recovery during the 2020 bull run. In 2021, UNI surged 400% in January to $20. By March, it hit $28; on May 3, it reached an all-time high (ATH) of $44.93, skyrocketing its market capitalization. It ended the year near $18 after a significant decline. Throughout 2022, UNI continued to decline as the cryptocurrency prices kept falling, dropping to around $5.5 by June as the bearish trend persisted. The crypto market rebounded in 2023, and UNI saw bullish momentum, peaking at $7.77 on December 28. UNI began 2024 on a downtrend, briefly recovering to $15 by March 6. After mid-May, it faced selling pressure, falling to $0.14 by July 31, as UNI holders kept selling assets. It stabilized in August at around $5 and traded above $6 at the start of September. In October, UNI reached a peak of $8, and November saw a peak price of $13.58. In December, UNI soared to $18.60. In February 2025, Uniswap was trading near $12, which was below January price levels of $15.

However, some bullish price action was observed in May, when UNI jumped to $7.5 and finally peaked at $11.74 in July. August proved a bullish month as UNI/USD reached a yearly high price of $12.31, while it remained in a downtrend in September and October. UNI traded near the $5.7 mark in early November. After surging toward $10 in mid-November, the price of UNI declined again toward $5.5 in early December.",Crypto Price Predictions|Uniswap,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|UNI|ARB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-27 18:45:45

The team behind the bot has since responded, promising refunds while assuring the core architecture was not affected. DeBot plans refund after major hack According to on-chain data, the hackers got away with about $255,000 in assets, consolidated to some addresses on BSC, with some funds funneled to Tornado Cash , where they were laundered. The founder of the SlowMist blockchain security outfit has claimed that the risk addresses are still vulnerable. He advised anyone with assets on them to move them. The DeBot team has also responded to the crisis with posts on X containing updates as well as plans for moving forward. According to one post, the DeBot secure wallet addresses are operating normally and were not affected in any way. The team acknowledged that there were relevant situations with some addresses, but that they are following up and handling them properly. For those worried about their assets, the team encouraged them to transfer said assets from their respective risk wallets to the secure wallet address. Additionally, the team has promised that all users who were affected by the hack will receive full compensation following a comprehensive review and tally. According to them, the hack only affected wallets imported or generated before December 10. They claim addresses that were generated or imported after December 10 are all secure wallets and unaffected, and they are working without a hitch. Trust Wallet suffered a similar issue Users of DeBot who were affected by the hack claimed that their assets were transferred out of their wallets. Those statements are reminiscent of the accounts given by victims of the Trust wallet hack, which saw the hacker get away with up to $7 million, as reported by Cryptopolitan. The theft of funds occurred shortly after the Binance-linked Trust Wallet released an updated version of its extension for the Chrome web browser. The breach was flagged on December 25 by on-chain detective ZachXBT and has since been confirmed by the wallet team. “Community alert: A number of Trust Wallet users have reported that funds were drained from wallet addresses within the past couple hours,” ZachXBT posted on Telegram. “While the exact root cause has not been determined coincidentally the Trust Wallet Chrome extension pushed a new update yesterday.” The breach targeted version 2.68 of Trust Wallet’s browser extension, according to what the wallet team posted on X. The team also urged users not to open that version and to upgrade to version 2.69. “Mobile-only users and all other browser extension versions are not impacted,” they claimed. Like DeBot, there is a promise to reimburse the stolen funds according to Changpeng Zhao, a co-founder of Binance. Both exploits, which happened within close proximity to each other, targeted crypto wallets and have highlighted the importance of constant vigilance from all parties because the hackers are not taking any breaks. Crypto theft has already risen to $6.75 billion this year, according to a Chainalysis report. The number of personal wallet compromises has also surged to 158,000 from 64,000 last year, though the amount stolen accounted for 20% of the total, down from 44%.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-xrp-will-bounce-hard-heres-why/,"Sharp price declines often trigger panic in crypto markets, but for seasoned analysts, they can also signal high-probability reversal zones. XRP’s recent pullback is a prime example of this dynamic, with technical and fundamental factors combining to create the conditions for a potential rebound. Understanding these signals requires looking beyond short-term volatility and analyzing both chart patterns and underlying adoption trends. A recent post by STEPH IS CRYPTO on X highlighted a bullish perspective on XRP’s current setup. Steph noted that XRP’s dip to around $1.81 on Bitstamp aligns with a key trendline support, suggesting the asset may be poised for a sharp bounce into 2026. This insight points to a convergence of technical support and market psychology, which often precedes meaningful upward movement. $XRP will bounce hard! pic.twitter.com/iVBN6r2qoV — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 26, 2025 Technical Analysis: Support and Reversal Potential XRP has faced a challenging 2025, declining roughly 25 % year-to-date amid broader Q4 selloffs and risk-off behavior across crypto markets. As of report time, XRP is trading near $1.84, sitting below key short-term moving averages such as the 20-day and 50-day. While this generally signals bearish bias, Steph highlighted that the trendline support indicates buyers are stepping in at these levels. Indicators like the MACD histogram and oversold conditions on the daily and three-day charts further suggest that selling pressure may be exhausting. Historically, when XRP tests these support zones, even modest inflows can trigger rapid rebounds, as short-term sentiment shifts and traders re-enter positions. Market Fundamentals Supporting XRP Beyond technicals, broader fundamentals reinforce the bullish case. Ripple’s legal resolution with the U.S. SEC in 2025 removed a major regulatory overhang, opening doors for renewed institutional interest. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This includes potential adoption of XRP in cross-border payment corridors and the continued expansion of On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), which processes billions of transactions daily. Such real-world utility strengthens XRP’s value proposition, providing a floor for price action amid market turbulence. Market Psychology and Institutional Flows The psychology of support levels also plays a critical role. Trendline touches and historical consolidation zones create narratives of resilience, attracting contrarian buyers who view dips as entry opportunities. Coupled with the influx of institutional flows and adoption metrics, these patterns can create the conditions for a swift and sustained rebound. Outlook for 2026 Combining technical setups, market psychology, and fundamental adoption, the case for an XRP bounce is compelling. If the current trendline support holds and institutional interest continues to grow, XRP could recover sharply from its recent lows. While short-term volatility may persist, the convergence of these factors points toward potential upside as the market enters 2026.

The meme coin sector momentarily slowed down, hinting at a potential rally if the broader market stabilizes after its recent downturn. Specifically, PEPE coin prices display a bullish pattern, presenting an opportunity for a breakout based on the daily chart analysis. Moreover, the volatility of meme coins is exacerbated by the prevailing market uncertainty. This causes fluctuations in PEPE prices as they oscillate in search of a solid support level to initiate a recovery. Considering investing in Pepe crypto?

Pepeusd Chart By TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.00000384, beginning a bearish trend to $0.00000365. Is PEPE A Good Investment? Reviewing the Pepe project’s roadmap, it appears there are no detailed plans other than anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project’s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe’s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2025 could propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Why is Pepe up today? Pepe’s price faced minor buying around recent lows. This pushed the price of PEPE toward the intra high around $0.000004. Will Pepe Recover? If buyers hold the price above the $0.000004 level strongly, we might see further upward rally in the Pepe price chart. What is Pepe price prediction for 2025? The Pepe price prediction for 2025 expects the meme coin to record a maximum level of $0.000035. Will Pepe price reach $0.01? Pepe’s price might touch the $0.01 mark by the end of 2029. However, this price milestone entirely depends on the utility of Pepe coin and future buying demand. Will Pepe price reach $1? Pepe has a great community, and the hype is high for the meme coin. If everything remains good, we might see Pepe’s price touch $1 soon or by 2040. Recent news Blockchain analysis from Bubblemaps indicates that nearly one-third of Pepe’s initial token supply was controlled by a single wallet, contradicting the project’s “for the people” launch narrative. The cluster allegedly sold $2 million in PEPE the day after launch, creating sell pressure that analysts say hindered the token’s early growth. this is $PEPE at launch with time nodes on 30% bundled you were lied to https://t.co/Fsv4hXdurj pic.twitter.com/ha8pHXcss9 — Bubblemaps (@bubblemaps) December 10, 2025 PEPE Price Prediction December 2025 If BTC price records robust surges this month, we might see PEPE price skyrocketing. We expect the PEPE price to record minimum and maximum prices of $0.000004 and $0.000017, respectively. The average price might be around $0.00001. Month Potential low ($) Potential average ($) Potential high ($) December 2025 0.000004 0.00001 0.000017 Pepe price prediction 2025 The Pepe roadmap is somewhat vague, with few definitive plans beyond the expectation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate the market. Despite its robust community, this lack of clear direction might cap the project’s price potential. Meme coins have a reputation for offering significant financial returns, as their values can surge rapidly when supported by their communities. The impact of major announcements was evident when Pepe’s value soared by more than 222% following its listing on the Binance exchange, reaching an all-time high. A similar event in 2025 could potentially send Pepe to new peaks. In 2025, Pepe’s minimum expected price is projected to be $0.000004. It may peak at a maximum value of $0.000035, with an average trading price of $0.000027 throughout the year.

For instance, Shiba Inu is developing Shibarium, a layer-two scaling solution on Ethereum , alongside various protocols and tools for its community. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is enhancing tools and libraries that facilitate the integration of $DOGE as a payment option for businesses. According to predictions and technical analysis, Pepe could achieve a minimum price of $0.0048 in 2026. The price may rise to a maximum of $0.0058, with an average expected trading price of $0.0050.

According to Galaxy research associate Lucas Tcheyan, the latest proposal, SIMD-0411, will likely be withdrawn without a vote. The assessment reflects broader frustration inside the Solana community, where debates around token inflation have struggled to reach consensus. Consequently, attention is shifting toward other priorities that developers and validators consider more urgent for the network’s growth. The inflation discussion has lingered since last year, creating repeated governance friction. However, participants increasingly argue that prolonged debate diverts focus from structural improvements. These include market microstructure changes that directly affect liquidity, execution quality, and onchain efficiency. Hence, Solana’s leadership appears more inclined to pause contentious monetary changes rather than force an unresolved vote. Market Structure Takes Priority Over Token Economics Solana contributors now emphasize infrastructure upgrades instead of altering inflation mechanics. Tcheyan noted that unresolved inflation proposals risk distracting builders from implementing practical changes that improve trading conditions. Moreover, concerns persist that adjusting SOL’s issuance model could affect its perception as a neutral monetary asset. That risk weighs heavily as institutional interest in layer-1 networks grows. Besides governance considerations, Solana’s onchain economy continues to mature. Galaxy expects Internet Capital Markets built on Solana to reach a $2 billion valuation, up from roughly $750 million today. This growth reflects a transition away from meme-driven speculation toward applications with measurable revenue. Consequently, demand increasingly favors tokens linked to sustainable businesses rather than short-term narratives. Broader Crypto Outlook Shapes Solana’s Path Galaxy’s outlook arrives alongside cautious expectations for the wider crypto market in 2026. Bitcoin volatility has compressed, while derivatives markets now price downside risk more aggressively than upside. However, analysts still expect Bitcoin to reach $250,000 by the end of 2027. Additionally, institutional access continues expanding as macro conditions gradually ease. Within that environment, Solana’s strategy appears defensive but deliberate. By delaying inflation changes, the network avoids uncertainty that could unsettle long-term holders. Moreover, developers gain space to strengthen execution layers and application economics. This approach aligns with a broader industry trend where value capture shifts toward applications instead of base layers. Solana Price Action Reflects Near-Term Tension Despite governance uncertainty, Solana’s price increased modestly today. SOL traded near $123 , posting a small daily gain but remaining lower over the past week.

Below is how much was traded in the ETH derivatives market in the past year. Ethereum Futures Trading Hits New Yearly Record In a December 26 post on social media platform X, pseudonymous analyst Darkfost revealed that Ethereum stood out in one regard despite the mixed performance of altcoins in 2025. Darkfost highlighted that derivatives trading volumes continued to dominate the entire crypto market this year. However, Ethereum recorded increased activity in the derivative markets in 2025, setting a new record in terms of futures trading for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. As expected, Binance remained the dominant platform in terms of derivatives trading volume, with its figure further putting things into perspective. According to data highlighted by Darkfost, over $6.74 trillion in ETH futures volume was traded on Binance in the past year, almost double that of 2024, which was already a historical record. However, this trend was not limited to Binance, as other major exchanges also observed a similar phenomenon. Breaking things down, OKX saw a new record of $4.28 trillion, while Bybit registered $2.15 trillion, and Bitget recorded $1.95T in ETH futures volume. Darkfost concluded: All major exchanges therefore converge toward the same conclusion. Ethereum was one of the most traded assets in the world on derivative markets in 2025, highlighting just how strong speculative appetite has been. What Derivatives Market Dominance Means For Price? Going further, Darkfost put into perspective the magnitude of futures dominance in the market over the past year. The on-chain analyst revealed that ETH saw $5 in futures trading for every dollar in spot trading, an annual record in the derivatives market. As observed in the chart above, a spot-to-futures ratio around 0.2 over the year reflects a market heavily tilted toward leverage. According to Darkfost, this trend explains the extreme speculation witnessed in the Ethereum market throughout 2025. Darkfost noted that a market primarily driven by derivatives tends to be more unstable and less predictable. “Movements tend to be amplified, disorderly, and highly dependent on liquidations, ultimately allowing ETH to register only a marginal new all-time high by just a handful of dollars,” the analyst added. As of this writing, the price of ETH stands at around $2,932, reflecting an over 1% decline in the past 24 hours. After a mixed performance this year, the altcoin is currently down from its all-time high by more than 40%.",Ethereum|ETH|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-27 19:30:32

Positioning has occurred even before attention has become rampant. The market commentators believe that now is that moment of lateness of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in which allocation only narrows as visibility begins to increase. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale News Mutuum Finance is now valued at $0.035. The presale started at the start of 2025 and has gone through stages, which were organized with advances in the price. Since the price of the token at the first stage was $0.01, it has increased approximately 250% to its present price. The launch price is set to be $0.06. To date, the project has accumulated nearly $19.45M in funds, as well as creating an approximate 18,650-base of holders. Nominated by a fixed number of 4B MUTM tokens, the presale is about 45.5%, and this constitutes approximately 1.82B tokens. Phase 6 is now over 99% allocated. That is, the bulk of the preliminary supply is sold off. Tokens have not been pouring out in a spurt. Rather, allocation went in a steady manner over milestones. Early investor behavior tends to follow the trend of accumulation as opposed to excitement in the short term. Since Phase 6 has become near completion, all the remaining supply has become the focal point but not the early pricing itself. What is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Building Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a DeFi lending protocol that is being designed on top of two lending markets. The idea is to establish a continuity instead of a one time affair. At the supply side, users place their assets in liquidity pools and get mtTokens. These mtTokens are a reflection of their pool and they receive yield as the borrowers pay interest. The growth in yield is proportional to the increase in the borrowing demand, and this relates the returns to the activity of protocols directly. Security is a core focus. Mutuum Finance has successfully passed a CertiK scan with 90 out of 100. Moreover, Halborn security is examining the lending and borrowing agreements. Code is complete and under serious examination, and a bug bounty in the form of $50k is active to get additional verification. Stablecoin, Oracles and the Price Outlook Mutuum Finance will be launching an overcollateralized stable coin according to the official roadmap. Stablecoins play a crucial role in lending platforms since they alleviate volatility risk, as well allowing borrowing and repayment patterns to be predictable. This has the ability to boost daily consumption particularly in times when markets are shut down. It is also foreseen in the protocol to make use of strong oracle infrastructure. Chainlink data feeds, fallback pricing systems, and aggregated sources would be adequate to provide accurate prices on assets. Sound oracles are essential to safe liquidations and reasonable loan arrangements. Given these structural components, a number of analysts think that MUTM can make a multi-x move following the launch assuming that usage will increase as anticipated. Towards the bullish case, there is a position of a 5x to 10x potential between the present figures due to the efforts in participation rather than a speculative trading. These estimates are associated with behavior change. With the shift of users away from holding to active lending and borrowing, the dynamics of demand change. The Whales and The Importance of Timing As it is written in official announcements by the Mutuum Finance X account, V1 of the lending and borrowing protocol will be deployed to Sepolia as part of the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. The main characteristics are the liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot. The initial supported token is ETH and USDT. With the tightening of Phase 6, six figure whale allocations have begun to be reported. Bigger purchasers tend to seek confirmation at the end-stage before investing. Their involvement may also lower supply in the market even more and alter the short term behavior of the market. The presale is also accompanied by the 24 hour leaderboard which gives the best daily contributor $500 in MUTM. This will promote regularly attended engagements as opposed to occasional entries to ensure consistent flow of allocations. As Phase 6 is almost finished and V1 is in sight, commentators in the market speculate that it is at this stage that positioning is replaced by visibility. In the list of what crypto to invest in before utility goes live, Mutuum Finance is gaining a growing place, probably because of its increasing discussion in the industry alongside the question of which crypto to scan today.

On-chain data now shows a notable deterioration in profitability across the network, with the share of ETH supply sitting in profit falling below 60%. At the same time, institutional demand has decreased, with data from Glassnode showing how both retail profitability and institutional participation in Ethereum have weakened simultaneously. Related Reading: Could XRP Make Trillionaires? Tech Firm Founder Thinks It’s Possible Ethereum’s Percent Supply In Profit Falls Below 60% The drop in Ethereum’s percent supply in profit has been one of the clearest signals of stress for Ethereum. Ethereum’s investors have fallen into deeper losses, and this is a reflection of recent price action. Speaking of price action, Ethereum had initially reclaimed the $3,000 price level on December 22. During this time, the percentage of ETH supply in profit pushed back above 60% and reached as high as 63%. However, this break was for only a very brief time, and price action fell back below $3,000 after just a few hours. As ETH broke below $3,000 again, the share of supply held at unrealized gains fell under 60%, down from above 70% earlier in December. This fall shows that the pullback has not been limited to recent buyers but has begun to impact investors who accumulated during the beginning of the month. ETH Percent Supply In Profit. Source: Glassnode ETF Net Outflows Indicate Waning Institutional Participation The weakness in on-chain profitability and price action is also a reflection of trends in the ETF market. Another data metric from Glassnode shows that since early November, the 30-day moving average of net flows into US Spot Ethereum ETFs has turned negative and remained there. This persistence of outflows points to a phase of muted participation and disengagement from institutional traders. The ETF chart below shows that inflows, which supported Ethereum’s push to new all-time highs in August, have faded, replaced by continued outflows through November and December. This matters for price action because ETF demand has been a key source of incremental buying. As that bid has weakened, Ethereum has struggled to absorb sell-side pressure, contributing to its failure to hold above $3,000. ETH: US Spot ETF Net Flows. Source: Glassnode The combination of negative ETF net flows and Ethereum’s recent price behaviorhelps explain rising unrealized losses. Interestingly, various on-chain data sources also reveal different instances of whale addresses reducing their exposure to Ethereum outside of spot ETFs. For instance, Lookonchain recently highlighted activity from a wallet believed to be linked to Erik Voorhees, which swapped 4,619 ETH, valued at about $13.42 million, into Bitcoin Cash (BCH) over the past two weeks after having been inactive for nearly nine years. Voorhees later responded by clarifying that the wallet does not belong to him and that he does not hold any Bitcoin Cash. Related Reading: Ethereum’s 2026 Overhaul Aims To Cut Costs, Boost Speed, Limit Censorship Lookonchain also pointed to selling pressure from Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, who has offloaded a total of 1,871 ETH at about $5.53 million in the past week.

But a new report suggests that their popularity failed to translate into performance. This could mean that the frenzy for purely speculative crypto may be subsiding, especially as investors grow cautious amid a choppy Q4. Weak Performance Across Meme Coin and AI According to CoinGecko’s latest report, despite ranking as the most followed narratives this year, meme coins and AI tokens delivered average year-to-date losses of -31.6% and -50.2%, respectively. Most of the largest meme coins declined between 44.6% and 82.5% YTD, with Ribbita by Virtuals standing out as the lone exception. A similar pattern played out across AI crypto as well, where only Alchemist AI and Kite avoided steep drawdowns, while the rest of the sector fell between 49.8% and 84.3%. Beyond meme coins and AI, other widely followed narratives also struggled, which was indicative of how uneven 2025 has been across the market. DeFi posted average losses of -34.8%, and roughly matched meme coin performance. Meanwhile, decentralized exchange (DEX) tokens declined 55.5% and closely mirrored the AI narrative’s downturn. Layer 2s continued to disappoint for a second straight year, after recording average losses of -40.6% YTD, despite their long-term role in scaling Ethereum and other networks. RWA and Layer 1 Outperform In contrast to these laggards, real-world assets (RWA) emerged as the most profitable crypto narrative of 2025. This cohort delivered average gains of 185.8% YTD across its largest tokens, and this outperformance was driven primarily by Keeta Network’s explosive 1,794.9% rally, alongside strong gains from Zebec Network and Maple Finance. However, overall returns were still far below last year’s 819.5% surge. Layer 1s ranked as the second-best-performing narrative with average gains of 80.3%, and were supported by outsized rallies in privacy-focused chains Zcash and Monero, as well as resilience from Bitcoin Cash, BNB, and Tron. Notably, RWA and layer 1 were the only narratives to post a second consecutive profitable year. Meanwhile, the “Made in USA” narrative remained modestly positive at 30.6% YTD, largely due to Zcash offsetting losses elsewhere. At the opposite end of the spectrum, Gaming and DePIN recorded the steepest drawdowns of 75.2% and 76.7% YTD, while the Solana ecosystem fell 64.2% despite leading in mindshare.

Our Bonk price prediction for 2028 anticipates a price range of $0.00004137 to $0.00004728. In 2031, we expect the Bonk price to reach a maximum of $0.00007683 with an average of $0.00007388. Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 88.87 trillion. It is important to note that 87.99 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk’s supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine. Along with being a meme coin, the Bonk ecosystem is far more diverse. Several projects built around Bonk also increase its utility prospects, which makes it a popular choice among traders and is also considered the primary trigger behind its 2024 bull run. Bonk Swap, Bonk Rewards, and Bonk BOT are the main features of the Bonk ecosystem that also drive Bonk’s price. How will the utility of the Bonk ecosystem influence the value of the coin? Will BONK scale new heights? How high will BONK go in 2025? Let’s get into the BONK price prediction for 2025 and beyond.

As the bands are expanding, this signals an increase in volatility. The upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, serving as the resistance band, is at $0.00001000. Its lower limit, acting as the support, is around $0.00000713. BONK/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is in the neutral region.

Bonk price analysis predicts a bullish outcome regarding the ongoing market events. The coin’s value has ascended to $0.00000793, as an upturn was recorded today. Moreover, the overall market sentiment remained positive. Technical indicators support the bears, but the price charts favor the bulls for today. Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain triggered a surge in SOL’s price due to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has numerous side projects that enhance its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2031, Bonk will approach $0.00008, making it a worthwhile investment tool. However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the highly volatile meme coin market. Why is Bonk up? After a significant dip from $0.00000802 to $0.00000768 over the past few days, BONK is now experiencing some recovery as stakeholders start buying again. Support still exists at $0.00000786 and is expected to hold over the next trading sessions. Will Bonk reach $0.000045? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.0000189. Over the last few weeks, BONK saw a downtrend below this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.00004 by 2028. Will Bonk reach $1? According to the Bonk price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. However, analysts are optimistic about BONK, and some suggest long-term targets of $0.0001. Recent news/opinions on Bonk BONK ETP goes live on six (6) Swiss exchanges.

Bonk historic price sentiment Bonk price history. Source: Coingecko In December 2022, Bonk was launched with a price of $0.0000001487 and made history by making a surge of more than 30% in SOL tokens. Bonk cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 100 by market cap, reaching $0.0000034 per coin on January 5, 2023, giving a bullish outlook according to crypto market records. However, by March 2023, the price of the Bonk token had fallen from $0.0000004134, losing substantial value. In June 2023, Bonk’s price did not experience much action, and it gradually decreased to $0.0000001927 in September 2023. In October 2023, Bonk started to see bullish sentiment, with the price reaching $0.0000005518, which eventually reached $0.00002445 on December 15, 2023. Bonk closed 2023 with a price tag of $0.00001407, significantly higher than the price at the start of the year but almost 50% down from the highest price point of 2023. Bonk hit key highs in 2024, including $0.00003771 in March and an all-time high of $0.00004115 in May, before dipping to $0.0000223 in August. A late-year rally peaked at $0.00005825 in November, with the token closing 2024 at $0.00003043. At the start of January 2025, Bonk was trading at $0.00002976, and after further depreciation, it plunged to $0.000018 by February, as the market sentiment turned negative. In March, the token dipped to $0.00000959, but it recovered to $0.0000122 in April and $0.000021 in May as Bonk demand increased. In June, Bonk corrected down to $0.00001201, but in July 2025, it became bullish again and reached $0.00004072.

His projections suggest a period where blockchain infrastructure, artificial intelligence, and robotics advance simultaneously, reshaping digital markets and technology adoption. Yakovenko shared his outlook through a public post, forecasting that total stablecoin supply could exceed $1 trillion by 2026. Besides scale, his comments pointed toward limits in quantum computing progress, steady fusion challenges, and major breakthroughs in artificial intelligence. He also projected shipments of roughly 100,000 humanoid robots within the same period. Stablecoin Growth Faces Conflicting Views Yakovenko’s trillion-dollar stablecoin forecast contrasts with estimates from major financial institutions. JPMorgan Chase expects global stablecoin supply to reach between $500 billion and $600 billion by 2028. The bank links most stablecoin expansion to crypto trading activity rather than everyday payment usage. Significantly, JPMorgan reported that stablecoin supply has grown by about $100 billion this year alone. That growth pushed total supply to roughly $308 billion. USDT and USDC drove most of the increase. Additionally, derivatives platforms added nearly $20 billion in stablecoin balances as futures trading activity expanded. However, JPMorgan analysts emphasized that higher transaction volumes do not automatically require higher supply levels. Faster circulation could reduce the need for large issuance increases. Moreover, banks continue developing tokenized deposits, while central banks explore digital currencies that could compete with private stablecoins. Solana Market Performance and Technical Outlook Solana’s market price moved higher alongside renewed discussion around network adoption. SOL traded at $123 , posting a daily gain of 1.08%. Consequently, its market capitalization stood near $69.3 billion, supported by a circulating supply of about 560 million tokens. Source: X Crypto Patel, a market analyst, commented on investor behavior surrounding Solana’s long-term narrative. He noted that many holders remain emotionally tied to a $1,000 price target. However, he stressed that price cycles never move in a straight line. According to Patel, Solana currently trades within a corrective phase. A breakdown below the $120 support could push prices under $100. That level, he suggested, may offer a stronger long-term accumulation opportunity. His accumulation range extends from $98 down to $50. Long-Term Expectations Remain Divided Despite near-term volatility, long-range projections remain optimistic among some analysts. Patel outlined a long-term valuation range between $500 and $1,000 for SOL. Hence, market participants continue balancing innovation-driven optimism against cyclical risk management.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|SOL|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-27 20:05:08

XRP, in particular, is showing technical signals that suggest a potential bullish reversal could be imminent. While short-term volatility has spooked some traders, seasoned analysts highlight that price patterns, momentum indicators, and historical parallels point to a possible turnaround as XRP approaches key support levels. A recent post by STEPH IS CRYPTO on X emphasized that XRP’s price action is testing a downtrend line from August 2025. Steph pointed out that the convergence of technical indicators—including a MACD bullish crossover and an RSI at 37, indicating oversold conditions—signals that downward momentum may be slowing and that buyers could step in, setting the stage for a sharp rebound into 2026. $XRP : MASSIVE TREND REVERSAL INCOMING! pic.twitter.com/zIC2ziNeHu — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 26, 2025 Technical Analysis: Trendline, MACD, and RSI XRP’s daily chart shows the asset challenging a descending resistance line that has constrained rallies for months. The RSI, sitting near oversold territory , indicates that selling pressure may be near exhaustion, creating a potential entry point for bullish traders. Meanwhile, the MACD has signaled a bullish crossover, a classic momentum indicator suggesting that short-term averages are beginning to outpace longer-term averages, which often precedes upward price movements. Technical analysis also highlights that XRP’s trendline support has historically served as a pivot point where buyers emerge. Combined with oversold conditions, these signals indicate a higher probability of a bounce rather than a continuation of the downtrend. Historical Parallels: Lessons from 2022 Steph drew a comparison to 2022, when XRP broke a similar downtrend from $0.30. That breakout triggered a 150 % rally to $0.80 within months amid a broader crypto market recovery following the FTX collapse. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While history does not guarantee future outcomes, this pattern suggests that prolonged downtrend tests followed by momentum confirmation can precede substantial gains. Market Context and Institutional Factors The broader crypto market context also supports the potential for a reversal. XRP has demonstrated resilience during Q4 2025 selloffs, holding above critical support levels despite macro pressures and risk-off sentiment in global crypto markets. Institutional interest in XRP, particularly for On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) and cross-border settlement, provides a structural floor for the asset, creating buying pressure when prices approach key technical levels. Outlook: Preparing for a Reversal If XRP successfully breaks above the descending trendline and confirms momentum across MACD and RSI indicators, a significant trend reversal may be underway . Traders should watch for increasing buying pressure and volume, as these factors often confirm a shift from consolidation to an uptrend. While volatility remains, the alignment of technical setups, historical precedents, and market fundamentals suggests that XRP could experience a substantial rebound in the near term.

As of press time on December 27, 2025, XRP was trading at $1.85, reflecting an 11% year-to-date decline. XRP YTD stock price chart. Source: Finbold Based on this performance, XRP began the year at approximately $2.08, meaning a $1,000 investment made in early January 2025 would now be worth about $890, representing a loss of roughly $110 before fees or taxes. XRP 2025 performance This underperformance comes in a year that, on paper, should have been transformative for XRP. One of the most significant catalysts in 2025 was the final resolution of Ripple’s long-running legal dispute with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The settlement brought long-awaited regulatory clarity, removing a major overhang that had restricted institutional participation for years and effectively reframing XRP’s status in the U.S. market. Historically, such clarity has been viewed as a potential turning point for digital assets seeking broader adoption. Ripple also made a decisive push into institutional finance during the year. The expansion of its prime brokerage and liquidity services signaled a clear strategy to position XRP within traditional market infrastructure. At the same time, XRP gained exposure through regulated investment vehicles, including the launch and approval of spot XRP exchange-traded funds ( ETF ) in select jurisdictions, lowering the barrier to entry for both professional and retail investors. Another notable development was the rollout and broader integration of Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, RLUSD. While the stablecoin itself is not XRP, its usage within the ecosystem indirectly supports XRP through transaction fees and liquidity mechanics, adding another layer to the asset’s long-term utility narrative. Despite these structural advances, XRP’s price struggled to sustain momentum throughout 2025. Market sentiment remained fragile for much of the year, with repeated failures to hold above key resistance near $2. Broader crypto market volatility, combined with periodic XRP escrow releases and cautious investor positioning, weighed on price action. By late December, XRP had slipped into negative territory for the year, erasing gains seen earlier in 2025.

Under the revised framework, the system must process single cross-border renminbi payments using real-time gross settlement, while batch transactions must clear through timed net settlement. As a result, payments now follow two clearly separated tracks. Individual transfers settle one by one, immediately and irrevocably, reducing settlement risk between counterparties. At the same time, high-volume batch payments move through scheduled netting cycles, allowing the system to offset obligations and improve liquidity efficiency. In addition, the rules give the CIPS operator flexibility to adjust netting frequency, settlement windows, and processing schedules when transaction volumes or market conditions shift. This design aims to keep the system stable during peak cross-border payment periods while maintaining predictable settlement outcomes for participants. Operational control and system evolution The revised framework also reflects how China’ s cross-border payment infrastructure has evolved since CIPS launched in 2015. Initially built to support basic offshore renminbi settlement, the system has expanded alongside the international use of the yuan in trade, investment, and financial transactions. By locking in real-time settlement for single payments, regulators reinforce a structure similar to major global payment systems, where immediacy and finality limit systemic risk. Meanwhile, net settlement for batches mirrors long-standing international practices used to manage liquidity across large transaction flows. Oversight remains centralized under the People’s Bank of China , which supervises system rules, risk controls, and settlement discipline. Historical data show that Chinese authorities have repeatedly adjusted payment infrastructure rules following periods of market stress, including reforms after the global financial crisis and later enhancements tied to RMB internationalization. Taken together, the changes do not introduce a new payment rail. Instead, they clarify how existing settlement methods operate inside CIPS, formalize flexibility already used in practice, and align the system more closely with global payment standards as cross-border renminbi usage continues to grow.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,ASIA|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-27 20:15:22
