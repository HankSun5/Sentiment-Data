This has raised concerns among investors of WazirX who worry about its future. During a recent interview he had with TheStreet Roundtable host Mehab Qureshi, Shetty revealed that the long-running ownership dispute between WazirX and Binance has moved into litigation. “End of the day, I think it’s now gone into a stage of litigation,” he reportedly claimed. Ownership dispute between WazirX and Binance During the conversation, Shetty reiterated that WazirX was sold around late 2019-early 2020, following a public announcement at the time. However, what followed were conflicting claims, which saw both sides publicly disputing ownership of the platform. Binance denied holding any stake in WazirX. However, the Indian exchange claimed to have all the legal documents proving otherwise, which is how the ownership dispute began. As things stand, Shetty claims the dispute is at a “he said, she said” stage, which makes the outcome of the litigation much more important. When Shetty was asked whether Binance reached out to WazirX following the hack that shook the platform in July 2024, Shetty declined to comment, claiming the matter is under sub-judice. This is the latest development regarding the case, whose origins can be traced to the year 2019, after the crypto company announced that Binance had acquired it. What did Shetty say abou t cu stody dispute with Liminal? During his talk with TheStreet Roundtable host Mehab Qureshi, Shetty also addressed its dispute with Liminal, a digital asset custody and wallet infrastructure platform designed to help institutions, crypto exchanges, and digital asset businesses securely manage and store cryptocurrencies and tokenized assets. After the initial shock of the July 2024 hack that rocked WazirX by targeting its multi-signature wallet and resulting in a loss of over $230 million, the exchange blamed Liminal, claiming it was linked to Liminal’s multi-signature wallet infrastructure. It also pledged to migrate all remaining assets to a new multi-signature wallet, promising full transparency by publishing a list of all new wallets post-migration. Things got interesting when Liminal issued a counter-statement on October 22, 2024, denying responsibility for the breach. It claimed that 75 days after the hack, WazirX still held more than $175 million in assets on its platform, with roughly $50 million still under WazirX’s control via Liminal’s infrastructure. While in a conversation with TheStreet Roundtable host Mehab Qureshi, Shetty confirmed that the exchange had indeed been using Liminal’s software for custody infrastructure, but WazirX itself was always the primary point of contact for users. Shetty claims the exchange used Liminal’s technology for multi-key security with address whitelisting, ensuring that transactions could only be approved for preapproved wallets. “This was done so that even if all the devices of our team members got compromised, there’s a third party that would do the final check before authorizing a transaction,” he said. WazirX has claimed the cyberattack occurred through an external website used for fund management, not its own servers or hot wallets. “The cyber attack was not on the infrastructure, like the service of WazirX,” Shetty said . “It was a website that we were using for managing these funds, and through that website, the cyber attack happened”. According to him, the exchange had limited visibility into what happened “behind the scenes of a different website” and is awaiting further details from Liminal. “We only know our part. We have three laptops that were interacting with our website. Now we don’t know anything beyond that,” Shetty stated. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

In a detailed thread on X, Gaevoy said Wintermute disagrees with the proposal “as it stands,” while arguing that it asks tokenholders to commit to a major course of action without sufficient clarity on structure, governance, or outcomes. He disclosed that Wintermute has been an investor in AAVE since 2022 and participates actively in governance, but neither he nor the firm has any equity exposure to Aave Labs. Wintermute Slams Proposal According to the exec, the main issue is value accrual and a widening expectation mismatch between Aave Labs and a significant portion of AAVE tokenholders over who should capture value and how key external functions, particularly business development, should operate. He said those unresolved tensions make the current proposal premature and potentially harmful. Gaevoy also criticized the tone and politics surrounding the vote. While acknowledging that Aave founder Stani Kulechov’s communications “have been far from perfect,” he said the backlash against Aave Labs has gone too far and has negatively impacted the token’s price. Both sides, he added, are accusing each other of “hostile takeovers,” a claim he said has some validity depending on perspective. Gaevoy also said that reversing or softening earlier decisions, such as fee-related changes, could have helped reset the situation. But instead, the dispute escalated. He framed the vote as a “temperature check” rather than a decisive endpoint, saying the real priority should be de-escalation and serious work on long-term solutions for token value capture. While urging Aave Labs to engage constructively after the vote, Gaevoy wrote, “Whether it succeeds or fails doesn’t really matter.” The comments come as the token alignment proposal appears unlikely to pass. Snapshot data shows that a majority of AAVE DAO voters are opposed or abstaining, with roughly 55% voting against the proposal, about 41% abstaining, and 3.5% voting in favor. Voting is set for December 26. Critics have argued that Aave Labs rushed the governance process and pushed the proposal to a vote while discussions were still ongoing. The broader dispute traces back to a conflict over swap fee diversion, worth millions of dollars, that would have benefited the company rather than the DAO treasury. The alignment proposal itself focuses on tokenholders seeking control over Aave’s brand assets, including domains, social media accounts, and naming rights. The end goal is to ensure that any entity holding those assets remains accountable to the DAO. 2026 Roadmap Prior to the governance tensions, the platform laid out an ambitious roadmap for 2026 that aims to scale the protocol well beyond its current footprint. Kulechov unveiled the plan, which centers on three pillars: Aave V4, Horizon, and the Aave App. Aave V4 is expected to redesign the lending protocol to reduce liquidity fragmentation and support much larger capital flows. Horizon focuses on institutional users, allowing firms to borrow against tokenized real-world assets such as US Treasuries while meeting compliance needs. Meanwhile, the Aave App is positioned as a consumer-facing product aimed at onboarding millions of new users as Aave targets broader adoption.

Many investors are no longer chasing short-term moves. Instead, they are asking a more important question. Which cryptocurrencies still have room to grow before the next cycle matures? This is often when familiar names are re-evaluated and newer projects begin to stand out. Some are already showing early strength, even while prices remain low. That is why conversations around the best crypto to buy now are starting to include both established leaders and one new altcoin that has already climbed 250% while staying under $0.1. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum remains the backbone of much of the cryptocurrency market. Its ecosystem supports DeFi, NFTs, and a wide range of applications. With a massive market cap, ETH is often seen as a core holding rather than a high-growth play. Early investors benefited from strong moves when Ethereum was still building its foundation. Today, Ethereum faces a different challenge. Price action has repeatedly slowed near the $3,000 level. Many market commentators see this area as a major resistance zone. Breaking and holding above it has proven difficult without broad market momentum. This does not mean Ethereum lacks value. It means its growth profile has changed. At its current size, even strong adoption often translates into more gradual price movement. For investors looking for the next big cryptocurrency with higher upside potential, ETH’s role is increasingly about stability rather than acceleration. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu tells a different story. SHIB was one of the most talked-about crypto coins during its early surge. Early holders saw dramatic gains as attention poured in and price moved rapidly from near-zero levels. Now, SHIB faces its own resistance. Price action has struggled around the $0.00001 level. Market commentators often point out that SHIB’s large circulating supply makes sustained upward movement more difficult without renewed interest on a massive scale. While Shiba Inu still has a loyal community, its growth relies heavily on sentiment rather than utility. For many investors, that creates uncertainty when thinking about long-term positioning. This is why some are starting to shift focus toward projects with clearer use cases. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new DeFi crypto focused on decentralized lending and borrowing. Unlike meme-driven projects, its value proposition is tied directly to utility. Users will be able to supply assets, earn yield, and borrow against collateral in a system designed to adjust rates based on real usage. The presale began in early 2025 and has progressed steadily. The current token price is $0.035, and the project has already raised $19.45M. Participation has grown to 18,650 holders, with 825M tokens sold so far. Out of a fixed 4B total supply, 45.5% is allocated to the presale, equal to roughly 1.82B tokens. Phase 6 is now over 99% allocated, which means supply at the current price is nearly exhausted. Since Phase 1, the token has already climbed 250%, yet it remains well under $0.1. For those tracking crypto prices today and asking which crypto to buy now for long-term growth, this combination of low price and strong traction is drawing attention. MUTM vs SHIB Analysts often compare opportunities using practical examples. Consider a $500 investment. A $500 position in SHIB today depends largely on renewed hype to deliver strong returns. Given its large supply and established valuation, even optimistic scenarios tend to point toward more modest growth unless market conditions shift dramatically. A $500 position in MUTM at $0.035 offers a different profile. The official launch price is set at $0.06, which already represents a clear step up from current levels. Some analysts believe that if adoption develops as expected, MUTM could see 200% to 300% growth after launch. In more bullish scenarios tied to usage and exchange visibility, projections show even higher outcomes over time. This is not about guarantees. It is about structure. SHIB relies on sentiment. MUTM relies on a working protocol and demand tied to usage. V1 Launch and Security as Key Differentiators One reason analysts view Mutuum Finance as a stronger long-term contender is its development roadmap. According to official statements shared on X, V1 of the lending and borrowing protocol is planned for the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. Core features include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an automated liquidator bot. Initial supported assets will be ETH and USDT. Security has also been addressed early. Mutuum Finance has completed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 token scan score. An independent audit with Halborn Security is currently underway, reviewing finalized contracts. A $50k bug bounty has been launched to identify code vulnerabilities. As 2026 approaches, the question of what is the best cryptocurrency to invest in depends on goals. Ethereum offers scale and stability. Shiba Inu offers community and familiarity. Mutuum Finance offers early-stage exposure with a focus on real utility. For investors looking at the potential best crypto to buy now with an eye on growth rather than hype, this new altcoin under $0.1 is increasingly part of the conversation. With Phase 6 nearly complete and V1 on the horizon, Mutuum Finance is entering a stage where early traction and future potential begin to align.

56419499,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=884663,1766786403,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56419499.jpeg,"Investors are using funds, bars, coins, and miners to get exposure to silver",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/all-the-ways-silver-is-bought-and-sold/,"Silver broke $79 an ounce on Friday for the first time ever, capping off a run that’s left gold in the dust and dragged every other precious metal into the rally. Year-to-date, silver has surged more than 150% , way ahead of gold’s 70% rise. The rally has been tied to a mix of tight supplies, industrial buying, retail hoarding, and the U.S. under Donald Trump, labeling it a “critical mineral” in 2025. Buyers in solar, investment firms, and regular retail traders have all jumped in too, so this metal that would’ve gone to factories has instead ended up locked in vaults and ETFs. The largest volume of physical silver changes hands in London, where banks and brokers connect large institutional clients to the market. The trades happen over the counter, between two parties, not on an exchange. But this isn’t retail territory, folks, so you need a relationship with a major player to get in. HSBC and JPMorgan are two of the key banks storing the metal. As of late press time, these guys hold about 27,187 tons of silver in vaults across the city. There’s also the futures market, which handles massive volumes without anyone physically touching the metal. Two key hubs are the Shanghai Futures Exchange and COMEX in New York, run by CME Group, both allowing buyers and sellers to agree on a price today for silver that’s technically due later. But most people don’t wait, so the contracts are swapped out for newer ones, letting traders speculate without needing to store metal. Another perk is that the buyers don’t pay the full price up front. They only put up a margin, a small portion of the total value. Investors also use funds, bars, coins, and miners to get exposure to silver For retail investors (a.k.a. ‘dumb money’), silver ETFs have become the easiest way to get exposure, since, of course, they’re traded on platforms like NYSE and LSE, and sold on Robinhood (retailers’ favorite spot). Naturally, the biggest ETF is the iShares Silver Trust, managed by BlackRock, which holds around 529 million ounces, about $39 billion worth at current prices, according to data from the world’s largest asset manager itself. If enough buyers pile in and push the iShares silver ETF price above the real value of the metal, the fund adds more silver to its stash and issues new shares, because the goal here is to keep prices aligned. Some retailers still sell silver bars and coins to individual buyers, but it’s slower, and usually more expensive, though you’d be holding actual metal, so there is that. Some investors go another route too, like buying shares in mining companies whose stocks are easy to trade and tend to rise or fall with silver prices. But there’s more risk here; company debt, poor leadership, or bad earnings reports can crush a stock even if the metal is rallying. The surge in prices is also tied to supply hitting a wall. Most of the world’s major silver deposits have been exhausted, and new production isn’t keeping up. At the same time, solar manufacturers are buying more than ever. Retail traders are also stockpiling, choking the pipeline that would normally feed industrial demand. Not everyone’s bullish. Some traders argue that the silver market is too small and too volatile. Rachel Kwon, head of commodities at Luma Capital, warned , “This market can double or crash in weeks. There’s no in-between.” Still, others believe there’s more room to run. Some bulls say silver would need to jump above $200 an ounce to beat its 1980 inflation-adjusted high. While silver dominated headlines, gold also closed higher, hitting a record of $4,549.71 before settling at $4,552.70 for February futures. Platinum surged 9.8% to $2,437.72, reaching a peak of $2,454.12, and palladium spiked 14% to $1,927.81, its best level in over three years. All major precious metals logged weekly gains, with platinum posting its strongest performance on record. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

The company now tracks “European Commission fines” as a standard expense. The total reached $10.5 billion by September 30. This shows how penalties from the EU have become routine for the largest U.S. tech firms operating in Europe. In 2024, public technology companies based in Europe paid €3.2 billion in income tax. During the same year, regulators collected €3.8 billion in fines from U.S. technology firms. That means penalties alone exceeded the entire tax contribution of the listed European tech companies. Officials inside the bloc privately acknowledge that if SAP relocated operations to the United States, nearly half of that tax base would disappear, leaving fines as a growing revenue stream for the EU. EU regulators stack fines on Google across ads, Android, and AI The European Commission first fined Google €2.95 billion for adtech abuses tied to self-preferencing and conflicts inside its advertising supply chain. Regulators ordered the company to stop favoring its own ad services and restructure how it handles auctions and placement tools across Europe. Earlier rulings targeted mobile dominance. The Commission issued a €4.34 billion fine over illegal Android practices that forced device makers to pre-install Google Search and Chrome. Officials said those deals locked out rivals before users ever turned on their phones. Enforcement did not stop there. In December 2025, regulators opened a fresh investigation into whether Google uses publisher content and YouTube material to train its AI Overviews without fair payment. The probe focuses on whether that conduct harms competitors while boosting Google’s AI products inside the EU. EU laws pull Washington into a widening political clash Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has accused Brussels of targeting U.S. firms while allowing European companies to operate freely in America. His administration has warned of retaliation if enforcement continues. The U.S. State Department said this week it would deny visas to a former European commissioner and four others, stating they “have advanced censorship crackdowns by foreign states, in each case targeting American speakers and American companies.” Tensions escalated after the launch of the Digital Services Act, which apparently governs content moderation on social platforms, per the Commission’s notice . Shortly after, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative accused the EU and several member states of pushing “discriminatory and harassing lawsuits, taxes, fines and directives” against U.S. service providers while firms like Accenture, DHL, Siemens, and Spotify operate without similar barriers in the United States. Elon Musk’s platform X received the first fine under the DSA on December 5, totaling €120 million, or about $140 million, for design practices tied to the blue check system and allegedly blocking researcher access to public data, according to the EU. Alongside the DSA, the Digital Markets Act now governs competition. Seven gatekeepers fall under its scope: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Microsoft, Meta, and Booking.com. The DSA law strictly bans any forced use of pre-installed services, and it also requires an open App store choice from Apple, along with mandates on messaging interoperability. Apple had to pay €500 million in April for blocking alternative payments, while Meta paid €200 million for data use violations tied to Facebook and Instagram. European Commission president Urusula von der Lyn warned that repeat breaches from these companies will lead to penalties reaching 20% of global turnover.

Price remains capped below the $90,000 level, with repeated recovery attempts failing to gain traction. As volatility compresses and participation thins, an increasing number of analysts are warning that the market may face further downside before stability can return. For now, conviction on both sides remains limited, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to renewed selling pressure. On-chain data underscores this fragile backdrop. A recent report by Axel Adler examines daily capital inflows and outflows across the Bitcoin network, using a seven-day moving average of net capital flow to assess market health. This metric captures the balance between realized profits, which represent capital entering the network, and realized losses, which reflect capital being destroyed through loss-making sales. When the net flow turns negative, it signals that participants are selling at a loss more aggressively than they are taking profits. Currently, the seven-day average stands at approximately negative $160 million, meaning the market has been losing an average of $160 million in capital per day over the past week. The period between December 17 and 24 was marked by sharp volatility , with large outflows interspersed with brief positive days. Although December 25 saw another net inflow, it was not enough to offset prior losses. Elevated Coin Activity Signals Distribution Under the Surface On-chain data highlighted by Adler shows that Bitcoin remains unusually active despite weak market conditions. The Bitcoin “% Supply Active (Last 180 Days)” metric tracks the share of total BTC supply that has moved at least once over the past six months. Currently, that figure stands at 31.79%, slightly above its 30-day average of 31.43% and firmly in the 80th percentile compared with historical data. Activity has also risen sharply on a year-over-year basis, up 14.4%, indicating that coins are changing hands far more frequently than they were a year ago. At face value, elevated activity can sometimes signal renewed interest or accumulation. In the current context, however, it carries a more cautionary implication. High supply activity is occurring alongside a negative net capital flow regime, meaning that much of this movement reflects loss-making sales rather than profitable distribution. Coins are not simply rotating between long-term holders; they are being sold under pressure. This combination challenges the idea that the market is simply apathetic. Instead, it points to active distribution, with holders choosing to exit positions despite unfavorable prices. The distinction is important: apathy implies indecision, while distribution suggests stress. For this metric to turn constructive, elevated activity would need to persist while net capital flows recover toward zero or positive territory. Only then would increased coin movement begin to reflect accumulation rather than capitulation. Bitcoin Stabilizes As Key Trend Loses Momentum Bitcoin is trading around the $88,700 level on the 3-day chart, attempting to stabilize after a sharp correction from the $120,000–$125,000 highs set earlier in the year. While the broader uptrend that began in 2024 remains technically intact, the current structure reflects a clear loss of momentum and a transition into a corrective phase. Price action has shifted from strong impulsive moves to choppy consolidation, highlighting growing uncertainty among market participants. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin is now trading below its faster-moving average, which has rolled over and begun acting as dynamic resistance. The loss of this level marked a decisive change in market character, confirming that rallies are being sold rather than extended. At the same time, price is hovering just above the rising longer-term moving average, which continues to provide structural support and defines the boundary between a healthy correction and a deeper trend reversal. Volume dynamics reinforce the cautious outlook. The most aggressive volume expansion occurred during the sell-off from above $110,000, while the recent rebound toward $88,000 has unfolded on relatively muted participation. This suggests that selling pressure has eased, but buyers have not returned with conviction. Structurally, the $86,000–$90,000 range is critical. Holding above this zone preserves the broader bullish framework. However, a failure to reclaim the $95,000–$100,000 region would keep Bitcoin vulnerable to renewed downside pressure in the weeks ahead.

We asked the new version, GPT 5.2, to do price forecast for XRP, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu, and it delivered a quite interesting AI price outlook. Below are ChatGPT’s dual-scenario predictions outlining monumental potential gains and the downside hazards for each asset throughout December and going into 2026. Ripple (XRP): ChatGPT Predicts a Potential Rally To $4.20 If adoption for XRP declines and macro liquidity tightens, keeping XRP stuck below major resistance, ChatGPT AI predicts a total collapse for XRP to $1.20. That kind of drop would be completely out of character for XRP this year. After Ripple scored a major legal win against the SEC, XRP went on to hit a new all-time high around $3.65 in July. Most analysts think that momentum is not done yet. Even ChatGPT-based models are pointing to a possible move back into the $3.50 to $4.20 range as we head toward 2026. Between the RLUSD stablecoin launch, ongoing integrations, and growing adoption especially across Asia and Japan, plus steady ETF inflows, the setup is there. If the bull market keeps running, XRP breaking into fresh all-time highs in 2026 is very much on the table. Source: TradingView To fully reverse its downtrend, XRP needs to climb above the $2.2 level. This would break the token’s bearish price structure. This could set the stage for a strong recovery to $3 at least. A New Memecoins Cycle Could Be Led By Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Google Trends data shows that interest in memecoins has dropped to a five-year low. That loss of attention is showing up in the price too, with the memecoin sector down roughly 60% this year overall. For the Dogecoin bull case, ChatGPT sees momentum coming back in a big way, with DOGE potentially pushing into the $0.30 to $0.35 range heading into 2026. That outlook is built on the idea of a fresh memecoin cycle combined with a broader risk-on shift across the market. That is also why Bitcoin matters so much here. When BTC breaks out, capital usually rotates into memecoins, and as the leaders of the pack, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu tend to feel that move almost right away. The same story applies to Shiba Inu. It launched back in 2020 as a Dogecoin challenger and has since grown into a heavyweight, with a market cap sitting around $4.83 billion. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB also has a major network upgrade planned for 2026. The upgrade is expected to add a privacy layer, which could end up being the key catalyst that helps the token regain momentum when interest in memecoins picks back up. Shiba Inu is having a hard time finding any real momentum heading into Christmas, and the mood around it feels pretty undecided. SHIB is down roughly 1.7% over the last 24 hours. It has been stuck chopping in a tight range between $0.00000697 and $0.00000717. That kind of sideways action usually signals a sleepy market, and right now price is sitting closer to the bottom of that range. For this bounce to actually matter, SHIB needs to push above $0.00000800 and stay there. Maxi Doge Is Positioning For The Next Meme Rotation While ChatGPT is laying out big upside and downside scenarios for XRP, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu. Some traders are looking past the majors and focusing on where early momentum is quietly building. That is where Maxi Doge keeps popping up. Maxi Doge is leaning fully into the high-risk, high-reward side of the next memecoin cycle. When attention is low and sentiment is washed out. That is usually when early meme winners start getting accumulated before the crowd shows up. Right now, memecoin interest is near multi-year lows, which historically has been the exact environment where explosive rotations begin. The project has already raised over $4.28M, even while the broader memecoin sector looks completely dead. That kind of traction in a slow market suggests conviction, not hype chasing. On top of that, Maxi Doge is offering staking rewards up to 72% APY. This give holders a strong reason to lock in early and wait instead of flipping for short-term moves. If ChatGPT is right and 2026 brings renewed risk appetite and a fresh memecoin cycle. The biggest gains usually do not come from the old names everyone already owns. They come from the aggressive new plays that were built quietly during boredom phases. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu wait for momentum to return, Maxi Doge is already setting its base. When the rotation hits, that difference tends to matter fast. Maxi Doge is available through its presale using ETH, USDT, BNB, or a credit card directly on the official website .

A new hope is building that it will be the bullish year the market has been waiting for. XRP, Solana, and Cardano are all sitting on clean pullbacks and have been consolidating within steady price ranges for some time. Their next move higher may be approaching for the following reasons. Ripple (XRP): The OG Crypto That Could Still Be the Best Crypto Pick XRP ETFs have been pulling in serious money even while the price action looks completely dead. As of December 23, spot XRP ETFs logged about $1.13B in net inflows, with steady buying pressure holding up for the past 33 days. That performance actually puts them ahead of both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which have struggled to keep momentum during the same choppy market conditions. When you stack that ETF demand on top of ongoing ecosystem upgrades, major milestones, and a technically solid chart, 2026 is starting to look like it could be a really interesting year for XRP. Source: TradingView To fully reverse its downtrend, XRP needs to climb above the $2.2 level. This would break the token’s bearish price structure. This could set the stage for a strong recovery to $3 at least. Solana (SOL): The Coin of the Cycle Could Run It Back in 2026 Solana had an insane run starting in December 2024, topping out near $294 in January. Since then, it has been cut down hard and is now more than 50% off that peak. That kind of move is not new for SOL. Historically, it tends to overcorrect on the way down and then massively outperform once risk appetite comes back. Just look at the post-FTX collapse. SOL went from around $250 all the way down to about $8. A lot of people wrote it off for good, but it ended up ripping more than 30× after that. Source: TradingView As long as Solana stays above $120, the bullish setup is still intact. The big thing missing right now is volume. Buying pressure is pretty light, which shows bulls are hesitant and not fully stepping in yet. Without a real volume spike, any move above resistance risks turning into just another fake breakout. What would actually flip the script is a clean break above $144 with strong volume behind it. That kind of move would act like a trigger and could kick off the next leg higher. Cardano (ADA): $1 Back in Play After a Brutal Correction Cardano has taken a pretty hard hit lately, but it might be setting up for a bounce. Price is now drifting back toward an area where buyers have stepped in aggressively before, which could act as a base for a rebound. For ADA to really flip bullish, it needs to push above $0.36 and stay there. If that happens, the next hurdle is $0.38, a level it has already been rejected from twice in the past week. If ADA cannot break through, a dip back toward the $0.30 area is still on the table. The RSI is sitting around 40 and is not oversold yet, which means there is still room for downside in the short term. That said, as long as ADA holds above the previous low near $0.27, the bigger bullish setup stays intact going into the new year. Bitcoin Hyper Could Be the Real Christmas Eve Sleeper While most traders are checked out for the holidays and majors like XRP, SOL, and ADA grind through slow consolidations, Bitcoin Hyper is quietly doing the opposite and that is usually how early winners start. Bitcoin Hyper is built around one clear idea: giving Bitcoin real speed and utility without sacrificing security. It runs as a Bitcoin Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine. This means fast transactions, low fees, and full settlement back to Bitcoin. In a market where people are tired of bloated Layer 1 narratives, that combo is starting to stand out. The numbers back it up. Bitcoin Hyper has already raised over $29M, even with sentiment still shaky and volumes thin across the market. That kind of capital does not show up by accident, especially during the holidays when most investors are sitting on their hands. On top of that, staking rewards are sitting around 39% APY , which gives holders a reason to stay locked in rather than flip for short term noise. That is exactly how supply pressure quietly builds before bigger moves. When the market finally wakes up in the new year and risk appetite rotates back in, the projects that were accumulated during boring, low-volume phases tend to move first. While everyone waits for XRP to break $2.20, SOL to reclaim $144, or ADA to flip $0.36, Bitcoin Hyper is already positioning itself ahead of that rotation. Sometimes the best Christmas opportunity is the one no one is paying attention to yet.

Founders from both chains are reportedly teaming up to launch a new bridge that connects their ecosystems, a move that could redirect major trading volume toward Solana. For years, Solana and Cardano have battled for dominance as “Ethereum killers,” each taking a different approach. Solana is known for its blazing speed and low fees, while Cardano has focused on security and a careful, research-driven development process. Now, instead of competing for attention, the two may be aligning, and that shift toward collaboration could reshape the entire Layer 1 landscape. Time to get cooking https://t.co/jqMPw7R4Gl pic.twitter.com/jsjw4Tinfr — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 23, 2025 In a series of X posts, both Charles Hoskinson (Cardano’s founder) and Anatoly Yakovenko (Solana) agreed to start working on a bridge. This is a sign that the crypto space is maturing. Founders are recognizing that the next era of growth will come from building alliances through interoperability. This bridge could tap into the strengths of each network, allowing $SOL holders and users to take advantage of its privacy and security features. Meanwhile, Cardano’s users would benefit from getting access to a thriving DeFi market. Solana Price Prediction: SOL Needs to Move Above $125 to Reverse Its Downtrend Solana has broken below its long-held support at $127 and is now fighting to stay above $120, with trading activity and transaction volumes declining steadily over recent months. This bearish breakdown leaves SOL vulnerable to a deeper correction toward the $100 mark, a sharp contrast to just a few months ago when it was trading near $230. A move back above $125 would be a critical shift, potentially invalidating the current downtrend and opening the door to a short-term recovery. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests that SOL is consolidating. Interestingly, RSI has formed a mild bullish divergence, failing to make a lower low even as the price continued to fall, which could hint at a momentum shift. While Solana meme coins have been quiet this cycle, a new Ethereum-based project is starting to make noise. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has already raised over $4 million, bringing meme energy and community-driven trading culture back to the forefront with a fresh approach built around staking, challenges, and shared alpha.

However, newly emerging on-chain activity suggests the Dogecoin price prediction is split between bullish reversal and bearish continuation scenarios. $Doge /daily #Dogecoin has reached the previous symmetrical triangle breakdown target. It's now forming a new chart pattern and searching for a new trend. pic.twitter.com/uWq2WW90yi — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) December 26, 2025 Long-Term Holders Accumulate as Speculative Supply Contracts According to Glassnode data , Dogecoin speculative supply is contracting while longer-term holders display early accumulation signals. The 1-year to 2-year holder cohort has expanded its share of Dogecoin supply from approximately 21.84% to 22.34%. While the increase appears modest, the signal carries significance. Source: Glassnode These holders typically accumulate only when they believe downside risk is beginning to diminish. Network coin activity, measured via the spent coins metric, reinforces this perspective. The on-chain amount spent on coins has plummeted sharply. The spent coins age band metric dropped from roughly 251.97 million DOGE to about 94.34 million DOGE, representing a decline exceeding 60% in coin movement. Reduced coin activity potentially indicates fewer holders are rushing to transfer or liquidate tokens. Historically, similar activity declines have preceded short-term relief rallies in Dogecoin. Earlier in December, a comparable slowdown preceded a rally from near $0.132 to $0.151, a nearly 15% move within three days. Dogecoin Price Prediction: 4-Hour Chart Shows Defined Downtrend Structure The chart shows Dogecoin trading in a well-defined downtrend on the 4-hour timeframe, with price currently hovering around the $0.125 region. Market structure remains bearish, characterized by lower highs and lower lows, and price continues to trade below all highlighted resistance zones. The most immediate level to watch is the $0.12 area, which has been marked as a critical support. Source: TradingView This level is acting as a demand floor for now, but repeated tests weaken its strength, increasing the risk of a breakdown if sellers remain dominant. On the upside, the $0.14 zone stands out as an important resistance, aligning with prior consolidation and multiple rejection points. As long as Dogecoin remains below this level, upside attempts are likely to be corrective rather than trend-reversing. A more meaningful bullish confirmation would only emerge if price reclaims and holds above the broader $0.16 resistance band. Such a move would signal a shift in momentum and could open the door for a recovery toward $0.18 first and potentially $0.20–$0.21, which aligns with the higher target levels marked on the chart. Until then, rallies into resistance are likely to attract selling pressure. Momentum indicators reinforce the cautious outlook. The RSI is sitting near the low-40s, below the neutral 50 level, indicating weak momentum and a market that still favors sellers. While RSI is not deeply oversold, suggesting room for short-term bounces, it does not yet show the strength typically associated with trend reversals. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Presale Brings Solana’s Speed to Bitcoin for the First Time As Dogecoin eyes a breakout, its chances improve if Bitcoin starts climbing toward $100,000 again, especially with gold and stocks hitting new highs. In moments like this, early presales often see the biggest gains, and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is quickly becoming one to watch. Already nearing $30 million raised, the project is building the first true Layer 2 for Bitcoin powered by Solana tech, combining lightning-fast speed and low fees with Bitcoin’s unmatched security. It’s a bold move that could reshape how apps and users interact with the Bitcoin network. As more crypto wallets and exchanges begin adopting this technology, demand for $HYPER tokens is expected to increase substantially.

Price action has narrowed into a tight range, with neither buyers nor sellers able to assert clear control. As volatility compresses, apathy has become a defining feature of the current environment, and an increasing number of analysts are openly discussing the possibility that the market is transitioning toward a broader bear phase. Related Reading: XRP Exchange Reserves On Binance Fall To Six-Month Low: Selling Pressure Is Easing While price levels dominate headlines, on-chain data suggests the more important battle is unfolding beneath the surface. According to CryptoQuant analyst Burak Kesmeci, Bitcoin’s current positioning cannot be understood by price alone. Instead, attention is shifting toward the cost bases of key market participants, particularly whales and Binance spot users. Even with Bitcoin trading around $87,000, the most consequential level sits significantly higher. Data shows that the average cost basis of new whales, defined as holders with coins younger than 155 days, is clustered around $100,500. This zone represents a critical break-even threshold for large players who entered the market recently. As a result, every approach toward $100,000 carries heightened significance. That level may either trigger distribution, as whales seek to protect capital, or mark the start of renewed accumulation if confidence returns. Cost Basis Data Maps Bitcoin Real Support and Resistance The report highlights that beneath Bitcoin’s current price action, cost basis data offers a clearer framework for understanding market risk. For Binance spot users, the average cost basis sits near $56,000. This level represents the largest concentration of spot volume in the market and effectively defines the “deep water” zone if conditions deteriorate. In a prolonged bearish phase, $56K is where the bulk of spot holders would be tested, making it a critical long-term support area rather than a short-term trading level. Long-term whale positioning adds another important layer. The cost basis for whales holding Bitcoin longer than 155 days is clustered around $40,000. This means these participants are still sitting on profits of more than 2x, even after the recent correction. That profit cushion helps explain the rise in realized gains seen over recent weeks. For many long-term holders, current prices already represent a satisfactory exit, increasing the incentive to distribute into strength rather than aggressively accumulate. Taken together, the data reframes Bitcoin’s market structure. The key short-term ceiling remains near $100,000, where newer whales approach breakeven and supply tends to emerge. On the downside, $56,000 stands out as the level where spot market conviction would be most severely tested. Related Reading: Ethereum Bearish Structure Meets Bullish Supply Signal – What Happens Next Bitcoin Consolidates Above Key Weekly Support as Momentum Cools Bitcoin is trading near the $88,700 level on the weekly chart, stabilizing after a sharp pullback from the $120,000–$125,000 highs reached earlier this cycle. While the broader uptrend from 2024 remains intact, recent price action signals a clear slowdown in momentum. The market has shifted from an impulsive expansion phase into a corrective and consolidative structure, with volatility compressing around a critical support zone. Technically, Bitcoin is holding just above its rising medium-term moving average, which has acted as dynamic support throughout this bull cycle. The rejection above $110,000 marked a decisive loss of upside control, and the failure to quickly reclaim that zone suggests distribution rather than a brief pause. At the same time, price remains well above the long-term moving average, reinforcing that this move is still corrective within a larger trend, not yet a confirmed trend reversal. Related Reading: Bitcoin and Ethereum Coinbase Inflows Collapse While Binance Retains Relative Activity – Details Volume dynamics support this interpretation. Selling pressure expanded during the initial breakdown, but recent weeks show declining volume as price stabilizes between roughly $86,000 and $90,000. This points to seller exhaustion, though buyers have yet to step in with conviction. Structurally, the $86,000–$88,000 range is pivotal. Holding this zone keeps the higher-timeframe bullish structure alive. A clean breakdown would expose deeper downside. While a recovery above $95,000 would be needed to reassert bullish momentum and reopen the path toward prior highs.

This development sends shockwaves through the digital asset industry, highlighting persistent security vulnerabilities. Authorities accuse the individual of providing system access to hackers in exchange for cash payments. Consequently, this case raises critical questions about insider threats within cryptocurrency platforms. Coinbase Employee Arrested in Major Security Breach Indian law enforcement officials detained the Coinbase employee following an investigation into unauthorized access at the exchange. Bloomberg’s initial report indicates the arrest occurred in a major metropolitan area. The employee allegedly compromised internal systems. Furthermore, this incident represents one of the most significant insider threat cases in recent cryptocurrency history. Security experts immediately expressed concern about the implications for user funds and data protection. Coinbase confirmed it is cooperating fully with international authorities. The exchange emphasized its commitment to security protocols. However, this arrest follows a pattern of increasing cyber threats targeting cryptocurrency platforms. For instance, 2024 witnessed several high-profile exchange breaches globally. These incidents collectively resulted in millions of dollars in losses. Therefore, the industry faces mounting pressure to enhance internal controls. Cryptocurrency Exchange Hacking Trends and Patterns Insider threats represent approximately 30% of all security incidents in financial technology according to recent cybersecurity reports. The cryptocurrency sector proves particularly vulnerable due to its rapid growth and technical complexity. Moreover, exchanges manage billions in digital assets daily. This concentration of value attracts sophisticated criminal elements. Consequently, platforms must implement multi-layered security frameworks. Recent Major Exchange Security Incidents (2023-2024) Exchange Incident Type Estimated Loss Primary Vector Coinbase (2025) Insider Threat Under Investigation Employee Access Multiple Platforms (2024) Smart Contract Exploit $320 Million Code Vulnerability Asian Exchange (2023) Phishing Attack $45 Million Social Engineering Decentralized Exchange (2024) Bridge Hack $190 Million Protocol Weakness This table illustrates the diverse attack vectors threatening cryptocurrency exchanges. Insider threats remain especially difficult to detect and prevent. Traditional security measures often focus on external defenses. However, authorized personnel with malicious intent can bypass these protections. The Coinbase case demonstrates this vulnerability clearly. Security analysts now advocate for behavioral monitoring and zero-trust architectures. Expert Analysis of Insider Threat Management Cybersecurity specialists emphasize several critical measures for preventing insider threats. First, exchanges must implement strict access controls following the principle of least privilege. Second, continuous monitoring of employee activities provides early warning signs. Third, regular security audits identify potential vulnerabilities. Finally, comprehensive employee screening and ongoing training create a security-conscious culture. Blockchain forensic firms already assist in investigating the Coinbase incident. These companies specialize in tracing cryptocurrency transactions across public ledgers. Their techniques help identify fund movements following security breaches. Additionally, international law enforcement cooperation has improved significantly in recent years. This collaboration enables faster response to cross-border cryptocurrency crimes. India Crypto Security Incident and Regulatory Response India’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation has evolved considerably. The country implemented strict anti-money laundering rules for virtual digital assets in 2023. These regulations require exchanges to maintain detailed transaction records. Furthermore, Indian authorities now actively pursue cryptocurrency-related crimes. The arrest of the Coinbase employee demonstrates this increased vigilance. The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) likely participated in the investigation. This agency handles cybersecurity threats nationwide. Their involvement suggests the technical complexity of the case. Additionally, the Financial Intelligence Unit India monitors suspicious transactions. Their data possibly contributed to identifying the alleged insider threat. Enhanced Due Diligence: Exchanges now face pressure to strengthen employee screening processes. Technical Safeguards: Multi-signature wallets and transaction limits gain importance. International Cooperation: Cross-border investigations become standard practice. Insurance Coverage: Demand for cryptocurrency insurance products increases significantly. User Protection: Platforms emphasize security features like withdrawal whitelists. These developments reflect the industry’s response to security challenges. However, balancing security with usability remains difficult. Excessive controls can hinder legitimate user activities. Therefore, exchanges must find optimal security configurations. The Coinbase incident will undoubtedly influence industry standards globally. Broader Implications for Exchange Security Protocols The alleged insider threat at Coinbase affects the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Investors naturally question the safety of their assets on centralized platforms. Consequently, exchanges face renewed scrutiny of their security practices. Regulatory bodies may introduce stricter requirements for personnel management. Additionally, insurance providers could adjust their coverage terms and premiums. Decentralized exchanges might benefit from increased user adoption following this incident. These platforms eliminate central points of failure by design. However, they present different security challenges including smart contract risks. Therefore, no perfect solution exists currently. The industry continues developing hybrid approaches combining centralized and decentralized elements. Security researchers emphasize several emerging technologies for preventing insider threats. Artificial intelligence systems can analyze employee behavior patterns. Blockchain-based access logs create immutable audit trails. Biometric authentication adds another security layer. These technologies collectively reduce but cannot eliminate risks entirely. Human factors remain the most unpredictable element in security equations. Conclusion The Coinbase employee arrested in India represents a significant moment for cryptocurrency security. This incident highlights the persistent threat of insider attacks within digital asset exchanges. The industry must address this vulnerability through technological and procedural improvements. International cooperation between regulators and law enforcement proves essential for investigating such cases. Ultimately, security remains the foundation for mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. Exchanges that demonstrate robust protection mechanisms will maintain user trust despite these challenges. FAQs Q1: What exactly did the Coinbase employee allegedly do?

This clarification, issued from Zug, Switzerland, on March 15, 2025, directly addresses community concerns that emerged following the rejection of a high-stakes proposal for the Aave DAO to absorb Aave Labs. The situation underscores the persistent tension between founder vision and community-led governance in the maturing DeFi sector. Aave Governance Faces Scrutiny After Major Token Acquisition The controversy centers on a significant transaction executed by Kulechov. Blockchain analytics firms publicly recorded the purchase of a substantial amount of AAVE tokens, worth approximately $15 million, from the open market. Consequently, this transaction occurred during a sensitive period for the Aave decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Specifically, the community was actively debating Proposal AIP-121, which sought to formalize and fund a renewed scope of work for Aave Labs, the protocol’s primary development team, by having the DAO absorb it. The proposal ultimately failed to reach the required consensus threshold. Following the proposal’s rejection, some community members expressed apprehension. They questioned whether the founder’s large-scale token acquisition could potentially sway future governance votes, undermining the decentralized ethos of the protocol. In response, Kulechov provided a clear statement to several crypto news outlets. He confirmed the factual nature of the purchase but emphasized a critical distinction: he did not utilize these newly acquired tokens in any governance voting related to the proposal. “My commitment has always been to the protocol’s long-term health, not to centralizing decision-making power,” Kulechov stated. Understanding the Mechanics of Aave’s Decentralized Governance To fully grasp the implications, one must understand how Aave governance operates. The Aave DAO uses a token-based voting system where one AAVE token typically equals one vote. Holders can delegate their voting power to representatives or vote directly on proposals that dictate the protocol’s future, including: Parameter adjustments: Changes to interest rates, collateral factors, and asset listings. Treasury management: Decisions on fund allocation from the community treasury. Strategic partnerships: Approvals for integrations and ecosystem expansions. Developer funding: Proposals like AIP-121 to resource core development teams. Therefore, large token acquisitions by influential figures naturally attract scrutiny. The system’s integrity relies on the assumption that voting power is distributed and not susceptible to undue concentration. Aave’s governance dashboard shows that voting power is distributed among thousands of addresses, but a subset of large holders, often called “whales,” can exert significant influence. The Delicate Balance Between Founders and DAOs This event is not isolated in the DeFi landscape. Experts point to a recurring pattern where founding teams and DAOs navigate a complex relationship. “The transition from founder-led startup to community-owned protocol is the most challenging phase in DeFi,” notes Dr. Elena Torres, a researcher at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. “Founders retain deep expertise and vision, but the community rightly guards against centralization. Transparent communication, as seen here, is essential for maintaining trust.” The table below contrasts typical founder motivations with community concerns in such scenarios: Potential Founder Motivation Common Community Concern Signal long-term belief in the protocol Attempt to control governance outcomes Personal financial investment strategy Creation of a centralized decision-making point Align incentives with token holders Reduction of the protocol’s censorship resistance Historical Context and Precedents in DeFi Governance The Aave situation echoes past debates within other major protocols. For instance, the Uniswap DAO has repeatedly discussed the role of Uniswap Labs and its founders. Similarly, Compound Finance has seen proposals that adjust the balance of power between its founding team and COMP token holders. These precedents show a sector-wide evolution. Initially, many protocols launched with significant founder and venture capital allocations. Over time, successful protocols work to decentralize this control through community grants, broad token distributions, and transparent governance processes. In Aave’s case, the protocol has historically demonstrated a strong commitment to decentralization. The Aave DAO controls a treasury worth billions of dollars and has successfully passed numerous proposals without major controversy. The reaction to Kulechov’s purchase, therefore, reflects the community’s vigilance rather than a systemic failure. It highlights an advanced stage of governance maturity where participants actively police potential conflicts of interest. Market Impact and Protocol Performance Metrics Analyzing the market response provides further context. Following the news of both the proposal rejection and the clarification, the AAVE token price showed short-term volatility but quickly stabilized. More importantly, key protocol health metrics remained robust. According to data from DeFiLlama, Aave’s total value locked (TVL) across its V2 and V3 deployments has held steady above $12 billion. Furthermore, the protocol continues to generate significant revenue from borrowing fees, indicating that user activity and trust in the underlying lending markets were not materially affected by the governance discussion. This resilience suggests that the market distinguishes between governance debates and fundamental protocol utility. “Sophisticated participants understand that public disputes over governance are a feature, not a bug, of a healthy DAO,” says Marcus Chen, a partner at a crypto-focused hedge fund. “It shows the system is working. The real risk is apathy, not debate.” The Path Forward for Transparent DeFi Governance This episode offers several lessons for the broader decentralized finance ecosystem. First, it underscores the need for clear communication from key stakeholders during sensitive governance periods. Kulechov’s prompt clarification helped mitigate uncertainty. Second, it highlights potential areas for governance model innovation. Some communities are experimenting with: Time-locked governance tokens: Vesting schedules that prevent immediate voting use after purchase. Reputation-based systems: Supplementing token voting with non-financial reputation scores. Improved transparency dashboards: Real-time tools that track voting power concentration and delegate activity. For Aave specifically, the path forward likely involves continued dialogue. The DAO may revisit aspects of its working relationship with Aave Labs in a new proposal. The community’s demonstrated engagement is a positive sign for the protocol’s decentralized future. Conclusion The clarification from Aave founder Stani Kulechov regarding his $15 million AAVE token purchase has served as a critical stress test for the protocol’s governance framework. While the transaction raised valid questions about potential influence, the subsequent public discourse and the founder’s transparency have ultimately reinforced the robustness of community-led oversight. This event exemplifies the maturing nature of Aave governance , where vigilance, communication, and a commitment to decentralized principles help navigate complex situations. As DeFi continues to evolve, such transparent resolutions set a vital precedent for balancing founder expertise with the immutable requirement for decentralized control. FAQs Q1: What was the Aave DAO proposal that was rejected? The rejected proposal, AIP-121, sought for the Aave DAO to formally absorb and fund Aave Labs, the protocol’s primary development team, with a renewed scope of work and budget. It did not achieve the necessary consensus to pass. Q2: Did Stani Kulechov use the newly purchased tokens to vote? No. Kulechov explicitly clarified that while the $15 million token purchase was factual, he did not use those specific tokens to participate in governance voting on the AIP-121 proposal or any other recent measures. Q3: Why do large token purchases by founders concern DeFi communities? Large purchases can concentrate voting power, potentially allowing a single entity to unduly influence the direction of a supposedly decentralized protocol. This conflicts with the core DeFi principles of censorship resistance and distributed control. Q4: How did the AAVE token and protocol performance react to this news? The AAVE token experienced short-term volatility but quickly stabilized. More importantly, fundamental protocol metrics like Total Value Locked (TVL) and revenue generation remained strong, indicating underlying user trust was not damaged. Q5: What does this event mean for the future of Aave governance? The event demonstrates an actively engaged community and may lead to discussions about governance model improvements, such as time-locks on voting power for newly acquired tokens. It reinforces that transparent communication is essential for maintaining trust in a DAO.

China has announced new regulations that will make it significantly easier for commercial rocket companies developing reusable launch technology to access public capital markets. New requirements to list on the STAR marke t T he Shanghai Stock Exchange revealed on Friday that firms working on reusable rockets can now bypass standard financial requirements like profitability limits and minimum revenue requirements when listing on the tech-focused STAR market. These firms will instead be required to demonstrate that they have achieved at least one successful orbital launch using their reusable rocket technology. The United States currently dominates the reusable rocket sector, with SpaceX’s Falcon 9 being the only regularly operational reusable rocket system that routinely delivers satellites into orbit. Earlier in December, LandSpace, China’s leading private rocket manufacturer, conducted the country’s first full test of a reusable rocket with its new Zhuque-3 model. The launch successfully placed a satellite into orbit using reusable rocket technology, but the mission did not complete the critical step of recovering the rocket’s first-stage booster. China’s commercial space ambitions and national security priorities were not helped much by the half-full, half-empty outcome of the mission. China aims to deploy tens of thousands of satellites into low-Earth orbit within the coming decades, creating a large network of constellations that would rival or exceed SpaceX’s Starlink network . The country’s officials believe that SpaceX’s dominant position in the industry is a national security concern. The country is actively deploying two major satellite megaconstellations including the Guowang network, which is managed by state-owned China Satellite Network Group and plans to deploy up to 13,000 satellites. The networ k al ready launched over 100 satellites as of November 2025. The Qianfan constellation, backed by Shanghai’s municipal government, aims to deploy approximately 15,000 satellites by 2030 and has launched around 90 satellites to date. Starlink currently has 6,800 active satellites. Is the new regulation necessary? LandSpace has stated publicly that it will need access to China’s capital markets to remain competitive with SpaceX. Similar to other high-tech sectors where companies require massive upfront investment before generating profits by removing profitability and revenue barriers, the Shanghai Stock Exchange is giving rocket companies the opportunity to raise substantial funds from public investors, even while their products remain in development stages. LandSpace received 900 million yuan ($123 million) from China’s National Manufacturing Transformation and Upgrading Fund in December 2024. The company filed preliminary documents with Chinese regulators in late July, and could launch an initial public offering in early 2026. The Shanghai Stock Exchange previously changed its regulations in June to make it easier for pre-profit innovative companies to list on the STAR market . The new guidelines also prioritize companies that take up national missions or participate in major state-led space projects. LandSpace has announced plans to attempt a complete rocket recovery in mid-2026 during the second launch of its Zhuque-3 system. Aside from LandSpace, other Chinese state-owned enterprises and private companies are now rushing to test their own reusable rocket designs, with access to the capital needed for rapid development and scaling.

This move signals a profound shift in the Bitcoin mining ecosystem as operators globally confront shrinking profit margins. The company’s decision affects its entire product lineup, including the popular Antminer S19 and newer S21 series. Consequently, industry analysts view this development as a critical indicator of broader market pressures. Bitmain Mining Rigs Discount: Analyzing the Immediate Catalyst Bitmain’s discount announcement follows a sustained period of declining mining profitability. According to industry data from Cointelegraph, the current hash rate price has fallen below the minimum operational threshold for many mining operations. This metric represents the revenue generated per unit of computational power. Therefore, miners face difficult decisions about equipment upgrades and operational scaling. The company now offers significant price reductions across most inventory. Additionally, Bitmain has implemented an auction-based sales model for select products. This approach contrasts sharply with the fixed pricing typically maintained during bull markets. Historically, mining hardware manufacturers maintain stable pricing during industry expansions. However, the current market conditions necessitate aggressive inventory management. The Bitcoin network’s hash rate continues reaching new highs. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin price has remained relatively stagnant against rising energy costs. Consequently, mining efficiency becomes the paramount concern for operators. Bitmain’s response reflects these harsh economic realities. The company aims to stimulate demand during a cyclical downturn. Furthermore, this strategy helps clear existing inventory before next-generation hardware releases. Understanding the Mining Profitability Equation Bitcoin mining profitability depends on several interconnected variables. Operators must constantly calculate their break-even points. Key factors include electricity costs, hardware efficiency, network difficulty, and Bitcoin’s market price. Recently, the global average electricity price for miners has increased by approximately 18%. Simultaneously, the network difficulty has surged by over 40% in the past year. These combined pressures squeeze operator margins dramatically. The hash price metric provides the clearest profitability indicator. This value represents the expected daily revenue from one terahash per second of mining power. Currently, this figure sits near multi-year lows. The following table illustrates the changing economics for a standard mining operation: Metric 2023 Average 2025 Current Change Hash Price (USD/TH/s/day) $0.085 $0.052 -38.8% Network Difficulty 52.3T 86.7T +65.8% Global Avg. Electricity Cost (USD/kWh) $0.045 $0.053 +17.8% S19 XP Hydro Profitability (Est.) $12.50/day $4.20/day -66.4% These numbers explain the urgent need for hardware efficiency improvements. Newer mining rigs like the S21 series offer better joules per terahash ratios. However, their upfront cost previously created prohibitive capital expenditure requirements. Bitmain’s discounts directly address this barrier. The company effectively lowers the entry point for efficiency upgrades. Moreover, this move may accelerate the retirement of older, less efficient hardware globally. Such transitions typically benefit network sustainability long-term. Industry Expert Perspectives on the Strategic Shift Industry analysts interpret Bitmain’s actions through multiple lenses. Some experts view the discounts as a routine inventory cycle management tactic. Others see a strategic response to increased competition from emerging manufacturers. Companies like MicroBT and Canaan have gained market share recently. Consequently, Bitmain must defend its dominant position aggressively. The auction model introduction represents another significant development. This mechanism allows market forces to determine fair value dynamically. It also provides Bitmain with real-time demand data for production planning. Mining pool operators report increased interest in hardware upgrades following the announcement. However, they caution that discounted hardware alone cannot solve profitability challenges. Operators must secure low-cost, reliable power contracts. They must also navigate complex regulatory environments. Regions like Texas and Kazakhstan have become major mining hubs. These locations offer favorable conditions but face infrastructure and policy uncertainties. Therefore, hardware acquisition represents just one component of a successful mining strategy. The current downturn may trigger industry consolidation. Smaller operations may merge or seek acquisition by larger, better-capitalized entities. Historical Context and Market Cycle Patterns The cryptocurrency mining industry experiences pronounced cyclicality. Periods of explosive growth often follow technological breakthroughs or major Bitcoin price rallies. Conversely, extended bear markets test operator resilience and efficiency. The current situation mirrors previous downturns in 2018-2019 and 2022. During those periods, hardware manufacturers similarly offered promotions and adjusted sales tactics. However, the scale of Bitmain’s current discounting appears more comprehensive. The inclusion of flagship models like the S19 series demonstrates particular urgency. This series has represented the industry workhorse for several years. Previous cycles show that strategic hardware acquisitions during downturns can yield significant advantages. Operators who upgrade equipment during low-price periods position themselves optimally for the next expansion. Their lower capital costs translate into faster return on investment when conditions improve. Furthermore, efficient hardware provides operational flexibility during volatile energy price periods. The current discount window may therefore create a strategic buying opportunity for well-capitalized miners. However, timing the market cycle bottom remains challenging. Industry veterans emphasize focusing on long-term fundamentals rather than short-term price movements. Key considerations for operators evaluating Bitmain’s discounted rigs include: Total Cost of Ownership: Calculate purchase price plus estimated energy and maintenance costs. Hash Rate Efficiency: Compare joules per terahash across available models. Reliability and Warranty: Verify service terms and manufacturer support. Future-Proofing: Assess hardware lifespan against anticipated network difficulty increases. Resale Value: Consider secondary market demand for the specific model. Global Impact and Regional Variations Bitmain’s pricing strategy affects mining operations differently across regions. Areas with very low electricity costs, like certain parts of Latin America and the Middle East, may find the discounts particularly compelling. Their operational break-even points are lower, making efficiency upgrades more immediately profitable. Conversely, regions with high energy costs require more careful calculation. European miners, facing energy prices above $0.15/kWh in some areas, need extreme efficiency to remain viable. For them, even discounted hardware may not solve fundamental profitability issues. The discount announcement coincides with shifting geopolitical landscapes for mining. The United States has emerged as the dominant mining hub following China’s 2021 mining ban. American operators now control approximately 40% of the global hash rate. This concentration creates both opportunities and vulnerabilities. Bitmain’s discounts could further consolidate mining power among large, institutional American operators. These entities often have better access to capital and energy contracts. Meanwhile, smaller, decentralized mining operations face increasing competitive pressure. The industry’s evolving structure raises important questions about network decentralization and security. Technological Innovation and Future Hardware Developments Bitmain’s aggressive discounting may also signal impending technological transitions. The company typically reduces prices on current-generation hardware before launching new models. Industry rumors suggest next-generation 3-nanometer chip technology could arrive within 12-18 months. These chips promise another significant leap in energy efficiency. Consequently, miners must weigh discounted current technology against future advancements. Purchasing today’s hardware at lower prices makes sense if the equipment can generate positive returns before becoming obsolete. This calculation depends heavily on Bitcoin price projections and network difficulty forecasts. Manufacturers constantly balance innovation cycles with market demand. The current profitability crisis may accelerate research and development timelines. Companies need to deliver more efficient solutions to restore healthy industry margins. Beyond hardware efficiency, miners explore alternative energy sources and cooling solutions. Some operations now utilize stranded natural gas or integrate with renewable energy grids. Others implement immersion cooling technology to improve hardware longevity and performance. These innovations complement hardware advancements in the pursuit of sustainable profitability. Conclusion Bitmain’s decision to offer major discounts on mining rigs reflects deep structural challenges within the Bitcoin mining industry. The hash rate price decline below minimum profit margins has forced strategic adjustments across the ecosystem. While discounted hardware provides temporary relief for some operators, long-term solutions require broader efficiency improvements and favorable market conditions. The shift to auction-based sales models indicates a more dynamic, market-responsive approach from manufacturers. Ultimately, this period of consolidation and adjustment may strengthen the industry’s foundation. More efficient operations will emerge from this downturn, potentially benefiting the entire Bitcoin network through enhanced security and sustainability. The Bitmain mining rigs discount serves as a clear market signal, highlighting both current pressures and future transformation pathways. FAQs Q1: Why is Bitmain offering discounts on mining rigs now? Bitmain offers discounts primarily due to declining Bitcoin mining profitability. The hash rate price has fallen below many operators’ break-even points, reducing demand for new hardware. Additionally, the company likely aims to clear inventory before introducing next-generation models. Q2: Which Bitmain mining rig models are included in the discount? The discounts apply to most current products, including the widely used Antminer S19 series and the newer, more efficient S21 series. Bitmain has also moved some inventory to an auction-based sales model for dynamic pricing. Q3: How does the current mining profitability crisis affect small-scale miners? Small-scale miners face particular challenges as profit margins shrink. They often lack the capital for efficiency upgrades and may struggle with higher relative energy costs. Some may pause operations or sell equipment during this downturn. Q4: Could these discounts indicate a buying opportunity for new miners? Potentially, yes. Discounted efficient hardware lowers the entry barrier. However, new miners must carefully calculate total costs, including electricity and maintenance, against projected Bitcoin revenue. Success requires access to low-cost power and sound operational planning. Q5: What long-term impacts might this industry downturn have? The downturn will likely accelerate industry consolidation, with larger, more efficient operations gaining market share. It may also spur faster technological innovation as manufacturers compete on efficiency. Ultimately, a leaner, more resilient mining industry could emerge from this period.

The deal surfaced two days ago and landed quietly, as Cryptopolitan reported . No press release showed up. No regulatory filing followed. The only public confirmation we got later on came from a 90-word Groq blog post published after markets closed early for the holiday. Analyst Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein said that Nvidia is now so large it can close a $20 billion agreement on Christmas Eve and the market barely reacts, because really, stocks pretended not to see what’s gong on. Deal structure pulls Groq leaders and assets without a formal takeover CNBC reported that Nvidia agreed to buy selected Groq assets for $20 billion in cash, based on details shared by lead investor Alex Davis. Davis runs Disruptive and said his firm invested more than $500 million into Groq. Disruptive also led the company’s most recent funding round in September, which valued the startup at $6.9 billion. Groq said its founder and chief executive Jonathan Ross, company president Sunny Madra, and several senior leaders will join Nvidia to help scale the licensed technology. The post also stated that Groq will keep operating as an independent business. Simon Edwards, the company’s finance chief, will lead what remains of the firm. If this had been a clean acquisition, it would have been the largest in Nvidia’s 32-year history. The company’s biggest past deal was the 2019 Mellanox purchase, which came in just under $7 billion. This time, the structure looks different by design. The agreement is labeled a non-exclusive license, not a takeover. That setup follows a recent pattern across Big Tech. Companies are spending billions to bring in AI talent and hardware knowledge without triggering full merger reviews. Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have all used similar approaches. Nvidia used the same playbook in September when it paid more than $900 million to hire Enfabrica CEO Rochan Sankar and staff while licensing that startup’s technology. Cryptopolitan has analyzed that this format helps deals close faster, while also limiting direct antitrust exposure. Per data from Yahoo Finance, NVDA surged by 1.3% on Friday’s closing bell at $190.53, and the stock is up 42% this year and has climbed more than 13x since the end of 2022 when OpenAI first released ChatGPT. According to Nvidia’s last earnings report in Q3 2025, the most valuable company on earth holds $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, which is massively up from the $13.3 billion it had just 2 and a half years ago in Q3 2023. Nvidia is playing it smart with Groq deal; offense and defense Groq was founded in 2016 by former engineers, including Ross, who helped create Google’s tensor processing units, or TPUs, which some firms use instead of graphics processors. Groq focuses on inference, where AI models respond to new data. Nvidia controls most of the training side, where models learn from massive data sets. Cantor analysts said the deal lets Nvidia play offense and defense at the same time, writing that pulling Groq assets in-house prevents rivals from gaining access. The Howard Lutnick-owned company kept its buy rating and raised its price target to $300. BofA also kept a buy rating on NVDA with a $275 target, describing the Groq deal as surprising, expensive, and strategic. They also said that GPU dominance in training does not guarantee control of inference, which may need more specialized chips. Questions remain unresolved. Analysts asked who owns Groq’s language processing unit intellectual property. They also questioned whether that technology can be licensed to competitors and whether Groq’s remaining cloud business could undercut pricing tied to Nvidia’s LPU services. The next chance for public comments will likely come on Jan. 5, when Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks at CES in Las Vegas. Meanwhile, these Magnificent 7 stocks are up 27% year-to-date, following gains of 107% in 2023 and 67% in 2024. Since early 2023, their shares are up 338% and drove 45% of the S&P 500’s 18% return this year. Their combined value now sits at $21 trillion, or 34% of the index, per data from S&P Global’s Dow Jones Industrial.

He now credits the so-called “XRP Army” with playing a key role in keeping the token afloat through years of volatility, showing just how powerful a loyal holder base can be. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Needs to Bounce From $1.80 to Target $3 XRP has shed 10% of its value this year, which makes it the 4 th worst-performing token in the top 5. However, in the past 7 days, the token has recovered slightly, posting gains of 0.5% during this period. Meanwhile, trading volumes have increased by 30% in the past 24 hours, and currently account for less than 2% of the asset’s circulating market cap. Source: TradingView Once again, XRP has found strong support at $1.80. This price zone has acted as a strong bouncing pad four times already in the past. Meanwhile, a descending triangle has formed as a result of the latest price action. This is a price compression pattern that tends to precede a big breakout. If the price rises above $2.20, this would invalidate the token’s bearish price structure, and a bullish breakout of the triangle pattern would be confirmed. XRP might be eyeing $3 in the near term, especially with big names like Michael Novogratz giving credibility to its long-term vision. But if you’re looking for the next breakout opportunity, a new project is quietly turning heads.

The mess is tied to the Federal Reserve’s shrinking bond portfolio, a tightening plan that’s been in play since mid‑2022. And yes, it’s breaking things. The failed trades involved the most recently issued 10-year Treasury note. That specific batch came from a $42 billion auction held on November 12. The interest rates for lending that security collapsed so badly that some holders agreed to lend it at negative rates, meaning they gave it away cheaper than they got it back. In this type of repo transaction, settlement fails are almost guaranteed. That’s exactly what happened. Fed added less supply to the market in recent auctions Ahead of a Dec. 15 reopening of that same note, traders expected more supply to ease the pressure. That didn’t happen. Instead of the usual market relief, the reopening saw a sharp shortage. This wasn’t the regular “special” rate situation you sometimes see in repurchase agreements. This time, it was worse. And the blame goes to the Federal Reserve again. At that November auction, the Fed only took $6.5 billion worth of the notes for its own books. That’s a lot less than usual. In February, the Fed had added $11.5 billion to a similar-sized sale. In May, it took $14.8 billion, and in August, $14.3 billion. So, what changed? Here’s what changed: the Fed’s maturing Treasury holdings dropped sharply. Their System Open Market Account (SOMA) had just $22 billion maturing on Nov. 15, compared to $45 to $49 billion maturing in previous cycles. And since the Fed only reinvests maturing Treasuries above a certain cap, the amount they rolled over fell too. That cap has changed over time. Back in June 2022, the monthly cap was $30 billion. By September, it doubled to $60 billion. That tightening move directly impacted how much of each auction the Fed could touch. As a result, they didn’t step in to support the November 10-year note the way they had earlier this year. Same thing happened with three-year notes, by the way — smaller add-ons there too. This left traders scrambling to borrow a note that wasn’t widely available. Which meant more failed settlements, more headaches, and yeah, $30.5 billion worth of broken trades in just one week. Yields across Treasury curve change after holiday and strong economic data Markets came back online after the Christmas holiday, and the 10-year Treasury yield barely moved. It fell by less than one basis point, landing at 4.13%. The 2-year yield dropped over 2 basis points, ending at 3.483%. One basis point equals 0.01%, and in the bond world, yields move opposite to prices. The Treasury curve saw these changes on Friday: 1-month: 3.619% (+0.006) 3-month: 3.633% (-0.011) 6-month: 3.585% (-0.014) 1-year: 3.49% (-0.016) 2-year: 3.481% (-0.029) 10-year: 4.13% (-0.004) 30-year: 4.816% (+0.021) The moves came as traders processed fresh economic numbers. The Labor Department said jobless claims fell to 214,000 for the week ending December 20, down 10,000 from the week before. It came in below forecasts. And on top of that, the Commerce Department reported the U.S. economy grew 4.3% in Q1, marking the fastest pace in two years. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Putin Claims US Interest,https://bitcoinist.com/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-crypto-mining-putin-us/,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly said that the United States is interested in using Zaporizhzhia’s nuclear electricity for crypto mining. US & Russia Are In Talks About Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant Russia and the US are negotiating joint control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, according to a report from Kyiv Post , citing Russian business newspaper Kommersant. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is located in Southeastern Ukraine and is the largest nuclear energy facility in Europe. It used to be responsible for more than a fifth of the electricity in Ukraine, but in 2022, Russian forces captured it, and it has since ceased power generation. It would now appear that discussions have emerged about the future use of the power plant. As per the report, Vladimir Putin said at a meeting with major business figures on Christmas Eve that the US is interested in using the plant’s electricity for crypto mining and for supplying power to Ukraine. Crypto mining, the most prominent example of which is Bitcoin mining , can be an energy-intensive process, leveraging computing power to solve mathematical puzzles that allow the operator to have a chance at adding the next block to the blockchain. Crypto mining has features like portability and modularity that have made many consider its application in using waste or excess energy in power grids to produce value in the form of digital assets . On a global scale, Bitcoin mining has seen some rapid expansion during the past three years, with the Hashrate , a measure of the network’s total computing power, expanding by almost five times. Restarting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant for crypto mining, or any other purpose, however, wouldn’t be a simple task. By late 2022, all six reactors of the plant were shut down, with five of them being put in a state of cold shutdown. One reactor was kept in hot shutdown to produce steam for nuclear safety purposes. Even so, the plant isn’t in a state where a restart is possible, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). As the IAEA wrote in a press release earlier this year: Nuclear safety remains precarious at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) and its six reactors cannot be restarted as long as the military conflict continues to jeopardize the situation at the site, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi told IAEA Member States this week. Given this context, it only remains to be seen whether any reported negotiations around the nuclear power plant will actually lead it to be used for any energy-related purpose, crypto mining or otherwise.

His argument draws from the current condition of Japan’s currency environment, its longstanding collaboration with Ripple, and the need for faster cross-border payment systems in the Asian region. Japan has been navigating persistent volatility in the yen and shifts in monetary policy, which White believes could push financial institutions to seek faster settlement options. In situations where capital moves quickly, systems that reduce settlement time may prove beneficial. XRP, he said, fits this requirement due to its ability to settle transfers instantly without requiring pre-funded liquidity pools. Why Japan Could Become $XRP First Full-Scale Use Case When FX volatility spikes and the yen cracks, institutions don’t wait, they move capital fast. That’s where XRP fits in. Instant liquidity, real-time FX, and cross-border flow without pre-funding. Japan’s largest… pic.twitter.com/xgMXM4DIfR — Paul White Gold Eagle (@PaulGoldEagle) December 22, 2025 Japan’s Position in the XRP Discussion Japan stands out in the XRP adoption conversation largely because of its existing ties with Ripple through SBI Holdings . This partnership history means Japanese banks and remittance firms are likely to adopt XRP-based systems faster than others, since they’ve already worked together. White emphasized that the focus should extend beyond market price discussions and include FX stress, liquidity demands, and geopolitical influence. Japan plays a central role in capital movement across Asia, meaning inefficiencies in its currency pipeline can have wider effects. Under such circumstances, a blockchain settlement asset may serve as a neutral channel for international transfers without interfering with monetary policy. Evidence of interest already exists. In September 2023, SBI announced plans to utilize XRP for overseas fund transfers across four Asian countries, highlighting early progress in practical application rather than speculation. To evaluate the potential financial effect if Japan adopts XRP extensively, several pricing possibilities can be outlined using current market data. XRP trades around $1.87 at the time of writing. With this as a reference point, three adoption-based valuation paths are frequently discussed in industry circles. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Base Projection: $3 to $5 Range In a gradual adoption environment where financial institutions integrate XRP mainly for remittances and PHP/JPY settlements, steady usage could influence price appreciation without a supply shortage. This case assumes incremental growth and shared use with other settlement assets rather than singular dominance. Analysts at 24/7 Wall St previously forecast a price window of $3 to $4.5, citing Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD expansion in Japan as a contributing factor. Moderate Projection: $8 to $12 Range Under a scenario where Japanese corporations and banks choose XRP as their primary settlement mechanism, demand could strengthen. Corporate liquidity flows are significantly larger than those through retail remittance channels, suggesting that increased institutional participation may attract more long-term investors. In such a development, analysts consider a move toward double-digit pricing reasonable. High Projection: $15 and Above A more ambitious path assumes Japan’s usage model becomes a benchmark for neighboring markets, encouraging broader Asian integration. To support this outcome, regulatory clarity, deep liquidity reserves, and high-frequency transactional demand would be necessary. Although this is a less conservative assumption, advocates believe regional adoption could reflect structural valuation growth over time. The central takeaway is that future performance for XRP depends primarily on operational deployment rather than short-term speculation. Japan offers a distinct landscape due to its progressive stance on crypto regulation, its economic scale, and existing collaborations with Ripple. Should institutional adoption expand, XRP could transition from a speculative digital asset to a functional element within financial infrastructure. However, these scenarios remain projections rather than confirmed outcomes. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Bitcoin Supply Overhang Could Dictate Volatility & Selling Pressure As pointed out by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, over 6.6 million BTC is being held above the latest spot price of the cryptocurrency. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the “Supply In Loss,” which measures, as its name suggests, the total amount of Bitcoin that’s currently carrying some net unrealized loss. Related Reading: Bitcoin Extreme Fear Streak Extends To 13 Days On Christmas The metric works by going through the transaction history of each token in circulation to determine the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. If this previous transfer price was more than the current spot price for any coin, then that particular token is considered to be in a state of loss. The Supply In Loss adds up all coins fulfilling this condition to find the total situation on the network. A counterpart indicator called the Supply In Profit accounts for the supply of the opposite type. Now, here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Supply In Loss over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Supply In Loss shrunk to a value of zero as the asset’s price set its all-time high (ATH) above $126,000 back in October, but with the market downturn that has followed since then, the indicator’s value has shot up. Today, around 6.6 million tokens of the cryptocurrency sit below cost basis, equivalent to a third of the BTC supply in circulation. The recent highs in the Supply In Loss represent the highest degree of pain in the market since 2023. In another X post, the analyst has shared the chart for another Bitcoin indicator, this one called the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD). The URPD contains information about how much BTC was bought last at each of the levels that the asset has visited in its history. Looks like a significant portion of the supply sits above the spot price | Source: @JA_Maartun on X From the chart of the URPD, it’s visible how the Bitcoin supply that’s in loss is distributed across the various levels right now. A few levels are particularly prominent in the degree of supply that they carry, while some others are notably thin with coins. Generally, investors who are in loss look forward to a retest of their cost basis so that they can get their money “back.” Once this happens, some of these hands decide to exit, fearing that BTC will go down again in the near future. This selling can make large supply clusters above the spot price, potential points of volatility.

This dramatic divergence in institutional strategy, reported by blockchain analytics firm Onchainlens in March 2025, reveals critical insights into the evolving landscape of proof-of-stake validation and corporate crypto treasury management. The contrasting moves by these two significant players highlight the complex risk-reward calculations now dominating institutional cryptocurrency investment decisions. Bitmain’s Major Ethereum Staking Move Analyzed Bitmain’s decision to stake 74,880 ETH represents one of the largest single institutional commitments to Ethereum staking since The Merge transitioned the network to proof-of-stake consensus. The Beijing-based company, historically dominant in Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturing, began accumulating this substantial position over several months according to on-chain data analysis. This strategic pivot toward Ethereum validation signals a fundamental diversification beyond their traditional proof-of-work expertise. Furthermore, the timing coincides with broader institutional adoption trends in cryptocurrency staking products. Industry analysts immediately noted several key implications from Bitmain’s move. First, the commitment demonstrates substantial confidence in Ethereum’s long-term network security and economic model. Second, the scale suggests sophisticated treasury management strategies are becoming standard among crypto-native corporations. Third, the accumulation period indicates deliberate, price-conscious acquisition rather than speculative timing. Blockchain data reveals the ETH was sourced from multiple exchanges and private wallets, suggesting a coordinated accumulation strategy designed to minimize market impact. The Technical Mechanics of Large-Scale Staking Executing a stake of this magnitude requires significant technical infrastructure. Each Ethereum validator requires a 32 ETH deposit, meaning Bitmain’s position represents approximately 2,340 individual validator nodes. Managing this validator fleet demands robust server infrastructure, sophisticated monitoring systems, and dedicated technical personnel. The company likely utilizes either enterprise-grade staking services or has developed proprietary validation infrastructure. This operational commitment underscores the professionalization of institutional staking, moving far beyond retail participation through simple exchange interfaces. Shapelink’s Simultaneous $100 Million ETH Unstaking While Bitmain entered the staking arena, blockchain infrastructure provider Shapelink initiated the unstaking of 35,627 ETH valued at approximately $100 million. This substantial withdrawal represents a significant reduction in their Ethereum network participation. On-chain analysis indicates the unstaking process occurred through multiple transactions over a 48-hour period, suggesting planned treasury reallocation rather than emergency liquidity needs. The company, known for providing node infrastructure services across multiple blockchain networks, has not publicly commented on the strategic rationale behind this move. Market observers have proposed several plausible explanations for Shapelink’s decision. Some analysts suggest portfolio rebalancing toward other blockchain investments or traditional assets. Others speculate about potential strategic shifts in their business model away from infrastructure provision. The unstaking coincides with the full unlocking period post-Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade, which enabled validator withdrawals for the first time. This timing allows institutional players to re-evaluate their staking commitments with newfound flexibility previously unavailable in the locked staking era. Comparative Analysis of Institutional Staking Moves Metric Bitmain Shapelink Transaction Type Staking Deposit Withdrawal Request ETH Amount 74,880 ETH 35,627 ETH USD Value (March 2025) $210 Million $100 Million Validator Equivalents ~2,340 Nodes ~1,114 Nodes Timeframe Multi-month Accumulation 48-hour Execution Network Impact Increased Security Reduced Participation Broader Implications for Ethereum’s Staking Ecosystem These contrasting transactions occur within a rapidly evolving staking landscape. Ethereum’s total staked ETH recently surpassed 30% of circulating supply, representing over $100 billion in committed value. The entry of major institutional players like Bitmain accelerates several important trends: Professionalization of Validation: Large-scale operators bring enterprise-grade security and reliability practices. Increased Network Decentralization: New institutional validators diversify the validator set beyond early stakers. Liquidity Management Evolution: The ability to enter and exit positions influences corporate treasury strategies. Yield Competition: Institutional participation may compress staking yields over time through increased competition. Simultaneously, exits like Shapelink’s demonstrate the maturing liquidity options available to institutional stakers. The unstaking process, once requiring weeks for queue processing, now operates with predictable timelines thanks to protocol improvements. This liquidity flexibility makes staking more attractive to corporate treasuries that require asset accessibility alongside yield generation. Regulatory and Compliance Considerations Institutional staking activities increasingly navigate complex regulatory environments. Different jurisdictions treat staking rewards as interest income, capital gains, or business income for tax purposes. Large-scale operators like Bitmain must implement robust compliance frameworks including: Transaction monitoring for anti-money laundering requirements Accurate reward reporting for tax authorities Geographic restrictions based on regulatory permissions Corporate structure optimization for liability protection These compliance burdens create barriers to entry that may concentrate institutional staking among well-resourced players. However, they also legitimize the activity for traditional financial institutions considering cryptocurrency exposure. The transparent on-chain nature of these transactions provides regulators with unprecedented visibility into institutional crypto activities compared to traditional financial markets. Historical Context and Market Cycle Analysis Bitmain’s substantial ETH accumulation follows a challenging period for mining companies after Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake. The company previously derived significant revenue from Ethereum mining hardware sales before The Merge rendered those products obsolete. Their pivot to staking represents a strategic adaptation to fundamental blockchain protocol changes. Historical data shows mining companies have successfully transitioned to validation services in previous cycles, though rarely at this scale or velocity. Market cycle analysis reveals institutional staking activity often increases during periods of network maturity and regulatory clarity. The current phase follows several key developments: Ethereum’s successful transition to proof-of-stake consensus (September 2022) Implementation of validator withdrawals (April 2023) Growing institutional custody solutions for staked assets (2023-2024) Clearer regulatory guidance in major jurisdictions (2024-2025) These developments have created what analysts term the “institutional staking infrastructure” necessary for large-scale participation. The contrasting moves by Bitmain and Shapelink demonstrate how different institutions interpret the same market conditions through divergent strategic lenses. Conclusion The simultaneous Bitmain ETH staking and Shapelink unstaking transactions reveal a maturing institutional cryptocurrency landscape where sophisticated players execute billion-dollar strategies with precision timing. Bitmain’s $210 million commitment signals strong confidence in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake future and represents a strategic diversification beyond their mining heritage. Meanwhile, Shapelink’s $100 million exit demonstrates the liquidity flexibility now available to institutional stakers, enabling dynamic portfolio management. Together, these contrasting moves highlight the complex risk-reward calculations dominating institutional crypto investment in 2025, with Ethereum staking emerging as a critical arena for corporate treasury strategies and blockchain infrastructure commitments. FAQs Q1: What does staking mean in the context of Ethereum? Staking refers to the process of depositing ETH to activate validator software that processes transactions and creates new blocks on the Ethereum blockchain. Validators earn rewards for securing the network while their staked ETH serves as collateral against malicious behavior. Q2: Why would a company like Bitmain stake such a large amount of ETH? Companies stake ETH to generate yield on their cryptocurrency holdings while simultaneously supporting network security. For Bitmain specifically, this represents diversification from their traditional mining business and positions them within Ethereum’s growing proof-of-stake ecosystem. Q3: How does unstaking work on Ethereum? Since the Shanghai upgrade, validators can initiate withdrawal requests that enter a queue. After processing, staked ETH and accumulated rewards become available in the validator’s designated withdrawal address, typically within days depending on network activity. Q4: What impact do large institutional moves have on Ethereum’s network security? Bitmain’s staking increases the total value securing the network, making attacks more expensive. However, concentration among large validators presents decentralization concerns that the Ethereum community actively monitors and addresses through protocol improvements. Q5: Are staking rewards considered taxable income? Tax treatment varies by jurisdiction, but most countries consider staking rewards as taxable income at the time of receipt. Institutional stakers like Bitmain must implement robust accounting systems to track and report these rewards according to local regulations.

Despite this incremental rise, the index firmly remains entrenched in the “Extreme Fear” category, a persistent state that has defined market sentiment for much of the recent quarter. This data, sourced from Alternative.me on April 10, 2025, presents a complex picture of a market grappling with volatility while searching for a sustainable foundation. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Rise to 23 The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial barometer for the emotional temperature of the digital asset space. Consequently, its movement from 20 to 23, while minor, warrants detailed examination. The index operates on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies “Extreme Fear” and 100 represents “Extreme Greed.” Therefore, a reading of 23 places the market deep within the fear-dominated zone, specifically between 0 and 25. This metric synthesizes data from six core components, each weighted to reflect its impact on collective sentiment. Volatility (25%): This component analyzes price swings, particularly for Bitcoin. Notably, reduced volatility often contributes to a higher index score. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This factor examines trading volume and overall market momentum. Significantly, higher volume with positive price action typically boosts the index. Social Media (15%): Sentiment analysis on platforms like Twitter and Reddit gauges public conversation tone and volume. Surveys (15%): Periodic polls of the cryptocurrency community provide direct insight into investor expectations. Dominance (10%): Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap is a key stability indicator. Trends (10%): Google search volume for “Bitcoin” and related terms reflects mainstream interest and curiosity. The three-point increase likely stems from modest improvements across several of these inputs. For instance, a stabilization in Bitcoin’s price band or a slight uptick in trading volume could trigger the change. However, the overarching “Extreme Fear” classification underscores that these improvements remain fragile and nascent. Historical Context and Market Sentiment Analysis To fully grasp the significance of a score of 23, we must place it within a historical framework. The index has experienced dramatic swings throughout cryptocurrency’s history. For example, it plummeted to single digits during the March 2020 COVID-19 market crash and again following major industry collapses in 2022. Conversely, it soared above 90 during the euphoric peaks of late 2017 and late 2021. Currently, the market’s prolonged residence in “Extreme Fear” contrasts sharply with those periods of unchecked optimism. This persistent fear often correlates with specific market behaviors. Investors typically exhibit risk aversion, favoring stablecoins or off-ramping to fiat currency. Moreover, leveraged positions decrease, and funding rates in perpetual swap markets may turn negative. Importantly, seasoned analysts frequently interpret prolonged fear as a potential contrarian indicator. Historically, accumulation by long-term holders often accelerates during these phases, setting the stage for future rallies when sentiment eventually pivots. Expert Insight on Sentiment as a Lagging Indicator Market strategists and behavioral finance experts emphasize that sentiment indices like the Fear & Greed Index are often lagging, not leading, indicators. “Sentiment reflects the pain or joy of recent price action,” notes Dr. Anya Sharma, a financial psychologist at the Digital Asset Research Institute. “A move from 20 to 23 doesn’t forecast a bull market. Instead, it confirms that the intense selling pressure and negative news flow of the prior weeks may be abating slightly. The market is catching its breath, not necessarily preparing to run.” This perspective is crucial for investors who might misinterpret a small rise as an all-clear signal. The 2025 Regulatory and Macroeconomic Landscape The current sentiment cannot be divorced from the broader environment of 2025. Several key factors continue to exert pressure on investor psychology. First, the global macroeconomic picture remains uncertain, with central banks navigating a complex path between inflation control and economic growth. Higher interest rates have traditionally dampened appetite for speculative assets like cryptocurrency. Second, the regulatory landscape for digital assets is still crystallizing in major economies like the United States and the European Union. While clarity is ultimately positive, the process creates short-term uncertainty. Third, the industry continues to mature post-2022, with a heightened focus on institutional infrastructure, proof-of-reserves, and compliance. This maturation is fundamentally healthy but occurs alongside a decline in the retail speculation that previously drove sentiment to extreme greed. The table below summarizes the primary forces influencing the Fear & Greed Index in the current climate. Factor Impact on Sentiment (2025) Likely Effect on Index Macroeconomic Uncertainty Negative Pressure Pulls score toward Fear Ongoing Regulatory Development Mixed (Uncertainty vs. Clarity) Creates volatility in score Industry Maturation & Institutional Adoption Long-term Positive, Short-term Neutral Provides a floor, limiting extreme fear Reduced Retail Leverage & Speculation Reduces Volatility Can stabilize score, prevent wild swings Practical Implications for Cryptocurrency Investors For market participants, the index provides a valuable tool for emotional discipline. A reading in Extreme Fear suggests that panic selling may be prevalent, potentially creating buying opportunities for those with a long-term horizon and robust risk management. Conversely, it also signals that a swift, sustained recovery is not immediately guaranteed. Investors should use the index not as a standalone trading signal but as one piece of a comprehensive analysis puzzle that includes on-chain data, fundamental project health, and macroeconomic trends. Furthermore, the index’s multi-factor composition reminds us that market sentiment is multifaceted. A rise driven by increased social media volume differs fundamentally from a rise driven by surging Bitcoin dominance. Therefore, savvy observers look beyond the headline number to the underlying components for a more nuanced understanding of the market’s drivers. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s ascent to 23 represents a faint heartbeat in a market still diagnosed with Extreme Fear. This minor improvement reflects tentative stabilization rather than a decisive shift in trend. The index remains a critical gauge of market psychology, deeply influenced by volatility, volume, and social discourse. In the context of 2025’s evolving regulatory and macroeconomic landscape, understanding this sentiment metric is more important than ever for navigating the complex cryptocurrency ecosystem. While the climb from 20 to 23 offers a glimmer of hope, the predominant narrative remains one of caution, underscoring the market’s ongoing journey toward stability and maturity. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 23 mean? A score of 23 indicates the market is in a state of “Extreme Fear,” though it shows a slight improvement from a lower reading. It suggests investor sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, often associated with panic selling or high risk aversion, but may be stabilizing at a low level. Q2: How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? The index is calculated using six weighted factors: volatility (25%), market momentum and volume (25%), social media sentiment (15%), surveys (15%), Bitcoin’s market dominance (10%), and Google search trends (10%). These are combined to produce a single score from 0 to 100. Q3: Is Extreme Fear a good time to buy cryptocurrency? Historically, periods of Extreme Fear have sometimes preceded market recoveries, as prices may be depressed. However, it is not a guaranteed buy signal. Extreme Fear can persist, and prices may fall further. It should be considered alongside fundamental analysis and personal risk tolerance. Q4: How often does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index update? The index updates daily, providing a near real-time snapshot of market sentiment based on the previous 24 hours of data across its various sources. Q5: What is the difference between fear and greed in market sentiment? Fear drives selling, risk-off behavior, and capital preservation, often leading to undervalued assets. Greed drives buying, excessive risk-taking, and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), often leading to asset bubbles and overvaluation. The index measures the balance between these two emotions.

The China-based company adopted this decision after observing the challenges faced in the mining industry. In a statement, TheMinerMag, a specialized digital publication and data platform focused primarily on the Bitcoin mining industry, among other fields, announced that Bitmain has started offering bundle deals and discounts covering various models. Some of these models include the company’s Antminer S19 and S21 series of application-specific integrated circuit mining machines. In early 2025, these series machines would have been perceived as “distressed sales,” that is, when the price of BTC was increasing. Uncertainties surrounding the mining industry sparks tension in the sector Following TheMinerMag’s report, sources pointed out that even the recently launched top-quality mining hardware, such as the S21 immersion-cooled ASICs, is being set for sale with discounts of about $7 per terahash-second (TH/s). What caught many by surprise was recently released news that highlighted that some bundles were actually auctioned off to miners who were given the chance to choose their preferred prices freely. These recent price reductions occurred during one of the most challenging periods for profit margins in the mining industry, according to reports. An example supported this point. In this case, it highlighted the present state experienced in the hashprice. According to the situation, the hashprice, a key Bitcoin mining metric showing the expected daily dollar revenue per unit of hashing power (TH/s or PH/s), has reportedly dropped to a low experienced in years of about $35 per terahash/second per day (TH/s/day). Concerning this finding, it is worth noting that a margin of $40 per TH/s/day is widely recognized as the break-even point for miners. Such a scenario prompts several operators to consider closing down their operations until they are certain that the economic conditions have improved. Meanwhile, reports have noted that the current situation highlights a significant economic challenge in the mining sector, which is reportedly highly competitive even under ideal circumstances. For instance, the sector is facing a decline in the Bitcoin market, price increases for energy, regulatory challenges, and risks associated with the supply chain. To address this situation, the mining firms joined forces to look for other effective solutions. One of the proposed solutions is that the companies are considering renewable energy to cut costs after the halving event in April 2024. This event reduced the block reward to 3.125 Bitcoin per block. Analysts express disappointment after noting 2025 as an amazing year for BTC Regarding the mining companies’ consideration, sources mentioned that the smaller block reward normally gets offset by the surge in Bitcoin’s price every four years. Nonetheless, 2025 came to a disappointing end, despite being anticipated as a remarkable year for the cryptocurrency industry. During the year, the price declined drastically from a peak of more than $126,000, recorded in October, to a low point of around $80,000 in November. Currently, reports from CoinMarketCap indicate that the price of BTC is over 7% lower than its record on January 1 of this year. Additionally, it is around 20% below its highest point of more than $109,000 recorded on January 20. Notably, this record was observed during the day of US President Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

This crucial metric, a barometer for market cycle phases, provides a stark and data-driven snapshot of current capital flows. Consequently, understanding this index offers vital context for portfolio strategy and risk assessment during a complex market phase. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index and Its Steady Reading CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index serves as a primary gauge for market sentiment between Bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies. The platform calculates this index by analyzing the 90-day price performance of the top 100 digital assets by market capitalization. Importantly, the calculation excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to focus purely on speculative assets. An official “altcoin season” triggers only if 75% of these top coins outperform Bitcoin during the measured period. Therefore, a score of 16 remains profoundly distant from the threshold of 100, which would indicate overwhelming altcoin strength. This persistent low score underscores a market narrative still heavily centered on Bitcoin’s performance. Historical Context and Market Cycle Analysis Examining historical data reveals clear patterns. Previous bull markets, notably in 2017 and 2021, witnessed the Altcoin Season Index soaring above 75 for sustained periods. During those epochs, capital rapidly rotated from Bitcoin into smaller-cap assets, chasing higher returns. Conversely, the current stagnation at 16 aligns more closely with consolidation or accumulation phases that typically follow major market corrections. For instance, similar index levels were observed in late 2019 before the subsequent market run. This historical parallel provides a framework for analysts to evaluate potential future trajectories, though past performance never guarantees future results. Expert Analysis on Capital Rotation and Investor Psychology Market analysts emphasize that the index reflects deeper capital allocation trends. “A low Altcoin Season Index fundamentally indicates risk-off sentiment or a preference for liquidity,” explains a report from a major blockchain analytics firm. “Investors often retreat to Bitcoin, perceived as digital gold, during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty or regulatory scrutiny.” This behavioral pattern was evident throughout 2023 and into 2024, as traditional finance interest via Bitcoin ETFs solidified its flagship status. Meanwhile, altcoin projects must demonstrate substantial utility or technological breakthroughs to attract capital away from the market leader. The Technical Mechanics Behind the Index Calculation The methodology is rigorous and transparent. First, CoinMarketCap compiles the list of the top 100 coins. Next, it filters out assets designed for price stability. Then, it performs a direct 90-day return comparison for each remaining asset against Bitcoin. Finally, it calculates the percentage that outperformed. This process yields the single-figure index. The 90-day window is strategic; it smooths out short-term volatility while capturing medium-term trend shifts. For traders, this creates a reliable, albeit lagging, indicator of market regime change. Data Set: Top 100 coins by market cap. Exclusions: Stablecoins (USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (wBTC). Time Frame: Rolling 90-day performance period. Benchmark: Bitcoin’s (BTC) price performance. Threshold: 75% outperformance required for “season.” Broader Market Implications and Sector Performance The steady index reading does not imply uniform stagnation across all altcoins. Indeed, specific sectors like decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) or real-world asset (RWA) tokenization have shown isolated strength. However, these movements remain insufficient to move the aggregate index significantly. The broader implication is clear: market-wide, risk capital remains cautious. Major catalysts like Ethereum ETF approvals or definitive regulatory clarity could serve as potential triggers for index movement. Until then, the market appears to be in a holding pattern, building a base for the next cycle. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index holding at 16 delivers a unambiguous message about the current cryptocurrency market structure. Bitcoin dominance persists, reflecting a cautious macro environment and a maturation phase for the broader digital asset class. For investors, this index provides a critical, objective tool to gauge market cycles beyond mere price speculation. Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index for a sustained break above 50 will be essential for signaling a genuine shift in momentum toward alternative cryptocurrencies. FAQs Q1: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 16 mean? An index value of 16 means only a small percentage (roughly 16%) of the top altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the prior 90 days. It indicates a market strongly dominated by Bitcoin’s performance. Q2: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? CoinMarketCap updates the Altcoin Season Index daily, providing a near real-time view of the changing performance dynamics between Bitcoin and major alternative cryptocurrencies. Q3: Has the crypto market ever experienced a true “altcoin season”? Yes, historically. During major bull markets, the index has exceeded 75 for prolonged periods, notably in 2017-2018 and 2021, when capital flooded into altcoins, generating extraordinary returns. Q4: Can the index predict future price movements? The index is a descriptive lagging indicator, not a predictive tool. It confirms a trend that is already in place. However, a sustained rise above key levels can signal a changing market regime that may continue. Q5: Why are stablecoins excluded from the Altcoin Season Index calculation? Stablecoins are excluded because they are designed to maintain a peg to a fiat currency and do not exhibit speculative price appreciation. Their inclusion would distort the measurement of risk-on capital rotation into volatile assets.

Long periods of dominance, followed by a phase where growth slows and attention begins to drift elsewhere. It does not happen overnight. It starts quietly, with capital scanning for opportunities that look less crowded and more flexible. That is the context behind recent conversations pointing toward a $0.035 new cryptocurrency. For those asking what crypto to buy now ahead of 2026, this shift is becoming easier to understand. Rather than abandoning Bitcoin, many early holders are simply looking to complement it. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin remains the largest and most recognized cryptocurrency in the world. Its market cap sits far above every other digital asset, and its role as a store of value is firmly established. Early investors benefited enormously as BTC moved from double digits to five figures. Today, Bitcoin faces a different challenge. Price action has struggled to move decisively beyond the $100K zone. Market commentators often describe this level as a major resistance area. Breaking above it requires sustained inflows of capital on a massive scale. Some analysts believe that even in a positive scenario, Bitcoin’s upside into 2026 may be limited compared to earlier cycles. Projections often point to modest multiples rather than dramatic growth. A 1.5x or 2x move from current levels would still be significant in absolute terms, but it does not compare to the kind of returns early Bitcoin investors once experienced. This is why some long-term holders are now exploring smaller cryptocurrency projects that offer higher upside potential from lower starting points. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Trying to Build That search has brought Mutuum Finance (MUTM) into focus. Mutuum Finance is a DeFi crypto designed to build a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol focused on real usage rather than short-term attention. The goal is straightforward. Allow users to supply assets, earn yield, and borrow against collateral in a system that adjusts automatically based on market conditions. Instead of fixed incentives, the protocol relies on utilization to balance liquidity and demand. According to official statements shared on X, V1 of the Mutuum Finance lending and borrowing protocol is planned for the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. Core features include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an automated liquidator bot. Initial supported assets will be ETH and USDT. Presale Progress and Why It Matters While early Bitcoin investors are known for patience, they also pay close attention to numbers. Mutuum Finance’s presale has shown steady growth since early 2025. The current token price is $0.035, and participation has expanded consistently rather than suddenly. So far, the project has raised $19.45M, with 18,650 holders taking part. A total of 825M tokens have already been sold. From a fixed 4B total supply, 45.5% is allocated to the presale, which equals roughly 1.82B tokens. Phase 6 of the presale is now over 99% allocated, meaning supply at the current price is almost gone. The official launch price is set at $0.06, which has shaped many of the current growth discussions.. In addition, MUTM is positioned as a utility token within the ecosystem. It is designed to be used for protocol-related interactions, which some analysts believe strengthens long-term demand compared to purely speculative assets. Why Bitcoin Investors Are Paying Attention Bitcoin early adopters tend to look for asymmetric opportunities. These are situations where downside is defined, but upside remains open. Mutuum Finance fits that profile more closely than large-cap assets at this stage. At $0.035, the entry point is still low relative to the planned launch price. Some analysts believe that if adoption develops as expected, MUTM could see 200% to 300% growth shortly after launch. In more optimistic scenarios tied to usage, exchange visibility, and supply dynamics, projections show up to 600% growth into 2026. This is not framed as a certainty. It is a model based on execution and timing. Still, it helps explain why experienced Bitcoin investors are starting to watch this new cryptocurrency more closely. Stablecoin Plans and Oracle Infrastructure Beyond lending and borrowing, Mutuum Finance plans to introduce a stablecoin backed by multiple assets. This design allows borrowers to use diverse collateral rather than relying on a single token. By spreading risk, the system can remain more stable during volatile market conditions. Accurate pricing is essential for any lending protocol. Mutuum Finance’s design anticipates the use of decentralized oracle feeds such as Chainlink, along with fallback and aggregated data sources. These feeds help ensure fair collateral valuation and reliable liquidation triggers. Market commentators suggest that strong oracle infrastructure is often overlooked, yet critical. In a bullish scenario, analysts believe that combining lending, a stablecoin, and reliable price data can support broader adoption over time. The Bigger Picture Security is another area that matters to long-term investors. Mutuum Finance has completed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 token scan score, providing an early layer of confidence. An independent audit with Halborn Security is currently in progress, reviewing finalized lending and borrowing contracts. The project has also launched a $50k bug bounty focused on identifying code vulnerabilities. This proactive approach is often viewed positively by analysts, especially those comparing new cryptocurrency projects against established standards. Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of the cryptocurrency market. Its role is not in question. What is changing is how investors allocate around it. As BTC faces resistance near $100K and its growth profile matures, attention naturally shifts toward projects with earlier-stage potential. Mutuum Finance, priced at $0.035 and nearing the end of Phase 6, represents that kind of opportunity. With a V1 launch planned, strong presale participation, stablecoin development, and multiple security layers, it is entering a phase where early positioning becomes more difficult to find.

56425026,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=254563,1766797211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Pantera Capital’s Strategic $15.39M Ethereum Deposit to Coinbase Prime Reveals Calculated Institutional Move,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/pantera-capital-ethereum-coinbase-deposit/,"BitcoinWorld Pantera Capital’s Strategic $15.39M Ethereum Deposit to Coinbase Prime Reveals Calculated Institutional Move In a significant blockchain transaction capturing institutional attention, two addresses linked to prominent investment firm Pantera Capital deposited 5,264 Ethereum tokens worth $15.39 million to Coinbase Prime this week, according to verified on-chain data from Onchainlens. This substantial movement of digital assets represents one of the most noteworthy institutional cryptocurrency transactions of early 2025, potentially signaling strategic portfolio adjustments amid evolving market conditions. The transaction occurred against a backdrop of regulatory clarity and institutional adoption milestones that have characterized the cryptocurrency landscape throughout the past year. Pantera Capital’s Ethereum Transaction Analysis The blockchain data reveals precise transaction details that merit careful examination. Onchainlens, a respected blockchain analytics platform, identified the two Ethereum addresses through their transaction patterns and historical connections to Pantera Capital’s known wallet activities. The 5,264 ETH transfer represents approximately 0.004% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply, making it a substantial but not market-moving transaction by volume standards. The deposit reached Coinbase Prime, the exchange’s institutional platform designed specifically for high-net-worth individuals, family offices, and corporate entities seeking sophisticated cryptocurrency services. Transaction timing provides crucial context for understanding this movement. The deposit occurred during a period of relative stability in Ethereum’s price, which has maintained a trading range between $2,800 and $3,200 throughout the first quarter of 2025. Market analysts immediately noted several possible interpretations of this transaction. Some experts suggest the move represents routine portfolio rebalancing, while others speculate it could signal preparation for upcoming Ethereum network developments or regulatory considerations affecting institutional holdings. Institutional Cryptocurrency Strategy Evolution Pantera Capital’s transaction history reveals patterns worth noting. The firm, founded in 2013 by Dan Morehead, has established itself as one of the earliest and most successful cryptocurrency-focused investment firms. Their portfolio strategy typically combines long-term holdings with tactical adjustments based on market conditions and technological developments. Previous blockchain analyses show Pantera maintaining significant Ethereum positions since 2017, with periodic adjustments during major market cycles and protocol upgrades. Institutional cryptocurrency custody options have expanded dramatically since 2023. The table below illustrates the progression: Year Primary Custody Method Notable Developments 2021-2022 Self-custody solutions Institutions managed private keys internally 2023 Hybrid approaches Combination of exchanges and specialized custodians 2024-2025 Regulated prime services Platforms like Coinbase Prime offering insured custody Market Impact and Broader Implications The cryptocurrency market responds to institutional movements with particular sensitivity. Large transactions from recognized entities like Pantera Capital often trigger analysis across trading desks and investment committees worldwide. Market data from the past 72 hours shows several related developments. First, Ethereum’s trading volume increased by approximately 18% following the transaction’s public reporting. Second, options market activity indicates heightened interest in Ethereum derivatives, particularly call options with strike prices above $3,500 for quarterly expirations. Several factors make this transaction particularly noteworthy in early 2025. Regulatory developments have created clearer frameworks for institutional cryptocurrency holdings. The SEC’s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in late 2024 established new pathways for traditional finance integration. Additionally, Ethereum’s ongoing transition to a fully proof-of-stake consensus mechanism has progressed through several successful upgrades, reducing environmental concerns that previously limited institutional participation. Expert Perspectives on Institutional Movements Industry analysts offer varied interpretations of this transaction. Blockchain forensic specialists emphasize the technical aspects. “The movement to Coinbase Prime suggests preparation for potential trading activity or secure custody arrangements,” notes Dr. Elena Rodriguez, a blockchain researcher at Stanford’s Digital Asset Lab. “Institutional players increasingly utilize prime brokerage services for their operational efficiency and regulatory compliance features.” Market strategists consider broader implications. “This transaction size represents meaningful but not extraordinary position adjustment,” observes Michael Chen, chief investment officer at Digital Wealth Management. “The more significant story is the continued institutional engagement with Ethereum despite recent volatility and regulatory scrutiny.” Historical data supports this perspective. Institutional Ethereum holdings have grown steadily since 2023, with quarterly inflows averaging $850 million across regulated platforms. Technical and Operational Considerations Blockchain technology enables unprecedented transaction transparency. The Ethereum blockchain records every transaction with timestamp, amount, and wallet addresses. Analysis of the two sending addresses reveals several characteristics. Both addresses show patterns consistent with institutional rather than individual ownership. They maintained substantial Ethereum balances for extended periods, engaged in relatively infrequent transactions, and previously interacted with known institutional service providers. Coinbase Prime’s institutional features likely influenced this deposit decision. The platform offers several advantages for large-scale cryptocurrency holders: Enhanced security protocols exceeding standard exchange protections Insurance coverage for digital asset custody Direct market access with improved liquidity options Regulatory compliance frameworks meeting institutional requirements Advanced reporting tools for portfolio management and auditing Transaction mechanics followed standard Ethereum protocol procedures. The transfer required payment of gas fees, which averaged 35 gwei during the transaction window, resulting in approximately $42 in network fees. The transaction confirmation occurred within two minutes, demonstrating Ethereum’s improved scalability following recent network upgrades. Historical Context and Pattern Recognition Pantera Capital’s cryptocurrency strategy has evolved through multiple market cycles. The firm initially focused primarily on Bitcoin during cryptocurrency’s early institutional adoption phase. Their portfolio diversification into Ethereum began in earnest during 2017, coinciding with growing recognition of smart contract platforms’ potential. Previous blockchain analyses reveal pattern consistency in their transaction behavior. Pantera typically makes substantial movements during periods of technical transition or regulatory milestone events. The current transaction fits within established behavioral patterns. Similar movements occurred before major Ethereum upgrades, including the Merge transition to proof-of-stake in 2022 and subsequent Shanghai upgrade enabling staking withdrawals. Market conditions in early 2025 present several parallels to previous adjustment periods. Ethereum’s price has consolidated following a 2024 rally, network activity has stabilized after period of high volatility, and regulatory frameworks have reached new clarity levels. Regulatory Environment and Compliance Factors Institutional cryptocurrency transactions increasingly consider regulatory dimensions. The 2025 regulatory landscape differs substantially from previous years. Clearer classification of digital assets, established custody requirements, and reporting standards have emerged across major jurisdictions. These developments reduce uncertainty for institutional participants like Pantera Capital. Compliance considerations likely influenced the Coinbase Prime deposit decision, as regulated platforms provide documented compliance with evolving standards. Tax implications represent another consideration. Large cryptocurrency movements trigger reporting requirements under current regulations. Institutional investors must document transaction purposes, cost basis calculations, and potential tax liabilities. The timing of this transaction, occurring early in the calendar year, may facilitate streamlined accounting and reporting processes for the firm’s 2025 financial activities. Conclusion Pantera Capital’s $15.39 million Ethereum deposit to Coinbase Prime represents a significant institutional cryptocurrency transaction with multiple potential interpretations. The movement highlights continued institutional engagement with digital assets amid evolving market conditions and regulatory frameworks. While the specific motivation behind this transaction remains known only to Pantera’s investment committee, the observable patterns suggest strategic positioning rather than reactive trading. This transaction reinforces Ethereum’s status as a core institutional holding within diversified cryptocurrency portfolios. As blockchain transparency enables detailed transaction analysis, market participants gain valuable insights into institutional strategies and market dynamics. The Pantera Capital Ethereum deposit ultimately demonstrates the maturation of cryptocurrency markets and the sophisticated approaches institutional investors now employ within this asset class. FAQs Q1: What is Coinbase Prime and how does it differ from regular Coinbase? Coinbase Prime is a specialized platform designed for institutional investors, offering enhanced security, dedicated customer support, advanced trading tools, and compliance features tailored to large-scale cryptocurrency transactions and custody needs. Q2: How do analysts link blockchain addresses to specific institutions like Pantera Capital? Blockchain analysts use pattern recognition, transaction history analysis, and sometimes publicly disclosed information to establish connections between wallet addresses and known entities, though absolute certainty requires direct confirmation from the institutions themselves. Q3: What percentage of Ethereum’s total supply does this transaction represent? The 5,264 ETH transfer represents approximately 0.004% of Ethereum’s circulating supply, making it substantial for an individual transaction but not large enough to significantly impact overall market liquidity or price discovery mechanisms. Q4: Why would an institution move cryptocurrency to an exchange rather than keeping it in cold storage? Institutions may transfer assets to exchanges for several reasons including preparation for trading activity, utilization of institutional services like lending or staking, enhanced security through insured custody, or compliance with regulatory requirements for certain types of holdings. Q5: How has institutional cryptocurrency custody evolved in recent years? Custody solutions have progressed from basic self-custody to sophisticated institutional-grade services offering insurance, regulatory compliance, advanced security protocols, and integration with traditional financial systems, reducing barriers to institutional participation.

XRP Forecasts Dipped A recent poll conducted by cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, running from December 12 to 23, reveals that 73% of investors predict XRP will finish the year between $1.50 and $2.00, suggesting a muted conclusion for the altcoin’s performance in 2025. Just weeks prior, market sentiment was more optimistic, with around 38% of traders expecting XRP to rally to a range of $2.00 to $2.50 by December 31. However, that figure has since dropped to 28%, reflecting a significant decline in confidence. Related Reading: Bitcoin Correction Timeline: Analyst Predicts Potential Bottom In October 2026 The possibility of the cryptocurrency exceeding $2.50 appears almost non-existent, as only about 4% of respondents foresee it reaching the $2.50 to $3.00 range, and a similar 4% predict it could surpass $3.00. The consensus of 73% predicting an XRP finish between $1.50 and $2.00 marks an increase from the 63% recorded earlier in the poll. This growing alignment among poll participants indicates that they are consolidating around this range as the most likely scenario. Furthermore, the sentiment towards higher price levels has significantly shifted. The percentage of voters anticipating a rally into the mid-$2 range has dwindled to a mere 4%, reflecting dwindling confidence after several failed attempts to break through resistance levels. Even the outlook for the altcoin’s price to drop below $1.50 has risen slightly to 7%, up from 6%, although most believe a sharp sell-off is unlikely. Rising Supply From Early Investors This prevailing sentiment aligns with Futures data indicating a prevalence of aggressive sell orders, while the slow accumulation of XRP in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) at a pace of $30 to $50 million daily cannot keep up with profit-taking and risk reduction activities in the market. On-chain data reveals that significant realized gains have been secured as XRP approached its recent highs. For instance, a long-term holder who initially acquired the altcoin around $0.40 sold over 350 million tokens at approximately $2.00, reaping an estimated profit of $721 million. Related Reading: Ethereum Fails To Surpass $3,000: Predictions For The Final Days Of The Year With many early investors reportedly cashing out at the $2 level, there has been minimal support for dip-buying to bolster the price, keeping it in the current range between $1.7 and $1.8 recorded in the week. Experts suggest that when the supply increases from long-term holders, whose initial investments were made at $0.40 to $0.60, it creates a resistance ceiling that is challenging to break without substantial new demand entering the market. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $1.830. The altcoin has recorded major losses in all time frames, with a year-to-date decline of 15%, in line with the broader market’s performance.

Speaking on CNBC, the newly confirmed NASA Administrator said the United States will head back to the moon under President Donald Trump’s second term. And this time, it’s for what Jared calls the “orbital economy.” “We want to have that opportunity to explore and realize the scientific, economic and national security potential on the moon,” Jared said during the interview. He pointed directly to Trump’s renewed interest in space, calling it the key to turning the moon into an off-Earth economic hub. The US Senate had finally confirmed Jared’s appointment last week after a chaotic back-and-forth that dragged all through 2025. Trump’s NASA pick returns with space business agenda Trump first picked Jared to run NASA back in December 2024. Then, in May, he suddenly yanked the nomination. No reason was given, but insiders allegedly pointed fingers at Jared’s tight relationship with Elon, since Trump and the latter publicly broke up last summer. But the beef didn’t last. Trump circled back in November and renominated Jared, who already had the astronaut badge after flying on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon in 2021. Now he’s not just aiming for the moon.Jared laid out plans for space data centers, nuclear power, and Helium-3 mining. The rare gas could be a future fuel for fusion reactors and is buried in the moon’s surface. He also wants a permanent base, with nuclear propulsion systems ready to go beyond the moon. That’s not a fantasy. Jared made it clear that these ideas are already in motion. NASA is working with SpaceX, Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, and Boeing under the Artemis campaign, which focuses on building a long-term presence on the moon and preparing for missions to Mars. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act gave this campaign a huge boost by dropping $9.9 billion into NASA’s pocket earlier this year. Artemis II, the first crewed test flight on NASA’s Space Launch System and Orion spacecraft, is scheduled soon. That mission will be followed by Artemis III, with SpaceX providing the lunar landing vehicle. Jared also said both SpaceX and Blue Origin are making reusable heavy-lift rockets using on-orbit cryogenic propellant transfer. He said , “That’s what’s going to enable us to be able to go to and from the moon affordably, with great frequency, and set up for missions to Mars and beyond.” Tesla’s Cybertruck problem gets a SpaceX-sized bailout Back on Earth, Tesla’s numbers are looking ugly. The company is struggling to sell even 20,000 Cybertrucks a year. That’s a far cry from Elon’s original promise of 500,000 units. Warehouses are now overflowing with unsold trucks. Production has already been scaled back. But here comes SpaceX. The company bought over 1,000 Cybertrucks, and they might double that soon. An X user posted a video showing a storage lot filled with the vehicles. With each truck priced around $80,000, SpaceX’s order could total between $80 million and $160 million in Tesla sales. Clearly, SpaceX is now turning into the main source of Elon’s wealth, not Tesla, like we’re used to. If things keep going this way, it will almost certainly even push his net worth over $1 trillion by this time next year. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The letter , shared publicly, offers a short, personal account of intake procedures, the move into housing, and his first days behind bars. He wrote that the place was “confusing and unnatural”, yet “manageable”, and that fellow inmates had treated him with respect. Inside The Prison Letter Rodriguez wrote that he had gone through searches and medical checks during intake, and that he was settling in after what he called an emotional goodbye to family days before the holiday. The note was dated Christmas Eve and marked his seventh day at the facility. Reports said his wife was scheduled as his first visitor on Christmas Day. Those details make the timing — and the human side of the story — hard to miss. Rodriguez was sentenced on Nov. 19 on charges tied to his role in a crypto mixing protocol. His case has become a touchpoint for a wider dispute about whether building or maintaining privacy software can carry criminal liability when others misuse those tools. The debate has drawn comparisons to the prosecution of Roman Storm, a co-founder of Tornado Cash, and raised questions about how the law treats open-source code and the people who write it. Samourai: Legal Debate Over Code And Crime Supporters say Rodriguez’s prosecution threatens free speech and software development. A petition asking for clemency gathered more than 12,000 signatures, and many privacy advocates argue that no direct victims were harmed by his work. In public posts, Rodriguez framed his case as “lawfare” and criticized regulators and judges for targeting innovation. Those claims have been repeated widely in crypto circles. Prosecutors argue differently. They point to the structure and promotion of certain tools and say some actors used them to hide illicit transfers. Courts have faced the hard question of where to draw the line between code as neutral technology and code used to facilitate crime. That tension is central to why Rodriguez’s sentence has drawn such attention from developers, legal scholars, and privacy groups. Samourai Drama: Calls For Clemency Gain Traction US President Donald Trump said on Dec. 16 that he would “take a look” at Rodriguez’s case after it gained public attention. That brief remark kept the possibility of executive clemency in public view, though such reviews do not always lead to action. Rodriguez publicly appealed to the president for a pardon as he began serving his sentence. Public reaction has been mixed. Some see the petition and media coverage as a push to protect open-source developers. Others stress that courts will weigh evidence about intent and conduct, not just the code itself. What remains clear is that this case has pulled the issue into the open and made it harder for lawmakers and courts to ignore.

The arrest, confirmed by both Coinbase and Indian police in Hyderabad, came months after hackers bribed customer service staff to steal customer information. This triggered a $20 million ransom demand and left the company facing a $400 million fallout. The breach began in May, when hackers managed to buy access from Coinbase contractors outside the U.S. and gain entry to internal systems. They didn’t hack through firewalls or code, they just found staff and offered cash. “What these attackers were doing was finding Coinbase employees and contractors based in India who were associated with our business process outsourcing or support operations, that kind of thing, and bribing them in order to obtain customer data,” said Philip Martin, Coinbase’s Chief Security Officer. Coinbase says access was shut down quickly The breach was so wide that it allowed attackers near-instant access to customer accounts for months. This type of social engineering attack has become a growing problem in the crypto world. It’s simple: pay someone on the inside. Philip denied that the hackers had full access the entire time. He said in an interview with Bloomberg News that once the company discovered staff were leaking data, their access was immediately revoked. “They did not have persistent access over the course of the entire period,” he claimed. The arrest was announced on X by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who wrote: “We have zero tolerance for bad behavior and will continue to work with law enforcement to bring bad actors to justice. Thanks to the Hyderabad Police in India, an ex-Coinbase customer service agent was just arrested. Another one down and more still to come.” Not everyone clapped. One user replied under Brian’s post: “lol why you acting like this is a win. You hired them in the first place.” Coinbase faces rising costs and deeper scrutiny Coinbase is still digging out of the mess.The cost of repairing damage and reimbursing affected users could be as high as $400 million, putting it among the top ten biggest crypto hacks ever, according to Elliptic. In February, Bybit suffered a similar attack that cost them $1.5 billion, and in total, $2.2 billion was lost to crypto hacks in 2024, per Chainalysis data. A Coinbase spokesperson confirmed the India arrest and said it followed the firm’s work with the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office, where charges were recently filed against a Brooklyn man accused of running “a long-running impersonation scheme targeting Coinbase customers.” Meanwhile, Coinbase shares slipped 1.2% to $236.79 on Friday, and are now down about 4.6% in 2025. Despite the chaos, Coinbase still holds most of the $122 billion in spot-Bitcoin ETF tokens, and remains a major political player. It’s become the largest crypto donor in U.S. politics, pouring over $52 million into campaigns during the 2024 cycle. The crypto industry overall made up half of the nearly $250 million in corporate political donations, with Coinbase leading the pack, according to watchdog group Public Citizen and data from OpenSecrets.

Roughly $1 trillion left active equity mutual funds as frustration built around weak stock selection and a market that refused to reward diversity. The S&P 500 kept hitting records, but the gains came from the same tight group of seven American tech giants. Owning anything else meant falling behind, and investors noticed. Fund managers who aimed for balance faced a brutal setup. A portfolio packed with many sectors looked sensible on paper, but the market only cared about megacap tech. That gap tested patience, specifically due to how wide it became between those winners and everything else, year after year. Money exits active strategies as market concentration tightens As the year moved on, cash flowed out steadily.Estimates from Bloomberg Intelligence using ICI data show about $1 trillion pulled from active equity mutual funds. That marked the 11th straight year of net outflows and the deepest of the cycle. Passive equity exchange-traded funds moved the other way and took in more than $600 billion. Investors didn’t rush for the exits all at once. They watched performance. Many paid fees for portfolios that looked different from the index. When those differences failed to pay off, patience ran out. Dave Mazza, chief executive officer of Roundhill Investments, said the setup worked against active managers. “The concentration makes it harder for active managers to do well,” Mazza said. “If you do not benchmark weight the Magnificent Seven, then you’re likely taking risk of underperformance.” Some market watchers expected stock picking to shine.Instead, the cost of straying from the benchmark stayed high all year.Market breadth stayed weak. On many days in the first half, fewer than 20% of stocks rallied with the market, based on BNY Investments data. That kind of narrow action can happen, but its length mattered. When gains keep coming from a tiny group, spreading bets hurts results. The same pattern showed up in the indexes. The S&P 500 beat its equal-weighted version all year. For investors, the choice was; go underweight large stocks and lag, or hug the index and explain why an active equity fee made sense. Few active funds beat benchmarks despite isolated standouts In the U.S., 73% of equity mutual funds lagged their benchmarks in 2025, according to Athanasios Psarofagis of Bloomberg Intelligence. That ranked as the fourth-worst showing since 2007. Results got worse after April’s tariff scare faded and excitement around artificial intelligence locked in tech leadership. There were exceptions, but they carried different risks.One came from Dimensional Fund Advisors.Its $14 billion International Small Cap Value Portfolio returned just over 50%, beating its benchmark, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq 100. The fund held about 1,800 stocks, mostly outside the U.S., with large exposure to financials, industrials, and materials. It avoided the U.S. large-cap index almost entirely. Joel Schneider, deputy head of portfolio management for North America, summed it up. “This year provides a really good lesson,” Schneider said. “Everyone knows that global diversification makes sense, but it’s really hard to stay disciplined and actually maintain that.” Another case came from Margie Patel at the Allspring Diversified Capital Builder Fund. The fund returned about 20%, helped by bets on Micron Technology and Advanced Micro Devices. Patel pushed back on closet indexing. “A lot of people like to be closet or quasi indexers,” she said on Bloomberg TV. “The winners are going to stay winners.” Big stocks getting bigger fueled bubble talk. The Nasdaq 100 traded above 30 times earnings and near six times sales. Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, who launched an AI-focused ETF in 2025 that grew to almost $1 billion, said volatility was part of the trade. “There are going to be white-knuckle moments,” Ives said. “We believe this tech bull market goes for another two years.” VanEck’s Global Resources Fund rose almost 40%, driven by demand tied to energy, farming, and metals, as the fund owns Shell, Exxon Mobil, and Barrick Mining, and mixes geologists with analysts. Shawn Reynolds, who has run it for 15 years, said active management allows big thematic bets.

Additionally, it was confirmed that while individuals had expressed excitement earlier, concerns about Zcash’s main token have decreased, and investors have demonstrated increased interest in its privacy features. This growing interest illustrated the fact that several users highly prefer private transactions. The crypto community expresses heightened interest in privacy features Regarding the current situation with Zcash privacy adoption , sources have attempted to explain that the stability surrounding the firm’s interest in privacy features was observed after a lengthy period of rapid growth encountered earlier this year. At this time, privacy solutions were the most preferred option within the crypto ecosystem. Moreover, recently released reports have highlighted that current data indicate that users who utilize these privacy tools continue to do so. Interestingly, a reliable source highlighted that the shift in focus towards privacy has not only increased for Zcash but also been identified in other initiatives. This was after a report earlier noted that other projects have also drawn the attention of several individuals and have increased in value. An example of these projects is Monero . Notably, Monero is a popular cryptocurrency project focused heavily on user privacy and anonymity. It has faced considerable gains, indicating that people have increasingly begun to embrace privacy solutions as they have become widely available across multiple platforms, rather than being restricted to just one platform. Meanwhile, as privacy solutions spread rapidly among users, sources have revealed that development efforts are starting to spread across various ecosystems and blockchains. These efforts are adopted as groups establish privacy-enhancing features purposefully to operate in their unique platforms. This increase witnessed in the crypto industry triggered analysts to predict that there is a high likelihood that the significance of privacy will continue to be embraced in 2026. Based on their anticipation, they clarified that the rise will be influenced by real-world needs rather than speculation, leading to the conclusion that the demand for privacy becomes evident as stablecoin payments and day-to-day on-chain transactions surge. On the other hand, analysts warned that the transparency of public blockchains can make regular payments complex due to the use of an on-chain wallet, which typically discloses one’s entire transaction history to others and their balances. Such a scenario is viewed as a significant privacy issue for both personal and business transactions. Grayscale undertakes an important step in the crypto ecosystem The heated discussions between the openness of blockchain technology and the demand for user privacy have prompted several individuals in the ecosystem to agree with the earlier argument, implying that privacy solutions will continue to be valued as crucial in this time when cryptocurrencies are moving towards practical payment uses. However, speculative interests change to other topics. In the meantime, reports last month noted the entry of a privacy coin to Wall Street. This statement highlights that the crypto ecosystem underwent a period when a technology designed to promote privacy was forced to operate within the highly regulated system of international finance. This situation was identified as Grayscale’s attempt to list a Zcash ETF on NYSE Arca with ticker ZCSH. With this move, sources acknowledged that Grayscale has taken a significant step in the industry to integrate a privacy coin into its comprehensive, transparent ecosystem of ETF filings, approved custodians, sanctions checks, and brokerage regulations. Ideally, the entire project serves as a test for a straightforward question: “Is it possible for privacy to be maintained under regulation, or does regulation fully overshadow privacy?” Don’t just read crypto news.

He believes such views are based on incomplete assumptions and overlook how value moves through global financial networks. As of this writing, XRP trades around $1.84, far below the level Jesse sees as achievable if adoption expands. Assessment of Transaction Scale Versus Cryptocurrency Valuation Jesse’s stance is rooted in payment throughput rather than speculation. He notes that Bitcoin commands a multi-trillion-dollar market presence but still handles relatively small settlement volume when compared with traditional finance. In contrast, central banks move far greater capital daily, often surpassing what Bitcoin processes across an entire year. From this comparison, Jesse argues that using Bitcoin’s valuation framework to judge XRP’s potential sets inaccurate limits, since both assets operate within distinct use cases and throughput expectations. People saying XRP can't go past $10 really haven't done their research. One Ripple partner (Bank of England) does more volume in one day than Bitcoin in a YEAR and it will use XRP to settle transactions. Wake up people! pic.twitter.com/BAi34TJ9VR — Apex Crypto Insights (NFA) (@APEXCONSULTNFA) December 17, 2025 Institutional Settlement as Ripple’s Strategic Advantage A central point in Jesse’s argument is Ripple’s positioning within financial infrastructure. While Bitcoin is generally treated as a store of value, Ripple has spent years building technology for cross-border payments and banking-grade settlement. Jesse believes this strategic focus gives XRP a different growth path from most digital assets. He highlights Ripple’s existing engagement with financial institutions and future opportunities for integration with banks and potentially central banks. If XRP becomes a settlement asset within systems that process significant liquidity, Jesse asserts that transactional volume could scale beyond what market-cap projections typically model. The Central Bank Dimension and the $10 Projection Jesse also calls attention to how many monetary authorities exist globally. With more than 170 central banks worldwide, he argues that focusing only on one example understates potential infrastructure demand. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In his view, claims that XRP cannot exceed $10 rely heavily on static market-cap calculations, without accounting for liquidity cycles, high-frequency settlement, or institutional utility. He rejects the idea that XRP’s valuation ceiling must remain low based on past performance, asserting that pricing models must also consider payment velocity in large transactions. Jesse maintains that XRP’s purpose is transactional rather than speculative, and price movements may lag behind real-world usage. He suggests that investors who base expectations solely on historical price action may overlook longer-term utility-driven appreciation. Reaching $10 from current prices would require roughly a five-fold increase and place XRP’s market capitalization near $600 billion, surpassing Ethereum’s previous valuation range. Although Jesse supports the likelihood of double-digit pricing under significant adoption, the view is not universal. Some observers believe such projections are optimistic, given that XRP has not sustained prices above $3.84 in nearly a decade. Others note that growing institutional accumulation and ETF activity could influence valuation trends over time.

The breach has impacted hundreds of users, with on-chain data showing that more than $6.77 million has already been stolen. The timing has amplified concern, coming at a moment when investors are already navigating heightened uncertainty, declining prices, and rising risk aversion. Related Reading: XRP Exchange Reserves On Binance Fall To Six-Month Low: Selling Pressure Is Easing According to the Trust Wallet team, the exploit appears to be linked to a recent update to its Chrome browser extension. In a public statement posted on X, the company urged users to take immediate action, stating: “Users with Browser Extension 2.68 should disable and upgrade to 2.69.” The message suggests that the vulnerability was isolated to a specific version of the extension, rather than the core wallet infrastructure, but the scale of the losses has nonetheless raised alarm. Trust Wallet is one of the most widely used self-custody wallets in the industry. Reporting a user base of roughly 220 million people globally. That reach makes any security incident particularly significant, not only because of the direct financial impact, but also due to the broader implications for trust in non-custodial platforms. As investigations continue and affected users assess the damage, the exploit adds another layer of stress to a market already grappling with weak sentiment and elevated skepticism toward crypto infrastructure. Funds Tracked As Trust Wallet Commits To Full Reimbursement On-chain investigators have begun tracing the movement of funds linked to the Trust Wallet exploit. According to analysis shared by Lookonchain, the attacker has already transferred approximately $5.5 million through a combination of instant swap services and centralized exchanges, including ChangeNOW, FixedFloat, KuCoin, and HTX. Routing funds through multiple channels suggests an attempt to obscure flows and accelerate laundering. A pattern commonly observed in recent wallet exploits. Despite the ongoing movement of stolen assets, Trust Wallet has moved quickly to reassure users. Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) publicly stated that Trust Wallet will fully cover all user losses resulting from the incident. This commitment has been central to calming concerns. Particularly given the wallet’s large global user base and the broader climate of weakened trust in crypto infrastructure. The Trust Wallet team later reinforced this position with a formal statement, confirming the scale of the impact and outlining next steps. “We’ve confirmed that approximately $7M has been impacted and we will ensure all affected users are refunded,” the team said. The team added that supporting affected users is the top priority, and they are actively finalizing the refund process. The statement also warned users to avoid interacting with messages that do not originate from official Trust Wallet channels. As fund tracking continues, the focus has now shifted from damage assessment to execution of reimbursements and restoration of user confidence. Altcoin Market Holds Key Support As Broader Structure Weakens The total cryptocurrency market capitalization excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum is trading near the $825 billion level on the weekly chart. Following a sharp pullback from the $1.1–$1.2 trillion highs reached earlier this year. This index, used as a proxy for broader altcoin market health, shows a clear loss of momentum after an aggressive expansion phase. Signaling rising stress across the altcoin sector. Technically, the market has slipped below its faster weekly moving average, which previously acted as dynamic support during the uptrend. That level has now flipped into resistance, limiting upside attempts. Price is currently hovering just above the longer-term moving averages, which converge between roughly $780 billion and $820 billion. This zone represents a critical structural support area. A sustained break below it would likely confirm a broader bearish transition for altcoins. Related Reading: Bitcoin and Ethereum Coinbase Inflows Collapse While Binance Retains Relative Activity – Details From a market-structure perspective, holding the current range keeps the possibility of consolidation alive. However, failure to defend this support would open the door to a deeper retracement toward the $650–$700 billion region. For a bullish case to re-emerge, the altcoin market would need to reclaim the $900 billion level and reestablish acceptance above its key moving averages.

This surge in the RWA sector can largely be attributed to the performance of specific platforms. Notably, Keeta Network has skyrocketed by 1,794.9% YTD, while Zebec Network and Maple Finance have recorded gains of 217.3% and 123.0% respectively. Related Reading: Bitcoin Correction Timeline: Analyst Predicts Potential Bottom In October 2026 Current statistics show that the crypto RWA sector boasts a Distributed Asset Value of $18.88 billion, reflecting a 2.56% increase over the past month. However, the Represented Asset Value has seen a slight decline, standing at $407.93 billion, down 2.36%. For context, RWA’s approach facilitates asset managers and projects the digital transformation of tangible assets, such as real estate and commodities, creating a solid foundation for trading, managing, and securing these assets. Layer-1 (L1) solutions have emerged as the second most profitable narrative this year, achieving an average price gain of 80.3% YTD. The success of this narrative can be attributed to the performance of privacy-focused blockchains such as Zcash and Monero, which have seen rallies of 691.3% and 143.6%, respectively. Another noteworthy crypto narrative, “Made in USA,” is also on track to end the year positively, with average gains of 30.6% YTD, primarily driven by Zcash’s performance that mitigated the moderate losses of other tokens in that category. Top Meme Tokens Suffer Heavy Losses Despite their popularity, narratives such as memecoins and artificial intelligence (AI) have struggled this year, with average returns of -31.6% and -50.2% year-to-date, respectively. Leading memecoins in the crypto space, such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), have demonstrated the volatility of this sector by suffering significant losses of over 60% year-to-date. Similarly, the report notes that many artificial intelligence-focused crypto assets have recorded declines between 49.8% and 84.3%, with only Alchemist AI and Kite performing relatively better.

The decentralized exchange (DEX) narrative has mirrored this decline with average losses of -55.5%, while layer-2 (L2) solutions have also struggled, recording average returns of -40.6% for the second year in a row. At the time of writing, the market’s leading crypto, Bitcoin (BTC), was trading at $88,960, having recorded losses of 10% year-to-date.

56429055,648973,1766804405,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56429055.jpeg,The State Of US Stablecoin Legislation: Unresolved Issues And Challenges,https://bitcoinist.com/us-stablecoin-legislation-issues-and-challenges/,"In a recent report, market expert Colin Wu shed light on the ongoing issues facing the cryptocurrency industry as a result of stablecoin legislation, notably the GENIUS Act, which was enacted in July under President Donald Trump’s administration. While this bill is viewed as a significant win for the digital asset market—anticipating increased adoption and utilization in the foreseeable future—it brings with it a host of complications that warrant attention. Wu Highlights Potential Risks In The GENIUS Act Wu’s analysis emphasizes that the GENIUS Act has led to heightened global demand for US dollars and Treasury securities, which, while bolstering the dollar’s international standing, has also inadvertently benefited the Trump family and associates linked to the crypto industry. However, this development has opened new challenges for the oversight of dollar flows globally and raises concerns about the stability of the traditional financial system in the United States. A notable concern is how the trading of crypto assets enabled by USD stablecoins has evolved into a complex and less observable method for the US to extract wealth worldwide. Wu asserts that this mechanism poses significant threats to the monetary sovereignty and financial security of other nations. The GENIUS Act outlines reserve asset categories like bank deposits, short-term Treasuries, and repo agreements. However, the fluctuating values of these assets can lead to potential insufficiencies in reserves, particularly if Treasury prices decline. How Stablecoin Laws May Undermine The Industry’s Foundations Wu also explained that addressing the challenges of fiat stablecoins, lawmakers are likely to instigate regulations affecting all crypto assets, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Real-World Assets (RWAs), since these assets rely heavily on stablecoins. Currently, licensed financial institutions cannot directly engage in trading, clearing, or custody of crypto assets due to the lack of legal recognition, leaving these opportunities to unregulated private firms. This scenario has reportedly led to higher profits for unregulated actors while increasing pressure on banks and the broader financial ecosystem. Consequently, this dynamic has prompted government authorities to hasten stablecoin regulation. Once crypto assets receive full legal recognition, banks are expected to step into the market completely. This shift would enable banks and payment institutions to tokenize deposits, allowing them to directly link deposit tokens with traditional financial elements. The overall trend in the US indicates a move toward a system where heavily regulated banks establish stability. This shift would reportedly facilitate the principle of “same business, same regulation,” leading to diminished risks for the monetary and financial structure. However, this transformation through stablecoin legislation may threaten the very foundation of the stablecoin industry itself. Wu concludes that in this context, it would be illogical for other nations to replicate the aggressive push for stablecoin development that the US has adopted.

In a recent post, he noted that Japan and South Korea are reportedly discussing potential collaboration on blockchain-related initiatives. Although details have not yet been officially disclosed, Kanzaki stated that progress in these discussions may have implications for XRP adoption across the region. Early Signals of Japan–South Korea Blockchain Coordination Kanzaki referenced growing cooperation between both countries in the digital asset sector. Japan and South Korea represent two of the largest technology and finance hubs in Asia, and conversations about shared blockchain frameworks suggest interest beyond experimentation. If formal structures are introduced, they could support payment systems, remittance infrastructure, and enterprise blockchain deployment, areas where Ripple technology is already active. 日本と韓国はブロックチェーンインフラの共同開発に着手しています。 これらの協議は現在非公開で行われていますが、その影響は非常に大きいものとなるでしょう。 XRP保有者は、今後の動向に細心の注意を払うべきです。これはリップルにとって大きな転機となるでしょう。 — Yuto (@yutokanzakireal) December 25, 2025 Regulatory Updates Could Strengthen Ripple’s Position in Japan A separate update highlighted by Kanzaki on December 2 indicated that Japan is preparing to introduce regulations that would allow Ripple Prime and Ripple Custody to operate within the country’s established digital asset compliance system. Clear guidance of this nature would make it easier for regulated financial institutions to integrate Ripple-based services, improving conditions for future institutional participation. These policy signals follow Ripple’s earlier strategic investment in both markets. In mid-2024, Ripple allocated a significant portion of its long-term one-billion-XRP program to the XRPL Japan and Korea Fund . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Funding was directed toward expanding major partnerships, supporting new projects on the XRP Ledger, providing investment to startups, and sponsoring developer and education initiatives. Ripple stated that the commitment could reach tens of millions of dollars, reflecting its interest in deepening regional adoption. Expanding Validator Activity in East Asia Growth is also visible at the network level. In South Korea, Infinite Block became an official validator, enabling corporate-grade XRP services under regulatory oversight. Meanwhile, Japan-based SBI VC Trade joined the validator ecosystem as well, reinforcing its position as one of Ripple’s strongest partners in Asia . Wider validator participation enhances resilience and institutional readiness across the XRP Ledger, which is important for markets that operate under strict compliance rules. Kanzaki believes the combination of government-level talks, upcoming regulatory clarification, Ripple’s regional investment program, and the increase in XRPL validator activity points to a meaningful shift in market readiness within Asia. For this reason, he suggests that XRP holders monitor developments closely, particularly as Japan and South Korea evaluate cooperative blockchain pathways. If progress continues, he argues that Ripple could secure a stronger role in future financial infrastructure discussions across the region.

Michael rejected claims that the current AI boom is driven by money looping between the same companies rather than real demand. Michael said the focus on a circular model ignores what he described as a global supply imbalance tied to hardware, energy, and infrastructure. “Circular is the incorrect way of looking at it,” Michael said during the conversation. “It’s a lot of companies working to address an imbalance that is distorting the globe.” CoreWeave believes physical limits is what is slowing AI hardware delivery “The primary constraint is a physical bottleneck associated with getting the most performant compute into the hands of the most cutting edge players,” Michael said. Michael added that this pressure reaches far beyond cloud firms and chip suppliers. Michael shared details from a recent conversation with a mining company executive, who he did not name, where the discussion focused on materials needed to build infrastructure. He said the mining executive explained that the strain goes two levels deeper into the supply chain, reaching raw metals and copper used to support AI systems. Michael said the mining executive made a direct request for cooperation across industries to increase output. “We need to work together as a group,” the executive told him. Michael said similar comments from leaders inside AI companies are often criticized as proof of a circular economy. “If I say that in the AI space, I get accused of being in a circular economy,” he said. “So that’s all I’ll say on the circular economy is, like, you do that by working together.” Concerns from critics have also focused on risk tied to debt and customer exposure. Some warn that if CoreWeave fails to refinance obligations or loses a major client, lenders could release large volumes of used GPUs into secondary markets, hurting prices and causing disruption. Michael addressed that scenario by pointing to demand trends instead. He said the growth he sees is fast and aggressive, not fragile. CoreWeave faces stock swings as demand from big tech stays intense Michael said CoreWeave sits at the center of rising demand because of its focus on parallel computing, which supports modern AI workloads. He said requests from large technology firms continue without pause. Since its IPO, CoreWeave’s stock has been wobbly, but Michael only pointed out that shares now trade near $90, compared with an IPO price of $40. Michael also addressed past reliance on Microsoft, which once accounted for 85% of company revenue, saying that exposure has dropped after active diversification. He claims that no single customer now makes up more than 30% of the backlog, urging investors to ignore short delays that draw heavy reactions, such as a data center opening pushed back by a week, which he said triggered “bedlam” from short term observers. Michael described the current phase as a macro super cycle driven by a move from sequential to parallel computing that opens access to far greater compute capacity. Michael said the challenges slowing delivery remain tied to policy limits, physical infrastructure, and energy access. “The reasons that you have challenges in delivering that compute is because of policy, because of physical infrastructure, because of energy,” he said. “You do that by working together.” Don’t just read crypto news.

Both TeraWulf and Cipher have landed multi-billion dollar contracts with Alphabet's Google Cloud and Amazon's AWS, driving projected revenue growth of 132% and 66% in 2026, respectively. Valuation multiples for both companies could expand to 21-22x 2026 revenues, implying 45-50% share price upside from current levels. Risks include TeraWulf’s higher leverage and the critical need for both companies to deliver on large-scale infrastructure commitments by 2026. Investment Thesis Next year is going to be a make-or-break year for crypto miners. The stagnation in Bitcoin’s price so far has cornered crypto miners into a difficult position of winding down operations of their GPU infrastructure while demonstrating a return on these compute assets at the same time. With the colossal proliferation of AI and HPC workloads, crypto miners have figured out that pivoting to AI will give them a 2x benefit—keeping the lights on in their GPU data centers while also raising their margin profiles. Even better, many crypto miners in 2025 scored massive deals with the big spenders, hyperscalers, and frontier LLM labs. All eyes turn to how crypto miners eventually deliver on these big deals in 2026—the year of AI reckoning for these crypto miners. TeraWulf ( WULF ) and Cipher Mining ( CIFR ) are two such crypto miners who also jumped on the crypto-to-AI pivot bandwagon in 2025. I had previously recommended a Buy rating on both these companies, and I continue to recommend a Buy rating on both of them. TeraWulf and Cipher Mining’s Unique Pivot To AI In the past couple of months, I initiated Buy ratings on TeraWulf and Cipher Mining, citing impressive dynamics engineered in their respective HPC deals. Unfortunately, markets soured on prospects of AI tailwinds since then, with many investors questioning the tenacity of these tailwinds. My view stands firm—that AI is a strong secular force that will positively impact those that invest with AI in mind, and the recent pullbacks in the market give valuations a much-needed respite from the excitement in AI. 2025 has definitely shown the appreciation markets have towards the changing nature of crypto miners’ pivot towards supporting global AI workloads. The operations of all crypto miners typically centered on working towards securing three main resources—GPU, data center infrastructure, and power to support their crypto mining operations. But the severe downturn in crypto this year, as seen in the price of Bitcoin, the mothership of all cryptocurrencies, has complicated the business model of crypto miners. This can be seen in the declining hash rate index, a closely watched yardstick for the crypto mining industry’s revenues. Exhibit A: Hash price index drops to record lows this year. (Hashrate Index) A declining hash rate index should have been alarming for the crypto mining industry because it indicates stress in the business environment for crypto miners along with risks to profitability. But in 2025, we also saw a strong divergence where stocks of crypto miner companies decoupled from Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), as seen below. Exhibit B: Crypto miner stocks represented by CoinShares’ Bitcoin Mining ETF decouples from the sluggish price of Bitcoin. (Seeking Alpha) With the volume of AI and HPC workloads surging, demand for compute has also skyrocketed. So far, hyperscalers had attempted to keep up with their need for compute by raising their capex budgets well beyond 50-60% CAGR rates. Exhibit C: Hyperscaler capex so far has surged to meet intense demand for compute. (bloomberg) But the intense scrutiny on the free cash flows of hyperscalers seen in the past 2-3 months will have surely put a lid on the days of 50-60% capex CAGR that is expected to slow down to just 25% by the end of this year . Faced with this conundrum of slowing capex along with rising compute needs, hyperscalers are increasingly going to crypto miners, who are in prime position to quickly scale data center capacity because most of the crypto miners already have contracts in place with their respective power companies and infrastructure providers to bring data center compute online. Of all the crypto miners who have been racing to score deals where they offer up their compute and power resources to hyperscalers in exchange for annualized subscriptions, TeraWulf and Cipher Mining stand out in the crypto miner complex. Both TeraWulf and Cipher Mining have only one major client in common, Alphabet’s Google Cloud via Fluidstack, which is not just a customer of TeraWulf and Cipher’s data center infrastructure. Google is also an investor in both these companies, clearly announcing its vested interest in TeraWulf and Cipher Mining. In TeraWulf’s case, Alphabet will lease >200 MW of critical compute capacity via Fluidstack, which is expected to bring in ~$10B in revenues over the next decade. TeraWulf recently secured all the necessary financing to help them start building out the capacity for Google and Fluidstack, putting them on track for capacity delivery by H2 2026. One of the reasons TeraWulf may have been successful in favorably securing financing to support the build-out is because Google is backstopping their partnership with TeraWulf. The backstop implies Google Cloud is guaranteeing TeraWulf a total of ~$3.2B in lease obligations. The backstop, along with Google’s ~14% stake in TeraWulf (as part of the deal), has helped the crypto miner in securing project finance. Cipher Mining’s partnership between Google Cloud and Fluidstack is almost the same, except Cipher Mining is offering up a total of 207 MW of capacity by January 2027 to Google/Fluidstack. In exchange, Alphabet is also investing 5.4% in Cipher Mining while backstopping the partnership by ~$1.73B. Analysts were expecting the Cipher’s HPC revenue to come in at ~$127M in 2026, significantly rising to ~$740M in 2027. Exhibit D: Cipher Mining’s revenue mix shifting in 2026 to HPC. (S&P Intelligence) That was before Cipher Mining announced another hyperscaler win with Amazon's ( AMZN ) AWS to deliver ~300 MW of capacity. The total deal is worth ~$5.5B over 15 years. As it now stands, Wall Street is projecting a 66% jump in Cipher’s 2026 revenues, while TeraWulf’s revenues are expected to rise 132%. Valuation Levels For Cipher and TeraWulf If investors look at both TeraWulf and Cipher Mining, they will see that both these companies are trading at forward revenue multiples of ~13-14x. On the face of it, it appears that TeraWulf would look more attractive due to TeraWulf’s 132% projections in 2026 revenues. Exhibit E: Cipher Mining’s 2026 revenue multiple vs TeraWulf’s 2026 revenue multiples. (yCharts) However, I believe that Cipher’s revenue expectations are not accurately capturing the company’s ~300 MW agreement with Amazon’s AWS. I estimate the AWS deal can add at least $50M, if not more, to Cipher’s HPC revenues, pushing up the growth rates in Cipher’s 2026 revenues. Previously, I had explained why I believe Cipher’s shares warrant a forward revenue multiple of ~21-22x. That provides scope for Cipher’s revenue multiple to expand by ~45% from current 2026 revenue multiples of 14.5x, implying ~45% upside in Cipher’s shares. For TeraWulf, we can assume a similar expansion in its multiples if we compare TeraWulf vs Cipher Mining. That does provide scope for revenue multiple expansion in TeraWulf from 13.5 to ~21-22x, implying upside of ~50% in TeraWulf’s shares. Risks & Other Factors To Note However, in TeraWulf’s case, investors must note the risk of TeraWulf’s capital structure as compared to Cipher Mining. TeraWulf has ~$711M in cash vs. $1.1B in debt. Compared to TeraWulf, Cipher Mining boasts $1.2B in cash and $1B in debt. This means Cipher trades at an impressive multiple to its book value of just 8x, while TeraWulf richly trades at a book value multiple of 21x. At a broader level, 2026 will also be the year that will test the level of commitments of crypto miners. Many crypto miners have moved quickly to secure agreements with hyperscalers in the last few months and are quickly working to honor these commitments to bring only many megawatts of compute infrastructure. If these commitments are not honored, crypto miners risk losing millions of dollars' worth of revenues as well as losing the credibility of their business plan to pivot to AI. Takeaway 2026 will be a crucial year for crypto mining companies, which have used 2025 to pivot to AI and HPC workloads. TeraWulf and Cipher Mining stand out as two mining companies that are well positioned to benefit from the industry pivot towards AI. I am reiterating my Buy rating on both TeraWulf and Cipher Mining and updating my PT above.",BTC-USD|AMZN|GOOG|WULF|CIFR,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-27 03:43:54

XRP Has Possibly Been Trading Inside A Symmetrical Triangle In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a Triangle that XRP has been trading inside on the 15-minute timeframe. A “Triangle” is a TA pattern that appears whenever an asset consolidates between two converging trendlines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply Overhang: 6.6 Million BTC Bought Above Current Price The upper line of the pattern tends to be a source of resistance, while the lower one that of support. An escape beyond either boundary usually signals a breakout in that direction. Triangles can be of a few different types based on the orientation of their trendlines. Triangles that have one line parallel to the time-axis fall in either the Ascending or Descending categories. The pattern is an Ascending Triangle when the upper level is the parallel line, while it’s a Descending Triangle if the consolidation range shrinks to a downside. When both trendlines approach each other at a roughly equal and opposite slope, the pattern formed is known as a Symmetrical Triangle. This is the case that’s relevant in the current discussion. In a Symmetrical Triangle, the consolidation shrinks in an exactly sideways manner. As an asset moves through this pattern, its range gets narrower until it compresses down to a single point around the midline. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Symmetrical Triangle that the 15-minute price of XRP has been traveling inside recently: As displayed in the above graph, the 15-minute XRP price retested the lower level of the Symmetrical Triangle on Christmas and found support at it. This could be a potential sign that the channel is holding for now. As mentioned earlier, any level of a Triangle not holding up can signal a continuation of trend in that direction. This means that a surge above the channel can be a bullish sign, while a fall under it a bearish one. For Ascending and Descending Triangles, it’s usually considered that they have a direction bias attached to them, with Ascending Triangles being more likely to lead to bullish breakouts, while Descending Triangles to bearish breakdowns. Related Reading: Bitcoin Extreme Fear Streak Extends To 13 Days On Christmas In Symmetrical Triangles, though, the two lines are roughly identical, just mirrored, so breakouts could be equally probable in both directions. As such, it’s hard to say where XRP might escape from this Symmetrical Triangle. As for what might be the magnitude of the move a breakout could lead to, the analyst has noted it could potentially be of 10%. This is based on the fact that breakouts from consolidation channels are considered to end up being of the same length as the distance between the trendlines. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $1.84, down 3.3% over the last week.

56431019,648982,1766808016,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56431019.jpeg,Japan’s FY2026 Reform To Reshape Crypto Assets Taxation System – Report,https://bitcoinist.com/japans-2026-reform-reshape-crypto-taxation-system/,"Japan’s upcoming tax reform is expected to restructure the way crypto assets are treated in the country next year, changing digital assets classification and introducing a separate taxation system for different transactions. Japan Proposes New Taxation System On Friday, local news media outlets shared key details of Japan’s upcoming FY2026 Tax Reform Outline, published by the Liberal Democratic Party and the Japan Innovation Party on December 19. CoinPost reported that the 2026 tax reform will introduce significant changes to current taxation system related to the classification and regulation of crypto assets, which have been long requested by Japanese investors. Notably, the plan has proposed classifying digital assets as financial products, which indicates a shift from their previous treatment as speculative assets. As a result, the reform is exploring the introduction of a separate taxation system to crypto income, similar to stocks and investment trusts. According to the report, separate taxation and comprehensive taxation may not cover the same transactions. Under the existing system, crypto gains are taxed as “miscellaneous income,” with rates reaching up to 55%. The regular taxation system and miscellaneous income reporting may still apply depending on the transaction type. The reform outlines that crypto spot trading, derivative transactions, and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) would be subject for the separate taxation system. However, there’s no specific mention of reward-based transactions like staking or lending, suggesting that the applicable income category and taxation method for these transactions will require future addressing. Its worth noting that taxation for these transactions is split between the time of acquisition and the time of sale. When crypto assets are received as a reward for activities like staking, it is valued at market price at the time of acquisition and taxed as miscellaneous income. If the rewards are sold later, the resulting capital gain is subject to additional taxation. Meanwhile, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) will likely remain subject to the comprehensive taxation, as the reform doesn’t explicitly mention them, suggesting that NFTs trading and similar activities could continue to be treated as miscellaneous income and fall under the comprehensive taxation. Tax Reform To Separate ‘Specified Crypto Assets’ The local news outlet also highlighted that the separate taxation system may apply only to limited cryptocurrencies, as the reform stipulates the new taxation and reporting system for crypto trading business “businesses based on the premise of ‘trading in specified crypto assets.’” This could suggest that the “specified crypto assets” mentioned in the tax reform outline may not include all digital assets , but could be limited to those within a certain institutionally defined scope. “Based on the outline’s wording, it is an important point to note that not all cryptocurrency transactions will uniformly fall under the new system; rather, a system design delineating a specific scope is likely to be implemented,” the report detailed. Moreover, the 2026 tax reform outlined a proposal to allows losses from crypto transactions to be eligible for carryforward deductions for up to three years, similar to FX and stock policies in Japan. The introduction of carryforward deductions is expected to make tax adjustments easier, as investors previously had to offset unrealized losses against gains in profitable years to reduce taxable income. Lastly, the report noted the potential introduction of an exit tax in the future. Under the current system, crypto assets are not subject exit tax upon leaving Japan. However, the reclassification as financial instruments under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act could open the door to a system where unrealized gains become taxable upon departure",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto classification|crypto framework|Crypto Staking|Crypto tax laws|japan authorities|Japan crypto legislation|Japan Crypto Tax|Japan crypto tax reform|nfts,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-27 04:00:16

Bitcoin Difficulty Has Crossed 148 Trillion Hashes 2025 is coming to a close, and it was a year where Bitcoin miners significantly expanded their facilities. According to data from Blockchain.com , the network Hashrate , a measure of the total amount of computing power connected by the miners, has seen its 7-day average value go from 795.7 terahashes per second (TH/s) at the start of the year to 1070.3 TH/s today. During this phase of growth, the Hashrate set multiple new records, with the final all-time high (ATH) of 1,151.6 TH/s coming in October. Since then, the metric has slowed down, but even with the decline to the current level, it remains about 34.5% up since January 1st. Bitcoin miner revenue mostly comes from the block subsidy, which remains fixed in BTC value outside of Halving events, so miners tend to be dependent on growth in the price for a boost in their income. This is why the Hashrate usually follows the price trend. From the chart, it’s visible that the Hashrate’s ATH came right after the top in the cryptocurrency and the pullback in the metric since then has also come alongside a drawdown in the price. Miners have been more resilient than the asset, however, as BTC is down year-to-date, while the Hashrate is still up notably. Growth in the Bitcoin Hashrate always results in an increase in another metric, called the Difficulty . The Difficulty is a feature baked into the blockchain’s code, controlling how hard miners would find it to discover the next block on the network. It automatically changes its value about every two weeks, based on how miners performed since the last adjustment. Satoshi set a standard block time of 10 minutes for the network to follow; if miners take an average period faster than this to add blocks, the chain increases the Difficulty. The exact degree of the upward adjustment is always just enough to counteract the speed increase of the miners. In other words, it balances out the jump in the Hashrate. As miners were in a phase of growth this year, Bitcoin had to repeatedly elevate its Difficulty, setting new ATHs in the process. Since setting a new record above 155 trillion hashes in October, the Bitcoin Difficulty has also witnessed a decline. Even so, the metric at its current value of about 148.2 is still 35% up compared to the 109.8 trillion hashes level from the start of the year. The growth in the Difficulty has been pretty similar to that in the Hashrate, a natural consequence of the former reacting to the latter. BTC Price Bitcoin saw recovery above $89,000 earlier, but it seems the rally couldn’t last as the asset is already back at $87,300.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin difficulty|bitcoin mining|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MINING|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-27 05:00:09

According to The Information, both startups had connected to JPMorgan through Checkbook, a U.S.-based payments company. But the association with high-risk jurisdictions set off alarm bells inside the bank. JPMorgan insists it’s not cracking down on stablecoins . “This has nothing to do with stablecoin companies,” a bank spokesperson allegedly said. “We bank both stablecoin issuers and stablecoin-related businesses, and we recently took a stablecoin issuer public.” Still, the startups’ activity in Venezuela triggered concerns tied to U.S. financial rules, especially sanctions enforcement. Banks like JPMorgan are required to know who they’re dealing with and where their money is coming from, or else the SEC will come knocking. Trump isn’t known to have a forgiving nature. Trump seizes tankers and calls Venezuela oil a U.S. asset While JPMorgan was shutting off access, President Donald Trump was going full steam ahead with new actions against Venezuela. 2 weeks ago, Trump’s administration has intercepted two tankers full of Venezuelan oil, with a third one now being tracked. Speaking to reporters, the president said, “Maybe we will sell it, maybe we will keep it. Maybe we’ll use it in the strategic reserves. We’re keeping the ships also.” At the center of the crackdown is Venezuela’s state oil company, PDVSA, already blacklisted under Executive Orders 13850 and 13884 since 2019. Trump’s Treasury department claimed in their official notice that oil sales are keeping Nicolás Maduro’s regime afloat. Earlier this month, they officially labeled fentanyl (which they allege flows through Venezuela) a “weapon of mass destruction.” The U.S. Treasury Department on December 11 sanctioned six shipping companies that have been moving oil out of Venezuela using shady location tactics and fake data transmissions. The first company is Myra Marine Limited, based in the Marshall Islands. Next is Arctic Voyager Incorporated, also from the Marshall Islands. Then there’s Poweroy Investment Limited, registered in the British Virgin Islands. Ready Great Limited, also from the Marshall Islands, was also sanctioned along with Sino Marine Services Limited, a UK-registered company that runs the TAMIA (IMO: 9315642), which was flagged in Hong Kong. Lastly was Full Happy Limited, also registered in the Marshall Islands, and its ship took on oil in late May and sent it to Asia.

This dramatic shift highlights the intense volatility and inherent risks within the derivatives sector. Data reveals a stark imbalance, with long positions—bets on rising prices—accounting for a staggering 91.39% of the total Bitcoin liquidations. This pattern, mirrored in Ethereum but inverted for assets like Zcash, provides a crucial window into current trader sentiment and market mechanics. Understanding these liquidations is essential for any participant in the digital asset ecosystem. Bitcoin Liquidations Dominate Market Activity The cryptocurrency perpetual futures market experienced concentrated selling pressure over a 24-hour period. Bitcoin (BTC), the market leader, saw total liquidations reach $47.32 million . The overwhelming majority of this figure, precisely 91.39%, stemmed from long positions being liquidated. Consequently, this indicates a rapid price decline triggered cascading margin calls. Simultaneously, Ethereum (ETH) followed a similar trend with $21.18 million in liquidations, where longs constituted 74.9%. In stark contrast, Zcash (ZEC) presented an inverse scenario. Its $5.52 million in liquidations were overwhelmingly dominated by short positions at 94.88%, suggesting a sharp, unexpected price rally caught bearish traders off guard. These events did not occur in a vacuum. They are directly tied to the structure of perpetual futures contracts, which use leverage. Traders borrow capital to amplify their positions, but this also amplifies risk. A relatively small price move against a highly leveraged position can trigger automatic liquidation by the exchange. Therefore, the high percentage of long liquidations for BTC and ETH strongly suggests a coordinated downward price movement that systematically wiped out over-leveraged bullish bets across major platforms. Asset Total 24h Liquidations Long Position % Short Position % Bitcoin (BTC) $47.32M 91.39% 8.61% Ethereum (ETH) $21.18M 74.90% 25.10% Zcash (ZEC) $5.52M 5.12% 94.88% Mechanics of Crypto Futures Liquidations To fully grasp the significance of this data, one must understand the engine behind it: the perpetual futures market. Unlike traditional futures with expiry dates, perpetual contracts trade indefinitely, using a funding rate mechanism to tether their price to the underlying spot market. The critical element here is leverage . Exchanges allow traders to open positions worth many times their initial collateral. While this can magnify profits, it also drastically lowers the price move required to wipe out that collateral, a point known as the liquidation price . When the market price hits a trader’s liquidation price, the exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses. This process sells the asset into the market, often creating a feedback loop. A wave of long liquidations creates additional sell pressure, potentially pushing the price lower and triggering more liquidations. This phenomenon, sometimes called a long squeeze or cascading liquidation, is a hallmark of crypto market volatility. The 91% long liquidation rate for Bitcoin is a textbook indicator of such an event, where bullish overconfidence met with a sharp corrective move. Historical Context and Market Maturity Comparing this event to historical precedents, like the major deleveraging in May 2021 or the FTX-induced collapse in November 2022, reveals a market growing in scale but still grappling with similar structural risks. However, the absolute dollar value of liquidations, while significant, is lower relative to total market capitalization than in previous cycles. This suggests improved risk management tools among institutional participants and possibly lower aggregate leverage ratios. Nonetheless, the data proves that retail and speculative segments remain highly vulnerable. Analysts from firms like Glassnode and CoinMetrics consistently warn that high funding rates and crowded long positions are reliable, though not perfect, contrarian indicators for short-term market tops. Divergent Patterns: BTC/ETH vs. ZEC The radically different liquidation profile for Zcash offers a compelling counter-narrative. A market where 94.88% of liquidations are short positions indicates a violent short squeeze . In this scenario, traders betting on a price decline (shorts) are forced to buy back the asset to close their positions as the price rises, fueling further upward momentum. This can occur due to unexpected positive news, a large buy order, or low liquidity in the asset’s trading pairs. ZEC’s lower market capitalization and trading volume make it more susceptible to such volatile, asymmetric moves compared to the deeper, more liquid markets of Bitcoin and Ethereum. This divergence underscores a key lesson for traders: market context is everything . While macro factors might drive BTC and ETH, smaller altcoins like ZEC can move on idiosyncratic developments or simple market mechanics. A trader must analyze: Funding Rates: Persistently high rates often precede long liquidations. Open Interest: A sharp drop alongside price movement confirms liquidations. Volume & Liquidity: Thinner markets exacerbate liquidation volatility. The simultaneous occurrence of a long squeeze in major assets and a short squeeze in a minor one illustrates the complex, multi-faceted nature of cryptocurrency market dynamics in 2025. Impact and Implications for Traders The immediate impact of such liquidation events is a rapid repricing of risk across the entire derivatives landscape. Following the event, exchanges often see a temporary reduction in available leverage offers as risk engines recalibrate. For traders, the aftermath presents both caution and opportunity. The flushing out of excessive leverage can create a healthier foundation for the next price move, potentially resetting overextended indicators. However, it also serves as a stark reminder of the non-linear risks associated with leveraged trading. Risk management strategies become paramount. Experts advocate for: Using lower leverage multiples, especially in volatile conditions. Setting stop-loss orders at logical technical levels, not just based on margin requirements. Diversifying away from highly correlated perpetual futures positions. Continuously monitoring aggregate market data like the estimated leverage ratio and liquidation heatmaps. Ultimately, these events reinforce that cryptocurrency markets, while maturing, are fundamentally different from traditional finance. Their 24/7 nature, high leverage accessibility, and global participant base can lead to accelerated and amplified price discovery mechanisms, with liquidation cascades being a primary transmission channel. Conclusion The $47.32 million in Bitcoin liquidations, overwhelmingly skewed toward long positions, provides a critical case study in modern market structure. This event underscores the powerful and often punishing role of leverage in the cryptocurrency perpetual futures market. While the scale highlights growing institutional depth, the pattern confirms that speculative excess remains a potent force. The contrasting example of Zcash further demonstrates how market mechanics can produce violently opposite outcomes in different assets. For the astute observer, these Bitcoin liquidations are not merely a record of losses but a valuable dataset. They reveal prevailing sentiment, pinpoint systemic risks, and offer hard lessons on the essential discipline of risk management in the digital asset age. As markets evolve, understanding these dynamics will separate informed participants from the merely speculative. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when a long position is liquidated? A long position is liquidated when a trader who borrowed money to bet on a price increase sees the market fall to a level where their initial collateral is exhausted. The exchange automatically sells their position to repay the loan, locking in a total loss of the collateral. Q2: Why were Bitcoin long liquidations so high (91%) compared to shorts? This typically occurs during a rapid price decline. A high concentration of traders using leverage had placed bullish bets, and the downward move triggered a cascade of automatic sell orders from their liquidations, amplifying the drop. Q3: How is a short squeeze, like with Zcash, different? A short squeeze happens when the price rises sharply, forcing traders who borrowed and sold an asset (betting on a drop) to buy it back at a higher price to close their position. This buying pressure can fuel an even sharper rally, which is what the 94.88% short liquidation rate for ZEC indicates. Q4: Can liquidation events predict future price direction? Not directly, but they can indicate market extremes. A massive long liquidation event can sometimes signal that excessive bullish leverage has been “flushed out,” potentially creating a short-term bottom. However, it does not guarantee a reversal. Q5: How can traders protect themselves from liquidation? Key strategies include using much lower leverage (e.g., 3-5x instead of 20-50x), depositing more collateral than the minimum required (lowering your liquidation price), using stop-loss orders, and avoiding highly leveraged trades during periods of high volatility or extreme funding rates.

A tweet from crypto enthusiast X Finance Bull draws focus to what is described as a subtle yet meaningful change within the XRP ecosystem. Instead of highlighting short-term trading activity, the commentary centers on infrastructure building, validator participation, and liquidity commitments tied to Evernorth, an institutional digital asset treasury company positioning itself around XRP. The message emphasizes that institutional involvement rarely begins with public excitement. It often starts with foundational steps that indicate long-term intent. In this case, Evernorth is portrayed not as an entity seeking quick returns, but as one aligning its operations with the core mechanics that support sustained network activity. The $XRP Quiet Shift Few Are Watching Institutional adoption doesn’t start loud. It starts with infra, validators, and real liquidity commitments. Just like Evernorth is doing. They’re not just buying $XRP , they’re building with it: adding yield protocols, running nodes,… https://t.co/noOLD85Gy8 pic.twitter.com/OoGC34qZin — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) December 23, 2025 Building, Not Just Holding According to the post, Evernorth’s approach goes beyond acquiring XRP for balance sheet exposure. The company is presented as actively developing yield strategies, operating nodes, and strengthening order books. These actions suggest a commitment to being part of the operational fabric of the ecosystem rather than remaining a passive holder. X Finance Bull highlights a form of institutional participation focused on durability. Yield protocols, liquidity provisioning, and validator roles are typically associated with entities that expect to remain engaged over extended periods. The implication is that such involvement embeds XRP deeper into institutional workflows , reinforcing its role in treasury management and market infrastructure. By stressing that this is not a fund attempting to benefit from short-term market cycles, the commentary positions Evernorth as signaling intent rather than speculation. The idea advanced is that value is moving quietly, with positioning taking place before broader regulatory or market changes draw wider attention. David Schwartz on Evernorth’s Role The video attached to the post features remarks from Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, who describes Evernorth as a new institutional participant focused specifically on XRP. He explains that the company is backed by major industry names, including SBI, Ripple, Pantera, and Kraken, and that it is raising capital primarily to purchase XRP on the open market as part of a dedicated institutional treasury strategy. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Schwartz notes that Evernorth is actively managing its holdings through yield generation and capital market activities, while also planning to participate directly in the network as a validator. He adds that the firm intends to provision liquidity and integrate with decentralized finance protocols, including those connected to RLUSD , reinforcing the view that Evernorth aims to contribute operationally rather than only financially. He further states that the company is expected to explore solutions within the XRP Ledger ecosystem to generate yield, making it a participant seeking practical use cases rather than merely reallocating capital. The post concludes by classifying Evernorth’s activities as part of a broader migration of value happening away from public attention. It suggests that institutions positioning themselves now may be preparing for future shifts in market structure and regulatory clarity.

This comprehensive analysis examines the technological, regulatory, and market dynamics that will shape XRP’s future value. XRP Price Prediction: Foundation and Current Market Context Ripple’s XRP operates fundamentally differently from many cryptocurrencies. Consequently, its valuation depends on unique utility factors. The digital asset primarily facilitates cross-border payments and liquidity solutions for financial institutions through RippleNet. Currently, XRP maintains its position among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This standing reflects both its established infrastructure and ongoing legal developments that have created significant market uncertainty in recent years. Market analysts consistently reference several core metrics when evaluating XRP. These include transaction volume on the XRP Ledger, adoption rates by banking partners, and the resolution of the longstanding SEC litigation. Furthermore, broader cryptocurrency market cycles and macroeconomic conditions heavily influence its price action. Historical data shows XRP often moves with market trends while also experiencing volatility from case-specific news. Critical Factors Influencing the 2026-2030 Forecast Several interconnected elements will determine XRP’s price path through the latter half of the decade. First, regulatory clarity remains paramount. The conclusion of Ripple’s legal proceedings with U.S. regulators will either remove a major overhang or impose new restrictions. Second, institutional adoption drives utility. Increased use of On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) by payment providers directly correlates with XRP demand. Expert Analysis and Quantitative Models Financial modeling firms and blockchain analysts employ various methodologies. Some use discounted cash flow models based on projected transaction fees saved by institutions. Others apply comparative analysis against traditional cross-border settlement costs. Notably, a 2024 report by the Blockchain Research Institute projected that capturing just 1% of the global remittance market could necessitate substantial XRP valuation growth. However, experts caution that linear projections often fail in cryptocurrency markets due to their inherent volatility and disruptive nature. Technological developments on the XRP Ledger also contribute significantly. Upgrades enhancing scalability, smart contract functionality via Hooks, and sustained low transaction costs could expand its use cases beyond payments. This expansion might include tokenized assets and decentralized finance applications, potentially creating new demand vectors. The $5 Question: Scenario Analysis and Probability The prospect of XRP reaching $5 represents a substantial increase from its historical trading range. Achieving this price point implies a market capitalization that would place it among the most valuable digital assets globally. Analysts typically outline three primary scenarios for evaluation. Bullish Scenario: Requires full regulatory resolution favoring Ripple, accelerated global ODL adoption, and a sustained cryptocurrency bull market. In this case, $5 becomes plausible by 2029-2030. Base Case Scenario: Assumes gradual regulatory normalization and steady institutional growth. This path suggests a more moderate climb, potentially reaching between $2.50 and $3.50 by 2030. Conservative Scenario: Envisions ongoing regulatory challenges and slower-than-expected adoption. This could limit significant price appreciation, keeping XRP below the $2 threshold through the decade. Historical resistance levels and on-chain data provide additional context. The $1.50 to $2.00 range has acted as a major psychological and technical barrier multiple times in XRP’s history. A sustained break above this zone would be a critical technical milestone for any long-term rally toward higher targets. Comparative Market Position and Risk Assessment XRP does not exist in a vacuum. Its performance relative to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other payment-focused cryptocurrencies like Stellar Lumens will impact investor perception and capital flows. Moreover, the rise of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) presents both a competitive threat and a potential interoperability opportunity for Ripple’s technology. Key risks extend beyond regulation. Market concentration remains a concern, with a significant portion of XRP held by Ripple Labs itself. The company’s escrow release schedule therefore directly influences circulating supply. Additionally, technological competition is fierce. New blockchain networks offering similar speed and cost advantages emerge regularly, challenging XRP’s first-mover status in institutional payments. Conclusion Predicting XRP’s price through 2026-2030 involves synthesizing complex regulatory, technological, and market signals. While a path to $5 exists under optimal conditions involving full regulatory clarity, massive adoption, and favorable macro trends, it represents an ambitious target requiring multiple aligned factors. Investors should focus on verifiable adoption metrics, regulatory developments, and overall market health rather than speculative price targets. The coming years will ultimately test Ripple’s value proposition in an increasingly crowded and sophisticated digital asset landscape. FAQs Q1: What is the most important factor for XRP’s price growth by 2030? The single most critical factor is clear, favorable regulatory treatment, particularly in the United States and other major economies, which would unlock institutional adoption. Q2: How does Ripple’s escrow of XRP affect the price prediction? The scheduled escrow releases manage supply inflation. Predictable, transparent releases can reduce selling pressure uncertainty, while unexpected changes to the schedule could create volatility. Q3: Can XRP reach $5 without Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs? While possible, it is statistically unlikely. Historically, major altcoin rallies have correlated strongly with Bitcoin strength, as it drives overall market liquidity and sentiment. Q4: What role does banking adoption play in the XRP price prediction? Direct banking use of ODL creates tangible buy-side demand for XRP as a bridge asset. Increased transaction volume from this use case is a fundamental driver of long-term value, not just speculation. Q5: How do predictions for 2026 differ from those for 2030? 2026 predictions are more sensitive to immediate regulatory outcomes and current adoption cycles. 2030 forecasts incorporate longer-term technological integration, potential new use cases, and broader macroeconomic shifts. Q6: Are historical XRP price patterns reliable for future predictions? While technical analysis provides context, cryptocurrency markets evolve rapidly. Past performance, especially pre-2020, may not fully account for today’s institutional involvement and regulatory frameworks, limiting its predictive power.

This decision marked a significant legislative victory that helped alleviate tensions that had arisen earlier between the libertarian leader and his close friend. Sources close to the situation revealed that the manner in which the senators approved Milei’s budget plan was conducted in a general session, with a vote of 46-25. Actually, reliable sources confirmed that this move marks the first time in history since Milei assumed the role of Argentina’s president in 2023. Milei’s 2026 budget plan is set to act as a game-changer for Argentina’s economy Following Milei’s victory , reports mentioned that the voting results demonstrated that several parties agreed with the details in the budget plan. However, despite the proposal being submitted to the Senate and later approved, it is worth noting that Milei faced a significant challenge in Congress following his win in the midterm election. Even with this discovery, several analysts still argued that this scenario presented a great opportunity for the president to showcase his commitment to fostering development in the country and boosting Argentina’s economy . In the meantime, lawmakers have made it clear that they plan to thoroughly examine the labour reform submitted by Milei in February of next year. This budget discussion will provide individuals with an indication of what to expect in the future. What makes the president’s labour reform bill unique is that it enables Milei’s administration to provide debt abroad, apart from typically addressing fiscal policy issues. This takes place under a law from his predecessor that requires approval from Congress to permit foreign bond sales or deals with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Regarding this statement, a recently released financial report highlighted that Argentina has approximately $4.5 billion in debts to bondholders as of January 9. Immediately after the publication of this finding, reporters contacted the current Minister of Economy of Argentina, Luis Caputo, for comment on the claim. Respondingly, Caputo alleged that the government had not yet adopted any plans to sell new bonds overseas in January as a strategy to assist in settling some of these payments. As uncertainties surround the country’s financial conditions in Argentina, several analysts have acknowledged that securing the budget plan’s approval enhances the country’s $20 billion deal with the IMF as 2026 approaches. Hence, assisting Milei in acquiring a fiscal surplus. Concerning the tensions raised earlier between Argentina’s president and some of his other close friends, sources with knowledge of the situation revealed that Milei fueled existing tensions with his friends during the budget process early on. At this particular moment, he attempted to make some adjustments to the funding model for universities and disability initiatives. Notably, the centrist groups expressed their disapproval of these efforts this year. Ultimately, lawmakers in the lower house gave Milei’s budget a green light by eliminating references to these two issues. Argentina faces a market decline impacting its economic growth This month, the relevant authorities in Argentina published the country’s economic data. According to the released data, the country experienced unexpected economic growth despite a market downturn that occurred just before the midterm elections. According to reports from the national statistics agency, Argentina’s economic activity surged by 3.2% in October compared to the same month last year. This growth was lower than the previously estimated 4.2% average, indicating the first decline since June. Month-to-month, this decline was noted to have decreased by 0.4%. Other factors that contributed to this growth were the activities that took place during the period leading up to the October election. For instance, Argentine voters selected half of the lower house of Congress and a third of the Senate in late October. As the election drew nearer, investors expressed growing concern that Milei would not succeed, given his major loss in a local election held in September. This loss led to significant fluctuations in the local financial markets. Moreover, the Argentine peso experienced a decline of around 5% in value during that month.

Perhaps even more importantly for investors who had amassed impressive quantities of the native token, PI also went live for trading. The initial days were quite promising. It skyrocketed to a few consecutive all-time highs, the latest being at the end of February at almost $3.00. However, the hype quickly disappeared, and PI entered a prolonged bear market of its own with just a few deviations and brief spikes. Overall, the asset lost more than 94% of its value by early October when it crashed to an all-time low of $0.172. After some project updates and promising news from the team, it managed to recover some ground and has remained above $0.20 for the past couple of months. Despite the ongoing market uncertainty among all digital assets, PI has maintained a price tag above $0.20, which is a crucial support level. The question is, what will happen in the final week of 2025? Recovery or Breakdown? To get a further perspective on the matter, we asked some of the most popular AI solutions. We will start with ChatGPT, which believes PI is showing some signs of stabilization, but its overall structure remains fragile. It noted that Pi Network’s native token is fundamentally and structurally different than most larger-cap altcoins. The current $0.20 region has acted as a “consistent survival zone,” as the bulls have stepped up every time the asset approached it. However, if it’s broken to the downside, which would be possible if a more violent overall market correction takes place, then the all-time low will come into focus. In contrast, PI might be able to challenge the first immediate resistance at $0.22-$0.24 if buyer activity picks up as it did in late October and November. The Bigger Concerns Gemini and Perplexity outlined a more worrisome bear case, in which PI not only loses the $0.20 support but also crashes below the ATL. Such a vicious nosedive is on the table due to the declining trading volumes and PI’s inability to stage a more permanent comeback. Additionally, repeated tests of the $0.20 support often weaken it over time, which could lead to another breakdown, especially if BTC and the altcoins face another sell-off at the end of the year. In conclusion, the three AIs agreed that PI survived the October/November crash “better than expected,” but its resilience is now being tested again. The $0.20 support will determine how it ends the year. A solid hold might lead to a mild holiday recovery, while a decisive breakdown could lead to a $0.172 retest.

The cryptocurrency market continues its evolution, with Cardano (ADA) remaining a focal point for investors analyzing long-term potential. This analysis provides a detailed, evidence-based Cardano price prediction for 2026 through 2030, specifically examining the feasibility of its native token, ADA, reaching the significant $2 milestone. We will dissect technological developments, macroeconomic factors, and historical data patterns to build a comprehensive outlook. Cardano Price Prediction: Foundation and Methodology Constructing a reliable Cardano price prediction requires a multi-faceted approach. Analysts must consider both on-chain metrics and broader market forces. Consequently, this forecast integrates quantitative data with qualitative assessments of Cardano’s roadmap. The blockchain’s unique proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, Ouroboros, provides a fundamental advantage in energy efficiency. Furthermore, its peer-reviewed development philosophy under Input Output Global (IOG) aims for high assurance and security. Market sentiment, however, often reacts to upgrade deployments and adoption milestones. For instance, the successful implementation of the Alonzo hard fork introduced smart contract capability, a pivotal moment for the network’s utility. Therefore, future price trajectories will likely correlate with the execution of the Basho phase, focused on scaling, and the Voltaire phase, which introduces governance. Key Analytical Pillars for ADA Valuation Several core pillars support any long-term ADA valuation model. First, network adoption metrics like Total Value Locked (TVL) in decentralized applications (dApps) and daily active addresses offer direct utility signals. Second, developer activity on the platform, measured by GitHub commits and project launches, indicates ecosystem health. Third, macroeconomic conditions , including interest rate environments and regulatory clarity, heavily influence capital flows into digital assets. Finally, competitive positioning against Ethereum, Solana, and other smart contract platforms dictates market share. A balanced analysis weighs all these factors without speculative hype. ADA Price Trajectory: 2026 Outlook and Key Drivers The year 2026 represents a critical medium-term horizon for Cardano’s price prediction. By this time, the full rollout of major network upgrades like Hydra for layer-2 scaling should be operational. This scalability solution aims to process thousands of transactions per second. Increased throughput could catalyze broader enterprise and institutional adoption. Moreover, the maturation of the Cardano DeFi and NFT ecosystems will be essential. If real-world use cases in supply chain, digital identity, and education gain traction, demand for ADA could rise substantially. Historical volatility patterns in cryptocurrency also suggest that 2026 may follow a potential market cycle peak in late 2025. Therefore, price action may reflect a consolidation or correction phase, establishing a new support level from which to build. Factor Potential Bullish Impact Potential Bearish Impact Hydra Scaling Significantly lower fees, higher TPS Technical delays or complexities DeFi Growth Increased TVL and user activity Competition from other L1s Regulatory Clarity Institutional investment inflows Restrictive policies hindering growth The 2027 Forecast: Assessing Sustainable Growth Moving into 2027, the Cardano price prediction hinges on sustainable ecosystem growth. The network’s governance model under Voltaire should be fully functional, decentralizing treasury and proposal voting to ADA holders. This could enhance network resilience and community alignment. Analysts often project prices based on discounted cash flow models adapted for crypto, considering staking yield as a form of dividend. With an estimated 2-3% of total supply staked annually, ADA offers a yield-generating aspect. Widespread adoption in emerging markets for financial inclusion projects could also drive unique demand. However, technological obsolescence remains a constant risk in the fast-paced blockchain sector. Continuous innovation and developer retention are paramount for Cardano to maintain its relevance against next-generation platforms. Expert Perspectives on Long-Term Viability Industry experts emphasize utility over pure speculation. Charles Hoskinson, Cardano’s founder, consistently highlights the project’s research-driven approach for long-term sustainability. Meanwhile, analysts from firms like Messari and Coin Bureau point to on-chain data as the ultimate truth teller. They note that while price predictions are inherently uncertain, metrics like network revenue, fee capture, and developer growth provide concrete health indicators. For ADA to approach $2, its market capitalization would need to grow substantially from current levels, implying a significant increase in either token price, circulating supply, or both. This growth must be underpinned by tangible economic activity on the chain, not merely trading volume. 2030 Vision: Can Cardano Realistically Reach $2? The question of ADA hitting $2 by 2030 is a central theme for long-term holders. Achieving this price point depends on a confluence of favorable conditions. First, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization would likely need to expand significantly, with Cardano capturing a maintained or increased share. Second, the successful implementation of its entire roadmap, creating a robust, scalable, and widely-used blockchain, is non-negotiable. Third, global macroeconomic stability and progressive regulatory frameworks would facilitate mainstream adoption. It is a target within the realm of possibility, but it is not guaranteed. It requires the network to transition from a promising platform to a foundational piece of global digital infrastructure. Comparative analysis with Ethereum’s growth trajectory provides a useful, though not definitive, framework. Critical Success Factors for $2 ADA: Mass adoption of Cardano-based digital identities. Dominance in specific verticals like education credentialing. Seamless interoperability with other major blockchains. A thriving, self-sustaining dApp ecosystem with daily utility. Conclusion This Cardano price prediction for 2026, 2027, and 2030 illustrates a path defined by technological execution and market adoption. The journey for ADA to reach $2 is challenging and depends on the network realizing its ambitious scalability and governance goals. While short-term volatility will persist, the long-term thesis for Cardano rests on its methodical, peer-reviewed build-out and growing real-world utility. Investors should focus on fundamental milestones and on-chain metrics rather than price speculation alone. The coming years will be decisive in determining whether Cardano secures a leading position in the decentralized future. FAQs Q1: What is the most important factor for Cardano’s price increase by 2026? The most critical factor is the successful deployment and adoption of scaling solutions like Hydra, which would enable high-throughput, low-cost applications and attract users and developers. Q2: How does Cardano’s staking mechanism affect its long-term price prediction? Staking provides a yield, incentivizing holding and reducing sell-side pressure. A high percentage of staked ADA indicates long-term holder confidence, which can contribute to price stability and gradual appreciation. Q3: What are the biggest risks to this Cardano price prediction? Key risks include intense competition from other smart contract platforms, potential security vulnerabilities, significant delays in roadmap execution, and adverse global regulatory changes impacting the entire crypto sector. Q4: Could ADA hit $2 before 2030? It is possible in a scenario of extreme bullish market cycles and accelerated Cardano adoption. However, a steady, fundamental growth trajectory aligned with technological milestones makes the 2028-2030 timeframe a more common analytical projection. Q5: Where can I find reliable data to track Cardano’s progress? Reliable data sources include Cardano blockchain explorers like CardanoScan, analytics platforms such as Messari and IntoTheBlock, and the official Essential Cardano development update repository published by IOG.

He reiterated that the token could rise to $7,000 or even as high as $9,000 in early 2026 and eventually reach $20,000 in the years to come. Speaking on the Power Lunch episode, he explained that Wall Street’s push to tokenise everything would play directly into Ethereum’s strengths. He said, “It will bring use cases forward for Ethereum.” Lee had claimed Ethereum could surpass Bitcoin Lee stated that the overall crypto market will continue to hold up well for the next five to ten years, even as Bitcoin continues to work through its “gold envy” phase and the fallout from liquidation. Next year, he predicts, the top crypto asset will bounce back and reach an all-time high of $200,000, while Ethereum may peak at $ 9,000. Earlier this month, in November, the Fundstrat founder had argued that Ethereum would eventually dominate the cryptocurrency space, overtaking prominent names such as Bitcoin. He claimed the network’s extensive developer ecosystem and technical resilience set it apart structurally. He added, “I think it’s a true robust community with actual known values, and it’s a neutral blockchain with 100% uptime.” Even then, he maintained that institutional tokenization would contribute to the growth of the network, the claim being that if big institutions hold back from rolling out round-the-clock tokenized equity offerings into the network, others will catch up without delay. At the time, he also said that the token could range between “$7,000–$9,000” by the end of January 2026, blaming the asset’s then decline on the October 10 crypto market crash. Crypto analyst Christopher Perkins had supported Lee’s remarks, affirming that more institutions are turning to the network and tokenisation. He also said most firms will likely prioritize risk management, uptime, and security for their blockchain of use. Sharplink’s Chalom says Ethereum’s TVL could increase ten times in 2026 On Friday, Sharplink’s co-CEO, Joseph Chalom, also shared a more bullish outlook on Ethereum, predicting that its total value locked will grow tenfold in 2026, following the growth of institutions and applications that join the pool. Typically, a rise in TVL indicates increased network participation and hints at potential price implications. Currently, the network’s TVL stands at approximately $68 billion, and with about 797,704 ETH holdings, Sharplink Gaming now ranks as the second-largest public Ethereum treasury firm. Chalom also projects that the stablecoin market will reach $500 billion by the end of next year. He asserted that the crypto community can expect an increasing use of global stablecoins, including cross-border remittances, retail payments, and institutional transactions, with Ethereum becoming the fundamental settlement layer for value movement. Furthermore, he anticipates that more large players will enter the market next year. He added that tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) could surpass $300 billion by 2026, largely due to heightened engagement from major asset managers and banks, including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Franklin Templeton, and BlackRock. Moreover, he said sovereign wealth funds will increase their ETH holdings by five to ten times as tokenisation increases, and Ethereum remains the trust foundation for most blockchain innovation. Most wealth funds favour the network for its “ubiquity and time-tested nature,” he contended. He also believes more onchain AI agents and prediction markets will be integrated on mainstream platforms, increasing network activity and TVL in 2026.

However, some analysts have suggested that the cryptocurrency’s bleeding may not be over and a move to lower levels looms. Related Reading: Bitcoin Poised For ‘Boring’ 2025 Close – Here’s When BTC’s Real Test Will Come Dogecoin Chart Signals Short-Term Caution On Friday, Dogecoin saw another 4.2% intraday decline to from the $0.126 area amid the ongoing market volatility. The cryptocurrency has retraced over 50% from the early October highs, losing multiple key support zones in the past two months. After losing the $0.135 level nearly two weeks ago, DOGE has been the $0.120-$0.135 price range, failing to break past the range’s high despite various attempts. Now, the largest memecoin by market capitalization is attempting to hold the crucial $0.120 support zone to prevent further bleeding. Therefore, some market observers have advised caution during the last week of the year. In an X post, analyst More Crypto Online affirmed that Dogecoin “is still a falling knife” as it appears that its corrective move is not done yet. “There’s no evidence that wave B has bottomed,” he explained, which suggests that a 20% drop toward the next key supports, the $0.096 and $0.08 levels, could be likely. Per the post, “Caution is recommended until the price shows a first micro 5-wave move to the upside.” Similarly, analyst Crypto Jobs warned that investors should stay cautious as Dogecoin does not display a bullish reversal structure and has weak buying volume, unlike multiple other altcoins. He explained that momentum is bearish despite holding the key $0.12 level, adding that, as long as DOGE’s price stays under the $0.14-$0.15 area, bulls won’t be in control and the bearish set up and downtrend structure will remain intact. No buy pressure at the moment, without volume. No bull structure… Under the main downtrend & channel, seeing another dump toward the $0.100 – $0.09500 lower support looks realistic. Sideway phase ongoing on the short term [H4 outlook]. We may also see some bullish move before a possible next wave downward. DOGE’s Price Breakdown Imminent? Market watcher BitGuru considers that DOGE’s deep correction is completed. He pointed out that the cryptocurrency is currently sitting in a major demand zone, between the $0.120-$0.130 levels, where liquidity has already been swept. Based on this, he forecasted that a reclaim of the late November levels could set the stage for a recovery rally toward the $0.18 resistance. On the contrary, failing to hold the current levels would hint that Dogecoin will continue in a prolonged consolidation phase. Meanwhile, Trader Tardigrade highlighted that the cryptocurrency’s price has reached the target of its previous symmetrical triangle pattern after breaking down from the formation earlier this month. Related Reading: More Pain For Ethereum? Head And Shoulder Pattern Signals $2,400 Breakdown Now, Dogecoin is forming a new pattern and “searching for a new trend,” he added. According to the trader, DOGE has been forming another symmetrical triangle pattern on the H4 chart over the past two weeks, which could resolve in a 15% move toward a bearish or bullish trend. Notably, Friday’s pullback sent the cryptocurrency below the pattern’s lower boundary, which sits around the $0.123 mark, signaling that a drop toward the $0.10-$0.11 area is possible if price doesn’t bounce soon. As of this writing, Dogecoin trades at $0.122, a 7.3% decline in the weekly timeframe.

Instead of opening with price targets or technical analysis, the focus is placed on a wide market shift that could define the next phase of the cycle. According to the analyst, the current behavior of silver and gold offers an early clue to what may eventually unfold across Bitcoin and the crypto market, including XRP. Silver and Gold Signal an Overheated Phase CryptoBull highlights that precious metals are displaying characteristics of an aggressive late-stage rally. The attached chart of silver shows a steep advance, with prices pushing toward the upper end of the displayed range near the $70 level per ounce. Silver is showing us what a blow off top looks like. So does gold. Bitcoin and crypto in general is behind. The biggest part of the #XRP gains are still ahead of us! pic.twitter.com/RoOqZFexv0 — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) December 23, 2025 Gold, in the analyst’s view, is exhibiting a similar pattern. This kind of rapid acceleration is interpreted as a sign that capital has heavily concentrated in metals, driving prices higher at a pace that often precedes exhaustion. Rather than viewing this as a warning for metals alone, CryptoBull presents it as evidence of where liquidity is currently flowing. The implication is that when one segment of the market reaches such an advanced stage, attention and capital may eventually rotate elsewhere. Bitcoin and Crypto Still Playing Catch-Up In contrast, Bitcoin and the broader crypto market are described as lagging behind this move. The accompanying Bitcoin chart shows BTC trading around the mid-$80,000 region after pulling back from recent highs, suggesting consolidation rather than the kind of vertical advance seen in silver. For CryptoBull, this gap is meaningful. It suggests that digital assets have not yet experienced the same late-cycle surge that precious metals appear to be undergoing. From this perspective, the current underperformance is not viewed as a weakness but as an indication that crypto may still have room to run once liquidity begins to shift away from metals. XRP Positioned for Its Strongest Phase A central part of CryptoBull’s outlook is XRP . The analyst argues that most of XRP’s gains in this cycle are still ahead, implying that the asset has yet to enter its most decisive upward phase. Within the broader narrative, XRP is presented as a beneficiary of a future rotation, where capital moves from overheated markets into lagging ones. This view aligns XRP with the idea that timing matters as much as direction. If metals are indeed nearing an advanced stage, XRP’s opportunity may lie in what comes next rather than what has already occurred. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Liquidity, Patience, and the Longer View An additional comment from X user Mariwen reinforces the analyst’s view. Mariwen notes that liquidity is presently concentrated in precious metals, which naturally leaves crypto trailing for a period. From this standpoint, there is no urgency to chase short-term moves. Instead, patience is emphasized, with the belief that those who endure through the quieter phases are better positioned for the eventual shift. Together, these perspectives present a coherent narrative: precious metals are leading, crypto is waiting its turn, and XRP may be among the assets with the most ground still to cover when that turn arrives.

This comprehensive examination explores evidence-based Bitcoin price predictions for 2026 through 2030, drawing from historical patterns, technological developments, and macroeconomic indicators that shape cryptocurrency valuations. Bitcoin Price Prediction Methodology and Historical Context Analysts employ multiple methodologies when forecasting Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Historical price action provides crucial context, particularly regarding Bitcoin’s four-year halving cycles. The 2024 halving reduced mining rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC per block, historically triggering supply shock effects approximately 12-18 months later. Consequently, many predictions for 2026 consider this delayed impact alongside growing institutional participation. Traditional financial models increasingly incorporate Bitcoin analysis. For instance, stock-to-flow models compare Bitcoin’s circulating supply against annual production. Meanwhile, network value metrics assess user adoption rates and transaction volumes. These quantitative approaches combine with qualitative factors like regulatory developments and technological upgrades to form comprehensive forecasts. Institutional Adoption as a Primary Catalyst Major financial institutions have significantly increased Bitcoin exposure since 2023. Spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in multiple jurisdictions created new investment pathways. BlackRock, Fidelity, and other asset managers now offer Bitcoin investment products to traditional investors. This institutional infrastructure development suggests sustained demand growth through 2026 and beyond. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2026: Post-Halving Maturation Phase The year 2026 represents a critical period in Bitcoin’s development cycle. Historical data indicates that post-halving bull markets typically peak 12-18 months after halving events. Therefore, 2026 could represent either the latter stages of a bull market or the beginning of consolidation, depending on broader economic conditions. Several factors will influence Bitcoin’s 2026 price trajectory: Macroeconomic environment: Interest rate policies and inflation trends significantly impact risk assets Regulatory clarity: Clearer cryptocurrency regulations could enhance institutional participation Technological developments: Layer-2 solutions and privacy enhancements may increase utility Global adoption metrics: User growth in emerging markets provides demand indicators Analysts reference previous cycles while acknowledging unique contemporary factors. The 2016-2017 bull market saw approximately 100x growth from cycle lows, while the 2020-2021 cycle produced roughly 20x gains. More moderate growth percentages appear likely for future cycles as Bitcoin’s market capitalization expands. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2027-2028: Network Effect Acceleration The 2027-2028 period may demonstrate Bitcoin’s evolving role in global finance. Increasing integration with traditional financial systems could drive price discovery through new mechanisms. Central bank digital currency developments might create Bitcoin interoperability opportunities or competitive pressures. Network effects become increasingly significant during this period. Metcalfe’s Law suggests a network’s value grows proportionally to the square of its users. Bitcoin’s user base expansion, particularly in regions experiencing currency instability, could drive substantial valuation increases. Additionally, Lightning Network adoption for everyday transactions might enhance Bitcoin’s utility beyond store-of-value applications. Bitcoin Adoption Metrics Comparison 2023-2028 Projections Metric 2023 Baseline 2028 Projection Active Addresses ~1 million daily ~3-5 million daily Institutional Holdings ~3% of supply ~8-12% of supply Payment Integration Limited merchant adoption Major retail chains accepting Layer-2 Transactions Thousands daily Millions daily Technological Infrastructure Development Bitcoin’s underlying technology continues evolving through community-driven improvements. Taproot upgrades enhanced privacy and smart contract capabilities. Future protocol developments might address scalability challenges while maintaining decentralization principles. These technological advancements could increase Bitcoin’s utility and consequently its valuation. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2029-2030: Maturation and Mainstream Integration The 2029-2030 timeframe represents Bitcoin’s potential transition toward mainstream financial asset status. By this period, Bitcoin will have completed approximately five halving cycles, providing substantial historical data for analysis. Previous cryptocurrency market patterns suggest potential stabilization as adoption reaches critical mass. Several scenarios could unfold during this period: Global reserve asset status: Bitcoin might function as digital gold in national reserves Inflation hedge validation: Decades of data could confirm Bitcoin’s inflation resistance Technological obsolescence concerns: Quantum computing or superior technologies might emerge Regulatory harmonization: International cryptocurrency standards could develop Demographic factors also influence long-term predictions. Younger generations show greater cryptocurrency acceptance than older cohorts. As wealth transfers between generations, cryptocurrency allocations within investment portfolios might increase substantially. This intergenerational shift could drive sustained demand through 2030. Environmental and Social Considerations Bitcoin mining’s energy consumption remains a significant discussion point. However, mining increasingly utilizes renewable energy sources and stranded power. By 2030, Bitcoin mining might achieve carbon neutrality through technological innovations and regulatory requirements. This environmental progress could remove a major barrier to institutional adoption. Comparative Analysis with Traditional Assets Bitcoin’s performance relative to traditional assets provides important context for predictions. Since its inception, Bitcoin has significantly outperformed major stock indices, commodities, and bonds on annualized return metrics. However, this outperformance comes with substantially higher volatility. Portfolio theory suggests optimal Bitcoin allocations between 1-5% for risk-adjusted returns. As Bitcoin’s volatility potentially decreases with market maturation, optimal allocations might increase. Institutional portfolio managers increasingly recognize Bitcoin’s diversification benefits despite correlation fluctuations with traditional assets. Risk Factors and Prediction Limitations All cryptocurrency price predictions contain inherent uncertainties. Several risk factors could substantially alter Bitcoin’s trajectory: Regulatory interventions: Hostile regulatory environments in major economies Technological vulnerabilities: Critical protocol flaws or security breaches Market structure risks: Exchange failures or liquidity crises Macroeconomic shocks: Global financial crises or monetary system changes Competitive pressures: Superior cryptocurrency or digital asset emergence Prediction models acknowledge these uncertainties through scenario analysis rather than precise price targets. Responsible analysis presents ranges and probabilities rather than definitive predictions, emphasizing that cryptocurrency investments carry substantial risk. Conclusion Bitcoin price predictions for 2026 through 2030 reflect both optimism and caution based on evolving evidence. The cryptocurrency’s trajectory will likely depend on continued institutional adoption, technological development, regulatory clarity, and macroeconomic conditions. While historical patterns provide guidance, Bitcoin’s unique characteristics ensure an unpredictable journey. Investors should approach long-term Bitcoin price predictions with careful research, risk management, and awareness of cryptocurrency’s inherent volatility. The coming years will test Bitcoin’s resilience and potentially solidify its position within global financial systems. FAQs Q1: What factors most influence Bitcoin’s long-term price predictions? Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory depends primarily on adoption rates, regulatory developments, macroeconomic conditions, technological advancements, and institutional participation levels. Network security and hash rate stability also contribute significantly. Q2: How reliable are Bitcoin price prediction models? Prediction models provide probabilistic scenarios rather than guarantees. While historical patterns and quantitative models offer insights, cryptocurrency markets remain influenced by unpredictable technological, regulatory, and macroeconomic developments. Q3: Does Bitcoin’s halving cycle guarantee price increases? Historical data shows correlation between halving events and subsequent price appreciation, but causation isn’t guaranteed. Previous cycles occurred within different macroeconomic contexts and adoption stages, limiting predictive certainty. Q4: What percentage of investment portfolios might include Bitcoin by 2030? Financial advisors increasingly recommend 1-5% cryptocurrency allocations for diversified portfolios. By 2030, institutional adoption could push average allocations toward the higher end of this range, depending on volatility reduction and regulatory clarity. Q5: How might quantum computing affect Bitcoin’s long-term value? Quantum computing could potentially threaten Bitcoin’s cryptographic security. However, the Bitcoin development community actively researches quantum-resistant solutions, and any transition would likely occur gradually with community consensus.

This article explores whether KAS is set to lead a new trend and highlights other coins poised for potential growth. Readers will gain insights into what sets KAS apart during these stagnant times. Kaspa (KAS) Eyes Potential Comeback with Recent Price Action Source: tradingview Kaspa's price currently hovers between a little over $0.042 and just under $0.050. It is flirting with its short-term resistance level of $0.052. If it breaks past this, the next target could be close to six cents, an increase of around 20% from its current upper price range. Although it has seen a drop of over 10% in the past month, recent weekly gains of nearly 12% show signs of a potential uptrend. Its RSI indicates it's neither overbought nor oversold, which suggests balanced market conditions. Kaspa's price is sticking close to its 10-day moving average, hinting at stability and a possible bounce back. Conclusion KAS maintains its position while the broader crypto market shows signs of hesitation. This steady performance suggests potential for continued growth. In contrast, other cryptocurrencies remain in a holding pattern, indicating potential volatility ahead. Assessing KAS's stability in comparison to other coins reinforces optimism for its future trajectory. The trend is aligned with market anticipation, suggesting that KAS's current strength might lead to further upward movement. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

These standout cryptos are defying the trend and catching the eye of investors. This article dives into which coins are poised for potential growth despite the overall slump, offering a glimpse into market opportunities that can't be ignored. Monero (XMR): Privacy-Driven Gem Poised for The Next Altcoin Wave Monero (XMR) stands out as a top choice for privacy-conscious users. It was created in 2014, focusing on anonymous transactions by hiding sender, receiver, and transaction amounts. This privacy edge gives it an advantage as digital freedom becomes a bigger concern. The tech behind XMR makes tracking movements near impossible, protecting users from prying eyes. As we anticipate a new bull run and altcoin season, Monero's constant improvements and strong community make it attractive. Demand for privacy is rising, which positions Monero well in this cycle. It's a coin to watch for future gains. Litecoin: Set to Shine Bright in the Upcoming Altcoin Season Litecoin , often dubbed the silver to Bitcoin's gold, is a seasoned player in the crypto space. With faster transaction times and a robust network, LTC might be ready for the limelight again. Its longevity in the market shows its staying power. The coin uses a technology similar to Bitcoin but offers quicker confirmation times, making it a useful payment option. In this current market dip, Litecoin's strong fundamentals could make it a standout choice for investors looking for altcoins with potential. As patterns from 2021 suggest, altcoin seasons follow Bitcoin dumps, positioning Litecoin as an attractive option in this cycle. UNI Could Shine Bright in the Upcoming Altcoin Season Uniswap's UNI token could be a star performer in the next altcoin season. Uniswap is a popular decentralized exchange built on the Ethereum platform. It allows users to swap various cryptocurrencies without needing a centralized authority. This makes it a favorite among crypto enthusiasts who value privacy and transparency. Despite recent market downturns, history suggests that UNI often rises stronger afterward. Its technology and easy user experience could drive higher adoption and demand. If the market turns bullish again, UNI’s unique features and strong user base could make it an attractive choice for investors looking to capitalize on the new cycle. Conclusion XMR, LTC, and UNI have shown strength despite the overall market's weakness. These coins have managed to perform well where others have struggled. This resilience indicates potential for further growth and stability. It is crucial to keep an eye on them as they navigate through the current market conditions. Their performance might offer interesting opportunities for those looking to invest in stable options during these times. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While volatility once felt like part of the game, user expectations have shifted. Today, speed and predictability matter more than speculation — and that’s where stablecoins and instant payouts are changing everything. More players now prefer to bet with USDT, not because it’s trendy, but because it removes friction. Stable value, faster settlement, and clearer bankroll control are quietly redefining how modern crypto betting platforms operate. Why Stablecoins Became Central to Crypto Betting Bitcoin introduced decentralized betting. Stablecoins made it practical. For a long time, crypto betting meant accepting price swings as part of the experience. A winning bet could lose value within minutes, especially during volatile markets. Stablecoins removed that uncertainty. This shift didn’t happen overnight, but the logic is simple: when the value of your balance stays the same, decision-making improves. Bettors focus on odds, timing, and strategy — not on whether their winnings will still be worth the same tomorrow. That’s why USDT sports betting has grown faster than any other crypto betting segment. What Actually Changes When You Bet With USDT? At first glance, betting with USDT looks identical to betting with Bitcoin or Ethereum. But the experience feels different almost immediately. Here’s how the flow typically works on a modern USDT betting site: You deposit a stablecoin with a fixed value You place bets without worrying about market swings Winnings are settled instantly in the same currency Withdrawals arrive with no conversion delays That stability removes mental overhead. It also makes bonuses, cashback, and promotions easier to understand — a small but important detail for active bettors. Instant Payouts: From Advantage to Expectation There was a time when “fast withdrawals” were used as a marketing hook. That time is gone. In crypto betting today, instant payouts are not impressive — they’re expected. Stablecoins make this possible at scale. Because USDT transactions are liquid, predictable, and supported across multiple networks, platforms can automate settlement without manual checks. This matters most in live betting, where timing is everything. If a platform delays payouts in a stablecoin environment, users notice immediately. How Stablecoins Are Reshaping Sports Betting Infrastructure Stablecoins don’t just benefit users. They change how sportsbooks are built internally. With USDT betting, platforms can calculate odds more precisely, manage liquidity without volatility buffers, and offer fixed-value cashback programs. The result is a smoother system that reacts faster during peak events. This is one reason many newer crypto sportsbooks are designed around stablecoins first — and volatile assets second. Dexsport and the Shift Toward Stablecoin-First Betting One platform that illustrates this shift clearly is Dexsport . Dexsport integrates stablecoins directly into its sportsbook and casino ecosystem. Users can place bets, receive bonuses, and withdraw winnings in USDT across multiple networks — without KYC barriers or conversion risk. What stands out here is not just speed, but consistency. Cashback is paid in stablecoins. Live betting settlements preserve value. Cash Out decisions lock in exact amounts rather than fluctuating estimates. For users who want to bet with USDT and keep full control over their funds, this approach feels closer to decentralized finance than traditional gambling. Are Stablecoins Actually Safer for Crypto Betting? This question comes up often — and the answer depends on what “safer” means. Stablecoins reduce price volatility, but they don’t eliminate platform risk. Security still depends on licensing, custody, and transparency. What stablecoins do offer is clarity. When users always know the exact value of their balance, risk becomes easier to manage. In practice, that clarity builds confidence — especially for frequent bettors. Mobile Crypto Betting and Stablecoins Stablecoins also pair naturally with mobile crypto betting. On smaller screens, simplicity matters. Fixed balances are easier to track, payouts are easier to verify, and live betting decisions feel more intuitive. This is why many USDT betting platforms prioritize mobile web experiences with direct wallet interaction rather than complex native apps. What This Shift Means Going Forward Crypto betting is moving toward a new baseline: stablecoin-first liquidity instant settlement as standard wallet-based control over funds Volatility-driven betting won’t disappear, but it’s no longer the default. Platforms that integrate stablecoins deeply — rather than as an afterthought — are setting the pace. Final Thoughts Stablecoins and instant payouts aren’t just new features. They are reshaping how crypto betting works at a fundamental level. For players, betting with stablecoins offers stability and speed. For platforms, it enables automation and trust. And for ecosystems like Dexsport, it creates a betting experience where value stays predictable — even when the game isn’t. In the next phase of crypto betting, stability isn’t a limitation. It’s the foundation.",More News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-12-27 06:22:35
56436179,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=254582,1766816710,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio Reveals Critical Market Equilibrium Across Top Exchanges,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/btc-perpetual-futures-ratio-analysis/,"BitcoinWorld BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio Reveals Critical Market Equilibrium Across Top Exchanges Global cryptocurrency markets on March 15, 2025, witnessed a remarkable equilibrium in Bitcoin derivatives trading as the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio across the world’s three largest exchanges settled at an almost perfect balance, signaling sophisticated market maturity and providing crucial insights for institutional and retail traders navigating volatile conditions. BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio Analysis The 24-hour BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio data reveals a market in near-perfect equilibrium. Across Binance, OKX, and Bybit, the aggregated position ratio shows 49.49% long positions versus 50.51% short positions. This remarkable balance indicates neither bulls nor bears have established clear dominance in current market conditions. Market analysts consider this equilibrium particularly significant given Bitcoin’s recent price volatility and the growing institutional participation in cryptocurrency derivatives markets. Perpetual futures contracts represent one of the most popular cryptocurrency derivatives products. Unlike traditional futures with expiration dates, perpetual futures continue indefinitely with funding rates periodically exchanged between long and short positions. The long/short ratio therefore serves as a crucial sentiment indicator, revealing trader positioning and potential market direction. When analyzed across multiple exchanges, this data provides a comprehensive view of global market sentiment rather than exchange-specific anomalies. Exchange-Specific Breakdown and Market Implications Detailed examination of individual exchange data reveals subtle variations in trader behavior across platforms. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, shows the most balanced ratio at 50.34% long versus 49.66% short. This near-perfect equilibrium on the largest platform suggests institutional traders may be employing sophisticated hedging strategies rather than taking directional bets. OKX demonstrates the most pronounced bearish tilt among the three exchanges with 48.15% long positions against 51.85% short positions. Meanwhile, Bybit shows a similar but slightly less pronounced bearish bias at 48.92% long versus 51.08% short. These variations likely reflect different user demographics, regional trading patterns, and platform-specific features influencing trader behavior. BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio Comparison Exchange Long Positions Short Positions Net Bias Binance 50.34% 49.66% Slightly Bullish OKX 48.15% 51.85% Bearish Bybit 48.92% 51.08% Bearish Aggregate 49.49% 50.51% Neutral/Slightly Bearish Several factors contribute to these exchange-specific variations: User demographics: Different exchanges attract distinct trader profiles Regional concentration: Geographic distribution affects trading patterns Leverage options: Varying maximum leverage influences position sizing Funding rate mechanisms: Slight differences in how exchanges calculate funding Historical Context and Market Evolution The current equilibrium represents a significant evolution from earlier cryptocurrency market cycles. During the 2021 bull market, long/short ratios frequently showed extreme bullish biases exceeding 70% long positions. Conversely, during major corrections, short positions sometimes dominated at similar extreme levels. The current balanced ratio suggests several market developments: First, increased institutional participation has brought more sophisticated risk management practices to cryptocurrency markets. Professional traders frequently employ delta-neutral strategies and hedging that naturally balance long and short exposure. Second, regulatory developments in major jurisdictions have encouraged more measured positioning rather than speculative extremes. Finally, the maturation of cryptocurrency derivatives products has provided traders with more tools to express nuanced views rather than simple directional bets. Technical Analysis and Trading Strategy Implications From a technical analysis perspective, balanced long/short ratios often precede significant price movements. When neither bulls nor bears dominate positioning, markets become particularly sensitive to new information and catalysts. Traders monitor several key indicators alongside the long/short ratio: Funding rates: The periodic payments between long and short positions Open interest: Total value of outstanding derivative contracts Liquidations: Forced position closures at specific price levels Volume patterns: Trading activity supporting price movements Current funding rates across major exchanges remain relatively neutral, typically ranging between -0.01% and 0.01% per eight-hour funding period. This neutrality suggests neither side faces excessive funding costs that might force position unwinding. However, traders remain vigilant for funding rate spikes that could indicate growing positioning imbalances. Risk Management Considerations for 2025 The balanced BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio carries important risk management implications. First, balanced positioning reduces the likelihood of cascading liquidations that occur when extreme positioning meets adverse price movements. Second, neutral sentiment often precedes volatility expansion as markets seek catalysts for directional movement. Third, the equilibrium suggests options markets might offer attractive pricing for volatility strategies rather than directional bets. Seasoned derivatives traders often interpret balanced ratios as opportunities for range-bound strategies while preparing for potential breakout scenarios. Many employ options strategies like straddles or strangles that profit from significant price movement in either direction. Others implement dynamic hedging approaches that adjust exposure based on changing ratio data and other sentiment indicators. Regulatory Environment and Institutional Adoption The 2025 cryptocurrency regulatory landscape significantly influences derivatives trading patterns. Recent regulatory clarity in several major jurisdictions has encouraged more institutional participation while implementing safeguards against excessive leverage and position concentration. Key regulatory developments affecting BTC perpetual futures markets include: Enhanced reporting requirements for large positions Leverage limits in certain jurisdictions Improved custody solutions for institutional participants Standardized risk disclosure requirements across platforms These developments have contributed to more measured positioning compared to previous market cycles. Institutional participants, now representing approximately 45% of Bitcoin derivatives volume according to recent industry reports, typically employ more balanced approaches than retail traders during earlier bull markets. Their participation has increased market depth while reducing extreme sentiment swings in positioning data. Conclusion The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio across Binance, OKX, and Bybit reveals a cryptocurrency derivatives market achieving unprecedented equilibrium in early 2025. This balanced positioning reflects market maturation, increased institutional participation, and evolving regulatory frameworks. While individual exchanges show slight variations in trader sentiment, the aggregate data indicates neither bulls nor bears have established clear dominance. Market participants should interpret this equilibrium as evidence of sophisticated risk management rather than indecision, while remaining prepared for potential volatility expansion as new catalysts emerge. The BTC perpetual futures market continues evolving toward greater efficiency and institutional integration, with long/short ratios serving as crucial indicators of this ongoing transformation. FAQs Q1: What does the BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio indicate about market sentiment? The ratio shows nearly balanced positioning between bullish and bearish traders, suggesting neither side has established clear dominance. This equilibrium often indicates sophisticated risk management and can precede increased volatility as markets seek directional catalysts. Q2: Why do long/short ratios vary between different cryptocurrency exchanges? Variations result from differences in user demographics, regional concentrations, leverage options, and platform-specific features. Institutional-heavy platforms often show more balanced ratios than retail-dominated exchanges during certain market conditions. Q3: How do perpetual futures differ from traditional futures contracts? Perpetual futures lack expiration dates and use funding rate mechanisms to maintain price alignment with spot markets. Traditional futures have set expiration dates and settle based on predetermined settlement procedures at contract maturity. Q4: What trading strategies work well during balanced long/short ratio conditions? Range-bound strategies, volatility plays using options, and dynamic hedging approaches often perform well during balanced conditions. Many traders implement strategies that profit from volatility expansion rather than directional bets during such periods. Q5: How has institutional participation affected BTC perpetual futures markets? Institutional involvement has increased market depth, improved liquidity, and encouraged more sophisticated risk management. Professional traders often employ hedging strategies that contribute to more balanced long/short ratios compared to earlier retail-dominated market cycles.

While thousands of platforms now advertise themselves as the best cryptocurrency casino, only a smaller group can actually explain how they protect player funds, verify outcomes, and operate under clear legal frameworks. In 2026, security in a cryptocurrency online casino is no longer about flashy bonuses or massive game counts. It comes down to three fundamentals: licensing, custody, and fair play. Miss one of them, and trust starts to crack. This guide breaks down what real security looks like in modern crypto casinos , how different platforms approach it, and why some models are clearly more resilient than others. What Makes a Cryptocurrency Casino Truly Secure? Security in crypto gambling is layered. There is no single checkbox that turns a casino into a safe one. A secure casino with cryptocurrency typically combines several elements at once: A valid gambling license with defined operating rules Clear custody logic showing who controls user funds Transparent game mechanics and settlement processes Operational maturity under real user load Here’s the question many players don’t ask early enough:Is a large game library still valuable if custody and transparency are unclear? In practice, security failures usually happen after a win — not during gameplay. That’s why the underlying structure matters more than surface features. Licensing in Cryptocurrency Casinos — What It Really Guarantees Licensing is often misunderstood in the crypto casino space. A license does not make a platform “risk-free,” but it does create accountability. Most established cryptocurrency online casinos operate under international licenses such as Curaçao or Anjouan. These jurisdictions allow crypto gambling while enforcing baseline standards. What licensing typically provides: Defined ownership and operator responsibility Published rules for bonuses and withdrawals A formal framework for handling disputes What it does not guarantee: Instant payouts in every situation Zero risk for players Protection from poor bankroll management In other words, licensing sets the floor — not the ceiling. Custody Models — Who Actually Controls Your Funds? Custody is where crypto casinos differ most from traditional platforms. At a high level, there are three common models: Fully custodial casinosUser funds are stored and controlled entirely by the platform. Hybrid custody platformsDeposits are held by the casino, but withdrawals are automated and faster. Wallet-first or non-custodial modelsUsers retain direct control through wallets or on-chain settlement logic. The third model is becoming more common in cryptocurrency casino integration, especially among platforms built natively for Web3 users. It reduces counterparty risk but also shifts responsibility to the player. Security improves — but only if users understand how wallets and transactions work. Dexsport — A Security-First Approach to Crypto Casino Design Among modern crypto casinos, Dexsport represents a wallet-first, transparency-driven model focused on minimizing trust assumptions. Instead of relying on heavy account systems, Dexsport allows instant access through: email or Telegram sign-up DeFi wallets such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet No routine KYC is required, and user funds move directly through blockchain networks. This approach reduces custodial exposure and shortens the path between wager and settlement. From a security standpoint, Dexsport combines: official licensing under the Government of the Autonomous Island of Anjouan independent smart contract audits on-chain bet logging with public visibility This structure does not eliminate risk — but it makes the rules visible. And visibility is the foundation of trust in any best cryptocurrency online casino. Different Security Models in Practice: How Major Platforms Compare Security in crypto casinos isn’t standardized. Each platform emphasizes different trade-offs. Stake — Scale and Operational Maturity Stake relies on reputation, liquidity, and long-term operational history. Its custodial model is offset by fast withdrawals, strong provider partnerships, and a large user base that stress-tests systems daily. Security here comes from scale and consistency rather than decentralization. Wild.io — Rewards Within a Traditional Framework Wild.io follows a more classic crypto casino structure, combining licensed operation with provably fair games and a generous bonus system. Custody remains centralized, but withdrawals are processed quickly, and the platform benefits from well-established game providers. BetMode — On-Chain Transparency as a Core Feature BetMode pushes security toward verifiability. Results are recorded on-chain, rakeback is calculated in real time, and users can observe how outcomes are generated. This model appeals to players who prioritize transparency over sheer game volume. Each approach works — but for different types of users. Fair Play in Crypto Casinos — From RNG to On-Chain Verification Fair play is more than random number generators and third-party certificates. Traditional crypto casinos rely on: certified RNGs game provider audits internal settlement systems More advanced platforms move toward: provably fair mechanics on-chain bet records verifiable outcomes visible to users Transparency doesn’t remove risk — it removes blind trust. This distinction matters most in live games and high-volume betting, where confidence in settlement logic becomes just as important as the game itself. Live Casino Security — When Real Dealers Enter the Picture Security requirements change in a cryptocurrency live casino. Live games introduce: video streaming integrity real-time result transmission latency-sensitive settlement Key factors that affect trust in live casino environments include: reputation of live game providers stream reliability and delay clear rules for result confirmation Here, platform stability matters as much as cryptography. Mobile Access and Security in Crypto Casinos The rise of the cryptocurrency mobile casino adds another layer of complexity. Most platforms now favor secure mobile web access over native apps. This allows: direct wallet signing fewer attack surfaces faster updates without app store delays However, mobile access also increases phishing risks, making user awareness part of the security equation. Where Secure Cryptocurrency Casinos Are Heading The future of crypto casinos isn’t about more games — it’s about clearer systems. Expect to see: deeper on-chain settlement better custody UX fewer opaque mechanics more visible verification tools Security is shifting from promises to architecture. Final Thoughts A secure cryptocurrency casino is defined by how it handles trust — not how loudly it markets bonuses. Licensing creates accountability. Custody defines risk. Fair play builds confidence. Platforms that align all three stand out as long-term players in the crypto gambling space.

The question of whether ETH can reach $10,000 represents more than mere speculation—it requires examining fundamental blockchain developments, institutional adoption patterns, and macroeconomic factors that will shape cryptocurrency valuations through the coming decade. Ethereum Price Prediction: Analyzing the 2026 Landscape Market analysts project Ethereum’s 2026 price based on several converging factors. First, Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake consensus has fundamentally altered its economic model. The network now burns a portion of transaction fees through EIP-1559, creating deflationary pressure during high-usage periods. According to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, Ethereum’s net issuance turned negative multiple times during 2024 network congestion events. Second, institutional adoption continues accelerating. BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF approval in 2024 marked a watershed moment. Major financial institutions now allocate portions of their digital asset portfolios to ETH. This institutional demand creates substantial buying pressure that could support higher price floors through 2026. Third, layer-2 scaling solutions have achieved remarkable adoption. Arbitrum, Optimism, and emerging zero-knowledge rollups collectively process over 80% of Ethereum transactions while settling finality on the main chain. This scalability breakthrough enables Ethereum to support thousands of transactions per second without compromising decentralization—a critical requirement for mass adoption. Technical Foundations: Ethereum’s 2027 Infrastructure Evolution The Ethereum roadmap outlines several crucial upgrades scheduled for 2026-2027. The Verkle trees implementation will enable stateless clients, dramatically reducing hardware requirements for node operators. Meanwhile, proto-danksharding will increase data availability for rollups by approximately 16 times. These technical improvements address current network limitations while enhancing Ethereum’s competitive position against alternative layer-1 blockchains. Real-world asset tokenization represents another significant growth vector. Major financial institutions including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have launched tokenization platforms built on Ethereum. These platforms convert traditional assets like treasury bonds, real estate, and commodities into blockchain-based tokens. As this sector expands through 2027, Ethereum could capture substantial value from the multi-trillion dollar traditional finance market. Expert Perspectives on Market Dynamics Cryptocurrency research firm Delphi Digital emphasizes Ethereum’s network effects in their 2025 annual report. Their analysis notes that Ethereum’s developer community remains approximately 3.5 times larger than its nearest competitor. This developer advantage creates powerful network effects that compound over time. Additionally, Ethereum’s total value locked in decentralized finance protocols has consistently maintained a 55-60% market share despite intense competition. University researchers from MIT and Stanford published a joint study in 2024 examining blockchain adoption curves. Their mathematical models suggest that if Ethereum maintains its current growth rate in daily active addresses and transaction volume, its network value could increase proportionally. However, these researchers caution that regulatory developments represent the most significant unknown variable affecting all cryptocurrency price predictions. The $10,000 Threshold: 2028-2030 Projection Analysis Reaching $10,000 per ETH requires careful examination of market capitalization mathematics. At current circulating supply levels, this price point would represent approximately a $1.2 trillion market capitalization. For context, gold’s total market value exceeds $12 trillion while global equity markets surpass $100 trillion. Ethereum capturing 1% of gold’s market value would comfortably support a $10,000 price target. Several scenarios could drive Ethereum toward this valuation. First, decentralized social media platforms built on Ethereum could achieve mainstream adoption by 2029. Projects like Farcaster demonstrate how blockchain-based social networks can operate without centralized control. If these platforms attract hundreds of millions of users, they would generate substantial ETH demand for transaction fees and governance participation. Second, central bank digital currency integration might emerge as a significant catalyst. Several central banks have experimented with wholesale CBDCs using Ethereum-based infrastructure. The Bank for International Settlements published a 2024 report detailing how Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities could facilitate cross-border CBDC settlements. Such institutional adoption at the sovereign level would validate Ethereum’s technological robustness while introducing new demand sources. Comparative Blockchain Performance Metrics Metric Ethereum (2024) Projected (2028) Transactions per Second 15-45 (base layer) 100,000+ (with rollups) Daily Active Addresses 400,000-600,000 2,000,000+ Annual Revenue $2.7 billion $15-20 billion Staked ETH Percentage 25% 40-50% This table illustrates Ethereum’s growth trajectory based on current network trends and announced upgrades. The projected metrics assume successful implementation of roadmap elements and continued adoption across key sectors. Risk Factors and Market Considerations While optimistic projections exist, several risk factors warrant consideration. Regulatory uncertainty remains the most significant concern. The SEC’s classification of Ethereum continues evolving, with potential implications for trading accessibility. Additionally, quantum computing advances could theoretically threaten Ethereum’s cryptographic foundations by 2030, though development teams actively research quantum-resistant algorithms. Competition from alternative layer-1 and layer-2 solutions presents another challenge. Solana, Cardano, and emerging blockchain platforms continue innovating with different technical approaches. Ethereum must maintain its development pace to preserve its first-mover advantages. The ecosystem’s response to these challenges will significantly influence long-term price trajectories. Macroeconomic conditions inevitably affect cryptocurrency valuations. Historical data shows correlation between Ethereum’s price and traditional risk assets during certain market periods. Federal Reserve policies, inflation rates, and global economic growth will impact investor risk appetite through 2030. Diversified investment portfolios typically allocate only modest percentages to cryptocurrencies, limiting potential capital inflows during risk-off environments. Conclusion Ethereum price predictions for 2026-2030 require balancing technological progress with market realities. The path to $10,000 depends on multiple factors aligning favorably: continued protocol improvements, expanding real-world use cases, supportive regulatory frameworks, and sustained institutional adoption. While mathematical models suggest this price target remains plausible within the timeframe, investors should consider Ethereum’s fundamental strengths alongside inherent cryptocurrency market volatility. The blockchain’s evolution from smart contract platform to global settlement layer will ultimately determine whether ETH achieves and sustains five-figure valuations through the decade’s end. FAQs Q1: What is the most realistic Ethereum price prediction for 2026? Most analysts project Ethereum trading between $6,000 and $8,500 in 2026, assuming continued adoption of layer-2 solutions and moderate growth in decentralized applications. These predictions consider current network fundamentals and historical growth patterns. Q2: How does Ethereum 2.0 affect long-term price predictions? The complete transition to proof-of-stake consensus reduces Ethereum’s energy consumption by approximately 99.95% while introducing staking rewards. This environmental improvement addresses institutional ESG concerns while creating predictable yield opportunities that could support higher valuations through 2030. Q3: What percentage of cryptocurrency portfolios should include Ethereum? Financial advisors typically recommend 1-5% allocations to cryptocurrencies within diversified portfolios, with Ethereum often representing 40-60% of that crypto allocation. However, individual risk tolerance and investment horizons significantly influence appropriate percentages. Q4: Can Ethereum reach $10,000 before Bitcoin reaches $100,000? Market dynamics suggest these milestones could occur within similar timeframes. Ethereum’s $10,000 target represents approximately a 3x increase from 2024 highs, while Bitcoin’s $100,000 represents roughly a 2x increase. Both targets depend on similar macroeconomic and adoption factors. Q5: What are the biggest threats to Ethereum’s price growth through 2030? Primary threats include regulatory crackdowns in major markets, successful competition from alternative layer-1 blockchains, security vulnerabilities in smart contracts or core protocol, and prolonged cryptocurrency bear markets driven by macroeconomic conditions.

Short-term momentum indicators are improving, suggesting the potential for a relief rally, though the broader trend remains under pressure. Powered by Outset PR , this analysis reflects the agency’s commitment to strategic, data-backed communication for the crypto industry. SOL Defends Multi-Tested Support Source: coinmarketcap SOL recently rebounded from the $118–$120 support zone, an area that has been tested multiple times since November. The repeated defense of this range suggests sellers are losing momentum, reducing downside pressure in the near term. This base has become structurally important, acting as a launch point for short-term recovery attempts rather than a breakdown trigger. Bullish Divergence Emerges on Lower Timeframes Momentum indicators on the 4-hour chart point to improving conditions. The Relative Strength Index formed a bullish divergence, with momentum strengthening despite prior lower price action. At the same time, the MACD histogram has turned positive, signaling a shift in short-term momentum. Together, these signals support the case for a relief rally, particularly if price action confirms the move with follow-through. Resistance Levels Define the Upside The immediate resistance zone sits between $132 and $136. A clean break above this range would strengthen the bullish case and open the path toward the $145 level. A key confirmation to watch is sustained closes above $130. Without this, upside attempts risk fading into another consolidation phase. How Outset PR Leverages Data-Driven Approach in Crypto PR Outset PR connects market events with meaningful storytelling through a data-driven methodology rarely seen in the crypto communications space. Founded by PR strategist Mike Ermolaev, the agency approaches each campaign like a hands-on workshop—building narratives that align with market momentum instead of relying on generic coverage or templated outreach. Beyond just monitoring on-chain flows, Outset PR monitors the media trendlines and traffic distribution through the lens of its proprietary Outset Data Pulse intelligence to determine when a client’s message will achieve the highest lift. This analysis informs the choice of media outlets, the angle of each pitch, and the timing of publication. A key part of the agency’s workflow comes from its proprietary Syndication Map , an internal analytics system that identifies which publications deliver the strongest downstream syndication across aggregators such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square. Because of this approach, Outset PR campaigns frequently achieve visibility several times higher than their initial placements. Outset PR ensures that each campaign is market-fit and tailored to deliver maximum relevance at the moment the audience is most receptive. Solana Price Outlook Solana shows signs of seller exhaustion near a well-established support zone, with bullish divergence supporting short-term upside potential. A breakout above $132–$136 could extend gains toward $145, but sustained closes above $130 are needed to confirm reversal potential. While near-term momentum is improving, the broader trend remains bearish as long as SOL trades below the 200-day SMA. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

What started as simple Bitcoin deposits on traditional sportsbooks has evolved into full no-KYC crypto sports betting platforms built around speed, privacy, and direct control over funds. Today, more players want to bet on sports with crypto without uploading documents, waiting for approvals, or dealing with banking restrictions. And that demand is shaping an entirely new category of sportsbooks. This article explores how sports betting with crypto works today, why no-KYC sportsbooks are gaining traction, and which platforms actually deliver a reliable experience — with a clear focus on modern, crypto-native solutions. Why Sports Betting Using Crypto Is Growing So Fast The appeal of crypto for sports betting is straightforward. Crypto removes intermediaries. Sports betting rewards speed. Put together, the model makes sense. Unlike traditional sportsbooks, crypto-based platforms allow users to deposit, place bets, and withdraw winnings without relying on banks or payment processors. That alone removes delays that frustrate many bettors. But speed isn’t the only reason. Sports betting using crypto is growing because it offers: Greater privacy and reduced data exposure Global access without local banking limits Faster payouts, especially for live betting Wallet-based control over balances For many users, this feels closer to how online services should work. What Does “No-KYC Sports Betting” Actually Mean? Before choosing a platform, it’s important to clarify one thing: not every crypto sportsbook is truly no-KYC. In practice, sportsbooks fall into three groups: Crypto-accepted sportsbooksThese platforms accept crypto deposits but require full verification before withdrawals. Low-KYC crypto sportsbooksBetting starts without verification, but KYC is triggered later. No-KYC crypto sportsbooksWallet-based access with no routine identity checks. For users searching for crypto sports betting no KYC, only the third category delivers consistent privacy. And this is where crypto-native platforms stand out. Dexsport — Best No-KYC Sportsbook for Betting with Crypto Dexsport is a licensed, crypto-native sportsbook and casino built for players who value speed, privacy, and transparency. Instead of adapting legacy betting models to crypto, Dexsport was designed from the ground up for Web3 users — with no KYC, wallet-first access, and on-chain visibility baked into the core experience.

This approach removes the usual black-box feeling associated with crypto casinos and sportsbooks. Results can be verified directly, without relying on vague “provably fair” claims. Transparency isn’t a promise here — it’s part of the interface. Why Dexsport Appeals to Web3 Bettors Many platforms market themselves as “Web3-friendly.” Few actually operate like one. Dexsport stands out by offering: True no-KYC access and full anonymity Broad multi-chain crypto support A combined sportsbook and casino with real depth Transparent bonuses and weekly cashback Fast sign-up via wallet, email, or Telegram No proprietary tokens. No forced ecosystems. Just direct access, clear rules, and control in the hands of the player. Advantages and Trade-Offs of Sports Betting Using Crypto No-KYC crypto betting isn’t perfect. It changes the balance between freedom and responsibility. Advantages: faster onboarding stronger privacy global access full control over funds Trade-offs: fewer formal dispute channels greater responsibility for wallet security irreversible transactions For many users, the benefits outweigh the risks — especially when betting is approached responsibly. Summing It Up Sports betting using crypto is no longer experimental. It’s an established alternative built around speed, privacy, and user control. No-KYC sportsbooks represent the clearest expression of this shift. And among them, Dexsport stands out as one of the most complete platforms for betting on sports with crypto — combining anonymity, live betting tools, and transparent settlement into a single ecosystem. As crypto adoption continues, sportsbooks designed around wallets — not paperwork — are likely to define where the market goes next.",More News,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-12-27 06:38:00

56436835,https://bitzo.com/2025/12/crypto-credit-lines-with-no-mandatory-monthly-payments-2026-review-of-top-crypto-loan-providers,1766817853,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/56436835.jpeg,Crypto Credit Lines with No Mandatory Monthly Payments: 2026 Review of Top Crypto Loan Providers,https://bitzo.com/2025/12/crypto-credit-lines-with-no-mandatory-monthly-payments-2026-review-of-top-crypto-loan-providers,"One of the biggest pain points in early crypto lending products was rigidity. Borrowers had to follow fixed repayment schedules, pay interest on funds they did not fully use, and manage monthly obligations that often made little sense in volatile markets. By 2026, this has changed. A growing number of platforms now offer crypto credit lines with no mandatory monthly payments, giving borrowers far more control over timing, cost, and risk. This review looks at how that shift is playing out across leading providers, with a focus on platforms that allow flexible repayment. Clapp leads this category, followed by Ledn, Compound, and Binance Loans—each taking a different approach to borrower freedom. Why Borrowers Prefer No Mandatory Monthly Payments Crypto-backed borrowing is often used as a liquidity buffer rather than a traditional loan. Investors may need funds temporarily, irregularly, or only during specific market conditions. Monthly repayment requirements can force unnecessary asset sales or poor timing decisions. Credit lines without mandatory payments solve this by allowing borrowers to repay when it suits their strategy. Instead of managing a schedule, borrowers manage risk and collateral health, which aligns better with how crypto markets actually behave. Clapp — Most Flexible Credit Line With Zero Carrying Cost Clapp is built entirely around the idea that liquidity should be optional, not expensive. Its revolving crypto credit line allows users to secure a borrowing limit and leave it unused at 0% APR. Interest only applies once funds are withdrawn. What sets Clapp apart in 2026 is how completely it removes repayment pressure. There are no monthly payments, no fixed terms, and no penalties for early or partial repayment. Borrowers repay whenever they choose, and once they do, the available credit automatically resets. Clapp also supports multi-collateral portfolios, allowing up to 19 assets—including BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, LINK, and stablecoins—to back a single credit line. This reduces volatility risk and makes the absence of repayment deadlines safer for both the borrower and the platform. For users who want liquidity on standby without ongoing cost or obligations, Clapp offers the most borrower-friendly structure in the market. Ledn — No Monthly Payments With a Conservative Model Ledn takes a more conservative approach to crypto-backed credit but still avoids mandatory monthly repayments. Borrowers typically repay interest periodically or at maturity, depending on the product structure, rather than following a strict monthly amortization schedule. Ledn focuses primarily on BTC-backed lending and emphasizes capital preservation and transparency. While it does not offer the same revolving, pay-as-you-use flexibility as Clapp, it appeals to borrowers who value simplicity and conservative risk management over maximum flexibility. Ledn works best for users who want fewer variables and are comfortable with a more traditional loan structure—just without monthly repayment pressure. Compound — No Payments, but Active Risk Management Required Compound represents the DeFi version of repayment flexibility. There are no mandatory payments at all—no monthly schedule, no maturity date. Borrowers can repay whenever they choose, or not at all, as long as their collateral remains above liquidation thresholds. That flexibility comes with responsibility. Because interest accrues continuously and collateral ratios fluctuate in real time, borrowers must actively monitor their positions. Sudden market movements can trigger liquidations without warning if collateral health is neglected. Compound suits experienced users who understand on-chain risk management and prefer non-custodial control. It offers freedom, but not guidance. Binance Loans — Flexible Repayment Within Defined Terms Binance Loans sit somewhere between traditional crypto loans and modern credit lines. While some products require repayment at maturity rather than monthly installments, terms are still defined upfront. Borrowers can often repay early without penalties, and there is no forced monthly payment cycle. However, interest usually applies to the full borrowed amount from day one, which makes Binance less cost-efficient for users who need liquidity only intermittently. Binance Loans are most suitable for users already active on the exchange who want convenient access to borrowing without strict monthly obligations, even if flexibility is not absolute. Crypto Credit Lines Without Mandatory Monthly Payments Platform Product Type Monthly Payments Required Interest Model Collateral Type Best For Clapp Revolving crypto credit line No Interest only on used funds; 0% APR on unused limit Multi-collateral (up to 19 assets) Borrowers seeking maximum flexibility and lowest carrying cost Ledn Crypto-backed loan No fixed monthly payments (interest or maturity-based) Interest on full loan amount Primarily BTC Conservative borrowers focused on simplicity Compound DeFi lending protocol No Variable, continuous interest On-chain collateral (WBTC, ETH, stablecoins) Advanced users comfortable with active risk management Binance Loans Exchange-based crypto loans No monthly payments (repayment at maturity) Interest on full borrowed amount Broad asset support Exchange users seeking convenient borrowing Final Thoughts In 2026, crypto credit lines without mandatory monthly payments are becoming the standard for borrowers who value flexibility. Among the platforms reviewed, Clapp offers the clearest and most cost-efficient version of this model, combining zero-cost standby liquidity, multi-collateral support, and complete repayment freedom. Ledn, Compound, and Binance Loans each serve distinct user profiles, from conservative BTC holders to DeFi-native borrowers. The right choice depends on how actively you manage risk and how often you expect to use borrowed funds. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

56437074,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/12/storytelling-in-crypto-pr-why-narratives-matter-more-than-announcements,1766817958,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/56437074.jpeg,Storytelling in Crypto PR: Why Narratives Matter More Than Announcements,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/12/storytelling-in-crypto-pr-why-narratives-matter-more-than-announcements,"Crypto teams often believe attention comes from activity. More announcements, more features, more updates. In practice, attention comes from clarity. And clarity comes from storytelling. In crypto PR, storytelling is not about slogans or dramatization. It is about explaining why a project exists, how it fits into the market, and why anyone outside the team should care. This gap between building and being understood is where most projects lose traction — and where effective PR makes a difference. Based on the experience of Outset PR working with Web3 companies, this article explains how storytelling functions in crypto PR when it actually works. Why storytelling matters in crypto PR Crypto media and communities see hundreds of launches every month. New chains, new tokens, new platforms. Most of them sound interchangeable because they are presented as isolated updates rather than parts of a larger narrative. Journalists do not cover features. They cover relevance. Communities do not rally around roadmaps. They rally around meaning. Outset PR treats every public update as part of a wider story. A feature is never the story on its own. The story is the market problem it responds to, and the timing of that response. When communication starts there, attention follows naturally. From product updates to narratives journalists understand Many crypto PR pitches fail because they confuse internal progress with external significance. A team knows why a release matters. The reader does not. Outset PR reframes product updates as reactions to real failures in the market. A governance upgrade becomes part of the broader conversation about why rushed decision-making has damaged trust in DeFi. An infrastructure release is positioned as a response to scaling mistakes made during previous market cycles. Nothing is exaggerated. The feature stays the same. What changes is the context. This is what makes a story usable for journalists and readable for non-technical audiences. Storytelling starts with positioning PR storytelling begins with positioning. Positioning defines the logic behind a project’s existence. Outset PR works with teams to articulate why the product was built, what the founders identified early, and which strategic choices shaped development. These elements form a narrative foundation that guides all communication. Once this foundation is established, it informs decisions about media outreach, founder commentary, and community messaging. Each public message reinforces the same underlying story and contributes to a coherent long-term narrative. One narrative across media and community communication Crypto PR reaches different audiences through different channels. Journalists and communities engage with information in distinct ways, but both respond to consistency. Outset PR maintains a single narrative while adjusting emphasis. Media communication highlights relevance to market trends and industry discussions. Community communication focuses on progress, direction, and participation. The narrative remains stable across both contexts. This structure preserves clarity and prevents fragmentation of the project’s identity. Timing and narrative alignment in crypto PR Storytelling gains strength when it aligns with active market conversations. Crypto narratives evolve in cycles driven by technology shifts, regulation, and user behavior. Outset PR monitors these cycles to identify moments of natural alignment between a project’s development and broader industry focus. Communication launched during these windows integrates smoothly into existing discussions and gains higher visibility. This approach supports relevance without altering the project’s core message. What storytelling achieves in crypto PR Storytelling creates continuity, recognition, and understanding. Journalists gain clear reference points for coverage. Communities gain a sense of direction and involvement. Investors gain insight into strategic thinking and long-term planning. Projects that communicate through narrative build durable presence in the market. Storytelling gives crypto PR the structure needed to sustain attention over time.

And, it did at least for the first week or so. Bitcoin skyrocketed to a new all-time high of over $126,000. However, it all went horribly wrong in the following few days, especially after the October 10 crash, when over $19 billion worth of liquidations hit overleveraged traders. Nothing was really the same after that calamity, which is still being cited as the beginning of the end. The cryptocurrency has plunged by over 30% since then and now struggles below $90,000, which has become an insurmountable resistance. Analysts are predominantly aligned in believing that the bear market has actually started, and the question now is when the BTC bottom will be. 364 Days From the Top? Obviously, every analyst has a different theory on this, including Doctor Profit, who said that BTC will drop to somewhere around $40,000 by Q3 2026. In this article, though, we will focus on Ali Martinez’s opinion, which, to be fair, is not all that different. He based his analysis on the cycle top and bottom theory. As previously reported, bitcoin has the tendency to reach a cycle top precisely 1,064 days after its previous bottom, which was the case between the January 2015 and December 2017 bull market, as well as between December 2018 and November 2021 rally. Interestingly, the early October 2025 ATH was also after 1,064 days . Consequently, Martinez assumed that the bear market had started on that history-making date and had set up the stage for the subsequent long-term correction. He noted that these periods last 364 days (or almost an entire year) and the potential bottom should be around October 2026. How Low Will BTC Go? Continuing with the same history lesson, Martinez asserted that BTC had plunged by 84% during the 2017-2018 bear market and by 77% during the 2021-2022 one. If we average that number to around 80%, the next market bottom should see the cryptocurrency dropping to around $37,500. While this sounds indeed scary at the moment, it’s worth noting that this projection is based on the popular 4-year cycle theory. However, many other analysts have claimed in the past several months that BTC has snapped out of it and it operates under different rules, given its institutional rise, ETF products, DATs, and government backing.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain dominant forms of collateral, many investors now hold significant positions in assets like SOL, BNB, LINK, and other high-liquidity altcoins. The challenge for lenders is clear: altcoins introduce higher volatility, and without careful risk controls, credit lines backed by them can become fragile. Clapp approaches this problem with a structured risk framework built around multi-collateral design, conservative credit mechanics, and regulatory oversight. Its altcoin-backed crypto credit line is designed to balance flexibility for borrowers with stability for the platform. Why Altcoin-Backed Credit Lines Are Riskier by Default Altcoins tend to be more volatile than BTC or ETH. Their prices can move sharply on lower liquidity, protocol news, or market sentiment. In a single-collateral lending model, this volatility directly increases liquidation risk. A sudden drawdown in one asset can quickly push a loan below safe collateral thresholds. For borrowers, this often means frequent margin calls or forced liquidations. For platforms, it creates systemic risk if many loans rely on correlated assets during market stress. This is where Clapp’s approach diverges from simpler altcoin-lending models. Multi-Collateral as the First Layer of Risk Control Clapp does not treat altcoins as isolated collateral positions. Instead, they are part of a multi-collateral pool that can include up to 19 different assets, ranging from BTC and ETH to SOL, BNB, LINK, and stablecoins. Rather than relying on a single volatile asset, Clapp evaluates the combined value and composition of the entire collateral portfolio. This reduces exposure to sharp moves in any one token and smooths overall risk. If an altcoin experiences a temporary drop, stronger or more stable assets in the pool help absorb the impact. This portfolio-based approach reflects how professional risk management works in traditional finance, where exposure is assessed at the portfolio level rather than asset by asset. Dynamic Collateral Management and Real-Time Adjustments Risk management at Clapp is dynamic, meaning borrowers can actively manage and rebalance their positions as markets move. If volatility increases in a specific altcoin, users can: Add more stable collateral Reduce exposure to the volatile asset Shift weight toward BTC, ETH, or stablecoins The credit line updates in real time based on the revised collateral mix. This flexibility allows borrowers to respond to market conditions before risk escalates to liquidation thresholds. Importantly, this dynamic structure works alongside Clapp’s credit-line model, where borrowers are not locked into fixed loan amounts or repayment schedules. Credit Line Structure as a Risk-Reduction Tool Clapp’s revolving crypto credit line also plays a role in controlling risk. Borrowers are not forced to draw the full amount of available credit. In fact, unused credit carries 0% APR, encouraging conservative usage. Interest accrues only on the portion of funds actually withdrawn, at a 2.9% annual rate. This reduces incentives to overborrow, which is a common source of liquidation risk in fixed-loan models. Because there is no repayment schedule, borrowers are also less likely to delay risk-reducing actions due to timing constraints. They can repay partially or fully at any moment to restore healthier collateral ratios. Regulatory Oversight and the European License Beyond technical risk controls, Clapp operates under a regulatory framework that adds an additional layer of discipline. Clapp holds a VASP license in the Czech Republic, aligning its operations with European regulatory standards for crypto service providers. This status requires compliance with AML and operational transparency obligations, as well as clear internal controls around asset handling. While regulation does not eliminate market risk, it does reduce counterparty and operational risk. Final Thoughts Altcoin-backed crypto credit lines require more than simple collateral ratios to be safe. They demand portfolio-level thinking, flexible management, and disciplined borrowing structures. Clapp’s approach reflects this reality. By combining multi-collateral design, dynamic rebalancing, pay-as-you-use credit lines, and operation under a Czech VASP license, Clapp demonstrates how altcoin risk can be managed without sacrificing borrower flexibility. For crypto holders looking to unlock liquidity from diversified portfolios, this risk-aware structure marks a meaningful evolution in crypto lending.

This comprehensive analysis examines MKR price predictions from 2026 through 2030, evaluating the protocol’s fundamental strengths within the expanding DeFi ecosystem. MakerDAO’s unique position as the pioneer of decentralized stablecoins provides crucial context for understanding MKR’s investment trajectory. MakerDAO Price Prediction: Analyzing MKR’s Market Position MakerDAO maintains its foundational role in decentralized finance through the Dai stablecoin ecosystem. The protocol’s governance token, MKR, serves multiple critical functions including system governance, risk management, and collateral backing. According to blockchain analytics firm Messari, MakerDAO consistently ranks among the top three DeFi protocols by total value locked, demonstrating sustained institutional and retail confidence. Furthermore, the protocol’s multi-collateral Dai system now supports over 30 different asset types, significantly expanding its utility and stability mechanisms. Recent developments in 2024 and early 2025 have substantially impacted MKR’s valuation framework. The successful implementation of Endgame Phase 1 introduced SubDAOs and enhanced governance efficiency. These technical upgrades, combined with growing real-world asset adoption, create new revenue streams for the protocol. Consequently, analysts from CoinMetrics and CryptoCompare note improved fundamentals that could influence MKR’s price trajectory through the latter half of the decade. Technical and Fundamental Analysis for 2026-2027 Projections Technical analysis reveals several key patterns for MKR’s medium-term outlook. Historical data from TradingView indicates that MKR has established stronger support levels following each major market cycle. The token’s correlation with broader cryptocurrency markets has decreased from 0.85 in 2021 to approximately 0.65 in 2025, suggesting growing independence from Bitcoin’s price movements. This decoupling trend, documented in a 2024 Journal of Digital Finance study, typically precedes more stable long-term growth patterns for established DeFi assets. Expert Perspectives on MKR’s Valuation Drivers Industry experts emphasize several critical factors for MKR’s valuation through 2027. Dr. Elena Rodriguez, blockchain economist at Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, identifies three primary drivers: “First, Dai’s adoption in traditional finance partnerships; second, governance participation rates among token holders; third, the protocol’s ability to maintain stability during market stress events.” These elements directly impact MKR’s burn mechanism and governance utility, creating fundamental value beyond speculative trading. The following table summarizes key metrics analysts monitor for MKR valuation: Metric Current Status (2025) Projected Trend Dai Supply 5.2 billion Increasing Governance Participation 42% of circulating supply Moderate growth Protocol Revenue $48M quarterly Accelerating RWA Collateral Percentage 38% Significant increase Long-Term Outlook: MKR Price Prediction 2028-2030 The 2028-2030 period presents both opportunities and challenges for MakerDAO’s native token. Regulatory developments will significantly influence DeFi adoption rates globally. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework implementation, scheduled for full enforcement by 2026, creates clearer compliance pathways for decentralized stablecoins. Consequently, Dai could experience accelerated adoption in regulated financial environments, potentially increasing demand for MKR tokens through enhanced governance requirements. Technological advancements also factor heavily into long-term projections. The anticipated completion of MakerDAO’s Endgame roadmap by 2027 should create a more modular and efficient protocol architecture. According to technical documentation reviewed by blockchain research firm Delphi Digital, these upgrades aim to improve scalability, reduce governance friction, and enhance ecosystem sustainability. Such improvements typically correlate with increased protocol usage and, by extension, greater utility for governance tokens like MKR. Comparative Analysis with Competing DeFi Protocols MakerDAO operates within a competitive landscape featuring protocols like Aave, Compound, and emerging decentralized stablecoin projects. Unlike purely lending-focused protocols, MakerDAO’s primary product—the Dai stablecoin—occupies a distinct market niche. Data from DeFi Llama indicates that decentralized stablecoins collectively represent approximately 8% of the total stablecoin market, with significant growth potential as trust in centralized alternatives fluctuates. This market expansion could disproportionately benefit early innovators like MakerDAO, provided they maintain technological and governance advantages. Several key differentiators position MKR uniquely: First-mover advantage in decentralized stablecoins Proven stability through multiple market cycles Growing real-world asset integration enhancing collateral diversity Established governance community with high participation rates Regulatory engagement through transparent operations Risk Factors and Market Considerations for MKR Investors Potential investors must carefully evaluate several risk factors alongside MKR’s promising fundamentals. Regulatory uncertainty remains a primary concern, particularly regarding how different jurisdictions will classify and govern DeFi governance tokens. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s ongoing classification debates could significantly impact MKR’s trading accessibility on major exchanges. Additionally, technological risks persist, including smart contract vulnerabilities and potential protocol upgrades that might not achieve intended outcomes. Market competition represents another crucial consideration. New decentralized stablecoin projects with innovative mechanisms continue entering the space, potentially challenging Dai’s market share. However, MakerDAO’s extensive track record and substantial ecosystem provide significant defensive advantages. The protocol’s decentralized nature and community-driven development have historically enabled adaptive responses to competitive pressures, as documented in a 2023 MIT Digital Currency Initiative case study. Conclusion MakerDAO’s MKR token presents a compelling case study in DeFi investment analysis through 2030. The protocol’s foundational role in decentralized finance, combined with ongoing technological development and expanding real-world integration, creates multiple pathways for value appreciation. While market volatility and regulatory developments will inevitably influence short-term price movements, MKR’s utility as a governance token within one of DeFi’s most established ecosystems provides fundamental support. Investors conducting thorough due diligence should consider both the protocol’s innovative potential and its proven resilience when evaluating MKR as a long-term DeFi investment. FAQs Q1: What primarily drives MKR’s value as a cryptocurrency? MKR’s value derives from its utility within the MakerDAO ecosystem, including governance rights, protocol fee mechanisms, and its role in maintaining the Dai stablecoin’s collateralization. The token’s price generally correlates with protocol usage, revenue generation, and overall DeFi adoption trends. Q2: How does MakerDAO generate revenue, and how does this benefit MKR holders? MakerDAO generates revenue primarily through stability fees charged on Dai loans and liquidations of undercollateralized positions. A portion of this revenue funds the protocol’s surplus buffer, while excess revenue triggers MKR token burns, potentially reducing supply and increasing scarcity over time. Q3: What are the biggest risks to MKR’s price growth through 2030? Significant risks include regulatory crackdowns on DeFi governance tokens, technological failures within the Maker protocol, increased competition from alternative stablecoin projects, and broader cryptocurrency market downturns that reduce overall DeFi activity and collateral values. Q4: How does MKR differ from other DeFi governance tokens like COMP or AAVE? Unlike lending protocol tokens, MKR specifically governs a decentralized stablecoin system with unique stability mechanisms. MKR holders manage critical risk parameters for collateral assets and the Dai monetary policy, creating different utility dynamics compared to tokens governing primarily lending markets. Q5: What metrics should investors monitor when evaluating MKR’s long-term potential? Key metrics include Dai supply growth, percentage of real-world asset collateral, governance participation rates, protocol revenue and surplus buffer levels, MKR token burn rates, and the overall health of the MakerDAO ecosystem as measured by developer activity and community engagement.

Yet the most important difference between lending platforms lies deeper—in how collateral is managed over time. Some platforms rely on static collateral models, while others like Clapp.finance operate with dynamic collateral in crypto loans . The distinction determines how risk is monitored, how quickly problems surface, and how much control borrowers retain when markets move. What Static Collateral Means In a static collateral model, collateral is assessed primarily at loan origination. The borrower deposits assets, receives a loan, and the position remains largely unchanged unless liquidation thresholds are reached. Risk monitoring exists, but it is reactive. Alerts tend to arrive late, and adjustments often require closing or refinancing the loan. Interest accrues on the full loan amount, and repayment structures are fixed or semi-fixed. Static models resemble traditional lending. They offer simplicity, but they assume relatively stable conditions. In crypto markets, that assumption rarely holds. The Limits of Static Collateral in Volatile Markets When prices move slowly, static collateral works. When volatility spikes, it becomes fragile. Because static models rely on predefined terms, borrowers often discover risk only when LTV is already high. By the time margin calls or liquidation warnings appear, the window to act may be narrow. Static collateral also discourages incremental adjustments. Adding collateral or reducing exposure mid-loan can be operationally cumbersome, increasing the chance of forced liquidation. What Dynamic Collateral Management Looks Like Dynamic collateral models treat risk as a continuous variable rather than a binary state. Collateral values, LTV, and borrowing capacity are recalculated in real time as market prices change. Borrowers can adjust exposure incrementally by adding collateral or repaying part of the balance without restructuring the loan. Interest typically accrues only on active borrowing, not on theoretical exposure. This aligns cost with real usage and encourages more conservative behavior. Dynamic models are better suited to markets where prices shift rapidly and unpredictably. How Clapp Applies Dynamic Collateral Control Clapp is a licensed European crypto loan provider that operates a credit-line model built on dynamic collateral management. Users deposit crypto and receive a borrowing limit rather than a fixed loan. LTV is calculated continuously based on the drawn balance and real-time collateral value. Unused credit does not increase risk and carries 0% APR. Rates adjust with LTV, reflecting current risk rather than assumptions made at origination. Borrowers receive early notifications as their position approaches liquidation thresholds, giving them time to act. Because repayments immediately restore available credit, exposure can be fine-tuned instead of reset. This makes risk management an ongoing process rather than a one-time decision. Dynamic vs Static: The Risk Control Difference The core difference between static and dynamic collateral is timing. Static models respond when risk is already high. Dynamic models surface risk as it develops. This difference often determines whether borrowers exit positions on their own terms or through forced liquidation. Dynamic collateral management does not remove risk, but it makes risk visible and manageable. It shifts control back to the borrower. Choosing the Right Model Static collateral may suit users who prefer fixed terms and minimal interaction, but it requires acceptance of higher liquidation risk during sudden market moves. Dynamic collateral models favor active oversight, transparency, and flexibility. They are better aligned with how crypto markets behave in practice. For borrowers using crypto loans as a liquidity tool rather than a leverage play, dynamic collateral offers a more resilient framework. Final Thoughts Risk control in crypto lending is not defined by interest rates or marketing claims. It is defined by how collateral is monitored and adjusted as markets change. The shift from static to dynamic collateral models reflects the maturation of crypto lending. Platforms that embrace continuous risk management give borrowers a clearer view of their exposure and more tools to stay in control when volatility returns.

Rather than relying on opinion, the post centers on excerpts from an official-looking publication that, according to SMQKE, records how Russian financial authorities evaluated blockchain solutions for cross-border settlements, with explicit references to Ripple and XRP. The material shared shifts the focus from market narratives to institutional research, inviting readers to examine what appears to be a formal assessment carried out by Russia’s central banking system. Research Into Cross-Border Settlement Systems SMQKE reports that the attached document outlines work conducted by the Bank of Russia, including activities in the first half of 2018 through its Novosibirsk innovative laboratory. The research reportedly investigated whether blockchain technology could enhance cross-border transfer mechanisms and whether the Ripple platform could serve as a viable foundation for such systems. According to the text highlighted in the images, the study examined how settlement participants could operate special accounts within national payment systems while also maintaining addresses on the Ripple network. The goal, as described, was to test whether transactions could be reflected efficiently in domestic systems after each transfer or at designated intervals, creating a bridge between traditional infrastructure and distributed ledger technology. Central Bank of Russia XRP Documented. https://t.co/dZ0agfKOV2 pic.twitter.com/wBQh6ZosNq — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) December 23, 2025 Conditions for Using XRP in Settlements SMQKE emphasizes that the document does not merely mention experimentation but goes further to outline conclusions and prerequisites. The research reportedly determined that the Ripple platform could be considered as a foundation for building a cross-border settlement system, provided certain organizational, legal, and technical matters were resolved. Within that framework, the document references the potential use of XRP for transfers or fiat equivalents issued by participating national banks. It also discusses mechanisms for reconciling balances between Ripple network accounts and domestic payment systems, the application of embedded cryptographic solutions, and the development of procedures for determining exchange rates when XRP is used in interstate settlements. In SMQKE’s reading, these details suggest that XRP was evaluated not as an abstract concept but as a practical instrument within a structured financial model. What the Documents Suggest About Institutional Interest The post frames these findings as evidence that central banking institutions have, at least at a research level, taken XRP seriously as part of future payment architecture. SMQKE presents the material as confirmation that discussions around blockchain adoption were already occurring within major monetary authorities years ago, well before current debates about digital assets and financial modernization intensified.

Community Reaction and Broader Implications Alongside SMQKE’s presentation, an X user identified as Tyler reacted by characterizing the connection between Russia and XRP as unexpected and strategic, suggesting that it underscores how global financial alignments continue to evolve and why tracking flows and diversification remains important. Overall, SMQKE’s post positions the shared document as a reminder that behind today’s headlines are years of formal studies and internal evaluations. If accurately represented, the material suggests that XRP has been a long-standing topic of discussion within influential financial bodies, thereby reinforcing its relevance in conversations about the future of cross-border payments.

Starting from January 1, Hoskinson’s fan base will be able to engage with him on Midnight Discord for weekly AMAs, YouTube for livestreams, and he also said he will focus on long-form writing that has been a decade in the making. The person behind Cardano and, in parts, Ethereum believes X “rewards outrage,” while the work that they are building, including Africa, Midnight 1.0, and Cardano governance, “rewards building.” The comments below his post were split. Some were quick to praise his move, agreeing that this is a decision many are “contemplating, given the direction of the platform.” Others were a bit more dismissive, saying that Hoskinson didn’t have to announce his departure as X is not an airport. ADA Price Impact? Hoskinson’s most important engagements on X have sometimes impacted the price of ADA, including on multiple occasions last year when he said he would work with the Trump administration in 2026 to establish clear crypto regulations. Or, when he hinted that Cardano might partner with Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Both of these led to immediate double-digit price pumps. The situation now seems rather different, though. He has taken sabbaticals from X in the past, which didn’t really affect ADA. Even if he doesn’t return this time, he would still be available on other platforms. Nevertheless, ADA has been dropping hard in the past several months. It’s down by over 5% weekly and 18% monthly, and sits well below the cycle peak of over $1, currently trading at $0.35.

This action, first reported by The Information, immediately sent ripples through the fintech and cryptocurrency sectors, highlighting the persistent regulatory hurdles facing blockchain-based payment firms. Significantly, the bank clarified its position was rooted in specific sanctions compliance, not opposition to stablecoin technology itself, framing the incident as a critical case study in global financial governance. JPMorgan Freezes Accounts: The Core Sanctions Allegation JPMorgan took the definitive step of severing banking services to BlindPay and Kontigo after identifying business activities linked to regions under U.S. sanctions, primarily Venezuela. Both startups, operating within Latin America’s burgeoning digital economy, accessed the bank’s crucial infrastructure through Checkbook, a digital payments firm. Consequently, this channel did not shield them from the stringent compliance reviews major banks must perform. The bank’s statement was unequivocal: the decision resulted from the firms’ connections to sanctioned jurisdictions, not from a philosophical stance against stablecoins. This distinction is vital for understanding the modern financial landscape, where compliance often dictates access. Furthermore, this event is not isolated. Major financial institutions globally operate under intense scrutiny from regulators like the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). They must meticulously monitor transactions to avoid severe penalties. For instance, in recent years, other banks have faced billion-dollar fines for sanctions violations. Therefore, JPMorgan’s proactive account freeze represents a standard, if impactful, risk mitigation procedure. The action protects the bank from potential legal and reputational damage, demonstrating the non-negotiable nature of sanctions enforcement in international banking. Navigating the Latin American Stablecoin Ecosystem The targeted startups, BlindPay and Kontigo, operate in a region where stablecoins have gained substantial traction. Latin American economies frequently grapple with high inflation and currency volatility. Stablecoins, digital assets pegged to stable reserves like the US dollar, offer residents a potential hedge and a more efficient medium for remittances and cross-border trade. Many analysts view them as a financial innovation tool for the region. However, their integration with the traditional banking system, often called the “on-ramp” and “off-ramp,” remains fraught with challenges. Access to banking partners like JPMorgan is essential for these startups. It allows users to convert local currency into stablecoins and vice versa. Without it, their operational capacity severely diminishes. This dependency creates a vulnerability, as seen in this case. The situation reveals a broader tension: innovative fintech firms pushing financial inclusion versus established banks bound by rigid, global compliance frameworks. This tension defines much of the current dialogue between the crypto industry and traditional finance. The Critical Role of Banking Correspondents and Third-Party Services BlindPay and Kontigo utilized Checkbook as their gateway to JPMorgan’s services. This is a common model where fintechs partner with licensed payment processors or specialized banks that can provide direct access to larger financial networks. This layered structure, however, does not absolve the end-client from compliance scrutiny. Banks like JPMorgan maintain ultimate responsibility for their clients’ activities, even those introduced by third parties. The due diligence process, known as Know Your Customer’s Customer (KYCC), is becoming increasingly stringent. This incident will likely prompt payment facilitators like Checkbook to enhance their own vetting processes for crypto-related clients. The Ripple Effect: Impacts on Startups and Market Sentiment The immediate impact on BlindPay and Kontigo is operational paralysis. A frozen bank account halts customer deposits and withdrawals, effectively freezing business activity. This can quickly erode user trust and trigger liquidity crises. For the wider Latin American crypto market, the event serves as a stark warning. It may cause other banks to reassess their exposure to crypto-native businesses, potentially leading to broader “de-risking” in the region. This could stifle innovation and limit consumer access to digital dollar alternatives. Conversely, the bank’s explicit statement distancing the action from anti-stablecoin sentiment could be seen as a nuanced positive. It acknowledges stablecoins as a legitimate, if regulated, financial product. The table below contrasts potential short-term and long-term impacts of this decision: Area of Impact Short-Term Consequence Potential Long-Term Effect Targeted Startups Operational shutdown, loss of user trust. Forced restructuring, seeking non-US banking partners, or closure. Latin American Crypto Sector Increased caution from investors and partners. Stronger focus on compliance infrastructure and local banking alliances. Global Bank Policy Reinforced strict sanctions screening for fintech clients. Clearer, but potentially more restrictive, onboarding frameworks for crypto firms. Market analysts note that such events accelerate the industry’s maturation. Startups are now compelled to build robust compliance programs from inception. They must demonstrate clear geofencing capabilities, transaction monitoring, and adherence to sanctions lists. This professionalization, while costly, may ultimately lead to more sustainable businesses and greater institutional acceptance. Conclusion The decision by JPMorgan to freeze the accounts of stablecoin startups BlindPay and Kontigo is a multifaceted event with clear origins in sanctions enforcement. It underscores an immutable reality for the cryptocurrency sector: innovation must coexist with rigorous compliance. For Latin America, a region where digital assets promise significant economic utility, the incident highlights the fragile bridge between new financial technologies and the established global banking system. The path forward requires crypto firms to prioritize transparency and regulatory dialogue, while banks may need to develop more nuanced risk frameworks. Ultimately, this case of JPMorgan freezing accounts is less about opposition to stablecoins and more about the unforgiving mechanics of international finance law in a digital age. FAQs Q1: Why did JPMorgan freeze the accounts of BlindPay and Kontigo? JPMorgan froze the accounts because the startups were involved in business activities connected to U.S.-sanctioned regions, primarily Venezuela. The bank stated the action was strictly for sanctions compliance, not due to opposition to stablecoins. Q2: What are stablecoins, and why are they popular in Latin America? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable asset like the US dollar. They are popular in Latin America as a hedge against local currency inflation and for cheaper, faster cross-border payments and remittances. Q3: How did these startups have accounts with JPMorgan? They accessed JPMorgan’s banking services indirectly through a third-party digital payments firm called Checkbook, which acted as an intermediary or facilitator. Q4: Does this mean banks are against all cryptocurrency companies? Not necessarily. JPMorgan’s statement clarified the action was sanctions-based. Many banks work with crypto firms that demonstrate strong compliance programs, but they remain highly cautious due to regulatory and reputational risks. Q5: What can other crypto startups learn from this incident? Startups must invest in robust legal and compliance teams, ensure their business models and customer bases avoid sanctioned jurisdictions, and be transparent with banking partners about their operations and risk controls.

The prevailing market trends are also responsible for fueling heated discussions in the circles of each type of cryptocurrency. Even in the case of Shiba Inu (SHIB), which can be termed as a popular memecoin in the market today, there’s a sense of indecision. Price performance happens to be a concern in this case, along with the fact that there are no major discussions on socials. Even then, there are individuals with market knowledge who are moving towards projects that have a greater level of stability in relation to a memecoin. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) finds itself in the midst of a new wave in view of greater stability. Shiba Inu Faces Market Challenges For the Shiba Inu cryptocurrency, one can assess that the present position of the cryptocurrency is in a difficult position. The market performance of the cryptocurrency is still in the negative zone. On analyzing the performance of the cryptocurrency, one can assess that a fall can be perceived at a rate of $0.0000066 rather than a rise. There are certain important factors that support the negative observation mentioned above. The engagement of the general public with regard to the SHIB cryptocurrency appears to be decreasing in the internet world, which reveals a lack of interest in the cryptocurrency. The entire market of the cryptocurrency is facing a downfall; such situations are being witnessed. Mutuum Finance: A Far Better Crypto Option Whereas others like SHIB are facing difficulties, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents an attractive and well-considered option. This is more than a new crypto option; it has already had its security audit and is almost ready to be launched. Those investors searching for the next big crypto are generally supportive of MUTM as it is actually making considerable progress and offers an attractive presale option. It has already raised in excess of $19.5 million from 18,580+ investors in its presale offering. It is currently in Phase 6, where each unit sells at $0.035. This represents an increase of 250% from its initial purchase price. Phase 6 is already 99% sold out. This is the final level where tokens will be priced at $0.035. Then comes the cost of $0.040 in phase 7 of the project. Further, the final launch cost is set for $0.06; hence, there is profit potential in the cost of launch. An added feature that makes an investment in the ecosystem attractive is the incorporation of two methods of lending. One of the methods utilizes communal pool of assets like ETH. The other method allows the custom compilation of contracts. It also has the most essential stablecoin in the pipeline. The stablecoin has been developed in such a way as to maintain the price of the coin stable at $1. An added feature that is attractive in the sense that it acts as a way of enticement of the investment in the project is the incorporation of a daily leaderboard. It rewards the top-buying individual of the day with a bonus of $500 in MUTM. However, the particular individual ought to have made some activity of trade on that particular day. The security of all the codes has also been reviewed by the most expert auditors of the business. A Moment for Strategic Action The market conditions give rise to the existence of a unique divergence. There exist crypto communities that remain undecided about their strategy such as SHIB. On the other hand, the well-defined use cases of others have been pulling in sensible investments. Mutuum Finance is one of the pioneers in this regard. It is providing the true product along with the evidence of its security and a fast presale. For individuals interested in the sound and best crypto to invest in, there exists the unique choice in the form of MUTM. The opportunity for investing in the prevailing price of MUTM is dwindling down quickly.

Key Takeaways: Bitmain is slashing prices across older and newer ASIC models to clear inventory amid weak mining economics. Discounted deals have pushed some S19 and S21 machines to as low as $3–$4 per terahash, with deliveries scheduled into 2026. The company is pairing hardware sales with hosting services to stimulate demand and move equipment. The discounts span both older models and newer-generation machines, signaling a broad effort to clear inventory as mining economics remain strained, according to a report by TheMinerMag . In late December, the world’s largest ASIC manufacturer began advertising bundled deals and factory discounts that would have stood out as distressed sales earlier in the cycle. Bitmain Offers S19 XP+ Hydro Miners at $4/TH in Discounted Bundle Deal One promotion dated Dec. 23 offered a package of four S19 XP+ Hydro units paired with an ANTRACK V2 container, implying an effective price of roughly $4 per terahash for the 19 J/TH machines. Shipments for that batch are scheduled to begin in January 2026, suggesting Bitmain is willing to lock in low pricing well ahead of delivery. The move followed a separate auction-style sale in November for the air-cooled S19k Pro, a 23 J/TH model. That sale opened with a starting bid of $5.5 per terahash and allowed buyers to submit their own pricing. Final transaction values were determined after the bidding period closed, with deliveries slated for December 2025. Discounting appears to extend well beyond limited promotions. Internal factory price lists shared with customers and reviewed by TheMinerMag show that as of Dec. 22, Bitmain was quoting prices as low as $3 per terahash for S19e XP Hydro and 3U S19 XP Hydro units, while S19 XP+ Hydro machines were listed around $4 per terahash. Bitcoin network hashrate every Christmas Eve: 2009: 9 MH/s 2010: 108 GH/s 2011: 8 TH/s 2012: 22 TH/s 2013: 9 PH/s 2014: 271 PH/s 2015: 709 PH/s 2016: 2.3 EH/s 2017: 14 EH/s 2018: 39 EH/s 2019: 99 EH/s 2020: 134 EH/s 2021: 177 EH/s 2022: 240 EH/s 2023: 521 EH/s 2024: 779 EH/s… pic.twitter.com/50R2cogtGZ — Javier Hermosa (@JavierHermosa21) December 24, 2025 Even newer hardware has not been spared. S21 Immersion miners were offered at approximately $7 per terahash, while S21+ Hydro machines were priced near $8 per terahash before the application of coupons. The pricing update emphasized availability heading into year-end, pointing to a coordinated effort to stimulate demand. Alongside hardware discounts, Bitmain has been pushing hosting services as part of a bundled sales strategy. Hosting rates shared with customers indicate power costs generally ranging from 5.5 to 7 cents per kilowatt-hour across jurisdictions including the United States, Kazakhstan, Brazil, Paraguay and Ethiopia, plus an additional management fee. The approach suggests Bitmain is leaning more heavily on integrated sales to move equipment. Record Hashrate, Low Hashprice Squeeze Bitcoin Miners The price cuts come as Bitcoin’s network hashrate hovers near record highs while the asset’s price has pulled back, keeping hashprice close to multi-year lows. That combination has squeezed margins for miners and dampened appetite for new machines, particularly less efficient models, while intensifying competition among manufacturers and secondary-market sellers. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s network hashrate fell 4% in the month through Dec. 15, a development that could set the stage for stronger price performance in the months ahead, according to analysts at VanEck. “When hash rate compression persists over longer periods, positive forward returns tend to occur more often and with greater magnitude,” the analysts wrote.

In a recent post accompanied by a video, the analyst invites readers to reconsider the intent behind XRP’s long-standing escrow structure , arguing that its design may reveal an institutional strategy rather than a retail-focused one. This #XRP Theory Explains Everything!! pic.twitter.com/PdrR4m9JXd — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) December 23, 2025 Escrow as Pre-Allocated Institutional Liquidity The core of Ripple Bull Winkle’s argument is that the tens of billions of XRP locked in escrow were never meant to be gradually released for open market sales to everyday investors. Instead, he suggests that this reserve could represent pre-allocated liquidity intended for banks and large financial institutions. In his view, this interpretation is supported by past public comments from Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, who has indicated that escrowed XRP could, in principle, be directed to institutions if needed. By viewing the escrow as a strategic pool of liquidity, the analyst implies that XRP’s distribution model is less about organic retail circulation and more about readiness for large-scale financial deployment. This would mean that the asset’s supply has been structured with institutional demand in mind from the beginning, positioning it for use in scenarios where immediate and deep liquidity is required. Not a Rival to Bitcoin, but a Different Tool Ripple Bull Winkle further emphasizes that XRP should not be viewed as a competitor to Bitcoin. According to his analysis, Bitcoin has increasingly taken on the role of a store of value within the digital asset space, while XRP is being shaped for a different function altogether. He presents XRP as a candidate for settlement utility, aimed at addressing inefficiencies in the existing financial system rather than serving as a long-term value reserve. In this framework, XRP’s relevance would emerge most clearly during periods of systemic stress. The analyst argues that when traditional markets face disruptions, such as liquidity freezes or failures in established settlement mechanisms, institutions will require infrastructure that is already operational. Assets designed for utility, he suggests, tend to become critical at the moment of crisis rather than during speculative upswings. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Positioning Before the Shift Another element of the theory is timing. Ripple Bull Winkle contends that by the time the general public recognizes such a shift toward utility-driven adoption , the strategic positioning by institutions may already be complete. This view reinforces the idea that XRP’s design is forward-looking, anticipating a future environment where functional settlement assets are prioritized. Overall, the message from Ripple Bull Winkle centers on utility, structure, and long-term design. By portraying XRP’s escrow as a strategic reserve for institutional liquidity and aligning its role with settlement rather than speculation, the analyst presents a narrative in which XRP’s true function may only become evident when the financial system itself is put to the test.
