This has raised concerns among investors of WazirX who worry about its future. During a recent interview he had with TheStreet Roundtable host Mehab Qureshi, Shetty revealed that the long-running ownership dispute between WazirX and Binance has moved into litigation. “End of the day, I think it’s now gone into a stage of litigation,” he reportedly claimed. Ownership dispute between WazirX and Binance During the conversation, Shetty reiterated that WazirX was sold around late 2019-early 2020, following a public announcement at the time. However, what followed were conflicting claims, which saw both sides publicly disputing ownership of the platform. Binance denied holding any stake in WazirX. However, the Indian exchange claimed to have all the legal documents proving otherwise, which is how the ownership dispute began. As things stand, Shetty claims the dispute is at a “he said, she said” stage, which makes the outcome of the litigation much more important. When Shetty was asked whether Binance reached out to WazirX following the hack that shook the platform in July 2024, Shetty declined to comment, claiming the matter is under sub-judice. This is the latest development regarding the case, whose origins can be traced to the year 2019, after the crypto company announced that Binance had acquired it. What did Shetty say abou t cu stody dispute with Liminal? During his talk with TheStreet Roundtable host Mehab Qureshi, Shetty also addressed its dispute with Liminal, a digital asset custody and wallet infrastructure platform designed to help institutions, crypto exchanges, and digital asset businesses securely manage and store cryptocurrencies and tokenized assets. After the initial shock of the July 2024 hack that rocked WazirX by targeting its multi-signature wallet and resulting in a loss of over $230 million, the exchange blamed Liminal, claiming it was linked to Liminal’s multi-signature wallet infrastructure. It also pledged to migrate all remaining assets to a new multi-signature wallet, promising full transparency by publishing a list of all new wallets post-migration. Things got interesting when Liminal issued a counter-statement on October 22, 2024, denying responsibility for the breach. It claimed that 75 days after the hack, WazirX still held more than $175 million in assets on its platform, with roughly $50 million still under WazirX’s control via Liminal’s infrastructure. While in a conversation with TheStreet Roundtable host Mehab Qureshi, Shetty confirmed that the exchange had indeed been using Liminal’s software for custody infrastructure, but WazirX itself was always the primary point of contact for users. Shetty claims the exchange used Liminal’s technology for multi-key security with address whitelisting, ensuring that transactions could only be approved for preapproved wallets. “This was done so that even if all the devices of our team members got compromised, there’s a third party that would do the final check before authorizing a transaction,” he said. WazirX has claimed the cyberattack occurred through an external website used for fund management, not its own servers or hot wallets. “The cyber attack was not on the infrastructure, like the service of WazirX,” Shetty said . “It was a website that we were using for managing these funds, and through that website, the cyber attack happened”. According to him, the exchange had limited visibility into what happened “behind the scenes of a different website” and is awaiting further details from Liminal. “We only know our part. We have three laptops that were interacting with our website. Now we don’t know anything beyond that,” Shetty stated. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

In a detailed thread on X, Gaevoy said Wintermute disagrees with the proposal “as it stands,” while arguing that it asks tokenholders to commit to a major course of action without sufficient clarity on structure, governance, or outcomes. He disclosed that Wintermute has been an investor in AAVE since 2022 and participates actively in governance, but neither he nor the firm has any equity exposure to Aave Labs. Wintermute Slams Proposal According to the exec, the main issue is value accrual and a widening expectation mismatch between Aave Labs and a significant portion of AAVE tokenholders over who should capture value and how key external functions, particularly business development, should operate. He said those unresolved tensions make the current proposal premature and potentially harmful. Gaevoy also criticized the tone and politics surrounding the vote. While acknowledging that Aave founder Stani Kulechov’s communications “have been far from perfect,” he said the backlash against Aave Labs has gone too far and has negatively impacted the token’s price. Both sides, he added, are accusing each other of “hostile takeovers,” a claim he said has some validity depending on perspective. Gaevoy also said that reversing or softening earlier decisions, such as fee-related changes, could have helped reset the situation. But instead, the dispute escalated. He framed the vote as a “temperature check” rather than a decisive endpoint, saying the real priority should be de-escalation and serious work on long-term solutions for token value capture. While urging Aave Labs to engage constructively after the vote, Gaevoy wrote, “Whether it succeeds or fails doesn’t really matter.” The comments come as the token alignment proposal appears unlikely to pass. Snapshot data shows that a majority of AAVE DAO voters are opposed or abstaining, with roughly 55% voting against the proposal, about 41% abstaining, and 3.5% voting in favor. Voting is set for December 26. Critics have argued that Aave Labs rushed the governance process and pushed the proposal to a vote while discussions were still ongoing. The broader dispute traces back to a conflict over swap fee diversion, worth millions of dollars, that would have benefited the company rather than the DAO treasury. The alignment proposal itself focuses on tokenholders seeking control over Aave’s brand assets, including domains, social media accounts, and naming rights. The end goal is to ensure that any entity holding those assets remains accountable to the DAO. 2026 Roadmap Prior to the governance tensions, the platform laid out an ambitious roadmap for 2026 that aims to scale the protocol well beyond its current footprint. Kulechov unveiled the plan, which centers on three pillars: Aave V4, Horizon, and the Aave App. Aave V4 is expected to redesign the lending protocol to reduce liquidity fragmentation and support much larger capital flows. Horizon focuses on institutional users, allowing firms to borrow against tokenized real-world assets such as US Treasuries while meeting compliance needs. Meanwhile, the Aave App is positioned as a consumer-facing product aimed at onboarding millions of new users as Aave targets broader adoption.

Many investors are no longer chasing short-term moves. Instead, they are asking a more important question. Which cryptocurrencies still have room to grow before the next cycle matures? This is often when familiar names are re-evaluated and newer projects begin to stand out. Some are already showing early strength, even while prices remain low. That is why conversations around the best crypto to buy now are starting to include both established leaders and one new altcoin that has already climbed 250% while staying under $0.1. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum remains the backbone of much of the cryptocurrency market. Its ecosystem supports DeFi, NFTs, and a wide range of applications. With a massive market cap, ETH is often seen as a core holding rather than a high-growth play. Early investors benefited from strong moves when Ethereum was still building its foundation. Today, Ethereum faces a different challenge. Price action has repeatedly slowed near the $3,000 level. Many market commentators see this area as a major resistance zone. Breaking and holding above it has proven difficult without broad market momentum. This does not mean Ethereum lacks value. It means its growth profile has changed. At its current size, even strong adoption often translates into more gradual price movement. For investors looking for the next big cryptocurrency with higher upside potential, ETH’s role is increasingly about stability rather than acceleration. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu tells a different story. SHIB was one of the most talked-about crypto coins during its early surge. Early holders saw dramatic gains as attention poured in and price moved rapidly from near-zero levels. Now, SHIB faces its own resistance. Price action has struggled around the $0.00001 level. Market commentators often point out that SHIB’s large circulating supply makes sustained upward movement more difficult without renewed interest on a massive scale. While Shiba Inu still has a loyal community, its growth relies heavily on sentiment rather than utility. For many investors, that creates uncertainty when thinking about long-term positioning. This is why some are starting to shift focus toward projects with clearer use cases. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new DeFi crypto focused on decentralized lending and borrowing. Unlike meme-driven projects, its value proposition is tied directly to utility. Users will be able to supply assets, earn yield, and borrow against collateral in a system designed to adjust rates based on real usage. The presale began in early 2025 and has progressed steadily. The current token price is $0.035, and the project has already raised $19.45M. Participation has grown to 18,650 holders, with 825M tokens sold so far. Out of a fixed 4B total supply, 45.5% is allocated to the presale, equal to roughly 1.82B tokens. Phase 6 is now over 99% allocated, which means supply at the current price is nearly exhausted. Since Phase 1, the token has already climbed 250%, yet it remains well under $0.1. For those tracking crypto prices today and asking which crypto to buy now for long-term growth, this combination of low price and strong traction is drawing attention. MUTM vs SHIB Analysts often compare opportunities using practical examples. Consider a $500 investment. A $500 position in SHIB today depends largely on renewed hype to deliver strong returns. Given its large supply and established valuation, even optimistic scenarios tend to point toward more modest growth unless market conditions shift dramatically. A $500 position in MUTM at $0.035 offers a different profile. The official launch price is set at $0.06, which already represents a clear step up from current levels. Some analysts believe that if adoption develops as expected, MUTM could see 200% to 300% growth after launch. In more bullish scenarios tied to usage and exchange visibility, projections show even higher outcomes over time. This is not about guarantees. It is about structure. SHIB relies on sentiment. MUTM relies on a working protocol and demand tied to usage. V1 Launch and Security as Key Differentiators One reason analysts view Mutuum Finance as a stronger long-term contender is its development roadmap. According to official statements shared on X, V1 of the lending and borrowing protocol is planned for the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. Core features include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an automated liquidator bot. Initial supported assets will be ETH and USDT. Security has also been addressed early. Mutuum Finance has completed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 token scan score. An independent audit with Halborn Security is currently underway, reviewing finalized contracts. A $50k bug bounty has been launched to identify code vulnerabilities. As 2026 approaches, the question of what is the best cryptocurrency to invest in depends on goals. Ethereum offers scale and stability. Shiba Inu offers community and familiarity. Mutuum Finance offers early-stage exposure with a focus on real utility. For investors looking at the potential best crypto to buy now with an eye on growth rather than hype, this new altcoin under $0.1 is increasingly part of the conversation. With Phase 6 nearly complete and V1 on the horizon, Mutuum Finance is entering a stage where early traction and future potential begin to align.

56419499,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=884663,1766786403,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56419499.jpeg,"Investors are using funds, bars, coins, and miners to get exposure to silver",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/all-the-ways-silver-is-bought-and-sold/,"Silver broke $79 an ounce on Friday for the first time ever, capping off a run that’s left gold in the dust and dragged every other precious metal into the rally. Year-to-date, silver has surged more than 150% , way ahead of gold’s 70% rise. The rally has been tied to a mix of tight supplies, industrial buying, retail hoarding, and the U.S. under Donald Trump, labeling it a “critical mineral” in 2025. Buyers in solar, investment firms, and regular retail traders have all jumped in too, so this metal that would’ve gone to factories has instead ended up locked in vaults and ETFs. The largest volume of physical silver changes hands in London, where banks and brokers connect large institutional clients to the market. The trades happen over the counter, between two parties, not on an exchange. But this isn’t retail territory, folks, so you need a relationship with a major player to get in. HSBC and JPMorgan are two of the key banks storing the metal. As of late press time, these guys hold about 27,187 tons of silver in vaults across the city. There’s also the futures market, which handles massive volumes without anyone physically touching the metal. Two key hubs are the Shanghai Futures Exchange and COMEX in New York, run by CME Group, both allowing buyers and sellers to agree on a price today for silver that’s technically due later. But most people don’t wait, so the contracts are swapped out for newer ones, letting traders speculate without needing to store metal. Another perk is that the buyers don’t pay the full price up front. They only put up a margin, a small portion of the total value. Investors also use funds, bars, coins, and miners to get exposure to silver For retail investors (a.k.a. ‘dumb money’), silver ETFs have become the easiest way to get exposure, since, of course, they’re traded on platforms like NYSE and LSE, and sold on Robinhood (retailers’ favorite spot). Naturally, the biggest ETF is the iShares Silver Trust, managed by BlackRock, which holds around 529 million ounces, about $39 billion worth at current prices, according to data from the world’s largest asset manager itself. If enough buyers pile in and push the iShares silver ETF price above the real value of the metal, the fund adds more silver to its stash and issues new shares, because the goal here is to keep prices aligned. Some retailers still sell silver bars and coins to individual buyers, but it’s slower, and usually more expensive, though you’d be holding actual metal, so there is that. Some investors go another route too, like buying shares in mining companies whose stocks are easy to trade and tend to rise or fall with silver prices. But there’s more risk here; company debt, poor leadership, or bad earnings reports can crush a stock even if the metal is rallying. The surge in prices is also tied to supply hitting a wall. Most of the world’s major silver deposits have been exhausted, and new production isn’t keeping up. At the same time, solar manufacturers are buying more than ever. Retail traders are also stockpiling, choking the pipeline that would normally feed industrial demand. Not everyone’s bullish. Some traders argue that the silver market is too small and too volatile. Rachel Kwon, head of commodities at Luma Capital, warned , “This market can double or crash in weeks. There’s no in-between.” Still, others believe there’s more room to run. Some bulls say silver would need to jump above $200 an ounce to beat its 1980 inflation-adjusted high. While silver dominated headlines, gold also closed higher, hitting a record of $4,549.71 before settling at $4,552.70 for February futures. Platinum surged 9.8% to $2,437.72, reaching a peak of $2,454.12, and palladium spiked 14% to $1,927.81, its best level in over three years. All major precious metals logged weekly gains, with platinum posting its strongest performance on record. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

The company now tracks “European Commission fines” as a standard expense. The total reached $10.5 billion by September 30. This shows how penalties from the EU have become routine for the largest U.S. tech firms operating in Europe. In 2024, public technology companies based in Europe paid €3.2 billion in income tax. During the same year, regulators collected €3.8 billion in fines from U.S. technology firms. That means penalties alone exceeded the entire tax contribution of the listed European tech companies. Officials inside the bloc privately acknowledge that if SAP relocated operations to the United States, nearly half of that tax base would disappear, leaving fines as a growing revenue stream for the EU. EU regulators stack fines on Google across ads, Android, and AI The European Commission first fined Google €2.95 billion for adtech abuses tied to self-preferencing and conflicts inside its advertising supply chain. Regulators ordered the company to stop favoring its own ad services and restructure how it handles auctions and placement tools across Europe. Earlier rulings targeted mobile dominance. The Commission issued a €4.34 billion fine over illegal Android practices that forced device makers to pre-install Google Search and Chrome. Officials said those deals locked out rivals before users ever turned on their phones. Enforcement did not stop there. In December 2025, regulators opened a fresh investigation into whether Google uses publisher content and YouTube material to train its AI Overviews without fair payment. The probe focuses on whether that conduct harms competitors while boosting Google’s AI products inside the EU. EU laws pull Washington into a widening political clash Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has accused Brussels of targeting U.S. firms while allowing European companies to operate freely in America. His administration has warned of retaliation if enforcement continues. The U.S. State Department said this week it would deny visas to a former European commissioner and four others, stating they “have advanced censorship crackdowns by foreign states, in each case targeting American speakers and American companies.” Tensions escalated after the launch of the Digital Services Act, which apparently governs content moderation on social platforms, per the Commission’s notice . Shortly after, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative accused the EU and several member states of pushing “discriminatory and harassing lawsuits, taxes, fines and directives” against U.S. service providers while firms like Accenture, DHL, Siemens, and Spotify operate without similar barriers in the United States. Elon Musk’s platform X received the first fine under the DSA on December 5, totaling €120 million, or about $140 million, for design practices tied to the blue check system and allegedly blocking researcher access to public data, according to the EU. Alongside the DSA, the Digital Markets Act now governs competition. Seven gatekeepers fall under its scope: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Microsoft, Meta, and Booking.com. The DSA law strictly bans any forced use of pre-installed services, and it also requires an open App store choice from Apple, along with mandates on messaging interoperability. Apple had to pay €500 million in April for blocking alternative payments, while Meta paid €200 million for data use violations tied to Facebook and Instagram. European Commission president Urusula von der Lyn warned that repeat breaches from these companies will lead to penalties reaching 20% of global turnover.

Price remains capped below the $90,000 level, with repeated recovery attempts failing to gain traction. As volatility compresses and participation thins, an increasing number of analysts are warning that the market may face further downside before stability can return. For now, conviction on both sides remains limited, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to renewed selling pressure. On-chain data underscores this fragile backdrop. A recent report by Axel Adler examines daily capital inflows and outflows across the Bitcoin network, using a seven-day moving average of net capital flow to assess market health. This metric captures the balance between realized profits, which represent capital entering the network, and realized losses, which reflect capital being destroyed through loss-making sales. When the net flow turns negative, it signals that participants are selling at a loss more aggressively than they are taking profits. Currently, the seven-day average stands at approximately negative $160 million, meaning the market has been losing an average of $160 million in capital per day over the past week. The period between December 17 and 24 was marked by sharp volatility , with large outflows interspersed with brief positive days. Although December 25 saw another net inflow, it was not enough to offset prior losses. Elevated Coin Activity Signals Distribution Under the Surface On-chain data highlighted by Adler shows that Bitcoin remains unusually active despite weak market conditions. The Bitcoin “% Supply Active (Last 180 Days)” metric tracks the share of total BTC supply that has moved at least once over the past six months. Currently, that figure stands at 31.79%, slightly above its 30-day average of 31.43% and firmly in the 80th percentile compared with historical data. Activity has also risen sharply on a year-over-year basis, up 14.4%, indicating that coins are changing hands far more frequently than they were a year ago. At face value, elevated activity can sometimes signal renewed interest or accumulation. In the current context, however, it carries a more cautionary implication. High supply activity is occurring alongside a negative net capital flow regime, meaning that much of this movement reflects loss-making sales rather than profitable distribution. Coins are not simply rotating between long-term holders; they are being sold under pressure. This combination challenges the idea that the market is simply apathetic. Instead, it points to active distribution, with holders choosing to exit positions despite unfavorable prices. The distinction is important: apathy implies indecision, while distribution suggests stress. For this metric to turn constructive, elevated activity would need to persist while net capital flows recover toward zero or positive territory. Only then would increased coin movement begin to reflect accumulation rather than capitulation. Bitcoin Stabilizes As Key Trend Loses Momentum Bitcoin is trading around the $88,700 level on the 3-day chart, attempting to stabilize after a sharp correction from the $120,000–$125,000 highs set earlier in the year. While the broader uptrend that began in 2024 remains technically intact, the current structure reflects a clear loss of momentum and a transition into a corrective phase. Price action has shifted from strong impulsive moves to choppy consolidation, highlighting growing uncertainty among market participants. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin is now trading below its faster-moving average, which has rolled over and begun acting as dynamic resistance. The loss of this level marked a decisive change in market character, confirming that rallies are being sold rather than extended. At the same time, price is hovering just above the rising longer-term moving average, which continues to provide structural support and defines the boundary between a healthy correction and a deeper trend reversal. Volume dynamics reinforce the cautious outlook. The most aggressive volume expansion occurred during the sell-off from above $110,000, while the recent rebound toward $88,000 has unfolded on relatively muted participation. This suggests that selling pressure has eased, but buyers have not returned with conviction. Structurally, the $86,000–$90,000 range is critical. Holding above this zone preserves the broader bullish framework. However, a failure to reclaim the $95,000–$100,000 region would keep Bitcoin vulnerable to renewed downside pressure in the weeks ahead.

We asked the new version, GPT 5.2, to do price forecast for XRP, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu, and it delivered a quite interesting AI price outlook. Below are ChatGPT’s dual-scenario predictions outlining monumental potential gains and the downside hazards for each asset throughout December and going into 2026. Ripple (XRP): ChatGPT Predicts a Potential Rally To $4.20 If adoption for XRP declines and macro liquidity tightens, keeping XRP stuck below major resistance, ChatGPT AI predicts a total collapse for XRP to $1.20. That kind of drop would be completely out of character for XRP this year. After Ripple scored a major legal win against the SEC, XRP went on to hit a new all-time high around $3.65 in July. Most analysts think that momentum is not done yet. Even ChatGPT-based models are pointing to a possible move back into the $3.50 to $4.20 range as we head toward 2026. Between the RLUSD stablecoin launch, ongoing integrations, and growing adoption especially across Asia and Japan, plus steady ETF inflows, the setup is there. If the bull market keeps running, XRP breaking into fresh all-time highs in 2026 is very much on the table. Source: TradingView To fully reverse its downtrend, XRP needs to climb above the $2.2 level. This would break the token’s bearish price structure. This could set the stage for a strong recovery to $3 at least. A New Memecoins Cycle Could Be Led By Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Google Trends data shows that interest in memecoins has dropped to a five-year low. That loss of attention is showing up in the price too, with the memecoin sector down roughly 60% this year overall. For the Dogecoin bull case, ChatGPT sees momentum coming back in a big way, with DOGE potentially pushing into the $0.30 to $0.35 range heading into 2026. That outlook is built on the idea of a fresh memecoin cycle combined with a broader risk-on shift across the market. That is also why Bitcoin matters so much here. When BTC breaks out, capital usually rotates into memecoins, and as the leaders of the pack, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu tend to feel that move almost right away. The same story applies to Shiba Inu. It launched back in 2020 as a Dogecoin challenger and has since grown into a heavyweight, with a market cap sitting around $4.83 billion. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB also has a major network upgrade planned for 2026. The upgrade is expected to add a privacy layer, which could end up being the key catalyst that helps the token regain momentum when interest in memecoins picks back up. Shiba Inu is having a hard time finding any real momentum heading into Christmas, and the mood around it feels pretty undecided. SHIB is down roughly 1.7% over the last 24 hours. It has been stuck chopping in a tight range between $0.00000697 and $0.00000717. That kind of sideways action usually signals a sleepy market, and right now price is sitting closer to the bottom of that range. For this bounce to actually matter, SHIB needs to push above $0.00000800 and stay there. Maxi Doge Is Positioning For The Next Meme Rotation While ChatGPT is laying out big upside and downside scenarios for XRP, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu. Some traders are looking past the majors and focusing on where early momentum is quietly building. That is where Maxi Doge keeps popping up. Maxi Doge is leaning fully into the high-risk, high-reward side of the next memecoin cycle. When attention is low and sentiment is washed out. That is usually when early meme winners start getting accumulated before the crowd shows up. Right now, memecoin interest is near multi-year lows, which historically has been the exact environment where explosive rotations begin. The project has already raised over $4.28M, even while the broader memecoin sector looks completely dead. That kind of traction in a slow market suggests conviction, not hype chasing. On top of that, Maxi Doge is offering staking rewards up to 72% APY. This give holders a strong reason to lock in early and wait instead of flipping for short-term moves. If ChatGPT is right and 2026 brings renewed risk appetite and a fresh memecoin cycle. The biggest gains usually do not come from the old names everyone already owns. They come from the aggressive new plays that were built quietly during boredom phases. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu wait for momentum to return, Maxi Doge is already setting its base. When the rotation hits, that difference tends to matter fast. Maxi Doge is available through its presale using ETH, USDT, BNB, or a credit card directly on the official website .

A new hope is building that it will be the bullish year the market has been waiting for. XRP, Solana, and Cardano are all sitting on clean pullbacks and have been consolidating within steady price ranges for some time. Their next move higher may be approaching for the following reasons. Ripple (XRP): The OG Crypto That Could Still Be the Best Crypto Pick XRP ETFs have been pulling in serious money even while the price action looks completely dead. As of December 23, spot XRP ETFs logged about $1.13B in net inflows, with steady buying pressure holding up for the past 33 days. That performance actually puts them ahead of both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which have struggled to keep momentum during the same choppy market conditions. When you stack that ETF demand on top of ongoing ecosystem upgrades, major milestones, and a technically solid chart, 2026 is starting to look like it could be a really interesting year for XRP. Source: TradingView To fully reverse its downtrend, XRP needs to climb above the $2.2 level. This would break the token’s bearish price structure. This could set the stage for a strong recovery to $3 at least. Solana (SOL): The Coin of the Cycle Could Run It Back in 2026 Solana had an insane run starting in December 2024, topping out near $294 in January. Since then, it has been cut down hard and is now more than 50% off that peak. That kind of move is not new for SOL. Historically, it tends to overcorrect on the way down and then massively outperform once risk appetite comes back. Just look at the post-FTX collapse. SOL went from around $250 all the way down to about $8. A lot of people wrote it off for good, but it ended up ripping more than 30× after that. Source: TradingView As long as Solana stays above $120, the bullish setup is still intact. The big thing missing right now is volume. Buying pressure is pretty light, which shows bulls are hesitant and not fully stepping in yet. Without a real volume spike, any move above resistance risks turning into just another fake breakout. What would actually flip the script is a clean break above $144 with strong volume behind it. That kind of move would act like a trigger and could kick off the next leg higher. Cardano (ADA): $1 Back in Play After a Brutal Correction Cardano has taken a pretty hard hit lately, but it might be setting up for a bounce. Price is now drifting back toward an area where buyers have stepped in aggressively before, which could act as a base for a rebound. For ADA to really flip bullish, it needs to push above $0.36 and stay there. If that happens, the next hurdle is $0.38, a level it has already been rejected from twice in the past week. If ADA cannot break through, a dip back toward the $0.30 area is still on the table. The RSI is sitting around 40 and is not oversold yet, which means there is still room for downside in the short term. That said, as long as ADA holds above the previous low near $0.27, the bigger bullish setup stays intact going into the new year. Bitcoin Hyper Could Be the Real Christmas Eve Sleeper While most traders are checked out for the holidays and majors like XRP, SOL, and ADA grind through slow consolidations, Bitcoin Hyper is quietly doing the opposite and that is usually how early winners start. Bitcoin Hyper is built around one clear idea: giving Bitcoin real speed and utility without sacrificing security. It runs as a Bitcoin Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine. This means fast transactions, low fees, and full settlement back to Bitcoin. In a market where people are tired of bloated Layer 1 narratives, that combo is starting to stand out. The numbers back it up. Bitcoin Hyper has already raised over $29M, even with sentiment still shaky and volumes thin across the market. That kind of capital does not show up by accident, especially during the holidays when most investors are sitting on their hands. On top of that, staking rewards are sitting around 39% APY , which gives holders a reason to stay locked in rather than flip for short term noise. That is exactly how supply pressure quietly builds before bigger moves. When the market finally wakes up in the new year and risk appetite rotates back in, the projects that were accumulated during boring, low-volume phases tend to move first. While everyone waits for XRP to break $2.20, SOL to reclaim $144, or ADA to flip $0.36, Bitcoin Hyper is already positioning itself ahead of that rotation. Sometimes the best Christmas opportunity is the one no one is paying attention to yet.

Founders from both chains are reportedly teaming up to launch a new bridge that connects their ecosystems, a move that could redirect major trading volume toward Solana. For years, Solana and Cardano have battled for dominance as “Ethereum killers,” each taking a different approach. Solana is known for its blazing speed and low fees, while Cardano has focused on security and a careful, research-driven development process. Now, instead of competing for attention, the two may be aligning, and that shift toward collaboration could reshape the entire Layer 1 landscape. Time to get cooking https://t.co/jqMPw7R4Gl pic.twitter.com/jsjw4Tinfr — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 23, 2025 In a series of X posts, both Charles Hoskinson (Cardano’s founder) and Anatoly Yakovenko (Solana) agreed to start working on a bridge. This is a sign that the crypto space is maturing. Founders are recognizing that the next era of growth will come from building alliances through interoperability. This bridge could tap into the strengths of each network, allowing $SOL holders and users to take advantage of its privacy and security features. Meanwhile, Cardano’s users would benefit from getting access to a thriving DeFi market. Solana Price Prediction: SOL Needs to Move Above $125 to Reverse Its Downtrend Solana has broken below its long-held support at $127 and is now fighting to stay above $120, with trading activity and transaction volumes declining steadily over recent months. This bearish breakdown leaves SOL vulnerable to a deeper correction toward the $100 mark, a sharp contrast to just a few months ago when it was trading near $230. A move back above $125 would be a critical shift, potentially invalidating the current downtrend and opening the door to a short-term recovery. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests that SOL is consolidating. Interestingly, RSI has formed a mild bullish divergence, failing to make a lower low even as the price continued to fall, which could hint at a momentum shift. While Solana meme coins have been quiet this cycle, a new Ethereum-based project is starting to make noise. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has already raised over $4 million, bringing meme energy and community-driven trading culture back to the forefront with a fresh approach built around staking, challenges, and shared alpha.

However, newly emerging on-chain activity suggests the Dogecoin price prediction is split between bullish reversal and bearish continuation scenarios. $Doge /daily #Dogecoin has reached the previous symmetrical triangle breakdown target. It's now forming a new chart pattern and searching for a new trend. pic.twitter.com/uWq2WW90yi — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) December 26, 2025 Long-Term Holders Accumulate as Speculative Supply Contracts According to Glassnode data , Dogecoin speculative supply is contracting while longer-term holders display early accumulation signals. The 1-year to 2-year holder cohort has expanded its share of Dogecoin supply from approximately 21.84% to 22.34%. While the increase appears modest, the signal carries significance. Source: Glassnode These holders typically accumulate only when they believe downside risk is beginning to diminish. Network coin activity, measured via the spent coins metric, reinforces this perspective. The on-chain amount spent on coins has plummeted sharply. The spent coins age band metric dropped from roughly 251.97 million DOGE to about 94.34 million DOGE, representing a decline exceeding 60% in coin movement. Reduced coin activity potentially indicates fewer holders are rushing to transfer or liquidate tokens. Historically, similar activity declines have preceded short-term relief rallies in Dogecoin. Earlier in December, a comparable slowdown preceded a rally from near $0.132 to $0.151, a nearly 15% move within three days. Dogecoin Price Prediction: 4-Hour Chart Shows Defined Downtrend Structure The chart shows Dogecoin trading in a well-defined downtrend on the 4-hour timeframe, with price currently hovering around the $0.125 region. Market structure remains bearish, characterized by lower highs and lower lows, and price continues to trade below all highlighted resistance zones. The most immediate level to watch is the $0.12 area, which has been marked as a critical support. Source: TradingView This level is acting as a demand floor for now, but repeated tests weaken its strength, increasing the risk of a breakdown if sellers remain dominant. On the upside, the $0.14 zone stands out as an important resistance, aligning with prior consolidation and multiple rejection points. As long as Dogecoin remains below this level, upside attempts are likely to be corrective rather than trend-reversing. A more meaningful bullish confirmation would only emerge if price reclaims and holds above the broader $0.16 resistance band. Such a move would signal a shift in momentum and could open the door for a recovery toward $0.18 first and potentially $0.20–$0.21, which aligns with the higher target levels marked on the chart. Until then, rallies into resistance are likely to attract selling pressure. Momentum indicators reinforce the cautious outlook. The RSI is sitting near the low-40s, below the neutral 50 level, indicating weak momentum and a market that still favors sellers. While RSI is not deeply oversold, suggesting room for short-term bounces, it does not yet show the strength typically associated with trend reversals. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Presale Brings Solana’s Speed to Bitcoin for the First Time As Dogecoin eyes a breakout, its chances improve if Bitcoin starts climbing toward $100,000 again, especially with gold and stocks hitting new highs. In moments like this, early presales often see the biggest gains, and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is quickly becoming one to watch. Already nearing $30 million raised, the project is building the first true Layer 2 for Bitcoin powered by Solana tech, combining lightning-fast speed and low fees with Bitcoin’s unmatched security. It’s a bold move that could reshape how apps and users interact with the Bitcoin network. As more crypto wallets and exchanges begin adopting this technology, demand for $HYPER tokens is expected to increase substantially.

Price action has narrowed into a tight range, with neither buyers nor sellers able to assert clear control. As volatility compresses, apathy has become a defining feature of the current environment, and an increasing number of analysts are openly discussing the possibility that the market is transitioning toward a broader bear phase. Related Reading: XRP Exchange Reserves On Binance Fall To Six-Month Low: Selling Pressure Is Easing While price levels dominate headlines, on-chain data suggests the more important battle is unfolding beneath the surface. According to CryptoQuant analyst Burak Kesmeci, Bitcoin’s current positioning cannot be understood by price alone. Instead, attention is shifting toward the cost bases of key market participants, particularly whales and Binance spot users. Even with Bitcoin trading around $87,000, the most consequential level sits significantly higher. Data shows that the average cost basis of new whales, defined as holders with coins younger than 155 days, is clustered around $100,500. This zone represents a critical break-even threshold for large players who entered the market recently. As a result, every approach toward $100,000 carries heightened significance. That level may either trigger distribution, as whales seek to protect capital, or mark the start of renewed accumulation if confidence returns. Cost Basis Data Maps Bitcoin Real Support and Resistance The report highlights that beneath Bitcoin’s current price action, cost basis data offers a clearer framework for understanding market risk. For Binance spot users, the average cost basis sits near $56,000. This level represents the largest concentration of spot volume in the market and effectively defines the “deep water” zone if conditions deteriorate. In a prolonged bearish phase, $56K is where the bulk of spot holders would be tested, making it a critical long-term support area rather than a short-term trading level. Long-term whale positioning adds another important layer. The cost basis for whales holding Bitcoin longer than 155 days is clustered around $40,000. This means these participants are still sitting on profits of more than 2x, even after the recent correction. That profit cushion helps explain the rise in realized gains seen over recent weeks. For many long-term holders, current prices already represent a satisfactory exit, increasing the incentive to distribute into strength rather than aggressively accumulate. Taken together, the data reframes Bitcoin’s market structure. The key short-term ceiling remains near $100,000, where newer whales approach breakeven and supply tends to emerge. On the downside, $56,000 stands out as the level where spot market conviction would be most severely tested. Related Reading: Ethereum Bearish Structure Meets Bullish Supply Signal – What Happens Next Bitcoin Consolidates Above Key Weekly Support as Momentum Cools Bitcoin is trading near the $88,700 level on the weekly chart, stabilizing after a sharp pullback from the $120,000–$125,000 highs reached earlier this cycle. While the broader uptrend from 2024 remains intact, recent price action signals a clear slowdown in momentum. The market has shifted from an impulsive expansion phase into a corrective and consolidative structure, with volatility compressing around a critical support zone. Technically, Bitcoin is holding just above its rising medium-term moving average, which has acted as dynamic support throughout this bull cycle. The rejection above $110,000 marked a decisive loss of upside control, and the failure to quickly reclaim that zone suggests distribution rather than a brief pause. At the same time, price remains well above the long-term moving average, reinforcing that this move is still corrective within a larger trend, not yet a confirmed trend reversal. Related Reading: Bitcoin and Ethereum Coinbase Inflows Collapse While Binance Retains Relative Activity – Details Volume dynamics support this interpretation. Selling pressure expanded during the initial breakdown, but recent weeks show declining volume as price stabilizes between roughly $86,000 and $90,000. This points to seller exhaustion, though buyers have yet to step in with conviction. Structurally, the $86,000–$88,000 range is pivotal. Holding this zone keeps the higher-timeframe bullish structure alive. A clean breakdown would expose deeper downside. While a recovery above $95,000 would be needed to reassert bullish momentum and reopen the path toward prior highs.

This development sends shockwaves through the digital asset industry, highlighting persistent security vulnerabilities. Authorities accuse the individual of providing system access to hackers in exchange for cash payments. Consequently, this case raises critical questions about insider threats within cryptocurrency platforms. Coinbase Employee Arrested in Major Security Breach Indian law enforcement officials detained the Coinbase employee following an investigation into unauthorized access at the exchange. Bloomberg’s initial report indicates the arrest occurred in a major metropolitan area. The employee allegedly compromised internal systems. Furthermore, this incident represents one of the most significant insider threat cases in recent cryptocurrency history. Security experts immediately expressed concern about the implications for user funds and data protection. Coinbase confirmed it is cooperating fully with international authorities. The exchange emphasized its commitment to security protocols. However, this arrest follows a pattern of increasing cyber threats targeting cryptocurrency platforms. For instance, 2024 witnessed several high-profile exchange breaches globally. These incidents collectively resulted in millions of dollars in losses. Therefore, the industry faces mounting pressure to enhance internal controls. Cryptocurrency Exchange Hacking Trends and Patterns Insider threats represent approximately 30% of all security incidents in financial technology according to recent cybersecurity reports. The cryptocurrency sector proves particularly vulnerable due to its rapid growth and technical complexity. Moreover, exchanges manage billions in digital assets daily. This concentration of value attracts sophisticated criminal elements. Consequently, platforms must implement multi-layered security frameworks. Recent Major Exchange Security Incidents (2023-2024) Exchange Incident Type Estimated Loss Primary Vector Coinbase (2025) Insider Threat Under Investigation Employee Access Multiple Platforms (2024) Smart Contract Exploit $320 Million Code Vulnerability Asian Exchange (2023) Phishing Attack $45 Million Social Engineering Decentralized Exchange (2024) Bridge Hack $190 Million Protocol Weakness This table illustrates the diverse attack vectors threatening cryptocurrency exchanges. Insider threats remain especially difficult to detect and prevent. Traditional security measures often focus on external defenses. However, authorized personnel with malicious intent can bypass these protections. The Coinbase case demonstrates this vulnerability clearly. Security analysts now advocate for behavioral monitoring and zero-trust architectures. Expert Analysis of Insider Threat Management Cybersecurity specialists emphasize several critical measures for preventing insider threats. First, exchanges must implement strict access controls following the principle of least privilege. Second, continuous monitoring of employee activities provides early warning signs. Third, regular security audits identify potential vulnerabilities. Finally, comprehensive employee screening and ongoing training create a security-conscious culture. Blockchain forensic firms already assist in investigating the Coinbase incident. These companies specialize in tracing cryptocurrency transactions across public ledgers. Their techniques help identify fund movements following security breaches. Additionally, international law enforcement cooperation has improved significantly in recent years. This collaboration enables faster response to cross-border cryptocurrency crimes. India Crypto Security Incident and Regulatory Response India’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation has evolved considerably. The country implemented strict anti-money laundering rules for virtual digital assets in 2023. These regulations require exchanges to maintain detailed transaction records. Furthermore, Indian authorities now actively pursue cryptocurrency-related crimes. The arrest of the Coinbase employee demonstrates this increased vigilance. The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) likely participated in the investigation. This agency handles cybersecurity threats nationwide. Their involvement suggests the technical complexity of the case. Additionally, the Financial Intelligence Unit India monitors suspicious transactions. Their data possibly contributed to identifying the alleged insider threat. Enhanced Due Diligence: Exchanges now face pressure to strengthen employee screening processes. Technical Safeguards: Multi-signature wallets and transaction limits gain importance. International Cooperation: Cross-border investigations become standard practice. Insurance Coverage: Demand for cryptocurrency insurance products increases significantly. User Protection: Platforms emphasize security features like withdrawal whitelists. These developments reflect the industry’s response to security challenges. However, balancing security with usability remains difficult. Excessive controls can hinder legitimate user activities. Therefore, exchanges must find optimal security configurations. The Coinbase incident will undoubtedly influence industry standards globally. Broader Implications for Exchange Security Protocols The alleged insider threat at Coinbase affects the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Investors naturally question the safety of their assets on centralized platforms. Consequently, exchanges face renewed scrutiny of their security practices. Regulatory bodies may introduce stricter requirements for personnel management. Additionally, insurance providers could adjust their coverage terms and premiums. Decentralized exchanges might benefit from increased user adoption following this incident. These platforms eliminate central points of failure by design. However, they present different security challenges including smart contract risks. Therefore, no perfect solution exists currently. The industry continues developing hybrid approaches combining centralized and decentralized elements. Security researchers emphasize several emerging technologies for preventing insider threats. Artificial intelligence systems can analyze employee behavior patterns. Blockchain-based access logs create immutable audit trails. Biometric authentication adds another security layer. These technologies collectively reduce but cannot eliminate risks entirely. Human factors remain the most unpredictable element in security equations. Conclusion The Coinbase employee arrested in India represents a significant moment for cryptocurrency security. This incident highlights the persistent threat of insider attacks within digital asset exchanges. The industry must address this vulnerability through technological and procedural improvements. International cooperation between regulators and law enforcement proves essential for investigating such cases. Ultimately, security remains the foundation for mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. Exchanges that demonstrate robust protection mechanisms will maintain user trust despite these challenges. FAQs Q1: What exactly did the Coinbase employee allegedly do?

This clarification, issued from Zug, Switzerland, on March 15, 2025, directly addresses community concerns that emerged following the rejection of a high-stakes proposal for the Aave DAO to absorb Aave Labs. The situation underscores the persistent tension between founder vision and community-led governance in the maturing DeFi sector. Aave Governance Faces Scrutiny After Major Token Acquisition The controversy centers on a significant transaction executed by Kulechov. Blockchain analytics firms publicly recorded the purchase of a substantial amount of AAVE tokens, worth approximately $15 million, from the open market. Consequently, this transaction occurred during a sensitive period for the Aave decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Specifically, the community was actively debating Proposal AIP-121, which sought to formalize and fund a renewed scope of work for Aave Labs, the protocol’s primary development team, by having the DAO absorb it. The proposal ultimately failed to reach the required consensus threshold. Following the proposal’s rejection, some community members expressed apprehension. They questioned whether the founder’s large-scale token acquisition could potentially sway future governance votes, undermining the decentralized ethos of the protocol. In response, Kulechov provided a clear statement to several crypto news outlets. He confirmed the factual nature of the purchase but emphasized a critical distinction: he did not utilize these newly acquired tokens in any governance voting related to the proposal. “My commitment has always been to the protocol’s long-term health, not to centralizing decision-making power,” Kulechov stated. Understanding the Mechanics of Aave’s Decentralized Governance To fully grasp the implications, one must understand how Aave governance operates. The Aave DAO uses a token-based voting system where one AAVE token typically equals one vote. Holders can delegate their voting power to representatives or vote directly on proposals that dictate the protocol’s future, including: Parameter adjustments: Changes to interest rates, collateral factors, and asset listings. Treasury management: Decisions on fund allocation from the community treasury. Strategic partnerships: Approvals for integrations and ecosystem expansions. Developer funding: Proposals like AIP-121 to resource core development teams. Therefore, large token acquisitions by influential figures naturally attract scrutiny. The system’s integrity relies on the assumption that voting power is distributed and not susceptible to undue concentration. Aave’s governance dashboard shows that voting power is distributed among thousands of addresses, but a subset of large holders, often called “whales,” can exert significant influence. The Delicate Balance Between Founders and DAOs This event is not isolated in the DeFi landscape. Experts point to a recurring pattern where founding teams and DAOs navigate a complex relationship. “The transition from founder-led startup to community-owned protocol is the most challenging phase in DeFi,” notes Dr. Elena Torres, a researcher at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. “Founders retain deep expertise and vision, but the community rightly guards against centralization. Transparent communication, as seen here, is essential for maintaining trust.” The table below contrasts typical founder motivations with community concerns in such scenarios: Potential Founder Motivation Common Community Concern Signal long-term belief in the protocol Attempt to control governance outcomes Personal financial investment strategy Creation of a centralized decision-making point Align incentives with token holders Reduction of the protocol’s censorship resistance Historical Context and Precedents in DeFi Governance The Aave situation echoes past debates within other major protocols. For instance, the Uniswap DAO has repeatedly discussed the role of Uniswap Labs and its founders. Similarly, Compound Finance has seen proposals that adjust the balance of power between its founding team and COMP token holders. These precedents show a sector-wide evolution. Initially, many protocols launched with significant founder and venture capital allocations. Over time, successful protocols work to decentralize this control through community grants, broad token distributions, and transparent governance processes. In Aave’s case, the protocol has historically demonstrated a strong commitment to decentralization. The Aave DAO controls a treasury worth billions of dollars and has successfully passed numerous proposals without major controversy. The reaction to Kulechov’s purchase, therefore, reflects the community’s vigilance rather than a systemic failure. It highlights an advanced stage of governance maturity where participants actively police potential conflicts of interest. Market Impact and Protocol Performance Metrics Analyzing the market response provides further context. Following the news of both the proposal rejection and the clarification, the AAVE token price showed short-term volatility but quickly stabilized. More importantly, key protocol health metrics remained robust. According to data from DeFiLlama, Aave’s total value locked (TVL) across its V2 and V3 deployments has held steady above $12 billion. Furthermore, the protocol continues to generate significant revenue from borrowing fees, indicating that user activity and trust in the underlying lending markets were not materially affected by the governance discussion. This resilience suggests that the market distinguishes between governance debates and fundamental protocol utility. “Sophisticated participants understand that public disputes over governance are a feature, not a bug, of a healthy DAO,” says Marcus Chen, a partner at a crypto-focused hedge fund. “It shows the system is working. The real risk is apathy, not debate.” The Path Forward for Transparent DeFi Governance This episode offers several lessons for the broader decentralized finance ecosystem. First, it underscores the need for clear communication from key stakeholders during sensitive governance periods. Kulechov’s prompt clarification helped mitigate uncertainty. Second, it highlights potential areas for governance model innovation. Some communities are experimenting with: Time-locked governance tokens: Vesting schedules that prevent immediate voting use after purchase. Reputation-based systems: Supplementing token voting with non-financial reputation scores. Improved transparency dashboards: Real-time tools that track voting power concentration and delegate activity. For Aave specifically, the path forward likely involves continued dialogue. The DAO may revisit aspects of its working relationship with Aave Labs in a new proposal. The community’s demonstrated engagement is a positive sign for the protocol’s decentralized future. Conclusion The clarification from Aave founder Stani Kulechov regarding his $15 million AAVE token purchase has served as a critical stress test for the protocol’s governance framework. While the transaction raised valid questions about potential influence, the subsequent public discourse and the founder’s transparency have ultimately reinforced the robustness of community-led oversight. This event exemplifies the maturing nature of Aave governance , where vigilance, communication, and a commitment to decentralized principles help navigate complex situations. As DeFi continues to evolve, such transparent resolutions set a vital precedent for balancing founder expertise with the immutable requirement for decentralized control. FAQs Q1: What was the Aave DAO proposal that was rejected? The rejected proposal, AIP-121, sought for the Aave DAO to formally absorb and fund Aave Labs, the protocol’s primary development team, with a renewed scope of work and budget. It did not achieve the necessary consensus to pass. Q2: Did Stani Kulechov use the newly purchased tokens to vote? No. Kulechov explicitly clarified that while the $15 million token purchase was factual, he did not use those specific tokens to participate in governance voting on the AIP-121 proposal or any other recent measures. Q3: Why do large token purchases by founders concern DeFi communities? Large purchases can concentrate voting power, potentially allowing a single entity to unduly influence the direction of a supposedly decentralized protocol. This conflicts with the core DeFi principles of censorship resistance and distributed control. Q4: How did the AAVE token and protocol performance react to this news? The AAVE token experienced short-term volatility but quickly stabilized. More importantly, fundamental protocol metrics like Total Value Locked (TVL) and revenue generation remained strong, indicating underlying user trust was not damaged. Q5: What does this event mean for the future of Aave governance? The event demonstrates an actively engaged community and may lead to discussions about governance model improvements, such as time-locks on voting power for newly acquired tokens. It reinforces that transparent communication is essential for maintaining trust in a DAO.

China has announced new regulations that will make it significantly easier for commercial rocket companies developing reusable launch technology to access public capital markets. New requirements to list on the STAR marke t T he Shanghai Stock Exchange revealed on Friday that firms working on reusable rockets can now bypass standard financial requirements like profitability limits and minimum revenue requirements when listing on the tech-focused STAR market. These firms will instead be required to demonstrate that they have achieved at least one successful orbital launch using their reusable rocket technology. The United States currently dominates the reusable rocket sector, with SpaceX’s Falcon 9 being the only regularly operational reusable rocket system that routinely delivers satellites into orbit. Earlier in December, LandSpace, China’s leading private rocket manufacturer, conducted the country’s first full test of a reusable rocket with its new Zhuque-3 model. The launch successfully placed a satellite into orbit using reusable rocket technology, but the mission did not complete the critical step of recovering the rocket’s first-stage booster. China’s commercial space ambitions and national security priorities were not helped much by the half-full, half-empty outcome of the mission. China aims to deploy tens of thousands of satellites into low-Earth orbit within the coming decades, creating a large network of constellations that would rival or exceed SpaceX’s Starlink network . The country’s officials believe that SpaceX’s dominant position in the industry is a national security concern. The country is actively deploying two major satellite megaconstellations including the Guowang network, which is managed by state-owned China Satellite Network Group and plans to deploy up to 13,000 satellites. The networ k al ready launched over 100 satellites as of November 2025. The Qianfan constellation, backed by Shanghai’s municipal government, aims to deploy approximately 15,000 satellites by 2030 and has launched around 90 satellites to date. Starlink currently has 6,800 active satellites. Is the new regulation necessary? LandSpace has stated publicly that it will need access to China’s capital markets to remain competitive with SpaceX. Similar to other high-tech sectors where companies require massive upfront investment before generating profits by removing profitability and revenue barriers, the Shanghai Stock Exchange is giving rocket companies the opportunity to raise substantial funds from public investors, even while their products remain in development stages. LandSpace received 900 million yuan ($123 million) from China’s National Manufacturing Transformation and Upgrading Fund in December 2024. The company filed preliminary documents with Chinese regulators in late July, and could launch an initial public offering in early 2026. The Shanghai Stock Exchange previously changed its regulations in June to make it easier for pre-profit innovative companies to list on the STAR market . The new guidelines also prioritize companies that take up national missions or participate in major state-led space projects. LandSpace has announced plans to attempt a complete rocket recovery in mid-2026 during the second launch of its Zhuque-3 system. Aside from LandSpace, other Chinese state-owned enterprises and private companies are now rushing to test their own reusable rocket designs, with access to the capital needed for rapid development and scaling.

This move signals a profound shift in the Bitcoin mining ecosystem as operators globally confront shrinking profit margins. The company’s decision affects its entire product lineup, including the popular Antminer S19 and newer S21 series. Consequently, industry analysts view this development as a critical indicator of broader market pressures. Bitmain Mining Rigs Discount: Analyzing the Immediate Catalyst Bitmain’s discount announcement follows a sustained period of declining mining profitability. According to industry data from Cointelegraph, the current hash rate price has fallen below the minimum operational threshold for many mining operations. This metric represents the revenue generated per unit of computational power. Therefore, miners face difficult decisions about equipment upgrades and operational scaling. The company now offers significant price reductions across most inventory. Additionally, Bitmain has implemented an auction-based sales model for select products. This approach contrasts sharply with the fixed pricing typically maintained during bull markets. Historically, mining hardware manufacturers maintain stable pricing during industry expansions. However, the current market conditions necessitate aggressive inventory management. The Bitcoin network’s hash rate continues reaching new highs. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin price has remained relatively stagnant against rising energy costs. Consequently, mining efficiency becomes the paramount concern for operators. Bitmain’s response reflects these harsh economic realities. The company aims to stimulate demand during a cyclical downturn. Furthermore, this strategy helps clear existing inventory before next-generation hardware releases. Understanding the Mining Profitability Equation Bitcoin mining profitability depends on several interconnected variables. Operators must constantly calculate their break-even points. Key factors include electricity costs, hardware efficiency, network difficulty, and Bitcoin’s market price. Recently, the global average electricity price for miners has increased by approximately 18%. Simultaneously, the network difficulty has surged by over 40% in the past year. These combined pressures squeeze operator margins dramatically. The hash price metric provides the clearest profitability indicator. This value represents the expected daily revenue from one terahash per second of mining power. Currently, this figure sits near multi-year lows. The following table illustrates the changing economics for a standard mining operation: Metric 2023 Average 2025 Current Change Hash Price (USD/TH/s/day) $0.085 $0.052 -38.8% Network Difficulty 52.3T 86.7T +65.8% Global Avg. Electricity Cost (USD/kWh) $0.045 $0.053 +17.8% S19 XP Hydro Profitability (Est.) $12.50/day $4.20/day -66.4% These numbers explain the urgent need for hardware efficiency improvements. Newer mining rigs like the S21 series offer better joules per terahash ratios. However, their upfront cost previously created prohibitive capital expenditure requirements. Bitmain’s discounts directly address this barrier. The company effectively lowers the entry point for efficiency upgrades. Moreover, this move may accelerate the retirement of older, less efficient hardware globally. Such transitions typically benefit network sustainability long-term. Industry Expert Perspectives on the Strategic Shift Industry analysts interpret Bitmain’s actions through multiple lenses. Some experts view the discounts as a routine inventory cycle management tactic. Others see a strategic response to increased competition from emerging manufacturers. Companies like MicroBT and Canaan have gained market share recently. Consequently, Bitmain must defend its dominant position aggressively. The auction model introduction represents another significant development. This mechanism allows market forces to determine fair value dynamically. It also provides Bitmain with real-time demand data for production planning. Mining pool operators report increased interest in hardware upgrades following the announcement. However, they caution that discounted hardware alone cannot solve profitability challenges. Operators must secure low-cost, reliable power contracts. They must also navigate complex regulatory environments. Regions like Texas and Kazakhstan have become major mining hubs. These locations offer favorable conditions but face infrastructure and policy uncertainties. Therefore, hardware acquisition represents just one component of a successful mining strategy. The current downturn may trigger industry consolidation. Smaller operations may merge or seek acquisition by larger, better-capitalized entities. Historical Context and Market Cycle Patterns The cryptocurrency mining industry experiences pronounced cyclicality. Periods of explosive growth often follow technological breakthroughs or major Bitcoin price rallies. Conversely, extended bear markets test operator resilience and efficiency. The current situation mirrors previous downturns in 2018-2019 and 2022. During those periods, hardware manufacturers similarly offered promotions and adjusted sales tactics. However, the scale of Bitmain’s current discounting appears more comprehensive. The inclusion of flagship models like the S19 series demonstrates particular urgency. This series has represented the industry workhorse for several years. Previous cycles show that strategic hardware acquisitions during downturns can yield significant advantages. Operators who upgrade equipment during low-price periods position themselves optimally for the next expansion. Their lower capital costs translate into faster return on investment when conditions improve. Furthermore, efficient hardware provides operational flexibility during volatile energy price periods. The current discount window may therefore create a strategic buying opportunity for well-capitalized miners. However, timing the market cycle bottom remains challenging. Industry veterans emphasize focusing on long-term fundamentals rather than short-term price movements. Key considerations for operators evaluating Bitmain’s discounted rigs include: Total Cost of Ownership: Calculate purchase price plus estimated energy and maintenance costs. Hash Rate Efficiency: Compare joules per terahash across available models. Reliability and Warranty: Verify service terms and manufacturer support. Future-Proofing: Assess hardware lifespan against anticipated network difficulty increases. Resale Value: Consider secondary market demand for the specific model. Global Impact and Regional Variations Bitmain’s pricing strategy affects mining operations differently across regions. Areas with very low electricity costs, like certain parts of Latin America and the Middle East, may find the discounts particularly compelling. Their operational break-even points are lower, making efficiency upgrades more immediately profitable. Conversely, regions with high energy costs require more careful calculation. European miners, facing energy prices above $0.15/kWh in some areas, need extreme efficiency to remain viable. For them, even discounted hardware may not solve fundamental profitability issues. The discount announcement coincides with shifting geopolitical landscapes for mining. The United States has emerged as the dominant mining hub following China’s 2021 mining ban. American operators now control approximately 40% of the global hash rate. This concentration creates both opportunities and vulnerabilities. Bitmain’s discounts could further consolidate mining power among large, institutional American operators. These entities often have better access to capital and energy contracts. Meanwhile, smaller, decentralized mining operations face increasing competitive pressure. The industry’s evolving structure raises important questions about network decentralization and security. Technological Innovation and Future Hardware Developments Bitmain’s aggressive discounting may also signal impending technological transitions. The company typically reduces prices on current-generation hardware before launching new models. Industry rumors suggest next-generation 3-nanometer chip technology could arrive within 12-18 months. These chips promise another significant leap in energy efficiency. Consequently, miners must weigh discounted current technology against future advancements. Purchasing today’s hardware at lower prices makes sense if the equipment can generate positive returns before becoming obsolete. This calculation depends heavily on Bitcoin price projections and network difficulty forecasts. Manufacturers constantly balance innovation cycles with market demand. The current profitability crisis may accelerate research and development timelines. Companies need to deliver more efficient solutions to restore healthy industry margins. Beyond hardware efficiency, miners explore alternative energy sources and cooling solutions. Some operations now utilize stranded natural gas or integrate with renewable energy grids. Others implement immersion cooling technology to improve hardware longevity and performance. These innovations complement hardware advancements in the pursuit of sustainable profitability. Conclusion Bitmain’s decision to offer major discounts on mining rigs reflects deep structural challenges within the Bitcoin mining industry. The hash rate price decline below minimum profit margins has forced strategic adjustments across the ecosystem. While discounted hardware provides temporary relief for some operators, long-term solutions require broader efficiency improvements and favorable market conditions. The shift to auction-based sales models indicates a more dynamic, market-responsive approach from manufacturers. Ultimately, this period of consolidation and adjustment may strengthen the industry’s foundation. More efficient operations will emerge from this downturn, potentially benefiting the entire Bitcoin network through enhanced security and sustainability. The Bitmain mining rigs discount serves as a clear market signal, highlighting both current pressures and future transformation pathways. FAQs Q1: Why is Bitmain offering discounts on mining rigs now? Bitmain offers discounts primarily due to declining Bitcoin mining profitability. The hash rate price has fallen below many operators’ break-even points, reducing demand for new hardware. Additionally, the company likely aims to clear inventory before introducing next-generation models. Q2: Which Bitmain mining rig models are included in the discount? The discounts apply to most current products, including the widely used Antminer S19 series and the newer, more efficient S21 series. Bitmain has also moved some inventory to an auction-based sales model for dynamic pricing. Q3: How does the current mining profitability crisis affect small-scale miners? Small-scale miners face particular challenges as profit margins shrink. They often lack the capital for efficiency upgrades and may struggle with higher relative energy costs. Some may pause operations or sell equipment during this downturn. Q4: Could these discounts indicate a buying opportunity for new miners? Potentially, yes. Discounted efficient hardware lowers the entry barrier. However, new miners must carefully calculate total costs, including electricity and maintenance, against projected Bitcoin revenue. Success requires access to low-cost power and sound operational planning. Q5: What long-term impacts might this industry downturn have? The downturn will likely accelerate industry consolidation, with larger, more efficient operations gaining market share. It may also spur faster technological innovation as manufacturers compete on efficiency. Ultimately, a leaner, more resilient mining industry could emerge from this period.

The deal surfaced two days ago and landed quietly, as Cryptopolitan reported . No press release showed up. No regulatory filing followed. The only public confirmation we got later on came from a 90-word Groq blog post published after markets closed early for the holiday. Analyst Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein said that Nvidia is now so large it can close a $20 billion agreement on Christmas Eve and the market barely reacts, because really, stocks pretended not to see what’s gong on. Deal structure pulls Groq leaders and assets without a formal takeover CNBC reported that Nvidia agreed to buy selected Groq assets for $20 billion in cash, based on details shared by lead investor Alex Davis. Davis runs Disruptive and said his firm invested more than $500 million into Groq. Disruptive also led the company’s most recent funding round in September, which valued the startup at $6.9 billion. Groq said its founder and chief executive Jonathan Ross, company president Sunny Madra, and several senior leaders will join Nvidia to help scale the licensed technology. The post also stated that Groq will keep operating as an independent business. Simon Edwards, the company’s finance chief, will lead what remains of the firm. If this had been a clean acquisition, it would have been the largest in Nvidia’s 32-year history. The company’s biggest past deal was the 2019 Mellanox purchase, which came in just under $7 billion. This time, the structure looks different by design. The agreement is labeled a non-exclusive license, not a takeover. That setup follows a recent pattern across Big Tech. Companies are spending billions to bring in AI talent and hardware knowledge without triggering full merger reviews. Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have all used similar approaches. Nvidia used the same playbook in September when it paid more than $900 million to hire Enfabrica CEO Rochan Sankar and staff while licensing that startup’s technology. Cryptopolitan has analyzed that this format helps deals close faster, while also limiting direct antitrust exposure. Per data from Yahoo Finance, NVDA surged by 1.3% on Friday’s closing bell at $190.53, and the stock is up 42% this year and has climbed more than 13x since the end of 2022 when OpenAI first released ChatGPT. According to Nvidia’s last earnings report in Q3 2025, the most valuable company on earth holds $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, which is massively up from the $13.3 billion it had just 2 and a half years ago in Q3 2023. Nvidia is playing it smart with Groq deal; offense and defense Groq was founded in 2016 by former engineers, including Ross, who helped create Google’s tensor processing units, or TPUs, which some firms use instead of graphics processors. Groq focuses on inference, where AI models respond to new data. Nvidia controls most of the training side, where models learn from massive data sets. Cantor analysts said the deal lets Nvidia play offense and defense at the same time, writing that pulling Groq assets in-house prevents rivals from gaining access. The Howard Lutnick-owned company kept its buy rating and raised its price target to $300. BofA also kept a buy rating on NVDA with a $275 target, describing the Groq deal as surprising, expensive, and strategic. They also said that GPU dominance in training does not guarantee control of inference, which may need more specialized chips. Questions remain unresolved. Analysts asked who owns Groq’s language processing unit intellectual property. They also questioned whether that technology can be licensed to competitors and whether Groq’s remaining cloud business could undercut pricing tied to Nvidia’s LPU services. The next chance for public comments will likely come on Jan. 5, when Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks at CES in Las Vegas. Meanwhile, these Magnificent 7 stocks are up 27% year-to-date, following gains of 107% in 2023 and 67% in 2024. Since early 2023, their shares are up 338% and drove 45% of the S&P 500’s 18% return this year. Their combined value now sits at $21 trillion, or 34% of the index, per data from S&P Global’s Dow Jones Industrial.

He now credits the so-called “XRP Army” with playing a key role in keeping the token afloat through years of volatility, showing just how powerful a loyal holder base can be. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Needs to Bounce From $1.80 to Target $3 XRP has shed 10% of its value this year, which makes it the 4 th worst-performing token in the top 5. However, in the past 7 days, the token has recovered slightly, posting gains of 0.5% during this period. Meanwhile, trading volumes have increased by 30% in the past 24 hours, and currently account for less than 2% of the asset’s circulating market cap. Source: TradingView Once again, XRP has found strong support at $1.80. This price zone has acted as a strong bouncing pad four times already in the past. Meanwhile, a descending triangle has formed as a result of the latest price action. This is a price compression pattern that tends to precede a big breakout. If the price rises above $2.20, this would invalidate the token’s bearish price structure, and a bullish breakout of the triangle pattern would be confirmed. XRP might be eyeing $3 in the near term, especially with big names like Michael Novogratz giving credibility to its long-term vision. But if you’re looking for the next breakout opportunity, a new project is quietly turning heads.

The mess is tied to the Federal Reserve’s shrinking bond portfolio, a tightening plan that’s been in play since mid‑2022. And yes, it’s breaking things. The failed trades involved the most recently issued 10-year Treasury note. That specific batch came from a $42 billion auction held on November 12. The interest rates for lending that security collapsed so badly that some holders agreed to lend it at negative rates, meaning they gave it away cheaper than they got it back. In this type of repo transaction, settlement fails are almost guaranteed. That’s exactly what happened. Fed added less supply to the market in recent auctions Ahead of a Dec. 15 reopening of that same note, traders expected more supply to ease the pressure. That didn’t happen. Instead of the usual market relief, the reopening saw a sharp shortage. This wasn’t the regular “special” rate situation you sometimes see in repurchase agreements. This time, it was worse. And the blame goes to the Federal Reserve again. At that November auction, the Fed only took $6.5 billion worth of the notes for its own books. That’s a lot less than usual. In February, the Fed had added $11.5 billion to a similar-sized sale. In May, it took $14.8 billion, and in August, $14.3 billion. So, what changed? Here’s what changed: the Fed’s maturing Treasury holdings dropped sharply. Their System Open Market Account (SOMA) had just $22 billion maturing on Nov. 15, compared to $45 to $49 billion maturing in previous cycles. And since the Fed only reinvests maturing Treasuries above a certain cap, the amount they rolled over fell too. That cap has changed over time. Back in June 2022, the monthly cap was $30 billion. By September, it doubled to $60 billion. That tightening move directly impacted how much of each auction the Fed could touch. As a result, they didn’t step in to support the November 10-year note the way they had earlier this year. Same thing happened with three-year notes, by the way — smaller add-ons there too. This left traders scrambling to borrow a note that wasn’t widely available. Which meant more failed settlements, more headaches, and yeah, $30.5 billion worth of broken trades in just one week. Yields across Treasury curve change after holiday and strong economic data Markets came back online after the Christmas holiday, and the 10-year Treasury yield barely moved. It fell by less than one basis point, landing at 4.13%. The 2-year yield dropped over 2 basis points, ending at 3.483%. One basis point equals 0.01%, and in the bond world, yields move opposite to prices. The Treasury curve saw these changes on Friday: 1-month: 3.619% (+0.006) 3-month: 3.633% (-0.011) 6-month: 3.585% (-0.014) 1-year: 3.49% (-0.016) 2-year: 3.481% (-0.029) 10-year: 4.13% (-0.004) 30-year: 4.816% (+0.021) The moves came as traders processed fresh economic numbers. The Labor Department said jobless claims fell to 214,000 for the week ending December 20, down 10,000 from the week before. It came in below forecasts. And on top of that, the Commerce Department reported the U.S. economy grew 4.3% in Q1, marking the fastest pace in two years. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Putin Claims US Interest,https://bitcoinist.com/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-crypto-mining-putin-us/,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly said that the United States is interested in using Zaporizhzhia’s nuclear electricity for crypto mining. US & Russia Are In Talks About Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant Russia and the US are negotiating joint control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, according to a report from Kyiv Post , citing Russian business newspaper Kommersant. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is located in Southeastern Ukraine and is the largest nuclear energy facility in Europe. It used to be responsible for more than a fifth of the electricity in Ukraine, but in 2022, Russian forces captured it, and it has since ceased power generation. It would now appear that discussions have emerged about the future use of the power plant. As per the report, Vladimir Putin said at a meeting with major business figures on Christmas Eve that the US is interested in using the plant’s electricity for crypto mining and for supplying power to Ukraine. Crypto mining, the most prominent example of which is Bitcoin mining , can be an energy-intensive process, leveraging computing power to solve mathematical puzzles that allow the operator to have a chance at adding the next block to the blockchain. Crypto mining has features like portability and modularity that have made many consider its application in using waste or excess energy in power grids to produce value in the form of digital assets . On a global scale, Bitcoin mining has seen some rapid expansion during the past three years, with the Hashrate , a measure of the network’s total computing power, expanding by almost five times. Restarting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant for crypto mining, or any other purpose, however, wouldn’t be a simple task. By late 2022, all six reactors of the plant were shut down, with five of them being put in a state of cold shutdown. One reactor was kept in hot shutdown to produce steam for nuclear safety purposes. Even so, the plant isn’t in a state where a restart is possible, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). As the IAEA wrote in a press release earlier this year: Nuclear safety remains precarious at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) and its six reactors cannot be restarted as long as the military conflict continues to jeopardize the situation at the site, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi told IAEA Member States this week. Given this context, it only remains to be seen whether any reported negotiations around the nuclear power plant will actually lead it to be used for any energy-related purpose, crypto mining or otherwise.

His argument draws from the current condition of Japan’s currency environment, its longstanding collaboration with Ripple, and the need for faster cross-border payment systems in the Asian region. Japan has been navigating persistent volatility in the yen and shifts in monetary policy, which White believes could push financial institutions to seek faster settlement options. In situations where capital moves quickly, systems that reduce settlement time may prove beneficial. XRP, he said, fits this requirement due to its ability to settle transfers instantly without requiring pre-funded liquidity pools. Why Japan Could Become $XRP First Full-Scale Use Case When FX volatility spikes and the yen cracks, institutions don’t wait, they move capital fast. That’s where XRP fits in. Instant liquidity, real-time FX, and cross-border flow without pre-funding. Japan’s largest… pic.twitter.com/xgMXM4DIfR — Paul White Gold Eagle (@PaulGoldEagle) December 22, 2025 Japan’s Position in the XRP Discussion Japan stands out in the XRP adoption conversation largely because of its existing ties with Ripple through SBI Holdings . This partnership history means Japanese banks and remittance firms are likely to adopt XRP-based systems faster than others, since they’ve already worked together. White emphasized that the focus should extend beyond market price discussions and include FX stress, liquidity demands, and geopolitical influence. Japan plays a central role in capital movement across Asia, meaning inefficiencies in its currency pipeline can have wider effects. Under such circumstances, a blockchain settlement asset may serve as a neutral channel for international transfers without interfering with monetary policy. Evidence of interest already exists. In September 2023, SBI announced plans to utilize XRP for overseas fund transfers across four Asian countries, highlighting early progress in practical application rather than speculation. To evaluate the potential financial effect if Japan adopts XRP extensively, several pricing possibilities can be outlined using current market data. XRP trades around $1.87 at the time of writing. With this as a reference point, three adoption-based valuation paths are frequently discussed in industry circles. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Base Projection: $3 to $5 Range In a gradual adoption environment where financial institutions integrate XRP mainly for remittances and PHP/JPY settlements, steady usage could influence price appreciation without a supply shortage. This case assumes incremental growth and shared use with other settlement assets rather than singular dominance. Analysts at 24/7 Wall St previously forecast a price window of $3 to $4.5, citing Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD expansion in Japan as a contributing factor. Moderate Projection: $8 to $12 Range Under a scenario where Japanese corporations and banks choose XRP as their primary settlement mechanism, demand could strengthen. Corporate liquidity flows are significantly larger than those through retail remittance channels, suggesting that increased institutional participation may attract more long-term investors. In such a development, analysts consider a move toward double-digit pricing reasonable. High Projection: $15 and Above A more ambitious path assumes Japan’s usage model becomes a benchmark for neighboring markets, encouraging broader Asian integration. To support this outcome, regulatory clarity, deep liquidity reserves, and high-frequency transactional demand would be necessary. Although this is a less conservative assumption, advocates believe regional adoption could reflect structural valuation growth over time. The central takeaway is that future performance for XRP depends primarily on operational deployment rather than short-term speculation. Japan offers a distinct landscape due to its progressive stance on crypto regulation, its economic scale, and existing collaborations with Ripple. Should institutional adoption expand, XRP could transition from a speculative digital asset to a functional element within financial infrastructure. However, these scenarios remain projections rather than confirmed outcomes. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Bitcoin Supply Overhang Could Dictate Volatility & Selling Pressure As pointed out by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, over 6.6 million BTC is being held above the latest spot price of the cryptocurrency. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the “Supply In Loss,” which measures, as its name suggests, the total amount of Bitcoin that’s currently carrying some net unrealized loss. Related Reading: Bitcoin Extreme Fear Streak Extends To 13 Days On Christmas The metric works by going through the transaction history of each token in circulation to determine the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. If this previous transfer price was more than the current spot price for any coin, then that particular token is considered to be in a state of loss. The Supply In Loss adds up all coins fulfilling this condition to find the total situation on the network. A counterpart indicator called the Supply In Profit accounts for the supply of the opposite type. Now, here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Supply In Loss over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Supply In Loss shrunk to a value of zero as the asset’s price set its all-time high (ATH) above $126,000 back in October, but with the market downturn that has followed since then, the indicator’s value has shot up. Today, around 6.6 million tokens of the cryptocurrency sit below cost basis, equivalent to a third of the BTC supply in circulation. The recent highs in the Supply In Loss represent the highest degree of pain in the market since 2023. In another X post, the analyst has shared the chart for another Bitcoin indicator, this one called the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD). The URPD contains information about how much BTC was bought last at each of the levels that the asset has visited in its history. Looks like a significant portion of the supply sits above the spot price | Source: @JA_Maartun on X From the chart of the URPD, it’s visible how the Bitcoin supply that’s in loss is distributed across the various levels right now. A few levels are particularly prominent in the degree of supply that they carry, while some others are notably thin with coins. Generally, investors who are in loss look forward to a retest of their cost basis so that they can get their money “back.” Once this happens, some of these hands decide to exit, fearing that BTC will go down again in the near future. This selling can make large supply clusters above the spot price, potential points of volatility.

This dramatic divergence in institutional strategy, reported by blockchain analytics firm Onchainlens in March 2025, reveals critical insights into the evolving landscape of proof-of-stake validation and corporate crypto treasury management. The contrasting moves by these two significant players highlight the complex risk-reward calculations now dominating institutional cryptocurrency investment decisions. Bitmain’s Major Ethereum Staking Move Analyzed Bitmain’s decision to stake 74,880 ETH represents one of the largest single institutional commitments to Ethereum staking since The Merge transitioned the network to proof-of-stake consensus. The Beijing-based company, historically dominant in Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturing, began accumulating this substantial position over several months according to on-chain data analysis. This strategic pivot toward Ethereum validation signals a fundamental diversification beyond their traditional proof-of-work expertise. Furthermore, the timing coincides with broader institutional adoption trends in cryptocurrency staking products. Industry analysts immediately noted several key implications from Bitmain’s move. First, the commitment demonstrates substantial confidence in Ethereum’s long-term network security and economic model. Second, the scale suggests sophisticated treasury management strategies are becoming standard among crypto-native corporations. Third, the accumulation period indicates deliberate, price-conscious acquisition rather than speculative timing. Blockchain data reveals the ETH was sourced from multiple exchanges and private wallets, suggesting a coordinated accumulation strategy designed to minimize market impact. The Technical Mechanics of Large-Scale Staking Executing a stake of this magnitude requires significant technical infrastructure. Each Ethereum validator requires a 32 ETH deposit, meaning Bitmain’s position represents approximately 2,340 individual validator nodes. Managing this validator fleet demands robust server infrastructure, sophisticated monitoring systems, and dedicated technical personnel. The company likely utilizes either enterprise-grade staking services or has developed proprietary validation infrastructure. This operational commitment underscores the professionalization of institutional staking, moving far beyond retail participation through simple exchange interfaces. Shapelink’s Simultaneous $100 Million ETH Unstaking While Bitmain entered the staking arena, blockchain infrastructure provider Shapelink initiated the unstaking of 35,627 ETH valued at approximately $100 million. This substantial withdrawal represents a significant reduction in their Ethereum network participation. On-chain analysis indicates the unstaking process occurred through multiple transactions over a 48-hour period, suggesting planned treasury reallocation rather than emergency liquidity needs. The company, known for providing node infrastructure services across multiple blockchain networks, has not publicly commented on the strategic rationale behind this move. Market observers have proposed several plausible explanations for Shapelink’s decision. Some analysts suggest portfolio rebalancing toward other blockchain investments or traditional assets. Others speculate about potential strategic shifts in their business model away from infrastructure provision. The unstaking coincides with the full unlocking period post-Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade, which enabled validator withdrawals for the first time. This timing allows institutional players to re-evaluate their staking commitments with newfound flexibility previously unavailable in the locked staking era. Comparative Analysis of Institutional Staking Moves Metric Bitmain Shapelink Transaction Type Staking Deposit Withdrawal Request ETH Amount 74,880 ETH 35,627 ETH USD Value (March 2025) $210 Million $100 Million Validator Equivalents ~2,340 Nodes ~1,114 Nodes Timeframe Multi-month Accumulation 48-hour Execution Network Impact Increased Security Reduced Participation Broader Implications for Ethereum’s Staking Ecosystem These contrasting transactions occur within a rapidly evolving staking landscape. Ethereum’s total staked ETH recently surpassed 30% of circulating supply, representing over $100 billion in committed value. The entry of major institutional players like Bitmain accelerates several important trends: Professionalization of Validation: Large-scale operators bring enterprise-grade security and reliability practices. Increased Network Decentralization: New institutional validators diversify the validator set beyond early stakers. Liquidity Management Evolution: The ability to enter and exit positions influences corporate treasury strategies. Yield Competition: Institutional participation may compress staking yields over time through increased competition. Simultaneously, exits like Shapelink’s demonstrate the maturing liquidity options available to institutional stakers. The unstaking process, once requiring weeks for queue processing, now operates with predictable timelines thanks to protocol improvements. This liquidity flexibility makes staking more attractive to corporate treasuries that require asset accessibility alongside yield generation. Regulatory and Compliance Considerations Institutional staking activities increasingly navigate complex regulatory environments. Different jurisdictions treat staking rewards as interest income, capital gains, or business income for tax purposes. Large-scale operators like Bitmain must implement robust compliance frameworks including: Transaction monitoring for anti-money laundering requirements Accurate reward reporting for tax authorities Geographic restrictions based on regulatory permissions Corporate structure optimization for liability protection These compliance burdens create barriers to entry that may concentrate institutional staking among well-resourced players. However, they also legitimize the activity for traditional financial institutions considering cryptocurrency exposure. The transparent on-chain nature of these transactions provides regulators with unprecedented visibility into institutional crypto activities compared to traditional financial markets. Historical Context and Market Cycle Analysis Bitmain’s substantial ETH accumulation follows a challenging period for mining companies after Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake. The company previously derived significant revenue from Ethereum mining hardware sales before The Merge rendered those products obsolete. Their pivot to staking represents a strategic adaptation to fundamental blockchain protocol changes. Historical data shows mining companies have successfully transitioned to validation services in previous cycles, though rarely at this scale or velocity. Market cycle analysis reveals institutional staking activity often increases during periods of network maturity and regulatory clarity. The current phase follows several key developments: Ethereum’s successful transition to proof-of-stake consensus (September 2022) Implementation of validator withdrawals (April 2023) Growing institutional custody solutions for staked assets (2023-2024) Clearer regulatory guidance in major jurisdictions (2024-2025) These developments have created what analysts term the “institutional staking infrastructure” necessary for large-scale participation. The contrasting moves by Bitmain and Shapelink demonstrate how different institutions interpret the same market conditions through divergent strategic lenses. Conclusion The simultaneous Bitmain ETH staking and Shapelink unstaking transactions reveal a maturing institutional cryptocurrency landscape where sophisticated players execute billion-dollar strategies with precision timing. Bitmain’s $210 million commitment signals strong confidence in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake future and represents a strategic diversification beyond their mining heritage. Meanwhile, Shapelink’s $100 million exit demonstrates the liquidity flexibility now available to institutional stakers, enabling dynamic portfolio management. Together, these contrasting moves highlight the complex risk-reward calculations dominating institutional crypto investment in 2025, with Ethereum staking emerging as a critical arena for corporate treasury strategies and blockchain infrastructure commitments. FAQs Q1: What does staking mean in the context of Ethereum? Staking refers to the process of depositing ETH to activate validator software that processes transactions and creates new blocks on the Ethereum blockchain. Validators earn rewards for securing the network while their staked ETH serves as collateral against malicious behavior. Q2: Why would a company like Bitmain stake such a large amount of ETH? Companies stake ETH to generate yield on their cryptocurrency holdings while simultaneously supporting network security. For Bitmain specifically, this represents diversification from their traditional mining business and positions them within Ethereum’s growing proof-of-stake ecosystem. Q3: How does unstaking work on Ethereum? Since the Shanghai upgrade, validators can initiate withdrawal requests that enter a queue. After processing, staked ETH and accumulated rewards become available in the validator’s designated withdrawal address, typically within days depending on network activity. Q4: What impact do large institutional moves have on Ethereum’s network security? Bitmain’s staking increases the total value securing the network, making attacks more expensive. However, concentration among large validators presents decentralization concerns that the Ethereum community actively monitors and addresses through protocol improvements. Q5: Are staking rewards considered taxable income? Tax treatment varies by jurisdiction, but most countries consider staking rewards as taxable income at the time of receipt. Institutional stakers like Bitmain must implement robust accounting systems to track and report these rewards according to local regulations.

Despite this incremental rise, the index firmly remains entrenched in the “Extreme Fear” category, a persistent state that has defined market sentiment for much of the recent quarter. This data, sourced from Alternative.me on April 10, 2025, presents a complex picture of a market grappling with volatility while searching for a sustainable foundation. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Rise to 23 The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial barometer for the emotional temperature of the digital asset space. Consequently, its movement from 20 to 23, while minor, warrants detailed examination. The index operates on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies “Extreme Fear” and 100 represents “Extreme Greed.” Therefore, a reading of 23 places the market deep within the fear-dominated zone, specifically between 0 and 25. This metric synthesizes data from six core components, each weighted to reflect its impact on collective sentiment. Volatility (25%): This component analyzes price swings, particularly for Bitcoin. Notably, reduced volatility often contributes to a higher index score. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This factor examines trading volume and overall market momentum. Significantly, higher volume with positive price action typically boosts the index. Social Media (15%): Sentiment analysis on platforms like Twitter and Reddit gauges public conversation tone and volume. Surveys (15%): Periodic polls of the cryptocurrency community provide direct insight into investor expectations. Dominance (10%): Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap is a key stability indicator. Trends (10%): Google search volume for “Bitcoin” and related terms reflects mainstream interest and curiosity. The three-point increase likely stems from modest improvements across several of these inputs. For instance, a stabilization in Bitcoin’s price band or a slight uptick in trading volume could trigger the change. However, the overarching “Extreme Fear” classification underscores that these improvements remain fragile and nascent. Historical Context and Market Sentiment Analysis To fully grasp the significance of a score of 23, we must place it within a historical framework. The index has experienced dramatic swings throughout cryptocurrency’s history. For example, it plummeted to single digits during the March 2020 COVID-19 market crash and again following major industry collapses in 2022. Conversely, it soared above 90 during the euphoric peaks of late 2017 and late 2021. Currently, the market’s prolonged residence in “Extreme Fear” contrasts sharply with those periods of unchecked optimism. This persistent fear often correlates with specific market behaviors. Investors typically exhibit risk aversion, favoring stablecoins or off-ramping to fiat currency. Moreover, leveraged positions decrease, and funding rates in perpetual swap markets may turn negative. Importantly, seasoned analysts frequently interpret prolonged fear as a potential contrarian indicator. Historically, accumulation by long-term holders often accelerates during these phases, setting the stage for future rallies when sentiment eventually pivots. Expert Insight on Sentiment as a Lagging Indicator Market strategists and behavioral finance experts emphasize that sentiment indices like the Fear & Greed Index are often lagging, not leading, indicators. “Sentiment reflects the pain or joy of recent price action,” notes Dr. Anya Sharma, a financial psychologist at the Digital Asset Research Institute. “A move from 20 to 23 doesn’t forecast a bull market. Instead, it confirms that the intense selling pressure and negative news flow of the prior weeks may be abating slightly. The market is catching its breath, not necessarily preparing to run.” This perspective is crucial for investors who might misinterpret a small rise as an all-clear signal. The 2025 Regulatory and Macroeconomic Landscape The current sentiment cannot be divorced from the broader environment of 2025. Several key factors continue to exert pressure on investor psychology. First, the global macroeconomic picture remains uncertain, with central banks navigating a complex path between inflation control and economic growth. Higher interest rates have traditionally dampened appetite for speculative assets like cryptocurrency. Second, the regulatory landscape for digital assets is still crystallizing in major economies like the United States and the European Union. While clarity is ultimately positive, the process creates short-term uncertainty. Third, the industry continues to mature post-2022, with a heightened focus on institutional infrastructure, proof-of-reserves, and compliance. This maturation is fundamentally healthy but occurs alongside a decline in the retail speculation that previously drove sentiment to extreme greed. The table below summarizes the primary forces influencing the Fear & Greed Index in the current climate. Factor Impact on Sentiment (2025) Likely Effect on Index Macroeconomic Uncertainty Negative Pressure Pulls score toward Fear Ongoing Regulatory Development Mixed (Uncertainty vs. Clarity) Creates volatility in score Industry Maturation & Institutional Adoption Long-term Positive, Short-term Neutral Provides a floor, limiting extreme fear Reduced Retail Leverage & Speculation Reduces Volatility Can stabilize score, prevent wild swings Practical Implications for Cryptocurrency Investors For market participants, the index provides a valuable tool for emotional discipline. A reading in Extreme Fear suggests that panic selling may be prevalent, potentially creating buying opportunities for those with a long-term horizon and robust risk management. Conversely, it also signals that a swift, sustained recovery is not immediately guaranteed. Investors should use the index not as a standalone trading signal but as one piece of a comprehensive analysis puzzle that includes on-chain data, fundamental project health, and macroeconomic trends. Furthermore, the index’s multi-factor composition reminds us that market sentiment is multifaceted. A rise driven by increased social media volume differs fundamentally from a rise driven by surging Bitcoin dominance. Therefore, savvy observers look beyond the headline number to the underlying components for a more nuanced understanding of the market’s drivers. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s ascent to 23 represents a faint heartbeat in a market still diagnosed with Extreme Fear. This minor improvement reflects tentative stabilization rather than a decisive shift in trend. The index remains a critical gauge of market psychology, deeply influenced by volatility, volume, and social discourse. In the context of 2025’s evolving regulatory and macroeconomic landscape, understanding this sentiment metric is more important than ever for navigating the complex cryptocurrency ecosystem. While the climb from 20 to 23 offers a glimmer of hope, the predominant narrative remains one of caution, underscoring the market’s ongoing journey toward stability and maturity. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 23 mean? A score of 23 indicates the market is in a state of “Extreme Fear,” though it shows a slight improvement from a lower reading. It suggests investor sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, often associated with panic selling or high risk aversion, but may be stabilizing at a low level. Q2: How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? The index is calculated using six weighted factors: volatility (25%), market momentum and volume (25%), social media sentiment (15%), surveys (15%), Bitcoin’s market dominance (10%), and Google search trends (10%). These are combined to produce a single score from 0 to 100. Q3: Is Extreme Fear a good time to buy cryptocurrency? Historically, periods of Extreme Fear have sometimes preceded market recoveries, as prices may be depressed. However, it is not a guaranteed buy signal. Extreme Fear can persist, and prices may fall further. It should be considered alongside fundamental analysis and personal risk tolerance. Q4: How often does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index update? The index updates daily, providing a near real-time snapshot of market sentiment based on the previous 24 hours of data across its various sources. Q5: What is the difference between fear and greed in market sentiment? Fear drives selling, risk-off behavior, and capital preservation, often leading to undervalued assets. Greed drives buying, excessive risk-taking, and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), often leading to asset bubbles and overvaluation. The index measures the balance between these two emotions.

The China-based company adopted this decision after observing the challenges faced in the mining industry. In a statement, TheMinerMag, a specialized digital publication and data platform focused primarily on the Bitcoin mining industry, among other fields, announced that Bitmain has started offering bundle deals and discounts covering various models. Some of these models include the company’s Antminer S19 and S21 series of application-specific integrated circuit mining machines. In early 2025, these series machines would have been perceived as “distressed sales,” that is, when the price of BTC was increasing. Uncertainties surrounding the mining industry sparks tension in the sector Following TheMinerMag’s report, sources pointed out that even the recently launched top-quality mining hardware, such as the S21 immersion-cooled ASICs, is being set for sale with discounts of about $7 per terahash-second (TH/s). What caught many by surprise was recently released news that highlighted that some bundles were actually auctioned off to miners who were given the chance to choose their preferred prices freely. These recent price reductions occurred during one of the most challenging periods for profit margins in the mining industry, according to reports. An example supported this point. In this case, it highlighted the present state experienced in the hashprice. According to the situation, the hashprice, a key Bitcoin mining metric showing the expected daily dollar revenue per unit of hashing power (TH/s or PH/s), has reportedly dropped to a low experienced in years of about $35 per terahash/second per day (TH/s/day). Concerning this finding, it is worth noting that a margin of $40 per TH/s/day is widely recognized as the break-even point for miners. Such a scenario prompts several operators to consider closing down their operations until they are certain that the economic conditions have improved. Meanwhile, reports have noted that the current situation highlights a significant economic challenge in the mining sector, which is reportedly highly competitive even under ideal circumstances. For instance, the sector is facing a decline in the Bitcoin market, price increases for energy, regulatory challenges, and risks associated with the supply chain. To address this situation, the mining firms joined forces to look for other effective solutions. One of the proposed solutions is that the companies are considering renewable energy to cut costs after the halving event in April 2024. This event reduced the block reward to 3.125 Bitcoin per block. Analysts express disappointment after noting 2025 as an amazing year for BTC Regarding the mining companies’ consideration, sources mentioned that the smaller block reward normally gets offset by the surge in Bitcoin’s price every four years. Nonetheless, 2025 came to a disappointing end, despite being anticipated as a remarkable year for the cryptocurrency industry. During the year, the price declined drastically from a peak of more than $126,000, recorded in October, to a low point of around $80,000 in November. Currently, reports from CoinMarketCap indicate that the price of BTC is over 7% lower than its record on January 1 of this year. Additionally, it is around 20% below its highest point of more than $109,000 recorded on January 20. Notably, this record was observed during the day of US President Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration.

This crucial metric, a barometer for market cycle phases, provides a stark and data-driven snapshot of current capital flows. Consequently, understanding this index offers vital context for portfolio strategy and risk assessment during a complex market phase. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index and Its Steady Reading CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index serves as a primary gauge for market sentiment between Bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies. The platform calculates this index by analyzing the 90-day price performance of the top 100 digital assets by market capitalization. Importantly, the calculation excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to focus purely on speculative assets. An official “altcoin season” triggers only if 75% of these top coins outperform Bitcoin during the measured period. Therefore, a score of 16 remains profoundly distant from the threshold of 100, which would indicate overwhelming altcoin strength. This persistent low score underscores a market narrative still heavily centered on Bitcoin’s performance. Historical Context and Market Cycle Analysis Examining historical data reveals clear patterns. Previous bull markets, notably in 2017 and 2021, witnessed the Altcoin Season Index soaring above 75 for sustained periods. During those epochs, capital rapidly rotated from Bitcoin into smaller-cap assets, chasing higher returns. Conversely, the current stagnation at 16 aligns more closely with consolidation or accumulation phases that typically follow major market corrections. For instance, similar index levels were observed in late 2019 before the subsequent market run. This historical parallel provides a framework for analysts to evaluate potential future trajectories, though past performance never guarantees future results. Expert Analysis on Capital Rotation and Investor Psychology Market analysts emphasize that the index reflects deeper capital allocation trends. “A low Altcoin Season Index fundamentally indicates risk-off sentiment or a preference for liquidity,” explains a report from a major blockchain analytics firm. “Investors often retreat to Bitcoin, perceived as digital gold, during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty or regulatory scrutiny.” This behavioral pattern was evident throughout 2023 and into 2024, as traditional finance interest via Bitcoin ETFs solidified its flagship status. Meanwhile, altcoin projects must demonstrate substantial utility or technological breakthroughs to attract capital away from the market leader. The Technical Mechanics Behind the Index Calculation The methodology is rigorous and transparent. First, CoinMarketCap compiles the list of the top 100 coins. Next, it filters out assets designed for price stability. Then, it performs a direct 90-day return comparison for each remaining asset against Bitcoin. Finally, it calculates the percentage that outperformed. This process yields the single-figure index. The 90-day window is strategic; it smooths out short-term volatility while capturing medium-term trend shifts. For traders, this creates a reliable, albeit lagging, indicator of market regime change. Data Set: Top 100 coins by market cap. Exclusions: Stablecoins (USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (wBTC). Time Frame: Rolling 90-day performance period. Benchmark: Bitcoin’s (BTC) price performance. Threshold: 75% outperformance required for “season.” Broader Market Implications and Sector Performance The steady index reading does not imply uniform stagnation across all altcoins. Indeed, specific sectors like decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) or real-world asset (RWA) tokenization have shown isolated strength. However, these movements remain insufficient to move the aggregate index significantly. The broader implication is clear: market-wide, risk capital remains cautious. Major catalysts like Ethereum ETF approvals or definitive regulatory clarity could serve as potential triggers for index movement. Until then, the market appears to be in a holding pattern, building a base for the next cycle. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index holding at 16 delivers a unambiguous message about the current cryptocurrency market structure. Bitcoin dominance persists, reflecting a cautious macro environment and a maturation phase for the broader digital asset class. For investors, this index provides a critical, objective tool to gauge market cycles beyond mere price speculation. Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index for a sustained break above 50 will be essential for signaling a genuine shift in momentum toward alternative cryptocurrencies. FAQs Q1: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 16 mean? An index value of 16 means only a small percentage (roughly 16%) of the top altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the prior 90 days. It indicates a market strongly dominated by Bitcoin’s performance. Q2: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? CoinMarketCap updates the Altcoin Season Index daily, providing a near real-time view of the changing performance dynamics between Bitcoin and major alternative cryptocurrencies. Q3: Has the crypto market ever experienced a true “altcoin season”? Yes, historically. During major bull markets, the index has exceeded 75 for prolonged periods, notably in 2017-2018 and 2021, when capital flooded into altcoins, generating extraordinary returns. Q4: Can the index predict future price movements? The index is a descriptive lagging indicator, not a predictive tool. It confirms a trend that is already in place. However, a sustained rise above key levels can signal a changing market regime that may continue. Q5: Why are stablecoins excluded from the Altcoin Season Index calculation? Stablecoins are excluded because they are designed to maintain a peg to a fiat currency and do not exhibit speculative price appreciation. Their inclusion would distort the measurement of risk-on capital rotation into volatile assets.

Long periods of dominance, followed by a phase where growth slows and attention begins to drift elsewhere. It does not happen overnight. It starts quietly, with capital scanning for opportunities that look less crowded and more flexible. That is the context behind recent conversations pointing toward a $0.035 new cryptocurrency. For those asking what crypto to buy now ahead of 2026, this shift is becoming easier to understand. Rather than abandoning Bitcoin, many early holders are simply looking to complement it. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin remains the largest and most recognized cryptocurrency in the world. Its market cap sits far above every other digital asset, and its role as a store of value is firmly established. Early investors benefited enormously as BTC moved from double digits to five figures. Today, Bitcoin faces a different challenge. Price action has struggled to move decisively beyond the $100K zone. Market commentators often describe this level as a major resistance area. Breaking above it requires sustained inflows of capital on a massive scale. Some analysts believe that even in a positive scenario, Bitcoin’s upside into 2026 may be limited compared to earlier cycles. Projections often point to modest multiples rather than dramatic growth. A 1.5x or 2x move from current levels would still be significant in absolute terms, but it does not compare to the kind of returns early Bitcoin investors once experienced. This is why some long-term holders are now exploring smaller cryptocurrency projects that offer higher upside potential from lower starting points. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Trying to Build That search has brought Mutuum Finance (MUTM) into focus. Mutuum Finance is a DeFi crypto designed to build a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol focused on real usage rather than short-term attention. The goal is straightforward. Allow users to supply assets, earn yield, and borrow against collateral in a system that adjusts automatically based on market conditions. Instead of fixed incentives, the protocol relies on utilization to balance liquidity and demand. According to official statements shared on X, V1 of the Mutuum Finance lending and borrowing protocol is planned for the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. Core features include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an automated liquidator bot. Initial supported assets will be ETH and USDT. Presale Progress and Why It Matters While early Bitcoin investors are known for patience, they also pay close attention to numbers. Mutuum Finance’s presale has shown steady growth since early 2025. The current token price is $0.035, and participation has expanded consistently rather than suddenly. So far, the project has raised $19.45M, with 18,650 holders taking part. A total of 825M tokens have already been sold. From a fixed 4B total supply, 45.5% is allocated to the presale, which equals roughly 1.82B tokens. Phase 6 of the presale is now over 99% allocated, meaning supply at the current price is almost gone. The official launch price is set at $0.06, which has shaped many of the current growth discussions.. In addition, MUTM is positioned as a utility token within the ecosystem. It is designed to be used for protocol-related interactions, which some analysts believe strengthens long-term demand compared to purely speculative assets. Why Bitcoin Investors Are Paying Attention Bitcoin early adopters tend to look for asymmetric opportunities. These are situations where downside is defined, but upside remains open. Mutuum Finance fits that profile more closely than large-cap assets at this stage. At $0.035, the entry point is still low relative to the planned launch price. Some analysts believe that if adoption develops as expected, MUTM could see 200% to 300% growth shortly after launch. In more optimistic scenarios tied to usage, exchange visibility, and supply dynamics, projections show up to 600% growth into 2026. This is not framed as a certainty. It is a model based on execution and timing. Still, it helps explain why experienced Bitcoin investors are starting to watch this new cryptocurrency more closely. Stablecoin Plans and Oracle Infrastructure Beyond lending and borrowing, Mutuum Finance plans to introduce a stablecoin backed by multiple assets. This design allows borrowers to use diverse collateral rather than relying on a single token. By spreading risk, the system can remain more stable during volatile market conditions. Accurate pricing is essential for any lending protocol. Mutuum Finance’s design anticipates the use of decentralized oracle feeds such as Chainlink, along with fallback and aggregated data sources. These feeds help ensure fair collateral valuation and reliable liquidation triggers. Market commentators suggest that strong oracle infrastructure is often overlooked, yet critical. In a bullish scenario, analysts believe that combining lending, a stablecoin, and reliable price data can support broader adoption over time. The Bigger Picture Security is another area that matters to long-term investors. Mutuum Finance has completed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 token scan score, providing an early layer of confidence. An independent audit with Halborn Security is currently in progress, reviewing finalized lending and borrowing contracts. The project has also launched a $50k bug bounty focused on identifying code vulnerabilities. This proactive approach is often viewed positively by analysts, especially those comparing new cryptocurrency projects against established standards. Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of the cryptocurrency market. Its role is not in question. What is changing is how investors allocate around it. As BTC faces resistance near $100K and its growth profile matures, attention naturally shifts toward projects with earlier-stage potential. Mutuum Finance, priced at $0.035 and nearing the end of Phase 6, represents that kind of opportunity. With a V1 launch planned, strong presale participation, stablecoin development, and multiple security layers, it is entering a phase where early positioning becomes more difficult to find.

56425026,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=254563,1766797211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Pantera Capital’s Strategic $15.39M Ethereum Deposit to Coinbase Prime Reveals Calculated Institutional Move,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/pantera-capital-ethereum-coinbase-deposit/,"BitcoinWorld Pantera Capital’s Strategic $15.39M Ethereum Deposit to Coinbase Prime Reveals Calculated Institutional Move In a significant blockchain transaction capturing institutional attention, two addresses linked to prominent investment firm Pantera Capital deposited 5,264 Ethereum tokens worth $15.39 million to Coinbase Prime this week, according to verified on-chain data from Onchainlens. This substantial movement of digital assets represents one of the most noteworthy institutional cryptocurrency transactions of early 2025, potentially signaling strategic portfolio adjustments amid evolving market conditions. The transaction occurred against a backdrop of regulatory clarity and institutional adoption milestones that have characterized the cryptocurrency landscape throughout the past year. Pantera Capital’s Ethereum Transaction Analysis The blockchain data reveals precise transaction details that merit careful examination. Onchainlens, a respected blockchain analytics platform, identified the two Ethereum addresses through their transaction patterns and historical connections to Pantera Capital’s known wallet activities. The 5,264 ETH transfer represents approximately 0.004% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply, making it a substantial but not market-moving transaction by volume standards. The deposit reached Coinbase Prime, the exchange’s institutional platform designed specifically for high-net-worth individuals, family offices, and corporate entities seeking sophisticated cryptocurrency services. Transaction timing provides crucial context for understanding this movement. The deposit occurred during a period of relative stability in Ethereum’s price, which has maintained a trading range between $2,800 and $3,200 throughout the first quarter of 2025. Market analysts immediately noted several possible interpretations of this transaction. Some experts suggest the move represents routine portfolio rebalancing, while others speculate it could signal preparation for upcoming Ethereum network developments or regulatory considerations affecting institutional holdings. Institutional Cryptocurrency Strategy Evolution Pantera Capital’s transaction history reveals patterns worth noting. The firm, founded in 2013 by Dan Morehead, has established itself as one of the earliest and most successful cryptocurrency-focused investment firms. Their portfolio strategy typically combines long-term holdings with tactical adjustments based on market conditions and technological developments. Previous blockchain analyses show Pantera maintaining significant Ethereum positions since 2017, with periodic adjustments during major market cycles and protocol upgrades. Institutional cryptocurrency custody options have expanded dramatically since 2023. The table below illustrates the progression: Year Primary Custody Method Notable Developments 2021-2022 Self-custody solutions Institutions managed private keys internally 2023 Hybrid approaches Combination of exchanges and specialized custodians 2024-2025 Regulated prime services Platforms like Coinbase Prime offering insured custody Market Impact and Broader Implications The cryptocurrency market responds to institutional movements with particular sensitivity. Large transactions from recognized entities like Pantera Capital often trigger analysis across trading desks and investment committees worldwide. Market data from the past 72 hours shows several related developments. First, Ethereum’s trading volume increased by approximately 18% following the transaction’s public reporting. Second, options market activity indicates heightened interest in Ethereum derivatives, particularly call options with strike prices above $3,500 for quarterly expirations. Several factors make this transaction particularly noteworthy in early 2025. Regulatory developments have created clearer frameworks for institutional cryptocurrency holdings. The SEC’s approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in late 2024 established new pathways for traditional finance integration. Additionally, Ethereum’s ongoing transition to a fully proof-of-stake consensus mechanism has progressed through several successful upgrades, reducing environmental concerns that previously limited institutional participation. Expert Perspectives on Institutional Movements Industry analysts offer varied interpretations of this transaction. Blockchain forensic specialists emphasize the technical aspects. “The movement to Coinbase Prime suggests preparation for potential trading activity or secure custody arrangements,” notes Dr. Elena Rodriguez, a blockchain researcher at Stanford’s Digital Asset Lab. “Institutional players increasingly utilize prime brokerage services for their operational efficiency and regulatory compliance features.” Market strategists consider broader implications. “This transaction size represents meaningful but not extraordinary position adjustment,” observes Michael Chen, chief investment officer at Digital Wealth Management. “The more significant story is the continued institutional engagement with Ethereum despite recent volatility and regulatory scrutiny.” Historical data supports this perspective. Institutional Ethereum holdings have grown steadily since 2023, with quarterly inflows averaging $850 million across regulated platforms. Technical and Operational Considerations Blockchain technology enables unprecedented transaction transparency. The Ethereum blockchain records every transaction with timestamp, amount, and wallet addresses. Analysis of the two sending addresses reveals several characteristics. Both addresses show patterns consistent with institutional rather than individual ownership. They maintained substantial Ethereum balances for extended periods, engaged in relatively infrequent transactions, and previously interacted with known institutional service providers. Coinbase Prime’s institutional features likely influenced this deposit decision. The platform offers several advantages for large-scale cryptocurrency holders: Enhanced security protocols exceeding standard exchange protections Insurance coverage for digital asset custody Direct market access with improved liquidity options Regulatory compliance frameworks meeting institutional requirements Advanced reporting tools for portfolio management and auditing Transaction mechanics followed standard Ethereum protocol procedures. The transfer required payment of gas fees, which averaged 35 gwei during the transaction window, resulting in approximately $42 in network fees. The transaction confirmation occurred within two minutes, demonstrating Ethereum’s improved scalability following recent network upgrades. Historical Context and Pattern Recognition Pantera Capital’s cryptocurrency strategy has evolved through multiple market cycles. The firm initially focused primarily on Bitcoin during cryptocurrency’s early institutional adoption phase. Their portfolio diversification into Ethereum began in earnest during 2017, coinciding with growing recognition of smart contract platforms’ potential. Previous blockchain analyses reveal pattern consistency in their transaction behavior. Pantera typically makes substantial movements during periods of technical transition or regulatory milestone events. The current transaction fits within established behavioral patterns. Similar movements occurred before major Ethereum upgrades, including the Merge transition to proof-of-stake in 2022 and subsequent Shanghai upgrade enabling staking withdrawals. Market conditions in early 2025 present several parallels to previous adjustment periods. Ethereum’s price has consolidated following a 2024 rally, network activity has stabilized after period of high volatility, and regulatory frameworks have reached new clarity levels. Regulatory Environment and Compliance Factors Institutional cryptocurrency transactions increasingly consider regulatory dimensions. The 2025 regulatory landscape differs substantially from previous years. Clearer classification of digital assets, established custody requirements, and reporting standards have emerged across major jurisdictions. These developments reduce uncertainty for institutional participants like Pantera Capital. Compliance considerations likely influenced the Coinbase Prime deposit decision, as regulated platforms provide documented compliance with evolving standards. Tax implications represent another consideration. Large cryptocurrency movements trigger reporting requirements under current regulations. Institutional investors must document transaction purposes, cost basis calculations, and potential tax liabilities. The timing of this transaction, occurring early in the calendar year, may facilitate streamlined accounting and reporting processes for the firm’s 2025 financial activities. Conclusion Pantera Capital’s $15.39 million Ethereum deposit to Coinbase Prime represents a significant institutional cryptocurrency transaction with multiple potential interpretations. The movement highlights continued institutional engagement with digital assets amid evolving market conditions and regulatory frameworks. While the specific motivation behind this transaction remains known only to Pantera’s investment committee, the observable patterns suggest strategic positioning rather than reactive trading. This transaction reinforces Ethereum’s status as a core institutional holding within diversified cryptocurrency portfolios. As blockchain transparency enables detailed transaction analysis, market participants gain valuable insights into institutional strategies and market dynamics. The Pantera Capital Ethereum deposit ultimately demonstrates the maturation of cryptocurrency markets and the sophisticated approaches institutional investors now employ within this asset class. FAQs Q1: What is Coinbase Prime and how does it differ from regular Coinbase? Coinbase Prime is a specialized platform designed for institutional investors, offering enhanced security, dedicated customer support, advanced trading tools, and compliance features tailored to large-scale cryptocurrency transactions and custody needs. Q2: How do analysts link blockchain addresses to specific institutions like Pantera Capital? Blockchain analysts use pattern recognition, transaction history analysis, and sometimes publicly disclosed information to establish connections between wallet addresses and known entities, though absolute certainty requires direct confirmation from the institutions themselves. Q3: What percentage of Ethereum’s total supply does this transaction represent? The 5,264 ETH transfer represents approximately 0.004% of Ethereum’s circulating supply, making it substantial for an individual transaction but not large enough to significantly impact overall market liquidity or price discovery mechanisms. Q4: Why would an institution move cryptocurrency to an exchange rather than keeping it in cold storage? Institutions may transfer assets to exchanges for several reasons including preparation for trading activity, utilization of institutional services like lending or staking, enhanced security through insured custody, or compliance with regulatory requirements for certain types of holdings. Q5: How has institutional cryptocurrency custody evolved in recent years? Custody solutions have progressed from basic self-custody to sophisticated institutional-grade services offering insurance, regulatory compliance, advanced security protocols, and integration with traditional financial systems, reducing barriers to institutional participation.

XRP Forecasts Dipped A recent poll conducted by cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, running from December 12 to 23, reveals that 73% of investors predict XRP will finish the year between $1.50 and $2.00, suggesting a muted conclusion for the altcoin’s performance in 2025. Just weeks prior, market sentiment was more optimistic, with around 38% of traders expecting XRP to rally to a range of $2.00 to $2.50 by December 31. However, that figure has since dropped to 28%, reflecting a significant decline in confidence. Related Reading: Bitcoin Correction Timeline: Analyst Predicts Potential Bottom In October 2026 The possibility of the cryptocurrency exceeding $2.50 appears almost non-existent, as only about 4% of respondents foresee it reaching the $2.50 to $3.00 range, and a similar 4% predict it could surpass $3.00. The consensus of 73% predicting an XRP finish between $1.50 and $2.00 marks an increase from the 63% recorded earlier in the poll. This growing alignment among poll participants indicates that they are consolidating around this range as the most likely scenario. Furthermore, the sentiment towards higher price levels has significantly shifted. The percentage of voters anticipating a rally into the mid-$2 range has dwindled to a mere 4%, reflecting dwindling confidence after several failed attempts to break through resistance levels. Even the outlook for the altcoin’s price to drop below $1.50 has risen slightly to 7%, up from 6%, although most believe a sharp sell-off is unlikely. Rising Supply From Early Investors This prevailing sentiment aligns with Futures data indicating a prevalence of aggressive sell orders, while the slow accumulation of XRP in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) at a pace of $30 to $50 million daily cannot keep up with profit-taking and risk reduction activities in the market. On-chain data reveals that significant realized gains have been secured as XRP approached its recent highs. For instance, a long-term holder who initially acquired the altcoin around $0.40 sold over 350 million tokens at approximately $2.00, reaping an estimated profit of $721 million. Related Reading: Ethereum Fails To Surpass $3,000: Predictions For The Final Days Of The Year With many early investors reportedly cashing out at the $2 level, there has been minimal support for dip-buying to bolster the price, keeping it in the current range between $1.7 and $1.8 recorded in the week. Experts suggest that when the supply increases from long-term holders, whose initial investments were made at $0.40 to $0.60, it creates a resistance ceiling that is challenging to break without substantial new demand entering the market. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $1.830. The altcoin has recorded major losses in all time frames, with a year-to-date decline of 15%, in line with the broader market’s performance.

Speaking on CNBC, the newly confirmed NASA Administrator said the United States will head back to the moon under President Donald Trump’s second term. And this time, it’s for what Jared calls the “orbital economy.” “We want to have that opportunity to explore and realize the scientific, economic and national security potential on the moon,” Jared said during the interview. He pointed directly to Trump’s renewed interest in space, calling it the key to turning the moon into an off-Earth economic hub. The US Senate had finally confirmed Jared’s appointment last week after a chaotic back-and-forth that dragged all through 2025. Trump’s NASA pick returns with space business agenda Trump first picked Jared to run NASA back in December 2024. Then, in May, he suddenly yanked the nomination. No reason was given, but insiders allegedly pointed fingers at Jared’s tight relationship with Elon, since Trump and the latter publicly broke up last summer. But the beef didn’t last. Trump circled back in November and renominated Jared, who already had the astronaut badge after flying on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon in 2021. Now he’s not just aiming for the moon.Jared laid out plans for space data centers, nuclear power, and Helium-3 mining. The rare gas could be a future fuel for fusion reactors and is buried in the moon’s surface. He also wants a permanent base, with nuclear propulsion systems ready to go beyond the moon. That’s not a fantasy. Jared made it clear that these ideas are already in motion. NASA is working with SpaceX, Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, and Boeing under the Artemis campaign, which focuses on building a long-term presence on the moon and preparing for missions to Mars. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act gave this campaign a huge boost by dropping $9.9 billion into NASA’s pocket earlier this year. Artemis II, the first crewed test flight on NASA’s Space Launch System and Orion spacecraft, is scheduled soon. That mission will be followed by Artemis III, with SpaceX providing the lunar landing vehicle. Jared also said both SpaceX and Blue Origin are making reusable heavy-lift rockets using on-orbit cryogenic propellant transfer. He said , “That’s what’s going to enable us to be able to go to and from the moon affordably, with great frequency, and set up for missions to Mars and beyond.” Tesla’s Cybertruck problem gets a SpaceX-sized bailout Back on Earth, Tesla’s numbers are looking ugly. The company is struggling to sell even 20,000 Cybertrucks a year. That’s a far cry from Elon’s original promise of 500,000 units. Warehouses are now overflowing with unsold trucks. Production has already been scaled back. But here comes SpaceX. The company bought over 1,000 Cybertrucks, and they might double that soon. An X user posted a video showing a storage lot filled with the vehicles. With each truck priced around $80,000, SpaceX’s order could total between $80 million and $160 million in Tesla sales. Clearly, SpaceX is now turning into the main source of Elon’s wealth, not Tesla, like we’re used to. If things keep going this way, it will almost certainly even push his net worth over $1 trillion by this time next year.

56429053,648949,1766799056,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56429053.jpeg,Samourai Co-Founder Writes From Prison After Surrender: ‘Confusing And Unnatural’,https://bitcoinist.com/samourai-co-founder-writes-from-prison-after-surrender-confusing-and-unnatural/,"Keonne Rodriguez, a co-founder of the Bitcoin privacy tool Samourai Wallet, began serving a five-year sentence and wrote a letter from inside a US federal prison on Christmas Eve. The letter , shared publicly, offers a short, personal account of intake procedures, the move into housing, and his first days behind bars. He wrote that the place was “confusing and unnatural”, yet “manageable”, and that fellow inmates had treated him with respect. Inside The Prison Letter Rodriguez wrote that he had gone through searches and medical checks during intake, and that he was settling in after what he called an emotional goodbye to family days before the holiday. The note was dated Christmas Eve and marked his seventh day at the facility. Reports said his wife was scheduled as his first visitor on Christmas Day. Those details make the timing — and the human side of the story — hard to miss. Rodriguez was sentenced on Nov. 19 on charges tied to his role in a crypto mixing protocol. His case has become a touchpoint for a wider dispute about whether building or maintaining privacy software can carry criminal liability when others misuse those tools. The debate has drawn comparisons to the prosecution of Roman Storm, a co-founder of Tornado Cash, and raised questions about how the law treats open-source code and the people who write it. Samourai: Legal Debate Over Code And Crime Supporters say Rodriguez’s prosecution threatens free speech and software development. A petition asking for clemency gathered more than 12,000 signatures, and many privacy advocates argue that no direct victims were harmed by his work. In public posts, Rodriguez framed his case as “lawfare” and criticized regulators and judges for targeting innovation. Those claims have been repeated widely in crypto circles. Prosecutors argue differently. They point to the structure and promotion of certain tools and say some actors used them to hide illicit transfers. Courts have faced the hard question of where to draw the line between code as neutral technology and code used to facilitate crime. That tension is central to why Rodriguez’s sentence has drawn such attention from developers, legal scholars, and privacy groups. Samourai Drama: Calls For Clemency Gain Traction US President Donald Trump said on Dec. 16 that he would “take a look” at Rodriguez’s case after it gained public attention. That brief remark kept the possibility of executive clemency in public view, though such reviews do not always lead to action. Rodriguez publicly appealed to the president for a pardon as he began serving his sentence. Public reaction has been mixed. Some see the petition and media coverage as a push to protect open-source developers. Others stress that courts will weigh evidence about intent and conduct, not just the code itself. What remains clear is that this case has pulled the issue into the open and made it harder for lawmakers and courts to ignore.

The arrest, confirmed by both Coinbase and Indian police in Hyderabad, came months after hackers bribed customer service staff to steal customer information. This triggered a $20 million ransom demand and left the company facing a $400 million fallout. The breach began in May, when hackers managed to buy access from Coinbase contractors outside the U.S. and gain entry to internal systems. They didn’t hack through firewalls or code, they just found staff and offered cash. “What these attackers were doing was finding Coinbase employees and contractors based in India who were associated with our business process outsourcing or support operations, that kind of thing, and bribing them in order to obtain customer data,” said Philip Martin, Coinbase’s Chief Security Officer. Coinbase says access was shut down quickly The breach was so wide that it allowed attackers near-instant access to customer accounts for months. This type of social engineering attack has become a growing problem in the crypto world. It’s simple: pay someone on the inside. Philip denied that the hackers had full access the entire time. He said in an interview with Bloomberg News that once the company discovered staff were leaking data, their access was immediately revoked. “They did not have persistent access over the course of the entire period,” he claimed. The arrest was announced on X by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who wrote: “We have zero tolerance for bad behavior and will continue to work with law enforcement to bring bad actors to justice. Thanks to the Hyderabad Police in India, an ex-Coinbase customer service agent was just arrested. Another one down and more still to come.” Not everyone clapped. One user replied under Brian’s post: “lol why you acting like this is a win. You hired them in the first place.” Coinbase faces rising costs and deeper scrutiny Coinbase is still digging out of the mess.The cost of repairing damage and reimbursing affected users could be as high as $400 million, putting it among the top ten biggest crypto hacks ever, according to Elliptic. In February, Bybit suffered a similar attack that cost them $1.5 billion, and in total, $2.2 billion was lost to crypto hacks in 2024, per Chainalysis data. A Coinbase spokesperson confirmed the India arrest and said it followed the firm’s work with the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office, where charges were recently filed against a Brooklyn man accused of running “a long-running impersonation scheme targeting Coinbase customers.” Meanwhile, Coinbase shares slipped 1.2% to $236.79 on Friday, and are now down about 4.6% in 2025. Despite the chaos, Coinbase still holds most of the $122 billion in spot-Bitcoin ETF tokens, and remains a major political player. It’s become the largest crypto donor in U.S. politics, pouring over $52 million into campaigns during the 2024 cycle. The crypto industry overall made up half of the nearly $250 million in corporate political donations, with Coinbase leading the pack, according to watchdog group Public Citizen and data from OpenSecrets.

Roughly $1 trillion left active equity mutual funds as frustration built around weak stock selection and a market that refused to reward diversity. The S&P 500 kept hitting records, but the gains came from the same tight group of seven American tech giants. Owning anything else meant falling behind, and investors noticed. Fund managers who aimed for balance faced a brutal setup. A portfolio packed with many sectors looked sensible on paper, but the market only cared about megacap tech. That gap tested patience, specifically due to how wide it became between those winners and everything else, year after year. Money exits active strategies as market concentration tightens As the year moved on, cash flowed out steadily.Estimates from Bloomberg Intelligence using ICI data show about $1 trillion pulled from active equity mutual funds. That marked the 11th straight year of net outflows and the deepest of the cycle. Passive equity exchange-traded funds moved the other way and took in more than $600 billion. Investors didn’t rush for the exits all at once. They watched performance. Many paid fees for portfolios that looked different from the index. When those differences failed to pay off, patience ran out. Dave Mazza, chief executive officer of Roundhill Investments, said the setup worked against active managers. “The concentration makes it harder for active managers to do well,” Mazza said. “If you do not benchmark weight the Magnificent Seven, then you’re likely taking risk of underperformance.” Some market watchers expected stock picking to shine.Instead, the cost of straying from the benchmark stayed high all year.Market breadth stayed weak. On many days in the first half, fewer than 20% of stocks rallied with the market, based on BNY Investments data. That kind of narrow action can happen, but its length mattered. When gains keep coming from a tiny group, spreading bets hurts results. The same pattern showed up in the indexes. The S&P 500 beat its equal-weighted version all year. For investors, the choice was; go underweight large stocks and lag, or hug the index and explain why an active equity fee made sense. Few active funds beat benchmarks despite isolated standouts In the U.S., 73% of equity mutual funds lagged their benchmarks in 2025, according to Athanasios Psarofagis of Bloomberg Intelligence. That ranked as the fourth-worst showing since 2007. Results got worse after April’s tariff scare faded and excitement around artificial intelligence locked in tech leadership. There were exceptions, but they carried different risks.One came from Dimensional Fund Advisors.Its $14 billion International Small Cap Value Portfolio returned just over 50%, beating its benchmark, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq 100. The fund held about 1,800 stocks, mostly outside the U.S., with large exposure to financials, industrials, and materials. It avoided the U.S. large-cap index almost entirely. Joel Schneider, deputy head of portfolio management for North America, summed it up. “This year provides a really good lesson,” Schneider said. “Everyone knows that global diversification makes sense, but it’s really hard to stay disciplined and actually maintain that.” Another case came from Margie Patel at the Allspring Diversified Capital Builder Fund. The fund returned about 20%, helped by bets on Micron Technology and Advanced Micro Devices. Patel pushed back on closet indexing. “A lot of people like to be closet or quasi indexers,” she said on Bloomberg TV. “The winners are going to stay winners.” Big stocks getting bigger fueled bubble talk. The Nasdaq 100 traded above 30 times earnings and near six times sales. Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, who launched an AI-focused ETF in 2025 that grew to almost $1 billion, said volatility was part of the trade. “There are going to be white-knuckle moments,” Ives said. “We believe this tech bull market goes for another two years.” VanEck’s Global Resources Fund rose almost 40%, driven by demand tied to energy, farming, and metals, as the fund owns Shell, Exxon Mobil, and Barrick Mining, and mixes geologists with analysts. Shawn Reynolds, who has run it for 15 years, said active management allows big thematic bets.

Additionally, it was confirmed that while individuals had expressed excitement earlier, concerns about Zcash’s main token have decreased, and investors have demonstrated increased interest in its privacy features. This growing interest illustrated the fact that several users highly prefer private transactions. The crypto community expresses heightened interest in privacy features Regarding the current situation with Zcash privacy adoption , sources have attempted to explain that the stability surrounding the firm’s interest in privacy features was observed after a lengthy period of rapid growth encountered earlier this year. At this time, privacy solutions were the most preferred option within the crypto ecosystem. Moreover, recently released reports have highlighted that current data indicate that users who utilize these privacy tools continue to do so. Interestingly, a reliable source highlighted that the shift in focus towards privacy has not only increased for Zcash but also been identified in other initiatives. This was after a report earlier noted that other projects have also drawn the attention of several individuals and have increased in value. An example of these projects is Monero . Notably, Monero is a popular cryptocurrency project focused heavily on user privacy and anonymity. It has faced considerable gains, indicating that people have increasingly begun to embrace privacy solutions as they have become widely available across multiple platforms, rather than being restricted to just one platform. Meanwhile, as privacy solutions spread rapidly among users, sources have revealed that development efforts are starting to spread across various ecosystems and blockchains. These efforts are adopted as groups establish privacy-enhancing features purposefully to operate in their unique platforms. This increase witnessed in the crypto industry triggered analysts to predict that there is a high likelihood that the significance of privacy will continue to be embraced in 2026. Based on their anticipation, they clarified that the rise will be influenced by real-world needs rather than speculation, leading to the conclusion that the demand for privacy becomes evident as stablecoin payments and day-to-day on-chain transactions surge. On the other hand, analysts warned that the transparency of public blockchains can make regular payments complex due to the use of an on-chain wallet, which typically discloses one’s entire transaction history to others and their balances. Such a scenario is viewed as a significant privacy issue for both personal and business transactions. Grayscale undertakes an important step in the crypto ecosystem The heated discussions between the openness of blockchain technology and the demand for user privacy have prompted several individuals in the ecosystem to agree with the earlier argument, implying that privacy solutions will continue to be valued as crucial in this time when cryptocurrencies are moving towards practical payment uses. However, speculative interests change to other topics. In the meantime, reports last month noted the entry of a privacy coin to Wall Street. This statement highlights that the crypto ecosystem underwent a period when a technology designed to promote privacy was forced to operate within the highly regulated system of international finance. This situation was identified as Grayscale’s attempt to list a Zcash ETF on NYSE Arca with ticker ZCSH. With this move, sources acknowledged that Grayscale has taken a significant step in the industry to integrate a privacy coin into its comprehensive, transparent ecosystem of ETF filings, approved custodians, sanctions checks, and brokerage regulations. Ideally, the entire project serves as a test for a straightforward question: “Is it possible for privacy to be maintained under regulation, or does regulation fully overshadow privacy?” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

He believes such views are based on incomplete assumptions and overlook how value moves through global financial networks. As of this writing, XRP trades around $1.84, far below the level Jesse sees as achievable if adoption expands. Assessment of Transaction Scale Versus Cryptocurrency Valuation Jesse’s stance is rooted in payment throughput rather than speculation. He notes that Bitcoin commands a multi-trillion-dollar market presence but still handles relatively small settlement volume when compared with traditional finance. In contrast, central banks move far greater capital daily, often surpassing what Bitcoin processes across an entire year. From this comparison, Jesse argues that using Bitcoin’s valuation framework to judge XRP’s potential sets inaccurate limits, since both assets operate within distinct use cases and throughput expectations. People saying XRP can't go past $10 really haven't done their research. One Ripple partner (Bank of England) does more volume in one day than Bitcoin in a YEAR and it will use XRP to settle transactions. Wake up people! pic.twitter.com/BAi34TJ9VR — Apex Crypto Insights (NFA) (@APEXCONSULTNFA) December 17, 2025 Institutional Settlement as Ripple’s Strategic Advantage A central point in Jesse’s argument is Ripple’s positioning within financial infrastructure. While Bitcoin is generally treated as a store of value, Ripple has spent years building technology for cross-border payments and banking-grade settlement. Jesse believes this strategic focus gives XRP a different growth path from most digital assets. He highlights Ripple’s existing engagement with financial institutions and future opportunities for integration with banks and potentially central banks. If XRP becomes a settlement asset within systems that process significant liquidity, Jesse asserts that transactional volume could scale beyond what market-cap projections typically model. The Central Bank Dimension and the $10 Projection Jesse also calls attention to how many monetary authorities exist globally. With more than 170 central banks worldwide, he argues that focusing only on one example understates potential infrastructure demand. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In his view, claims that XRP cannot exceed $10 rely heavily on static market-cap calculations, without accounting for liquidity cycles, high-frequency settlement, or institutional utility. He rejects the idea that XRP’s valuation ceiling must remain low based on past performance, asserting that pricing models must also consider payment velocity in large transactions. Jesse maintains that XRP’s purpose is transactional rather than speculative, and price movements may lag behind real-world usage. He suggests that investors who base expectations solely on historical price action may overlook longer-term utility-driven appreciation. Reaching $10 from current prices would require roughly a five-fold increase and place XRP’s market capitalization near $600 billion, surpassing Ethereum’s previous valuation range. Although Jesse supports the likelihood of double-digit pricing under significant adoption, the view is not universal. Some observers believe such projections are optimistic, given that XRP has not sustained prices above $3.84 in nearly a decade. Others note that growing institutional accumulation and ETF activity could influence valuation trends over time.

The breach has impacted hundreds of users, with on-chain data showing that more than $6.77 million has already been stolen. The timing has amplified concern, coming at a moment when investors are already navigating heightened uncertainty, declining prices, and rising risk aversion. Related Reading: XRP Exchange Reserves On Binance Fall To Six-Month Low: Selling Pressure Is Easing According to the Trust Wallet team, the exploit appears to be linked to a recent update to its Chrome browser extension. In a public statement posted on X, the company urged users to take immediate action, stating: “Users with Browser Extension 2.68 should disable and upgrade to 2.69.” The message suggests that the vulnerability was isolated to a specific version of the extension, rather than the core wallet infrastructure, but the scale of the losses has nonetheless raised alarm. Trust Wallet is one of the most widely used self-custody wallets in the industry. Reporting a user base of roughly 220 million people globally. That reach makes any security incident particularly significant, not only because of the direct financial impact, but also due to the broader implications for trust in non-custodial platforms. As investigations continue and affected users assess the damage, the exploit adds another layer of stress to a market already grappling with weak sentiment and elevated skepticism toward crypto infrastructure. Funds Tracked As Trust Wallet Commits To Full Reimbursement On-chain investigators have begun tracing the movement of funds linked to the Trust Wallet exploit. According to analysis shared by Lookonchain, the attacker has already transferred approximately $5.5 million through a combination of instant swap services and centralized exchanges, including ChangeNOW, FixedFloat, KuCoin, and HTX. Routing funds through multiple channels suggests an attempt to obscure flows and accelerate laundering. A pattern commonly observed in recent wallet exploits. Despite the ongoing movement of stolen assets, Trust Wallet has moved quickly to reassure users. Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) publicly stated that Trust Wallet will fully cover all user losses resulting from the incident. This commitment has been central to calming concerns. Particularly given the wallet’s large global user base and the broader climate of weakened trust in crypto infrastructure. The Trust Wallet team later reinforced this position with a formal statement, confirming the scale of the impact and outlining next steps. “We’ve confirmed that approximately $7M has been impacted and we will ensure all affected users are refunded,” the team said. The team added that supporting affected users is the top priority, and they are actively finalizing the refund process. The statement also warned users to avoid interacting with messages that do not originate from official Trust Wallet channels. As fund tracking continues, the focus has now shifted from damage assessment to execution of reimbursements and restoration of user confidence. Altcoin Market Holds Key Support As Broader Structure Weakens The total cryptocurrency market capitalization excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum is trading near the $825 billion level on the weekly chart. Following a sharp pullback from the $1.1–$1.2 trillion highs reached earlier this year. This index, used as a proxy for broader altcoin market health, shows a clear loss of momentum after an aggressive expansion phase. Signaling rising stress across the altcoin sector. Technically, the market has slipped below its faster weekly moving average, which previously acted as dynamic support during the uptrend. That level has now flipped into resistance, limiting upside attempts. Price is currently hovering just above the longer-term moving averages, which converge between roughly $780 billion and $820 billion. This zone represents a critical structural support area. A sustained break below it would likely confirm a broader bearish transition for altcoins. Related Reading: Bitcoin and Ethereum Coinbase Inflows Collapse While Binance Retains Relative Activity – Details From a market-structure perspective, holding the current range keeps the possibility of consolidation alive. However, failure to defend this support would open the door to a deeper retracement toward the $650–$700 billion region. For a bullish case to re-emerge, the altcoin market would need to reclaim the $900 billion level and reestablish acceptance above its key moving averages.

This surge in the RWA sector can largely be attributed to the performance of specific platforms. Notably, Keeta Network has skyrocketed by 1,794.9% YTD, while Zebec Network and Maple Finance have recorded gains of 217.3% and 123.0% respectively. Related Reading: Bitcoin Correction Timeline: Analyst Predicts Potential Bottom In October 2026 Current statistics show that the crypto RWA sector boasts a Distributed Asset Value of $18.88 billion, reflecting a 2.56% increase over the past month. However, the Represented Asset Value has seen a slight decline, standing at $407.93 billion, down 2.36%. For context, RWA’s approach facilitates asset managers and projects the digital transformation of tangible assets, such as real estate and commodities, creating a solid foundation for trading, managing, and securing these assets. Layer-1 (L1) solutions have emerged as the second most profitable narrative this year, achieving an average price gain of 80.3% YTD. The success of this narrative can be attributed to the performance of privacy-focused blockchains such as Zcash and Monero, which have seen rallies of 691.3% and 143.6%, respectively. Another noteworthy crypto narrative, “Made in USA,” is also on track to end the year positively, with average gains of 30.6% YTD, primarily driven by Zcash’s performance that mitigated the moderate losses of other tokens in that category. Top Meme Tokens Suffer Heavy Losses Despite their popularity, narratives such as memecoins and artificial intelligence (AI) have struggled this year, with average returns of -31.6% and -50.2% year-to-date, respectively. Leading memecoins in the crypto space, such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), have demonstrated the volatility of this sector by suffering significant losses of over 60% year-to-date. Similarly, the report notes that many artificial intelligence-focused crypto assets have recorded declines between 49.8% and 84.3%, with only Alchemist AI and Kite performing relatively better.

The decentralized exchange (DEX) narrative has mirrored this decline with average losses of -55.5%, while layer-2 (L2) solutions have also struggled, recording average returns of -40.6% for the second year in a row. At the time of writing, the market’s leading crypto, Bitcoin (BTC), was trading at $88,960, having recorded losses of 10% year-to-date.

56429055,648973,1766804405,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56429055.jpeg,The State Of US Stablecoin Legislation: Unresolved Issues And Challenges,https://bitcoinist.com/us-stablecoin-legislation-issues-and-challenges/,"In a recent report, market expert Colin Wu shed light on the ongoing issues facing the cryptocurrency industry as a result of stablecoin legislation, notably the GENIUS Act, which was enacted in July under President Donald Trump’s administration. While this bill is viewed as a significant win for the digital asset market—anticipating increased adoption and utilization in the foreseeable future—it brings with it a host of complications that warrant attention. Wu Highlights Potential Risks In The GENIUS Act Wu’s analysis emphasizes that the GENIUS Act has led to heightened global demand for US dollars and Treasury securities, which, while bolstering the dollar’s international standing, has also inadvertently benefited the Trump family and associates linked to the crypto industry. However, this development has opened new challenges for the oversight of dollar flows globally and raises concerns about the stability of the traditional financial system in the United States. A notable concern is how the trading of crypto assets enabled by USD stablecoins has evolved into a complex and less observable method for the US to extract wealth worldwide. Wu asserts that this mechanism poses significant threats to the monetary sovereignty and financial security of other nations. The GENIUS Act outlines reserve asset categories like bank deposits, short-term Treasuries, and repo agreements. However, the fluctuating values of these assets can lead to potential insufficiencies in reserves, particularly if Treasury prices decline. How Stablecoin Laws May Undermine The Industry’s Foundations Wu also explained that addressing the challenges of fiat stablecoins, lawmakers are likely to instigate regulations affecting all crypto assets, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Real-World Assets (RWAs), since these assets rely heavily on stablecoins. Currently, licensed financial institutions cannot directly engage in trading, clearing, or custody of crypto assets due to the lack of legal recognition, leaving these opportunities to unregulated private firms. This scenario has reportedly led to higher profits for unregulated actors while increasing pressure on banks and the broader financial ecosystem. Consequently, this dynamic has prompted government authorities to hasten stablecoin regulation. Once crypto assets receive full legal recognition, banks are expected to step into the market completely. This shift would enable banks and payment institutions to tokenize deposits, allowing them to directly link deposit tokens with traditional financial elements. The overall trend in the US indicates a move toward a system where heavily regulated banks establish stability. This shift would reportedly facilitate the principle of “same business, same regulation,” leading to diminished risks for the monetary and financial structure. However, this transformation through stablecoin legislation may threaten the very foundation of the stablecoin industry itself. Wu concludes that in this context, it would be illogical for other nations to replicate the aggressive push for stablecoin development that the US has adopted.

In a recent post, he noted that Japan and South Korea are reportedly discussing potential collaboration on blockchain-related initiatives. Although details have not yet been officially disclosed, Kanzaki stated that progress in these discussions may have implications for XRP adoption across the region. Early Signals of Japan–South Korea Blockchain Coordination Kanzaki referenced growing cooperation between both countries in the digital asset sector. Japan and South Korea represent two of the largest technology and finance hubs in Asia, and conversations about shared blockchain frameworks suggest interest beyond experimentation. If formal structures are introduced, they could support payment systems, remittance infrastructure, and enterprise blockchain deployment, areas where Ripple technology is already active. 日本と韓国はブロックチェーンインフラの共同開発に着手しています。 これらの協議は現在非公開で行われていますが、その影響は非常に大きいものとなるでしょう。 XRP保有者は、今後の動向に細心の注意を払うべきです。これはリップルにとって大きな転機となるでしょう。 — Yuto (@yutokanzakireal) December 25, 2025 Regulatory Updates Could Strengthen Ripple’s Position in Japan A separate update highlighted by Kanzaki on December 2 indicated that Japan is preparing to introduce regulations that would allow Ripple Prime and Ripple Custody to operate within the country’s established digital asset compliance system. Clear guidance of this nature would make it easier for regulated financial institutions to integrate Ripple-based services, improving conditions for future institutional participation. These policy signals follow Ripple’s earlier strategic investment in both markets. In mid-2024, Ripple allocated a significant portion of its long-term one-billion-XRP program to the XRPL Japan and Korea Fund . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Funding was directed toward expanding major partnerships, supporting new projects on the XRP Ledger, providing investment to startups, and sponsoring developer and education initiatives. Ripple stated that the commitment could reach tens of millions of dollars, reflecting its interest in deepening regional adoption. Expanding Validator Activity in East Asia Growth is also visible at the network level. In South Korea, Infinite Block became an official validator, enabling corporate-grade XRP services under regulatory oversight. Meanwhile, Japan-based SBI VC Trade joined the validator ecosystem as well, reinforcing its position as one of Ripple’s strongest partners in Asia . Wider validator participation enhances resilience and institutional readiness across the XRP Ledger, which is important for markets that operate under strict compliance rules. Kanzaki believes the combination of government-level talks, upcoming regulatory clarification, Ripple’s regional investment program, and the increase in XRPL validator activity points to a meaningful shift in market readiness within Asia. For this reason, he suggests that XRP holders monitor developments closely, particularly as Japan and South Korea evaluate cooperative blockchain pathways. If progress continues, he argues that Ripple could secure a stronger role in future financial infrastructure discussions across the region.
