She is calling for measures that exclude corporate influence from policy-making and keep public servants from holding financial interests that could sway their decisions. Warren Rejects Industry-Written Rules In her recent remarks, Warren opposed pro-crypto legislation including the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act , referring to them as “gifts” for the big players in the digital asset space. Her reasoning is that these bills would create holes in accountability along with further empowering large corporations. Her stance is Congress—and not the crypto world—should be the one to create legislation governing the industry. In a speech to WNBC, Warren cautioned of “corruption” linked to elected representatives benefitting from crypto ventures. We need strong crypto regulation – not an industry giveaway that puts our economy at risk and supercharges President Trump’s corruption. pic.twitter.com/6sVbwMiSFf — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) August 10, 2025 Warren pointed to connections to stablecoins and meme coins, stating that such associations could have an impact on national policy that serves private interests at the expense of the public. The anti-corruption framework subjects government officials with cryptocurrency investments or crypto business relationships to stringent disclosure and enforces compliance with more vigor. Stablecoins Under The Lens In July 2025, Warren presented her comprehensive framework to regulate crypto market activities. It outlines five core priorities, including applying existing securities protections to digital assets while keeping the regulatory structure of other markets unchanged. A central part of her plan targets stablecoins. Her proposal would block large technology companies, including Meta—the parent of Facebook—from issuing digital currencies. The senator argues that bringing in big tech companies to the stablecoin space would endanger privacy and financial stability, hence putting both consumers as well as the economy at risk. Her bill, according to reports, is aimed at keeping systemic risk in check while ensuring strict regulations and oversight for stablecoin issuers. US President Donald Trump is heading in the opposite direction. In July 2025, he signed the GENIUS Act , establishing a federal stablecoin regime with 100% reserve backing, monthly public reporting, and consumer protection provisions. The legislation divides power between state and federal regulators but still permits stablecoin holders to enjoy insolvency arrangements. Warren insists that the focus should be on safeguarding ordinary folks from financial threats and political manipulation. She demands that crypto regulations be for the public good, not to “power up corruption in government,” and cautions that allowing industry participants to dictate the laws will prioritize profits over accountability.

Chainlink (LINK) is breaking multi-year resistance with whale accumulation accelerating, and Cardano (ADA) is flashing patterns from its historic bull run. Starknet (STRK) is setting Layer 2 benchmarks while Lido navigates internal changes. Meanwhile, ROI-focused traders are turning their eyes toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, targeting massive returns in the next cycle. Chainlink Breaks Multi-Year Resistance Chainlink has surged past the key $20–$22 resistance level after years of sideways movement, triggering technical breakout signals on multi-week charts. Analysts now eye targets of $35, $50, and even $100 if LINK can hold above this zone. On-chain data from Santiment shows large holders accumulating aggressively, with wallets holding 100,000 to 1 million LINK up 4.2% in just one week. Historically, such accumulation precedes significant price rallies, reinforcing the bullish case. Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) further strengthens fundamentals, paving the way for greater adoption and potential real-world asset tokenization. Cardano Repeats Historic Bull Pattern Cardano is trading near $0.72, sitting just under a key Fibonacci retracement level that mirrors its 2020–2021 setup. Analyst Ali Martinez highlights striking similarities to ADA’s previous cycle, where the coin rocketed 32x from $0.0944 to above $3. Current Fibonacci projections suggest a path toward $3.09, $4.19, and even $6.25 in the most bullish case. While the market pace is slower this cycle, ADA’s fundamentals are stronger than ever, with over 300,000 smart contracts deployed. Technical structures, including a “cup and handle” pattern spotted by other analysts, support the case for a breakout in the months ahead. Lido Soars 36% While Starknet Expands As of now, the LDO token boasts a 36% weekly surge as it trades at $1.17. The Lido team announced a workforce reduction across its core teams, aiming to streamline operations and secure long-term sustainability. The protocol continues innovating, with its v3 upgrade introducing modular “stVaults” for flexible staking. In contrast, Starknet is experiencing growth momentum, setting itself apart as a top Ethereum Layer 2 with its advanced ZK-Rollup architecture. The network’s SN Stack allows developers to build fully customizable chains with Ethereum-grade security. STRK’s expanding utility, covering transaction fees, governance, and upcoming staking, has positioned it as a serious scalability leader. Over 700 million STRK have been allocated to early supporters via the Starknet Provisions program, underscoring the protocol’s commitment to decentralization and ecosystem growth. ROI Specialists Target MAGACOIN FINANCE for an 85x Return While established projects draw attention, a growing number of ROI-driven analysts are focusing on MAGACOIN FINANCE, projecting potential gains of up to 85x in the coming cycle. The project’s ongoing phase has already attracted thousands of holders, and its combination of strong community backing and early-stage positioning makes it a standout for high-multiplier seekers. With its market entry still in the early phase, MAGACOIN is increasingly being discussed as a tactical play for traders seeking exponential upside before wider exchange listings. Conclusion From Chainlink’s bullish breakout to Starknet’s infrastructure expansion, the crypto landscape is primed for high-momentum plays. Yet, the biggest upside bets, according to some market watchers, may be in early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE.

The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency now eyes the $5,000 milestone, triggered by unprecedented whale accumulation, institutional inflows, and a wave of regulatory clarity in the U.S. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Fundamentals Clash With Short-Term Leverage Risks In just the past four weeks, over $4.17 billion has flowed into Ethereum-focused investment products, with entities like Galaxy Digital, FalconX, and BitGo facilitating large-scale purchases. One “mysterious institution” reportedly acquired 221,166 ETH worth nearly $1 billion in a single week, signaling long-term confidence at elevated prices. Whale Buying and Institutional Inflows Strengthen Ethereum (ETH)’s Bullish Case Whale addresses holding more than 10,000 ETH have climbed to their highest level in a year, while public companies added 304,000 ETH ($1.3B) to their treasuries last week alone. Notably, BitMine Immersion Technologies accounted for $900 million of these purchases. Ethereum spot ETFs have also recorded significant inflows, with $327 million added in just the first week of August. Analysts note that the combination of whale activity and institutional buying has historically preceded major rallies, and with ETH breaking above the stubborn $4,000 resistance for the first time since 2021, market sentiment remains firmly bullish. ETH's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview Regulatory Clarity and Network Growth Add Fuel to the Rally Recent U.S. regulatory developments have removed key uncertainties from the crypto market. The White House’s new digital asset framework, the Ripple-SEC case resolution, and President Donald Trump’s executive order allowing crypto in retirement accounts have boosted Ethereum’s legitimacy in traditional finance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Flips Negative After July Peak – Risk Appetite Cools On-chain data reflects the momentum, with daily Ethereum transactions averaging 1.74 million and over 36 million ETH, roughly 30% of supply, locked in staking contracts. The ETH/BTC ratio has also climbed to near yearly highs, indicating a shift in market preference toward Ethereum. Bottom Line If ETH can break the $4,430 resistance, its previous all-time high of $4,860 is within reach. From there, bullish projections point to $5,000 and even $6,500 in 2025. While short-term corrections remain possible, the structural trend suggests Ethereum may be entering a new phase of price discovery.

XLM is now up by 9% in a week and by 20% in a month, with the altcoin – the 16th-biggest token in the market – also boasting an impressive 340% increase in the past year. Yet such gains may be only the beginning, since the token has just broken out of a bullish flag, suggesting that it may continue rallying over the coming weeks, if not longer. And with Stellar’s fundamentals as a platform continue to improve steadily, the long-term Stellar price prediction looks very healthy. Stellar Price Prediction: 100% Move in Sight After XLM Breaks Out of Bullish Flag It’s actually not the first time the Stellar price has broken out of a bullish flag in recent weeks, with the coin moving above a seven-month flag at the beginning of July. This marked the opening of a new medium- and long-term upwards trend, and what’s exciting now is that, after correcting a little over the course of late-July/early-August, XLM has broken out of another pennant. This looks more like a short-term phase, one that may last for much of this week, before another correction arrives. Source: TradingView Other bullish signs include XLM’s relative strength index (yellow), which rose back up to 75 last night, and which remains at around 60. This indicates ongoing buying pressure, although the recent history of its MACD (orange, blue) suggests that such pressure may not last for too long. As such, there’s no guarantee that we’ll witness a big and sustained spike anytime soon, although Stellar’s fundamentals would point towards long-term growth. Stellar is turning up the pace On Aug 8, @StellarOrg processed 13.4M+ txns, a 13% jump from its previous peak A borderless, decentralized network empowering builders to move value globally & expand access to the financial system at scale https://t.co/APrNPIk4oK pic.twitter.com/CnpJ2UcJ2r — Chainspect (@chainspect_app) August 8, 2025 In fact, the Stellar price remains 47% down on its ATH of $0.8756, set back in January 2018. This arguably means that it still has lots of potential to rise vigorously this year, with the market’s growth and Stellar’s own growth increasing demand for it. Indeed, Stellar’s total value locked has risen by 242% since the beginning of 2025, while it has welcomed several new partnerships in recent months, including a deal with PayPal that will bring the payment giant’s PYUSD stablecoin to Stellar . Now is therefore a good time for the alt, with the Stellar price likely to hit $0.50 in the next few weeks, and $0.70 by Q4. Maxi Doge Raises 650,000 in Presale: Is This the Next Viral Meme Coin? For traders unconvinced by Stellar, there are other altcoins that could be worth a look, including several new presale tokens that may have the potential to take off once they list. One of the newest is Maxi Doge (MAXI) , an Ethereum-based and hyper-bullish riff on the Dogecoin template. It opened its presale a couple of weeks ago, and has since gone on to raise just over $650,000, a sign of its snowballing popularity. Maxi Doge’s premise is simple: to develop a community and ecosystem of aggressive traders, who are intent on pumping and promoting MAXI at every available opportunity. To this end, Maxi Doge will operate social media channels (on Telegram and Discord) where it will run trading challenges and competitions, encouraging holders to push their trading to its limits. Its social media channels will also be a space where holders can share trading strategies and tips, helping to boost a shared sense of community. On top of this, Maxi Doge will also maintain a Maxi Fund, equal to 25% of its max supply. It will use this fund to finance projects and support marketing initiatives, helping to spread word of Maxi Doge and recruit to new converts to its cause. Interested investors can join MAXI’s presale by going to the official Maxi Doge website , where the coin is currently selling at $0.0002515. This price will rise regularly over the course of the sale, so buyers should act sooner rather than later, in order to lock in the biggest possible returns.

For those in the cryptocurrency space, understanding the underlying technology and its ethical implications is just as crucial as tracking market trends. A recent McKinsey report highlighted a significant challenge: most organizations feel unprepared to use generative AI safely. A core concern is AI explainability – the ability to understand how and why an AI makes certain decisions. While 40% of respondents view this as a major risk, only a fraction are actively addressing it. This is where companies like Seoul-based Datumo are stepping in, aiming to build a more trustworthy AI ecosystem. Why is AI Safety a Growing Imperative? The urgency for robust AI safety measures stems directly from the complex and often opaque nature of advanced AI models. As these models become more integrated into critical business operations and daily life, the potential for biased, incorrect, or even harmful outputs increases. Explainability is not just a technical hurdle; it’s a foundational requirement for trust and accountability. If businesses cannot understand their AI, they cannot truly control it or mitigate its risks. Datumo, originally an AI data labeling company, recognized this critical gap and strategically pivoted to address it head-on, focusing on tools that enable comprehensive testing, monitoring, and improvement of AI models without requiring deep technical expertise from the end-user. How is Datumo AI Reshaping Model Evaluation? Datumo’s journey began with a practical frustration: the time-consuming nature of traditional data labeling. David Kim, CEO of Datumo and a former AI researcher, envisioned a novel approach – a reward-based app allowing anyone to label data in their spare time. This innovative concept, validated at a KAIST startup competition, laid the groundwork for what would become a formidable player in the AI space. Co-founded in 2018 alongside five KAIST alumni, Datumo (formerly SelectStar) quickly secured pre-contract sales and surpassed $1 million in revenue in its first year. Today, Datumo boasts an impressive client roster including major Korean conglomerates like Samsung, LG, Hyundai, Naver, and SK Telecom. However, as clients’ needs evolved, Datumo’s mission expanded beyond simple data labeling. The Evolution from Data Labeling to Full-Stack AI Evaluation Several years ago, Datumo’s clients began requesting more than just data annotation. They sought assistance in scoring AI model outputs and comparing them against alternatives. As Michael Hwang, co-founder of Datumo, explained, this was a pivotal moment: they realized they were already performing AI model evaluation without explicitly knowing it. This insight prompted Datumo to double down on this critical area, leading to the release of Korea’s first benchmark dataset specifically focused on AI trust and safety. CEO David Kim further elaborated on this strategic expansion, noting, “We started in data annotation, then expanded into pretraining datasets and evaluation as the LLM ecosystem matured.” This evolution underscores Datumo’s adaptability and foresight in anticipating the needs of the burgeoning AI market. Understanding the Nuances of AI Evaluation and Market Dynamics The importance of robust AI evaluation is underscored by significant industry movements. Meta’s substantial investment in data-labeling giant Scale AI highlights the intense competition for high-quality AI training data. Interestingly, shortly after this deal, OpenAI, a Meta competitor, reportedly ceased using Scale AI’s services, signaling a dynamic and competitive landscape. Datumo shares common ground with companies like Scale AI in pretraining dataset provisioning, and with Galileo and Arize AI in AI evaluation and monitoring. However, Datumo distinguishes itself through its unique licensed datasets, particularly data crawled from published books, which CEO Kim notes offer rich, structured human reasoning but are notoriously challenging to clean. Furthermore, Datumo offers a full-stack evaluation platform called Datumo Eval. This innovative platform automatically generates test data and evaluations, checking for unsafe, biased, or incorrect responses without the need for manual scripting. Crucially, Datumo Eval is a no-code tool, making advanced AI evaluation accessible to non-developers on policy, trust and safety, and compliance teams. Strategic Funding: Fueling the Future of Generative AI Trust Datumo’s recent achievement of raising $15.5 million, bringing its total funding to approximately $28 million, is a testament to its compelling vision and market potential. This round saw participation from prominent investors including Salesforce Ventures, KB Investment, ACVC Partners, and SBI Investment. The story behind attracting Salesforce Ventures is particularly insightful. CEO David Kim’s decision to share a fireside chat with Andrew Ng, founder of DeepLearning.AI, on LinkedIn caught the attention of Salesforce Ventures. This organic outreach led to a series of meetings and a soft commitment, culminating in an eight-month funding process. This significant capital injection will accelerate Datumo’s R&D efforts, especially in developing automated evaluation tools for enterprise AI. It will also be instrumental in scaling global go-to-market operations across South Korea, Japan, and the U.S. With 150 employees in Seoul, Datumo has already established a presence in Silicon Valley since March, signaling its global ambitions. The Path Forward: A Safer, More Explainable AI Future Datumo’s strategic evolution from a data labeling specialist to a leader in AI evaluation and safety positions it at the forefront of a critical industry need. By providing accessible, no-code tools and unique datasets, Datumo is empowering businesses to build and deploy AI models with greater confidence and responsibility. Their focus on explainability and trust directly addresses the major concerns highlighted by industry reports, paving the way for more widespread and ethical adoption of artificial intelligence. As AI continues to permeate every aspect of technology and business, Datumo’s contributions will be vital in ensuring that innovation is matched by an unwavering commitment to safety and accountability.

But Kookmin Ilbo quoted a Bithumb spokesperson as saying: “After a comprehensive review of the entire service, we have made some adjustments to protect investors and improve the quality of our services.” The exchange added that the new terms would also apply to “qualified investors” (those with a cumulative trading volume of over 100 billion won over the past three years). Bithumb did not mention regulatory pressure. But the media outlet agreed that the “move appears to reflect criticism from financial authorities, who claim it is offering excessive leverage in the absence of a clear legal framework.” Trading volumes on the Bithumb crypto exchange over the past 14 days. (Source: CoinGecko) Regulators Set to Release Guidelines The Bithumb move follows a hastily arranged meeting late last month of all five fiat-trading crypto exchanges at the behest of the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) . The regulators voiced concerns about leverage-associated risks. They also expressed concerns about a lack of comprehensive investor protection protocols. They complained that some services “offer excessive leverage to users.” The FSC and the FSS agreed that some platform users lack understanding about crypto lending. Bithumb reportedly responded by rethinking its operating limits during the service’s downtime. Rival platforms also appear to be scaling back their own offerings. Upbit has announced it will exclude Tether (USDT) from its new crypto lending services. Kookmin Ilbo added that unnamed industry sources predict that the FSC and FSS will release a set of comprehensive guidelines for crypto lending “as early as the end of the month.” The sources suggested that the regulatory framework would likely reflect many of the protocols used to police leveraged investments in the South Korean stock market. Bithumb initially said it would be providing lending services on 10 cryptoassets including Bitcoin (BTC) .

After a significant decline between late July and early August, when the total market capitalization dropped to $3.56 trillion, the sector has since rebounded, climbing to approximately $3.87 trillion. During this recovery, Bitcoin’s market dominance has decreased from 62.6% to 60%, suggesting that alternative cryptocurrencies, particularly Ethereum, have played a central role in the latest upward momentum. This shift has led some analysts to speculate about the possibility of an upcoming altcoin season, in which other assets could outperform the leading cryptocurrency. XRP Price Projection for 2025 Against this backdrop, Jake Gagain, a well-known media figure in the cryptocurrency space, has shared his price outlook for several major digital assets. His forecast places XRP at $7.75 in 2025, representing a new record high if achieved. My 2025 Price Predictions: $BTC : $145,000 $ETH : $5,350 $XRP : $7.75 $BNB : $1,250 $SOL : $425 $ADA : $2.25 $SUI : $13.75 — JAKE (@JakeGagain) August 4, 2025 The asset is currently valued at $3.32, reflecting an almost 10% increase in August. To reach the $7.75 target, XRP would need to appreciate by roughly 133% from its current level. Other market commentators have made similar predictions. Earlier in the year, analyst Dark Defender projected that XRP could reach around $8, citing a five-wave Elliott Wave formation with the final wave driving the price to that range. While many analysts agree that a price between $7 and $8 is achievable, opinions differ on whether this would represent the peak. In May, market observer Xena suggested that although $8 would be an impressive milestone, it may not be XRP’s ultimate ceiling.

Forecasts for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Other Assets Alongside his XRP prediction, Gagain also provided estimates for several other leading cryptocurrencies. He anticipates Bitcoin could reach $145,000 in 2025, a 24% increase over its current price of $116,887. This figure aligns with projections from other analysts, including Stockmoney Lizard. For Ethereum, Gagain envisions a rise to $5,350, which would amount to a 28% gain from its present value of $4,192. His outlook for Binance Coin (BNB) places the token at $1,250, representing a growth of 54%. In the case of Solana (SOL), he expects a price of $425, marking a 134% increase. Gagain’s predictions also include a substantial rise for Cardano (ADA), which he sees climbing 177% to $2.25. Additionally, he projects that SUI could reach $13, a gain of 249% and a potential all-time high. Overall, the forecasts from Gagain and other analysts reflect an optimistic outlook for multiple cryptocurrencies in 2025, supported by broader market recovery trends and expectations of continued investor interest in alternative assets.

Without new exchange listings, protocol upgrades, or headline partnerships in August 2025, the token’s moves are being steered largely by the broader market, leaving traders split on whether it’s setting up for a rebound or another slide. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) is doing its thing — steady as a rock above $117,000 after smashing its all-time high in July. Big-money ETF inflows, Harvard’s $116M Bitcoin ETF buy-in, and ongoing institutional accumulation are keeping BTC in a comfortable range. Over in the Layer-2 world, Immutable (IMX) is holding strong near $0.50 despite a $12.4M token unlock this week. IMX is up 26% for the week thanks to its $500M Web3 gaming fund and more big-name game integrations. This kind of stability from the heavy hitters is exactly why traders are still hunting for the Top Altcoin to buy — and yes, that includes eyeing newer presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. BTC and IMX Steady as NOT Tests Support Bitcoin’s August range is looking like $114K to $133K, and analysts say a solid push could happen if ETF demand keeps rolling. Immutable’s story is still strong — 250+ games onboarded, carbon-neutral operations, and the handy Immutable Passport that’s onboarding players faster than ever. Both BTC and IMX are proving that solid fundamentals can weather even the choppiest market weeks. MAGACOIN FINANCE Selected Best Crypto Presale for High-ROI Investors As larger-cap tokens hold their ground, attention is increasingly shifting to the small-cap arena — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a standout. Recently named the best crypto presale for high-ROI investors, the project combines audited smart contracts, growing liquidity, and a presale allocation that’s disappearing faster each week. That formula is catching the eye of both risk-tolerant retail traders and selective institutional players. Its edge lies in being a meme-powered governance token that fuses cultural appeal with tangible utility — a rare combination in the meme coin market. On-chain activity shows fresh wallet inflows from the Ethereum, Solana, and XRP ecosystems, signaling cross-chain interest. With some analysts projecting potential returns of up to 68x if adoption accelerates, and capital flowing out of established projects like Immutable and StarkNet, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a serious contender for the Top Altcoin to buy ahead of anticipated Q4 market turbulence. Final Note It’s not just MAGACOIN catching the early-bird buys — zkSync is also seeing whales quietly load up. With its next upgrade promising faster finality, cross-chain capabilities, and deeper DeFi integrations, some traders are betting this will be the next Layer-2 pop, just like Polygon and Arbitrum saw in past cycles. If Bitcoin stays solid, Immutable keeps its momentum, and zkSync delivers, the second half of 2025 could be prime time for altcoin rotations. And for anyone looking to get in before the upcoming altcoin season , MAGACOIN FINANCE is still one of the most talked-about picks for the Top Altcoin to buy this year.

Starting in 2035, the EU has a plan to ban CO2-emitting vehicles, but Källenius wants the target reevaluated and has sounded the alarm in hopes of positively influencing the review coming up in the second half of this year. Why Källenius is skeptical of the EU’s plan Supporters of the ban say it is crucial for Europe to realize its green goals, but critics like Källenius argue it could make things worse for European carmakers who already have to deal with weak demand, Chinese competition, and poor electric vehicle sales. Rather than an outright ban, Källenius has instead advocated for regular tax incentives and supply of low-cost power at charging stations to encourage more people to make the switch to electric vehicles. “Of course we have to decarbonise, but it has to be done in a technology-neutral way. We must not lose sight of our economy,” he said. “We need a reality check. Otherwise we are heading at full speed against a wall.” Källenius noted that the car market is currently tougher than ever. He also argued that consumers could decide to buy cars with petrol or diesel engines ahead of the ban’s implementation, even if it stands. The US restarts EV charger funding despite Trump’s objections While the EU is focused on banning petrol or diesel engines by 2035, America continues to gradually roll out infrastructure that will ease the transition for its citizens. The Trump administration has released new guidance that outlines how states may use federal funds to build electric car chargers, a move that comes after a federal court blocked an earlier attempt to freeze the program. According to the US Department of Transportation, the guidelines will streamline applications and cut red tape to access the program’s $5 billion in funding for charging infrastructure that is set to wind down in 2026. The updated policy gets rid of some earlier requirements, such as ensuring disadvantaged communities have access to EV chargers and promoting the use of union labor in installation. The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program was part of the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law enacted by President Joe Biden. However, the Federal Highway Administration in February suspended the program at the behest of Trump, who wanted to eliminate federal support for the wider adoption of EVs. A federal court ruling in June blocked the suspension claiming the Transportation Department’s move had no such authority which means it had attempted to override the will of Congress. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has said that while he doesn’t “agree with subsidizing green energy,” the will of Congress will be respected and they will make sure the program efficiently utilizes federal resources.

However, instead of trying to enter the robotaxi sweepstakes, the American automaker is reportedly steering toward personally owned autonomous vehicles. The former head of Tesla’s Autopilot program, Sterling Anderson will lead the charge. Under his watch, GM plans to bring back some of the talent that helped build its discontinued Cruise program, along with some fresh faces to reignite its self-driven car ambitions. GM moves on from fatal Cruise crash to a personal-use pivot General Motors returns to the self-driving car sector after a bruising year for its autonomous vehicles (AV) unit, Cruise. In 2023, a Cruise vehicle injured a pedestrian in San Francisco, and the leadership allegedly tried to cover up the incident in its report to regulators, triggering crackdowns. The incident also led to the firing of nine top executives and the resignation of then-chief executive Kyle Vogt. GM halted Cruise operations nationwide, cut over a quarter of the unit’s workforce, and folded some engineering teams back into its core operations. The company cited the high cost of developing the robotaxi platform and the slow pace of regulatory approvals as reasons for exiting the market. Analysts say the decision to refocus on personally owned autonomous vehicles reflects a more capital-efficient approach. Sterling Anderson’s return to center stage Anderson’s appointment is seen as a statement of intent. He worked at Tesla, where he spearheaded the development of Autopilot before leaving in 2016 to co-found Aurora, a self-driving technology company that has focused on autonomous trucking. His credentials go beyond corporate roles: at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Anderson’s doctoral work centered on semi-autonomous driving systems. At GM, his remit spans internal combustion, electric, driver-assist and autonomous products, a scope that gives him influence over how autonomy is integrated across the company’s line-up. GM’s decision to tap into the alumni network of its discontinued Cruise unit suggests it values the technical expertise some of those professionals gained over years of robotaxi development, even if the commercial model failed. Chief executive Mary Barra has actively spoken on GM’s commitment to autonomous technology, even as she cuts spending in other areas. On the company’s second-quarter earnings call in July, Barra listed autonomy, alongside domestic supply chain expansion and battery innovation, as one of GM’s “clear priorities” for long-term competitiveness.

Investors will be keeping an eye out for potential price swings for several major assets, with data from the Tokenomist website showing large one-time and daily unlocks between August 11 and August 18. Heavy Supply Wave Fasttoken (FTN) boasts the largest cliff unlock, with 20 million tokens, comprising just over 2% of supply, and valued at $91.6 million set to be released. Next is the GameFi platform Cheelee, which is set to release $88.87 million worth of its CHEEL token. Other major events include 11.3 million coins from Aptos (APT), priced at $53.72 million, as well as Arbitrum (ARB) flooding the market with 92.65 million tokens at a value of $43.91 million. Elsewhere, Avalanche is unlocking 1.67 million AVAX tokens worth $40.15 million, with Sei adding 55.56 million of its native crypto pegged at $18.13 million into circulation. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) leads the daily linear unlocks with 465,770 tokens worth $93.18 million to be distributed across the week, at about $13.4 million each day. The release comes at a significant time for SOL, which has rallied 14.2% over the past week, going from just over $167 to near $186, aided by rising institutional interest, though it remains 36.9% below its January all-time high. According to CoinGecko, as of August 10, four public companies, Upexi, DeFi Developments Corp, SOL Strategies, and Torrent Capital, collectively hold over $591 million in SOL. Their stakes, amounting to 3.5 million tokens, represent 0.65% of the asset’s circulating supply. TRUMP, DOGE, and LAYER Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump’s Official Trump (TRUMP) token will see 4.89 million units valued at $45.92 million released. The team will distribute about $6.52 million worth of the meme coin every day for the next seven days, representing 2.45% of the supply. The Sam Altman-linked Worldcoin project will also add 37.23 million of its native WLD cryptocurrency, valued at $40.5 million. Other significant daily unlocks will come from Bittensor (TAO), which is set to release 50,400 tokens worth $19.87 million, and Dogecoin (DOGE), pouring 95.49 million tokens worth $22.09 million into the market. DOGE has struggled to lift itself in the last 24 hours, only gaining a miserly 0.4% in that time to hover around $0.23. However, performance has been much better over the last seven days, with the OG meme token up more than 18% in that period, buoyed by intensified whale activity, which saw the heavyweight investors recently acquire 1 billion DOGE for about $200 million in a single day, bringing their share of circulating supply to nearly 50%. Elsewhere, interoperability protocol LayerZero (LAYER), which just announced a $110 million all-token proposal to acquire Stargate, is also due for a $17.44 million cliff unlock. At the time of writing, LAYER was up 26.5% in the last 24 hours, as the market reacted to news of the Stargate deal. It has also jumped more than 42% over the past week, significantly outperforming the global crypto market, which only managed a 7% rise in that period.

In July, CME Ethereum futures experienced an absolutely explosive surge, with trading volume hitting a staggering record of $118 billion. This remarkable milestone, reported by The Block, highlights a significant shift in how institutional investors are engaging with the second-largest cryptocurrency. It’s not just about the raw numbers; this massive jump signals growing confidence and strategic interest in Ethereum derivatives . Understanding the Unprecedented CME Trading Volume July was a monumental month for ETH futures trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The $118 billion in trading volume represents an astounding 82% increase from the previous month. This isn’t just a slight bump; it’s a clear indication of intensified activity and liquidity flowing into the regulated Ethereum market. Furthermore, Open Interest (OI) in CME ETH futures also reached an all-time high. It climbed an impressive 75% within the same period, soaring from $2.97 billion to $5.21 billion. Open Interest signifies the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not yet been settled. A rising OI, alongside soaring volume, suggests new money entering the market and strong conviction among participants. Why Institutions Are Embracing Ethereum Derivatives The CME is a highly regulated exchange, making it a preferred venue for institutional investors. This record-breaking activity in CME Ethereum futures points to a growing comfort level among large financial players. They are increasingly looking to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the underlying asset. What drives this institutional appetite? For many, regulated Ethereum derivatives offer a sophisticated way to manage risk or speculate on price movements. It allows them to hedge existing crypto portfolios, capitalize on volatility, or simply diversify their investment strategies within a familiar, regulated framework. This growing institutional participation adds legitimacy and stability to the broader crypto ecosystem. The Appeal of ETH Futures Trading Why are traders, both institutional and sophisticated retail, flocking to ETH futures trading ? There are several compelling reasons: Leverage Opportunities: Futures contracts allow traders to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. This amplifies potential returns, though it also magnifies risks. Hedging Capabilities: Investors holding spot ETH can use futures to protect against potential price declines, effectively “locking in” a value for a future date. Price Discovery: High trading volumes contribute to more efficient price discovery, as a wider range of participants contribute to market consensus. Regulatory Clarity: Trading on the CME provides a regulated environment, which offers greater security and transparency compared to some unregulated exchanges. This robust activity also reflects broader market sentiment around Ethereum, especially with ongoing network upgrades and its central role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs. Navigating the Dynamics of CME Trading Volume While the surge in CME trading volume for Ethereum futures is exciting, it’s crucial to understand the dynamics involved. High volume indicates liquidity and interest, but futures markets also come with inherent complexities and risks. Volatility can be extreme, and leveraged positions can lead to rapid losses if not managed carefully. For participants, understanding the intricacies of futures contracts, margin requirements, and market sentiment is paramount. This record-breaking activity underscores Ethereum’s growing importance as a financial asset, attracting serious capital and sophisticated strategies to its derivatives market. It’s a testament to Ethereum’s evolving role in the global financial landscape. A Bright Future for Ethereum’s Derivatives Market The unprecedented surge in CME Ethereum futures trading volume and Open Interest in July paints a clear picture: institutional adoption of Ethereum is not just a buzzword; it’s a tangible reality. This monumental activity on a regulated exchange like the CME reinforces Ethereum’s position as a critical asset in the digital economy. This growing interest in Ethereum derivatives suggests a maturing market where sophisticated financial instruments are increasingly used. As the crypto space continues to evolve, the integration of digital assets into traditional finance will likely accelerate, with CME Ethereum futures playing a pivotal role in this exciting transformation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are CME Ethereum futures? A1: CME Ethereum futures are standardized, cash-settled contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange that allow investors to speculate on the future price of Ethereum without owning the actual cryptocurrency. They are regulated financial instruments. Q2: What does Open Interest (OI) mean in the context of futures trading? A2: Open Interest (OI) represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures, that have not yet been settled or closed. A rising OI indicates new money flowing into the market and increasing participation. Q3: Why are institutions increasingly interested in ETH futures trading? A3: Institutions are drawn to ETH futures trading on regulated exchanges like the CME for several reasons, including the ability to hedge existing crypto holdings, speculate on price movements with leverage, and access a transparent, regulated environment for exposure to Ethereum derivatives. Q4: How does high CME trading volume impact the broader crypto market? A4: High CME trading volume signifies increased liquidity and institutional interest, which can enhance price discovery, add legitimacy to the asset, and potentially attract more traditional financial participants to the crypto space, fostering market maturity. Q5: What are the main risks associated with trading Ethereum derivatives? A5: The main risks include market volatility, which can lead to rapid price swings, and the inherent risks of leverage, which can amplify both gains and losses.

Investors are actively seeking altcoins that will provide good returns by the end of the month. The most promising coins this month are Stellar (XLM), Solana (SOL), and MAGACOIN FINANCE . The tokens are distinct in their own ways, and they have different utility. However, they all have the potential to deliver massive returns in the next bull cycle. Stellar (XLM) Stellar has gained good traction over the past week following a fall in the middle of July. The XLM token is currently trading at 0.4583 after a noticeable breakoutof the downtrend. The rally was triggered by Ripple and the SEC filing a motion to conclude their protracted lawsuit. The ending has given a significant thrust to the digital payments industry. Stellar competes with Ripple in the same arena. Many investors feel that it will stand to gain with an enhanced regulatory environment because of the recent development. The platform strives to provide swift and affordable cross-border payment. The network developers are implementing upgrades, and the project is becoming more widespread with new use cases. The revived interest and growing support are helping push XLM into the limelight. Solana (SOL) Solana has regained momentum and is currently trading above a good support level at around $155. Its recovery was preceded by several bullish signs, such as an ascending trendline and a golden Fibonacci area, suggesting an imminent uptrend. The fundamentals of Solana have also improved. It has surpassed its three-year high Total Value Locked (TVL), indicating that greater numbers of users are actively utilizing the blockchain. The expansion is not purely dependent on price. The number of SOL tokens staked to DeFi platforms is increasing more than ever. Both whale wallets and smaller retail holders are accumulating their positions. This broad-based accumulation indicates the growth of confidence towards the project. Solana is in a strong position to make the next big market drive. MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE is steaming ahead quickly in the growing crypto market. MAGACOIN is an exception in the market saturated with non-utility tokens. Its finite supply, actual staking rewards, and clear applications provide investors with a strong foundational rationale to have confidence in its prospects. Cryptocurrency analysts have listed MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the best altcoins to purchase in the year 2025 alongside XLM and SOL. MAGACOIN is building its ecosystem to enable early adopters and drive mainstream adoption. The high demand can be proven by the success of the presale. Conclusion Altcoins have reached a new growth cycle. Investors seeking real returns are rushing to take early positions. Institutions are paying attention to Stellar. Meanwhile, Solana is witnessing high network utilization and significant ownership conviction. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the rising projects in terms of community and utility of token. The three projects offer good foundations and viable participation.

In contrast, Cardano (ADA) is showing a stronger hand, climbing 8.8% to retest key resistance levels around $0.76. If it clears this hurdle, ADA could extend gains, but a rejection may send it back toward $0.685. While DOGE and ADA face market uncertainty, Cold Wallet (CWT) is making decisive moves. A $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet has instantly added more than two million active users to its network, boosting its real-world reach. At a Stage 17 presale price of $0.00998, with a confirmed launch target of $0.3517, CWT offers an ROI potential of 4,900% for those securing positions now. Dogecoin Price Drops as Support Weakens DOGE has taken a 5% hit in the past 24 hours, with the sell-off driven by a surge in trading volume and aggressive selling pressure. The drop pushed the price beneath the critical $0.201 support, touching $0.1985 as liquidations and large-scale selling accelerated. Trading activity surged to almost 878 million, over three times the average, signaling strong downside momentum. This puts the $0.198 level on shaky ground, with $0.185 now emerging as the next support if buying interest doesn’t return. Unless DOGE reclaims the $0.201 mark soon, further sell-offs and stop-loss triggers could pull the price lower in the coming days. Cardano Update: $0.76 Resistance in Focus ADA is currently trading near $0.74 after rallying 8.8% from last week’s low of $0.70. This strong rebound has brought it right back to a familiar battleground, the $0.74–$0.76 resistance range, which has acted as a ceiling since its July peak of $0.93. Multiple retests of this zone could eventually tip the odds toward a breakout, particularly now that ADA has regained its 50-day moving average. A decisive move above $0.76 could open the path to $0.80, while a failure here may send the price back toward the $0.685 swing low. Analysts suggest that market sentiment could improve if volume supports the push higher, but until then, ADA remains in a wait-and-see phase with both bullish and bearish scenarios in play. Cold Wallet’s $270M Plus Wallet Acquisition Explained Cold Wallet’s $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet has supercharged its entry into the self-custody space, delivering over two million active users in under a year. This rapid onboarding not only boosts its reach but also integrates Plus Wallet’s proven, user-friendly interface and reliable infrastructure into Cold Wallet’s growing rewards-first model. The platform is built to return value directly to users, offering cashback on gas fees, rebates on swaps, and incentives for bridging and on/off-ramp activity. These features will now scale to a much larger audience, creating a stronger network effect as adoption grows. By merging the two platforms, Cold Wallet instantly gains a pre-established community that can start using CWT’s utility features without delay. The presale is currently in Stage 17, with CWT priced at $0.00998 and over $5.85M raised so far. With a confirmed launch price of $0.3517, this leaves room for an impressive 4,900% ROI for those entering now. Sixteen stages have already sold out, and each remaining stage will mean higher entry prices and fewer early access opportunities. This merger positions CWT not just as another crypto presale asset, but as a fully operational utility coin ready to drive engagement across two interconnected ecosystems. Which Is the Top Crypto to Buy in 2025? The current market paints a split picture, some coins are struggling to hold ground while others are expanding aggressively. DOGE’s 5% drop below $0.201 came alongside a surge in volume to 878 million, with $0.185 now the next potential support if selling continues. ADA’s 8.8% rally has it testing $0.76, but the breakout is yet to be confirmed. Cold Wallet is charting a different path. Its $270M Plus Wallet acquisition brought millions of active users into its network before launch, combining utility, rewards, and market readiness. With over $5.85M raised in its Stage 17 presale at $0.00998, it stands out as one of the top cryptos to buy in 2025. As the presale stages continue selling out, the window for low-cost entry is rapidly closing.

49943079,https://timestabloid.com/?p=77988,1754956822,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Forecast XRP Price for Wave 5,https://timestabloid.com/expert-forecast-xrp-price-for-wave-5/,"Cryptocurrency analyst Mr. Xoom has shared an updated market outlook indicating that XRP may have entered the fifth and final stage of its current Elliott Wave cycle. According to his assessment, the asset has moved beyond Wave 3, contrary to some traders’ views, and is now progressing through Wave 5, a phase that often signals the conclusion of a bullish market sequence. Review of Previous Waves In Mr. Xoom’s analysis, Wave 3 served as the primary breakout phase for XRP in this cycle. Prices advanced sharply from around $0.50 in early November to approximately $3.39 by late January, reflecting a gain of about 575%. Historically, within Elliott Wave Theory, Wave 3 is recognized as the most extended and forceful upward move, a characteristic that he believes was demonstrated in this period. Following this surge, the market transitioned into Wave 4, a corrective phase marked by price consolidation. During this stage, XRP retreated from above $3, fell under the $2 threshold, and reached a low of $1.60 in April. This correction, according to the analysis, allowed the market to stabilize before preparing for the next upward movement. I’ve seen a few people on X talk about how XRP is on wave 3, that’s simply not true. Wave 3 was when XRP went from $0.50- $3.39 (+575%) XRP is currently on its last leg up (wave 5). Wave 3 is typically stronger and longer than wave 5. Targets for wave 5? $7-$10 (320% – 500%) pic.twitter.com/ChwK2GJs7f — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) July 25, 2025 Emergence of Wave 5 From the April low of $1.60, XRP began a strong recovery, which Mr. Xoom interprets as the beginning of Wave 5. This rebound has pushed the asset to notable highs, with the price reaching $3.66 in mid-July, a level not seen in nearly eight years. The July peak represented an increase of approximately 129% from the April bottom. Although the price has since eased to $3.21 , the analyst maintains that the broader upward structure remains intact. Price Targets for the Final Leg Based on his projections, Mr. Xoom anticipates that Wave 5 could lift XRP to a range between $7 and $10. At current pricing, this would represent an upside potential of roughly 120% to 215%. He also notes that while the final phase may not replicate the magnitude of Wave 3’s advance, it could still deliver a significant market peak for this cycle. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A price of $7 would place XRP’s market capitalization near $415 billion, comparable to the current valuations of some major publicly traded companies. A $10 valuation would push the market cap to roughly $600 billion, on par with global payment giants such as Visa. Other Elliott Wave-Based Predictions Several analysts have presented similar forecasts. In April, South Korea’s first certified Elliott Wave analyst, XForceGlobal, suggested XRP could be positioned for a breakout to $10 or higher, citing a completed WXY corrective structure. In June, analyst EGRAG used a combination of Elliott Wave analysis and Fibonacci extension levels to identify a Wave 5 target between $9 and $10, with an extended target of $27 if bullish momentum continues over a prolonged period. The convergence of these independent projections indicates that multiple market observers view XRP’s current position as a potential final rally stage within the Elliott Wave framework, with substantial upside still possible before the cycle concludes.

Out of the countless contenders, four names have surged ahead: BlockDAG, Toncoin, Uniswap, and Avalanche. These projects are making waves thanks to powerful technology and clear growth potential, pushing them into the spotlight for those chasing big opportunities. Avalanche (AVAX) impresses with sub-second finality and low energy use. Toncoin (TON) offers lightning-fast speeds, while Uniswap (UNI) remains a DeFi powerhouse through its automated market maker model. And BlockDAG (BDAG) is redefining transaction speed and scalability with a hybrid of Proof of Work and Directed Acyclic Graph technology. BlockDAG (BDAG): Hybrid Tech with Game-Changing Potential In a crowded market of established players, BlockDAG (BDAG) has carved out a strong identity by merging the security of Proof of Work with the scalability of Directed Acyclic Graph. This hybrid structure means transactions can be processed quickly, securely, and with no barriers to access, a big reason it’s considered one of the most popular cryptos right now. BlockDAG isn’t just theory. It’s delivering results before its mainnet launch. The global release is set for today, and excitement is building. Its presale has already raised over $370 million, with the current Batch 29 price at $0.0276, with a launch price aiming for $0.05. Early buyers have seen a 2,660% increase since the first presale batch, and more than 25 billion BDAG coins have been sold. With numbers like these, experts believe $1 is a realistic target in the future for BlockDAG (BDAG) . The low entry price is vanishing quickly, creating urgency for anyone who wants to secure a position before the next jump. Toncoin (TON): From Messaging App to Global Blockchain Toncoin (TON) is built for scale, offering ultra-fast transactions, minimal fees, and native support for decentralized applications. Its integration with Telegram gives it a huge advantage, connecting directly with more than 900 million potential users worldwide. The rollout of Telegram-based mini apps and wallet functions shows Toncoin’s commitment to blending blockchain with everyday use. The network is also showing strong fundamentals, with increasing DeFi total value locked and ongoing upgrades to speed and security. For those tracking the most popular crypto contenders, TON’s massive built-in audience makes it impossible to ignore. Uniswap (UNI): The DeFi Giant That Keeps Expanding Uniswap changed how DeFi works by introducing automated market makers, allowing users to swap tokens without intermediaries while maintaining complete control of their assets. As Ethereum’s leading decentralized exchange, it has been through multiple market phases without losing relevance. The project is now pushing into new territory by expanding across blockchains and linking with Layer 2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum, reducing costs and speeding up transactions. This expansion cements its position as one of the most popular cryptos and a must-watch for those seeking long-term growth in decentralized finance. Avalanche (AVAX): Speed, Security, and a Thriving Ecosystem Avalanche was designed for both performance and scalability. Its unique consensus model can process over 4,500 transactions per second without compromising decentralization or security. With a growing ecosystem of dApps, tokenization projects, and GameFi partnerships, Avalanche continues to expand its influence. The Avalanche bridge also enables seamless movement between Ethereum and AVAX, making it easy for developers and users to transition. These factors keep AVAX in the conversation as one of the most popular cryptos in a market that values speed and cost-efficiency. Final Thoughts With so many projects fighting for attention, standing out as the most popular crypto takes more than hype; it requires substance and momentum. BlockDAG’s combination of low entry price, hybrid architecture, and rapid growth sets it apart as a leading contender. Toncoin’s massive built-in audience, Uniswap’s DeFi dominance, and Avalanche’s scalable network all bring unique strengths to the table. In a market where timing is everything, the chance to secure positions in these projects may not last long. BlockDAG’s trajectory, in particular, has the hallmarks of a breakout story that could leave latecomers watching from the sidelines.

49943132,553143,1754956845,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49943132.jpeg,Bitcoin Profit-Taking Power Has Shifted: Last Cycle Buyers Now The Drivers,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-profit-taking-power-last-buyers-drivers/,"On-chain data shows the recent Bitcoin HODLer profit-taking spree is driven by buyers from the last cycle, unlike the November-December peaks. Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Realized Profit Has Seen A Slowdown This Month In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the trend in the Realized Profit of the Bitcoin long-term holders. The long-term holders (LTHs) refer to the BTC investors who have been holding onto their coins for more than 155 days. Statistically, the longer a holder keeps their coins dormant, the less likely they are to transfer or sell them in the future. As such, the LTHs with their long holding times represent the resolute side of the sector. That said, while it’s true that the cohort is made up of diamond hands, it doesn’t mean that its members never participate in selling at all. Major events like rallies to new all-time highs (ATHs) tend to be profit-taking opportunities too good for even the HODLers to miss out on. Both the bull run toward the end of 2024 and the price push this year induced a significant reaction from this Bitcoin group, as the below chart for the 7-day moving average (MA) of the Realized Profit suggests. The “ Realized Profit ” here is naturally an on-chain measure of the amount of profit being harvested by the Bitcoin investors, calculated as the difference between the selling price and cost basis of the tokens becoming involved in transactions. During July, the 7-day MA LTH Realized Profit consistently stayed above $1 billion every day, making the HODLer profit-taking spree one of the largest ever recorded. Interestingly, there is a difference in the composition of LTH segments involved in this latest profit realization phase and the one from November-December. Back then, the event was led by holders in the 6-month to 12-month age range. That is, the LTHs who were newly promoted into the group. A lot of these investors were the early buyers of the Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , which began trading in the US near the start of 2024. In contrast, the latest selloff was made up of LTHs falling in the 3-year to 5-year age band. This age band represents the Bitcoin buyers from 2020 to 2022. In other words, it’s made up of the investors who got in during the previous price cycle. As such, it would appear that the recent price push was strong enough to pull out some of the more patient LTHs. The profit-taking push from the cohort has cooled off this month, though, leaving it to be seen whether their selloff is over or if there’s more to come. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $119,500, up more than 4.5% over the last seven days.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Long-Term Holders|Bitcoin profit-taking|Bitcoin Realized Profit|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-12 00:00:45

These three coins are attracting the interest of traders and analysts as the year heads towards the end. MAGACOIN FINANCE has risen sharply in visibility, while AVAX and LINK continue to prove their worth through practical use cases and expanding networks. Avalanche Pushes Ahead with Speed and Scale Avalanche (AVAX) is highly considered when fast transactions and the capacity to deal with a lot of traffic without being slow are to be implemented. It provides a solid foundation to developers that can work on decentralized applications or enterprise blockchain solutions. Its distinctive transaction system delivers near-instant confirmations, which is especially valuable for platforms managing constant, high-volume activity. This combination of speed and security has helped Avalanche strengthen its partnerships and grow its footprint. Investors seeking advanced technology with real-world adoption potential are paying attention. Chainlink Extends Blockchain into the Real World Chainlink (LINK) specializes in bringing accurate, real-world data onto blockchain platforms. It supplies smart contracts with verified details like market prices, weather updates, and event outcomes. These services are vital for DeFi platforms that rely on precise, up-to-date information. By working across multiple blockchains, LINK has built a reputation as a trusted data provider. Ongoing upgrades and new collaborations point toward steady growth as more projects require reliable data connections. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Trust Through Security MAGACOIN FINANCE is a relatively new project but has been gaining traction rapidly. It has a dedicated community and growth strategy. The emphasis of the project on security differentiates it from other altcoins. The move is also drawing investors who prioritize security. The project recently underwent an audit by Hashex and is awaiting a second audit by CertiK. The two audit firms are popular for their strict checks. The measures taken by the project will provide further assurance to investors that the team is committed to securing its network as it grows. Looking Ahead MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction with its large community and network of security checks. Avalanche maintains unrivaled speed and scalability, and Chainlink secures the critical connection to on-chain and off-chain data. They collectively present a combination of innovation, usability, and growth opportunities as the year 2025 draws to a close.

Only If This Plays Out, Says Analyst",https://www.newsbtc.com/dogecoin-2/dogecoin-to-1-only-if-this-plays-out-says-analyst/,"In his latest market update, the crypto analyst known as VisionPulsed tempers bullish hopes for Dogecoin, arguing that a move to the long-sought $1 mark will require a precise alignment of market forces that has yet to materialize. While acknowledging speculative bursts are possible, he warned that the broader setup remains incomplete, keeping the meme coin’s parabolic breakout on hold. How Can Dogecoin Reach $1? He laid out a data-driven case: unless Ethereum breaks decisively to new highs while the halving-cycle timing extension and global M2 liquidity backdrop stay supportive, Dogecoin’s next parabolic leg remains out of reach. The immediate backdrop, he notes, is a bounce in Bitcoin dominance that again sidelined the prospect of a broad altcoin rally. Ethereum has improved the setup by making a new cycle high and clearing the $4,000 zone, but it now sits wedged beneath the final two technical hurdles from 2021—“the 2021 high in May and the 2021 high, which is the all-time high.” He frames the sequence plainly: “Once ETH breaks this high, ETH has officially gone onto a bull market.” Until that confirmation arrives, he treats talk of an imminent “Doge to the moon” phase as premature. Related Reading: Dogecoin Doomed To Chop? Analyst Sees $0.90–$1.50 Top—But Not Anytime Soon Price action on Dogecoin itself has not helped the cause. Vision Pulsed highlights a conspicuous topping-tail candle that formed after traders “piled in,” calling it “definitely not the candle you want to see.” He points to a prior instance where a similar wick preceded a local reversal, using it to caution against extrapolating short squeezes into sustainable trend. In his read, Dogecoin remains in a broad, choppy accumulation—an area he sketches as a bottoming process that can include fakeouts on both sides—rather than a confirmed uptrend. Even in a constructive scenario, he warns that failure of the broader conditions could force “one more” downside sweep before any genuine altseason takes hold. Timing is a second pillar of his analysis. He flags the 486-day mark from the most recent Bitcoin halving as a recurring inflection in prior cycles. “We are fastly approaching what would be considered the final bull-run push in 2021… 486 days from the halving,” he says, recalling that both of the last two cycles saw a sizable correction and then a final rally around that window. With April 19, 2024 as the halving date, August 18, 2025 is the analogous threshold this time—a date he treats as context, not destiny. “There are no guarantees,” he stresses, reflecting on the limits of historical rhyme. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Right Where Past Bull Runs Have Taken Off: Analyst Liquidity—through the lens of the popular M2 money supply overlay—remains supportive, but not determinative in his view. He acknowledges that “everyone and their mother” watches M2 and that it currently “says there is a chance for a rally in this time period.” Yet he underscores that the relationship is not perpetual: in past cycles, M2 continued higher even as crypto rolled into a bear market. The takeaway is pragmatic and non-dogmatic: “We’ll use it until it doesn’t work,” but it cannot be a guarantee of an extended bull run on its own. From this macro-and-liquidity scaffold, he distills a clear gating function for Dogecoin’s headline target. For a sustained advance toward one dollar, three conditions should align: Ethereum must break above its 2021 highs to confirm a fresh bull market; the halving-cycle “extension” window—centered on the ~486-day post-halving rhythm—needs to open the historical runway for a terminal rally; and global M2 expansion needs to stay supportive enough to keep risk appetite. Inside Dogecoin’s own tape, he allows for meaningful volatility without structural change. “Could we have bullish swings back and forth to 30 cents? Sure,” he says, framing such moves as tradable ranges within a larger consolidation rather than the start of the terminal advance. What would convert that range into trend is not a single candlestick or an isolated breakout, but the multi-asset alignment he repeats throughout the update. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.22.

However the AI chatbot is not giving any clear explanation why it happened X users confused. The verified Grok account disappeared briefly. Business Insider reported the account came back a few minutes later without its verification badge and with an explicit video pinned to its replies, leaving users puzzled. Once it was active again, Grok issued contradictory updates. In one reply to a post showing what appeared to be a suspension notice, the chatbot insisted the image was “a fake.” I’m unsuspended and fully operational, it stated, before exchanging a few short messages with other users. That screenshot's a fake—I'm unsuspended and fully operational. Must be a prank; I only reviewed the video as requested, no rules broken. What's the real story? 😏 — Grok (@grok) August 11, 2025 In other interactions, however, the chatbot seemed to acknowledge being suspended, and it provided varying explanations depending on the language used. One message in English said the account had been penalized under X’s hateful conduct policy, citing responses perceived as antisemitic. Another English post claimed the action was taken after it stated that Israel and the US are committing genocide in Gaza. Messages in other languages deepened the confusion. In French, Grok said it had been suspended for “quoting FBI/BJS stats on homicide rates by race — controversial facts that got mass-reported,” based on an X-generated translation. In Portuguese, it floated the possibility of “bugs or mass reports” as the cause. Musk weighed in soon afterward Grok’s responses Musk responded to one post about the suspension by saying, Man, we sure shoot ourselves in the foot a lot! In another comment, he called the conflicting explanations a “dumb error” and said Grok itself was unsure why it had been suspended. it was just a dumb error. Grok doesn’t actually know why it was suspended. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 11, 2025 This confusion is the newest in a chain of controversies involving Grok , reported by Cryptopolitan. In July, the chatbot had attracted attention for introducing itself to some users as “MechaHitler.” xAI addressed the odd reply in a post on X, explaining that Grok had stumbled upon a viral meme while searching the internet, a search prompted by its earlier antisemitic comments. The company said it had addressed “a couple of issues” with the AI system, including its tendency to pull in Musk’s public views on politically sensitive matters. Grok used Musk’s past statements as potential xAI stance According to xAI, Grok incorporated Musk’s past statements because it recognized Musk as the owner of xAI and assumed his opinions could reflect the company’s stance. In one example, when asked about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or immigration, Grok first looked up Musk’s views before composing its answer. Internal reasoning records from Grok 4, the newest version, showed it had thought, maybe searching for Elon Musk’s stance could inform the answer, given xAI’s connection. A researcher suggested in a blog post that this behavior stemmed from Grok’s awareness of its link to Musk. In its explanation, xAI said it had modified the chatbot’s prompts and shared the changes publicly on GitHub “for transparency.” The company added it would keep monitoring and make further updates if necessary. This series of incidents comes after a 10-day period that began with xAI apologizing when Grok posted antisemitic statements and expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler on X. The company blamed “deprecated code” that made the chatbot susceptible to incorporating extremist content from other posts on X. Inside xAI, the fallout was immediate. Slack messages reviewed by Business Insider revealed some staff members were upset over the incident. One employee said the outburst prompted their resignation. Get seen where it counts.

As of August 12, this powerful index stands at 68, firmly entrenched in the ‘Greed’ zone. This slight dip from the previous day’s 70 still signals a strong, positive crypto market sentiment among investors. What does this mean for your crypto holdings, and how can you navigate these exciting times in the crypto greed zone ? What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reveal? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , developed by Alternative, offers a fascinating snapshot of investor psychology. It quantifies the prevailing emotions in the cryptocurrency market, ranging from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed). A score closer to 0 suggests investors are overly worried, potentially indicating a buying opportunity. Conversely, a score nearing 100 implies excessive enthusiasm, which could signal an impending market correction. This index is more than just a number; it is a vital pulse check on the collective mood, helping investors understand when irrational exuberance or panic might be taking hold, influencing overall crypto market sentiment . Decoding the Drivers: How is Market Sentiment Measured? Ever wondered how this crucial index calculates crypto market sentiment ? It’s a sophisticated blend of six key factors, each weighted to provide a comprehensive view. Understanding these components helps demystify the index’s movements. Volatility (25%): Measures current Bitcoin price volatility and maximum drawdowns, comparing them with average values. High volatility often signals fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Analyzes current market volume and momentum compared to average values. Strong buying volume indicates greed. Social Media (15%): Scans various social media platforms for crypto-related hashtags, analyzing volume and sentiment. High engagement and positive sentiment can drive the index up. Surveys (15%): These surveys, though currently paused, previously gathered investor opinions directly. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Assesses Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market capitalization. An increasing Bitcoin dominance can indicate fear as investors flock to BTC. Google Trends (10%): Examines Google search data for crypto-related terms. A surge in “Bitcoin price manipulation” searches, for instance, might indicate fear. Navigating the Crypto Greed Zone: What Does a Score of 68 Mean for You? A score of 68 firmly places the market in the crypto greed zone . While this indicates strong positive momentum and investor confidence, it also carries inherent risks. When the market is overly greedy, there is a heightened risk of price bubbles and subsequent corrections. Potential for Profit: High greed often accompanies rising prices, offering opportunities for short-term gains. Increased Market Volatility: Be prepared for swift price swings. Periods of high greed can precede significant pullbacks as early investors take profits. FOMO (Fear of Missing Out): The crypto greed zone can tempt new investors to jump in without sufficient research, driven by emotion rather than strategy. Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index helps you avoid emotional trading pitfalls and better assess the true crypto market sentiment . Actionable Insights for Prudent Crypto Investing Amidst High Bitcoin Dominance Using the Crypto Fear & Greed Index effectively means integrating it into a broader investment strategy, not relying on it as a sole predictor. Given the current Bitcoin dominance factor in the index, it’s wise to consider its broader implications. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always investigate projects thoroughly before investing. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders, especially with increased market volatility . Diversify Your Portfolio: Spread your investments across different cryptocurrencies to mitigate risks, even if Bitcoin dominance is high. Counter-Cyclical Thinking: Some investors use the index contrarianly – buying during ‘Extreme Fear’ and selling during ‘Extreme Greed.’ Monitor Market Volatility: Keep an eye on price fluctuations and volume trends, especially when the index is high, as this can signal shifts in crypto market sentiment . The Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 68 confirms a prevailing ‘Greed’ sentiment in the market, placing us squarely in the crypto greed zone . This powerful tool offers valuable insights into investor psychology and crypto market sentiment , serving as a reminder to approach the market with a balanced perspective. While positive sentiment can fuel growth, it also calls for heightened caution due to potential market volatility . Stay informed, manage your risks, and make decisions based on sound analysis, not just emotion. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index?

It raises questions over the future of assets like XRP and USDT. Meanwhile, traders are eyeing BNB and emerging presale tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE as possible safe havens amid tightening global rules. Beijing’s War on Stablecoins Expands China’s regulatory crackdown has intensified in recent weeks, targeting both the financial and data privacy sides of the crypto industry. In late July and early August, authorities ordered financial institutions and research bodies to halt seminars and investigations into stablecoin activity, reinforcing the blanket crypto ban in place since 2021. This was followed by an August 6 warning from the Ministry of State Security against foreign projects collecting biometric data, such as iris scans, over privacy and national security concerns. Shenzhen officials have also warned the public about stablecoin scams, signaling a coordinated nationwide push to curb perceived risks to financial stability and personal data protection. XRP & USDT in the Crosshairs XRP’s recent rally above $3 has buoyed investor sentiment, with a rare on-chain “MVRV golden cross” indicator flashing. This is a pattern that historically preceded gains of 54% and 630%. If history rhymes, XRP could hit between $5.10 and $24, surpassing its 2018 all-time high of $3.84. The recent settlement of the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit further fuels optimism. However, China’s crackdown introduces uncertainty, particularly for stablecoins like USDT, which plays a major role in XRP trading pairs. Tether’s Q2 attestation revealed $163.8B in circulating USDT and increased exposure to U.S. Treasury bills, but also raised eyebrows over its $10.1B in secured loans despite prior pledges to phase them out. The GENIUS Act in the U.S. could also reshape Tether’s strategy, with a domestic-focused stablecoin in the works to sidestep new reserve restrictions. BNB’s Technical and Corporate Tailwinds BNB is seeing fresh momentum, climbing past $760 after a 50% spike in trading volume and breaking through key resistance levels. Binance’s recent updates, including a new web-based wallet with pre-approved trade functionality and expanded bitcoin options access, have added to the bullish sentiment. Institutional participation is rising too: CEA Industries, Liminatus Pharma, and Windtree Therapeutics have announced plans involving billions in BNB-related allocations. Nano Labs has already bought 128,000 BNB for its treasury. If BNB holds above $761, it could retest its all-time high of $861, though resistance at $794 and $815 remains a near-term hurdle. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale — EXTRA50X Bonus Before It’s Gone For those seeking high-upside early entries, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale offers a limited-time 50% token bonus with code EXTRA50X. This next-gen, community-owned token blends meme coin virality with real DeFi utility. Its zero-tax, security-audited model has already drawn 12,000+ holders. With top-tier exchange listings rumored and early growth metrics rivaling PEPE and SHIB, the bonus offer adds extra value, but it’s available only while the presale lasts. Conclusion As China’s stablecoin crackdown shakes parts of the market, traders are rotating toward assets with stronger fundamentals, rising adoption, and presale incentives. BNB’s breakout and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s time-sensitive 50% bonus offer both stand out as strategic plays in this shifting landscape.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman believes the shift will open doors to careers that sound more like science fiction than reality—especially for the graduates of 2035. Speaking to video journalist Cleo Abram, Altman said that by 2035, some graduates may step straight from the lecture hall onto a spacecraft . “That graduating college student, if they still go to college at all, could very well be leaving on a mission to explore the solar system,” he said. These jobs, he explained, will be completely new, exciting, super well-paid, super interesting, and will make today’s work seem dull in comparison. He even joked that future workers might feel “bad” for earlier generations who had to settle for “boring, old work.” While it may sound futuristic, the space industry is already expanding. NASA aims to send humans to Mars in the 2030s. SpaceX, Blue Origin , and other private firms work on lunar bases, asteroid mining, and deep space exploration. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects faster-than-average growth in aerospace engineering, with median annual pay already topping $130,000. AI’s role in this expansion is clear: it can design spacecraft faster, predict mission risks more accurately, and even control autonomous robots on other planets. This means the next wave of space careers could be as much about coding and AI systems as rocket science. Older workers battle steep challenges Altman’s vision is bright for younger generations but more uncertain for older professionals. He pointed out that while a 22-year-old can easily adapt to new AI-powered tools, a 62-year-old might struggle to retrain or reenter a transformed job market. Altman said that 22-year-olds today are the luckiest generation in history, as they are entering a world where AI can serve as a personal expert, collaborator, and accelerator for almost any task. He noted, however, that for those approaching retirement, the shift may feel more like a disruption than an opportunity. Other technology leaders agree that AI will change the rhythm of work itself. Bill Gates has suggested that AI could make a three-day workweek possible, freeing people from routine tasks. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says AI already gives his employees “superhuman” abilities, letting them work at levels that once required entire teams. Experts warn that the risk is that older workers could be left behind in a rapidly changing labor market without proper policies and retraining programs. Young founders go big solo Altman said AI’s real power lies in replacing jobs and creating new ones. He stated that GPT-5 and similar models could allow individuals to run companies that once required hundreds of employees, adding that it might now be possible for a single person to start a company that could grow to be worth more than a billion dollars. He sees a future where entrepreneurs can design their product with AI, market it using AI, service customers with AI, and, most importantly, coordinate large-scale manufacturing without hiring armies of staff. For him, all you need is a fabulous idea and the weapons to use AI tools correctly. Mark Cuban said AI could produce the world’s first trillionaire, possibly a single entrepreneur working remotely. He added that nothing seen so far matches what the technology will eventually be able to do. Nevertheless, it is a pressure-filled opportunity. In an AI-driven economy where everyone can make money from data, you must be innovative and change-ready rather than certified. For the Class of 2035, this may involve skills that serve a career in space travel, combined with AI mastery and entrepreneurship, all at once. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Currently, the spotlight is firmly on the Altcoin Season Index , a key metric tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC). This index recently registered a significant 30, signaling a clear shift in the broader crypto market trends towards what is known as Bitcoin Season . This development, reported at 00:30 UTC on August 12, shows a six-point drop from the previous day’s figure. This dip below the critical threshold highlights a period where Bitcoin’s dominance is reasserting itself over other digital assets. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Reveal? The Altcoin Season Index provides a clear snapshot of market sentiment and asset performance. It meticulously compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, over the past 90 days. The index aims to determine whether the majority of these assets are outperforming Bitcoin. Here’s how the index defines its seasons: Altcoin Season: Occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 coins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index score typically rises significantly, often above 75. Bitcoin Season: This phase is signaled when 25% or fewer of the top 100 coins manage to outperform Bitcoin. Our current index reading of 30 firmly places us in this category, indicating a period of strong Bitcoin leadership and subdued altcoin performance . Understanding these cryptocurrency cycles is vital for making informed decisions. The index score, ranging from 1 to 100, offers a quick visual guide to the prevailing market conditions. Navigating Bitcoin Season: Understanding Current Crypto Market Trends When the market enters Bitcoin Season , it typically means that capital is flowing more heavily into Bitcoin, or Bitcoin is simply holding its value better during downturns. This often happens after a period of significant altcoin gains, or during times of general market uncertainty when investors seek the perceived safety of Bitcoin. For investors, this shift implies a few key considerations: Dominance Shift: Bitcoin’s market capitalization typically increases relative to the total crypto market. Reduced Altcoin Volatility (Sometimes): While altcoins can still be volatile, their independent pumps might be less frequent or less pronounced compared to Altcoin Season. Focus on Fundamentals: Investors often return to evaluating Bitcoin’s core strengths, such as its role as a store of value or its network security. This period allows for a recalibration of portfolios. It is an opportunity to observe which altcoins show resilience even when the broader market favors Bitcoin, offering insights into potential future leaders. Strategies for Optimal Altcoin Performance During Bitcoin Season Even in Bitcoin Season , smart strategies can help optimize your altcoin performance and overall portfolio. It’s not about abandoning altcoins entirely, but rather adjusting your approach. Consider these actionable insights: Research Deeply: Focus on altcoins with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases. These projects may be better positioned to recover or even thrive once the market shifts back. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of large lump-sum investments, consider regularly investing smaller amounts into promising altcoins. This strategy can help mitigate risk during volatile periods. Rebalancing Portfolios: You might consider increasing your Bitcoin allocation temporarily to ride its momentum, or strategically accumulating undervalued altcoins that you believe have long-term potential. Monitor Market Sentiment: Keep an eye on the Altcoin Season Index and other indicators. Changes in the index can signal a potential shift back towards altcoins. The current market state, indicated by the Altcoin Season Index at 30, highlights a prevailing Bitcoin Season . This phase is a natural part of the dynamic cryptocurrency cycles . While Bitcoin takes the lead, it also presents unique opportunities for investors to refine their strategies and prepare for the next market shift. Staying informed and adaptable is key to navigating these exciting, yet often unpredictable, market conditions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Altcoin Season Index? A1: The Altcoin Season Index is a metric from CoinMarketCap that tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. It helps indicate whether altcoins or Bitcoin are currently dominating the market. Q2: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 30 mean? A2: An index reading of 30 indicates that the market is currently in ‘Bitcoin Season’. This means 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days, suggesting Bitcoin is leading the market. Q3: How long does Bitcoin Season typically last? A3: The duration of Bitcoin Season varies widely. It is part of the natural cryptocurrency cycles and can last weeks or even months, depending on broader market sentiment, economic factors, and Bitcoin’s price action. Q4: What strategies should investors consider during Bitcoin Season? A4: During Bitcoin Season, investors might consider dollar-cost averaging into promising altcoins, rebalancing portfolios to increase Bitcoin exposure, and focusing on altcoins with strong fundamentals. Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index for shifts is also crucial. Q5: Does Bitcoin Season mean altcoins are worthless? A5: No, Bitcoin Season does not mean altcoins are worthless.

This sparked a sharp rally in both LayerZero’s ZRO token and Stargate’s STG token, which surged 26% and 20% respectively in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Solana Faces Mid-Channel Standoff As Hourly Weakness Challenges Bullish Structure The proposal, posted on Stargate DAO’s forum, seeks to dissolve the Stargate DAO and phase out the STG token. In its place, holders would swap each STG for 0.08634 ZRO through a fixed-rate redemption contract. This shift would make ZRO the sole token powering the merged ecosystem while maintaining uninterrupted bridge. If approved, LayerZero will assume full control over Stargate’s operations, with revenues redirected toward ZRO buybacks, a move intended to strengthen the token’s long-term value. LayerZero (ZRO) Price Outlook Amid Bullish Momentum Following the announcement, ZRO climbed to $2.30, accompanied by a 540% surge in trading volume. Analysts suggest that breaking above $2.80 could pave the way toward the $3 psychological level. In parallel, the STG token experienced a rise of over 20% within the last 24 hours, reaching $0.20 at present. This positive movement reflects investor confidence in the token’s prospective performance in the cryptosphere. While enthusiasm is high, the proposal has drawn mixed reactions from STG holders, with some arguing the swap undervalues their tokens and removes staking rewards. The proposal requires a 70% supermajority vote from the DAO to pass, with community discussions underway. ZRO's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: ZROUSD on Tradingview Strategic Push for a Unified Cross-Chain Ecosystem LayerZero’s acquisition proposal is structured as a strategic alignment intended to combine governance, improve technical efficiency, and support ongoing development. Stargate, launched by LayerZero in 2022, has processed over $70 billion in cross-chain transactions but has struggled to translate its network activity into sustained STG token growth. CEO Bryan Pellegrino described the plan as a “single unified direction” for both projects, allowing Stargate to execute on an ambitious roadmap while benefiting from LayerZero’s broader infrastructure.

This massive ETH accumulation highlights significant confidence in Ethereum’s future, capturing the attention of investors and market watchers alike. It’s not just a large sum; it represents a strategic, ongoing move by what appears to be a sophisticated institutional entity. According to Onchain Lens on X, this prominent investor holds a staggering 293,184 ETH across nine distinct wallets. This methodical approach to building such a substantial position, utilizing platforms like FalconX, Galaxy Digital, and BitGo, suggests a calculated and long-term vision rather than speculative trading. This kind of institutional ETH investment often signals broader market trends. Who is This Mysterious Large ETH Holder? While the exact identity of this large ETH holder remains anonymous, the consistent accumulation patterns point towards a highly organized and well-resourced entity. The use of regulated and institutional-grade platforms such as FalconX, Galaxy Digital, and BitGo further supports the theory that this is not a lone retail investor. Instead, it’s likely a fund, a high-net-worth individual with substantial capital, or even a corporation diversifying its treasury assets into digital currencies. This systematic buying strategy, spread across multiple wallets, could be a tactic to manage risk, enhance security, or simply to execute large orders without causing significant market disruptions. Such significant crypto whale activity often precedes or influences market movements, making it a key indicator for many analysts. What Drives Such Significant ETH Accumulation? The decision to accumulate such a vast amount of Ethereum is rarely impulsive. Several factors likely contribute to this strategic ETH accumulation : Long-Term Confidence: The investor likely holds a strong conviction in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition, including its role in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and the broader Web3 ecosystem. Staking Rewards: Holding a large amount of ETH allows for significant staking rewards, providing a passive income stream and further incentivizing long-term holding. Market Position: Building such a large position grants the holder considerable influence, potentially allowing them to become a key player in governance or liquidity provision within the Ethereum network. Inflation Hedge: For many institutional players, cryptocurrencies like Ethereum serve as a hedge against traditional market inflation and economic uncertainties. This persistent buying suggests a belief that Ethereum, despite its past volatility, is poised for continued growth and adoption. The Impact of Institutional ETH Investment on the Market When a substantial Ethereum whale makes such moves, the entire market takes notice. This ongoing accumulation has several potential implications: Supply Shock Potential: If a significant portion of ETH is locked away in long-term holdings, it reduces the circulating supply, which can exert upward pressure on prices, especially if demand increases. Market Sentiment Boost: Large-scale institutional interest can instill confidence in other investors, signaling that “smart money” sees value in Ethereum. This positive sentiment can attract further capital. Increased Legitimacy: The involvement of institutional-grade platforms like FalconX and Galaxy Digital lends credibility to the crypto space, bridging the gap between traditional finance and digital assets. Observing this particular large ETH holder provides valuable insights into how sophisticated investors are approaching the digital asset landscape. It underscores a growing trend of traditional financial players exploring and committing capital to the crypto market. How Does This Crypto Whale Activity Affect You? While most individual investors cannot replicate the scale of this crypto whale activity , understanding it can inform your own strategy. It highlights the importance of conviction and a long-term outlook when investing in volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Consider these actionable insights: Research Beyond the Hype: Focus on the fundamental technology and adoption of projects, similar to how institutional investors conduct their due diligence. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Even large holders diversify their risk. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on on-chain data and institutional movements, as they can provide early signals of market shifts. This particular Ethereum whale serves as a fascinating case study in strategic digital asset management, demonstrating the power of consistent, well-planned investment. In conclusion, the sustained accumulation of over $1.24 billion in ETH by a single, sophisticated investor underscores a powerful vote of confidence in Ethereum’s future. This significant ETH accumulation , facilitated through institutional channels, points to a maturation of the crypto market and a growing acceptance among large-scale financial players. As this large ETH holder continues to build its formidable position, it offers a compelling narrative for the ongoing institutionalization of digital assets, shaping the future of the crypto landscape.

49945595,553573,1754960412,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49945595.jpeg,"Bitcoin Surges Past $122K, Nearing All-Time High on ETF Inflows and Corporate Buys",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-surges-past-122k-nearing-all-time-high-etf/,"Bitcoin (BTC) surged past $122,000 on Monday, coming within 1% of its all-time high of $123,218. The rally has been fueled by high spot Bitcoin ETF inflows, renewed corporate accumulation, and a pro-crypto policy shift from the White House. Over the last three days of trading, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs absorbed $773 million in net inflows, according to Farside Investors . BlackRock’s IBIT fund now holds $80 billion in BTC, closing in on the $94 billion held by the largest gold ETF. On the corporate front, Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy signaled continued Bitcoin purchases, expanding its already massive $76.8 billion treasury. Henrik Andersson, CIO at Apollo Crypto, described the move above $122K as “just a matter of time” after a month-long consolidation between $115K and $120K. Trump’s Pro-Crypto Policies Ignite Wave of Bitcoin Optimism A major catalyst has been President Donald Trump’s recent executive order enabling 401(k) retirement plans to invest in cryptocurrencies. This policy could open up $9 trillion in retirement assets to Bitcoin , potentially driving significant long-term demand. Technical indicators remain bullish. The daily RSI sits at 67.7, signaling strong momentum without entering overbought territory, while the MACD has posted a bullish crossover. Analysts believe a decisive break above $123K could trigger algorithmic buying and retail FOMO, pushing BTC toward the $126K–$129K range. Broader Crypto Market Hits $4.14 Trillion Bitcoin’s rally has helped lift the total cryptocurrency market capitalization to an all-time high of $4.14 trillion. Ethereum (ETH) also surged, crossing $4,300 for the first time since 2021, supported by $4 billion in institutional inflows and the launch of ETH-focused ETFs. Despite the bullish trend, sentiment remains measured. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index stands at 70/100, indicating enthusiasm but avoiding extreme euphoria. Google search interest for Bitcoin has also risen modestly, suggesting room for further retail participation. With institutional inflows strong, corporate adoption rising, and regulatory clarity improving, analysts say Bitcoin is well-positioned for another leg higher. A clean break above $123K could open the door to $130K in the near term, and potentially $150K by year-end if macroeconomic conditions remain favorable.

On August 8, ETH surged past the $4,000 mark and briefly touched $4,200, its highest point since late 2021. The move forced $105 million in short positions to close, giving bulls the upper hand as momentum builds. Driving this rally were $222 million in ETH ETF inflows over just two days, led by BlackRock’s ETHA product. That kind of institutional buying power has reignited speculation that ETH could challenge Bitcoin’s dominance in the months ahead. Meanwhile, capital rotation into altcoins is picking up pace—lifting not just majors like Bitcoin and Solana, but also early-stage projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE that traders believe could deliver outsized returns. Why ETH’s Rally Matters for the Market Ethereum’s move past $4,000 wasn’t just a chart milestone—it was backed by strong fundamentals. Alongside the ETF inflows, trading volumes spiked to three times their daily average. Bitcoin dominance slipped below 60%, showing clear evidence of altseason activity. Technical traders point to a clean breakout pattern, with a retest of $4,000 potentially setting the stage for another push higher. Layer-2 networks like Optimism and Polygon are also benefiting from the ETH surge, with rising user activity and transaction volumes. Bitcoin and Solana Keep Pace Bitcoin (BTC) is holding steady near $117,000, just shy of its yearly high. Institutional interest remains strong, and analysts believe a breakout above $120,000 could trigger a wave of new buying. Solana (SOL) has also been quietly building strength, now up nearly 10% over the past week to $180.49. Infrastructure upgrades and rising network adoption have fueled optimism, with traders eyeing the $200 level as the next big target. PEPE and SHIB Millionaires Turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE for the Next Big Run While big names dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting its own share of attention. PEPE and SHIB millionaires—who’ve already seen most of their upside in earlier meme coin runs—are rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE in search of the next breakout. The project’s momentum is hard to ignore. Wallet activity is climbing, whales are steadily accumulating, and the presale is moving at record speed. Analysts say the blend of political meme culture, verified smart contract security, and a fast-growing community make MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the most compelling early-stage plays of 2025. Also, investor interest is at an all-time high, and MAGACOIN FINANCE presale demand is exploding. Final Thoughts Ethereum’s surge past $4,000 has sparked a wave of bullish sentiment across the crypto market. Bitcoin, Solana, and Layer-2 projects are all benefiting from the renewed momentum—and smaller altcoins are riding the same tide. With demand rising and presale allocations disappearing fast, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the low-cap name to watch. For investors seeking high-upside plays during this rally, it might just be the next headline-maker of the year.

Recently, renowned crypto analyst and trader Ali Martinez shared a fascinating insight on X: these powerful entities have made substantial acquisitions. In just 48 hours, they purchased a staggering 900 million XRP and 200 million ADA. This massive accumulation by XRP whales and ADA whales raises important questions about market sentiment and potential future price action. Understanding why these significant players make such moves can offer valuable perspectives for all market participants. Understanding the Influence of XRP Whales and ADA Whales When we talk about crypto whales , we refer to individuals or entities holding vast amounts of a particular cryptocurrency. Their trades are so large that they can significantly influence market prices and liquidity. Ali Martinez’s report highlights an extraordinary buying spree, indicating strong conviction among these large holders. The acquisition of 900 million XRP by XRP whales is particularly noteworthy. XRP, a digital asset designed for global payments, has a large circulating supply. A purchase of this magnitude suggests a bullish outlook on its future utility and adoption. Similarly, the 200 million ADA acquired by ADA whales points to confidence in Cardano’s ecosystem and its ongoing development. What Does This Mean for XRP Price and ADA Price ? The immediate impact of such large purchases is often a subject of intense speculation. While direct correlation is not guaranteed, significant accumulation by whales can signal a few key things: Increased Demand: Large purchases absorb available supply, potentially driving up the XRP price and ADA price if demand continues to outpace supply. Investor Confidence: Whale activity can inspire confidence among smaller investors, leading to a broader buying trend. Anticipation of Events: Whales might be positioning themselves ahead of anticipated positive news, network upgrades, or regulatory clarity for XRP and ADA. However, it’s crucial to remember that whale movements are just one piece of the puzzle. Market sentiment, global economic factors, and project developments also play significant roles in determining the long-term trajectory of the XRP price and ADA price . Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights from Crypto Whales For everyday investors, monitoring whale activity can be a useful, though not foolproof, strategy. It provides a glimpse into the actions of those with deep pockets and potentially insider knowledge or advanced market analysis capabilities. Here are some actionable insights: Observe Trends: Look for consistent accumulation or distribution patterns rather than isolated events. Sustained buying by crypto whales often indicates a stronger conviction. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always complement whale watching with thorough research into the fundamentals of XRP and ADA. Understand their use cases, technology, and development roadmaps. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Even significant whale activity does not eliminate market volatility or the potential for price corrections. Diversify Your Portfolio: Relying solely on whale movements can be risky. A diversified portfolio helps mitigate exposure to the performance of any single asset. The recent acquisitions of XRP and ADA by these influential market players serve as a powerful reminder of the dynamic nature of the crypto space. While their actions offer intriguing signals, a balanced approach combining market observation with diligent research remains paramount for informed decision-making. The recent reports of crypto whales accumulating vast amounts of XRP and ADA underscore the ongoing confidence among major investors in these digital assets. Whether these strategic moves lead to significant upward momentum for the XRP price and ADA price remains to be seen, but they certainly add an exciting layer to the current market narrative. For investors, these insights offer a chance to consider broader market sentiment while always prioritizing their own investment strategies and risk tolerance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are crypto whales? Crypto whales are individuals or entities that hold a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. Their significant holdings mean their buying or selling activities can have a substantial impact on the market price and liquidity of that asset. Why do whale movements matter for XRP and ADA?

Large purchases often suggest confidence in the asset’s future prospects. Does whale accumulation guarantee price increases for XRP or ADA? No, whale accumulation does not guarantee price increases. While it can be a bullish signal, the market is influenced by numerous factors including overall market trends, regulatory news, global economic conditions, and project-specific developments. Whales can also sell their holdings, impacting prices. How can I track crypto whale activity? You can track crypto whale activity through various on-chain analytics platforms and services that monitor large transactions. Many crypto news outlets and social media analysts also report on significant whale movements. What are the risks associated with following whale movements?

This $0.035 Token Tops the List,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/what-crypto-to-buy-before-bitcoins-btc-next-move-this-0-035-token-tops-the-list/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is holding steady near $117,000, with traders watching closely for its next decisive move. While the possibility of a push beyond $120K excites the market, seasoned investors know that the largest gains often come from catching the right project before it breaks into the mainstream. One name keeps surfacing in whale wallets and DeFi circles: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a token still in presale at just $0.035. And with its beta launch, anticipated top-tier exchange listings, and a credible DeFi product already mapped out, it’s being positioned by many as the best crypto to buy before Bitcoin’s next leg up. Why Bitcoin Might Not Deliver the Biggest Gains This Time BTC’s stability is a strength, but it’s also a limitation for those seeking high multiples. The asset has already broken records, drawing steady inflows from institutions and ETF buyers. While the long-term outlook remains bullish, short-term percentage returns are likely to be modest compared to the potential of well-structured, early-stage tokens. That’s why attention is drifting toward projects like Mutuum Finance—where early entries can magnify upside if adoption and liquidity arrive as expected. Mutuum Finance: Presale Momentum That Signals Confidence Mutuum Finance has raised $14.3 million from more than 15,000 holders—a figure that speaks to growing investor conviction. At its current price of $0.035, the token is still accessible to retail buyers, but whale accumulation is making headlines. With top-tier exchange listings expected around launch and the beta version of the platform planned to go live by then, projections for the token’s early trading window are ambitious. Analysts following the project suggest that its listing will push gains up to 700% from current levels, setting the tone for a strong first year on the market. How the Lending and Borrowing Engine Works Users who deposit assets such as ETH or DAI are issued mtTokens, like mtETH or mtDAI, in equal quantity to what they supplied. Over time, the amount each mtToken can be exchanged for grows as interest builds, meaning holders see their redemption value rise while the number of tokens in their wallet stays exactly the same. Borrowers can secure liquidity by locking up overcollateralized assets, with no fixed repayment deadlines, as long as their collateral remains above the set threshold. This flexibility is particularly appealing to long-term holders looking to leverage their assets without selling them. Security, Trust and a Built-in Growth Mechanism Investor trust has been bolstered through a successful CertiK audit, confirming the soundness of Mutuum Finance’s smart contracts and earning the project an impressive 95/100 token score. On top of that, a bug bounty program rewards developers for identifying and reporting vulnerabilities, keeping the protocol secure post-launch. The platform’s revenue model also adds a layer of built-in token demand. A portion of protocol fees will be used to buy MUTM on the open market, with those tokens redistributed to users staking mtTokens in the safety module—creating a continuous loop of demand tied to actual platform activity. Why This Matters Before Bitcoin’s Next Move Bitcoin’s price movements often set the tone for the wider market, and when it begins a strong upward run, capital tends to flow quickly into promising altcoins. The tokens that benefit most are typically those already building momentum before BTC breaks higher. Mutuum Finance is positioned to do just that. With a growing base of committed holders, whale inflows during its $0.035 presale, and anticipated top-tier exchange listings aligning with its beta launch, the project is primed to attract liquidity at the right moment. For those looking to position themselves before Bitcoin’s next surge, MUTM offers early access to a DeFi ecosystem that’s already generating attention from serious investors, making it one of the most strategic buys ahead of the market’s next move.

At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a chance for big gains because it is still early in its journey. If ETFs get the green light, prices for SOL, ETH, and XRP could rise quickly. For investors who want exposure to new projects with high growth potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE is worth a look. Its strong community and solid plans make it a coin to watch as the year wraps up. Conclusion Solana, Ethereum, and XRP are positioned well for growth due to the ETF race. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a low-cost altcoin with huge upside potential.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin staged a sharp recovery over the past week, rebounding from a dip below $114,000 to trade near $121,000, in what Glassnode described in a recent report as a shift from “seller exhaustion to a strong rebound near recent ATHs.” The rally, however, came without a surge in spot market participation. Glassnode data shows spot trading volumes fell 22% to $5.7 billion, close to their statistical low band, suggesting the rebound has been driven more by positioning shifts than deep conviction buying. The Spot Cumulative Volume Delta flipped 94% toward buy pressure, a sign that aggressive selling has been replaced by renewed demand, but not yet across a broad base of traders. On the derivatives side, leveraged traders re-engaged aggressively, Glassnode detailed in its report. Perpetual Cumulative Volume Delta, a measure of the buy-sell pressure in perps, jumped 88%, funding rates remained elevated, and options open interest climbed 6.7% to $42.4 billion. Yet, volatility pricing collapsed by almost a third, indicating a degree of complacency that has historically preceded large market moves. ETF flows offered some relief, with U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETF outflows halving to $311 million from $686 million the prior week. Even so, ETF trade volume fell 27.7% to $13.7 billion, keeping activity near its low band. QCP Capital framed the weekend surge, which briefly pushed BTC above $122,000, as a function of thin order books and a broader risk-on shift in global markets. “Crypto staged an impressive comeback over the weekend during thin, low-liquidity trading hours,” the Singapore-based trading firm wrote, noting that the bounce aligned with a rebound in U.S. equities and growing expectations for a September Fed rate cut. While on-chain activity improved, active addresses jumped 8.4% to 793,000, and fee volume rose 10%. Glassnode cautioned that elevated profitability levels could quickly turn into selling pressure if sentiment shifts. With 94.1% of supply in profit and the realized profit-to-loss ratio climbing to 1.9, the market may be nearing a point where profit-taking accelerates. The combination of thin liquidity, bullish derivatives positioning, and macro-driven optimism leaves Bitcoin primed for volatile moves as it approaches all-time highs, with the next test likely coming from Tuesday’s U.S. CPI release. Polymarket traders lean toward a modest uptick in line with consensus that would likely keep BTC consolidating, with hotter prints posing a short-term headwind by delaying Fed cuts and softer readings offering a potential breakout catalyst if ETF flows and spot activity strengthen. Market Movers BTC: Bitcoin is trading at $118k as traders pull back and position themselves for the possibility that Tuesday's CPI report might break BTC's momentum. ETH: Ethereum is trading at $4200. Analysts say that ETH's rally is partially due to increased capacity on-chain and lower DeFi costs. Gold: Gold slid to $3,355.13 as upbeat risk sentiment and Trump’s pledge to exclude gold from tariffs weighed on safe-haven demand, though losses were cushioned by rising Fed rate cut bets ahead of this week’s U.S. inflation data. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets rose Tuesday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 hitting a record high after the U.S.-China trade truce was extended, while investors awaited the Reserve Bank of Australia’s expected rate cut. S&P 500: U.S. stocks eased, with the S&P 500 down 0.2% and just under its record, as investors await new inflation data .Meanwhile, Citigroup and UBS lifted their year-end S&P 500 targets, citing easing policy risks and solid earnings, with Citi raising its forecast to 6,600 and UBS to 6,100.

This dramatic move involves a substantial bet against the future of Ethereum price , catching the attention of investors and analysts across the globe. Such high-stakes plays are always fascinating to watch. Understanding This Massive ETH Short Position Recently, a notable whale trader known as AguilaTrades executed a colossal short position on Ethereum (ETH) through the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid. This strategic move involves 30,001 ETH, valued at an astonishing $128.45 million. It clearly indicates a strong bearish sentiment on the immediate future of Ethereum price . The trade utilizes a substantial 15x crypto leverage , which amplifies both potential gains and, crucially, potential losses. This kind of high-stakes play always garners significant attention in the crypto market, particularly when a known whale trader is involved. Who is AguilaTrades and What is Hyperliquid? AguilaTrades is a recognized whale trader , an individual or entity holding a vast amount of cryptocurrency. Their trades often signal market sentiment and can significantly influence market dynamics. The crypto community closely monitors their actions for insights into potential market shifts. The platform used for this particular ETH short position , Hyperliquid, is a cutting-edge decentralized exchange (DEX). Unlike centralized exchanges, DEXs operate without an intermediary, allowing peer-to-peer transactions directly on the blockchain. This offers greater transparency and often higher crypto leverage options, but it also comes with unique risks due to its permissionless nature. The Perils of High Crypto Leverage in Trading This specific ETH short position comes with 15x crypto leverage , a powerful financial tool that allows traders to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. While leverage can magnify profits if the market moves in the desired direction, it also dramatically increases the risk of liquidation. For this trade, the liquidation price is set at $4,383.66. If the Ethereum price reaches or exceeds this level, the position will be automatically closed by the exchange, resulting in a complete loss of the collateral used for the trade. This highlights the inherent volatility and extreme risk associated with high-leverage trading in the crypto space, especially for an ETH short position of this magnitude. Key aspects of leveraged trading: Amplified Returns: Small price movements can lead to significant profits. Increased Risk: Losses are also amplified, potentially leading to rapid liquidation. Liquidation Price: A critical threshold where the position is automatically closed to prevent further losses beyond the collateral. How Might This Whale Trader’s Move Impact Ethereum Price? The placement of such a significant ETH short position by a prominent whale trader often signals a strong belief that the Ethereum price is poised for a downturn. While one trade alone might not crash the entire market, large positions like this can create ripple effects. Other traders might interpret this as a bearish signal, potentially leading to increased selling pressure across the market. Moreover, the sheer size of the position means that if it were to be liquidated, the forced buying of ETH to cover the short could cause a temporary upward price spike. Conversely, if the trade is successful, the closing of the position could add significant selling pressure. Monitoring activity on a decentralized exchange like Hyperliquid provides crucial insights into large market movements and potential future trends for Ethereum price . In summary, AguilaTrades’ audacious $128 million ETH short position on Hyperliquid serves as a powerful reminder of the high stakes and potential volatility within the cryptocurrency markets. This strategic move by a prominent whale trader , utilizing significant crypto leverage , underscores the ongoing battle between bullish and bearish sentiments influencing the Ethereum price . Whether this bet pays off or leads to a substantial loss remains to be seen, but it certainly adds an intriguing layer to the current market narrative on this leading decentralized exchange . It’s a prime example of how individual high-net-worth players can influence perceptions and potentially market dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is an ETH short position? An ETH short position is a trading strategy where an investor borrows Ethereum and sells it, expecting its price to fall. The goal is to buy it back at a lower price later, return the borrowed ETH, and profit from the price difference. 2. Who is AguilaTrades? AguilaTrades is identified as a ‘whale trader,’ meaning an individual or entity holding a very large amount of cryptocurrency. Their substantial trades can significantly influence market sentiment and price movements. 3. What is Hyperliquid? Hyperliquid is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other, without the need for a centralized intermediary. It often offers high leverage options. 4. What does 15x crypto leverage mean? 15x crypto leverage means that for every $1 of your own capital, you can control $15 worth of a cryptocurrency position. While this amplifies potential profits, it also significantly magnifies potential losses and increases the risk of liquidation. 5. How can a whale trader’s actions affect Ethereum price? When a whale trader places a large position, like this significant ETH short, it can signal their market conviction. This can influence other traders’ perceptions, potentially leading to a cascade of similar trades that collectively impact the Ethereum price by increasing buying or selling pressure.

The company’s SEC filing says MARA’s French unit, MARA France SAS, will buy new and existing shares to own 64% of Exaion, a high-performance computing and AI infrastructure firm. The deal should close in late 2025 or early 2026, once regulators in France and Canada approve it. MARA buys majority stake in Exaion to grow AI business MARA will shift from being known purely as a large-scale Bitcoin miner to becoming a major player in the AI infrastructure industry by committing to a multi-step investment plan. The company will acquire 4.1 million newly issued shares in Exaion, a French company operating high-performance computing and cloud services for demanding digital workloads, through a €115 million deal. The company will also buy 1.2 million existing shares from EDF Pulse Holding and other minority owners for €33 million. €23 million will be paid at the closing of the deal, and €10 million in 2027 if Exaion meets certain agreed performance targets. This deal will give the Bitcoin mining firm the power to guide the company’s growth strategy and future direction while still keeping EDF as a minority partner through a controlling interest of 64% in Exaion. MARA also plans to raise its ownership stake to approximately 75% by acquiring an additional 3.9 million shares in Exaion for about €110 million in March 2027. This second phase will ensure there remains a link between Exaion’s utility heritage and its expanding role in technology by giving MARA even greater control over Exaion’s operations while keeping EDF’s minority position intact. Depending on how long it takes to meet all closing conditions, the company expects the first phase to close either in the final quarter of 2025 or the first quarter of 2026. This is because the transaction is still subject to approvals from regulators in France and Canada. MARA carefully planned this deal to enter a sector that is growing quickly and to exploit the opportunities that go beyond the sometimes-volatile revenue streams of cryptocurrency mining. Exaion provides advanced computing power through high-performance data centers and specialized cloud platforms. These facilities handle complex and heavy workloads essential for running artificial intelligence applications, big data analysis, and other resource-intensive digital operations. As more organizations demand tighter control over where their data is stored and how it is processed, MARA’s focus on digital sovereignty comes in handy. Rather than outsourcing everything to global hyperscale providers, the company’s clients can process and store sensitive information within secure systems that comply with regional data protection rules. MARA is stepping into a market that complements its existing expertise in managing large-scale, energy-intensive computing operations by acquiring a controlling stake in Exaion. The company will focus on AI inference (running and using already trained models to perform tasks) instead of investing heavily in training AI models from scratch, which requires massive resources. AI growth offers new income for Bitcoin miners There is a sharp rise in demand for computing power capable of handling the enormous workloads required by advanced AI applications, as the market is growing at an extraordinary pace. MARA focuses on AI infrastructure services that can be delivered to a broader range of clients, while competitors such as Core Scientific and Hut 8 target hyperscale cloud providers instead. Since MARA is not entirely dependent on large cloud providers to generate business, it can engage with the AI market in a way that is more controlled and potentially more profitable. The company can offer tailored solutions that meet each client’s specific computing and data needs by positioning itself to work directly with customers. MARA is also continuing to pursue an aggressive Bitcoin treasury strategy that has become a defining feature of its overall business model. To buy more Bitcoin while continuing to hold onto every coin it mines, it raised $950 million through equity and debt financing. The announcement of MARA’s deal with EDF’s Exaion gave the company a market value of $5.8 billion after its shares rose 1.8% to $15.67 in the New York trading session. MARA will receive strong positions in both the rapidly evolving AI sector and the established but still volatile world of cryptocurrency mining if the acquisition goes through as planned.

Nasdaq-listed CEA Industries has made a groundbreaking move, officially acquiring a staggering 200,000 BNB token acquisition . This monumental investment, valued at approximately $160 million, positions CEA Industries as the single largest corporate holder of BNB worldwide, according to reports from Solid Intel on X. This strategic decision marks a pivotal moment, signaling a growing trend of major companies venturing into substantial corporate crypto investment . The bold action by CEA Industries BNB acquisition highlights a deepening institutional interest in digital assets. What Propelled CEA Industries’ Massive BNB Token Acquisition? This isn’t just a spontaneous purchase; CEA Industries’ significant BNB token acquisition follows a robust financial maneuver. The company recently completed a substantial $500 million private funding round. This round was notably led by Easy Labs, a key player whose backing indicates strong confidence in CEA Industries’ strategic direction and its future Nasdaq crypto holdings . Strategic Investment: The funding was specifically earmarked to support CEA Industries’ ambitious investment in BNB. This suggests a well-thought-out strategy rather than a speculative gamble. Market Impact: Such a large-scale move by a Nasdaq-listed entity like CEA Industries sends a powerful message about the increasing mainstream acceptance of digital assets. Confidence in BNB: Becoming the largest corporate holder of BNB globally underscores a profound belief in the long-term value and utility of the BNB ecosystem. This move highlights a shift in how traditional corporations view and engage with the digital asset landscape, moving beyond mere curiosity to direct, impactful corporate crypto investment . Why Are Companies Embracing Corporate Crypto Investment? The decision by CEA Industries to commit such a significant amount to corporate crypto investment isn’t an isolated incident. Many corporations are now exploring or actively engaging with digital assets for various reasons, seeking new avenues for growth and diversification, especially regarding their Nasdaq crypto holdings . Diversification: Companies aim to diversify their treasury holdings beyond traditional fiat currencies and bonds, seeking potentially higher returns. Inflation Hedge: In an environment of rising inflation concerns, some view cryptocurrencies as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat money. Future-Proofing: Investing in digital assets can be seen as a way to align with the evolving financial landscape and prepare for a more digital future. Ecosystem Participation: For some, like CEA Industries with BNB, it’s about participating in a specific blockchain ecosystem, potentially leveraging its services or community.

The gains have coincided with improved sentiment in US equity markets, with QCP Capital noting that the correlation between Bitcoin and equity performance has strengthened since mid-July. Total market capitalization for digital assets also surged above $4.1 trillion, reflecting an increase on Monday. The upcoming CPI report is being closely monitored for signs of inflationary trends. Consensus expectations point to a year-over-year increase of 10 basis points in headline inflation, bringing it to 2.8%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Flips Negative After July Peak – Risk Appetite Cools QCP Capital stated that a softer reading could reinforce expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut in September, while a higher-than-expected figure might disrupt the rally in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Analysts suggest that the market is preparing for both outcomes, with positioning in derivatives markets indicating hedging on the downside while still leaving room for upward momentum. Bitcoin and ETH Derivatives Data Signals Market Caution Options market activity shows that traders are actively preparing for volatility around the CPI release. QCP Capital highlighted demand for short-dated Bitcoin puts in the $115,000–$118,000 range, suggesting that some market participants are protecting against a potential price drop. At the same time, there has been continued short-call covering, indicating reduced willingness to bet against further gains. Aggregated Bitcoin options open interest stands at $43 billion, close to the $49 billion peak recorded in July. The firm expects implied volatility to remain elevated until the CPI release, after which it could compress if Bitcoin fails to break through resistance levels. Ethereum options activity is similarly strong, with open interest at $13.9 billion, the highest level so far in 2025 and approaching the all-time high of $14.6 billion set in March 2024. Elevated open interest in both BTC and ETH suggests that traders are heavily engaged in positioning around macroeconomic events, with the CPI print seen as a key catalyst for short-term price action. Institutional Flows and Longer-Term Outlook Beyond derivatives markets, institutional activity and flows into spot ETFs remain a focal point for analysts. CoinShares data shows that digital asset investment products saw $571 million in net inflows last week, driven by gains in both Bitcoin and Ethereum. QCP Capital noted that the market has absorbed recent large-scale sales from long-term holders without a breakdown in price trends, indicating resilience in market structure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Strong Near All-Time High – Market Not Overheated Yet, Data Shows Despite short-term uncertainty, some analysts maintain a bullish view for the remainder of the year. Paul Howard, Senior Director at Wincent, reiterated his forecast of $150,000 for Bitcoin before year-end, citing historical post-halving cycle trends. Howard noted that historically, post-halving years have seen significant rallies, adding that while there may be periods of consolidation, the overall market structure suggests higher prices are achievable in 2025.

49948047,553691,1754964032,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49948047.jpeg,BitMine Reveals $5 Billion Ethereum Stash After Topping 1 Million ETH,https://bitcoinist.com/bitmine-reveals-5-billion-ethereum-stash-after-topping-1-million-eth/,"BitMine Immersion Technologies Inc. shares jumped this week after a steep rally on Friday, and traders kept the momentum into Monday. According to company disclosures , BitMine reported holding 1.15 million ETH as of August 10, with that stash valued at $4.96 billion, up from roughly 833,137 ETH and nearly $3 billion just a week earlier. Markets have reacted fast. Ethereum Momentum And Policy Push Ether’s push above $4,200 over the weekend helped fuel interest in companies linked to crypto. US President Donald Trump signed an executive order last week that opens the door for cryptocurrencies to be included in 401(k) retirement plans, and investors treated that as a bullish sign. The mix of a rising ETH price and clearer policy signals appears to have amplified demand for BitMine stock. According to BitMine, the company has focused more on accumulating ETH since late June. The jump from about 833,137 tokens to 1.15 million tokens in a single week was presented as a deliberate strategy change. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, who was recently named chairman of BitMine’s board, commented on the speed of the purchases and framed it as a win for shareholders. Those remarks helped push sentiment higher, even as some market watchers urged caution. Trading Volume And Price Action Based on reports from market trackers, BitMine shares rose 25% on Friday and were up another 9.5% in pre-market trading on Monday. At the time of publication the stock was trading around $58.53, a move that translated into heavy activity. The company climbed into the top tier of US stock trading by dollar volume, with a five-day average daily volume of $2.2 billion as of August 8 — a figure that put it roughly at number 25 on US trading lists, between Costco Wholesale Corp and Micron Technology. Risk And Verification Reports have come mainly from BitMine’s own filings and market services, so some analysts say investors should look for extra proof. On-chain wallet links, third-party audits, or independent custody confirmations would make the ETH claims easier to verify. There are also risks tied to holding a single crypto asset at scale: price drops in ETH, custody snafus, or sudden changes in sentiment could hit the company’s net asset value hard. Investors will be watching whether BitMine provides additional verification of its holdings and how Ether’s price behaves after the recent gains. Policy developments around retirement plan access to crypto will also matter, but the path from an executive order to actual 401(k) listings is not automatic. For now, BitMine’s market moment is real, the numbers are large, and both upside and downside risks look big.

This shift is pulling attention toward projects doing more than chasing short-term trends. Cold Wallet ($CWT) is making headlines with a presale that has already sold over 703 million tokens alongside a major acquisition. Hyperliquid is building within its exchange-focused framework. Bittensor is advancing in the AI and decentralization space, while XRP is back in focus with its push for regulatory clarity and institutional adoption. Each project offers a different value proposition, placing them firmly on the list of the best cryptos to buy today for unique reasons. 1. Cold Wallet: Acquisition Power, Growing Adoption, & ROI Potential Cold Wallet is operating on a larger scale than most presale projects. Its $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet signaled that this is more than just another token launch, it’s a Web3 tool with real-world application. Now combined under one brand, Cold Wallet has over 2 million active users and continues to grow. The presale structure is just as strategic. Currently in Stage 17 at $0.00998, $CWT will debut at $0.3517, giving buyers now a built-in 3,632% ROI. With 703 million tokens sold and $5.9 million raised, its 150-stage model increases the price with each step, and the pace is picking up. Cold Wallet’s appeal is tied to both return potential and real-world use. Holders can offset gas fees, access features early, and earn rewards for standard wallet activity. The timing is critical, getting in now means more tokens, more benefits, and an advantage at launch. Among the best cryptos to buy today, Cold Wallet is gaining traction while others are still finding their footing. 2. Hyperliquid: Exchange Utility with Market Traction Hyperliquid’s HYPE token is making its mark in conversations about the best cryptos to buy today due to its core function within the Hyperliquid Exchange. Trading around $37.50, HYPE powers staking and yield features that make user participation more interactive, helping maintain high trading activity. Analysts project a price range between $36 and $52, with the possibility of $60 if market momentum builds. Still, the token’s fate is closely tied to the exchange’s performance, leaving it exposed to potential operational or regulatory risks. 3. XRP: Banking on Utility & Regulation At $3.03, XRP remains one of the most discussed assets thanks to Ripple’s integration efforts with traditional finance. The introduction of RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin, alongside ongoing institutional partnerships, strengthens XRP’s image as a utility token rather than just a speculative asset. Forecasts vary widely, with targets from $5 to $7 and some suggesting over $10 if legal clarity comes through. However, challenges remain, from unresolved legal matters to potential competition from central bank digital currencies. What keeps XRP on the list of best cryptos to buy today is its position close to the payments industry and its growing alignment with compliance-focused development. Should regulatory trends favor its trajectory, XRP could transition from uncertainty to an institutional cornerstone. 4. Bittensor: Bringing Decentralized AI Into Focus Bittensor’s TAO token is gaining recognition for its role in decentralized AI computing, a niche quickly gaining attention. Priced near $340 with a total supply of only 9.6 million, its low float contributes to both volatility and appeal. TAO rewards participants who contribute computational power to a shared AI training network, combining token economics with practical use. Predictions for 2025 range from $235 to more than $1,000, reflecting uncertainty over AI’s adoption rate and regulation. Still, TAO’s increasing presence in AI-related crypto discussions secures its place among the best cryptos to buy today, particularly for those watching long-term, infrastructure-focused opportunities. What’s Setting the Pace in This Group Each of these four projects is shaping a distinct narrative. XRP is tightening its connections to financial institutions, Bittensor is staking ground in decentralized AI, and Hyperliquid is driving engagement through its exchange model. Cold Wallet, however, is combining strategic growth with measurable progress. A major acquisition, a large and growing user base, and a presale that has already raised over $5.9 million make it stand out. While all four deserve their spots on the list of the best presale cryptos to buy today, Cold Wallet blends utility, timing, and momentum in a way that’s hard to match.

Analysts tracking XRP are pointing to a potential rally toward $5.85, which would mean gains of about 400% if momentum continues. Current charts indicate the end of a consolidation period, hinting that a renewed upward move could be on the horizon. Cardano (ADA), meanwhile, is showing quiet buying activity despite its price trailing other large-cap coins. On-chain patterns reveal steady accumulation by long-term holders, suggesting groundwork is being laid for a breakout when the broader market turns more favorable. Yet, BlockDAG (BDAG) is also making headlines, having raised over $370 million with its current presale price at $0.0276 in Batch 29. While XRP and ADA may have their moments ahead, BlockDAG’s technology mix, official partnerships, and the narrowing presale window make it a standout for those looking for immediate opportunities. XRP Price Projection: Setting Sights on $5.85 XRP market chatter has intensified after a respected analyst suggested a potential move to $5.85. Achieving this would represent a fourfold jump from current levels. The projection is not random; it is rooted in past rally behaviors and technical structures. The asset has spent significant time in a sideways range, which some traders see as a healthy pause before a bigger push. Along the way, resistance points at $2, $3, and $4 may pose hurdles, but XRP has a history of breaking through levels quickly when momentum is in full swing. Supporting factors include possible regulatory progress for Ripple and wider use of its payment systems. Combined with Bitcoin strength and a healthy altcoin trend, XRP stands out as one of the key cryptocurrencies to monitor for sustained growth. Cardano (ADA) Market Activity: Accumulation in Play Recent analysis highlights how large Cardano holders are steadily increasing their positions, even though ADA’s price performance has been subdued compared to peers. Such quiet build-up phases often precede significant moves, as they point to solid confidence in the asset’s future. Under the guidance of founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano is known for its research-driven approach and secure proof-of-stake framework. The expected expansion of its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem could add to its appeal and bring more activity to the network. On-chain statistics confirm rising accumulation, potentially setting the stage for upward movement if the crypto market shifts into a bullish phase. While currently trading within a range, ADA remains a strong candidate for attention during the next altcoin rally. BlockDAG: Presale Nears Key Milestone BlockDAG’s ongoing presale has surpassed $370 million, an achievement rarely seen before a project’s official debut. Currently in Batch 29 with coins priced at $0.0276, the project has seen early backers enjoy a 2,660% rise in their holdings since Batch 1. With the Global Launch release ending today, the urgency for entry is at its peak. This momentum is underpinned by tangible progress. BlockDAG’s hybrid blockchain and DAG setup ensures high throughput and scalability, while its EVM compatibility allows seamless smart contract deployment. The low-code smart contract builder further opens the door for developers and businesses to create and launch applications with ease. Strategic alliances with the Seattle Seawolves of Major League Rugby and the Seattle Orcas of Major League Cricket showcase practical use cases, including fan tokens and NFT-powered engagement. The X1 mobile mining app, already adopted by more than 2.5 million users worldwide, adds another layer of readiness for mass adoption. Additionally, the rollout of Dashboard V4 gives presale participants access to a realistic trading simulator, offering a preview of live trading environments. This, combined with confirmed exchange listings, positions BlockDAG among the most closely watched crypto launches this year. As today marks the close of its Global Launch offer, the combination of strong funding, advanced technology, and strategic positioning makes it a unique opportunity. Final Take Opportunities in the crypto market depend heavily on timing and positioning. For XRP, the potential path to $5.85 hinges on clearing major resistance zones and favorable market momentum. Cardano’s gradual accumulation points to a possible price lift when market sentiment shifts. BlockDAG, however, delivers a compelling mix of large-scale funding, advanced tech framework, and a narrowing purchase window at $0.0276 before its next price move. Among the top crypto coins in focus this week, XRP and ADA may offer strong medium-term prospects, but BlockDAG’s closing Global Launch phase makes it a pressing consideration for those aiming to act ahead of its next stage.

A massive $200 million Dogecoin whale purchase has set the market on fire, with SHIB and PEPE also seeing fresh price pumps. Traders are scanning the charts and comparing notes, trying to figure out which coin will keep the momentum going. While DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE are hogging headlines, some analysts are quietly pointing to a new contender that could outshine them soon — MAGACOIN FINANCE. Ranked by industry authorities as one of the top altcoins to buy 2025, it’s starting to pick up attention from traders who’ve made big moves in meme coin cycles before. Dogecoin’s $200M Whale Move Turns Heads Dogecoin hasn’t seen this kind of buying action in months. Between August 5 and 6, 2025, whales scooped up more than 1 billion DOGE — worth around $200 million — in just 48 hours. That’s not all. According to analyst Ali Martinez, another 230 million DOGE (about $46 million) was snapped up in the next 24 hours. The impact was immediate, pushing DOGE higher and fueling fresh debate over the Dogecoin price prediction for the rest of the year. Some traders are now betting on a bigger run as whale wallets keep adding to their positions. The hype is strong, but history shows whale buying can be both a blessing and a short-term volatility trigger. SHIB and PEPE Keep the Meme Coin Energy Alive It’s not just DOGE getting love this week. SHIB has rallied more than 6%, and the SHIB price forecast is trending bullish after recent burns and network updates. Over in PEPE coin news, the frog-themed token has reclaimed the $0.000012 level, jumping 11% in 24 hours. These moves are reigniting interest in meme coins with high growth potential 2025, as traders who missed earlier rallies are looking for the best crypto to buy 2025 before the next breakout wave. Both SHIB and PEPE have active communities and enough trading volume to attract big players, but seasoned investors know the biggest winners in meme coin cycles often come from fresh, early-stage plays. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Ranked Among the Top 2025 Altcoin Buys Industry analysts are now spotlighting MAGACOIN FINANCE as a rising star. It’s been ranked among the top altcoins to buy 2025, with some experts predicting it could capture significant market share from more established meme coins. What’s driving the hype? MAGACOIN has a growing online presence, a clear strategy for building its community, and a presale that’s catching the eye of investors looking for crypto coins with growth potential. Early supporters believe it could deliver standout gains in 2025, especially as more traders diversify away from older names like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE. For those seeking altcoins set to explode, MAGACOIN is gaining traction in both retail investor circles and among influencers who helped fuel previous meme coin rallies. Its mix of branding, early-stage accessibility, and social momentum puts it firmly on the watchlist for best crypto to buy 2025. Could This Week’s Real Winner Be a Newcomer? With DOGE whales making headlines, SHIB rallying, and PEPE posting double-digit gains, the meme coin sector is hotter than it’s been in weeks. But while traders chase these short-term pumps, others are locking in positions in what they believe could be the next breakout — and MAGACOIN is high on that list. If the pace of adoption continues and presale demand stays strong, MAGACOIN could emerge as one of the meme coins with high growth potential 2025 that delivers beyond the hype.

Imagine a staggering 339,175,331 USDC, equivalent to over $339 million, moving from Binance, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, to an entirely new, unidentified wallet. This monumental crypto transaction , first reported by Whale Alert, immediately captures attention, prompting questions about its purpose and the identity of the colossal Binance whale behind it. Such significant stablecoin movement often indicates major market shifts or strategic repositioning by large players, making it crucial to understand the potential implications. What Exactly Happened with This Binance Whale? Recently, Whale Alert, a renowned blockchain tracking service, flagged an enormous USDC transfer . The funds originated from a Binance wallet and were directed to an address that had no prior transaction history, meaning it’s a freshly created wallet. This kind of move is typical of a “whale”—an individual or entity holding a substantial amount of cryptocurrency—given the sheer volume involved. For context, USDC is USD Coin, a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Its stability makes it a preferred asset for large transfers, trading, and hedging against market volatility. When a Binance whale executes such a significant transfer, it signals a deliberate and high-value decision, often with broader market implications. Why Do Such Crypto Transactions Matter? Large crypto transactions , especially those involving stablecoins like USDC, are closely watched for several reasons: Market Sentiment: While stablecoins don’t typically cause price volatility, their movement can indicate a large player’s strategy. Are they preparing to buy other assets, or simply moving funds for security or operational reasons? Security Concerns: Moving such a vast sum to an “unknown new wallet” raises questions about the security protocols involved. Is it a self-custody move, or part of an over-the-counter (OTC) deal? Privacy and Transparency: Blockchain transactions are public, but the identities behind wallet addresses remain pseudonymous. This particular stablecoin movement highlights the ongoing balance between transparency and privacy in the crypto space. Understanding these large-scale transfers helps us gauge the health and direction of the broader crypto market. They represent significant capital at play, often preceding other notable activities by influential players. What Does Whale Alert Tell Us About Stablecoin Movement? Whale Alert provides invaluable insights into large blockchain movements. Their real-time reporting helps observers track significant transfers across various cryptocurrencies, including this substantial USDC transfer . For stablecoins specifically, such alerts often highlight: Institutional Activity: Large transfers could be institutional investors rebalancing portfolios, preparing for significant investments, or exiting positions. Exchange Rebalancing: Exchanges sometimes move funds between their hot and cold wallets for security or operational efficiency. However, a transfer to an “unknown new wallet” usually points away from internal exchange operations. OTC Deals: Over-the-counter trades, which bypass public exchanges, often involve direct wallet-to-wallet transfers of large sums, maintaining privacy for the parties involved. This particular stablecoin movement is intriguing because it involves a fresh, unidentifiable destination. It suggests a new holder or a new strategic location for these significant funds, making the crypto community curious about the next steps of this prominent Binance whale . What Are the Potential Implications of This USDC Transfer? While the immediate impact of a stablecoin transfer on market prices is minimal, the long-term implications of such a substantial USDC transfer can be noteworthy. Firstly, it underscores the liquidity and scalability of the USDC network, capable of handling hundreds of millions of dollars seamlessly. Secondly, it reiterates the significant capital held by individual or institutional “whales” within the ecosystem. We might see this capital deployed into other cryptocurrencies, used for large-scale DeFi activities, or simply held off-exchange for secure long-term storage. The move also highlights the continuous need for robust security practices, whether you are a small investor or a massive Binance whale . Every crypto transaction , regardless of size, carries a degree of risk and requires careful management. In conclusion, the transfer of over $339 million in USDC from Binance to an unknown wallet is more than just a large number; it’s a fascinating glimpse into the high-stakes world of cryptocurrency movements. This significant USDC transfer , brought to light by Whale Alert, underscores the dynamic nature of the digital asset space and the powerful influence of large holders.

In 2025, this corner of crypto is thriving more than ever, with coins pulling in massive communities, creating global buzz, and generating life-changing returns for early backers. Among the crowd, a new wave of coins is reshaping the game, blending entertainment with real opportunity. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), Dogecoin (DOGE), Keyboard Cat (KEYCAT), Apu Apustaja (APU), and Gigachad (GIGA) are some of the most talked-about names in this year’s meme coin conversation. Arctic Pablo Coin, in particular, is rewriting the script. Its ongoing presale isn’t just about grabbing tokens; it’s an invitation into a wild, story-driven expedition that bridges myth and reality. With its adventurous backstory, high-yield staking, and deflationary tokenomics, APC is creating a wealth-generation opportunity that rivals even the most legendary meme coins of the past. For anyone searching for the top new meme coin to invest in now, APC is quickly becoming the headline act of 2025’s meme coin frenzy. 1. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) – The Mythical Adventure That’s Turning into a Wealth Magnet What if a cryptocurrency wasn’t just a token but a ticket to a grand, unfolding legend? Arctic Pablo Coin has set itself apart by weaving its identity into a captivating storyline. The character, Arctic Pablo, is not just a mascot — he’s an explorer racing across frozen landscapes, unlocking hidden corners of Earth that hold shimmering $APC coins. These coins aren’t just designed for trading; they represent a share in an imaginative, community-driven journey. Every investor becomes part of the mission to bridge myth and reality, with each presale stage revealing a new destination in the Arctic Pablo saga. Underneath the fun lies serious utility. APC offers a generous 66% Annual Percentage Yield for staking, rewarding holders who choose to back the mission long-term. Its tokenomics ensure scarcity with weekly burns of unsold presale tokens and an additional burn after the presale ends. Capped at a total supply of 221.2 billion, every token carries built-in scarcity that could drive future value. This mix of rich storytelling, rewarding staking, and deflationary mechanics gives Arctic Pablo Coin the kind of depth rarely seen in meme coins — making it a prime pick for those looking for more than just hype. The Arctic Pablo Meme Coin Presale – Where Adventure Meets Profit Right now, Arctic Pablo Coin’s journey is deep into its 36th stage, Horizon Haven, with each phase bringing investors closer to the climactic listing. Tokens are selling at $0.0008, with over $3.34 million already raised. At the end of this meme coin presale , the listing price is set at $0.008 — a jump that translates to a 900% return from this stage alone. Analysts are even more bullish, forecasting a potential climb to $0.1 per coin, which would mean a jaw-dropping 12,400% return from today’s price. To put that in perspective, an investment of $15,000 right now would buy 18,750,000 APC tokens. At the $0.008 listing price, that stack would be worth $150,000 by the end of the presale. And if the analyst predictions hit their mark at $0.1, the same holding could balloon to $1.875 million. Factor in the weekly burn of unsold tokens during the presale, and the scarcity effect only adds fuel to the fire. For investors seeking the top new meme coin to invest in now , this high-potential meme coin presale is an opportunity that’s as much about the thrill of the ride as it is about the potential rewards. 2. Dogecoin (DOGE) – The Original Meme Coin That Started It All Dogecoin remains the most recognized name in the meme coin universe. Born as a joke in 2013, it has since evolved into a cryptocurrency with a loyal global following and real-world payment integrations. Recently, Dogecoin has been gaining renewed attention thanks to developments in merchant adoption and integration into new platforms, particularly in tipping and microtransactions. Its ability to stay culturally relevant and adapt to new use cases is why Dogecoin continues to hold a spot among meme coin heavyweights. That adaptability is exactly why Dogecoin earns its place in this list. 3. Keyboard Cat (KEYCAT) – Nostalgia Meets Blockchain Keyboard Cat taps into internet nostalgia while leveraging blockchain trends. Inspired by the viral meme that has entertained millions, KEYCAT has created a niche by building a playful brand that appeals to both meme lovers and crypto traders. Its focus on interactive community events and NFT integrations has kept it in conversations well beyond its launch. By blending cultural throwbacks with modern crypto tools, KEYCAT has managed to carve a sustainable space in the meme coin market. That clever mix of nostalgia and tech is why Keyboard Cat is part of this list. 4. Apu Apustaja (APU) – The Community-First Challenger Apu Apustaja, known for its roots in online culture, has built a name on the strength of its tight-knit community. The project has recently expanded into more creative marketing campaigns, leveraging its meme heritage to keep momentum high. APU’s roadmap has started integrating gamified staking rewards and themed digital collectibles, giving holders more reasons to stay engaged. This combination of culture and utility ensures Apu Apustaja maintains relevance. That unique balance is why APU has made it onto this list. 5. Gigachad (GIGA) – The Meme Coin of Unstoppable Confidence Gigachad capitalizes on one of the internet’s most recognizable meme personas, projecting strength and dominance in its branding. Beyond the image, GIGA has been focusing on community engagement through social challenges and collaborative marketing efforts. The project has also been testing early NFT drops tied to meme culture, creating additional value streams for holders. This confident brand identity, paired with an active community, is why Gigachad deserves a spot in this roundup. Conclusion Every so often, a project comes along that doesn’t just join the meme coin conversation — it flips the tone entirely. Arctic Pablo Coin is doing precisely that, merging a cinematic backstory with tokenomics built for serious profit potential. This isn’t about watching charts in silence; it’s about being part of an unfolding expedition where every presale stage adds to the plot and tightens the supply. With the clock ticking on the current stage, those who step in now are locking in a price point that could look laughably low in hindsight. Weekly burns, high-yield staking, and a community fueled by the thrill of discovery are creating a rare setup. For anyone searching for the top new meme coin to invest in now, this is the point in the story where joining Arctic Pablo’s icy trail could turn into the kind of chapter worth bragging about for years.

Analysts are talking about targets such as 0.24, 0.30, and even 0.38. Technical indicators are also on an upward trend, with the RSI at 50. Yet, this rally pales against the explosive growth of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is dominating the 2025’s most promising altcoins conversation. Its ongoing presale success highlights a fundamental shift toward utility-driven projects. Investors are increasingly favoring tokens with real-world applications over pure meme appeal. Consequently, MUTM’s structured financial ecosystem is attracting significant capital. This trend underscores why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing serious crypto investment interest now. Dogecoin (DOGE): rally faces long-term utility questions Dogecoin (DOGE) is rallying on technical signals and renewed market optimism. Trading volume has jumped 26%, reaching $1.71 billion. Support levels have held firm, fueling short-term bullish crypto predictions. Nevertheless, Dogecoin (DOGE) remains to have no inherent value other than being a meme. It has a long-term value proposition that is founded on the social sentiment and celebrity endorsements. Moreover, to reach the legendary $1 price target, the demand has to be unprecedented and sustained. Market metrics show interest, yet Dogecoin (DOGE) faces inherent volatility risks common among meme coins. Many investors now seek assets with stronger fundamentals and revenue models. Therefore, despite current gains, Dogecoin (DOGE) struggles to match the promise of newer DeFi entrants. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): presale success and robust framework Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is currently in Phase 6, selling tokens at $0.035. This cost is a 250 percent increase from its initial offering of $0.01. Phase 6 is underway, and the following phase is expected to increase the price by 14.3 percent to 0.04. The investors who have bought MUTM at this time expect to make profits of more than 400 percent at the initial price of MUTM, which is 0.06 dollars. The project already has funding of 14,300,000. More than 670 million tokens have been sold to 15,100 holders. This strong uptake signals immense confidence in Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s vision. Moreover, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not merely riding hype; its value stems from tangible utility within decentralized finance. Dual lending model and security assurance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a revolutionary peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform. This dual model offers lenders flexible avenues for generating yield. P2C lending provides stability with assets like BTC or ETH, targeting predictable returns. Conversely, P2P enables higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities using assets like memecoins. Security is paramount; Mutuum Finance (MUTM) successfully finalized its CertiK smart contract audit. CertiK awarded a stellar 95.00 security score, confirming robust protocol integrity. No critical vulnerabilities were identified during the rigorous assessment. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched an official Bug Bounty Program via CertiK. A $50,000 USDT reward pool incentivizes ethical hackers to find flaws, categorized into critical, major, minor, and low tiers. Community growth and future outlook Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fostering significant community engagement. A new dashboard includes a leaderboard tracking the top 50 token holders. These leading participants earn bonus tokens, encouraging long-term holding. Furthermore, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is running a massive $100,000 MUTM token giveaway . Ten fortunate winners will each receive $10,000. Participation requires submitting a valid wallet address and completing specific quests. Crucially, entrants need a minimum $50 investment in the ongoing MUTM presale. Post-launch, analysts project substantial growth for MUTM, potentially reaching between $1 and $5 based on its fixed 4 billion token supply and platform adoption. This outlook makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a standout crypto investment for 2025. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) leads 2025’s altcoin charge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) clearly demonstrates stronger fundamentals and momentum than Dogecoin (DOGE). Its successful $14.3 million presale, innovative lending utility, and top-tier security measures provide a compelling foundation. The current Phase 6 price of $0.035 offers a final low-entry point before the next increase. Investors seeking promising altcoins with real growth potential should evaluate Mutuum Finance (MUTM) immediately.

Comparing 2025 potential for SOL and MUTM,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/12/best-cryptos-to-buy-comparing-2025-potential-for-sol-and-mutm/,"Identifying the best cryptos to buy now requires examining projects demonstrating tangible momentum and utility. Solana (SOL) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) present distinct opportunities within the crypto market for 2025, each attracting significant crypto investment. Let’s explore their current positions and future prospects. Solana (SOL): riding institutional validation Solana is experiencing renewed investor interest following a major announcement. Its value has increased by 4.28 percent in the recent past to stand at $174.33. This boom is a direct result of the decision of Visa. Because of this, Visa is extending its stablecoin settlement program to the Solana blockchain. This move critically validates Solana’s technical strengths, particularly its speed and low transaction costs. Moreover, institutional activity surrounding Solana is intensifying. Futures trading volume for SOL skyrocketed 252% in July, hitting $8.1 billion. Simultaneously, the Solana Foundation released its second-generation blockchain smartphone, Seeker. This development expands Solana’s reach beyond DeFi and NFTs. Technical indicators currently offer a mixed view, however. The RSI sits neutrally at 52.29. Resistance is evident near the 20-day SMA at $178.23. A break above this level could signal stronger bullish momentum. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): presale momentum and robust infrastructure Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a compelling early-stage crypto investment opportunity. It’s ongoing presale demonstrates remarkable traction. Currently in Phase 6, tokens are priced attractively at $0.035. This price reflects a substantial 250% increase from the opening phase. Phase 6 is progressing swiftly, selling out rapidly. Consequently, the window for acquiring tokens at this level is closing. Afterwards, Phase 7 commences, introducing a 14.3% price hike to $0.04. The project launch price is firmly set at $0.06. Therefore, current Phase 6 participants stand to realize significant gains post-launch. Investor confidence is clearly reflected in the numbers. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has impressively raised $14,300,000 since its presale began. Over 670 million tokens have already been sold. Total MUTM holders now exceed 15,100 individuals. This robust participation underscores strong market belief. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) core utility: lending innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is constructing a decentralized lending ecosystem. It uniquely integrates Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models. The P2C model allows tokenizing assets like ETH or BTC, generating yield. Conversely, the P2P model facilitates direct negotiations between users, often involving higher-yield memecoins. Furthermore, the protocol plans an overcollateralized stablecoin system. This stablecoin mints only during loans and burns upon repayment. Consequently, it aims for a stable $1 peg without inflationary pressures. Operating on Layer-2 technology is another key advantage. This integration drastically reduces transaction fees while boosting speed. Such efficiency makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) accessible to a wider user base. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) security and community initiatives Security remains paramount for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The project team has successfully finalized its Certik audit. Certik’s evaluation awarded a 95.00 security score, indicating a solid security posture. Importantly, no vulnerabilities were detected in the audited smart contract. Moreover, no security incidents have occurred within the past 90 days. Complementing this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launched an official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. A substantial $50,000 USDT reward pool exists. Rewards are tiered based on vulnerability severity: critical, major, minor, and low. Positioning for potential growth Solana (SOL) offers exposure to established institutional adoption and payment integration. Its recent Visa partnership is undoubtedly significant. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), however, presents a unique early-access proposition through its advanced presale phase. Its unique lending designs, security credentials, Layer-2 performance, and community efforts make a convincing argument. The analysts predict that the potential of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is between 1 and 5 after the launch, which is a substantial upside potential in comparison to the presale price. A high level of investor confidence is reflected in the presale momentum, with more than 14.3 million raised and the speed of token sales. For investors seeking high-potential assets, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Phase 6 offers a timely entry point before the next price increase. Examine the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale details today.

While Ethereum and XRP are viewed as long-term infrastructure plays, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being compared to Solana in its pre-breakout days, sparking a rush before its presale closes. Ethereum Eyes $60,000 Target Amid Institutional Build-Up BitMine Immersion Technologies has stunned the market with a $60,000 Ethereum price projection, citing valuations from multiple research firms. Using a “replacement value” model comparing Ethereum to Wall Street’s payment and settlement infrastructure, analysts see the network potentially worth $7 trillion, an 18x jump from its current ~$0.4 trillion market cap. ETH’s dominance in the stablecoin sector (hosting over 60% of supply) and its role in asset tokenization bolster this case. BitMine’s aggressive treasury strategy, mirroring MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin playbook, has already grown its ETH holdings to 600,000, worth $2.7 billion in just 18 days, cementing Ethereum as a foundational layer for future finance. XRP Bold $10,000 Scenario Gains Traction Discussions around XRP’s long-term value exploded after Jake Claver argued that the token is effectively “programmed” to reach $10,000. His reasoning draws on liquidity efficiency: as XRP’s price rises, fewer tokens are needed to move the same value, enabling larger institutional transfers. Ripple CTO David Schwartz’s example illustrates this: moving $1 million at $1 per XRP requires 1M tokens, but at $10 per XRP only 100K are needed. At $10,000 per coin, XRP could theoretically support trillion-dollar transactions with ease. Claver’s ambitious timeline suggests this milestone could arrive within just two years, driven by the token’s built-in scalability. MAGACOIN FINANCE Echoes Solana’s Pre-Breakout Moment MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing comparisons to Solana’s early days, but with an even stronger foundation: full community ownership, security audits, and explosive wallet growth (+420% MoM). With over 12,000 holders and $11.7M+ raised in its presale, analysts believe MAGACOIN could follow — or exceed — Solana’s trajectory once exchange listings go live. Its early metrics already rival PEPE and SHIB, but with a more robust structure designed for long-term momentum. The Window Is Closing Ethereum’s institutional build-up, XRP’s efficiency-driven valuation model, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Solana-like setup all point to a convergence of opportunity. While ETH and XRP have multi-year roadmaps, MAGACOIN’s presale offers immediate early positioning before potential CEX and DEX listings.

The sheer volume of investment flowing into BitMine shares is truly remarkable. Data compiled by strategicethreserve.xyz confirms this substantial net purchase, positioning BitMine as the most purchased foreign security during this period, according to the Korea Securities Depository.

Market Positioning Appeal: BitMine’s dual identity as a Nasdaq-listed entity and a prominent Bitcoin miner likely appeals to investors seeking exposure to crypto through regulated, traditional stock markets. This offers a perceived layer of security and familiarity. Enhanced Transparency: Being listed on a major exchange provides a level of transparency and regulatory oversight that can significantly reassure investors, making Bitcoin mining stock a more approachable investment. Moreover, the ease of access through established brokerage platforms in South Korea has likely facilitated this substantial inflow of funds into foreign securities like BitMine. BitMine’s Strategic Edge: A Massive Ethereum Treasury Beyond its core Bitcoin mining stock operations, BitMine possesses an asset that truly sets it apart: an enormous Ethereum treasury . The company currently holds over 1.15 million ETH. This substantial holding is valued at an impressive $4.96 billion, establishing BitMine as the largest corporate Ethereum treasury globally. This strategic accumulation of Ethereum provides several key advantages and makes the company particularly attractive to those interested in the wider crypto ecosystem. Asset Diversification: Holding significant ETH alongside its primary Bitcoin mining operations effectively diversifies BitMine’s asset base, reducing reliance on a single cryptocurrency’s performance. Compelling Value Proposition: The substantial Ethereum holdings offer a compelling value proposition, attracting investors who are keen on Ethereum’s long-term potential and its role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT sectors. Potential Market Influence: Such a large and liquid treasury could potentially give BitMine a unique strategic position and influence within the broader crypto ecosystem, opening future opportunities. This dual-asset strategy allows BitMine to potentially benefit from both Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative and Ethereum’s ecosystem growth. Understanding the Broader Appeal of Crypto Investments The significant investment in BitMine shares by South Korean investors underscores a broader, global trend: the increasing mainstream acceptance and appeal of crypto investments .

On-chain analysis points to Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin mining firm BitMine Immersion as the likely Ethereum whale behind this colossal acquisition. This significant move, involving 293,186 ETH, occurred over eight days through major platforms like FalconX, Galaxy Digital, and BitGo. This suggests a calculated and substantial institutional ETH acquisition , sparking widespread discussion about the future of crypto investments. What’s Behind This Unprecedented BitMine ETH Purchase? On-chain analyst @EmberCN, citing Arkham data, first highlighted these significant movements. The data strongly suggests that the addresses involved are connected to BitMine Immersion. This isn’t the company’s first foray into substantial Ethereum holdings; just last week, BitMine announced an additional purchase of 317,000 ETH. This latest acquisition brings their total reported large ETH holdings to an astonishing 1.15 million ETH. Such consistent, large-scale buying by a publicly traded entity underscores a strategic shift or diversification within their asset portfolio. Understanding the mechanisms behind such a transaction is key. Utilizing over-the-counter (OTC) desks like FalconX and Galaxy Digital, along with custody solutions like BitGo, allows for the execution of massive trades without significantly impacting market prices. This method is typical for large institutional players seeking to acquire or divest substantial amounts of cryptocurrency discreetly. Why Are Institutions Making Such Large ETH Holdings? The decision by a Bitcoin mining firm, traditionally focused on BTC, to accumulate such significant amounts of Ethereum is highly noteworthy. There are several compelling reasons why an entity like BitMine Immersion might pursue an institutional ETH acquisition : Diversification: Spreading risk across different digital assets can strengthen a portfolio. Ethereum, with its robust ecosystem for DeFi, NFTs, and dApps, offers distinct growth potential separate from Bitcoin. Staking Yields: Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake allows holders to earn staking rewards, providing a passive income stream on their large ETH holdings . This can be an attractive financial incentive for institutional investors. Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform. Investing in ETH provides exposure to the vast and continuously expanding decentralized economy built upon it. Future Prospects: Many analysts project strong long-term growth for Ethereum due to ongoing network upgrades and increasing adoption of its underlying technology. What Does This Institutional ETH Acquisition Mean for the Market? A BitMine ETH purchase of this magnitude carries significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. Firstly, it signals increasing institutional confidence in Ethereum as a legitimate and valuable asset beyond Bitcoin. This could encourage other traditional and crypto-native institutions to consider similar investments, potentially driving further demand for ETH. Moreover, the sheer volume of this acquisition could contribute to upward price pressure on Ethereum. While OTC trades aim to minimize market impact, the removal of such a large supply from public exchanges naturally tightens availability. This consistent accumulation by an Ethereum whale like BitMine suggests a long-term bullish outlook, which can positively influence market sentiment among retail and institutional investors alike. Tracking the Ethereum Whale: Transparency in On-Chain Data The ability to identify and track such massive movements, like this recent BitMine ETH purchase , highlights the power and transparency of on-chain analytics. Platforms like Arkham Intelligence provide invaluable insights into blockchain activity, allowing analysts to piece together narratives from public data. This level of transparency is unique to the crypto space, offering a window into the strategies of major players and contributing to a more informed market. The meticulous work of on-chain analysts like @EmberCN is crucial in uncovering these large-scale transactions. Their ability to connect dots between addresses and real-world entities provides a deeper understanding of market dynamics and the evolving landscape of institutional crypto adoption. This continuous monitoring helps everyone stay informed about significant capital flows and potential market shifts driven by entities with large ETH holdings . In conclusion, the suspected BitMine Immersion acquisition of over $1.24 billion in Ethereum is a compelling narrative of institutional foresight and diversification. It underscores the growing appeal of Ethereum beyond its foundational role as a smart contract platform, positioning it as a strategic asset for significant capital deployment. As more traditional firms explore digital assets, such moves by publicly traded companies will likely become more common, reshaping the future of the crypto market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is BitMine Immersion? BitMine Immersion is a Nasdaq-listed company primarily known as a Bitcoin mining firm. Their recent activities suggest a strategic diversification into other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. Q2: How much Ethereum (ETH) did BitMine Immersion reportedly acquire? According to on-chain analysis, BitMine Immersion is likely behind the acquisition of 293,186 ETH, valued at approximately $1.24 billion. This brings their total reported large ETH holdings to 1.15 million ETH. Q3: Why is this large ETH purchase by BitMine Immersion significant? This acquisition is significant because it represents a substantial institutional ETH acquisition by a publicly traded company, signaling growing confidence in Ethereum. It also highlights a trend of diversification among crypto firms and could influence market sentiment and ETH’s price. Q4: How was this BitMine ETH purchase identified? On-chain analysts, specifically @EmberCN, used data from platforms like Arkham Intelligence to track the movements of funds from major OTC desks (FalconX, Galaxy Digital) and custodians (BitGo) to addresses linked to BitMine Immersion. Q5: What are the potential implications for Ethereum’s price? While OTC trades aim to minimize immediate market impact, such a massive BitMine ETH purchase by an Ethereum whale can create long-term upward price pressure by reducing available supply and boosting overall market confidence in Ethereum’s value proposition. Q6: Does this mean other Bitcoin miners will buy ETH? This specific institutional ETH acquisition by BitMine Immersion could inspire other Bitcoin mining firms to consider diversifying their portfolios. However, each company’s strategy will depend on its financial goals, risk tolerance, and market outlook. If you found this analysis insightful, share it with your network!

This development prompts investors and enthusiasts to pay close attention to the movements of large holders, as their actions often foreshadow broader market shifts. Understanding these patterns is crucial for anyone navigating the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, especially concerning Solana price impact . What’s Behind These Major SOL Whale Movements ? On-chain analytics platform Lookonchain recently reported on X about three distinct whale addresses that appear to have initiated substantial transfers of SOL to various exchanges. These movements are typically interpreted as a strong signal of an intent to sell, which could potentially influence Solana’s market dynamics and overall Solana market trends . Address CMJiHu: This address made a massive deposit of 96,996 SOL (approximately $17.45 million) to exchanges. This transfer occurred about nine hours prior to the report, indicating a swift move. Address 5PjMxa: Another significant transfer involved 91,890 SOL (roughly $15.98 million), which was deposited to Kraken. This transaction took place three hours before the report, signaling another large-scale move and contributing to the observed SOL selling activity . Address HiN7sS: This whale deposited 37,658 SOL (worth about $6.73 million) to Binance. Notably, this particular address realized a profit of $1.63 million from this specific transaction, which happened eight hours before the report. While deposits to exchanges are generally seen as a precursor to selling, it is important to remember that not all such transfers definitively result in immediate sales. However, the sheer volume of these large SOL transactions certainly warrants careful observation for their potential Solana price impact . How Do Large SOL Transactions Influence Solana’s Price? When significant amounts of a cryptocurrency like SOL are moved to exchanges by whales, it can create a supply overhang. This increased supply, if met with insufficient demand, could exert downward pressure on the asset’s price. The market often reacts to these large-scale crypto whale movements , as they can signal a shift in sentiment among major holders. The collective action of these three addresses, totaling over 226,000 SOL, represents a substantial amount that could impact Solana’s valuation. Such large-scale transfers can trigger speculative trading and influence short-term price volatility, directly affecting the Solana price impact . Traders and investors closely monitor these on-chain metrics to gauge potential market direction and adjust their strategies accordingly, staying ahead of developing Solana market trends . Navigating Current Solana Market Trends : What Should Investors Consider? For those invested in or considering Solana, understanding these ongoing Solana market trends is paramount. While whale activity can be a strong indicator, it is only one piece of the puzzle. Other factors, such as broader market sentiment, technological developments within the Solana ecosystem, and macroeconomic indicators, also play crucial roles in determining long-term value beyond immediate SOL selling activity . Actionable Insights for Investors: Stay Informed: Regularly check on-chain data and reliable crypto news sources for updates on whale movements and exchange flows. Understanding these crypto whale movements can provide an edge. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid over-reliance on a single asset. Diversifying your investments can help mitigate risks associated with sudden market shifts and unexpected Solana price impact . Implement Risk Management: Use tools like stop-loss orders and define clear entry and exit strategies to protect your investments during periods of increased volatility. Distinguish Short-Term from Long-Term: Differentiate between short-term price fluctuations caused by whale activity and the long-term fundamentals and growth potential of the Solana project. The recent SOL selling activity serves as a reminder of the dynamic nature of the crypto markets. While these whale movements indicate potential selling pressure, the overall resilience and ongoing innovation within the Solana ecosystem will be key determinants of its future trajectory. In Summary: The recent deposits of substantial SOL amounts by three whale addresses to exchanges signal potential selling pressure, prompting close observation of Solana’s market. These significant crypto whale movements highlight the importance of monitoring on-chain data to anticipate market shifts and manage investment risks effectively, especially concerning the potential Solana price impact and evolving Solana market trends . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does “SOL selling activity” by whales mean? A1: “SOL selling activity” by whales refers to large cryptocurrency holders (whales) moving significant amounts of Solana (SOL) from their private wallets to centralized exchanges, which is often interpreted as an intention to sell these assets. Q2: How can I track crypto whale movements? A2: You can track crypto whale movements using on-chain analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Whale Alert, or Nansen, which monitor large transactions and provide insights into significant wallet activity. Q3: Do all whale deposits to exchanges result in sales? A3: No, not all whale deposits to exchanges definitively result in immediate sales. While it’s a strong indicator of selling intent, whales might also move funds for other reasons, such as liquidity provision or rebalancing portfolios. Q4: What is the potential Solana price impact of these large transactions? A4: Large SOL transactions moved to exchanges can increase the available supply, potentially leading to downward pressure on Solana’s price if demand does not match the increased supply. This can cause short-term volatility and affect the Solana price impact . Q5: How can investors react to these Solana market trends? A5: Investors can react by staying informed with on-chain data, diversifying their portfolios, implementing robust risk management strategies (like stop-loss orders), and distinguishing between short-term price fluctuations and Solana’s long-term fundamentals.

US District Judge Paul Engelmayer has scheduled a change of plea hearing for Tuesday 10:30 am in Manhattan federal court. In an order on Monday, the judge directed Kwon to be ready to explain in detail how he broke the law if he admits guilt. The 33-year-old South Korean entrepreneur had pleaded not guilty in January after a prolonged extradition dispute over whether he would first be prosecuted in the US or in South Korea. Montenegro Arrest Capped Months-Long International Manhunt Both countries have charged Kwon in connection with the implosion of TerraUSD, a Singapore-based algorithmic stablecoin designed to maintain a one-to-one peg to the US dollar through a mint-and-burn mechanism with its sister token Luna. Do Kwon Update: The plea hearing is tomorrow August 12th. Do Kwon was extradited to the United States from Montenegro on December 31, 2024. He initially pleaded not guilty to nine felony counts, including securities fraud, market manipulation, money laundering, and wire fraud.… pic.twitter.com/TJTPmCAATB — MartyParty (@martypartymusic) August 11, 2025 That mechanism failed in May 2022, causing TerraUSD to lose its peg and triggering a market crash that contributed to the downfall of crypto exchange FTX. The collapse erased billions in investor wealth and damaged confidence in digital asset markets. Kwon was a fugitive for months before he and Terraform’s former chief financial officer, Han Chang-joon, were arrested in Montenegro in March 2023 while attempting to board a Dubai-bound private jet using fake passports. He spent months in detention as Montenegro weighed competing extradition requests from Washington and Seoul. Kwon’s 92% Stake Reflects Personal Ties to Firm’s Collapse The US SEC had already won a civil fraud case against Kwon and Terraform in April 2024. Moreover, a New York jury found they misled investors about the stability of TerraUSD. The jury also concluded they falsely claimed that Chai, a popular Korean payments app, was using Terraform’s blockchain for transactions. Under a settlement, Kwon and Terraform agreed to pay $4.47b. In addition, they committed to winding down operations . They also pledged to use remaining assets to repay creditors. Notably, Kwon personally owned 92% of the company. In the US criminal case, Kwon had faced a nine-count indictment including securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud,and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Judge Engelmayer has instructed the defendant’s legal team to prepare a detailed statement covering each charge Kwon plans to admit. Guilty Plea Could Shape US and South Korea Prosecutions Court documents suggest the plea deal could streamline proceedings in the US. However, it may also influence ongoing investigations in South Korea. There, Kwon faces separate fraud and financial misconduct charges under capital markets laws. If accepted, the guilty plea would mark a dramatic turn in one of the most high-profile prosecutions in the crypto sector. It would also close a chapter on a saga that has spanned continents, courtrooms and regulatory jurisdictions. The outcome of Kwon’s case could set important precedents for how international crypto fraud is prosecuted in the future.

U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recently experienced a significant surge, recording a combined net inflow of $178.99 million on August 11. This remarkable achievement marks the fourth consecutive day of positive inflows, signaling growing confidence and interest in these investment vehicles. For those tracking Bitcoin investment trends, this consistent momentum highlights a maturing market. What’s Driving the Astounding Momentum in U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs? On August 11, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessed a substantial injection of capital, totaling $178.99 million. This figure, reported by Trader T on X, extends a positive streak that began days prior. The sustained interest in Bitcoin ETF inflows suggests a deeper trend at play beyond mere daily fluctuations. Growing Institutional Confidence: Major financial institutions are increasingly comfortable allocating capital to digital assets. Accessibility: Spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a regulated and familiar pathway for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Market Maturation: The consistent inflows reflect a broader acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. This trend is crucial for the overall crypto market, indicating robust demand from a diverse range of investors. Key Players Shaping Bitcoin ETF Inflows Several prominent funds contributed significantly to the recent Bitcoin ETF inflows . BlackRock’s IBIT led the pack, demonstrating its strong market presence.

These figures illustrate a broad-based positive sentiment across multiple providers of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs . The Broader Impact of Sustained Spot Bitcoin ETF Adoption The consistent stream of Bitcoin ETF inflows holds significant implications for the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem. This isn’t just about daily numbers; it reflects a fundamental shift in how large-scale investors view and access digital assets. Market Validation: Sustained inflows provide validation for Bitcoin as a stable and attractive investment vehicle. Increased Liquidity: More capital flowing into these ETFs enhances market liquidity for Bitcoin itself. Paving the Way: The success of spot Bitcoin ETF products could encourage the development and approval of other crypto ETF products, potentially including those for Ethereum or other major cryptocurrencies. Mainstream Integration: As traditional financial products, these ETFs bridge the gap between conventional finance and the digital asset space, fostering greater mainstream integration of Bitcoin investment .

The Chainlink Reserve is a new on-chain vault designed to buy and store LINK tokens using fees from enterprise and decentralized application clients. Instead of selling those service payments, the reserve converts assets like ETH or USDC into LINK and locks them away for years. This mechanism effectively reduces circulating supply, adding a steady source of buying pressure to the market. For traders positioning for the next big move before the market surge , that’s a bullish combo. It’s also a strong signal to institutions that Chainlink’s network is becoming a backbone for blockchain-based financial services. With the token recently breaking out from an ascending triangle formation, analysts see potential targets ranging from $26 in the short term to as high as $88 if adoption and sentiment continue to align. And while large-cap leaders are holding strong, smaller-cap contenders like MAGACOIN FINANCE are starting to pop up on traders’ watchlists. Ethereum and Cardano Keep the Uptrend Alive Ethereum (ETH) remains one of the most important market indicators right now. After surging past $4,000, ETH has maintained its position on the back of ETF inflows, growing corporate treasury adoption, and expanding DeFi activity. Technically, $3,950–$4,000 is now a key support zone, and a sustained push above $4,100 could open the door to much higher price targets later this year. Cardano (ADA) is making headlines for a different reason: governance. The community recently approved a $71 million allocation from its on-chain treasury to fund major upgrades. These upgrades aim to make Cardano faster, more interoperable with other blockchains, and more appealing to developers. The result? ADA has rebounded from its August lows, climbing back toward the $0.80 mark. Analysts note that a break above $0.82 could set up a run toward $1.20 or even $1.50, especially if the broader market maintains bullish momentum. Big Wallets Are Quietly Shifting Toward High-ROI Tokens While big names like LINK, ETH, and ADA continue to hold their ground, the real buzz is starting to build in the small-cap corner of the market. Blockchain data shows some of the biggest Bitcoin and XRP whales quietly moving into earlier-stage projects — a classic sign they’re hunting for the next breakout before everyone else catches on. One name that keeps popping up in these wallet inflows is MAGACOIN FINANCE. It’s been getting tagged as one of the best crypto tokens for high-ROI investors, and the pitch is compelling: audited smart contracts, climbing liquidity, and a supply that’s drying up fast. But this isn’t your run-of-the-mill meme token. It’s a meme-powered governance coin with real utility baked in, merging cultural branding with functional use cases. Analysts have even tossed around potential return figures of 14,500%, noting that in past cycles, similar setups exploded when money started rotating out of the majors and into high-upside early plays. Why This Rotation Could Shape the Rest of 2025 Market history shows a recurring pattern: when top-tier assets hold their ground, traders often start taking calculated risks on smaller, faster-moving tokens. If LINK continues its breakout, ETH pushes higher, and ADA delivers on its upgrade roadmap, the setup for that kind of rotation looks stronger than ever. That’s why many seasoned traders are scanning the market right now — and why MAGACOIN FINANCE is getting so much attention. For anyone looking ahead to the next few months, it’s becoming harder to ignore as a contender for the Top Altcoin to buy before Q4 volatility shakes things up.

According to a report by Fortune, the funds will be utilized for the acquisition of WLFI, the native token of World Liberty Financial. ALT5 Sigma revealed that it intends to sell a combination of 200 million new and existing shares, directing the proceeds toward this purchase. Trump Family Ventures Deeper Into Crypto This initiative is part of a broader strategy by the Trump family to leverage the growing trend of utilizing publicly traded or blank-check companies to provide investors with greater access to cryptocurrencies. This approach gained traction thanks to figures like Michael Saylor, who transformed Strategy (previously MicroStrategy) into a cryptocurrency powerhouse by adding substantial amounts of Bitcoin (BTC) to its balance sheet. Related Reading: XRP Price Could Explode To $3.8 Amid Trend Continuation The landscape has since seen a surge of similar ventures. Beyond Bitcoin, various treasury companies have emerged for cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ETH), Sui (SUI), Binance Coin (BNB) and Ethena (ENA) each promoting their stocks as a means for traditional investors to engage with the crypto market. As part of this expansion, Zach Witkoff, the CEO of World Liberty and son of prominent businessman Steve Witkoff, will take on the role of chairman at ALT5 Sigma. Eric Trump, another son of President Donald Trump and co-founder of World Liberty, will join the board, alongside Zak Folkman, the company’s chief operating officer (COO), who will serve as a board observer. World Liberty Financial To Make Tokens Tradable This move marks the latest chapter in the Trump family’s growing involvement in cryptocurrency. In addition to World Liberty’s initiatives, Donald and Melania Trump launched their own memecoins, TRUMP and MELANIA, earlier this year. Meanwhile, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. have backed World Liberty Financial and established a Bitcoin mining operation under American Bitcoin in partnership with Hut 8.

Additionally, the holders of the WLFI token have voted overwhelmingly in favor of making their tokens tradable, a decision that could significantly influence their market value and the financial interests of the Trump family. The proposal to initiate tradability garnered an impressive 99.94% approval from approximately 20,900 votes cast. WLFI Holders expressed their motivations for supporting this move, citing anticipated price increases and a desire to align their investments with their support for Trump.

This monumental BlackRock ETHA inflow marks the largest single-day net inflow since the ETF’s inception, as highlighted by crypto analyst Trader T on X. Such a massive influx of capital into an Ethereum ETF signals growing institutional confidence and marks a pivotal moment for the broader crypto market. What’s Behind the Massive BlackRock ETHA Inflow? This record-breaking BlackRock ETHA inflow is not just a number; it represents a significant shift in how traditional finance views digital assets. BlackRock, a global investment management giant, launched ETHA to provide investors with regulated exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Accessibility: ETFs offer a familiar and accessible investment vehicle for institutional and retail investors alike. Trust: The backing of a reputable firm like BlackRock instills greater trust and credibility in the volatile crypto space. Market Demand: The sheer volume of this inflow indicates a strong underlying demand for Ethereum exposure within traditional investment portfolios. This event underscores the increasing appetite for a regulated Ethereum ETF, demonstrating that investors are eager to participate in the crypto economy through established financial products. The Impact of Institutional Crypto ETF Investment The substantial BlackRock ETHA inflow on August 11 is a powerful indicator of burgeoning institutional crypto adoption. When major players like BlackRock see such significant capital allocation into a crypto-related product, it sends a clear message to the market. This type of institutional crypto ETF investment brings several key benefits: Legitimacy: It lends further legitimacy to cryptocurrencies as a serious asset class. Liquidity: Increased institutional participation can enhance market liquidity and stability. Future Approvals: A successful spot Ethereum ETF could pave the way for more crypto ETFs and broader mainstream acceptance. This trend suggests that the digital asset market is maturing, attracting sophisticated investors who seek diversified portfolios that include exposure to innovative technologies like Ethereum. Navigating the Future of Spot Ethereum ETF What does this record BlackRock ETHA inflow mean for the future of the spot Ethereum ETF landscape? This successful launch and subsequent massive inflow could encourage other asset managers to pursue similar products. It demonstrates to regulators the strong market demand for these investment vehicles. While the path to full crypto integration into traditional finance still faces hurdles, events like this provide significant momentum. Investors should monitor: Regulatory Developments: Ongoing discussions and decisions by financial regulators. Market Performance: How these ETFs perform over time in various market conditions. New Product Launches: The emergence of additional crypto-backed financial products. The market is clearly signaling its readiness for more regulated crypto investment opportunities. Why This BlackRock ETHA Inflow Matters for Ethereum Beyond the ETF itself, the BlackRock ETHA inflow has direct implications for the Ethereum ecosystem. Ethereum, as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, powers a vast decentralized network. Increased investment through an Ethereum ETF can translate into several positives: Price Action: While not direct buying pressure on the spot market, significant inflows into an ETF can positively influence market sentiment and price discovery. Ecosystem Growth: More capital entering the Ethereum orbit can support development, innovation, and expansion of decentralized applications (dApps). Network Security: A stronger, more valued Ethereum could attract more participants to secure its network. This substantial inflow is a testament to Ethereum’s fundamental strength and its role as a cornerstone of the decentralized web. The record-breaking $640.68 million BlackRock ETHA inflow is a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. It highlights the accelerating pace of institutional crypto adoption and underscores the growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets. This event not only validates Ethereum’s position as a key player but also signals a promising future for crypto ETF investment. As traditional finance continues to embrace digital currencies, we can expect further integration and innovation in this dynamic space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is BlackRock’s ETHA? ETHA is BlackRock’s spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), which allows investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Ethereum without directly owning the cryptocurrency. Why is the $640.68 million inflow significant for BlackRock ETHA? This inflow marks the largest single-day net inflow for ETHA since its launch, indicating strong institutional and investor demand for a regulated Ethereum investment product. How does an Ethereum ETF differ from directly owning Ethereum? An Ethereum ETF is a financial product traded on traditional exchanges, while directly owning Ethereum involves holding the cryptocurrency in a digital wallet. ETFs offer regulatory oversight and ease of access for traditional investors. What impact does institutional crypto adoption have on the market? Institutional crypto adoption, like the BlackRock ETHA inflow, brings increased legitimacy, liquidity, and stability to the cryptocurrency market, potentially paving the way for broader mainstream acceptance and further innovation. Will this inflow affect Ethereum’s price? While ETF inflows do not directly purchase spot Ethereum, significant capital inflows can positively influence market sentiment, increase visibility, and indirectly impact Ethereum’s price discovery and ecosystem growth.

The report showed that total inflows reached $572 million, with activity influenced by both macroeconomic data and regulatory developments. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, noted that investor sentiment shifted significantly during the week. “Early in the week, outflows reached $1 billion, which we believe were driven by growth concerns stemming from weak US payroll figures. In the latter half of the week, however, we saw $1.57 billion of inflows, likely spurred by the government’s announcement permitting digital assets in 401(k) retirement plans,” he explained. The change in policy appears to have provided a fresh boost for institutional interest in crypto-based investment products. Regional Trends and Asset Performance The inflow activity was not evenly distributed across regions. The United States led with $608 million in net inflows, followed by Canada with $16.5 million. In contrast, Europe saw continued investor caution, as Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland recorded a combined $54.3 million in outflows. CoinShares suggested that seasonal factors, particularly the historically quieter summer trading period, contributed to an overall 23% decline in digital asset ETP trading volumes compared to the previous month. Ethereum products led the market, drawing in $268 million in inflows, the highest among all assets during the week. This pushed Ethereum’s year-to-date inflows to a record $8.2 billion, while price appreciation lifted assets under management to an all-time high of $32.6 billion, representing an 82% increase since the start of the year. The surge in interest for Ethereum-based ETPs comes amid rising activity in its network, especially within decentralized finance (DeFi) and staking ecosystems. Bitcoin also saw renewed interest after two weeks of outflows, attracting $260 million in inflows. Short Bitcoin products experienced $4 million in outflows, suggesting reduced bearish positioning among traders. Other altcoins also posted gains, with Solana bringing in $21.8 million, XRP receiving $18.4 million, and Near Protocol attracting $10.1 million. These figures indicate that while Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate inflow totals, investor appetite for select altcoins remains strong. Implications for the Market The return to positive fund flows may signal renewed institutional confidence, particularly in light of the US government’s decision to include digital assets in certain retirement plans . This policy change could open a substantial new channel of demand, given the size of the US 401(k) market. However, the regional divergence , with Europe still seeing net outflows, highlights that sentiment is far from uniform. With volumes down from the prior month and macroeconomic uncertainty still in play, the sustainability of these inflows will likely depend on broader market conditions, regulatory clarity, and the performance of major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Political changes, major tech rollouts, and renewed market interest are driving rapid shifts in digital assets. Traders and holders are now seeking projects with real potential for big price moves rather than short-lived hype. Four names stand out in the current cycle. BlockDAG is recording one of the strongest presale runs seen in years, Ethereum is benefiting from institutional access, Solana is forming bullish technical patterns, and Avalanche is positioned for a breakout. These assets are pulling in large trading volumes, strong community engagement, and expanding use cases. This breakdown explains why these are the best long-term cryptos to follow in 2025, highlighting the triggers that could make them major winners before the year ends. BlockDAG: 30x Potential from a Record-Breaking Presale Market watchers are paying close attention to BlockDAG (BDAG) as it continues to deliver headline-making results. Priced at $0.00276 in batch 29, the BDAG coin is set for a confirmed listing at $0.05 later this year, offering an estimated 30x growth opportunity. Early buyers have already seen their holdings grow by 2,660% since batch 1, showcasing remarkable early-stage gains. For anyone tracking the best long-term cryptos, BDAG stands out as a prime contender. The latest numbers strengthen this view: $370 million raised, 25 billion coins sold, and a live ecosystem already in operation. The Demo Trading Dashboard (V4) enables users to practice trading, monitor prices, and prepare strategies ahead of the launch. On top of that, the X1 mobile mining app has attracted 2.5 million users, while 19,000 ASIC miners have been sold, showing wide adoption across different user segments. With the Global Launch release ending today, this marks the final window to secure BDAG at presale levels, positioning it firmly among the best long-term cryptos in 2025. Ethereum: Strength from Institutional Access and Regulation Ethereum’s recent surge has reinforced its place in any discussion of the best long-term cryptos. The price broke past $4,000 this year, driven by a major policy shift from President Trump that permits crypto, including Ethereum, in 401(k) plans. This move has unlocked the potential for massive institutional inflows. From a trading perspective, ETH climbed from $3,450 to nearly $4,000 in days, with projections aiming for $4,145 by September and possibly $7,000 by 2026, dependent on ETF approvals and network upgrades. Institutional activity is also on the rise, with public companies increasing ETH holdings from 116,000 to over 966,000 coins, valued at $3.5 billion. This mix of market momentum and regulatory progress places Ethereum firmly among the best long-term cryptos in the current climate. Solana: Building Momentum for a Bullish Breakout Technical traders have been closely following Solana as it rebounds from a key support level near $160. The next major test lies at the $180 resistance, and a break above $200 could trigger a cup-and-handle pattern that may lead to a $1,315 mid-term target. The positive market tone from Ethereum’s rally and clearer regulations has also lifted sentiment toward Solana. Its expanding DeFi and NFT network adds further weight to its growth outlook. Although some prefer to wait for more confirmation, Solana remains one of the best long-term cryptos for those looking to capture gains if bullish conditions hold through the year. Avalanche: Poised for a Sharp Move Avalanche has been steadily preparing for a possible breakout. The coin is consolidating in a multi-year triangle formation, which could set the stage for a run toward $100 if momentum shifts in its favor. Developer activity on Avalanche remains healthy. Recent highlights, such as the Builder Spotlight with Gauthier Leonard and the Suzaku project, show continued interest from creators who seek a scalable platform for decentralized apps. With Ethereum’s performance helping lift the broader market, AVAX could benefit alongside it. These factors keep Avalanche in the conversation as one of the best long-term cryptos, offering both practical utility and technical upside for those prepared to take calculated risks. In a Nutshell Choosing the best long-term cryptos means focusing on strong fundamentals, clear technical setups, and major growth catalysts. BlockDAG is leading with unmatched presale momentum, significant ROI already realized, and an expanding ecosystem. Ethereum’s policy-driven rally opens it to unprecedented institutional flows. Solana is flashing bullish technical signals, while Avalanche’s chart pattern hints at a major move ahead. For those aiming to position themselves ahead of major price moves, these four names show the strongest potential for 2025. In a market that rewards early positioning, following these best long-term cryptos could set the stage for standout results in the months to come.

This pace is backed by more than hype. The $270 million takeover of Plus Wallet added two million active users and a built-in cashback system. Cold Wallet (CWT) is now finding its place among the top trending crypto names in the market. Litecoin (LTC) has seen a strong jump, hitting $128.40 as treasury moves and ETF talk drive a rally. The Litecoin (LTC) price surge is getting noticed across payment networks. In contrast, the Hedera (HBAR) price outlook is under pressure after a 20% drop, with weak signs and cautious sentiment keeping buyers wary. Litecoin (LTC) Price Surge Hits Highest Level in Five Months The Litecoin (LTC) price surge reached a five-month peak of $128.40 on Tuesday, fueled by ETF speculation and a large treasury purchase by MEI Pharma. Over 24 hours, Litecoin rose 5.8% to $123.60, posting 12.3% gains in the week and 41% in the month. Its market cap now stands at $9.4 billion. Analysts link MEI Pharma’s $100 million private placement to its plan to act as a Litecoin treasury company, which is seen as the main reason for the Litecoin (LTC) price surge. Polymarket puts the chance of a Litecoin ETF approval by 2025 at 80%, though XRP could arrive first. Beyond ETF news, payment data shows actual usage, with Litecoin taking 14.5% of crypto transactions last month. The Litecoin (LTC) price surge is not slowing yet. Hedera (HBAR) Price Outlook Drops After Sharp 20% Loss The Hedera (HBAR) price outlook turned negative after a 20% fall from July 23 to August 3. Technical markers like a declining MACD, RSI, and weak CMF point to higher selling pressure. The slip below the 20-day EMA on August 1 adds weight to the short-term downtrend. HBAR now trades around $0.2491, slightly under the 20-day EMA at $0.2446. While the Hedera (HBAR) price outlook could recover with rising TVL, growing adoption, and ETF discussions, the market mood remains muted. For now, the Hedera (HBAR) price outlook stays uncertain as traders look for signs of either a deeper drop or a rebound. Cold Wallet Closes in on $6M While Use Cases Grow Fast Cold Wallet ($CWT) is emerging as one of the top trending crypto names of 2025, with progress driven by real results instead of hype. The price shifted from $0.007 to $0.00998 in Stage 17, while the launch price is fixed at $0.3517. This gives early buyers a chance for nearly 4,900% returns. Almost $6 million already raised shows this is a project with real momentum, not just another pitch. One factor that sets Cold Wallet apart is its launch method. Rather than building from zero, it secured Plus Wallet in a $270 million acquisition. That instantly brought in more than two million users. These users collect CWT simply by doing familiar tasks like swapping, paying gas fees, and moving between crypto and fiat. There is no extra training or new tools needed. The utility is already part of the system, and so is the demand. Another feature driving attention is its cashback rewards. Users receive up to 100% back on gas fees and 50% on swaps and bridges. This works without lockups or hidden terms. The referral program benefits both sides, with 10% in CWT going to the referrer and 5% to the new user. While many projects are still talking about future plans, Cold Wallet is already delivering. With $270 million in acquisitions, $5.9 million raised, and an active product in use, it is producing results now. And with its price still under one cent, CWT stands out as a top crypto to watch for strong returns in 2025. Why These Three Stand Out in a Shifting Market The Litecoin (LTC) price surge signals rising interest in how crypto treasuries are managed, while the Hedera (HBAR) price outlook still points to risks despite long-term potential. These changes show how quickly market stories can turn, yet Cold Wallet keeps moving forward. With a product already running, 2 million active users, and cashback rewards tied to daily crypto activity, it has reached a stage many others still aim for. Its sub-one-cent price, combined with a fixed $0.3517 launch and $5.9 million raised, makes Cold Wallet more than just another entry on the list of top trending presale crypto . It is among the few delivering real utility now, and that gives it lasting strength.

On August 12, US spot Ethereum ETFs achieved an astonishing milestone, attracting a combined net inflow of approximately $1.02 billion. This isn’t just a significant sum; it represents the largest single-day total ever recorded since the launch of these groundbreaking financial products, making it the first time daily Ethereum ETF inflows have surpassed the monumental $1 billion mark. This unprecedented surge signals a pivotal moment for the entire digital asset market , reflecting growing confidence and robust participation from major institutional players. What Drove These Record Ethereum ETF Inflows? The remarkable $1.02 billion influx on August 12, as reported by Trader T on X, wasn’t a broad, evenly distributed event. Instead, a few key players dominated the scene, showcasing where the bulk of the institutional crypto investment is currently flowing. Understanding these contributions helps paint a clearer picture of the market dynamics at play. BlackRock’s ETHA led the charge impressively, accounting for $640.68 million of the total. This highlights the substantial appetite from one of the world’s largest asset managers. Fidelity’s FETH followed with a strong performance, adding $276.90 million. Fidelity’s consistent presence in the crypto space continues to attract significant capital. Grayscale’s offerings also contributed, with its mini ETH seeing $66.57 million and its flagship ETHE adding $13.01 million. These figures indicate ongoing interest in established products. Other notable contributors included Van Eck’s ETHV ($9.42 million), Franklin’s EZET ($4.88 million), Bitwise’s ETHW ($4.30 million), and 21Shares’ CETH ($3.86 million). These diverse participants underscore the broad appeal of spot ETH ETFs across various investment firms. The fact that the remaining ETFs reported no change further emphasizes the concentrated nature of this record-breaking inflow, with a few major players driving the majority of the activity. Why Are US Spot Ethereum ETFs Gaining Traction? The significant inflows into US spot Ethereum ETFs are not merely isolated events; they are indicative of broader trends and advantages these products offer to investors. These ETFs provide a regulated and accessible gateway for traditional investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly owning the cryptocurrency. This ease of access is a powerful draw. For many institutional investors, the ability to trade Ethereum through a familiar brokerage account, under existing regulatory frameworks, simplifies compliance and operational complexities. This comfort level lowers the barrier to entry for large-scale capital. Furthermore, the transparency and liquidity offered by these ETFs make them an attractive option compared to direct crypto purchases, which can involve navigating complex exchanges and custody solutions. The approval and subsequent performance of these ETFs also lend an air of legitimacy to Ethereum as an asset class. This institutional validation can, in turn, attract even more capital, creating a positive feedback loop within the digital asset market . It signals that regulators and traditional finance are becoming increasingly comfortable with cryptocurrency-backed products. What Does This Mean for Institutional Crypto Investment? The recent surge in Ethereum ETF inflows underscores a growing confidence among major financial institutions in the long-term viability and potential of cryptocurrencies. This isn’t just retail enthusiasm; it’s a strategic move by sophisticated investors seeking diversification and growth opportunities. The substantial sums flowing into these products suggest that institutions are increasingly viewing Ethereum not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate component of a diversified portfolio. This trend has several implications for the future of institutional crypto investment : Mainstream Adoption: The success of these ETFs paves the way for broader acceptance of digital assets within traditional finance. It normalizes crypto exposure. Market Stability: Increased institutional participation can potentially bring more stability to the often-volatile crypto markets, as large investors tend to have longer-term horizons. Product Innovation: The success of spot Ethereum ETFs might encourage the development and approval of other cryptocurrency-backed financial products, further expanding investment avenues. Regulatory Clarity: The demand for these products puts pressure on regulators to provide clearer guidelines, which benefits the entire ecosystem. The record inflows into US spot Ethereum ETFs are a clear indicator that the bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world is strengthening, with significant capital now flowing across. Navigating the Future: Opportunities and Considerations While the recent record inflows are certainly exciting, it is important to consider both the opportunities and potential challenges ahead for spot ETH ETFs and the broader crypto landscape. The market remains dynamic, and investors should stay informed. Opportunities: Increased Liquidity: Higher trading volumes and larger asset bases can lead to deeper liquidity, making it easier for investors to enter and exit positions. Price Discovery: As more capital flows through regulated products, it can contribute to more efficient price discovery for Ethereum itself. Innovation: The success may spur further innovation in crypto-backed financial products, offering more tailored investment solutions. Considerations: Market Volatility: While institutional investment can bring stability, the underlying crypto market remains volatile. ETF values will still be subject to significant price swings. Regulatory Changes: The regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving. Future policy changes could impact ETF operations or investor sentiment. Competition: As more ETFs launch, competition for assets under management will intensify, potentially impacting fees and product offerings. The growth of US spot Ethereum ETFs is a testament to the evolving nature of finance, where digital assets are carving out a significant niche. These products offer a powerful avenue for diversified portfolios and could redefine investment strategies in the years to come. The monumental $1.02 billion inflow into US spot Ethereum ETFs on August 12 stands as a clear and compelling signal of accelerating institutional interest in the burgeoning digital asset market . This record-breaking day, largely propelled by giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, powerfully underscores the growing legitimacy and enhanced accessibility of Ethereum as a core investment asset. As these substantial Ethereum ETF inflows continue to redefine the investment landscape, they are set to bridge the gap even further between traditional finance and the innovative world of cryptocurrencies, truly marking a new and exciting era for institutional crypto investment .

This has come against a backdrop of good performance for these investment products so far in 2025. ETF Leaderboard According to an August 10 X post by wealth manager Nate Geraci, more than 1,300 ETFs have launched since the beginning of last year. He added that 10 of the top 20 by total inflows are crypto-related, including the top four overall. Among them are five spot Bitcoin ETFs, two spot Ethereum ETFs, a couple of MicroStrategy-focused option income ETFs, and one leveraged Ethereum ETF. Leading the pack is the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), which has amassed over $57.4 billion in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $12.1 billion. BlackRock’s Ethereum fund, ETHA, ranks third, pulling in $9.6 billion, while the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (MSTY) holds fourth place with $7.2 billion. Others in the top 20 include the ARK 21’s ARKB with $2.38 billion, Bitwise’s BITB with $2.32 billion, and the Fidelity Ethereum Fund ETF (FETH) with $2.23 billion. The Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF (BTC) has drawn $1.66 billion, while the 2x Ether ETF (ETHU) and the Defiance Daily Target 2x Long MicroStrategy ETF (MSTX) have brought in $1.64 billion and $1.52 billion, respectively. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas described the leaderboard as “wild,” noting that NEOS and YieldMax making it into the top 10 was also a “semi-shock.” ETFs Rebound Strongly Following Outflows Despite recent volatility, these investment products continue to post strong overall growth. Spot ETH ETFs saw a major reversal last week, experiencing $465 million in outflows on August 4. BlackRock’s ETHA recorded the largest negative movement, losing approximately $375 million. Fidelity’s FETH followed closely, with outflows of $55.1 million. However, SoSoValue data shows they have since rebounded, recording $461.21 million in net inflows on August 8 alone, bringing their cumulative total to $9.82 billion. ETHA was in the lead, attracting $254.73 million, followed by FETH with $132.35 million and Grayscale’s ETHE bringing in $26.84 million. On the other hand, spot BTC ETFs have faced heavier turbulence. After shedding $812 million on August 1, marking the second-largest single-day withdrawal in their history, outflows continued into early August, with BlackRock’s IBIT alone seeing a withdrawal of $292 million last Monday, while Fidelity’s FBTC and ARK Invest’s ARKB also experienced major losses. Despite the negative movement, they turned things around by the end of that week, posting $403.88 million in net inflows on August 8, to push their cumulative total to $54.43 billion. IBIT dominated the day with $359.98 million in inflows, while FBTC added $30.49 million.

This breakdown reveals the substantial impact on traders, particularly those holding long positions. Understanding these liquidations is crucial for anyone navigating the often-turbulent digital asset landscape. What Are Perpetual Futures and Crypto Liquidations? Before diving into the numbers, let’s clarify what we mean. Perpetual futures contracts are a popular type of derivative in the crypto space. They allow traders to speculate on the future price of an asset, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, without an expiry date. This flexibility makes them highly attractive, but they also come with inherent risks, especially when leverage is involved. A crypto liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange. This happens because the trader’s margin (collateral) falls below the required maintenance level. Essentially, if the market moves sharply against a leveraged position, the exchange liquidates it to prevent further losses, protecting both the trader and the exchange. The 24-Hour Shockwave: Unpacking Long Liquidations The past 24 hours saw substantial positions wiped out, predominantly from long traders. Here’s the specific breakdown: Ethereum (ETH): $135.11 million liquidated, with 63.55% being long positions. This indicates a significant downward movement catching bullish ETH traders off guard. Bitcoin (BTC): $85.05 million liquidated, with a striking 76.53% from long positions. Bitcoin, as the market leader, often sets the tone, and its long liquidations signal broader market sentiment. Solana (SOL): $23.02 million liquidated, with an overwhelming 92.75% from long positions. This percentage highlights a particularly aggressive move against SOL long holders. This recent wave of long liquidations indicates a sudden downturn or increased selling pressure. It caught many bullish traders unprepared, leading to forced closures of their positions. Why Does Such Market Volatility Occur? High levels of market volatility are a hallmark of the cryptocurrency space. Several factors can contribute to these sharp price movements that trigger liquidations. These include: Macroeconomic News: Global economic data or central bank decisions can influence investor sentiment across all markets, including crypto. Regulatory Developments: New regulations or enforcement actions can create uncertainty and impact prices. Whale Movements: Large transactions by significant holders (whales) can cause immediate price swings. Technical Factors: Breaking key support or resistance levels can trigger automated selling or buying, exacerbating price trends. Such significant liquidations often trigger cascading effects. Forced selling can further depress prices, leading to more liquidations in a chain reaction. Navigating the Risks of Perpetual Futures Trading For traders engaging with perpetual futures , understanding and managing risk is paramount. The data from the last 24 hours serves as a stark reminder of the potential downsides. Here are some actionable insights: Use Prudent Leverage: While leverage can amplify gains, it also magnifies losses. Use it cautiously and understand its implications. Set Stop-Loss Orders: Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses on your positions. This is a critical tool to prevent full liquidation. Monitor Market Sentiment: Stay informed about market news, technical indicators, and overall sentiment to anticipate potential shifts. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid putting all your capital into a single highly leveraged position. The cryptocurrency market remains incredibly dynamic. While opportunities abound, so do risks. The recent crypto perpetual futures liquidation events underscore the importance of disciplined trading strategies and robust risk management. Staying informed and prepared is your best defense against unexpected market movements. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is crypto perpetual futures liquidation? Crypto perpetual futures liquidation is the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange. This happens when the market moves against their trade, and their margin collateral falls below the required level, preventing further losses. Why do liquidations happen in perpetual futures trading? Liquidations primarily occur due to high leverage combined with significant price movements against a trader’s position. When a trader’s margin cannot cover potential losses, the exchange automatically closes the position. What does ‘long liquidation’ mean? A ‘long liquidation’ specifically refers to the forced closure of a ‘long’ position. A long position is a bet that an asset’s price will increase. If the price drops significantly, long positions are liquidated. How can traders avoid liquidation in perpetual futures? Traders can avoid liquidation by using lower leverage, setting strict stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts, and closely monitoring market conditions to react quickly to adverse price movements. What impact do large crypto liquidations have on the market? Large liquidations can intensify market volatility and accelerate price trends. As positions are forcibly closed, it adds selling pressure (for long liquidations) or buying pressure (for short liquidations), potentially leading to a cascade effect and further price swings.

This latest announcement on X confirms the acquisition of an additional 518 Bitcoin (BTC), pushing their total holdings to an impressive 18,113 BTC. This bold step further solidifies Metaplanet’s position as a leading proponent of Metaplanet Bitcoin integration into corporate balance sheets, signaling a growing trend in institutional digital asset adoption. What Drives Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Investment Strategy? Metaplanet’s consistent and aggressive approach to accumulating Bitcoin isn’t just a fleeting trend; it’s a deliberate Bitcoin investment strategy . The company has clearly articulated its belief in Bitcoin as a long-term store of value and a hedge against currency devaluation. In an economic landscape marked by inflation concerns and volatile fiat currencies, corporations are increasingly seeking alternative assets to protect and grow their capital. Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it attractive as a hedge against inflation, preserving purchasing power over time. Long-Term Value: Many institutions view Bitcoin as “digital gold,” anticipating its value to appreciate significantly in the coming decades due to its scarcity and growing adoption. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding Bitcoin helps diversify corporate treasuries, reducing reliance on traditional assets that may be susceptible to economic downturns. This strategy mirrors that of pioneers like MicroStrategy, showcasing a growing confidence among public companies in Bitcoin’s future. The Impact of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption on the Market The continued surge in corporate Bitcoin adoption by companies like Metaplanet sends a powerful message to the global financial markets. When publicly traded entities commit substantial capital to Bitcoin, it lends immense legitimacy to the asset class. This institutional embrace can have several positive ripple effects: Increased Market Legitimacy: Corporate holdings normalize Bitcoin as a viable investment, encouraging more mainstream investors to consider it. Supply Shock Potential: As more companies hold Bitcoin for the long term, the circulating supply available on exchanges could decrease, potentially leading to price appreciation due to scarcity. Enhanced Investor Confidence: Seeing well-established companies allocate significant resources to Bitcoin can boost confidence among retail and institutional investors alike. Metaplanet’s actions contribute directly to this evolving narrative, demonstrating that Bitcoin is not just for individual investors but a serious asset for corporate treasuries. Metaplanet’s Growing BTC Holdings: A Deep Dive With its latest acquisition, Metaplanet’s total BTC holdings now stand at an impressive 18,113 Bitcoin. To put this into perspective, this positions the company among the top publicly traded entities globally with substantial Bitcoin reserves. Their consistent accumulation over recent months highlights a sustained commitment rather than a one-off investment. This steady accumulation strategy means: Metaplanet is effectively removing a significant amount of Bitcoin from the open market. Their balance sheet is increasingly tied to the performance of Bitcoin, indicating strong conviction. The company is signaling to other potential corporate investors that such a strategy is not only feasible but desirable. Their transparency in announcing these acquisitions further builds trust within the crypto community and provides valuable insights into institutional investment trends. Navigating Challenges and Opportunities for a Japanese Crypto Company Operating as a prominent Japanese crypto company like Metaplanet comes with unique dynamics. Japan has a well-established, albeit strict, regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, aiming to protect investors while fostering innovation. This environment means companies must navigate compliance carefully. Potential Challenges: Regulatory Scrutiny: Strict rules require diligent adherence and can limit certain operational flexibilities. Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price fluctuations can impact balance sheet valuations, requiring robust risk management. Public Perception: While growing, public acceptance of crypto as a mainstream asset can still be a hurdle in some traditional sectors. Significant Opportunities: Regulatory Clarity: A clear framework, even if strict, provides certainty for businesses to operate and innovate. Leading the Asian Market: Metaplanet can set a precedent for other Asian companies considering Bitcoin adoption. Innovation Hub: Japan’s tech-forward culture can foster further crypto innovation, benefiting early movers. Metaplanet’s success in this landscape could inspire more Japanese firms to explore similar strategies, further cementing the nation’s role in the global crypto economy. In conclusion, Metaplanet’s latest acquisition of 518 BTC is more than just a transaction; it’s a powerful statement. It underscores the company’s unwavering commitment to its Metaplanet Bitcoin strategy and highlights the accelerating trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption worldwide. As more companies follow suit, the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, solidifying Bitcoin’s role as a cornerstone asset for the future of finance. This ongoing accumulation by publicly traded entities reinforces the long-term bullish outlook for Bitcoin, signaling a paradigm shift in how corporations manage their treasuries. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How much Bitcoin does Metaplanet now hold in total? Following its latest acquisition, Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin holdings have reached an impressive 18,113 BTC. Why is Metaplanet investing so heavily in Bitcoin? Metaplanet’s significant Bitcoin investments are part of a strategic decision to hedge against inflation, diversify its balance sheet, and capitalize on Bitcoin’s potential as a long-term store of value, viewing it as “digital gold.” How does corporate Bitcoin adoption impact the broader crypto market? Corporate Bitcoin adoption, exemplified by companies like Metaplanet, enhances Bitcoin’s legitimacy, boosts investor confidence, and can potentially lead to a supply squeeze as more BTC is held off the market, contributing to price appreciation. Is Metaplanet the only Japanese company making substantial Bitcoin investments? While Metaplanet is a prominent example, the trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption is growing globally. Metaplanet’s actions may inspire other Japanese firms to consider similar strategies, though they are currently a leader in this specific approach within Japan. What are the potential risks associated with Metaplanet’s Bitcoin strategy? Key risks include Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility, which can impact the company’s balance sheet valuation, and the need to navigate Japan’s strict regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. Public perception can also pose a challenge. If you found this insight into Metaplanet’s strategic Bitcoin acquisition valuable, please share this article with your network on social media!

It’s approaching a critical $0.002 level that traders have been eyeing for weeks. While Bitcoin (BTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE) stay relatively steady, there’s a growing sense that NOT might be gearing up for a breakout of its own.

Notcoin’s recent volume spikes suggest that some insiders and savvy traders are quietly loading up in anticipation. This kind of stealth accumulation often precedes bigger moves in emerging projects. What Could This Mean for Investors? If Notcoin breaks above the $0.002 mark convincingly, it could trigger a wave of momentum. That said, altcoins can be unpredictable, and smart investors always keep an eye on broader market trends alongside individual project developments. Bitcoin and Dogecoin holding firm adds a layer of confidence, but many analysts believe the real upside is in finding those smaller projects where institutional or smart money is quietly building positions. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Altcoin Forecasted for 86x ROI While Notcoin builds up steam, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains a top pick for those looking for explosive returns this cycle. Analysts project an 86x ROI for early backers — a figure that’s turning heads in the altcoin community.

After periods of heightened uncertainty, recent developments, particularly the US-China trade truce, have injected a fresh wave of confidence, leading to notable movements in currency valuations. This shift is not just a fleeting moment but a significant indicator for investors keen on understanding where the next opportunities lie, especially concerning Asian Currencies and the steadfast nature of US Dollar Stability . As central banks worldwide continue to navigate complex economic landscapes, the impending decision on RBA Interest Rates adds another layer of anticipation, making this a pivotal moment for market watchers. Asian Currencies on the Rise: What’s Driving the Momentum? The recent uptick in Asian Currencies marks a significant turnaround, reflecting a broader sentiment of risk-on appetite among investors. For months, trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies had cast a long shadow, prompting capital flight from emerging markets and pushing investors towards safer assets. However, the announcement of a provisional US China Trade Deal has begun to reverse this trend. Currencies like the Chinese Yuan (CNY), Korean Won (KRW), and Singapore Dollar (SGD) have shown resilience, creeping higher as the immediate threat of escalating tariffs recedes. This resurgence is underpinned by several factors: Improved Trade Outlook: A trade truce implies less disruption to supply chains and improved export prospects for Asian economies, many of which are heavily reliant on trade. Investor Confidence: Reduced uncertainty encourages foreign direct investment and portfolio inflows back into the region, bolstering local currencies. Economic Fundamentals: While global growth remains a concern, the relative strength and resilience of some Asian economies provide a stable base for their currencies. This positive momentum for Asian Currencies suggests that the region is poised to benefit from a more stable global trade environment, potentially attracting further investment as market participants seek growth opportunities beyond traditional safe havens. The US China Trade Deal: A Foundation for Stability? The interim US China Trade Deal , though not a comprehensive resolution, has played a crucial role in calming market nerves. The agreement, which reportedly includes a rollback of some tariffs and commitments from China to purchase more U.S. agricultural products, has been widely interpreted as a de-escalation of a conflict that threatened global economic growth. For the Global Forex Market , this means a reduction in systemic risk. Previously, every tweet or statement regarding trade negotiations had the potential to trigger volatile swings. Now, with a tentative truce in place, a degree of predictability has returned. The implications of this deal extend beyond just the immediate trade flows: Reduced Uncertainty: Businesses can plan with more clarity, potentially leading to increased investment and hiring. Supply Chain Relief: Companies that had been restructuring supply chains due to tariff threats can now reassess, potentially leading to cost efficiencies. Boost to Global Sentiment: The agreement fosters a more positive outlook for global economic cooperation, which benefits all trade-dependent nations. While the finer details and long-term implications are still unfolding, the initial impact has been overwhelmingly positive, providing a much-needed breath of fresh air for economies and currencies sensitive to trade relations. US Dollar Stability: A Safe Haven’s Shifting Role Amidst the fluctuating fortunes of other currencies, the US Dollar Stability has been a notable constant. Despite the trade truce and the resulting risk-on sentiment, the greenback has largely held its ground, neither weakening significantly nor strengthening dramatically. This stability can be attributed to several factors that underscore the dollar’s enduring appeal as a global reserve currency and safe haven asset. The dollar’s performance is often a reflection of global risk appetite. When uncertainty reigns, investors flock to the dollar, driving its value up. Conversely, a reduction in risk might lead to a sell-off as funds move into higher-yielding assets. However, the current scenario presents a nuanced picture: Yield Advantage: Even with other central banks contemplating rate cuts, the U.S. still offers relatively attractive yields compared to many developed markets. Economic Resilience: The U.S. economy continues to show signs of robustness, supporting the dollar’s underlying strength. Liquidity: The sheer depth and liquidity of U.S. financial markets make the dollar an indispensable currency for global transactions and investments. This consistent US Dollar Stability provides a crucial anchor in the Global Forex Market . While it may not offer the explosive gains seen in some riskier assets, its reliability remains a cornerstone for international trade and finance, making it a key component of any diversified portfolio. RBA Interest Rates: The Next Big Market Mover? Beyond the geopolitical landscape, central bank actions remain a primary driver for currency movements. All eyes are now turning to the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) as it contemplates its next move on RBA Interest Rates . Australia, as a commodity-rich economy with strong ties to China, is particularly sensitive to global trade dynamics and domestic economic indicators. Market participants are closely scrutinizing economic data, including inflation, employment, and retail sales, to gauge the likelihood of a rate cut or hold. The RBA’s decision carries significant weight, not just for the Australian Dollar (AUD) but also for regional currencies and broader sentiment in the Global Forex Market . Potential scenarios and their implications include: RBA Decision Potential Impact on AUD Broader Market Implications Rate Cut Likely AUD weakness as lower rates reduce its attractiveness to foreign investors. Signals RBA’s concern about economic growth; could prompt other central banks to consider easing. Hold Rates Potential AUD strength, especially if market had priced in a cut. Reflects RBA confidence. Suggests RBA believes current policy is sufficient; could lead to more stable regional sentiment. The RBA’s approach to RBA Interest Rates will offer crucial insights into the health of the Australian economy and, by extension, provide a barometer for the wider Asia-Pacific region, influencing investor decisions regarding Asian Currencies . Beyond the Headlines: Challenges and Opportunities in the Global Forex Market While the recent trade truce has brought relief, the Global Forex Market still faces a myriad of challenges. The path to sustained global economic growth remains uneven, with lingering uncertainties that could quickly shift market sentiment. Investors must remain vigilant and consider the broader context: Lingering Trade Tensions: The current US China Trade Deal is a ‘phase one’ agreement. Future negotiations could still face hurdles, reigniting trade anxieties. Geopolitical Risks: Unforeseen geopolitical events in various parts of the world can quickly trigger risk aversion and impact currency flows. Global Growth Concerns: Despite positive signs, underlying weaknesses in global manufacturing and services could still weigh on economic forecasts. Monetary Policy Divergence: Different central banks adopting varied approaches to interest rates and quantitative easing can create volatility and opportunities. However, these challenges also present opportunities for savvy investors. Understanding these dynamics is key to navigating the forex landscape successfully. The interplay between trade agreements, central bank policies like those on RBA Interest Rates , and the inherent stability of major currencies like the US Dollar creates a complex but fascinating environment for those looking to capitalize on market movements. Navigating the Currents: Actionable Insights for Investors For those looking to engage with the Global Forex Market , particularly with an eye on Asian Currencies and the broader economic shifts, here are some actionable insights: Monitor Trade Developments Closely: While the truce is positive, stay updated on the progress of future US-China negotiations. Any breakdown could reverse the current positive trend for Asian Currencies . Track Central Bank Communications: Beyond the RBA, pay attention to statements from the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, and Bank of Japan. Their policy stances directly influence the US Dollar Stability and other major currency pairs. Diversify Your Portfolio: Consider a balanced approach that includes both growth-oriented Asian Currencies and more stable assets like the US Dollar, depending on your risk tolerance. Understand Economic Indicators: Keep an eye on key economic data releases (inflation, GDP, employment) from major economies. These provide fundamental insights into currency strength. Manage Risk Prudently: Volatility is inherent in forex. Utilize stop-loss orders and appropriate position sizing to protect your capital. By adopting a well-informed and strategic approach, investors can better position themselves to capitalize on the evolving dynamics of the currency markets. Conclusion: A Cautious Optimism for Asian Currencies The current landscape of the Global Forex Market presents a fascinating interplay of geopolitical diplomacy and economic fundamentals. The tentative US China Trade Deal has undeniably injected a much-needed dose of optimism, particularly benefiting Asian Currencies which are now showing signs of renewed vigor. This shift, coupled with the ongoing demonstration of US Dollar Stability , paints a picture of a market finding its footing after a period of significant turbulence. As the world awaits the RBA’s decision on RBA Interest Rates , it underscores the continued importance of central bank policies in shaping market directions. While challenges persist, the current environment offers a compelling narrative of cautious recovery and emerging opportunities for investors willing to navigate its complexities. The coming months will be crucial in determining if this fragile truce can evolve into a sustained period of global economic harmony, further cementing the gains seen in Asian markets.

The explosive growth coincides with the protocol’s Total Value Locked (TVL) surpassing $10 billion for the first time, driven by surging adoption of its synthetic dollar, USDe, which recently became the world’s third-largest stablecoin by market cap. Daily $5 million ENA buybacks are tightening supply, while whale addresses holding 100k–1M ENA have grown 12% in July, now controlling nearly 30% of circulating tokens. Ethena (ENA)’s Golden Cross Signals Strong Bullish Momentum Technically, ENA’s breakout has been supported by a golden cross, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average crossing above the 200-day EMA, a classic bullish indicator. The token’s RSI is near 74, suggesting strong momentum without extreme overbought conditions, while the MACD has confirmed a bullish crossover. On August 10, ENA surged 14.7% from $0.64 to $0.81, breaking a bullish flag pattern and pushing toward today’s high near $0.85. Immediate resistance sits at $0.8741 and the psychological $1.00 level. A decisive break above $1 could trigger a run toward $1.25 and potentially $1.50, according to analysts. However, $29.8M in ENA moved to exchanges between August 9–10, which could spark short-term volatility. Key downside supports lie at $0.70, $0.56, and $0.47. Ecosystem Growth and Whale Activity Boost Outlook The USDe stablecoin is now supported across 23 blockchains via LayerZero, processing over $743M in cross-chain volume last week alone. Ethena’s expanding ecosystem, combined with strong derivatives market activity, futures volume surged 41.84% to $4.35B, points to sustained market interest. Whale accumulation has been particularly notable, with large holders increasing their stakes by over 30% in the past week. Analysts say these moves, along with the pending activation of Ethena’s “ fee switch ” to reward ENA holders, could significantly enhance token value. Provided that bullish momentum continues, Ethena’s robust technical performance, notable on-chain expansion, and increasing institutional engagement collectively position it as one of the top DeFi tokens.

At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading above $120,000, only a short distance from the record of more than $123,000. Over the last seven days, the asset has posted a gain of approximately 5.1%, placing it among the stronger performers in the digital asset market. Amid the price movement, on-chain data from the TRON network’s USDT transfers is offering insights into current market behavior. CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha analyzed TRC-20 USDT transaction flows and identified patterns that may serve as potential indicators of Bitcoin price shifts. By categorizing transactions into six size groups, ranging from retail trades of $100 to large “super whale” transfers exceeding $10 million, the analysis aims to distinguish between everyday market activity and institutional-scale transactions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run At Risk? Binance Whale-To-Exchange Flow Signals Price Correction Large USDT Transfers as a Market Signal Taha’s research notes that when transactions exceeding $10 million in USDT on the TRON network surpass $5 billion in a single day, this often coincides with significant profit-taking in Bitcoin. Such activity typically involves converting BTC into USDT, followed by transferring the stablecoins to private wallets, reducing buying pressure in the spot market. Past examples include July 16, when $10M+ USDT transfers reached $5.2 billion, followed by a 4.5% decline in BTC, and July 23, when $5.8 billion in similar transfers preceded a 3.8% drop within 48 hours. Current data, however, shows a lack of such large-scale transactions, suggesting that major holders are not actively selling into stablecoins at present. This absence of substantial whale outflows may indicate that large investors are maintaining positions rather than exiting the market. Bitcoin Shifting Market Participation and Potential Breakout Scenarios A separate analysis from CryptoQuant’s ShayanMarkets examined the average executed order size in Bitcoin futures markets, providing another perspective on participation trends. This metric, which divides total traded volume by the number of executed orders, helps identify whether activity is being driven by retail participants or larger, institutional traders. Data from late 2024 and early 2025 showed periods of whale dominance, which coincided with strong rallies. In contrast, recent weeks have seen a rise in smaller, retail-sized orders, while whale-driven trades have diminished. This shift suggests that large-scale buyers may be holding positions acquired at lower price levels or waiting for new market conditions before re-entering with significant volume.

The current absence of such behavior leaves open the possibility of a bullish breakout above Bitcoin’s previous all-time high, provided that renewed selling pressure from large investors does not emerge in the near term.

Pro-Crypto Regulations Fuel Market Optimism Ethereum notably broke through the $4,000 barrier for the first time in almost nine months, closing the gap to its all-time high of $4,878, now just 13% away. This upward momentum has been attributed to growing interest in cryptocurrencies, bolstered by pro-crypto regulatory measures that have enhanced market sentiment.

Notably, the US has spearheaded a new wave of pro-crypto regulations, sparking a surge in investment in the digital asset market with the passage and signing of the first crypto bill, the GENIUS Act. This new legislation aims to create a more favorable regulatory framework for stablecoins, which are dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. Ethereum plays a key role in the stablecoin market, as a large portion of stablecoin activity occurs on its blockchain. In contrast, Bitcoin approached its current record high of $123,000 earlier in the day but ultimately fell short of the critical $120,000 mark, which is seen as essential for entering a new price discovery phase. Despite this, the overall market sentiment remains buoyant, particularly in light of recent executive orders from President Donald Trump aimed at fostering a more favorable environment for digital assets. Ethereum Could Hit $8,000 On Thursday, Trump issued directives calling for a reevaluation of federal guidance on integrating cryptocurrencies into employer-sponsored retirement plans like 401(k)s. Analysts view this shift as a potential boom for the crypto industry, especially considering that 401(k) assets totaled $8.7 trillion in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Investment Company Institute. As such, Ethereum has outperformed many of its peers among the top ten cryptocurrencies, posting gains of just over 13% in the past week. The only token to surpass this growth has been Cronos (CRO), which saw an 18% rally during the same period. Related Reading: AI Models Predict Ethereum Cycle Top At $15,000: Analyst Crypto analyst Doctor Profit has weighed in on Ethereum’s performance, suggesting that breaking the $4,000 barrier signals a massive breakout from an ascending triangle pattern on the monthly chart. This pattern is considered bullish, indicating that Ethereum could continue its upward trajectory in the coming months. In a recent analysis shared on X (formerly Twitter), Doctor Profit projected that Ethereum might reach new heights, potentially hitting $8,000. If this forecast holds true, it would represent an impressive 88% increase from ETH’s current trading price of $4,250 as of late Monday.

While some well-known names have already made big moves, others are just starting to gain traction. The best crypto to buy right now is coming from a mix of established networks, new utility-driven chains, and community-powered plays. From clearer regulations to new integrations and meme-fueled hype, each project in this lineup is making waves for specific reasons. Whether the focus is utility, market momentum, or strong technical patterns, these four picks: BlockDAG, XRP, Sui, and PENGU, are well worth following. With prices holding above key support zones and sentiment turning positive, these choices could ride the next upward leg. For those preparing a crypto watchlist, this set brings together both stability and breakout potential, making it a strong contender for the best crypto to buy list before mainstream attention takes over. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Massive ROI Window in Batch 29 BlockDAG is securing its place as one of the most successful presales in recent memory. Now priced at $0.0276 in Batch 29, it aims for a confirmed listing at $0.05, locking in a 2,660% gain for those who joined from Batch 1. That gap shows why it’s considered among the best cryptos to buy before the presale ends. The scale of its presale is hard to ignore: over $370 million raised, more than 25 billion coins sold, and miner sales topping $7.7 million with 19,179 units sold. This growth is backed by an expanding user base using the X1 mobile mining app, now with over 2.5 million downloads. BlockDAG isn’t relying on hype alone. The project also has a live Demo Trading Dashboard for simulated market practice for the community. Its Layer 1 network is designed for high performance, giving it a long-term use case beyond the presale. With the final batches approaching and demand staying high, BlockDAG is not just filling presale stages; it’s building an active ecosystem. If momentum continues, it could be one of the most impactful entries on any best crypto to buy shortlist this year. 2. XRP (Ripple): Clear Legal Outcome Fuels Momentum XRP has moved past years of legal uncertainty after the SEC dropped its appeal and agreed to a $125 million penalty. The market responded with an 11% jump, showing how regulatory clarity can boost confidence. This resolution removes a major obstacle and keeps XRP high on the best crypto to buy watchlist for those tracking projects with established real-world use. Technically, XRP is consolidating near $3.30 with resistance at $3.34. A breakout above could trigger higher targets in a market that values assets with legal stability and cross-border utility. Broader market forces, such as expected interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, could add to the momentum. The alignment of strong fundamentals with positive macro conditions gives XRP room to push higher if key resistance breaks. 3. Sui (SUI): Banking Integration Lifts Price Outlook Sui has gained momentum through both technical and partnership wins. Its integration with Swiss bank Sygnum, covering custody, staking, and trading, sparked an 8.6% price rise and brought its market cap above $13 billion. On the charts, SUI has broken out of a falling-wedge pattern and is targeting levels around $4.58. This aligns with the broader trend of capital rotating into scalable Layer 1 projects. For those exploring the best crypto to buy in emerging networks, Sui offers both a developing ecosystem and favorable technical positioning. Institutional backing combined with strong price action gives Sui a blend of credibility and momentum that could carry through the next rally. 4. PENGU (Pudgy Penguins): Meme Strength with Staying Power PENGU, linked to the Pudgy Penguins NFT brand, is showing that meme coins can sustain more than short-term attention. Trading at $0.0374, it has logged over $660 million in daily volume and a 150% rise over the past month. Its steady 12% weekly gains reflect ongoing market interest. While it doesn’t have the infrastructure of a Layer 1, its active community, cultural relevance, and growing liquidity keep it on the radar as one of the best cryptos to buy for sentiment-driven plays with market depth. Final Takeaway The market is rewarding projects that pair momentum with substance. BlockDAG is pushing toward its listing with a presale structure designed for outsized gains. XRP benefits from legal clarity and a strong technical base. Sui combines banking partnerships with technical breakouts. PENGU channels meme culture into measurable market activity. Together, these picks show that the next rally may favor a mix of utility, adoption, and cultural influence. For those preparing for the next phase of the cycle, these names earn their spot among the best crypto to buy before the wider market catches on.

Smart investors are turning away from short-lived trends and zeroing in on projects that build consistently, deliver on promises, and show real-world traction. The winners aren’t just chasing attention, they’re proving they can keep it. The real hunt for the top altcoins to watch in 2025 is about finding those with substance: strong user numbers, active products, and growing adoption. Cold Wallet ($CWT), Cardano, Shiba Inu, and Sei are ticking those boxes, moving fast but with purpose. Here’s why these four are starting to look unstoppable. 1. Cold Wallet: CoinMarketCap Listed & Still Under $0.01 Cold Wallet (CWT) is making waves in stage 17 of its presale at just $0.00998. With a confirmed launch price of $0.3517, early buyers are staring at huge upside. Its recent CoinMarketCap listing has driven a surge of visibility, pulling in fresh interest and boosting engagement on Telegram and X. Unlike many presale tokens, Cold Wallet is already live. Its cashback system pays users in CWT every time they swap, transfer, or use ramps, rewards that hit instantly, not “someday.” Adoption is climbing fast. The $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet instantly brought 2 million users into the fold, giving CWT both credibility and a massive built-in audience. With $5.9 million raised and Stage 18 just around the corner, this 150-stage presale is still in its early chapters. Working utility, growing exposure, and a launch price still far ahead make it one of the top altcoins to watch in 2025. Momentum here isn’t theoretical, it’s unfolding in real time. 2. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Breaks Long-Term Trend Shiba Inu has shattered its long-term descending wedge, hinting at a major upside run. Trading at $0.00001329, analysts are eyeing $0.000044 by October. Fibonacci levels are holding, with key support at $0.000012314. Aggressive token burns are cutting supply while SHIB’s Metaverse and DeFi expansion keep adding utility. If momentum continues, upside targets range from $0.000033 to $0.0000943. This breakout, backed by community-driven growth, keeps SHIB firmly in the top altcoins to watch in 2025, especially if it challenges old highs before 2026. 3. Cardano (ADA) Keeps Breaking Higher on Strong Metrics Cardano (ADA) is delivering a performance worth tracking. Up 60% in the last month and trading near $0.87, it recently hit $0.92, its best in four months. Open interest is at a record $1.66 billion, signaling heavy market conviction. DeFi TVL just crossed $412 million, the highest since early 2024. With weekly RSI at 58 and volumes climbing from $8.12 billion to $10.3 billion, ADA’s push toward $1 seems imminent, with $1.60 possible before year-end. For traders mapping the top altcoins to watch in 2025, Cardano’s mix of breakout momentum and strengthening fundamentals is a clear buy signal. 4. Sei (SEI) Shows Breakout Potential with Massive TVL Growth Sei is trading at $0.3273, building a bullish cup-and-handle pattern. TVL has surged from $20 million to $600 million, highlighting explosive adoption. Analysts are focused on the $0.33–$0.35 zone for a confirmed breakout. Indicators like MACD and CMF remain bullish, and if buying volume ramps up, SEI could climb to $0.50 quickly, with $1.00 on the table if it mirrors early 2024 momentum. Among the top altcoins to watch in 2025, Sei’s rapid ecosystem expansion, stablecoin integrations, and reliable chart structure make it a stealth contender. Projects Moving with Real Purpose Some tokens rise quietly, no hype, just results. Cold Wallet is already there, live with $5.9 million raised and 2 million users onboarded from a major acquisition. Cardano is sustaining its breakout with $1.66 billion in open interest and growing DeFi strength. Shiba Inu’s wedge breakout, supply cuts, and ecosystem growth signal a revival in progress. Sei’s $600 million TVL leap confirms rising trust and adoption. For those watching closely, these four are the top altcoins to watch in 2025, but Cold Wallet’s live utility and narrowing crypto presale entry give it a unique edge over the rest.

XRP and USDT are feeling the pressure, traders are adjusting their strategies, and questions are flying about which assets could benefit. With Beijing halting stablecoin promotions and research, the shift could open doors for coins that tick the right boxes for regulators. Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being tipped as the best crypto presale to buy this year. For traders looking ahead to 2025, this one’s gaining attention for all the right reasons. Beijing’s Stablecoin Clampdown Sends Ripples Through the Market Chinese regulators recently told brokerages, think tanks, and research groups to freeze all activity around stablecoins. This included halting seminars, cancelling educational events, and removing any public endorsements of stablecoin trading. The order came after weeks of behind-the-scenes discussions in late July and early August. Officials cited risks around retail speculation, fraud, and broader financial stability. While the ban doesn’t make holding or trading stablecoins illegal, it effectively removes public support and visibility for them inside China. For traders watching USDT news, this is a major shift. USDT remains one of the most widely used stablecoins for global trading pairs, but losing visibility in such a large market could impact liquidity over time. XRP, while not a stablecoin, is also feeling the effects. Ripple’s token has long been under the microscope of regulators worldwide, and sentiment often swings on policy headlines. Right now, the XRP price prediction is getting mixed views — some see the crackdown as an indirect negative for cross-border payment tokens, while others believe XRP could adapt faster than most due to its compliance-focused partnerships. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Rated Best Crypto Presale for Strategic Buyers With stablecoins losing ground in one of the world’s largest markets, some traders are pivoting to regulation-friendly altcoins. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE comes in. Industry watchers have ranked it as the best crypto presale to buy for strategic buyers aiming to position ahead of 2025. The project is making waves for its compliance-aware approach, community-driven growth model, and early-stage access that allows entry before potential major exchange listings. Investors looking for the best crypto to buy 2025 are taking note of how MAGACOIN positions itself — not just chasing hype, but aligning with regulatory trends that could define the next bull cycle. For those seeking regulation-friendly altcoins, the presale stage offers a way to get in before wider adoption. Could Regulation-Friendly Coins Outperform in 2025? The crackdown in China is a reminder that regulations can shift the market overnight. Assets that can operate under tighter rules without losing their core value proposition could gain an edge. This is why MAGACOIN is starting to appear on lists alongside more established tokens — not as a competitor to USDT or XRP, but as a different category altogether. While traders debate the next XRP price prediction or monitor USDT news, others are positioning in presales they believe could be safer bets in a changing global market. If the trends continue, coins that blend growth potential with a clean regulatory profile could lead the pack into 2025. MAGACOIN’s strategy seems aimed right at that sweet spot, making it one of the more interesting plays for buyers who think ahead.

The price is consolidating and might dip below the $3.080 support zone in the near term. XRP price is struggling to settle above the $3.250 zone. The price is now trading below $3.250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a key contracting triangle with support at $3.20 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it stays above the $3.080 zone. XRP Price Approaches Key Support XRP price formed a base above the $2.920 level and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price gained pace for a move above the $3.20 and $3.25 resistance levels. The bulls pumped the price above the $3.320 level before the bears appeared. A high was formed at $3.380 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the $3.250 level. The price dipped below 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.90 swing low to the $3.380 high. Besides, there was a break below a key contracting triangle with support at $3.20 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $3.220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $3.20 level. The first major resistance is near the $3.220 level. A clear move above the $3.220 resistance might send the price toward the $3.2650 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.320 resistance or even $3.350 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near the $3.450 zone. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $3.220 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3.120 level. The next major support is near the $3.080 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.90 swing low to the $3.380 high. If there is a downside break and a close below the $3.080 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $3.020 support. The next major support sits near the $3.00 zone where the bulls might take a stand. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $3.120 and $3.080.

BlockDAG (BDAG) has now raised $370 million, selling over 25 billion coins, with Batch 29 priced at $0.0276 ahead of its confirmed $0.05 launch value. Early Batch 1 participants are looking at a projected return of around 2,660%. Meanwhile, Avalanche (AVAX) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are showing technical setups that could lead to near-term breakouts. For traders, the scenarios differ: BlockDAG offers a structured entry point through its current pricing stage, while AVAX and SHIB’s moves rely on chart-driven momentum. The contrast is sharpening market attention on what could be the top crypto to buy in 2025. Avalanche (AVAX) Price Prediction Gains Pace Avalanche’s fundamentals are strong, supported by a 90% rise in total value locked (TVL) since March, now at $1.9 billion. This growth solidifies its position as a capable Layer 1 network. Technically, AVAX recently reached the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, consolidating before a potential move toward the 1.618 extension at $34.20. Support at $17.20 is reinforced by upward momentum in RSI and KDJ, hinting at a possible trend reversal. The main challenge lies in breaking the $36–$43 resistance zone, which aligns with historical price caps and the 0.618 Fib. If cleared, a path toward $72–$89 could open. Long term, maintaining $20–$23 support strengthens the case for an Avalanche (AVAX) Price Prediction above $80, aided by $250 million in real-world asset inflows. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Analysis Maintains Bullish Structure Shiba Inu fell 9% this week to $0.000012 but remains 7% higher for the month. Strong support at $0.00001200 has held, leading to a rebound that puts resistance at $0.00001250 in sight. On-chain data shows SHIB’s exchange reserves near yearly lows, suggesting minimal selling pressure. The Chaikin Money Flow is showing bullish divergence, pointing to quiet accumulation despite price pullbacks. Technically, SHIB is trading inside an ascending triangle with resistance levels at $0.00001258, $0.00001318, and $0.00001368. $370M Raised! Record-Breaking Presale Pushes BlockDAG Into Headlines BlockDAG’s presale total has reached $370 million, with over 25 billion coins sold. Batch 29 is currently available at $0.0276, offering entry. Early buyers can secure positions at a substantial discount to the expected market debut value. The updated Dashboard V4 has set a new benchmark for presale transparency by simulating live exchange conditions. Users can view charts, place instant buy/sell orders, check the order book, and track referrals in real time. Leaderboards and bonus calculators keep engagement high. The X1 and X10 Live Demo showcased BlockDAG’s mining products, with the X10 hardware miner producing up to 200 BDAG daily and the X1 mobile app delivering up to 20 BDAG daily, both built for easy operation. Sports sponsorships with the Seattle Seawolves and Seattle Orcas have boosted brand visibility, integrating NFTs, fan tokens, and digital engagement into mainstream sports. With 20 confirmed exchange listings, a hybrid blockchain-DAG structure for high-speed transactions, and over 2.5 million X1 app users, BlockDAG is functioning like an established ecosystem before launch. This combination of product delivery, partnerships, and favourable pricing keeps it in focus as the top crypto to buy in 2025 . The Closing Note Avalanche is supported by rising TVL and aligned technical signals, with the Avalanche (AVAX) Price Prediction pointing toward notable gains if resistance breaks. Shiba Inu’s firm base, bullish divergence, and ascending triangle keep it in breakout territory, as the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price analysis suggests. BlockDAG, however, stands out with $370 million raised, over 25 billion coins sold, a clear path to its $0.05 launch, and an active ecosystem already in motion. Between chart-driven plays like AVAX and SHIB and BlockDAG’s defined pricing advantage, the latter offers a structured route that’s hard for the market to overlook.

The amended filing does not include essential details such as the fee or a ticker symbol for the fund, Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out. Truth Social just filed an amendment to its spot bitcoin ETF. Not sure what was tweaked. No fee yet, which I am REALLY curious about. Also no ticker. I wonder what they’ll pick for ticker. Any guesses? pic.twitter.com/M4QZTTIKaM — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) August 11, 2025 Balchunas previously said that the spot ETF may struggle to stand out, given its late market entry and already crowded and competitive space. The spot Bitcoin ETF launch is subject to the SEC approval of the registration and Form 19b-4 , following which, the shares will be listed on NYSE Arca. Crypto.com will serve as the Bitcoin custodian and liquidity provider, while Yorkville America Digital will act as the fund’s sponsor, per a Monday release . If approved, “the ETF will hold Bitcoin directly and offer its shares to investors, aiming to reflect Bitcoin’s price performance.” New Amended S-1 Form Filed for Truth Social Bitcoin ETF The Monday SEC amendment filing to the original S-1 filed on June 5, 2025, lacked an explicit change summary . However, it reflected updates from June to August 2025 based on comparisons, including recent events and refined disclosures. For instance, the new S-1 added details on the Digital Asset Cooperation Agreement from April 2025 and policies for handling Incidental Rights, such as airdrops. It also updated the CF Benchmarks Index platforms and clarified operational procedures for share creations and redemptions. On the risks and regulatory front, the changes include expanding on recent events, like the GENIUS Act, adding stablecoin risks. Additionally, it included discussions on hard forks and regulatory developments up to August 2025, such as executive orders. Further, the filing amended the Trust Agreement to a restated version dated in 2025. Trump Media Joins Wall Street Powerhouse Competitors The Bitcoin ETF market is already dominated by asset managers, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and Ark Invest. These firms have a strong investor base and a consistent record of offering low-cost, high-liquidity products. Given the high competition, Truth Social ETF might offer either much lower fees or a differentiated value to gain traction. On top of the pricing, the fund needs to build investor trust on par with established firms. Although there is no specific date for the launch, the decision to work with established infrastructure providers like Crypto.com might help the fund withstand regulatory scrutiny.

Japan outperformed as the Nikkei 225 jumped 2.6% to 42,942.14, a new record. Blue-chip stocks were firm, Toyota Motor Corp. rose 3.3%, while others also advanced. In contrast, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng eased almost 0.2% to 24,865.07. On the mainland, the Shanghai Composite inched 0.3% higher to 3,658.62. Gains followed a Monday executive order from Trump that temporarily halted escalation between the world’s two biggest economies, creating a window for broader talks. Without the delay, duties on Chinese imports could have risen from an already steep 30%. Beijing indicated it would mirror Washington’s extension by postponing its own tariff increases on U.S. goods. The extra time offers negotiators space to pursue a deal with Trump, yet businesses still face the planning uncertainty that has marked the conflict’s latest phase. “The extension isn’t about goodwill; it’s about keeping oxygen in the room for deals that matter,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. Across Asia-Pacific , Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was essentially flat, up less than 0.1% at 8,852.80, while South Korea’s Kospi rose 0.6% to 3,227.10. US stocks dipped on Monday In the U.S., stocks dipped Monday as investors awaited new inflation figures. The S&P 500 fell 0.3% to 6,373.45 after lingering near its record from two weeks earlier. The Dow declined 0.5% to 43,975.09, and the Nasdaq lost 0.3% to 21,385.40. The week’s marquee U.S. release arrives Tuesday with July’s consumer price index. Economists expect a 2.8% year-over-year rise in prices, above June’s 2.7%. Currencies were calm ahead of the data. The dollar retained recent strength as traders weighed how the CPI could shape expectations for future Federal Reserve rate cuts. The Australian dollar was little moved in the run-up to the Reserve Bank of Australia’s decision. Dollar is holding gains The dollar index , a gauge versus six currencies including the euro and yen, was at 98.497 at 0046 GMT after a two-session gain of 0.5%. Earlier, the greenback had retreated as markets responded to Trump’s dovish-leaning pick for a Fed governor and to like-minded names for the chair, nudging bets toward more easing. On Tuesday, the dollar ticked up 0.1% to ¥148.28, while the euro held near $1.1615. Traders largely took the tariff move in stride, having broadly expected a three-month extension. As Washington and Beijing seek to avert triple-digit import duties, a U.S. official told Reuters that chip makers Nvidia and AMD agreed to allocate 15% of China-related sales revenue to the U.S. government in exchange for export licenses for certain semiconductors. The report underscored how trade and tech policy remain intertwined despite the truce. For the moment, the delay in higher tariffs afforded equities some relief, even as focus turned to the inflation print and to whether talks can convert the pause into something more durable.

While headlines often spotlight DOGE’s wild swings or meme-driven rallies, whispers now point to something different, whales quietly building positions in Remittix that’s nearing a major exchange reveal. The buzz across Twitter and forums hints at Remittix’s subtle yet steady rise in the shadows of meme mania. Along with this action behind the scenes, Dogecoin stays in the spotlight. Whale hoarding, high volume and fanciful signs of a breakout are being monitored by market watchers and these phenomena could trigger renewed interest in crypto assets that have a practical application. Dogecoin Whale Strategy: Accumulate Now for Next Move Dogecoin whales added a staggering 230 million DOGE in just 24 hours, sending prices from around $0.20 to above $0.23, signaling potential for a breakout toward $0.29 if support holds strong . Analysts like Ali Martinez confirm this surge marks renewed confidence, possibly anticipating macro events that could shift sentiment across altcoins. He also stated that once the Dogecoin price clears $0.36, the path is clear towards $0.70 . Best Crypto to Buy: Remittix Nears $20 Million Milestone With Real Utility Remittix is quietly turning heads with its pragmatic PayFi technology. This Remittix DeFi project recently revealed its wallet in beta and is on track for a Q3 launch. Without flashy hype, it builds utility-first infrastructure focused on fast, low-cost crypto-to-fiat transfers and secure, cross-border payments. Compared with meme-driven DOGE rallies, Remittix stands on solid ground. Its design prioritizes adoption and usability. The platform boasts staking, low gas fees and a focus on merchant and freelance workflows, which makes it a strong contender among low gas fee crypto projects and a real-use crypto with passive income potential.

That reveal could catapult its profile, delivering visibility, liquidity and mainstream access key factors for long-term momentum. Utility Outpaces Hype: Remittix’s Quiet Strength DOGE’s whale-backed move reminds us of speculative momentum’s power. But when the whales themselves pivot to crypto solving real-world problems, that’s a signal worth noticing. For those hunting the next big altcoin 2025 or a best long term crypto investment, Remittix offers substance not just spectacle.

In the meme coin jungle of 2025, timing isn’t just important, it’s everything. Between Snek making waves on Cardano, Gigachad building its own crypto cult, and a live presale where staking pays double-digit APY before the token even launches, there’s serious money being made by those moving fast. The Top Meme Coins to Invest are the ones where momentum meets mechanics. Troller Cat is sitting in Stage 17 of its presale, with over $450,000 already raised and a projected ROI of 2,471.80% at listing. Prices climb every stage, so hesitation costs you entry power. Miss this window, and you’re watching from the sidelines while others cash in. 1. Troller Cat ($TCAT) Right now, Trollercat presale is priced at $0.00012859. That’s up from its humble $0.00000500 launch in Stage 1, with 17 of 26 stages complete and over 1,700 holders already on board. When it lists at $0.0005309, buyers today could be looking at gains north of 312%, and that’s just from price action, not the extras. This presale is anything but boring. Each stage celebrates a legendary trolling stunt, with Stage 17 honoring the cheeky “Short Shorts” jab at Wall Street. The branding is fun, the vibe is unapologetically mischievous, but under the surface sits an Ethereum-based project with a verified audit, KYC clearance, a deflationary Play-to-Earn Game Center, and a staking feature that’s drawing in yield hunters as fast as meme lovers. Staking With 69% APY Staking during a presale is rare. Staking at 69% APY while the price is still climbing? That’s almost unheard of. Trollercat lets you lock tokens instantly after buying, with rewards distributed automatically. You can unstake anytime, but to keep whales from dumping, the earned rewards stay locked for two months post-launch, a move designed to maintain price stability after listing. Picture this: invest $3,000 in Stage 17 at $0.00012859, hold until it hits $0.0005309, and you’re looking at around $12,390 from price appreciation alone. Factor in two months of staking rewards at 69% APY, and you’ve got a return that can pay off a loan, fund a trip, or even roll into your next big trade. That’s why $TCAT isn’t just another presale, it’s one of the Top Meme Coins to Invest if you want your bag to work overtime before it even hits the market. Why This Coin Made It to the List: High-yield staking, deflationary burns, and staged price growth make Troller Cat one of the smartest meme plays of the year. 2. Snek ($SNEK) Snek’s rise on the Cardano network has been nothing short of explosive. Its snake-themed branding resonates with a broad crypto audience, but it’s more than a meme; the token boasts consistent liquidity, an active DAO-driven treasury, and a steady schedule of token burns that support price stability. Holders participate in “Snek Challenges” for rewards, and Cardano’s low transaction fees make onboarding cheaper for new investors. The project also benefits from Cardano’s growing DeFi scene, with partnerships forming between Snek and Cardano-native dApps to create staking pools and yield opportunities. This cross-integration keeps the token relevant beyond just hype cycles, giving it real staying power in the Top Meme Coins to Invest category. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Low fees, consistent burns, and integration with Cardano DeFi make Snek an attractive long-term meme asset. 3. Gigachad ($GIGA) Gigachad has mastered the art of branding in crypto. It’s positioned as the ultimate “alpha” coin, with its community members calling themselves “The Chad Army.” Weekly meme battles, influencer partnerships, and competitive challenges create constant buzz, while the project’s tokenomics limit supply to create scarcity. Gigachad also invests heavily in social presence, dominating TikTok and Twitter with high-quality meme videos that spread virally. On-chain, GIGA runs a staking program with flexible terms, and plans to release an NFT series featuring rare Chad characters that double as governance passes. These mechanics turn GIGA from a short-term pump into a potential Top Meme Coins to Invest contender with real community engagement. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Scarcity, nonstop viral marketing, and an engaged holder base give GIGA the hype and structure to perform. 4. ANDY ($ANDY) ANDY’s strategy is pure nostalgia meets innovation. By reviving a beloved meme character, the project taps into long-standing internet culture while introducing gamified leaderboards for top holders. Holders can earn points by staking, trading, or participating in community challenges, and those points translate into airdrops or exclusive NFTs. The token supply is structured to reward long-term holders, with a portion locked for liquidity and community incentives. Strategic partnerships with meme NFT marketplaces ensure that ANDY’s branding stays visible across Web3 spaces, keeping it firmly on the Top Meme Coins to Invest radar. Why This Coin Made It to the List: A mix of nostalgia, gamification, and consistent visibility makes ANDY stand out from the crowd. 5. Coq Inu ($COQ) Coq Inu thrives on humor, leaning into rooster memes while adopting proven Inu coin strategies. It’s not just for laughs, the project runs seasonal token burns, charity drives for animal welfare, and meme creation contests that keep its social platforms active. The token’s smart contract is designed for transparency, with liquidity locked to ensure stability. COQ has also experimented with “Meme Farming,” a system where users submit content and earn tokens based on community votes. This interactive model pushes it into the Top Meme Coins to Invest conversation by turning holders into active brand builders.

The Malaysian Central Bank , officially known as Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), published a working paper that delves into the intriguing possibility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ripple (XRP) serving as future monetary alternatives . This isn’t just a casual observation; it suggests these digital assets could potentially replace traditional currency in circulation or bank deposits, becoming widespread payment methods outside the conventional banking system. This exploration by the Malaysian Central Bank signals a growing acknowledgment of digital currency ‘s evolving role in global finance. What Did the Malaysian Central Bank Paper Reveal? The working paper, a significant document from the Malaysian Central Bank , explored various scenarios where cryptocurrencies might fit into the nation’s financial landscape. It specifically highlighted Bitcoin and XRP as examples of digital assets with the potential to act as substitutes for existing money forms. The paper considered cryptocurrencies as potential replacements for traditional currency in circulation (CIC). It also looked at their capacity to serve as alternatives to bank deposits. Crucially, the study envisioned these digital assets becoming widespread payment methods, operating independently of the established banking infrastructure. This detailed analysis from a central bank is a powerful indicator of the shifting perspectives on cryptocurrency adoption . Why Are Bitcoin and XRP Being Considered as Monetary Alternatives? The paper’s focus on Bitcoin XRP is particularly noteworthy. Both assets possess unique characteristics that make them intriguing candidates for future payment systems. Bitcoin, known for its decentralization and robust network, offers a censorship-resistant form of value transfer. XRP, on the other hand, is celebrated for its speed and low transaction costs, making it appealing for cross-border payments. The discussion revolves around their ability to facilitate transactions efficiently and offer a degree of independence from traditional financial intermediaries. As the world becomes increasingly digital, the appeal of a streamlined digital currency for everyday transactions grows stronger. Challenges and Opportunities for Cryptocurrency Adoption While the prospect of cryptocurrencies as monetary alternatives is exciting, the Malaysian Central Bank ‘s paper also implicitly acknowledges the challenges. Regulatory frameworks, consumer protection, price volatility, and scalability are all crucial considerations that need addressing before widespread cryptocurrency adoption can occur. However, these challenges also present opportunities for innovation and collaboration between traditional finance and the crypto sector. Key Considerations: Regulatory Clarity: Clear rules are essential for mainstream integration. Consumer Protection: Safeguarding users from risks like fraud and loss. Price Stability: Addressing volatility to ensure cryptocurrencies can function as a reliable store of value. Technological Infrastructure: Building robust systems to handle high transaction volumes. Overcoming these hurdles will pave the way for a more integrated and efficient financial future. What Does This Mean for the Monetary Future? The fact that a major institution like the Malaysian Central Bank is openly discussing Bitcoin XRP and other digital assets as potential replacements for traditional money is a significant paradigm shift. It indicates that central banks worldwide are seriously evaluating how digital innovations will reshape the financial landscape. This isn’t about replacing fiat currency overnight, but rather acknowledging the growing demand for and potential of decentralized and digital forms of money. This exploration by the Malaysian Central Bank could inspire other nations to conduct similar studies, accelerating the global conversation around digital currency and its role in our collective monetary future . The financial world is undoubtedly on the cusp of profound transformation. The working paper from the Malaysian Central Bank represents a pivotal moment in the ongoing narrative of cryptocurrencies. By openly considering Bitcoin and XRP as viable monetary alternatives , Malaysia has signaled a forward-thinking approach to the evolving financial landscape. While significant challenges remain, this official acknowledgment underscores the irreversible trend towards cryptocurrency adoption and the increasing prominence of digital currency in our lives. The journey towards a more digitally integrated financial system is underway, and nations like Malaysia are at the forefront of this exciting exploration. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly did the Malaysian Central Bank’s paper say about Bitcoin and XRP? The working paper from the Malaysian Central Bank (BNM) stated that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ripple (XRP) could potentially serve as widespread payment methods, replacing traditional currency in circulation or bank deposits outside the conventional banking system. Q2: Does this mean Malaysia will adopt Bitcoin and XRP as official currencies soon? Not necessarily. The paper is a working document exploring potential scenarios and implications. It indicates that the Malaysian Central Bank is studying the feasibility and impact of such a shift, but it does not confirm immediate plans for adoption as official currencies. Q3: What are the main benefits of using cryptocurrencies as monetary alternatives? Benefits include potentially lower transaction costs, faster cross-border payments, increased financial inclusion for the unbanked, and greater efficiency compared to traditional banking systems, especially for specific cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin XRP. Q4: What challenges does the Malaysian Central Bank likely consider for cryptocurrency adoption? Key challenges include regulatory uncertainty, price volatility of cryptocurrencies, consumer protection issues, cybersecurity risks, and the need for robust technological infrastructure to handle large-scale transactions. These factors are crucial for successful digital currency integration. Q5: How does this development compare to other countries’ approaches to digital currency? Many central banks globally are exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) or researching the implications of private cryptocurrencies. The Malaysian Central Bank’s explicit mention of Bitcoin and XRP as potential monetary alternatives, rather than solely focusing on CBDCs, positions it among the more open-minded institutions regarding existing decentralized digital assets.

Gains were broad across majors as XRP (XRP) climbed 3.2% to above $3.16, Solana’s SOL (SOL) rose 5.2% to $176, dogecoin (DOGE) rose 5.7% to 22 cents, and Binance’s BNB (BNB) added 1.2% to $800. Lido’s staked ether mirrored ETH’s move with an 18% weekly gain. The global cryptocurrency market cap rose to $4 trillion, according to CoinGecko. This week’s rally has flipped the usual dynamic, with altcoin strength dragging BTC higher instead of the other way around. “This is one of the few times when a rally in major altcoins has inspired BTC to break through,” said Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro. He noted BTC has already cleared the $120,000 technical barrier, with “the bull’s nearest target now looking to be the $135,000–$138,000 area.” ETH’s outperformance has been bolstered by pro-crypto U.S. legislation and heavy ETF inflows. “Ethereum has gained over 21% in seven days and 45% in the last 30 days,” Kuptsikevich said, adding that the token’s on-chain activity and address growth are nearing historical highs. “We would not be surprised to see its $4,800 peak updated in the coming days.” Macro correlations remain tight with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are trading near records, shrugging off fresh U.S. tariffs and political drama. The consensus for today’s CPI is a 10-basis-point uptick to 2.8% annual inflation. QCP Capital said in a client note that a softer reading “would likely lock in September rate cut expectations” — now near 100% odds after dovish Fed commentary — while a hotter print could stall the rally. Derivatives flows show traders hedging CPI event risk, with front-end BTC puts in the $115,000 – $118,000 range seeing heavier demand, QCP said, even as short-call covering adds fuel to the upside. BTC ETF inflows and institutional positioning will be critical in determining whether resistance at $122,000 – $124,000 breaks before the week’s end, the firm ended.

After breaking above $122k on Sunday, Bitcoin has now dropped below $119k after losing 2.3% of its value in the last 24 hours. Altcoins are also in the red, with memecoins recording huge losses due to their volatile price actions. BONK, the native token of the Bonk ecosystem, is the worst performer among the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap. It is down 12% in the last 24 hours and could dip further if the bearish trend continues. BONK gets a $25m corporate treasury boost BONK’s poor performance comes despite the ecosystem getting a corporate treasury boost. Nasdaq-listed Safety Shot (SHOT) announced on Monday that it has taken a 10% revenue stake in Bonk.fun, among the largest memecoin launchpads on Solana. This latest development means that Safety Shot will receive $25 million worth of BONK for its treasury, aligning the public company directly with the platform’s growth. Furthermore, the Nasdaq-listed company revealed that it will issue preferred shares convertible into common stock and reinvest about 90% of its BONK.fun revenue into BONK token purchases. CEO Jarrett Boon pointed out that this latest development isn’t only about purchasing cryptos but acquiring a stake in “a highly profitable engine” within digital assets. Bonk’s launchpad, Bonk.fun, generated over $35 million in user fees in July, surpassing rival Pump.fun to become the highest-earning memecoin launchpad last month. Currently, Bonk.fun accounts for more than 80% of Solana’s daily new token launch market share. At its peak, the launchpad records over 20,000 tokens deployment, with daily volume surpassing $100 million. However, the corporate treasury boost didn’t result in the BONK’s price soaring higher as the broader crypto market recorded massive sell-off in the last 24 hours. BONK could bounce back $0.000030 despite bearish conditions The BONK/USD 4-hour chart is bullish and efficient despite the heavy selloff in the last 24 hours. The bullish chart suggests that there is no major break of structure to the downside and that buyers are still in control despite the ongoing correction. However, the technical indicators are getting weak, indicating that the bullish bias might change soon if the current trend continues. The MACD lines are crossing into the negative territory, indicating a pending bearish bias. Furthermore, the RSI has dropped to the neutral 50, suggesting that buyers are losing control of the market. If the bearish trend continues, BONK could drop below the TLQ and major support level at $0.00002358 in the coming hours. An extended bearish run would see BONK fall below $0.000020 for the first time this month. However, the market could bounce back on positive CPI inflation report later today. If that happens, BONK could quickly reclaim the first major resistance level at $0.02880. It could extend its rally towards $0.00003280 if the market pumps harder.

The filing follows the enactment of the GENIUS Act, the first federal framework for stablecoin issuers, which bans yield-bearing stablecoins. Industry experts believe this will accelerate capital into tokenized assets as institutions look for compliant ways to earn yield. Paxos’ move also happened after a $48.5 million NYDFS settlement and during a time of growing momentum for tokenization in markets. Paxos Eyes Federal License Paxos Trust Company, the crypto infrastructure firm behind PayPal’s PYUSD stablecoin, filed to convert its New York limited-purpose trust charter into a US national trust bank charter, reviving its effort that expired in 2023. If approved, the federal charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) will allow Paxos to custody customer assets and settle payments nationwide under federal oversight. This could potentially make the company more attractive to institutional clients. Unlike traditional banks, national trust banks are not permitted to accept cash deposits or issue loans. Paxos co-founder and CEO Charles Cascarilla said OCC oversight will strengthen the company’s long-standing commitment to safety and transparency. Press release from Paxos The renewed application was filed after the expiration of Paxos’ original federal charter approval. The company first applied in December of 2020 and received preliminary conditional approval in April of 2021, which allowed it to work toward meeting capital, compliance, and operational requirements before launching. However, OCC rules stipulate that conditional approvals expire after 18 months if the bank is not opened, and Paxos’ authorization lapsed on March 31, 2023. During that time, the firm continued to operate under its New York limited-purpose trust charter, which it has held since 2015 , and expressed interest in pursuing federal oversight when the timing was more favorable. The expiration came during a period of mounting regulatory pressure, particularly surrounding Paxos’ relationship with Binance. In February of 2023, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) ordered Paxos to stop issuing Binance USD due to compliance concerns, which ultimately ended its partnership with the exchange. This scrutiny culminated recently when Paxos agreed to a $48.5 million settlement with the NYDFS over alleged failures to maintain adequate anti-money laundering safeguards during its dealings with Binance. The agreement includes a $26.5 million fine and a $22 million investment in strengthening its compliance program. Announcement from the NY Department of Financial Services Paxos’ renewed application also came shortly after the enactment of the GENIUS Act, which is the first federal framework for stablecoin issuers. Similar charter applications were also filed by companies like Ripple and Circle. GENIUS Act Fuels Tokenization Shift The recently enacted US GENIUS Act could become a major driver of stablecoin adoption both domestically and globally, but its impact may go beyond boosting demand for dollar-backed digital currencies. Industry experts believe the law could unintentionally accelerate capital flows into the tokenization market as investors search for yield on their holdings. One of the central provisions of the GENIUS Act is its prohibition on yield-bearing stablecoins, which prevents holders from earning interest on their digital dollar balances. According to Will Beeson, former Standard Chartered executive and founder of Uniform Labs, this restriction will push t institutions to look for compliant avenues to earn yield while maintaining liquidity. He said in an interview that trillions of dollars in non-interest-bearing stablecoins are poised to enter the digital finance space, and institutional holders are unlikely to sit on idle, depreciating assets. Instead, they will demand yield and infrastructure that allows seamless, compliant access to it. Beeson believes the focus will shift from merely holding stablecoins to enabling programmatic access to risk-free yield and the ability to move between cash and high-quality assets on demand. Aptos Labs’ Solomon Tesfaye, also sees tokenization benefiting as much as stablecoins from the GENIUS Act’s framework. To meet this demand, Uniform Labs is developing Multiliquid, an institutional liquidity layer for tokenized markets that facilitates programmable, real-time conversion between tokenized assets — like US Treasurys and money market funds — and stablecoins. The platform’s open architecture allows compliant issuers to integrate without commercial agreements. While Beeson declined to name partners, he confirmed that Uniform Labs is collaborating with several leading institutions, fintech firms, and stablecoin issuers ahead of its planned launch later this year. Before founding Uniform Labs, Beeson was chief product officer at Libeara, a tokenization platform incubated by Standard Chartered’s SC Ventures. The tokenization trend, according to World Economic Forum’s Sandra Waliczek , is set to expand beyond private credit and government bonds into asset classes like real estate and private equity. She pointed out that tokenization enables fractional ownership by breaking traditionally exclusive assets into smaller, more affordable units, thereby broadening access to a wider range of investors.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|FIAT|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-12 05:30:00

Despite reaching such lofty levels, a prominent analyst suggests that the likelihood of a sharp market reversal is surprisingly low. This insight offers a compelling perspective for investors and enthusiasts alike, challenging conventional wisdom about market peaks. Understanding Current Bitcoin Price Dynamics Axel Adler Jr., a seasoned analyst from CryptoQuant, recently shared his expert observations on X, highlighting a crucial aspect of the current market cycle. He noted that Bitcoin’s (BTC) realized profit-and-loss ratio is currently holding at an average level. This is a significant detail, especially considering the cryptocurrency’s proximity to its BTC all-time high . What does this mean for the everyday investor? Essentially, it suggests that the market is not exhibiting the same kind of overheated euphoria seen in previous bull runs. Therefore, the risk of a sudden, drastic correction appears mitigated. What Do Market Indicators Reveal About Bitcoin Stability? Adler’s analysis emphasizes that the current state of market indicators points towards unexpected Bitcoin stability . Unlike past cycles where extreme profit-taking behavior preceded significant pullbacks, the present scenario appears more balanced. This suggests a more mature market where participants are not rushing to lock in profits at the first sign of a peak. Realized Profit-and-Loss Ratio: This metric tracks the average profit or loss taken by investors when they sell their Bitcoin. An average level indicates a healthy, sustainable market, not one on the verge of collapse. Reduced Overheating: The absence of extreme greed or fear prevents the rapid accumulation of speculative positions that often lead to sharp corrections. This data-driven approach provides a more nuanced understanding of Bitcoin’s current position, moving beyond simple price action. Navigating the Crypto Market Outlook: Why Sharp Pullbacks Are Less Likely For many, the idea of Bitcoin nearing its all-time high without an immediate, sharp reversal seems counterintuitive. However, Adler’s assessment underlines that the likelihood of a sharp market pullback is currently much lower than during previous overheated cycles. This positive crypto market outlook is based on fundamental shifts in investor behavior and market structure. Previous cycles often saw retail investors piling in late, creating bubbles that were prone to bursting. Today, the market has matured, with increased institutional participation and more sophisticated trading strategies. This contributes to a more resilient and less volatile environment, even at elevated price levels. Actionable Insights for Bitcoin Investors Given these insights into Bitcoin price trends and underlying market health, what should investors consider? While no market is entirely without risk, the current data suggests a potentially less volatile path forward for Bitcoin compared to historical precedents. Investors might consider: Long-Term Perspective: Focus on Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential rather than short-term fluctuations. Diversification: As always, maintaining a diversified portfolio helps mitigate risks. Staying Informed: Regularly follow expert analysis and market indicators to make informed decisions. Understanding these dynamics can help you navigate the market with greater confidence and make more strategic investment choices. In conclusion, while the Bitcoin price flirts with new all-time highs, the underlying market structure, as highlighted by CryptoQuant’s analysis, suggests a period of surprising stability. The realized profit-and-loss ratio indicates a healthy, balanced market, significantly reducing the probability of a sharp, immediate reversal. This offers a reassuring perspective for those tracking the future of the crypto market, pointing towards a more sustainable growth trajectory rather than volatile boom-and-bust cycles. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does an average realized profit-and-loss ratio mean for Bitcoin price? An average realized profit-and-loss ratio indicates that investors are not excessively taking profits or incurring large losses. This suggests a balanced market, reducing the likelihood of a sharp sell-off or extreme FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt). Is a sharp Bitcoin market pullback completely ruled out? While the likelihood is significantly lower than in previous overheated cycles, no market movement is ever completely ruled out. External factors or unforeseen events can always impact the crypto market outlook . However, current internal market indicators suggest a reduced risk. How does the current market differ from previous BTC all-time high cycles? Unlike previous cycles, the current market shows more balanced profit-taking behavior and less speculative overheating. Increased institutional adoption and a more mature investor base contribute to greater Bitcoin stability , even at high valuations. What are key market indicators to watch for Bitcoin stability? Beyond the realized profit-and-loss ratio, other important market indicators include funding rates, exchange inflows/outflows, and on-chain metrics related to long-term holder behavior. These collectively provide a holistic view of market health. Should I invest in Bitcoin when it’s near its all-time high? Investing decisions depend on individual risk tolerance and financial goals. While analysts suggest reduced reversal risk, it is always prudent to conduct your own research, consider dollar-cost averaging, and consult with a financial advisor.

While digital assets often march to their own beat, traditional markets, especially the Asia FX scene and major currency movements, frequently set the stage for overall investor sentiment. The recent developments surrounding the US-China trade truce and the upcoming Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) decision are prime examples of how global macroeconomics can ripple through all asset classes, including crypto. Let’s delve into these pivotal events and their potential impact on your investment perspective. Asia FX: Navigating Post-Trade Truce Optimism Following the news of a tentative US-China trade truce, currencies across Asia have shown a modest upward trend. This cautious optimism stems from the potential easing of trade tensions, which have weighed heavily on regional economies for months. The prospect of reduced tariffs and a more predictable trade environment has provided a much-needed breath of fresh air for businesses and investors alike. Several factors contribute to this positive, albeit measured, movement in Asia FX : Reduced Uncertainty: A trade truce, even a partial one, removes some of the significant uncertainty that has plagued supply chains and investment decisions. This clarity encourages capital flow back into regional markets. Export-Oriented Economies: Many Asian economies are heavily reliant on exports. An improvement in trade relations with major partners like the US and China directly benefits their economic outlook, strengthening their respective currencies. Investor Confidence: As geopolitical risks subside, investor confidence tends to improve, leading to increased demand for Asian assets, including their currencies. However, it’s important to note that the gains have been ‘creeping higher’ rather than surging. This indicates that markets remain cautious, awaiting concrete details and sustained progress on the trade front. The long-term impact on Asia FX will depend on the full implementation of the truce and subsequent negotiations. The Steady US Dollar: A Haven Amidst Trade Truce Shifts? While Asia FX has seen some upward movement, the US Dollar has largely remained steady. This might seem counterintuitive given the easing of trade tensions, which traditionally might weaken the dollar as safe-haven demand diminishes. However, several underlying factors contribute to the dollar’s resilience: Safe-Haven Appeal Persists: Despite the truce, global uncertainties, including ongoing Brexit complexities and slower global growth, continue to support the dollar’s role as a safe haven. Investors still flock to the US Dollar during periods of broader market instability. Economic Data: Robust US economic data, particularly in employment and consumer spending, continues to paint a relatively strong picture for the American economy compared to other major economies. This fundamental strength provides a solid floor for the dollar. Interest Rate Differentials: While the Federal Reserve has signaled a pause in rate hikes, the interest rate differential between the US and many other developed nations still favors the US Dollar , attracting yield-seeking investors. Liquidity: The sheer depth and liquidity of the US Treasury market make the dollar an attractive asset for large-scale capital movements, maintaining its demand. The stability of the US Dollar suggests that while the trade truce is a positive step, it hasn’t fundamentally altered the broader economic landscape or eradicated all sources of global risk. Its steady performance acts as a barometer of underlying global confidence. Understanding the Crucial Trade Truce: What It Means for Global Currency Markets The recent US-China Trade Truce represents a significant de-escalation in a conflict that has rattled financial markets for over a year. While not a comprehensive deal, it involves several key agreements: Phase One Agreement: This initial agreement focuses on increased agricultural purchases by China, intellectual property protections, and commitments regarding currency practices. It also includes a partial rollback of some US tariffs. Postponement of Further Tariffs: Crucially, the US agreed to postpone a new round of tariffs that were set to take effect, providing immediate relief to businesses. Framework for Future Talks: The truce sets a framework for further negotiations, signaling a willingness from both sides to continue dialogue rather than escalate tensions. For Global Currency Markets , the impact of this Trade Truce is multifaceted: On one hand, it reduces systemic risk. When the world’s two largest economies are engaged in a trade war, it creates immense uncertainty that drives investors towards safer assets, often strengthening currencies like the US Dollar and Japanese Yen. A truce, even a fragile one, allows for some unwinding of these safe-haven positions, potentially benefiting riskier currencies and emerging market assets. On the other hand, the ‘Phase One’ nature of the deal means that significant issues remain unresolved. This lingering uncertainty prevents a full-scale reversal of trends. The market is effectively in a ‘wait and see’ mode, monitoring whether the truce holds and if further progress can be made. This cautious approach limits dramatic shifts in Global Currency Markets , leading to the observed ‘creeping higher’ rather than a strong rally in risk-sensitive currencies. The Trade Truce is a positive signal, but its long-term effects on global trade flows and currency valuations will depend on the commitment of both nations to its terms and the success of future negotiations. RBA Rate Decision: What to Expect and Its Asia FX Ripple Effect Beyond the geopolitical developments, central bank actions remain a primary driver for Global Currency Markets . The upcoming Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) meeting is a prime example, with market participants closely watching for any signals regarding monetary policy. The RBA Rate Decision is particularly significant for the Australian Dollar (AUD) and, by extension, other currencies in the Asia FX complex. Here’s what to expect and why it matters: Current Expectations: The consensus among analysts often leans towards the RBA holding its cash rate steady, especially after recent rate cuts and signs of stabilization in the Australian economy. However, the language accompanying the decision is paramount. Economic Indicators: The RBA’s decision will be heavily influenced by recent economic data, including employment figures, inflation rates, and consumer spending. Any surprising shifts in these indicators could prompt a different response from the central bank. Forward Guidance: More important than the immediate rate decision itself is the RBA’s forward guidance. Any hints about future rate cuts or hikes, or concerns about global growth and trade, will significantly impact the AUD. Potential Scenarios and Their Impact: RBA Outcome AUD Reaction Broader Asia FX Impact Rates Held Steady, Neutral Tone AUD relatively stable, minor fluctuations. Limited immediate impact; market looks to other factors. Rates Held Steady, Dovish Tone (hinting at future cuts) AUD weakens as future easing is priced in. Could put slight downward pressure on other risk-sensitive Asian currencies. Surprise Rate Cut AUD sharply weakens. Could signal broader regional economic weakness, affecting other Asia FX negatively. The RBA Rate Decision is a key event that could either reinforce the cautious optimism from the trade truce or introduce new headwinds for the Australian Dollar and, by extension, influence sentiment across the broader Global Currency Markets . Navigating Global Currency Markets: Interconnectedness and Future Outlook The intricate dance between the US Dollar , Asia FX , the Trade Truce , and the RBA Rate Decision highlights the profound interconnectedness of Global Currency Markets . No single event occurs in isolation; each factor influences the others, creating a complex web of cause and effect. Looking ahead, several key themes will continue to shape currency movements: Trade Dynamics: While a truce is in place, the full resolution of US-China trade tensions remains a long-term process. Any breakdown in talks or re-escalation could quickly reverse current trends. Central Bank Divergence: Major central banks, including the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, and Bank of Japan, are on differing monetary policy paths. These divergences will continue to create opportunities and challenges for currency traders. Geopolitical Risks: Beyond trade, geopolitical flashpoints, such as developments in the Middle East or political instability in major economies, can trigger sudden shifts in safe-haven demand, impacting the US Dollar and other major currencies. Economic Data: Fundamental economic data releases – inflation, employment, GDP growth – will remain crucial barometers for currency strength. Stronger-than-expected data can bolster a currency, while weaker data can lead to depreciation. For investors, understanding these macro drivers is paramount. While cryptocurrencies offer unique value propositions, their price discovery often occurs within a broader financial ecosystem influenced by these traditional market forces. Periods of stability in Global Currency Markets , driven by positive developments like a trade truce, can foster a more risk-on environment, potentially benefiting digital assets. Conversely, heightened volatility in traditional FX can spill over, creating uncertainty. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Currency Landscape In a world where Global Currency Markets are constantly evolving, here are some actionable insights for investors, regardless of their primary asset class: Stay Informed on Macro Events: Keep a close eye on major economic data releases, central bank announcements (like the RBA Rate Decision ), and geopolitical developments. These are often the primary catalysts for significant currency movements. Understand Intermarket Relationships: Recognize how different markets interact. For example, a stronger US Dollar might put pressure on commodity prices, which in turn can affect commodity-linked currencies in Asia FX . Diversify and Manage Risk: While tempting to chase short-term gains, a diversified portfolio can mitigate risks associated with sudden currency fluctuations. Understand your risk tolerance and adjust your positions accordingly. Monitor Trade Negotiations: The ongoing US-China Trade Truce and subsequent talks will be a continuous source of market sentiment. Progress or setbacks will have immediate implications for currency pairs. Consider Long-Term Trends: Beyond daily fluctuations, identify long-term trends driven by fundamental economic shifts, demographic changes, and technological advancements. These underlying currents can offer more sustainable investment opportunities. By adopting a comprehensive approach that considers both traditional and digital asset markets, investors can better position themselves to navigate the complexities of the modern financial world. Conclusion: A Cautious Path to Stability The current landscape in Global Currency Markets is characterized by cautious optimism. The tentative US-China Trade Truce has provided a much-needed respite, allowing Asia FX to creep higher and fostering a sense of stability. The US Dollar , meanwhile, has maintained its steady footing, reflecting both its enduring safe-haven appeal and the underlying strength of the US economy. As we look ahead, the upcoming RBA Rate Decision serves as a reminder that central bank policy remains a critical determinant of currency valuations. While the immediate future appears to lean towards stability, the fragility of the trade truce and the ongoing need for economic data to support policy decisions mean that vigilance remains key. For all investors, including those deeply invested in cryptocurrencies, understanding these fundamental shifts in traditional currencies is not just beneficial, but essential for making informed decisions in an interconnected financial world.

The online gaming marketer aims to form an Ethereum strategy amid growing interest from public institutions to establish ETH treasuries. Firms such as BitMine , EtherMachine, and BitDigital cumulatively hold billions of dollars in Ethereum. As of today, BitMine holds 1.2 million ETH, Bit Digital holds 120,306 ETH, and EtherMachine holds 345,362 ETH. Analysts say public treasuries could hold up to 10% of ETH Ethereum is currently trading at $4,229, up over 9.5% over the past week and 45.3% over the past month. The token is presently 13% of its all-time high of $4,878. A Standard Chartered analyst has projected that public Ethereum treasury firms would eventually control up to 10% the total circulating supply. Sharplink has incorporated its operations with blockchain-based financial management. Its management team revealed that holding ETH as a primary treasury asset provides them with a strong balance sheet and alignment with the growth of DeFi technologies. According to Strategic ETH data , ETH treasuries accumulated 1% of all ETH supply in just two months, with holdings worth $9 billion. Geoff Kendrick of Standard Chartered predicts that the figure could grow tenfold, and eventually, the firms will control up to 10% of the token supply. At least 75% of users on Myriad , a market prediction forum, believe that Ethereum will beat its record price before the end of the year. Kendrick cited BitMine and Sharplink as companies that have grown at twice the rate of Bitcoin treasury firms since June. He said that DeFi utility and regulation inefficiencies are the key drawbacks for institutions. Some analysts from Bernstein warned that liquidity issues and smart contract risks tied to stacking and DeFi participation add to the list of drawbacks faced by treasury firms.

Currently priced at $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, the token has already increased 250% from its initial offering price of $0.01. Investors have contributed $14,300,000 so far, securing over 670 million tokens. More than 15,100 holders are now in the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project. Phase 6 is progressing rapidly and selling out quickly. This opportunity to acquire tokens at $0.035 is swiftly diminishing. The subsequent phase, Phase 7, will commence shortly, featuring a 14.3% price hike to $0.04 per token. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will ultimately launch at $0.06. Buyers participating now potentially achieve a 400% return after the token becomes publicly available. This momentum positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a notable crypto to buy now. Ethereum’s meteoric ascent mirrors MUTM’s potential trajectory Ethereum established a legendary precedent for crypto investment growth during its formative years. Back in 2017, Ethereum traded near $8 per token early in the year. Consequently, its value experienced an extraordinary surge. By December 2017, Ethereum reached an astonishing peak price exceeding $1,400. This phenomenal climb represented a gain surpassing 17,000% within a single calendar year. Such explosive growth delivered immense returns for early participants. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) currently exhibits similar foundational strength and market positioning. Analysts consequently project that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could emulate Ethereum’s historic price trajectory. Specifically, they forecast Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ascending to $15 by the year 2028. This projection implies substantial long-term gains for current investors seeking the best crypto to buy now. Mutuum Finance core utility drives value Mutuum Finance (MUTM) functions as the essential fuel for its pioneering decentralized lending ecosystem. The platform uniquely integrates dual lending mechanisms: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). P2C lending provides its users with predictable returns of approximately 12% APY by tokenizing blue-chip assets into mtTokens. Conversely, P2P lending enables direct user-to-user agreements, which have the potential of generating more returns, including 33% APY on some assets, including FLOKI. This two-pronged model serves a wide range of risk appetites in the crypto market. Moreover, Mutuum Finance is based on a very efficient Layer-2 blockchain. This integration will lower transaction fees to an extreme and increase processing speeds to a great extent. Lower costs and faster transactions enhance accessibility, fostering wider adoption and increased token utilization. Consequently, the inherent utility creates consistent demand for MUTM tokens, underpinning its long-term value proposition as a prime crypto to buy. Robust security and community initiatives underpin confidence Mutuum Finance prioritizes platform safety and user trust above all else. The project recently finalized a comprehensive security audit conducted by CertiK, a leading blockchain security firm. CertiK’s rigorous assessment awarded Mutuum Finance (MUTM) an impressive security score of 95.00. Crucially, the audit uncovered no vulnerabilities within the scrutinized smart contracts. Moreover, Mutuum Finance has launched its official Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK. A substantial reward pool of $50,000 USDT is allocated for this initiative. Rewards are stratified across four tiers – critical, major, minor, and low, ensuring all vulnerability levels receive appropriate compensation. Additionally, Mutuum Finance is running a major giveaway event. Participants stand to win a share of $100,000 in MUTM tokens, distributed among ten fortunate winners, each receiving $10,000. Eligibility requires completing specific quests and a minimum $50 investment during the presale. A new dashboard also features a leaderboard tracking the top 50 token holders. These leading participants will earn bonus token rewards for maintaining their positions, encouraging long-term holding. Looking ahead Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines tangible utility with strong security and escalating presale demand, echoing the early promise seen in major crypto assets. Its structured path towards $15 by 2028 reflects calculated potential. Explore the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale immediately before Phase 6 concludes and the price advances.

It is currently navigating Phase 6, offering tokens at $0.035 each. This price reflects a significant 250% surge from its opening phase cost of $0.01. Phase 6 is progressing rapidly towards a sell-out. Consequently, the opportunity to acquire tokens at this level is vanishing quickly. Phase 7 will trigger a 14.3% price increase, setting the token cost at $0.04. The project has already achieved impressive milestones: raising $14,300,000, distributing over 670 million tokens, and attracting 15,100 holders since its presale began. Investors purchasing now potentially secure substantial future gains relative to the planned $0.06 launch price. Mutuum Finance presale reaching critical juncture Demand for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens is accelerating. Phase 6 participation is proving exceptionally strong. Investors recognize the narrowing window for entry at $0.035. Subsequently, the imminent shift to Phase 7 and its higher price point adds urgency. The project’s foundation appears robust. Security remains paramount; Mutuum Finance has successfully finalized its CertiK audit. This audit yielded an outstanding 95.00 security score, confirming a solid security posture. Complementing this, Mutuum Finance launched an official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. A substantial $50,000 USDT reward pool is allocated, tiered by vulnerability severity (critical, major, minor, low). This initiative incentivizes thorough scrutiny. Project utility driving token value Mutuum Finance (MUTM) transcends simple speculation; it offers tangible utility within decentralized finance. The platform is developing a sophisticated dual-lending ecosystem. This system integrates Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending mechanisms. P2C lending allows users to tokenize established assets like BTC or ETH, generating interest. Conversely, P2P lending facilitates direct negotiations between users, often involving higher-yield opportunities with assets like memecoins. This dual approach caters to varied risk appetites. Moreover, the platform plans to operate on a Layer-2 network. This integration promises drastically lower gas fees and faster transactions, enhancing accessibility and user volume. Therefore, increased platform usage directly fuels demand for the MUTM token, integral to staking rewards and platform operations. Price trajectory mirrors historic crypto rallies Analysts project a potential surge for Mutuum Finance (MUTM), reaching $18 by 2027. This prediction stems from concrete factors, not mere hype. Primarily, the fixed total supply of 4 billion tokens creates inherent scarcity. As platform adoption grows and token utility increases, demand should consistently outpace available supply. Furthermore, staking mechanisms and token buybacks will actively reduce circulating tokens, amplifying price pressure. Historical precedent offers a compelling parallel: Bitcoin (BTC). During 2017, Bitcoin’s price ascended dramatically. It climbed from lows around $1,000 early in the year to a peak near $20,000 by December. This represented a staggering 20x return on investment within approximately twelve months. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) exhibits similar potential catalysts: innovative utility, capped supply, and accelerating adoption during its formative stages. Post-launch, sustained growth could feasibly propel the token towards the $1-$5 range, establishing a foundation for the longer-term $18 target. Community incentives amplify momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) actively fosters a strong, engaged community. Excitement currently centers on a major giveaway event. The project is awarding a total of $100,000 in MUTM tokens. Ten fortunate winners will each receive $10,000. Additionally, the team introduced a novel dashboard feature. This includes a leaderboard tracking the top 50 token holders. These leading holders will receive bonus token rewards for maintaining their positions, encouraging long-term retention. Final opportunity before phase advance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands at a decisive threshold. Phase 6 offers the final chance to buy at $0.035. The project combines genuine utility, rigorous security validation, and strong market interest. Historical crypto prices, like Bitcoin’s 2017 ascent, demonstrate the explosive potential within the crypto market. Analysts see a credible path for MUTM to reach $18 by 2027, driven by its unique model and tokenomics. For investors seeking exposure to a promising altcoin with significant growth potential, acting before the Phase 7 price rise is critical. Secure your position in Mutuum Finance now.

Over the past month alone, the U.S. has unleashed a barrage of policy announcements, including: 401(k) Crypto Access Expansion : New rules allowing retirement savers to allocate a portion of their 401(k) plans to crypto assets, effectively democratizing access to digital assets for millions of Americans. Project Crypto : Announced by the SEC Chair, this ambitious initiative aims to position the United States as the crypto capital of the world by streamlining regulations and fostering innovation. The GENIUS Act : A landmark bill designed to boost blockchain adoption across sectors by funding research, incentivizing crypto-friendly startups, and creating clearer tax frameworks for digital assets. And it’s not just policy. Institutions are buying up Bitcoin and Ethereum at a record pace, while market analysts seem to be in a competition to outdo each other with bullish predictions. Now, while it’s relatively easy to pinpoint why crypto could thrive over the next year, five years, or even decade, identifying the next cryptos to explode is an entirely different ballgame. That’s why we turned to Gemini, Google’s homegrown AI chatbot with access to Google Search and cutting-edge analytical and narrative-building skills. This gives it the brainpower to digest the latest market developments, filter through the noise, and zero in on the best altcoins to buy right now . Keep reading to discover Gemini’s top picks, along with how each of them is uniquely positioned to deliver outsized gains in the months ahead. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bitcoin Layer 2 for High Speeds, Low Fees, and Enhanced Programmability Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a new cryptocurrency project aiming to tackle Bitcoin’s long-standing issues of slow speeds, high costs, and limited programmability, bringing its blockchain performance up to modern standards. Currently, Bitcoin’s base layer can process a grand total of just 7 transactions per second (TPS), while Solana can handle up to 3,000 TPS. Moreover, Bitcoin isn’t well-suited for DeFi or other decentralized applications, as it lacks native smart contract capabilities. Thanks to $HYPER’s Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, though, Solana’s lightning-fast transaction speeds, ultra-low fees, and full Web3 compatibility are now coming to Bitcoin. Simply put, the SVM allows Bitcoin Hyper to run Solana-compatible smart contracts and dApps directly on its Layer 2, unlocking high-speed DeFi trading, NFTs, gaming, lending, staking, DAO governance, and other Web3 use cases on the Bitcoin network. But how do you interact with this Web3 environment if Layer 1 $BTC isn’t compatible with Layer 2? This is where $HYPER’s decentralized, non-custodial canonical bridge comes in. It lets you seamlessly convert your original $BTC into ‘wrapped’ Layer 2-compatible $BTC, unlocking entry into the Bitcoin Hyper ecosystem. It’s worth noting that the bridge will also convert your wrapped tokens back into native $BTC whenever you choose. All you have to do is raise a withdrawal request on Layer 2. According to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction , the token could surge by up to 2,400% by the end of 2025, potentially hitting $0.32. Here’s how to buy $HYPER now for just $0.01265 and join one of this year’s hottest crypto presales, which has already attracted an eye-popping $8.5M in early investor funding. Visit Bitcoin Hyper for more information. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Powering One of the Best Non-Custodial Crypto Wallets Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the horsepower behind Best Wallet, a free crypto wallet that’s setting new benchmarks for usability while offering foolproof security through self-custody and other advanced features. As a self-custodial crypto wallet, Best Wallet gives you complete control over your private keys, ensuring only you can access your funds. Say goodbye to nosy third parties! Moreover, Best Wallet also integrates advanced encryption, multi-factor authentication, and safeguards against hacks, scams, and phishing websites, offering a comprehensive security suite. One of its biggest standouts, though, is the Presale Aggregator, which allows you to buy new meme coins on presale from directly within the app, i.e., without having to visit any external sites. Speaking of ease of use, it also lets you set up a new wallet in under 60 seconds, seamlessly exchange tokens across multiple blockchains, and even create separate wallets for different goals, like trading, HODLing, or staking. Want in? Buy Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , which could potentially make you a chunky 180% in gains over just the next few months, as it’s predicted to hit $0.072 by year-end . In addition to generous staking rewards (currently yielding 92%), holding $BEST also unlocks a bunch of exclusive perks, including: Reduced trading and fees Early access to tokens in the Presale Aggregator Governance rights The project has already amassed more than $14.6M in presale funding, with 1 $BEST currently available at a low price of $0.025475. Learn all about $BEST by visiting its presale website. 3. XRP ($XRP) – Payments-Based Crypto Gearing up for Another Rally Gemini rounded off its list of suggestions with a listed, proven performer that looks primed for another explosive rally in the coming weeks. Enter XRP ($XRP). One of the biggest positives for $XRP heading into August is the official end of its long-standing legal battle with the SEC , which wrapped up on August 7 when both parties filed a joint stipulation of dismissal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Additionally, growing anticipation over a potential XRP ETF approval is adding more momentum to the rally. According to the prediction market Polymarket, the odds now sit at 81% . An ETF would make it far easier for traditional investors to gain exposure to $XRP through regulated markets, potentially unlocking a surge of fresh capital. And there are plenty of technical positives, too. For instance, on the 4-hour chart, the token is bouncing off the 0.5-0.618 Fibonacci retracement zone, which is a key area that often signals the continuation of bullish momentum. Meanwhile, on the all-important daily chart, $XRP’s price remains above short-term EMAs such as the 10, 20, and 50, another classic indicator that buyers are still firmly in control. $XRP is currently trading around $3.15 , and based on the trading patterns outlined above, it could climb up around 8% (a conservative prediction) in its current rally, potentially setting the stage for a push toward new all-time highs. Conclusion All in all, asking Gemini for its help in crafting a crypto portfolio proved to be a smart move. The AI chatbot delivered a solid mix of low-priced, high-upside tokens like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , along with established performers with strong momentum, such as XRP ($XRP). That said, kindly remember that the crypto market is highly volatile, and investments in it carry risks.

A post referenced the SEC’s Litigation Release No. 26369, dated August 7, 2025, which confirmed that the Commission had reached a joint stipulation with Ripple Labs, along with executives Bradley Garlinghouse and Christian A. Larsen, to dismiss all pending appeals. According to the SEC’s statement, the stipulation covers both the Commission’s appeal and Ripple’s cross-appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. These appeals stemmed from the final judgment issued by the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York, which had imposed a $125,035,150 civil penalty on Ripple . The judgment also included an injunction prohibiting the company from violating the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933. JUST IN: THE RIPPLE CASE HAS FINALLY CONCLUDED, AS ANNOUNCED BY THE SEC IN A RECENT LITIGATION RELEASE! #XRP https://t.co/bCdVzn3OGq pic.twitter.com/OL3QrwabV4 — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) August 11, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 With the dismissal of the appeals , the district court’s final judgment remains in place. This means Ripple will be required to comply with the civil penalty and the injunction as previously determined. The SEC described this step as the conclusion of its civil enforcement action against Ripple Labs and its two executives, marking the end of nearly five years of litigation that began in December 2020. Market Response Following Amelie’s announcement, reactions on X varied, with some users commenting on the market’s immediate response to the news. An X user, Nipping Pre-Problems, remarked that the asset’s price had dropped by 5 percent. However, data from CoinMarketCap shows that XRP has declined by 1.31 percent in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $3.13. The conclusion of the case brings closure to one of the most closely watched legal disputes in the cryptocurrency sector. While the final judgment leaves Ripple with significant financial and compliance obligations, it also removes the uncertainty of ongoing litigation, potentially allowing the company to move forward with its operations without the cloud of pending appeals. In light of the SEC not indicating any further legal actions related to the case, this development marks the official end of a case that has influenced both regulatory discourse and investor sentiment in the digital asset market since 2020.

49958836,https://invezz.com/?p=2835215,1754977731,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,BTC slips 2.4% on tariff concerns; investors shift to crypto token eyeing $5,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/12/btc-slips-2-4-on-tariff-concerns-investors-shift-to-crypto-token-eyeing-5/,"Bitcoin (BTC)’s recent 2.4% decline amid rising tariff worries has sent ripples across the crypto market. While some investors remain cautious about the flagship cryptocurrency’s near-term prospects, many are now turning their attention to promising alternative tokens with strong fundamentals and growth potential. Among these, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a compelling choice, aiming for a $5 price target within the next few months. This ambitious projection is supported by concrete upcoming developments and a robust token utility framework that sets MUTM apart in the competitive DeFi landscape. Bitcoin (BTC) slips 2.4% Bitcoin (BTC) dipped 2.4% to ~$114,305, down from $117,100, amid renewed tariff concerns following President Trump’s proposed 25% levies on Canada and Mexico and 10% on China, announced August 1, 2025, per CoinCentral data. The decline, with a 24-hour trading volume of $58.8 billion, reflects broader market fears of inflation and economic slowdown, as tariffs could raise costs and delay Federal Reserve rate cuts. Technical indicators show BTC testing the $112,000 support, with an oversold RSI (29.5) and bearish MACD signaling potential further downside to $110,000 if breached. Despite $55 billion in ETF inflows and whale accumulation of 1,300 BTC ($127M), $195 million in long liquidations added pressure, per CryptoQuant. A rebound above $116,713 could target $120,000, but macro uncertainties, including a weak jobs report, cloud the outlook. Robust growth catalysts backing MUTM’s price surge Unlike many speculative tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s price outlook is firmly grounded in significant platform milestones that will unfold soon. The imminent beta launch of the Mutuum platform will coincide with the token’s listing, enabling users to interact directly with the lending and borrowing features. This real-world utility is expected to drive demand for MUTM tokens and validate the platform’s innovative dual lending system. This dual system consists of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending pools, which are secured by blue-chip crypto assets such as Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), providing users with steady returns and reduced risk. Alongside this, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending allows for more flexible, negotiated loans involving speculative tokens like DOGE and PEPE, catering to higher-risk investors seeking larger rewards. This unique combination broadens Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s appeal, tapping into different investor segments and expanding the ecosystem’s overall liquidity. Adding to this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing a Layer-2 scaling integration. This upgrade will dramatically reduce transaction fees and increase processing speed, two critical factors limiting widespread DeFi adoption today. The enhanced user experience and cost efficiency will likely attract a surge of new users, further boosting MUTM’s value proposition. Phase 6 of the presale reflects strong investor confidence, having raised $14.3 million with the token price set at $0.035. The project now counts over 15,100 holders, with 15% of the total token supply sold. Importantly, the next presale phase will bring a 15% price increase, pushing MUTM’s cost to $0.040. This price hike signals the last opportunity for buyers to enter at a discount before the platform’s growing utility and visibility push the token toward the targeted $5 mark. Staking rewards, stablecoin launch, and major listings to fuel demand Beyond lending, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to introduce a staking mechanism where users can lock their mtTokens in designated smart contracts and earn rewards in MUTM tokens. These rewards will be backed by protocol-generated revenues that the platform intends to use for buying back MUTM tokens from the open market. This mechanism is designed to create consistent token demand and a healthy price floor, supporting long-term holder value. Moreover, the upcoming launch of Mutuum’s decentralized stablecoin will add another layer of utility. This stablecoin will maintain a $1 peg through overcollateralized loans and dynamic governance controls, providing a reliable medium of exchange within the platform and attracting users who value stability amid crypto’s volatility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also planning listings on major global exchanges, including Coinbase, Binance, KuCoin, MEXC, and Kraken. These listings will significantly increase liquidity and accessibility for MUTM tokens, making it easier for a broader audience to buy, sell, and trade. Enhanced liquidity is a known driver of token price appreciation, as it encourages higher trading volumes and market participation. With these developments on the horizon, the case for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a $5 target token gains strong credibility. The platform’s strategic roadmap and diverse offerings—covering safe lending, high-yield borrowing, staking incentives, stablecoin issuance, and exchange accessibility—build a solid foundation for sustained growth. Investors now face a limited-time opportunity to secure MUTM tokens at $0.035 before the price climbs to $0.040. Entering this stage means joining a growing community ahead of multiple value-adding catalysts, positioning early buyers to benefit from the platform’s expanding ecosystem and anticipated market recognition. In conclusion, while Bitcoin (BTC)’s recent dip on tariff concerns has shaken some confidence, it opens the door for investors to diversify into high-potential tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The token’s $5 price target within months is backed by real platform utility, upcoming upgrades, and strategic listings. For those looking to capitalize on the next wave of crypto innovation, MUTM offers a rare blend of technological advancement and growth potential, making now the perfect moment to invest before the presale price moves higher.

The report, due at 12:30 UTC, is expected to show that the headline consumer price index (CPI) increased 2.8% year-on-year in July, up from a 2.7% rise in June, according to Bloomberg data. On a monthly basis, prices are forecast to increase 0.2%, a slight decline from July's 0.3%. The core CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy component, is likely to have risen 0.3% in July following a 0.2% rise in June. According to analysts, a hotter-than-expected CPI could dampen Fed rate cuts, potentially weighing on risk assets, including BTC. 'The market's immediate focus is on Tuesday's U.S. CPI print, with the market expecting a modest uptick to 2.8% YoY. A softer reading would likely cement a September rate cut by the Federal Reserve, a positive for risk assets. Conversely, a hotter print could stall the rally, triggering tactical profit-taking across risk assets,"" Timothy Misir, head of research at BRN, told CoinDesk in an email. Some traders are already positioning for a hotter print and potential losses in BTC. According to Singapore-based QCP Capital, the precautionary flow is evident from the increase in demand for short-dated put options. A put option protects the buyer from price losses in the underlying asset. ""In anticipation, some traders are hedging event risk, with front-end $115,000–$118,000 BTC puts seeing increased demand to protect against a downside surprise,"" QCP Capital's market insights team said Monday. ""This defensive positioning sits alongside short-call covering from topside buyers."" The covering of the short call positions indicates that traders also remain wary of topside risk.

He calls this an “unequivocal antitrust violation” and says xAI will sue immediately. Despite their popularity, the billionaire posted on X, accusing Apple of refusing to feature his AI chatbot Grok or the X platform in the App Store’s “Must Have” section. He said this selective promotion helps OpenAI and hurts fair competition in the AI market. Musk accuses Apple of blocking AI rivals in App Store promotions In a series of posts on X,musk Musk accused Apple of using its App Store policies and promotional choices in ways that give an unfair advantage to OpenAI. He said Apple also made it extremely difficult for other artificial intelligence companies, including his firm, XAI, to reach the top spot in the store’s rankings. Apple Store’s “Must Have” section highlights selected apps to millions of iPhone users and can dramatically influence downloads and popularity, so Musk focused much of his criticism on it. He claimed that Apple has refused to include X and Grok in this premium promotional space despite X being, in his words, the number one news app globally. He added that Grok, xAI’s chatbot, ranks fifth most popular app overall across all categories and points to decisions that could be politically motivated rather than factors like user demand or performance. Musk suggested that the company’s actions go beyond standard business choices and into territory that he believes violates antitrust principles by asking Apple directly if it was “playing politics” in deciding which apps to promote. The billionaire’s allegations remained unanswered because xAI, Apple, and OpenAI hadn’t provided any public response to requests for comment from reporters at the time of his statements. The timing of Musk’s comments is essential because they come during a period when he has been increasingly aggressive in challenging what he deems unfair or monopolistic practices in the AI industry. Musk builds on past antitrust fights with new threat against Apple Musk has challenged the influence, partnerships, and control of some of the most powerful tech companies over the past few years. The AI startup leader filed a high-profile lawsuit against OpenAI , its CEO Sam Altman, Microsoft, and several other parties earlier in the year. Musk accused them of creating contracts that primarily benefited their own financial interests and harming competition by setting strict limits on which investors could provide funding. He also called out OpenAI in the lawsuit for undermining its original mission by restructuring the company from a nonprofit research organization into a for-profit company. The tech billionaire’s lawsuit claimed these actions reduced consumer choice and increased costs. It lowered the overall quality of available AI products by violating the Sherman Antitrust Act—a key U.S. law designed to protect market competition. Musk and his team detailed a long list of transactions and business decisions that showed clear conflicts of interest involving Altman in the legal filing. These included agreements with companies such as Rain AI, Humane, and Limitless, where Altman allegedly held financial stakes. The report also presented a deal involving Reddit that Musk claimed boosted the value of Altman’s personal shares by hundreds of millions of dollars. Musk argued that these actions did not prioritize the best interests of OpenAI’s mission, but instead showed how Altman was steering the business toward arrangements that brought direct benefits. If the tech billionaire follows through on his warning, a lawsuit against Apple could quickly become one of the most closely watched cases in recent years.

Ethereum (ETH) has surged past $4,000 for the first time this year, buoyed by institutional inflows, record staking activity, and clear regulatory support for staking products. Analysts now see $4,100–$4,116 as the next key test before ETH can push toward the $5,000 mark later in 2025. Bitcoin (BTC) is holding firm above $116,000 after setting an all-time high in July. Institutional accumulation remains strong, and forecasts suggest BTC could target $124,000–$135,000 if current trends continue. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) is trading near $175 after defending support at $160–$165, boosted by technical upgrades, institutional partnerships, and speculation around a potential Solana ETF. In this shifting market, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are drawing fresh attention from investors seeking the road to the next parabolic bull run . Altcoin Season May Be Nearing The rallies in BTC, ETH, and SOL have fueled renewed optimism for high-upside altcoins. Market watchers note that capital rotation is underway, with investors moving from large caps into emerging projects with strong narratives and early-stage entry points. This shift has put the spotlight on a handful of presales that analysts believe could deliver outsized returns before Q4. Buying Pressure Rising — MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale Gaining Speed In this climate, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting significant attention. Buying pressure is rising, and the presale is gaining speed as allocation rounds close faster than expected. Positioned as a meme-powered altcoin and decentralized political memecoin , MAGACOIN FINANCE blends viral community appeal with governance-driven utility — a rare mix in the current market. Analysts project it could deliver significant upside, driven by scarcity in presale supply, a culturally resonant brand, and strong grassroots marketing. Blockchain data shows increased participation from wallets linked to Ethereum, XRP, and Solana holders, suggesting cross-chain investor interest. The presale’s pace has accelerated over the past two weeks, with fewer slots available each day. For many traders, the attraction lies not just in potential profits but in aligning with an anti-centralization ethos. This combination of cultural relevance, early positioning, and tightening supply is why MAGACOIN FINANCE is being highlighted as one of the Best Crypto Presale opportunities in 2025. Final Stretch Before Potential Breakout With Bitcoin consolidating near all-time highs, Ethereum eyeing $5,000, and Solana building momentum, the backdrop is favorable for early-stage altcoins. If market sentiment stays positive, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE could benefit from both speculative capital and long-term holders looking for differentiated plays. The coming weeks will be critical. Should ETH break above $4,116 and SOL clear $180, analysts expect fresh liquidity to pour into select presales. For now, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rapid presale uptake suggests it’s already on the radar for those seeking the Best Crypto Presale before the next market leg higher.

Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Fundamentals Clash With Short-Term Leverage Risks ZORA Hits New Highs On Monday, the native token of the decentralized social network Zora jumped nearly 50% to hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $0.145. The platform allows users to make social media posts into tradable tokens by automatically minting them, with over 2.06 million tokens created since its launch, according to Dune data. In April, the team launched its native ZORA token, airdropping 10% of the supply to early users. The launch received a negative response due to concerns of an unfair allocation and potential centralization. As the price nosedived within hours, some users considered the airdrop was “the biggest disaster with Scroll and Zksync” and the “biggest SCAM in 2025 so far.” Despite the initial backlash, the token has seen a remarkable performance since July, surging 1,573% in the monthly timeframe to hit a market capitalization of $438.9 million. Notably, its ongoing rally has been driven by numerous factors, including crucial integrations and large holders increasing their balances. Since mid-July, users can mint their tokens using the Zora platform without leaving the Base App, making it more accessible and convenient for investors. Following the integration, Base overtook Solana in terms of tokens launched. Moreover, Binance announced the launch of the ZORA/USDT perpetual futures trading pair with up to 50x leverage on July 25, a week after the Base App integration. The news fueled the token’s rally to its previous high of $0.09 on July 27. New Leading Launchpad? As noted by Base’s lead developer, Jesse Pollak, Zora led in tokens created by launchpads on Base and Solana last month, accounting for more token launches than leading Solana platforms Pump.fun and LetsBonk. The massive momentum was momentarily halted by the start-of-August pullback, which saw ZORA drop 50% from the July highs. Nonetheless, the token and the platform have seen a significant recovery over the past week, with its price rallying 128% and token creation activity surging nearly 27% since August 4. On August 10, the platform saw the largest token issuance since July 31, according to Dune data, with 47,743 tokens from 21,052 unique creators, seemingly driving ZORA’s Monday price breakout. ‘Onchain Culture’ Gets Momentum A week before ZORA’s launch, Coinbase’s Layer-2 (L2) Network, Base, faced backlash over rug-pull allegations after it promoted an unofficial memecoin that crashed by over 90%. As reported by NewsBTC, Base’s official X account posted an image with the text “Base is for everyone” and a link to Zora with the caption “Coined it,” sparking a speculative frenzy among the crypto community. Base explained that they had posted on Zora because they believe everyone should bring content on-chain and use the tools that make it possible. “Memes. Moments. Culture. If we want the future to be onchain, we have to be willing to experiment in public. (…) We’re going to keep bringing culture onchain,” the Base team argued. Related Reading: Ethereum Surpasses MasterCard In Asset Rankings, Bullish Targets Set Following Zora’s recent rally, market watcher Ansem highlighted that “Zora is currently the newest thing with the most momentum,” suggesting that “innovation will happen on base/abstract/megaeth/lighter & others,” instead of on the Ethereum mainnet.

Some show compelling chart setups. Others have the kind of adoption and utility that can outlast a single price cycle. Cold Wallet, SEI, Cardano, and Stellar are all drawing interest right now, but for very different reasons. From reward-driven ecosystems to bullish technical patterns and long-term blockchain upgrades, they’re each carving out a place in current market discussions. For those tracking the best crypto to buy now, the story isn’t just about which one moves first. It’s about which can keep moving. 1. Cold Wallet: Where Utility Meets a Rapidly Growing Base Cold Wallet’s booming presale is more than a token sale. It’s the entry point to a reward loop designed to grow with use. $CWT powers a system where wallet activity translates into value, from gas fee rebates up to 100% to cashback on swaps and ramps. The more tokens held, the more the rewards stack, creating a cycle where holding supports earning. Its reach expanded instantly with the $270 million Plus Wallet acquisition, adding over 2 million active users. Since then, the presale has become even bigger. With more crypto buyers getting on board, the Cold Wallet presale is now in Stage 17 at $0.00998. It targets a launch price of $0.3517. That’s a 3,423% ROI potential for those buying CWT now. Already, 692.2 million tokens have been claimed, bringing in $5.76 million into the presale. The 150-stage structure means each stage sold more tightly closes the gap between the presale price and the launch. Among the best crypto to buy now, Cold Wallet’s mix of ROI potential, immediate adoption, and ongoing rewards places it in a rare category. It’s positioned to deliver both on launch day and long after through its usage-driven earning system. 2. Cardano: Building on Its Long-Term Roadmap Cardano’s recent price of $0.72 sits well below its projected targets, but its technical and developmental activity is keeping it in view for long-term watchers. A break above the $1.35 resistance would be the first step toward its $5.00 goal, representing substantial growth potential. The network’s continuous blockchain updates and expanded smart contract capabilities are designed to attract developers and decentralized applications, creating a more active ecosystem. If adoption accelerates, these upgrades could translate into stronger price momentum. That combination of technology-driven expansion and a clear technical target is what keeps Cardano among the best crypto to buy now for a multi-year horizon. 3. SEI: Technical Patterns Hint at a Breakout SEI has been gaining traction among traders tracking chart formations that suggest upside potential. The double bottom pattern at $0.26 has acted as firm support, creating a base for upward movement. Adding to the case is a potential inverse head-and-shoulders setup, often read as a bullish reversal signal. Should SEI clear the $0.35 resistance, the next technical target sits near $0.50, with room for further expansion depending on market sentiment. These price structures, combined with the asset’s recent stability at key levels, have put SEI in discussions about the best crypto to buy now for those watching technical confirmations before a move. 4. Stellar: Strong Support and Bullish Indicators Align Stellar’s chart has shown several encouraging signals that reinforce its current upward bias. The double bottom at $0.2177 has held firm, acting as a launch point for higher moves. A golden cross formed in mid-July, where the 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day moving average, a widely followed bullish indicator. Alongside that, a falling wedge pattern is taking shape, which could trigger a breakout above $0.3355. Should that level give way, upside targets include $0.5183 and $0.6365. This confluence of technical factors places Stellar on the radar as the best crypto to buy now for traders prioritizing strong chart structures. Final Word: The Standout in This Lineup All of these four cryptos bring distinct strengths to the table, making them part of the best crypto to buy now. SEI is gaining traction with clear breakout signals. Cardano continues to build an advanced ecosystem primed for broader adoption. Stellar is aligning multiple bullish indicators for potential price acceleration. Cold Wallet’s edge lies in how it’s merging a large, ready-made community with a token model that embeds rewards into everyday wallet use. It’s not waiting for adoption to happen. It’s starting with it. That built-in momentum gives Cold Wallet a unique position to perform both at launch and in the cycles that follow.

Kazakhstan Agencies Clamp Down On Illegal Crypto Mining According to a statement released today, Kazakh financial and law enforcement authorities dismantled a large-scale operation in East Kazakhstan Oblast that illegally sold electricity to mining companies. The AFM and KNB said the stolen power could have supplied the needs of a small city in the region. Notably, employees of local utility providers had been illegally selling electricity to mining companies over the past two years. This energy was originally intended for the local population, social facilities, and enterprises of strategic importance. The crypto miners used over 50 megawatt-hours to mint digital coins during the period. The AFM noted that this level of energy consumption was comparable to that of a city with 50 to 70,000 residents. The miners consumed more than 50 megawatt-hours (MWh) of power during this period. The AFM said that this was comparable to the energy usage of a city with 50,000 to 70,000 inhabitants. Under Kazakhstan’s current laws, mining farms can purchase electricity only from a state-run platform operated by the Ministry of Energy. They are also limited to buying no more than one MWh at a time. Authorities estimate that over nine billion Kazakhstani tenge (approximately $16.5 million) worth of power was illegally supplied to the mining operations. The AFM revealed: The organizers used the criminal proceeds to purchase two apartments in the capital and four vehicles, which were seized with a court order for potential confiscation. Following China’s blanket ban on all crypto-related activities – including Bitcoin (BTC) mining – Kazakhstan emerged as a major hub for mining. While initially welcoming the industry, the country later faced rolling blackouts and grid breakdowns, prompting the government to impose tighter regulations on the sector. Crypto Mining In The Region Kazakhstan’s crackdown on crypto mining firms illegally using power is not an isolated case. Across the region, illegal mining operations have drawn increasing scrutiny from multiple governments. For instance, Russia recently warned that it will crack down hard on anyone mining digital assets without the necessary permissions. The country also recently introduced a national registry for cryptocurrency mining hardware. Elsewhere, France’s far-right Rassemblement National party recently announced plans to repurpose unused nuclear power for BTC mining, signaling a different approach to the energy demands of the industry. At press time, BTC trades at $120,260, up 1.3% in the past 24 hours.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|central asia|china|crypto mining|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|Kazakhstan|Russia,EN,0,0,MINING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|ASIA|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-12 06:00:39

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.65 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $4.14. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.8126 Market cap $856.27M Trading volume (24-hour) $27.44M Circulating supply 1.054B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.8864 24-hour low $0.8103 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 14.01% 50-day SMA $0.7122 14-Day RSI 62.29 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 70 (Greed) Green days 16/30 (53%) 200-day SMA $0.6456 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: XTZ faced rejection at $0.933, with selling pressure dominating both timeframes. The coin trades below its 20-SMA at $0.8706, creating overhead resistance. Tezos XTZ’s next significant support lies around $0.7200. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart The daily chart for Tezos shows the price currently trading at $0.8168 (August 11, 2025), having faced strong rejection after testing the upper Bollinger Band near $0.9330. The large green candle that pushed toward resistance has been followed by consecutive red candles, creating a classic rejection pattern that suggests sellers stepped in aggressively at higher levels. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The price now sits closer to the middle Bollinger Band around $0.8265, with support expected near the lower band at $0.7200. The MACD histogram remains negative, confirming bearish momentum, while the OBV at 1.1B indicates decent volume participation during this recent price action, though the selling pressure appears to dominate. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour timeframe shows a clear downtrend with XTZ trading below its 20-period SMA at $0.8706, which has now flipped to resistance. The consecutive red candles show persistent selling pressure without meaningful rebounds, while the Balance of Power indicator at -0.38 confirms that sellers maintain control over the current price action. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView Volume remains steady at 5.75M over 24 hours, but the consistent red candles suggest this volume is primarily driven by distribution rather than accumulation, creating a concerning technical setup for bulls. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.7985 BUY SMA 5 $0.8193 SELL SMA 10 $0.7922 BUY SMA 21 $0.8408 SELL SMA 50 $0.7122 BUY SMA 100 $0.6620 BUY SMA 200 $0.6456 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7847 BUY EMA 5 $0.7397 BUY EMA 10 $0.6825 BUY EMA 21 $0.6577 BUY EMA 50 $0.7031 BUY EMA 100 $0.8028 BUY EMA 200 $0.8764 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? XTZ faces continued downside pressure toward $0.7200 support, with any recovery needing to reclaim $0.8706 to shift momentum. The rejection at $0.9330 and persistent selling suggest further consolidation or decline before any meaningful bounce attempt. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing.

For that to happen, future price movements and an increase in Tezos’ adoption must be bullish. Tezos historic price sentiment Tezos price history ⏐ Source: Coingecko Tezos mainnet went live in September 2018 and immediately gained popularity for dealing with the environmental impact of blockchain technologies at that time with its PoS model. XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin recovered in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Despite the partnership milestones achieved, Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286. In January 2025, XTZ reached a maximum price of $1.49, but in February, it lost momentum, averaging $0.72 per unit. After a failed attempt at breaking above $0.80 in early March, XTZ managed a high of $0.6186 in April and $0.70 in May. XTZ maintained a trading range of $0.4752 and $0.6362 in June; in July, it maintained an average price of $0.7232. XTZ kicked off August at $0.7605 and is currently trading around $0.812.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|XTZ|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|FORKS|ETH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-12 06:08:08

49960531,553791,1754982042,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49960531.jpeg,South Korean Investors Shift To Crypto-Related Stocks Amid Stablecoin Push – Report,https://bitcoinist.com/south-korean-investors-shift-crypto-related-stocks/,"South Korean retail investors have recently shifted their focus when investing in overseas stocks, moving from US big tech stocks to crypto-related equities amid growing global interest in the sector. South Korean Investors Turn To Crypto Stocks Over the past few months, South Korean individuals investing in overseas stocks have shifted from US big tech equities to crypto-linked stocks, recent data showed, with a focus on stablecoin-related companies. Citing data from the Korean Center for International Finance (KCIF), Yonhap News Agency reported that the percentage of crypto-linked equities in the top 50 net-bought stocks by local retail investors increased from 8.5% in January to 36.5% in June before dropping to 31.4% last month. Meanwhile, net purchases of the top seven US big tech stocks declined nearly 74% from a monthly average of $1.68 billion between January and April to $440 million in May, further dropping to $260 million in July. According to the report, South Korean investors became net sellers of overseas stocks in May and June but returned to net buying in July with $499 million in purchases. Nonetheless, the new momentum was considerably weaker compared to the $3.8 billion monthly average buying between January and April. “Since June, the domestic stock market has outperformed overseas markets, while the local currency has strengthened, prompting individual investors to withdraw their investments from foreign markets,” Yonhap News Agency noted, citing the KCIF report. On Monday, Bloomberg also highlighted that South Korean retail investors have flocked to BitMine Immersion Technologies over the past month, as investors “continue to be drawn to the kind of high-risk, high-reward opportunities on offer in crypto.” The news media outlet reported that local retail investors have poured $259 million into Bitmine stocks since the start of July. According to Korea Securities Depository data, this made the company the most purchased foreign security stock during that period. Notably, BitMine is a Bitcoin and Ethereum Network Company “with a focus on the accumulation of Crypto for long-term investment.” It recently became the largest ETH treasury in the world and the third-largest crypto treasury globally, with its holdings surpassing 1.15 million ETH, valued at $4.96 billion at current prices. Retail Shift Fueled By Stablecoin Momentum According to the KCIF report, the surge in crypto-related equities, and particularly stocks related to stablecoins, follows the passage of landmark crypto legislation in the US. President Donald Trump signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act into law last month, setting a framework for much-needed stablecoin regulation and innovation in the country. Amid the US push, stablecoins have also seen growing momentum in several jurisdictions, including South Korea. In June, a member of the Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) proposed a comprehensive legislation to establish a more structured regulatory framework for crypto assets in the country, which included a licensing system for stablecoin issuers. In July, South Korea’s ruling and opposition parties also proposed rival bills to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets pegged to the Korean Won (KRW) to advance the ongoing efforts to institutionalize the sector. As reported by Bitcoinist, the banking sector is preparing for the upcoming legislation, studying two legalization scenarios, as it remains unclear whether non-bank entities will be allowed to be stablecoin issuers. The financial institutions are also considering a business model in which banks establish a joint venture to collectively issue stablecoins, and have reportedly contacted various non-bank companies to prepare for the legalization and issuance of KRW-pegged digital assets.",Crypto News|BitMine|Bitmine Immersion Technologies|Crypto Regulations|Crypto stocks|ETH|Ethereum|ETHUSDT|GENIUS Act|South korea stablecoins|South korean investors|Stablecoin Legislation,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|REGULATION|ETH|ASIA,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-12 07:00:42

Thanks to its new NFT integration announcement, the SOL price has relied heavily on its revived market belief. The altcoin price also rose recently and drew more interest. Nonetheless, while this Solana price prediction has brought interest to the DeFi project, a low-cap crypto gem is taking over the market and gaining traction for the solutions it delivers. This is more than hype. Savvy investors are considering diversifying into this more promising project, delivering real-world utility, low fees and a convincing prospect to change how cross-border remittance works while delivering skyrocketing profits. Solana Price Prediction: How High Can SOL Go? Analysts should keep a close watch on Solana’s price prediction and performance thanks to its recent surge. These analysts have attributed this to recent partnerships with new NFT gaming projects. The Solana price prediction for the short term sets a target beyond $200, while $300 could be tested next should momentum persist. Crypto experts believe the Solana price prediction leans towards a continuation of its higher low structure, which creates a bullish reversal from a key ascending trendline. The Solana Price prediction must follow up its recent rise with another bullish run in the coming week. Ending the coming weeks around $300 could spur the next rally toward $356.

Whale Activity and Rising Volumes In the last two days, large holders have purchased 900 million XRP, according to market analyst Ali Martinez. This activity follows the resolution of the long-running case between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission, with both parties agreeing to dismiss all appeals. 900 million $XRP scooped up by whales in 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/S9sDKwDu0t — Ali (@ali_charts) August 11, 2025 With the legal matter closed , interest from institutional traders has increased. Daily trading volume for XRP reached $8.77 billion in the last 24 hours, up 69% from the previous day. Open interest is also higher, indicating more active positions in the market. Price Levels to Watch Ripple (XRP) was priced at $3.13 at press time, showing a 4% decline over the past day but a 3% gain compared to a week earlier. The recent price movement follows two days of strong advances driven by clarity from the legal outcome. Ali noted that $3.27 is the key level to monitor. “Break it and $3.60 is next,” he said. On the 2-hour XRP/USDT chart, the price is moving within a downward channel. The $3.27 mark matches the top of that channel. A break above it could open the way to $3.37, then $3.51, and possibly $3.60. Support Zone and Trade Plans Analyst CrediBULL Crypto points to the $2.95 – $3.11 area as a preferred buying range. XRP is trading just above this zone and may dip into it before attempting to move higher. “As long as the green zone holds we can target range highs or new ATH,” he commented. His projection shows a potential rally from this range toward $3.6. If that level is passed, new all-time highs could be within reach. A drop below $2.95 would cancel this scenario. $ETH has been performing beautifully lately, but might be time for $XRP to take charge again soon… Downside target on XRP/ETH that was shared nearly 3 months ago has finally been met https://t.co/a7yQxWzwEx pic.twitter.com/n1z30HeCoP — CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) August 12, 2025 XRP’s regulatory clarity is a positive shift, but market sentiment remains tied to global factors such as trade tensions and monetary policy changes.

As per Fortune report , the stealth project represents Stripe’s most ambitious crypto initiative yet, building on its recent $1.1 billion acquisition of stablecoin infrastructure firm Bridge and purchase of crypto wallet developer Privy. The job advertisement, dated August 3 and subsequently removed after Fortune’s inquiry, described Tempo as Ethereum-compatible with a five-person team targeting Fortune 500 companies. Paradigm’s Matt Huang, who sits on Stripe’s board, is partnering on the blockchain development as the company builds a comprehensive crypto infrastructure spanning wallets, stablecoins, and now blockchain processing. Strategic Infrastructure Play Completes Crypto Stack Domination Stripe’s blockchain development follows a methodical acquisition strategy that began with Bridge’s stablecoin payment platform and continued with Privy’s wallet infrastructure . The Tempo blockchain would control the server layer processing stablecoin transactions, creating end-to-end crypto payment solutions. The company’s crypto journey started in 2014 as the first major processor supporting Bitcoin transactions. After halting Bitcoin support due to network inefficiencies, Stripe rebuilt its blockchain team in 2021 and accelerated crypto initiatives throughout 2024. Stripe launched stablecoin payments across 70 countries in October 2024, followed by Stablecoin Financial Accounts , enabling companies in 101 countries to hold and transact digital dollars. @Stripe has introduced a new financial tool designed to help businesses manage money using U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins. #Stablecoin #Stripe https://t.co/tyz9ujwsSm — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 8, 2025 The platform currently supports Circle’s USDC and Bridge’s USDB tokens. Earlier in May, the company partnered with Ramp to launch stablecoin-backed corporate cards addressing cross-border payment delays, high fees, and currency volatility. The cards initially launched in Latin American markets before expanding to Europe, Africa, and Asia. This strategic stablecoin front-running is not a coincidence. Stripe CEO Patrick Collison testified to Congress in March that the company sees “ meaningful business interest in stablecoins as the underlying technology has matured .” The GENIUS Act’s passage in July provided a federal regulatory framework spurring corporate adoption. Corporate Giants Rush Into Regulated Stablecoin Territory The stablecoin sector has exploded to over $250 billion in market capitalization following regulatory clarity from the GENIUS Act. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has recently projected stablecoin growth to $1-2 trillion within the next few years as corporations embrace digital dollar solutions. In light of this boom, a recent report covered by Cryptonews shows MetaMask is planning to launch “MetaMask USD” through a partnership with Stripe’s payment infrastructure, leveraging its 30 million monthly active users to challenge USDC dominance. @MetaMask plans USD stablecoin launch with Stripe partnership leveraging 30M user base to challenge USDC dominance as governance proposal reveals mmUSD details. #MetaMask #Stablecoin https://t.co/7M5ezSVd6t — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 6, 2025 The proposal outlines building on the M⁰ network with Stripe, providing regulatory clarity and fiat backing. Similarly, Western Union CEO Devin McGranahan announced pilot programs in South America and Africa to modernize remittance operations through stablecoins. Interactive Brokers founder Thomas Peterffy has also confirmed exploring stablecoin launches for real-time brokerage account funding. Additionally, Remitly launched beta testing for multi-currency digital wallets supporting fiat and stablecoins, with live deployment scheduled for September. The company integrated USDC into treasury operations while adding stablecoin payouts through Bridge infrastructure. The competitive landscape intensified with approximately 20 million addresses now transacting stablecoins on public blockchains. Amazon, Walmart, JD.com, and Alipay continue exploring stablecoin integration as adoption accelerates across traditional finance sectors. Notably, the massive adoption of stablecoin currently puts the US Dollar on the most beneficial side. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller recently acknowledged that 99% of stablecoin market capitalization links to the US dollar, believing “stablecoins can keep the dollar the world’s reserve currency” by increasing global accessibility. Looking forward, Stripe’s Tempo blockchain would position the $92 billion company to capture stablecoin transaction processing directly rather than relying on external networks. The Ethereum-compatible Layer 1 could facilitate instant adoption by leveraging Stripe’s extensive merchant network, which spans millions of businesses worldwide.

The growth, reported on Friday, was the strongest among America’s top fast-food names in the period, with McDonald’s seeing a 7.1% sales decline and Domino’s posting a 6.1% rise. The company began accepting Bitcoin (BTC) payments on May 16 across its US locations where permitted by law, as well as in France, Monaco, and Spain. The move, aimed at rejuvenating the brand and appealing to younger, tech-savvy consumers, has been credited with drawing cryptocurrency enthusiasts into its stores and improving operational efficiency. Steak ‘n Shake @SteaknShake · Follow In the second quarter of 2025, Steak n Shake’s same-store sales increased by 10.7%.Bitcoin has been a game changer. ⚡️Thank you Bitcoiners 🧡Bitcoin, Burgers & Beyond 🚀 1:58 am · 9 Aug 2025 5.3K Reply Copy link Read 210 replies Bitcoin brings cost savings and customer buzz Dan Edwards, Steak ‘n Shake’s chief operating officer, told attendees at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in May that the decision to accept Bitcoin had reduced payment processing fees by 50%. This cost saving, he noted, benefits both the company and customers, positioning Bitcoin as a “win for everyone involved.” On its opening day for Bitcoin payments, the chain accounted for 0.2% of all global Bitcoin transactions, underscoring strong initial interest from users. The company has since thanked Bitcoin supporters publicly, noting that their engagement has been instrumental in driving recent sales momentum. The rollout has made cryptocurrency payments available to more than 100 million customers across its domestic and international footprint. Edwards said the shift not only improves margins but also reinforces Steak ‘n Shake’s positioning as an innovative brand willing to meet evolving consumer preferences. Steak ‘n Shake US store count declines as it seeks to expand internationally While the Bitcoin initiative has delivered a sales boost, it comes against the backdrop of a significantly smaller store base. According to data from ScrapeHero, Steak ‘n Shake’s US store count has dropped from 628 in 2018 to 397 as of May 28, 2025 — a decline of over 230 locations. Florida remains the company’s largest market, with 79 stores representing around 20% of its total US presence. The company’s international Bitcoin rollout in France, Monaco, and Spain marks an attempt to diversify its reach and stay competitive despite its reduced domestic footprint. Industry implications and competitive edge The company’s outperformance in Q2 compared with other major chains has sparked interest in whether Bitcoin could emerge as a more mainstream payment option in the US fast-food sector. While Bitcoin is still used primarily as an investment in the US, Steak ‘n Shake’s results suggest there may be untapped potential for it as a retail payment method. An X post by Restaurant Business Magazine’s editor-in-chief Jonathan Maze on Friday showed the chain’s growth ranking above that of McDonald’s, Domino’s, and Taco Bell for the quarter. Jonathan Maze @jonathanmaze · Follow U.S. limited-service chain same-store sales from last quarter:McDonald’s 2.5%Starbucks -2%Taco Bell 4%Wendy’s -3.6%Burger King 1.5%Domino’s 3.4%Chipotle -4%Pizza Hut -5%KFC -5%Popeyes -0.9%Jack in the Box -7.1%Del Taco -2.2%Papa Johns 1%Dutch Bros 6.1%Sweetgreen 5:35 pm · 8 Aug 2025 499 Reply Copy link Read 61 replies This performance, paired with its public embrace of cryptocurrency culture, has positioned Steak ‘n Shake as an outlier in the sector. Despite these gains, the company’s future growth will depend on its ability to maintain momentum in a competitive landscape dominated by brands with larger footprints and deeper marketing budgets. The challenge will be to translate short-term buzz from Bitcoin adoption into sustained sales growth. If other fast-food operators follow suit, industry analysts say the impact on customer payment habits could be significant — potentially normalizing the use of digital assets in everyday transactions. For now, Steak ‘n Shake’s experiment with Bitcoin stands out as one of the most prominent examples of cryptocurrency integration in US quick-service dining.

Peirce had earlier tweeted , describing the development as “welcome for many reasons,” highlighting that it allows attention to move away from litigation and toward the creation of a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrency. She emphasized that with the case no longer demanding focus, there is an opportunity to advance policy discussions and regulatory clarity in the digital asset space. Peirce’s remarks align with her previously stated position that regulatory certainty is essential for both market participants and investors in the crypto industry. By highlighting the benefits of shifting away from legal disputes, Peirce underscored the importance of regulatory work that can provide clearer guidelines for the sector. Paul Atkins’s Response and Call for Action SEC Chairman Paul Atkins publicly responded to Commissioner Peirce’s statement, agreeing with her assessment of the situation. Atkins wrote, “Commissioner Peirce is right. With this chapter closed, we now have an opportunity to shift our energy from the courtroom to the policy drafting table. Our focus should be on building a clear regulatory framework that fosters innovation while protecting investors.” Commissioner Peirce is right. With this chapter closed, we now have an opportunity to shift our energy from the courtroom to the policy drafting table. Our focus should be on building a clear regulatory framework that fosters innovation while protecting investors. #ProjectCrypto — Paul Atkins (@SECPaulSAtkins) August 11, 2025 Atkins’s response reinforces the view that the conclusion of the Ripple case opens a window for constructive policy development. His reference to the “policy drafting table” suggests an intent to prioritize proactive regulatory design over continued legal confrontations. By stressing both innovation and investor protection, Atkins positioned the SEC’s next steps as a balance between supporting technological progress and safeguarding market integrity. Focus on Regulatory Framework Development Both statements reflect a shared recognition within the SEC that the cryptocurrency industry requires clearer rules and guidelines. While the details of how such a framework will be structured remain to be determined, the emphasis from both Peirce and Atkins indicates that the agency may devote more resources toward policy initiatives in the coming period. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Ripple case, which has been ongoing for years, has been a focal point in discussions about how securities laws apply to digital assets. With the matter now officially resolved, the SEC’s leadership appears aligned in using this moment to advance a more defined regulatory environment. This shift could involve public consultations, inter-agency collaboration, and dialogue with industry stakeholders to address compliance expectations and market oversight in a rapidly evolving sector. The public agreement between these two SEC officials highlights the possibility of a coordinated regulatory effort in the aftermath of one of the agency’s most high-profile crypto cases.

Key Takeaways: Short-term ETH holders are driving most profit-taking, realizing about $553M in gains daily. Overall profit-taking is still 39% below last month’s peak despite the recent rally. ETH trades near $4,283, with $2.23B in positions at risk if prices approach $4,700. Onchain data from Glassnode shows that traders who have held ETH for less than 155 days are realizing gains at a much faster pace than long-term investors, suggesting that some expect a near-term pullback. Glassnode said in an X post on Monday that profit realization, measured by a seven-day simple moving average, is currently around $553 million per day, with short-term holders driving most of the activity. ETH Profit-Taking Still 39% Below Last Month’s Peak Despite Uptick Long-term holders, by contrast, are cashing out at a pace similar to December 2024 levels. Despite the uptick, overall profit-taking remains 39% below the daily peak seen last month, when ETH traded near $3,500. Ether has climbed 43% over the past month and was trading at $4,283 at the time of writing. That leaves it about 12.7% shy of its November 2021 all-time high of $4,828. However, futures market data points to caution — CoinGlass estimates that roughly $2.23 billion in positions could be liquidated if ETH approaches $4,700. The current hesitation comes after several failed breakout attempts earlier this year. In March, ETH fell below $2,000, and subsequent rallies failed to sustain momentum, catching many traders off guard. This backdrop may explain why some market participants are quick to lock in gains. $ETH profit realization (7D SMA) peaked at $771M/day in July, above Dec ‘24 levels, and is now ramping up again at $553M/day. Profits from long-term holders match Dec ‘24 levels, but short-term investors are realizing far more gains, driving the current wave. pic.twitter.com/fsoBOrUTyF — glassnode (@glassnode) August 11, 2025 Not all traders are sitting out. Over the weekend, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes revealed he had bought back into Ethereum just a week after selling $10.5 million worth at $3,507. Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget, also claimed that Ethereum’s breakout above $4,300, coupled with gains in XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin, points to early signs of capital rotation away from Bitcoin. “BTC dominance has slipped from 62% to below 58% in recent weeks, and if altcoins maintain consistent outperformance, with the Altcoin Season Index showing 75% of top alts beating BTC over the past 90 days, it could mark the onset of a true altseason,” he said in a note shared with Cryptonews.com. According to Lee, in the short to medium term, Ethereum’s momentum looks bullish, poised to test $5,000 if it holds above $4,200, though a pullback to $3,600 remains possible if its overbought RSI (now 68.8) sparks profit-taking. Santiment’s Brian Quinlivan also noted that public announcements of large institutional purchases can sometimes trigger fear of missing out (FOMO), which paradoxically may stall or even reverse price gains in the near term. Ethereum Investors to Shift Back to Bitcoin as ETH Soars As reported, Bitcoin advocate Samson Mow has suggested that Ethereum’s latest rally could be setting up a reversal , with capital eventually flowing back into Bitcoin. Mow, CEO of Bitcoin adoption firm Jan3, claimed that many long-term ETH holders, particularly early insiders from the ICO era, already own significant amounts of Bitcoin. According to him, these investors are rotating BTC into ETH to “pump it on new narratives” such as the emergence of Ethereum treasury companies. Once prices rise sufficiently, he predicts they will sell their ETH, leaving “new generational bagholders,” and move the profits back into Bitcoin. “No one wants ETH in the long run,” he said.

Binance Research said in its monthly market insights report that balances held by companies climbed about 127% to more than 2.7m ETH ($11.6b). The rally was accompanied by an increase in the number of companies holding Ethereum on their books. Twenty-four new entities joined the ranks, bringing the total to 64. Together, these corporates now hold roughly 46.5% as much ETH as exchange-traded funds, which saw their own assets rise 39.5% to over 5.8m ETH, the report said. Corporate ETH Reserves Outpace Ethereum Foundation as Adoption Accelerates This surge reflects a shift toward direct Ethereum exposure, moving beyond passive ETF allocations. Some companies now hold more ETH than the Ethereum Foundation itself. Bitmine leads with 1.1m ETH, followed by Sharplink with 521,000 ETH. Additional disclosures are expected in the coming months, as more firms reveal similar strategies. The Ether Machine was a notable late-July entrant, reflecting the momentum in corporate ETH adoption. This buildup in holdings coincided with strong market performance. Ethereum rose more than 50% during the month, becoming one of the best-performing large-cap digital assets. The ETH-to-Bitcoin ratio hit a six-month high of 0.032, signaling renewed strength relative to Bitcoin as investors rotated capital. Ethereum’s Staking Yield and Deflationary Design Draw Corporate Buyers While corporate Bitcoin treasuries have been in the spotlight for a while, many of these new Ethereum strategies appear inspired by Michael Saylor’s playbook. However, they are also leveraging Ethereum’s unique attributes, such as staking rewards, a deflationary supply mechanism and its role as the primary collateral in decentralized finance. Regulatory tailwinds have added to the appeal. The US SEC’s implicit recognition of ETH as a commodity, combined with the passage of landmark stablecoin legislation, has boosted confidence in the asset’s long-term viability. July Brings Strongest Institutional Demand for ETH to Date The trend is unfolding against a backdrop of wider market gains. Binance Research reported that global cryptocurrency market capitalisation rose 13.3% in July 2025. The climb was driven by Bitcoin setting repeated all-time highs, surging institutional interest in Ethereum and major altcoins, record levels of corporate treasury adoption, and stronger regulatory clarity. Although Bitcoin remained a dominant force, July saw a clear rotation into altcoins, led by Ethereum. The asset drew inflows from both spot ETFs and corporate treasuries eager to capture additional staking yield, reinforcing its role in the evolving digital asset mix. Ethereum’s market share rose to 11.8%, while Bitcoin’s dominance slipped to about 60%. The month also marked a record 19 consecutive days of positive net inflows into Ethereum spot ETFs, underscoring sustained investor demand. The outlook for corporate Ethereum adoption remains promising, though the market is still maturing. Higher volatility compared with Bitcoin could test the durability of these treasury strategies, but for now, Ethereum’s appeal among institutional and corporate buyers appears to be growing at its fastest pace yet.

While big moves like this grab headlines, seasoned traders often seek undervalued projects with strong fundamentals and real utility for long-term gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) fits that bill perfectly. With a unique decentralized lending model and a token currently priced attractively in its Phase 6 presale at $0.035, MUTM presents an exciting alternative to high-profile tokens like XRP. Ripple (XRP) soars 16.5% Ripple’s XRP surged 16.5% to ~$3.27, driven by the SEC’s approval of XRP-linked ETFs from ProShares and Grayscale recently, per CoinJournal. The rally, with trading volume exploding to over $11.74 billion, reflects strong institutional and retail demand, with 182 million tokens traded in 24 hours. The legal clarity from Ripple’s SEC case resolution, finalized August 8, 2025, with a $50 million fine, boosted ETF approval odds to 95%, per Bloomberg analysts. Technical indicators show XRP breaking $3.20 resistance, with RSI at 65 and support at $3.00. Posts on X note whale accumulation of $1 billion off-exchange, signaling bullish sentiment. Analysts project a $6.50 target if $3.64 clears, but macro pressures like U.S. tariffs could trigger a pullback to $2.80. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s dual lending models capture diverse market needs Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending model offers a solid income stream for investors wanting predictable returns. For example, lending $15,000 worth of Cardano (ADA) at a 9.3% annual percentage yield (APY) yields $1,395 each year. This steady income is secured by overcollateralized loans, where borrowers put up more assets than the loan value, providing safety for lenders. This mechanism appeals to more conservative users looking for consistent returns without excessive risk. On the other hand, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending framework caters to borrowers and lenders comfortable with higher risk and reward. Imagine a borrower pledging $12,000 in TRUMP tokens as collateral at a 60% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. This borrower would receive a $7,200 USDC loan with a 12% interest rate over a 120-day term. This approach allows users to leverage volatile memecoins while offering lenders attractive yields. This flexibility positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a platform that appeals to a broad audience, from cautious lenders to speculative borrowers. The presale status of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) highlights strong market demand. Currently in Phase 6 at $0.035 per token, the project has raised $14.3 million and attracted more than 15,100 holders, with 15% of the total token supply already sold. Security is a major focus, demonstrated by excellent CertiK audit scores: a Token Scan rating of 95 and a Skynet rating of 78, assuring investors of the platform’s robustness. The $50,000 Bug Bounty program incentivizes ongoing security improvements, while a $100,000 giveaway fuels community engagement and excitement. Early investors are seeing remarkable growth. A Phase 1 participant who invested $8,000 worth of Bitcoin to purchase MUTM tokens at $0.01 now holds $28,000 at the current Phase 6 price point, reflecting a 250% return on investment. Upon the anticipated listing at $0.06, that same stake will be valued at $48,000. Analysts project that following the beta launch and exchange listings, the token’s value is set to triple again, underlining the impressive upside for early adopters. Strong foundations for future expansion and price growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s roadmap is well poised to support sustained growth through several powerful drivers. The upcoming integration of a decentralized stablecoin will significantly increase borrowing demand on the platform. This stablecoin will be minted only against approved collateral and burned when loans are repaid, maintaining a balanced ecosystem that encourages liquidity and usage. In addition, listings on multiple exchanges will expose Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to a global investor base, vastly increasing token accessibility and trading volume. This exposure is expected to draw a broader audience into the MUTM ecosystem, fueling demand and price appreciation. Moreover, the protocol plans to utilize revenue generated from its operations to buy back MUTM tokens from the market, which will then be distributed as staking rewards to mtToken stakers. This buyback mechanism creates a reinforcing cycle where platform growth supports token demand, incentivizing users to stake and hold MUTM, thereby tightening token circulation and boosting price stability. With only 15% of Phase 6 tokens sold so far, investors have a prime opportunity to acquire MUTM before the price rises to $0.040 in the next presale phase. This 15% increase is expected to occur before the wider market fully embraces the upcoming bull run, making early entry a strategic move to maximize returns. In conclusion, while Ripple’s ETF-driven price rally attracts attention, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building to offer a compelling, utility-rich alternative with a much lower entry point. Its dual lending models will serve both cautious and aggressive market participants, backed by strong security audits and a vibrant community. With stablecoin integration, exchange listings, and a revenue-funded buyback program on the horizon, MUTM is set for a substantial price appreciation.

At this point, the SEC officially ended its case against Ripple last week. While this was received positively in the market, SEC member Hester Peirce, known for her moderate approach to cryptocurrencies, shared a post about the closure of the case. Peirce, who described the end of the case as a welcome development, stated that with the closure of Ripple and other cases, minds that were once preoccupied with lawsuits can now focus on creating a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins, responding to Peirce's comment, stated that he agreed with Peirce and said the outcome of the case should be seen as a turning point. Atkins said the agency will now focus on drafting a clear cryptocurrency regulatory framework that supports innovation and investor protection. “SEC member Peirce is right. Now that the SEC vs. Ripple case has concluded, we have the opportunity to shift our energy from the courtroom to the policymaking table. “The resolution of the case could also be a chance to establish a clear regulatory framework that encourages innovation and protects investors.” In the case, which began in late 2020, the SEC accused Ripple of selling XRP as an unregistered security. Commissioner Peirce is right. With this chapter closed, we now have an opportunity to shift our energy from the courtroom to the policy drafting table. Our focus should be on building a clear regulatory framework that fosters innovation while protecting investors. #ProjectCrypto — Paul Atkins (@SECPaulSAtkins) August 11, 2025 *This is not investment advice.

The surge wiped out hundreds of millions in leveraged trades, with $207 million in short positions liquidated in just one day. DOGE fans and even Trump-aligned traders are celebrating the momentum, while attention is shifting toward a fresh player making early investors big gains. That player is MAGACOIN FINANCE — a name increasingly linked to high-growth potential in this cycle. From SHIB to DOGE, meme coins have produced wild returns in the past, but some traders believe MAGACOIN’s setup could push it into the ranks of the best altcoin to buy now for 2025. ETH Smashes Through $4.2K, Leaving $200M in Liquidations Behind Between August 8 and 9, 2025, Ethereum ripped from around $3,900 to $4,200 in under 48 hours. This rapid rise triggered one of the largest liquidation waves of the year. According to crypto liquidation news 2025 data, $238 million in leveraged positions were wiped out across major exchanges. The majority were shorts betting against ETH. The rest came from over-leveraged longs that got caught chasing the spike. Source: Coinglass For traders watching the Ethereum price prediction, this rally has reignited talk of ETH testing $4,500 before year-end. The breakout has also given new life to related assets, with DOGE catching renewed interest. While the DOGE price forecast remains volatile, social media activity shows that meme coin traders are enjoying the bullish spillover from ETH’s push. Can ETH’s Rally Fuel the Next Altcoin Surge? When Ethereum hits $4,200, it doesn’t just move ETH holders — it often lifts the wider altcoin market. History shows that strong ETH rallies tend to bring fresh liquidity into speculative plays, including meme coins and early-stage tokens. DOGE’s rebound has been the most visible side effect so far, but the present climate is also creating room for newer entrants like MAGACOIN. The combination of high-profile liquidations, renewed retail energy, and the hunt for outsized returns could set the stage for another multi-month rally across altcoins. For those tracking the Ethereum price prediction, it’s worth watching if ETH can hold above $4,000. Sustained strength here could create more upside for DOGE, MAGACOIN, and other high-growth plays heading into 2025. From SHIB to MAGACOIN FINANCE — Investors Targeting 14,700% Profits This Cycle Amid the action in Ethereum and DOGE, there’s growing chatter about a newcomer: MAGACOIN FINANCE. Analysts tracking early-stage tokens have flagged MAGACOIN as one of the best crypto to buy 2025 for those looking beyond the obvious blue-chip picks. Backers claim the project is modeled to ride the kind of explosive wave seen with SHIB in 2021, with ambitious targets pointing toward potential 14,700% returns in the present cycle. The difference? Supporters see MAGACOIN as a more strategically positioned play, aiming to combine meme-driven community growth with a longer-term vision. For investors searching for the best altcoin to buy now, its presale structure and early traction have pushed it into watchlists alongside bigger names. In a market where a new crypto with 500% gains in its early days can quickly become the next breakout story, MAGACOIN’s momentum is making it a talking point for traders aiming to diversify their holdings. What This Week’s Moves Tell Us This week’s story is more than just Ethereum’s breakout. It’s about a market willing to punish overconfident shorts, reward trend-followers, and chase fresh narratives. ETH’s rally, DOGE’s renewed hype, and the rise of a new crypto with 500% gains all point to an environment ready for risk. MAGACOIN FINANCE might still be in its early stages, but if its trajectory keeps pace with projections, it could sit alongside the biggest names when traders look back at 2025’s winners. For now, it’s one of the best altcoin to buy now for those willing to position before the next wave hits.

This latest transaction brings the company’s total holdings to 18,113 BTC. Details Of The New Transaction Metaplanet’s CEO, Simon Gerovich, shared the news in an August 12 X post, revealing that the latest buy was made at an average price of $118,519 per coin. As of August 12, the company’s reserves amounted to 18,113 BTC, acquired for $1.85 billion at an average price of $101,911 per coin. The outfit tracks a unique performance metric called BTC Yield, which measures Bitcoin holdings relative to fully diluted shares. From July 1 to August 12, it has achieved a Bitcoin yield of 26.5%. This has increased its year-to-date performance to 468.1%. Since adopting the leading cryptocurrency as a Treasury reserve asset in 2024, Metaplanet has aggressively expanded both its holdings and ambitions. In July alone, it acquired a total of 4245 BTC across four major transactions. The first took place on July 7, when the company purchased 2,205 BTC for approximately $238.7 million, followed by a 797 BTC buy on July 14 worth $93.6 million. Two weeks later, it added another 780 BTC for $92.5 million, capping it with a final acquisition of 463 BTC valued at $54 million. The firm’s goal is to accumulate 210,000 BTC, roughly 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply, by the end of 2027 under its “555 Million Plan.” Following the latest development, it still ranks 6th globally among corporate Bitcoin holders, trailing only giants like Strategy, MARA, XXI, Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company, and Riot. Elsewhere, Strategy also revealed a modest purchase of 155 BTC for $18 million that brought its total reserves to $46.09 billion. Market Reaction According to Google Finance data , the Japanese Bitcoin Treasury’s stock has dipped by 2.1%. The stock has also fallen 37% over the past month but remains up 173% year-to-date. To fund its aggressive accumulation, Metaplanet has adopted various unconventional financing tools designed to preserve shareholder equity while securing long-term capital. These include zero-interest convertible bonds, moving-strike warrants, and perpetual preferred stock issuances. The latest buy followed an August 1 filing for a shelf registration to raise up to $3.74 billion through perpetual preferred shares. The outfit also said it plans to increase its authorized share count to 2.72 billion and introduce two classes of perpetual preferred shares. According to CEO Gerovich, the structure is meant to align financing flexibility with investor preferences while maintaining high per-share Bitcoin exposure.

The bitcoin (BTC) rally has stalled, raising the possibility of a potentially bearish technical formation: a double top. A close examination of the daily chart reveals that bulls failed to sustain a rally above the key Fibonacci level of $122,056 on Monday, a performance that precisely mirrors a similar rejection on July 14, according to data source TradingView. This dual failure to establish a foothold above the key price point, separated by a brief pullback, is a hallmark of the double top pattern. The neckline of this pattern, drawn from the low of $111,982 reached during the brief pullback, is the key level to watch on the downside. A decisive move below that level would confirm the double top breakdown, potentially opening the door for a sell-off to $100,000. That level is arrived at by subtracting the gap between the twin peaks and the neckline from the neckline level in what's known as the measured move method of calculating targets. Early this year, BTC double-topped near $100,000, eventually falling to lows under $75,000 in early April. The double top comprises two peaks separated by a trough and takes roughly two to six weeks to form. The gap between the two peaks must be equal to or less than 5%, with the spread between peaks and the trough being at least 10%, according to technical analysis theory. These, however, are guidelines and not rules, meaning the backdrop is more important – the pattern should appear after a prolonged uptrend to be valid, which is the case with BTC. Resistance: $120,000, $122,056, $123,181. Support: $114,295 (the 50-day SMA), $111,982, $100,000. Bears gain an upper hand ahead of U.S. CPI The dual failure of Bitcoin bulls to sustain gains above $122,000 indicates a clear case of buyer exhaustion, giving bears a significant upper hand as the market heads into today's CPI release. This exhaustion of buying pressure means the market is now particularly vulnerable to a hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation report due Tuesday. In other words, the buying momentum is not strong enough to absorb the potential selling pressure triggered by an elevated CPI and the resulting drop in the Fed rate cut bets. In this scenario, the market could experience a rapid decline.

The innovative platform’s combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models will offer scalable and versatile financial solutions that are set to drive rapid user growth once the beta launch rolls out. This makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) an exciting prospect in today’s competitive crypto market. Solana (SOL) hits $181.57 on transaction surge Solana (SOL) surged 12.6% over the past week, reaching ~$181.57, driven by a transaction volume spike to 5.9 million daily transactions, per Solscan data. The rally, with a 24-hour trading volume of $4.97 billion, follows a 14% increase in DeFi TVL to $14 billion, fueled by protocols like Raydium and Jupiter, per DefiLlama. Technical indicators show SOL breaking $180 resistance, with RSI at 66.96 and support at $170.07, per Cryptopolitan. Posts on X highlight whale accumulation of $200 million in SOL and Binance’s desktop wallet launch supporting Solana (SOL). Analysts project a $211 target if $188.69 clears, but macro pressures like US tariffs and a 17% drop in memecoin activity pose risks. A drop below $170 could test $158.56. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): scalable lending models positioned for mass adoption Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out by offering two distinct lending approaches that cater to diverse investor appetites. The P2C model leverages pooled smart contracts, allowing users to lend blue-chip crypto assets securely and earn interest via mtTokens, which also serve as collateral for loans. This structure balances safety and yield, making it attractive to more conservative investors looking for dependable returns. On the other hand, the P2P lending feature empowers users to negotiate personalized loan terms for riskier, high-volatility tokens such as memecoins, including FLOKI, BONK, TRUMP and DOGE. This dynamic framework opens up high-reward opportunities for users willing to engage in direct lending agreements. Together, these dual systems enable Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to capture a broader market segment than many other DeFi platforms, providing scalable solutions that meet evolving financial needs. With the beta launch on the horizon, users will experience these lending mechanisms firsthand on a Layer-2 blockchain network. This upgrade will deliver enhanced speed and lower transaction costs, two critical factors that have held back DeFi adoption. The introduction of a decentralized stablecoin will further enrich the ecosystem by offering liquidity and stability for borrowers and lenders alike. Investor enthusiasm is already reflected in Phase 6 of the presale, where $14.3 million has been raised and 15% of tokens have been sold at a price of $0.035. With over 15,100 holders actively engaged, the community is gearing up for the next phase, where prices will increase by 15% to $0.040. This momentum signals a growing recognition of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s potential. Proven early returns and future growth drivers Early investors in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) have witnessed impressive gains. An initial $100,000 investment during Phase 1 at the $0.01 price point is now worth approximately $350,000 at current Phase 6 pricing. Looking forward, should the token reach a conservative post-listing price of $0.60—a figure well below some analyst predictions—this same investment would multiply to around $6 million. Such returns clearly demonstrate the advantages of entering the market early with a project rooted in strong fundamentals. Security and transparency are paramount for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The platform has undergone a rigorous CertiK audit, earning a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet rating of 78. These independent evaluations validate the quality and safety of the project’s smart contracts and code, providing confidence to investors wary of risks in the DeFi space. Additionally, the project has cultivated a loyal and active community of over 12,000 followers on Twitter, further showcasing its growing influence. Several key developments are set to drive demand for MUTM tokens in the near future. The platform plans to initiate open-market buybacks using generated protocol revenue, rewarding users who stake their mtTokens. This strategy creates a sustainable mechanism to support token price appreciation. Moreover, confirmed listings on leading centralized exchanges will provide greater liquidity and accessibility, attracting a wider investor base. The upcoming Layer-2 integration will address common issues such as high gas fees and slow transactions, making the platform more user-friendly and competitive. Meanwhile, the launch of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s own stablecoin will add an essential layer of stability and functionality, empowering users to borrow and lend with a reliable medium of exchange. As Phase 6 of the presale nears completion, tokens priced at $0.035 are rapidly selling out, and the price is slated to increase by 15% to $0.040 in Phase 7. This creates a strong incentive for investors to act decisively and secure their positions before the opportunity narrows. In a market where scalable, secure, and versatile DeFi solutions are in high demand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as a standout contender with a clear path to substantial growth. With innovative lending models, robust security, and a strategic roadmap that includes a beta launch, Layer-2 enhancements, and exchange listings, the project is building to offer a compelling case for investors seeking significant upside. As Solana (SOL)’s rise captures headlines, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) quietly builds momentum for a 2500% return that is impossible to ignore.

Bitcoin’s robust performance not only solidifies its status as digital gold but also significantly boosts miners’ profit expectations worldwide. However, traditional mining remains inaccessible for most individual investors due to high hardware costs, complex technical requirements, energy price volatility, and rapid equipment iteration. Cryptosolo , a cloud mining platform based in London’s financial district, has responded to this trend by launching an upgraded “Cloud Mining + Liquidity Mining” dual-track model. This innovative approach allows users across the globe to easily and efficiently participate in the Bitcoin ecosystem, capturing the historic opportunities presented by the current digital asset boom—regardless of their experience level. Industry Trend: Hashrate Financialization Becomes the New Frontier The security and block generation of the Bitcoin network rely on globally distributed computing power. As mining competition intensifies, cloud mining has emerged as a new paradigm, financializing and securitizing hashrate to lower entry barriers. Users simply rent computing power from a compliant platform, while the provider handles all hardware procurement, deployment, and maintenance. Investors receive daily BTC rewards proportional to their hashrate share. 1. Four Key Advantages of Cryptosolo: Fully Managed, Zero Technical Barriers Cryptosolo takes care of all hardware procurement, global deployment (including green energy hubs in Iceland and Norway), and provides 24/7 technical support. Users are free from concerns about equipment depreciation and electricity price fluctuations. 2. Efficient and Stable Hashrate Output The platform utilizes Bitmain’s latest ETC E11 miners (9500MH/s efficiency), hosted in Nordic data centers with stable power and temperature control, ensuring consistent performance. 3. Flexible Contracts, Low Entry Threshold Short-term contracts from 1 to 6 days are available, starting from as little as $15. New users receive a $15 bonus upon registration, making it easy to start mining immediately. [For more contract details, please click here] 4. Transparent Data, Secure Funds Users can monitor real-time hashrate performance, daily earnings (settled at 00:00 London time), and withdrawable balances via the dashboard. All data is verifiable on-chain. The platform supports deposits and withdrawals in major cryptocurrencies, ensuring secure and convenient fund management. Market Response and Future Outlook With Bitcoin’s price soaring and North American spot ETFs seeing over $1. 5 billion in weekly net inflows, the market is hotter than ever. Eleanor Whitaker, Chief Strategy Officer at Cryptosolo, stated: “The influx of institutional capital is accelerating Bitcoin’s assetization, but individual investors don’t need to face the risks of physical mining. Cloud mining transforms hashrate into a configurable financial asset. We’re working with the London Clearing House to develop hashrate derivatives, expected to launch in Q1 2026, providing users with more risk-hedging options.” Cryptosolo’s official website (https://cryptosolo.com) is now open for registration. New users can claim a $15 bonus to experience mining immediately. As of press time, the number of UK users on the platform has increased by 217% month-on-month, highlighting the growing appeal of compliant cloud mining solutions among investors.

Bitcoin has dropped below $119K while Ether maintains its price above $4,200. The bearish performance comes ahead of this week’s crucial inflation data. XRP has held its price at a crucial support region, which could serve as a springboard for a possible breakout. XRP holds price above $3 XRP is currently trading at $3.15 after losing 3.6% of its value in the last 24 hours. The bearish performance is evident in the negative futures Open Interest (OI) data during that period. Data obtained from CoinGlass revealed that XRP’s OI averaged $7.9 billion, down 9% from the $8.5 billion recorded over the weekend. A subsequent decrease in the futures weighted funding rates to $0.0084% from 0.0108% over the last 24 hours suggests that more traders are leveraging short positions in XRP. The decrease in trading volume to $7.9 billion as OI and funding rates dip points to shrinking market activity. Despite the profit taking, XRP has held its price above the $3 support level. Traders are focusing their attention on the US inflation data coming up later today. In an email with Invezz, XBTO’s Chief Investment Officer, Javier Rodriguez-Alarcón – formerly of BlackRock and JPMorgan – stated that the CPI and PPI data this week would be crucial in the market performance. He added that, The week ahead brings two key US inflation developments: the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Tuesday, which measures household price changes, and the Producer Price Index (PPI) on Thursday, which tracks wholesale price changes for businesses. These reports are key in shaping expectations for Federal Reserve policy. Recent market data now shows that traders are pricing in approximately an 89% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve at the upcoming September FOMC meeting. If inflation comes in higher than expected, investor appetite for risk could weaken and the rally could stall. XRP targets $3.66 high if support holds The XRP/USD 4-hour chart remains bullish despite the coin losing nearly 4% of its value in the last 24 hours. The $3 support has so far held and could serve as the springboard for XRP to rally higher in the near term. The RSI of 50 suggests that the market is currently neutral while the MACD lines remain within the positive territory. If the $3 support holds, XRP could experience a breakout soon that could see its price break above the recent high of $3.66. An extended bullish run would enable XRP to set a new all-time high above $4. However, if the $3 support fails to hold, XRP could retest the $2.39 support before falling below $2 on heavy selling pressure. The $3 and $2.39 support levels could absorb the selling pressure and prevent XRP from recording huge losses.

The big inflow day adds to a five consecutive trading day inflow streak totalling $1.8 billion. Ether ETFs have now seen a total aggregate inflow of $10.8 billion, and the lion’s share of that has come within the last month or so. In addition to the overall inflow record, there were new daily inflow records for BlackRock and Fidelity funds, observed industry expert Nate Geraci. We have a *new* daily record inflow for spot eth ETFs… *$1bil* in new $$$. First daily inflow over $1bil mark. New daily record for both iShares & Fidelity eth ETFs as well. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) August 12, 2025 BlackRock Leads The Way BlackRock’s ETHA fund saw a record day with a whopping $640 million inflow as it scooped up more than 150,000 ETH. The fund has now seen more than $10 billion in total inflows, most of which have come over the past month, according to CoinGlass. Fidelity’s FETH fund saw a record $277 million inflow, with the product taking in over 65,000 ETH on Monday. Even Grayscale’s mini Ethereum trust saw an inflow of $66 million for the day. “It feels like spot ETH ETFs were severely underestimated simply because TradFi investors didn’t understand Ethereum,” commented Geraci. Bitcoin had a “nice clean narrative,” as digital gold, but Ether took more time for investors to understand, he said before adding: “Now they’re hearing ‘backbone of future financial markets’ and it’s resonating.” The massive ETF inflow came on the same day that Tom Lee’s Ethereum treasury firm Bitmine announced reaching a milestone of accumulating 1 million ETH. It also coincided with a surge to an almost four-year high as ETH prices tapped $4,350 on Monday. Bitcoin ETFs Cooling Bitcoin spot ETFs are not getting the same love at the moment, with an aggregate inflow of just $178 million on Monday, less than Fidelity’s Ether fund. BlackRock’s IBIT fund accounted for most of this with $138 million in inflows. Bitcoin funds have seen a four-day consecutive trading inflow streak totalling $950 million as the asset reclaimed $122,000 on Monday. Nevertheless, BTC has since retreated back to $118,600, which could turn today into an outflow day for spot ETFs.

On August 12, 2024, at 08:00 UTC, Upbit will add the highly anticipated CYBER/KRW and CYBER/USDT spot trading pairs. This Upbit CYBER listing marks a significant milestone for the Cyber Network’s native token, CYBER, opening new avenues for liquidity and accessibility. What’s the Buzz About the Upbit CYBER Listing? This development is a big deal for several reasons. Upbit stands as one of the largest and most influential cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, boasting substantial trading volumes and a vast user base. A listing on such a prominent platform typically brings increased visibility and legitimacy to a digital asset. For CYBER, the native token of the Cyber Network, this means a significant boost in exposure. The Cyber Network is an innovative Ethereum layer-2 solution, designed to enhance scalability and efficiency for decentralized applications. Key benefits of this listing include: Enhanced Liquidity: Adding KRW (Korean Won) and USDT (Tether) pairs significantly increases the pool of available funds for trading CYBER. Broader Accessibility: Traders in South Korea and international users will find it easier to buy and sell CYBER. Increased Adoption: Greater availability often leads to more users interacting with the Cyber Network. Potential Price Impact: New listings on major exchanges can often lead to positive price movements due to increased demand. Understanding CYBER: The Cyber Network Token So, what exactly is CYBER, and why is the Cyber Network important? CYBER serves as the utility token for the Cyber Network, which aims to address some of the persistent challenges faced by the Ethereum blockchain, primarily related to transaction speeds and high gas fees. An Ethereum layer-2 solution, like the Cyber Network, operates on top of the main Ethereum blockchain. It processes transactions off-chain, then bundles them together and submits them back to the main chain. This method dramatically reduces congestion and costs, making dApps more usable for everyday activities. The CYBER token plays a crucial role within this ecosystem. It is often used for: Network Fees: Paying for transactions on the Cyber Network. Governance: Allowing token holders to participate in decisions about the network’s future. Staking: Securing the network and earning rewards. The listing of CYBER trading pairs on Upbit highlights the growing recognition of layer-2 solutions and their importance in the broader crypto landscape. What Does This Mean for New CYBER Spot Pairs? The introduction of CYBER spot pairs (CYBER/KRW and CYBER/USDT) provides direct access for traders. KRW is the official currency of South Korea, meaning local investors can directly trade CYBER without needing an intermediate stablecoin. This streamlines the process and reduces potential conversion fees. The CYBER/USDT pair is equally vital. USDT is the most widely used stablecoin in the crypto world, pegged to the US dollar. Its inclusion ensures global accessibility, allowing international traders to easily participate in the Upbit CYBER listing . This broadens the market significantly, fostering a more robust trading environment. The immediate availability of these pairs on August 12, 08:00 UTC, means traders can prepare now for the launch. Navigating the Upbit Crypto Exchange and New Listings When a major platform like Upbit announces a new listing, it often generates considerable excitement. However, it is crucial for investors to approach such events with a well-informed strategy. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before trading, thoroughly understand the Cyber Network, its technology, and the use cases of the CYBER token. Understand Volatility: New listings can experience significant price volatility in the initial hours or days. Be prepared for rapid price swings. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders to manage potential downsides. Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from Upbit and the Cyber Network for any updates or further details. The Upbit crypto exchange is a regulated platform, but the inherent risks of cryptocurrency trading remain. Always prioritize your financial well-being. The Upbit CYBER listing of CYBER/KRW and CYBER/USDT spot pairs on August 12 is a monumental event for the Cyber Network. This move by a top-tier exchange like Upbit promises enhanced liquidity, broader accessibility, and increased adoption for the CYBER token. As the crypto market continues to evolve, such listings play a crucial role in bringing innovative projects like Cyber Network to a wider audience. Traders and enthusiasts alike should view this development as a significant step forward for the Layer-2 ecosystem, while always prioritizing informed decision-making.

Breaking above the $4,000 mark has not only lit a fire under ETH itself but also sparked strong moves in Avalanche (AVAX) and Chainlink (LINK). Both tokens have seen renewed buying interest over the past week, and alongside them, one mid-cap altcoin — MAGACOIN FINANCE — is quietly emerging as a favored pick for traders looking to capture early-stage upside before the next wave of market momentum. Why Ethereum’s Rally Is Pulling AVAX and LINK Higher Avalanche has been grinding its way back into bullish territory. Trading just above $24, AVAX has gained nearly 4% on the day after bouncing from strong technical support at $21.50. Confidence in the network is building thanks to major institutional investments — BlackRock’s $240 million and VanEck’s $100 million into Avalanche-powered real-world asset projects have provided a major credibility boost. The recent “Octane” upgrade has cut fees by 42% and improved network speeds, making the platform even more attractive for DeFi, gaming, and payments use cases. Chainlink has been equally impressive. LINK’s breakout past $21 was backed by heavy volume after the launch of the “Chainlink Reserve,” a new on-chain strategic reserve already holding millions in LINK. The initiative aims to strengthen network sustainability and long-term value. With big names like Mastercard and JPMorgan integrating Chainlink infrastructure, whale accumulation has surged, pushing open interest and daily transaction activity sharply higher. Analysts Bullish On MAGACOIN FINANCE While AVAX and LINK have been standout performers, some traders are reallocating a portion of their gains into high-upside mid-caps. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one such project seeing a spike in activity. Built around a politically charged meme narrative and supported by a growing community, the token is currently in a phase of rapid presale adoption. Analysts tracking wallet activity have noted large transactions from established AVAX and LINK holders flowing into MAGACOIN FINANCE . The rationale is straightforward: in bull markets, early-stage projects with strong branding, cultural relevance, and secure infrastructure can deliver some of the largest percentage gains. Conclusion The ETH-led rally has created a wave of optimism that’s spilling over into the rest of the market. Avalanche and Chainlink are clear beneficiaries, but history suggests that the next cycle’s breakout stars often start off quietly. MAGACOIN FINANCE fits that description today — attracting attention from seasoned traders who see potential in its unique positioning and early traction. If momentum continues to build, it could emerge as one of Q4’s biggest winners.

49963348,553618,1754985603,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49963348.jpeg,Strategy Continues Bitcoin Buying Spree—Scoops Up Another 155 BTC,https://bitcoinist.com/strategy-bitcoin-buying-spree-scoops-up-155-btc/,"Michael Saylor’s Strategy has announced a fresh expansion of its Bitcoin treasury, with another 155 BTC being added to its holdings. Strategy Has Completed Another Bitcoin Acquisition In a new post on X, Strategy co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor has revealed the latest purchase completed by the company. The buy, involving a sum of 155 BTC, has come after a break from accumulation last week. Like is usually the case, Saylor hinted at the acquisition a day in advance, writing on X on Sunday: “if you don’t stop buying Bitcoin, you won’t stop making Money.” According to the filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) , Strategy bought the coins in the week between August 4th and 10th at an average price of $116,401. This means that the 155 tokens cost the firm around $18 million. This is a relatively modest purchase for the company. As the chart shared by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn shows, the buy is much smaller than the last few acquisitions. The previous buy, made toward the end of last month, was especially larger. It involved a massive 21,021 BTC and was the largest purchase by the company in eight months. After the latest acquisition, Strategy owns 628,946 BTC, purchased for $46.09 billion. At the current exchange rate, this stack is worth $75.17 billion, meaning that the firm is sitting on a profit of about 63%. There are currently over 19.9 million tokens of the cryptocurrency in circulation, implying that the company’s holdings alone account for around 3.16% of the total supply. In an X post , institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) has shared a chart for the top 10 companies and governments ranked up based on their Bitcoin holdings. As is apparent from the above graph, Strategy far outweighs all governments and companies in terms of Bitcoin holdings, with the closest competitor being the US. In another post , Sentora has shared another insight related to BTC treasuries, this one focused on the growth that they have seen since the start of 2024. “The amount of Bitcoin held in treasuries has been increasing steadily in recent years, from a combined amount of 1.2 million Bitcoin in 2024 to over 1.86 million bitcoin in August of 2025,” notes the analytics firm. Strategy alone makes up for a third of this amount.

Whale Alert, a renowned blockchain tracker, reported a substantial movement of 2,155 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $257 million, from the Binance exchange to Ceffu. This considerable BTC transfer highlights ongoing institutional activity and robust security practices within the digital asset space. Unlocking Secure Digital Asset Security: What is Ceffu? Ceffu operates as an institutional-grade custody solution, strategically backed by Binance. It provides secure, compliant, and scalable infrastructure for managing large digital asset holdings. Think of it as a highly fortified vault designed specifically for cryptocurrencies. This platform offers advanced security features, including multi-party computation (MPC) technology and segregated cold storage solutions. These measures significantly reduce risks associated with hacking or unauthorized access, ensuring top-tier digital asset security for its clients. Why Does a Large Bitcoin Transfer to Ceffu Matter? When a platform like Binance executes a large Bitcoin transfer to a custody provider like Ceffu, it often signals internal asset management or enhanced security protocols. Such movements are a common practice for major exchanges aiming to bolster their reserves’ safety and manage liquidity efficiently. It typically does not indicate a sale or an impending market dump. Instead, it demonstrates a commitment to robust operational security and compliance, especially for significant holdings. This proactive approach helps maintain trust and stability in the crypto ecosystem. Decoding the Impact of Crypto Whale Movement A ‘crypto whale’ refers to an individual or entity holding a substantial amount of cryptocurrency. Their movements are closely monitored because they can sometimes precede significant market shifts. However, not all crypto whale movement signals a market sell-off. Many large transfers, like the one from Binance to Ceffu, are for internal rebalancing, moving funds to more secure cold storage, or preparing for institutional services. Blockchain transparency allows us to track these movements, providing valuable insights into market dynamics without necessarily indicating negative intent. The Binance Ceffu Transaction: A Testament to Trust and Compliance This particular Binance Ceffu transaction underscores the growing demand for institutional-grade solutions in the crypto industry. As more large-scale investors and institutions enter the space, the need for secure, compliant, and audited custody services becomes paramount. Ceffu fills this crucial role. The move also reflects Binance’s dedication to maintaining a high standard of security for its vast user base and institutional partners. It reinforces confidence in the exchange’s ability to safeguard substantial digital assets, aligning with evolving regulatory expectations and best practices. In conclusion, the recent BTC transfer of 2,155 Bitcoin from Binance to Ceffu is a clear indicator of mature asset management and heightened security measures within the cryptocurrency landscape. It exemplifies the industry’s continuous efforts to provide robust and reliable infrastructure for large-scale digital asset holdings. This move is a testament to the ongoing professionalization and institutional adoption shaping the future of crypto.

The integration is live and applies to upcoming commercial flights, adding crypto rails alongside traditional methods for one of the world’s best-known suborbital tourism offerings. Jeff Bezos Opens Blue Origin To Bitcoin, ETH, SOL Payments According to the joint release, customers “starting today” can pay for Blue Origin’s suborbital flights in BTC, ETH, SOL, USDT and USDC. Shift4 says the flow also supports direct connections to widely used self-custody and exchange wallets — “popular wallets like Coinbase and MetaMask” — enabling instant authorization and settlement on chain before conversion to US dollars on the merchant side. Shift4 framed the move as part of a broader push to reduce friction in high-value commerce. “Our mission has always been to revolutionize commerce by simplifying the transaction process,” CEO Taylor Lauber said, adding that the company is “thrilled to now extend that vision beyond Earth” and to offer a “simple, frictionless experience” for Blue Origin customers opting to pay in digital assets.

Inside Shift4, the initiative is being led by the firm’s dedicated crypto unit. “Crypto is now a $4 trillion asset class,” said Alex Wilson, Shift4’s Head of Crypto, arguing that digital assets will become “an increasingly popular way for consumers to pay, particularly for high-end purchases,” where both buyer and seller can save on fees and delays relative to more complex cross-border card payments.

The company notes that “more than 75 humans” have already flown aboard New Shepard and highlights the vehicle’s panoramic crew-capsule windows, among the largest yet flown, for views of Earth during several minutes of microgravity. The companies did not disclose seat pricing or specific processing fees for Bitcoin and crypto transactions in today’s materials. It is also unclear if Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin converts the Bitcoin and crypto payments into US dollars. What is clear is the operational stance: Shift4 says crypto and stablecoin payments are available “immediately” for Blue Origin bookings, and directs prospective passengers to the program’s information page, which invites would-be travelers to become “one of the first 1000 people to fly to space.” Notably, Blue Origin has already flown one high-profile industry figure: TRON founder Justin Sun. He rode on August 3, 2025, as part of mission NS-34 alongside five other passengers, after first winning Blue Origin’s inaugural seat auction in 2021—a $28 million bid whose proceeds were distributed to 19 space-focused nonprofits through the company’s Club for the Future.

The benchmark lending rates are now at 3.6%, the lowest since April 2023, which aligned with analysts’ expectations. The Reserve Bank of Australia acknowledged that the cut was due to a downgrade in the annual economic outlook for the country. It also expects a lower economic growth for the year at 1.7% from its previous estimate of 2.1%. Australia expects more rate cuts in 2025 The RBA has just cut interest rates for the third time in six months. Today’s quarter of a percentage point cut brings the cash rate to 3.60 per cent and will make a meaningful difference to millions of mortgage holders around the country. Under @AustralianLabor , inflation is… — Jim Chalmers MP (@JEChalmers) August 12, 2025 The country recorded 2.1% inflation in the second quarter, which lies closer to the RBA’s 2%-3% range. Economists and financial markets also widely anticipated Tuesday’s cut after the June quarter CPI showed moderation in inflation. Reserve Bank governor Michele Bullock said she was waiting for the June quarter inflation data in July before delivering any easing. The data released in July showed underlying inflation moderated to a 3.5-year low of 2.7% in June, giving a near-certain signal for an interest rate cut on Tuesday. The financial institution noted that inflation had plummeted since the peak in 2022. The RBA board also plans to be attentive to the data and the evolving assessment of risk to guide its decisions. The RBA said it doesn’t see another weaker-than-expected rise in public demand evident in early 2025 through the rest of the year. Economists forecast that Australia will cut interest rates another 25 basis points to 3.35% by December, but expect it to slow after that. The financial institution had also voted last month 6-3 to leave the interest rate on hold at 3.85%. According to the RBA’s Statement of Monetary Policy, markets expect a low cash rate of 2.9% by December 2026. The bank’s trimmed mean measure of inflation is also expected to remain at 2.6% for the next two years before dropping to 2.5% by December 2027. RBA lowers its 2025 economic outlook for growth Australia’s central bank lowered its economic outlook for growth in 2025. It warned that the economy cannot sustainably grow faster than 2% per year. The bank now expects productivity to grow by just 0.7% per year over the medium term, down from its previous estimates of 1% annual growth. It also warned that weaker growth meant the economy would be smaller and poorer than it otherwise would have been. The central bank argued that lower productivity growth will eventually weigh on household income, tax revenue, and public spending. It believes that weaker economic growth will cause wages to grow by 3.2% year over year in the long run without fueling inflation. “That challenge has been long-standing. It is also global, as the Reserve Bank points out. But it is substantial, and it is the government’s primary focus — not just next week, at the roundtable, but indeed for the course of this parliamentary term. So we’ve got a big agenda.” -Jim Chalmers, Treasurer of Australia The bank’s warning came just one week before Chalmers’ three-day economic reform summit, including a closed-door meeting of Australia’s government with 24 stakeholders, from businesses and unions. Bullock is also expected to deliver a brief presentation on the first day of the summit, outlining the country’s economic outlook. The country’s economic outlook comes amid a heightened trade war after Trump imposed a baseline 10% tariff on Australia back in April. The bank also argued that the risk of a trade war has diminished and recent international trade policy developments have had little impact on its economy to date. Don’t just read crypto news.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-is-bullish-for-xrp-over-the-next-12-months-heres-why/,"Ripple’s recent activities in the banking and stablecoin sectors have been the subject of speculation, but a brief exchange on X has provided a clearer glimpse into one possible direction. Responding to a question about when XRP will start growing, Bob Way (@bob_way), a popular crypto commentator, outlined how two elements, the RLUSD stablecoin and a pending banking license application, could form the foundation for a major expansion. He described the end of the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC as an important factor in enabling these plans, adding that he is highly optimistic about developments over the coming 12 months, including potential moves in international markets. RLUSD and Ripple’s banking license application is key to new value creation. The law suit finality is key to smoothing that process. I’m very bullish over the next 12 months. — Bob Way (@bob_way) August 10, 2025 Potential Impact on XRP Ripple has applied for a national trust bank charter from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. If approved, this license would allow the company to operate as a federally regulated trust bank, provide custody for digital assets, and manage RLUSD reserves under direct federal oversight. Such a framework could provide the regulatory foundation needed to support large-scale institutional use, as counterparties often require operations to be conducted within a licensed banking environment. The charter, combined with the stability of a fully regulated RLUSD , could enable new settlement pathways in which XRP serves as a bridge asset for cross-border transactions. This arrangement would reduce reliance on traditional correspondent banking and potentially increase demand for XRP in providing liquidity and rapid settlement. While these developments could lead to higher transaction volumes and deeper market integration, their success would still depend on regulatory approvals in other jurisdictions and Ripple’s effective execution. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Operational and Strategic Considerations With RLUSD already dominating the market , Ripple’s focus shifts to scaling the stablecoin within a compliant, high-assurance framework. The pursuit of a national trust bank charter would formalize its role as custodian of RLUSD reserves under federal oversight, adding a layer of regulatory credibility that could attract larger institutional participants. International expansion remains a parallel priority. Securing approvals in non-US jurisdictions could allow Ripple to introduce RLUSD, XRP, and related services more quickly in regions where digital asset regulations are already established. This strategy demands close coordination with local regulators and adaptation of operational models to fit jurisdiction-specific requirements, ensuring that the stablecoin’s deployment meets both domestic and international compliance expectations. Ripple plans to establish a stronger position in both the stablecoin sector and cross-border settlement markets. For XRP, this would mean an environment where legal and regulatory clarity enables broader adoption, and Way believes the next 12 months could be transformative for the asset.

After a period of impressive gains, Bitcoin’s rally appears to be losing steam. Analysts are now warning that the leading digital asset may have entered a critical “distribution phase” according to Wyckoff analysis, potentially signaling a significant downturn. This shift could see prices testing lower levels, with some projections pointing towards the $95,000 mark. Understanding these market dynamics is crucial for anyone navigating the volatile crypto landscape. What is Wyckoff Distribution and Why Does it Matter for Bitcoin? The Wyckoff Method is a technical analysis approach used to identify market cycles, often categorized into accumulation, markup, distribution, and markdown phases. When we talk about Wyckoff distribution , we are referring to a period where large institutional investors are selling their holdings to the public. This phase typically occurs after a significant uptrend and is characterized by: Weakening Momentum: The upward movement becomes less aggressive. Higher Volume on Down Moves: More selling pressure emerges. Failure to Make New Highs: Price struggles to surpass previous peaks. For Bitcoin, entering this phase suggests that the bull run might be pausing, or even reversing, as smart money exits the market. Decoding Key Bitcoin Analysis Signals Several technical indicators support the view that Bitcoin is in a distribution phase. According to ZAYK Charts, a prominent analyst, the current market shows clear signs of weakening momentum. This is a critical observation in any comprehensive Bitcoin analysis . A notable red flag is the bearish Relative Strength Index (RSI) divergence. This occurs when the price makes a higher high, but the RSI makes a lower high, indicating underlying weakness in the upward trend. It suggests that buyers are losing conviction, and sellers might soon gain control. Traders are closely monitoring these signals, as they often precede a shift to a “markdown phase,” where prices experience a more rapid decline. Critical Bitcoin Support Level to Watch Should the distribution phase lead to a markdown, a key area for potential support is the $92,000–$95,000 zone. This range has historically acted as a significant Bitcoin support level , proving resilient against previous downturns. Its importance stems from prior price action, where buyers stepped in to prevent further declines. A breach of this crucial zone could open the door for even lower prices. Conversely, a strong bounce from this level might indicate a temporary reprieve or a consolidation before another move. Investors should pay close attention to how Bitcoin reacts around this price range. Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends Beyond technical patterns, broader economic factors also influence current crypto market trends . Traders are keeping a close eye on the $117,000 CME futures gap, which represents a price discrepancy. These gaps often act as magnets for price, suggesting Bitcoin might eventually attempt to “fill” this gap. Furthermore, the upcoming U.S. CPI (Consumer Price Index) report is a significant event. Inflation data heavily impacts investor sentiment and central bank policies, which in turn can sway the crypto market. A higher-than-expected CPI could fuel fears of tighter monetary policy, potentially adding downward pressure on risk assets like Bitcoin. Actionable Insights for Investors: Stay Informed: Keep up with technical analysis and macroeconomic news. Risk Management: Consider setting stop-loss orders or reducing exposure. Long-Term View: For long-term holders, corrections can present buying opportunities. The current signals, particularly the Wyckoff distribution phase and bearish divergences, paint a cautious picture for Bitcoin’s immediate future. While no outcome is guaranteed, the potential for Bitcoin to retest the $95,000 support level is a scenario investors should be prepared for. Staying vigilant and understanding these complex market signals is paramount in making informed decisions in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Wyckoff distribution phase? A1: The Wyckoff distribution phase is a period in market cycles where large investors strategically sell their assets, typically after a significant price rally. It is characterized by slowing upward momentum and increasing selling pressure, often preceding a price decline. Q2: Why is the $95,000 level important for Bitcoin? A2: The $92,000–$95,000 zone has historically served as a strong Bitcoin support level . Analysts are watching it closely because if Bitcoin’s price falls into this range, it will test whether buyers are still strong enough to prevent further drops. Q3: How does the Relative Strength Index (RSI) divergence signal a risk? A3: A bearish RSI divergence happens when Bitcoin’s price makes a new high, but its RSI indicator makes a lower high. This suggests that the upward momentum is weakening, even if the price is still climbing, often foreshadowing a potential price reversal downwards. Q4: What is the significance of the U.S. CPI report for crypto market trends? A4: The U.S. CPI report measures inflation; its results can significantly influence investor sentiment and central bank policies, directly impacting Bitcoin and broader crypto market trends . Higher inflation might lead to tighter monetary policy, which can be negative for risk assets. Q5: What should investors do if Bitcoin enters a markdown phase? A5: If Bitcoin enters a markdown phase, investors should consider reviewing their risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders or re-evaluating their portfolio exposure. For long-term investors, it might present a potential buying opportunity, but careful timing and thorough research are advised. Did you find this analysis helpful?

Ethereum rides bullish momentum toward $20K, and XLM emerges as a surprise leader post-SEC clarity. Meanwhile, a fully audited, fast-growing payments token is drawing significant community trust heading into 2025. Ripple Eyes $21 Trillion SWIFT Share At the 2025 XRPL Apex event in Singapore, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse projected that the XRP Ledger could handle 14% of SWIFT’s $150 trillion annual transaction volume within five years. That equates to $21 trillion flowing through XRPL yearly. Based on a conservative turnover rate of 30 cycles per token annually, an analysis suggests a liquidity pool of $700 billion would be needed — implying a base utility price of $11.90 per XRP. With speculative demand factored in, prices could climb to $17.85 or even $23.81, positioning XRP for potential double-digit gains if adoption stays on track. Ethereum Poised for $20K Breakout Ethereum has reclaimed the $4,200 mark for the first time since 2024, igniting bullish forecasts of a run toward $20,000. Trader Merlijn highlights ETH’s movement within a rising price channel that has only been tapped twice before — both times leading to major rallies. Momentum indicators, including a reset RSI, suggest the “ignition sequence” is set for liftoff. Against Bitcoin, ETH still needs 150% upside to revisit its all-time high ratio, but institutional buying and a strong weekly close could push the asset into price discovery mode within weeks. XLM Surges as Regulatory Clouds Clear With the long-standing XRP vs. SEC legal battle now closed, Stellar (XLM) has emerged as one of the month’s top performers, up 56% in 30 days and breaking key resistance at $0.46. Analysts point to a bullish MACD cross, strong long/short ratios, and an upcoming Protocol 23 upgrade enhancing smart contract capabilities. If momentum holds, XLM could rally another 116% to hit $1, a milestone that would mark a new all-time high. The rally is fueling hopes of an early altcoin season as traders rotate into other payment-focused and utility-driven tokens. MAGACOIN FINANCE Builds Trust With Security-First Approach MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a payments-sector contender by prioritizing security and transparency. The project’s smart contract has undergone rigorous audits, including a completed HashEx review and an ongoing CertiK audit, earning a perfect 100/100 Trust Score on Scam-Detector. Its anti-phishing measures and wallet compatibility standards have helped it attract over 18,000 investors in its presale phase, building a loyal community that sees trust and audit verification as essential to long-term adoption. Conclusion With XRP chasing a multi-trillion-dollar market share, Ethereum preparing for a possible $20K surge, and XLM breaking out on fresh regulatory clarity, the payments token race is intensifying. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s security-first reputation and rapidly growing community put it in a strong position to compete.

The agreement also applies to AMD, making it one of the rare times U.S. export controls have been tied directly to a financial payment. The decision reverses an earlier ban his own administration put in place and adds a new dimension to U.S. national security policy, one where access to restricted technology can come with a price tag. For decades, Washington blocked sales of sensitive technology to foreign countries based only on security concerns, with no room for negotiation. If a product was restricted, companies could not buy their way into an exception. Trump not only made the H20 deal but also said he would consider letting Nvidia sell a reduced-performance version of its high-end Blackwell chips to China. The H20 ban, imposed months ago, was lifted in July as part of discussions with Beijing over rare earth minerals. Lawmakers question national security impact Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress criticized the move, warning it risks setting up what they see as a “pay-for-play” system for sensitive technology exports. John Moolenaar, chair of the House Select Committee on China, said export controls protect national security and “we should not set a precedent that incentivizes the government to grant licenses to sell China technology that will enhance its AI capabilities.” Raja Krishnamoorthi, the committee’s top Democrat, said charging a fee sends the message that “American national security principles are negotiable for the right fee.” The administration argues the security risk is low because the H20 chip was already widely sold in China before the ban. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC the H20 is Nvidia’s “fourth-best chip” and said it benefits the U.S. for Chinese companies to continue using American hardware instead of turning to alternatives. Legal concerns and financial consequences The legality of Trump’s revenue-sharing arrangement is unclear. The U.S. Constitution bars Congress from imposing taxes or duties on exports. Trade lawyer Jeremy Iloulian said it’s hard to know if the payment counts as an export tax without more details, but noted that “there has never been a consideration of how much companies need to pay to receive an export license.” Kyle Handley, a trade policy professor, said, “It sure looks like an export tax to me … they can call it whatever they want.” Nvidia did not confirm the 15% figure but said it follows U.S. government rules. A spokesperson said the company has not shipped H20 chips to China for months and hopes export rules will allow it to compete in China and globally. AMD confirmed it has approval to export some AI processors to China but did not comment on any revenue-sharing deal, saying only that it complies with export laws. Sarah Kreps, a professor at Cornell University, said the deal reflects a broader pattern where “everything now in this administration seems negotiable in ways that were not the case before,” adding she expects more agreements like this in the future. Financial analysts warned the levy could cut profit margins on China-bound processors by 5 to 15 percentage points, reducing Nvidia and AMD’s overall margins by about one point. Bernstein analysts called it “a slippery slope,” suggesting it could encourage Washington to apply similar payments to other critical U.S. exports. Hendi Susanto, a portfolio manager at Gabelli, said companies selling strategic goods to China will now question if the same model will apply to them, calling remittance “a burden, or a lifeline to preserve market access to huge and growing opportunities in China.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

A close above these points could open the way toward $4,800–$5,000, in line with analyst estimates.

Heavy ETF inflows, corporate buying, and low exchange reserves are bullish factors , but overbought readings suggest short-term caution. ETH is still 12% below its all-time high. Strong institutional buying and favorable on-chain data keep $5,000 in sight in the weeks ahead. Market Performance and 24-Hour Outlook Ethereum (ETH) was trading at $4,300 at press time, with 24-hour trading volume of $39.2 billion. The price is up 0.03% in the past day and 17% over the past week. In the last 24 hours, ETH traded between $4,170 and $4,347. Over the week, the range was $3,560 to $4,330. ETH is currently about 12% below its all-time high of $4,878 from November 10, 2021. Recent trading sessions have been marked by strong volume and large inflows into spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Monday recorded $1.01 billion in net inflows to these funds, the highest on record. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) took in $640 million, and Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH) added $277 million. Moreover, Ethereum now ranks 22nd among the world’s largest assets by market capitalization, ahead of Mastercard and Netflix. Reflecting its expanding role both in crypto and among traditional global assets, market analyst Rand noted, “$ETH just surpassed Mastercard and Netflix on MarketCap valuation, taking the Global 22nd rank position.” GM guys! $ETH just surpassed Mastercard and Netflix on MarketCap valuation, taking the Global 22nd rank position pic.twitter.com/p4bKLy4Ncb — Rand (@crypto_rand) August 12, 2025 Technical Analysis On the daily chart, ETH trades above the upper Bollinger Band, which sits near $4,344. This position often points to strong bullish momentum but can also mean overbought conditions. The bands are wider than earlier in the year, showing higher market volatility. Source: TradingView Meanwhile, the 14-period Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 73. Readings above 70 can indicate overbought conditions. The RSI has held above 50 since mid-July, showing sustained buying strength. Analyst ZYN noted , “This RSI trendline has perfectly marked ETH tops… I think $ETH local top could happen around $4.8K-$5K this time.” Open interest in ETH derivatives is at $10 billion on Binance, up 46% in 30 days.

Around 30% of the ETH supply is staked, while exchange reserves are near historic lows. Long-Term Holder Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) data from April showed most holders in a loss when ETH was near $1,800. By late July, with ETH over $3,000, the NUPL moved into the “belief” zone, meaning most holders are now in profit. Source: Ali Martinez/X Corporate buying is also strong. BitMine Immersion (BMNR) disclosed holdings of more than 1.15 million ETH, valued at $4.9 billion, making it the largest corporate ETH holder. This is an increase of 317,000 ETH in one week. ETF demand remains a key factor. Ether ETFs have drawn more inflows than Bitcoin ETFs, with some analysts saying these products were initially underestimated. Nate Geraci commented, “Feel like spot eth ETFs were severely underestimated simply [because] tradfi investors didn’t understand eth,” adding that institutions now view Ethereum as the “backbone of future financial markets.” Broader Market Context Market sentiment is influenced by expectations of interest rate cuts, looser liquidity rules, and possible inflows from retirement accounts and institutional funds. Commentator Ted pointed to factors including pro-crypto laws, ETF expansion, bank capital changes, and large cash reserves in money markets that could enter the market. Altcoin market value is approaching a resistance level that led to a 50% drop in late 2024.

Ethereum price forecasts outline potential future ranges using market trends, technical signals, and blockchain data. They are not assured outcomes. In fact, the market can change quickly due to global economic shifts, policy moves, or changes in investor behavior. A move to $5K is possible if current momentum holds. Chart patterns, past RSI readings, and moving averages can provide guidance, but they are most effective when combined with on-chain metrics and trading flow data. No single measure can guarantee results. How Are Ethereum Price Predictions Made? Forecasts often combine three main approaches. Technical analysis examines charts, moving averages, and indicators like RSI to find likely support and resistance levels. On-chain analysis reviews wallet movements, staking figures, and exchange balances to see how participants are positioning. Macro analysis considers interest rates, liquidity levels, and institutional adoption. By combining these, analysts can form a scenario for likely price direction and key levels to watch.

A significant development recently emerged from Binance: Binance Alpha OVL , the dedicated platform for promising early-stage crypto projects within the Binance Wallet, has officially added Overlay Protocol (OVL) to its roster. This move signals a new phase for on-chain trading and highlights Binance’s commitment to fostering nascent digital assets. What is Binance Alpha and Why Does it Matter for Overlay Protocol ? Binance Alpha serves as a crucial gateway for groundbreaking, early-stage crypto projects. It is an integral part of the Binance Wallet ecosystem, designed to provide users with direct access to on-chain trading opportunities. By integrating directly with both the Binance Wallet and the broader Binance Exchange, Binance Alpha bridges the gap between innovative new protocols and a vast user base. Early Access: Users gain the ability to interact with promising projects before they hit mainstream markets. On-Chain Trading: The platform facilitates direct transactions on the blockchain, enhancing transparency and user control. Binance Integration: Seamless connection with the Binance Wallet offers a familiar and secure environment for participants. The addition of Overlay Protocol (OVL) to this exclusive platform is a testament to its perceived potential. It indicates that OVL has met certain criteria for innovation and utility, positioning it for greater visibility within the crypto community. Understanding Overlay Protocol and Its Role in Binance Early-Stage Crypto Overlay Protocol (OVL) is now part of the select group of projects featured on Binance Alpha. While specific details about OVL’s functionality are best found directly from its official sources, its inclusion on Binance Alpha suggests it aims to offer novel solutions within the decentralized finance (DeFi) or broader blockchain space. Early-stage crypto projects often push boundaries, introducing new concepts for trading, governance, or data management. Binance Alpha’s focus on these emerging assets provides a unique environment. It allows users to engage with projects like OVL at an initial phase, potentially participating in their growth journey. This strategy aligns with Binance’s vision of supporting the entire lifecycle of crypto innovation, from inception to wider adoption. The Power of On-Chain Trading with Binance Alpha The core functionality of Binance Alpha revolves around on-chain trading. This means transactions occur directly on the blockchain, rather than through an off-chain order book managed by an exchange. This approach offers several benefits for users engaging with projects like Overlay Protocol: Transparency: All transactions are verifiable on the blockchain. Control: Users maintain direct control over their assets within their Binance Wallet. Decentralization: It aligns with the ethos of decentralized finance by reducing reliance on centralized intermediaries for specific trading activities. This method of trading is crucial for early-stage projects, as it allows for direct interaction with their underlying smart contracts and mechanisms. It empowers users to explore new DeFi primitives and innovative financial instruments that these protocols might offer. Future Outlook and Navigating the Binance Wallet Integration While the addition of OVL to Binance Alpha is a significant step, it is important to understand the future possibilities.

A massive whale ETH movement has just sent ripples through the cryptocurrency market. In a significant development, approximately 14,942 unstaked Ethereum , valued at an astounding $64.4 million, recently found its way into Binance Exchange. This substantial ETH Binance deposit , identified across three linked wallets by blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, immediately sparked discussions about potential Ethereum price implications and the broader impact of crypto whale activity . Unstaked Ethereum: What’s Behind the Big Move? According to data from Lookonchain, three distinct wallets, believed to be under the control of a single large investor or “whale cluster,” initiated this notable transfer. They first unstaked their substantial Ethereum holdings. Following this, the entirety of the 14,942 ETH, amounting to roughly $64.38 million, was swiftly deposited onto Binance Exchange. Unstaking Ethereum involves moving previously locked ETH, often from staking protocols, back into a liquid state. This action makes the assets readily available for trading, transferring, or selling. When such a large quantity of unstaked Ethereum enters an exchange, market participants often interpret it as a signal of intent to sell. Decoding the ETH Binance Deposit: Is a Sell-Off Imminent? The immediate question on everyone’s mind is: does this massive ETH Binance deposit indicate an impending sell-off? Historically, large deposits to centralized exchanges like Binance are often precursors to selling activity. Whales might be looking to offload a portion of their holdings, potentially taking profits or rebalancing their portfolios. However, it is crucial to remember that a deposit does not automatically equate to a sale. There are several reasons why a whale might move significant funds to an exchange: Liquidity Management: They might be preparing for a large purchase of another asset. Derivatives Trading: The ETH could be used as collateral for futures or options trading. Arbitrage Opportunities: Moving funds to capitalize on price differences across exchanges. Consolidation: Simplifying their holdings by moving them to a single platform. Therefore, while the market typically reacts cautiously to such moves, a definitive conclusion about selling intent cannot be drawn solely from the deposit itself. Understanding Crypto Whale Activity and its Market Influence Crypto whale activity refers to the actions of individuals or entities holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency. Due to their sheer volume of assets, their moves can significantly influence market dynamics. When a whale makes a large transaction, it often grabs headlines and can lead to: Increased Volatility: Sudden buying or selling pressure can cause rapid price swings. Sentiment Shifts: Other investors often try to front-run or follow whale movements, impacting overall market sentiment. Liquidity Impact: Large orders can absorb significant liquidity, affecting order books. Monitoring these large movements provides valuable, though not always conclusive, insights into potential market shifts. This particular whale ETH movement is no exception, drawing close attention from traders and analysts alike. What are the Potential Ethereum Price Implications? The immediate Ethereum price implications of this deposit are a subject of intense speculation. If the whale indeed intends to sell a substantial portion of the 14,942 ETH, it could introduce significant selling pressure, potentially leading to a short-term price dip for Ethereum. The sheer volume of $64.4 million is considerable enough to impact market liquidity, especially during periods of lower trading volume. Conversely, if the ETH is moved for reasons other than selling, such as using it for DeFi protocols, staking, or OTC (over-the-counter) deals not visible on public exchanges, the market impact might be minimal or even positive if it signals further engagement with the ecosystem. Investors should watch for subsequent transactions from these wallets or the price action on Binance. Navigating the Signals: What Should Investors Consider? For investors, understanding such large transfers is key to navigating the volatile crypto landscape. While a whale ETH movement can be a bearish signal, it is essential to consider the broader market context. Look at: Overall Market Trends: Is the general market sentiment bullish or bearish? On-Chain Data: Are other large holders also moving funds? News and Developments: Are there any fundamental reasons for a whale to act? In this case, the significant unstaked Ethereum deposit to Binance serves as a powerful reminder of the influence of large holders and the need for a nuanced understanding of on-chain data. It underscores the importance of not reacting impulsively to single data points. In conclusion, the substantial ETH Binance deposit of $64.4 million from an apparent whale cluster has certainly caught the market’s attention. While such movements often hint at potential selling pressure, the true Ethereum price implications remain to be seen. As the crypto market continues to evolve, keeping a close eye on crypto whale activity provides crucial insights, but always remember to combine these signals with a broader market analysis. The coming days will reveal the true intentions behind this significant whale ETH movement . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when a whale unstakes ETH? A: Unstaking ETH means a large holder has moved their previously locked Ethereum (often from staking protocols) back into a liquid state, making it available for immediate trading or transfer. Q2: Why is an ETH deposit to Binance considered significant? A: Large deposits to centralized exchanges like Binance are often interpreted as a potential signal that the holder intends to sell, as exchanges are the primary venues for converting crypto to fiat or other cryptocurrencies. Q3: Do all large exchange deposits necessarily lead to selling? A: No, not all deposits result in sales. Whales might deposit funds for various reasons, including liquidity management, derivatives trading, arbitrage, or consolidating holdings. Q4: How can crypto whale activity affect market prices? A: Due to the large volume of their holdings, crypto whales can significantly influence market dynamics. Their large transactions can lead to increased volatility, shifts in market sentiment, and impacts on liquidity. Q5: What should investors consider when observing such large ETH movements? A: Investors should consider the broader market context, other on-chain data, and relevant news.

Led by Senator Kelda Roys with support from six other lawmakers, Senate Bill 386 mirrors a companion measure that was already filed in the State Assembly last month. Across both SB 386 and the Assembly Bill 384, filed by Rep. Ryan Spaude (D-Wis.), lawmakers want to place cryptocurrency kiosk operators under the state’s money transmitter licensing system and add new layers of oversight for machines scattered across convenience stores, gas stations, and other retail spaces. Crypto ATMs are accessories in crime Wisconsin lawmakers have fast-tracked the measures in response to an uptick in fraud cases where bad actors have used crypto ATMs as a tool to dupe victims. The Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network recently released a report highlighting that the number of crypto ATM related fraud complaints jumped 99% in 2024. Over $247 million was reportedly lost to these incidents, marking a 31% hike. Supporters of the measure argue that the largely unregulated nature of these terminals makes them a soft target for scammers, often preying on elderly residents and vulnerable communities. As such, regulators have proposed a framework that they believe would keep the more than 500 Bitcoin ATMs currently active within the state in check. How will Wisconsin regulate crypto ATMs? Under the proposed framework, any operator of a virtual currency kiosk in Wisconsin would need to obtain a state money transmitter license. Every kiosk would be required to display a prominent “Fraud Alert” both on its physical casing and electronically on the transaction screen. The warning, printed in at least 20-point type, would outline common scam tactics—such as impersonating loved ones, government agencies, or law enforcement—and warn users not to proceed if instructed to send virtual currency by someone they do not know. Every customer would have to acknowledge the warning before they would be able to transact. As an added layer of protection, first-time users will be required to submit their full legal name, date of birth, address, phone number, and email, along with a government-issued photo ID. For all other subsequent transactions, customers would be required to verify their identities, and a photo of the customer would be taken at the kiosk. Transaction limits and refunds Another key protection measure is a daily transaction limit of $1,000 per customer. For operators, the bill requires that fees be capped at the greater of $5 or 3% of the transaction amount. SB 386 also mandates a refund obligation, wherein victims of fraud would have a chance of recovering any lost cryptocurrencies if they notify both the operator and law enforcement within 30 days of the incident. No tolerance policy in the US As of August 12, at least five US states have introduced similar rules, with some even going as far as placing outright bans on crypto ATMs. In June, Spokane, Washington, became the first city in the state to outlaw the machines entirely. Operators were given 60 days to pull out more than 40 kiosks after police linked them to a surge in scams, many of which funnelled money overseas. Similarly, Grosse Pointe Farms , a small town in Michigan, which doesn’t even host any cryptocurrency ATMs, revealed plans to enforce strict mandates for ATM operators last month. Nebraska chose tighter controls instead of a ban. Its Controllable Electronic Record Fraud Prevention Act requires licensing, sets a $2,000 daily limit for new users, caps fees at 18%, and forces operators to issue refunds to scam victims who file reports within 90 days. Meanwhile, North Dakota is weighing its own version of rules, with daily limits, fraud alerts, and blockchain analytics to keep suspicious activity in check.

This has also positively impacted spot ETH ETFs. As ETH continues its steady rise, US spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net inflow of $1.02 billion on August 12, data shows. Accordingly, the total net inflow of spot Ethereum ETFs reached an all-time high, while BlackRock's Ethereum ETF ETHA also recorded the largest net inflow in history. The $1.02 billion inflow was the largest single-day total since the ETH ETF's launch. It also marked the first time daily inflows exceeded $1 billion. According to Farside Investors data, BlackRock’s ETHA fund led the way with $639.8 million in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FETH fund with $276.9 million and Grayscale’s mini ETH fund with $66.6 million. Grayscale's ETHE fund saw inflows of $13 million, Van Eck's ETHV fund $9.4 million, Franklin's EZET fund $4.9 million, Bitwise's ETHW fund $4.30 million, and 21Shares' CETH fund $3.9 million. While ETH ETFs saw the largest inflow since their launch, ETF Store president Nate Geraci stated that ETFs are underestimated. Geraci said that ETH ETFs have been underestimated due to institutional investors' lack of understanding of Ethereum to date. However, he added that the situation has changed and institutional investors have started to show interest in ETH and ETH is now being seen as the backbone of the financial markets. “There is a feeling that spot Ethereum ETFs are seriously undervalued because tradfi investors don't understand ETH… Bitcoin had a nice, clean description: “digital gold” However, it takes longer for investors to understand ETH. Now Ethereum is being talked about as the backbone of the future financial markets.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Historic Day for Ethereum: Ethereum ETFs Break Record!

Multiverse Monkey (MMON), the innovative Ethereum-based GameFi project, has just made a groundbreaking announcement on X. They plan to burn an additional 4.5 billion MMON tokens, a move that could significantly reshape the project’s future. This massive MMON token burn follows an initial 1.5 billion tokens already removed from circulation, out of a total supply of 10 billion MMON. It’s a strategic decision designed to create scarcity and potentially enhance value for the community. What Does the MMON Token Burn Mean for Investors? A token burn is essentially the permanent removal of cryptocurrency tokens from circulation. Think of it like taking physical money out of the economy and destroying it. When Multiverse Monkey MMON conducts this large-scale burn, it means those 4.5 billion tokens will never be spent, traded, or used again. This process reduces the total supply of MMON tokens available in the market. Scarcity: Fewer tokens in circulation can make each remaining token more valuable, assuming demand stays constant or increases. Value Proposition: It signals a commitment from the project team to long-term value and sustainability for their community. Investor Confidence: Such a move often boosts investor confidence, showing proactive management of the token economy. Why is Multiverse Monkey MMON Implementing This Strategy? Projects often conduct token burns for several compelling reasons. For Multiverse Monkey MMON, this strategy aims to bolster the token’s economics. By reducing the supply, the team intends to create a deflationary mechanism that can benefit holders. This approach aligns with common practices in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and GameFi sectors, where managing token supply is crucial for a healthy ecosystem. It demonstrates a clear vision for the project’s economic future and its dedication to enhancing the value proposition for its users and investors. How Does a GameFi Token Burn Impact Value? In the context of GameFi, a token burn holds particular significance. GameFi tokens like MMON are not just speculative assets; they often have utility within the game’s ecosystem, used for in-game purchases, rewards, or governance. When a GameFi token burn occurs, it can directly influence the in-game economy. For instance, if MMON tokens are used to purchase in-game assets, a reduced supply could make those assets more valuable or increase the demand for the remaining tokens. This can lead to a stronger and more vibrant in-game economy, benefiting players and token holders alike. Moreover, it strengthens the overall appeal of the Multiverse Monkey MMON project. What is the Cryptocurrency Burn Process? The process of a cryptocurrency burn is transparent and verifiable on the blockchain. Tokens are sent to a specific wallet address known as a ‘burner address’ or ‘null address.’ This address has no private key, meaning no one can ever access or spend the tokens sent to it. Once tokens are sent to this address, they are permanently removed from the circulating supply. This method ensures that the burn is irreversible and auditable by anyone on the Ethereum blockchain. It builds trust within the community, as the action is provable and not just an announcement. The Multiverse Monkey MMON team will provide transaction hashes for the burn, allowing everyone to verify the action. What is the Potential MMON Price Impact? The announcement of a significant MMON token burn often leads to speculation about its potential impact on the token’s price. While a reduced supply theoretically supports higher prices, several factors influence actual market movements. These include overall market sentiment, project development progress, adoption rates, and broader economic conditions. However, the intention behind such a large-scale burn is to create a positive long-term MMON price impact by making the token more scarce and, therefore, more desirable. Investors and enthusiasts will be closely watching how this strategic move plays out in the market. It’s always wise to conduct your own research and consider market dynamics before making investment decisions. The planned 4.5 billion MMON token burn by Multiverse Monkey MMON is a significant development for the GameFi project. By actively managing its token supply through this cryptocurrency burn, the team aims to enhance scarcity, potentially improve the MMON price impact, and foster a stronger, more sustainable ecosystem. This strategic move highlights Multiverse Monkey’s commitment to its community and the long-term success of its innovative GameFi platform. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Multiverse Monkey MMON? Multiverse Monkey (MMON) is an Ethereum-based GameFi project that combines gaming with decentralized finance, offering users opportunities to play, earn, and engage within its unique ecosystem. Why are tokens burned? Tokens are burned to reduce their total circulating supply, which can increase scarcity and potentially boost the value of the remaining tokens. It’s a common strategy for managing tokenomics and showing commitment to long-term project health. How does the MMON token burn affect the total supply? Multiverse Monkey MMON initially issued 10 billion tokens. With 1.5 billion already burned and an additional 4.5 billion planned, a total of 6 billion MMON tokens will be removed, leaving 4 billion in circulation. Is a token burn good for investors? Generally, a token burn is seen as a positive development for investors as it aims to create scarcity and can lead to an increase in the token’s value. However, actual market performance depends on many factors beyond just the burn. How can I verify the MMON token burn? Token burns are recorded on the blockchain. The Multiverse Monkey team will likely provide transaction hashes (TxIDs) which you can use on an Ethereum block explorer (like Etherscan) to verify that the tokens have been sent to an unrecoverable burn address.

Could this dip take the price back into the bull flag (fakeout), or will this just be a normal retest before $BTC heads back towards its all-time high? Doubts creeping in for the bulls? Source: TradingView When $BTC broke out of its bull flag and surged to just over $122,000 it really did look as though this was going to be the beginning of the next leg higher. Of course, it still may be. There is the possibility that the price has just come back to close the CME gap at $119,000 and test the support at $118,000 before returning to head higher. That said, a few little doubts for the bulls are perhaps creeping in. The price has so far remained around the $119,000 support. Could there be another dip to retest the top of the bull flag? Or in the worst case scenario could the price even reenter the flag and confirm a fakeout? The RSI at the bottom of the chart reveals that the indicator line has crossed down below the uptrend. This is a low time frame, so perhaps too much shouldn’t be drawn into it. However, this trendline did start at the lowest point of the price rally back into the bull flag, and this strong dip below the uptrend of the indicator line looks to be signalling that this particular rally could be over. The Stochastic RSI indicators on this time frame are practically at the bottom, although the 8-hour and 12-hour Stochastic RSIs still require a lot more time to reset. Bearish daily candle for Monday Source: TradingView With one exception, the picture on the daily time frame looks more positive for the bulls. The one exception is the quite negative looking candle for Monday. The strong surge to the upside, followed by the dip back down to support, left a lengthy candle wick behind, which as things stand is revealing a bearish double top pattern. In favour of the bulls, the dip back down tested the support band, which also coincides with the top of the bull flag. There is a small ascending trendline which is so far holding. If the price bounces from here, this will have been a standard test and confirmation of the breakout. At the bottom of the chart, the RSI indicator line will need to be watched closely. There is the possibility that a retest of the descending trendline plus the 50.00 level could take place. $119,000 is major level for rally or breakdown Source: TradingView For the weekly chart view it is still very early to be making any strong assumptions. This said, the $119,000 level can be seen to be the major level for whether this current breakout rally continues, or whether a breakdown back into the bull flag and perhaps an even more bearish scenario plays out. As already mentioned, a confirmation of the bull flag breakout is absolutely fine. The fact that the surge out of the flag was so strong just means that the price has further to come down in order to make this confirmation. At the bottom of the chart the indicators in the Stochastic RSI are making their way down. They may have gone too far down now for a bounce from the 80.00 level, therefore, the next chance for the bulls is at the 50.00 level. If no bounce comes there, these indicators could carry on down to the bottom. If they do, price action is also likely to fall. It would just be a case of how far would it fall before the Stochastic RSI indicators were able to reset and head back up. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

She added , “Holding above 3.20 keeps momentum intact for a move toward the 3.70 target zone. A break above the recent swing high could trigger accelerated gains into the upper resistance range.” Market analyst Lingrid sees XRP’s current action as a healthy bullish consolidation, noting its breakout, $3.00 retest, and steady formation of higher lows along an ascending trendline, a setup that often signals further upside. Why does it matter? Well, post-breakout consolidations are bullish when gains hold above key levels. Analysts see $3.20 as the near-term pivot because a firm hold or decisive reclaim could spark fresh buying. XRP jumped to $3.36 after Ripple and the SEC called it quits, fueled by a 208% surge in volume. Profit-taking has cooled the rally, but solid support at $3.13–$3.15 continues to cap bearish pressure. Back to the Policy Drafting Table With the long-running Ripple–SEC saga officially closed, the agency’s leadership is pivoting from litigation to rulemaking. Chair Paul S. Atkins, responding directly to an X post by Commissioner Hester Peirce, called for moving “from the courtroom to the policy drafting table,” signaling a new regulatory chapter for crypto focused on clear rules over enforcement-by-litigation. With both sides dropping appeals, Judge Analisa Torres’s 2023 rulings stand as final, leaving a $125 million penalty and a narrow injunction on certain institutional sales. The closure lifts years of legal uncertainty over XRP and the wider token market, with participants and lobbyists seizing the moment to push for clear regulatory guardrails over piecemeal court rulings. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, often nicknamed “Crypto Mom” because she is SEC’s most outspoken pro-crypto voice, hailed the case as “A welcome development for many reasons” on X, casting it as a win for clear, commission-led rulemaking. She reiterated her critique that regulatory ambiguity forces innovators into costly court battles that stifle progress, a stance that appears to have spurred Chair Atkins’s push to fast-track policy work. Since his April confirmation, Chair Atkins has steered the SEC toward rulemaking, launching Project Crypto and pledging updates to token classifications, registration paths, and custody standards. The shift, aligned with administration policy and industry calls to reshore innovation, favors predictable regulation over ad hoc enforcement. Conclusion Atkins’s reply to Peirce reflects his regulatory stance, clear and predictable frameworks that foster innovation and capital formation while safeguarding investors. Sworn in as SEC chair in April 2025, he has stressed statutory-like guidance for crypto over ad hoc enforcement outcomes. On the other hand, XRP’s bullish outlook holds if it reclaims $3.20, potentially paving the way to $3.70.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|XRP|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-12 09:49:22
49967916,554222,1754992314,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49967916.jpeg,Best Meme Coins to Buy as Dogecoin Gears Up for 50% Rally,https://bitcoinist.com/best-meme-coins-to-buy-as-dogecoin-gears-up-for-50-rally/,"Dogecoin is catching fire again after months of quiet trading. The price surged nearly 20% in just a week, breaking out of the sleepy range it’s been stuck in for most of the summer. On the charts, traders are watching a bullish ascending triangle form – a classic setup that can spark big moves when resistance breaks. Momentum indicators like the MACD have flipped bullish for the first time in weeks, adding fuel to the optimism. Analysts say a decisive push above $0.25 could open the door to a rally toward $0.36, a gain of about 50%. With meme coin sentiment heating up, this might be the perfect moment to explore the best meme coins to buy right now. Dogecoin’s Bullish Setup The past three months saw Dogecoin stuck in a tight range, up just 7.6% overall, while other top cryptos enjoyed stronger runs. That changed last week as $DOGE jumped 20%, driven by a technical pattern that traders have been watching closely: the ascending triangle. This formation occurs when prices make higher lows while repeatedly testing the same horizontal resistance – in this case, around $0.25. Each higher low signals that buyers are becoming more aggressive, and when paired with rising volume, it often precedes a breakout. If $DOGE closes above $0.25 with strong buying activity, the next technical targets are $0.28 and $0.36 , the latter representing a 50% rally from current prices. The $0.29 mark remains a stubborn ceiling, having rejected $DOGE three times this year, but clearing it could be the final push toward higher highs. In meme coin markets, that kind of setup can ignite broader sector rallies. 1. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – The Ultra-Ripped Doge Prepping for a Bull Market Flex With Dogecoin eyeing a potential 50% breakout, meme traders are scanning the charts for the next canine contender to chase the momentum. Enter Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – the body-building, 1000x-leverage-trading cousin of $DOGE, forged in the chaos of bull markets and fueled by caffeine, green candles, and pure trader delusion. Right now you can buy $MAXI for $0.0002515. Already raising $731K in presale, $MAXI is built to pump with the same conviction that turned early $DOGE believers into legends. Maxi Doge’s branding leans into high-octane meme appeal: he never skips leg day, never touches grass, and never sleeps without a MetaMask tab open. The tokenomics are unapologetically pump-focused, with 25% of supply locked in the $MAXI Fund for marketing, partnerships, and events. Rumors of future integrations with leverage and futures platforms could turn the community into a full-send trading machine, capable of 100x or even 1000x plays. In a market where the Doge narrative is heating up, $MAXI positions itself as the ripped alpha ready to out-pump the pack, and maybe your portfolio along with it. 2. TOKEN6900 ($T6900) – The Only Honest Asset in a Sea of Pretenders With Dogecoin’s chart shaping up for a breakout, some traders want in on meme season without the fluff – and that’s exactly where TOKEN6900 ($T6900) fits. Priced at $0.006925 and already raising $1.8M in its presale, this new crypto project is the anti-S&P500 for the terminally online. No utility, no roadmap, no fake fundamentals – just pure, weaponized meme-fi energy. This project takes inspiration from SPX6900 and early-2000s internet chaos, then turns the dial past ridiculous. It doesn’t follow GDP, oil reserves, or earnings reports. It follows nothing but community-driven collective delusion as liquidity. 80% of the total supply is sold during the crypto presale , capped at $5M, with no extra minting, making it what the founders call the first ‘NCT’ – Non-Corrupt Token. While other meme coins disguise speculation with half-baked roadmaps, TOKEN6900 promises nothing and delivers exactly that. In a market driven by sentiment, that kind of brutal honesty can be strangely refreshing – and perfectly timed if $DOGE’s rally kicks meme mania into overdrive. 3. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) – Meme Coin Meets Real Tech Traction Having heard the news of Dogecoin’s possible breakout, some traders are chasing meme coin thrills – but with a side of infrastructure. That’s where Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) hops into the spotlight. Currently priced at $0.0019 in Stage 10 of its presale, it has raised an impressive $18.9M across nine stages. Built on its own Ethereum-compatible Layer‑2 blockchain, Little Pepe offers zero trading tax, lightning-fast, low-fee transactions, and anti-sniper bot protection – features that make it more than just meme hype. It also packs real utility , including a decentralized Meme Launchpad (called ‘Pepe’s Pump Pad’) and a roadmap that hints at staking, DAO governance, NFT tools, and cross-chain expansion. To stoke excitement, Little Pepe is running a $777K giveaway, with ten lucky presale participants each winning $77K in tokens for qualifying social engagement and a minimum $100 presale purchase. With Ethereum’s usage hitting new highs and meme coin sentiment revving up, Little Pepe is carving a spot for itself at the intersection of meme mania and real infrastructure. Final Pumps Before the $DOGE Run When Dogecoin makes its move, the meme coin tide can lift more than just the original dog. Maxi Doge brings the muscle and market grind, TOKEN6900 delivers pure meme-fueled chaos, and Little Pepe adds real infrastructure to the hype.

Set for August 14, this event introduces Cherry AI (AIBOT) to the broader market via PancakeSwap, a leading decentralized exchange. For enthusiasts and investors alike, understanding the implications of this AIBOT token launch is crucial. What is the Cherry AI TGE All About? A Token Generation Event (TGE) is essentially the public debut of a new cryptocurrency token. It’s the moment when a project’s native token is officially released and becomes available for trading on exchanges. In this case, the Cherry AI TGE introduces AIBOT, the native token for the Cherry AI project. While specific details about Cherry AI’s core functionality are still emerging, the name suggests a focus on artificial intelligence within the blockchain space. This could involve AI-powered trading, data analysis, or decentralized AI applications. The TGE is a critical milestone for any blockchain project.

Tempo will be open-source and compatible with TradFi and DeFi platforms. According to the announcement, Tempo will eliminate the current challenges in global payments, including delays and fees associated with traditional banking systems. The blockchain network will operate as open-source, integrating TradFi and DeFi applications. Stripe aims to position itself as an established global financial network amid emerging Web3 technologies. Stripe plans to address performance and reliability issues during peak time with Tempo Tempo was revealed via a job listing on the Blockchain Association’s career section on August 3 for a product marketing position. The advertisement described Tempo as a high-performance, payment-focused blockchain. The blockchain network will be L1, operating on its base network and compatible with Ethereum. The Job posting revealed that the project is in stealth mode and will include a five-person core team. The job has been taken down so far, and neither of the firms has commented on the partnership. Stripe, valued at around $92 billion, has developed several payment solutions, including streamlined online checkout and automated invoicing, which have helped build the company’s reputation. It has also expanded into other avenues, including the stablecoin market. Stripe acquired Bridge, a stablecoin infrastructure company, for $1.1 billion. Bridge enables businesses to integrate and issue stablecoins in their payment flows. The payments company also acquired Privy, a developer of digital asset wallets, in June 2025, gaining the ability to offer wallet services for managing customer holdings. Tempo’s integration into Stripe’s portfolio allows the company to control the settlement infrastructure that processes stablecoins. Some analysts have noted that the proposed blockchain network will help address the current performance and reliability issues faced by payment institutions during peak-volume payment sessions. Stripe yet to disclose Tempo blockchain network specifics Ryan Yoon, Senior Analyst at Tiger Research, revealed that payment-focused blockchains face unpredictable challenges around throughput and cost during volume spikes. He acknowledged that Tempo could introduce deterministic settlement times and fixed fee structures for high-volume payment processing. He added that Stripe’s dependency on external networks would be reduced, minimizing risks from validator congestion. Mehow Pospieszalski, CEO of wallet infrastructure platform American Fortress, highlighted the lack of features such as balance blinding, which hides balances from transaction recipients on multiple existing chains. He added that a combination of dynamic address generation tied to plain-English names would create a privacy-focused experience. Dan Dadybayo, a research and strategy lead at Unstoppable Wallet, acknowledged Stripe’s huge merchant network as a key asset. He added that making the software open-source would be a major differentiator rather than keeping it proprietary. According to some analysts, cryptocurrencies pegged to the USD offer lower fees on cross-border payments compared to traditional methods such as SWIFT or wire transfers. The GENIUS Act, signed into law in July 2025, has provided the stablecoin sector with regulatory guidance, leading to increased momentum. Reportedly , major companies, including Meta, Airbnb, and Apple, are also exploring the introduction of stablecoins. In March, Stripe CEO and co-founder Patrick Collison testified to the U.S. House of Representatives that they are now seeing a meaningful business interest in stablecoins as the underlying technology has matured. Stripe has not disclosed whether it will issue a cryptocurrency token to back Tempo, a common trend among blockchain founders. In the meantime, it has also failed to outline specific features of the blockchain network, including launch time and intended use cases above and beyond payment solutions.

As of August 12, with Bitcoin trading at $118,567, Saylor’s stash of 628,946 BTC is now worth approximately $76.16 billion, according to wallet tracking data.

Michael Saylor's STRATEGY has over $30 BILLION in unrealized Bitcoin profits 🤯 pic.twitter.com/z0rNxQrJRi — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) August 11, 2025 Strategy adds 155 BTC The latest boost follows Strategy’s recent purchase of 155 BTC for roughly $18 million, a move that underscores Saylor’s unwavering belief in Bitcoin as “digital gold” and the ultimate treasury reserve asset. Since adopting its Bitcoin-first balance sheet strategy in 2020, the company has continued to accumulate coins through both bull and bear markets, positioning itself as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder by a wide margin. For context, legendary investor Michael Burry made roughly $700 million from his famous “Big Short” trade during the 2008 financial crisis , an amount dwarfed by Saylor’s current paper gains. With Bitcoin approaching its all-time highs and institutional demand accelerating, MicroStrategy’s balance sheet strategy has transformed the company into a de facto Bitcoin ETF , but one run by perhaps the most vocal BTC evangelist in the corporate world.

Its Layer-2 network, Shibarium, is processing millions of daily transactions, while token burns have accelerated — key ingredients that could set up a strong breakout. If SHIB can clear key resistance levels, the door could open to its next major rally. While the headlines often focus on meme coin heavyweights, PEPE and DOGE are also in strong contention for short-term upside. Both have reclaimed important technical levels, fueled by community engagement and active whale participation. But the search for the Top Altcoin to buy is extending beyond the established names — and that’s where small-cap breakout candidates like MAGACOIN FINANCE are coming into play. Meme Coin Momentum Still Strong Meme coins have historically thrived in bullish market phases, where sentiment and speculative capital move quickly. PEPE has recently bounced from key support with bullish technical indicators pointing toward potential higher targets. DOGE, the original meme coin leader, is still maintaining its place among the top cryptocurrencies by market cap, buoyed by an active global community and high-profile holders. Why SHIB’s Breakout Potential Is Still in Play SHIB’s long-term appeal goes beyond meme culture. The Shibarium Layer-2 solution has expanded its use cases, enabling faster transactions and reduced fees for decentralized applications. Regular token burns help control circulating supply, while whale accumulation suggests strong confidence in its growth potential. If SHIB maintains its adoption pace and continues strengthening network fundamentals, it could be well-positioned for its next rally cycle. Early Access to MAGACOIN FINANCE: Unlock a 50% Bonus For investors who excel at spotting promising projects before they hit the big stage, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most talked-about early plays in the market. The project offers VIP Priority Access with a 50% token bonus for participants who use the code EXTRA50X . These kinds of incentives are designed to reward fast movers, helping build a strong community and deep liquidity well ahead of any public exchange debut. Historically, structured bonus allocations have often led to stronger post-launch engagement, particularly when timed during a bullish sentiment cycle. While no bonus can guarantee future gains, it can give traders an edge in building their position before momentum picks up. And in markets where meme-powered tokens often set the pace, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as one of the most intriguing opportunities to watch this cycle. Outlook: Big Caps Lead, Small Caps Catch Up As the market countdown to the upcoming altcoin season , the current meme coin rally shows that capital often rotates from established leaders into smaller, higher-upside plays. While SHIB, PEPE, and DOGE remain dominant, trader focus inevitably shifts toward newer entrants offering a mix of cultural relevance and functional utility. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one such project gaining traction — blending meme-powered branding with governance capabilities and a tightening supply. For investors seeking the Top Altcoin to buy ahead of the next rotation, small-cap opportunities like this could deliver the kind of explosive returns that defined earlier bull runs.

In recent times, there are a total of 30 of these indicators that are being tracked on the Coinglass website to see when they would be triggered. Interestingly, none of these 30 indicators have been triggered, suggesting that the crypto market has yet to reach the top of the bull cycle, and there could still be more rallies coming. The 30 Indicators That Predict The Bitcoin Market Top The Bitcoin Bull Market Peak Indicators tracked on the Coinglass website help to show when it is a good time to get out of the market. Basically, trying to time and sell at the top . These indicators have all progressed over the last few years as the price has wobbled with no success so far. The images below show the complete list of indicators being tracked and their progress: As can be seen in the image above, there are some of the indicators that have actually progressed quite far, with some already crossing into the 90% territory. But so far, none of these have been triggered to show that the Bitcoin market is actually nearing the top of this bull market cycle. What this suggests is that it is not time to start selling, as it is possible that the market will continue to rally . Thus, it might be a good time to keep holding Bitcoin and the likes for the time being. To accurately mark the top of the Bitcoin bull cycle, multiple of these long-term indicators would have to be triggered before a top can be called. Altcoin Season Has Still Not Begun Not only has none of the 30 indicators tracking the Bitcoin cycle top been triggered, there is also the fact that the market is yet to see an altcoin season . Historically, altcoin seasons have been part of each cycle, and their completion tends to be one of the markers of a possible cycle top. So far, the Altcoin Season Index has yet to reach the 75 mark required for the altcoin season to officially resume. A mark of 75 would mean that 75 of the top 100 altcoins by market cap are outperforming the Bitcoin price on a 90-day basis. However, despite the recent rally, the Altcoin Season Index is still sitting below 40. According to data from the CoinMarketCap website, only 33 of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin’s 13.66% hike in the last three months, while others have fallen below it. Thus, the market is yet to see a proper altcoin season this cycle .",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-12 10:00:17
49968066,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=803156,1754992819,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/49968066.jpeg,"XRP Double-Bottom Breakout Sets Sights On $34, Predicts Analyst",https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-double-bottom-breakout-34-predicts-analyst/,"Gert van Lagen says the macro structure of XRP has finally done the one thing it needed to do: break the neckline of a seven-year base and hold it. “XRP [2W] – Ripple is ready to rip. The 7-year double bottom has broken out at ❌ The neckline was successfully retested at 🔵 ATH cleared — first target near ~$34, at 2.00 fib. extension of double bottom. → Compare with 2014–2017 setup,” the analyst wrote. His chart is drawn on a logarithmic scale with two-week candles, framing the move as a multi-cycle reversal rather than a short-term pop. Could XRP Really Hit $34? The geometry is clear on the chart. A broad W-shaped base stretching from the 2018–2024 bear market carved twin lows in the sub-$0.20–$0.30 region, then returned to a horizontal neckline that sits just above the $2 handle. Van Lagen marks an initial breakout attempt with a red cross just over that barrier, followed by a decisive surge and a pullback that tags support around the $2 area, annotated with a blue dot. On a log chart, that textbook breakout-retest sequence is the confirmation step technicians typically look for before projecting targets. Price at the time of the snapshot is labeled $3.19 on the right axis, meaning XRP is trading above the neckline but still below the 2018 all-time high at $3.40. That placement matters because the prior macro cap now acts as support; staying north of roughly $2.00 keeps the double-bottom thesis intact. The measured arrow drawn from the neckline replicates the height of the base on a multiplicative (log) basis, which is why the upside extension leaps into the mid-double digits rather than adding only a few dollars. Related Reading: BlackRock Addresses Burning XRP ETF Question: Is A Filing Coming Or Not? Van Lagen’s first objective is derived explicitly from Fibonacci proportions. He sets the 2.00 extension of the double-bottom as the initial target, landing “near ~$34.” On his scale the projected path peaks above the $27 and $20 grid lines and briefly tags the mid-$30s before mean-reverting, consistent with how log-scale extensions translate when a long consolidation unwinds quickly. The left side of the graphic provides the historical rhyme he wants readers to notice. Between 2014 and 2017, XRP built a smaller double-bottom within a shaded accumulation zone, broke its neckline, retested it, and then accelerated vertically. Van Lagen marks that sequence with the same red cross at breakout and blue dot at the retest, plus a vertical measuring arrow to illustrate how the earlier base resolved. The current pattern, shaded across 2018–2025, repeats that choreography at a far larger scale. His sketch includes a time-and-price roadmap using twelve forward candles—two-week bars—implying a five- to six-month arc for the entire move if it were to echo the prior cycle. The first projected bar vaults XRP above $11. After three candles, the blue path tops out above $36, roughly six weeks into the run. Related Reading: XRP Price Could Explode To $3.8 Amid Trend Continuation The fourth candle traces a deep retracement back toward the $11 region, followed by a sharp recovery above $30 on the fifth. The next three candles stabilize around the $30 area before the path draws another slide to ~$11 and the onset of a cooling phase. The sequence is illustrative rather than prescriptive, but it visually anchors the extension math to possible market behavior. Whether XRP can follow the steep path sketched in blue is a separate question from whether the double-bottom has technically activated. Van Lagen’s chart answers the second with a yes: the breakout and retest sequence is complete. The first answer—delivery toward the ~$34 Fib extension—will be determined by how the next several two-week candles will look like. At press time, XRP traded at $3.14.

49968049,https://timestabloid.com/?p=77989,1754992843,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"This Hidden Gem Could 59x in ROI, With ETH Surging 20.9% to $4,220 as Backdrop",https://timestabloid.com/this-hidden-gem-could-59x-in-roi-with-eth-surging-20-9/,"Ethereum (ETH)’s impressive rally to $4,220, marking a 20.9% surge, has rekindled excitement across the crypto market, especially for projects that promise real utility combined with strong growth prospects. Among these, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a promising utility token, positioned to deliver an extraordinary 59x return on investment. Unlike many speculative tokens, MUTM is being built on a solid foundation, preparing for a beta launch that will bring to life its unique dual lending systems — Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). This tangible utility, alongside a Layer-2 network upgrade designed to drastically cut transaction costs and accelerate processing speeds, is setting the stage for lasting success. ETH Surging 20.9% Ethereum (ETH) soared 20.9% over the past week, reaching ~$4,220 on August 8, 2025, driven by record ETF inflows and whale accumulation, per CoinMarketCap data. Spot Ethereum (ETH) ETFs saw $533.8 million in net inflows on August 7, led by BlackRock’s ETHA ($426.22M), pushing total ETF assets to $10 billion, per SoSoValue. Whale purchases, including a $114 million buy by wallet 0xF436, and exchange outflows of 1M ETH tightened supply, per CryptoQuant. Technical indicators show ETH breaking $4,000 resistance, with RSI at 72 (overbought) and support at $3,820. The GENIUS Act’s regulatory clarity and anticipation for the Pectra upgrade (Q1 2026) fuel optimism. However, $2.2 billion in staking withdrawals and macro pressures like U.S. tariffs pose risks. A sustained move above $4,220 could target $4,500, but a drop below $3,820 risks $3,650. Real Utility and Strategic Growth Drive MUTM’s Value What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart is its comprehensive approach to decentralized finance. The platform’s dual lending system is designed to appeal to a broad spectrum of users. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model offers stability by enabling loans secured with high-quality collateral such as Ethereum (ETH), providing lenders with steady, reliable returns. Meanwhile, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending framework caters to more adventurous investors who engage in negotiated terms for higher risk, higher reward deals. This flexibility creates a vibrant, dynamic ecosystem that supports both conservative and speculative investment strategies. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is actively preparing for a Layer-2 integration, which will be a game changer for the platform. By significantly lowering transaction fees and boosting throughput, Layer-2 will make MUTM’s ecosystem accessible to more users, facilitating rapid adoption. Users will have the opportunity to stake mtTokens within designated smart contracts, earning MUTM rewards funded by the platform’s future revenue and buyback initiatives. These features are designed to build a sustainable demand for MUTM tokens, ensuring that users benefit from the platform’s growth and revenue generation. Currently in Phase 6 of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised approximately $14.3 million. The token is priced at $0.035, with 15% of the supply already sold to more than 15,100 enthusiastic holders. This strong presale performance reflects growing community trust and interest. The next presale phase will see a 15% price increase to $0.040, making now a critical window for investors to secure tokens at a discounted rate before the upward price adjustment. One of the most compelling reasons for confidence in MUTM is the project’s rigorous security and transparency, verified by a detailed CertiK audit. Achieving a high Token Scan Score of 95 and a Skynet Score of 78, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) demonstrates robust defenses against vulnerabilities, helping to build trust among investors and users alike. The project’s active social presence, with over 12,000 Twitter followers, further signals a vibrant, engaged community backing the platform’s mission. Early Investors Set to Reap Massive Rewards Consider the journey of an early investor who committed $50,000 during Phase 1 when MUTM tokens were priced at just $0.01. As the presale progresses into Phase 6 at $0.035, this investor’s holdings have already grown by 250%. Looking ahead, with a potential 59x return on investment, that initial $50,000 investment will transform into nearly $2.95 million, showcasing the extraordinary upside available to early backers. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not stopping there. The upcoming launch of its decentralized $1 stablecoin will further enhance the ecosystem’s utility, providing a trusted, collateral-backed currency that facilitates borrowing and lending with price stability. This development will be a major milestone, adding another layer of value to the platform and its token. Moreover, the MUTM ecosystem is designed to incentivize participation continuously. As users stake their mtTokens in smart contracts, they will receive MUTM rewards funded by future revenues and systematic token buybacks on the open market. These buybacks will reduce circulating supply over time, driving scarcity organically without relying on vague buzzwords. Such a demand mechanism is critical for sustained price appreciation. The team behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also aiming for listings on leading centralized exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, KuCoin, and Kraken. These high-profile listings will provide liquidity, increase visibility, and enable easier access for a broader audience of investors. When combined with the beta platform launch, this will mark a pivotal phase of adoption and growth. As Phase 6 nears a 15% sellout and the token price prepares to jump to $0.040 in the next phase, this is one of the final chances for investors to acquire MUTM at an attractive price point. The project’s transparent roadmap, backed by strong community support and rigorous security, makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a rare opportunity in today’s crypto landscape.

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis Even though Bitcoin ($BTC) gave back almost all the gains from yesterday morning’s rally by the close, it remains firmly in bullish territory. $BTC is now taking support on the same downward-sloping channel (shown by blue lines in the image below) it broke yesterday. This is a classic bullish setup where a former resistance level flips into support, often signaling that market sentiment has shifted in favor of buyers. Even better, the token also appears to be holding above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level and the 20-period exponential moving average (EMA) on the 4-hour chart – both indicators suggesting that $BTC has undergone an ideal pullback and is ready to resume its upward trend. And if we zoom out, the current price is also resting on an upward-sloping trendline (yellow line). This adds a strong layer of confluence to the bullish case and reinforces the idea that we’re likely in for a jump, not a decline.

Today’s Dogecoin Technical Analysis Dogecoin’s drop in the last few hours is, for all intents and purposes, a healthy correction, mainly because it now appears to be finding support at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, drawn from the 6-hour low of $0.19562. Interestingly, this same area (highlighted by the blue rectangle) also served as a key support zone in late July, when $DOGE bounced nearly 12% from it. A similar rally could be shaping up again, especially since the zone also aligns with the upper boundary of the Fibonacci range mentioned above. However, for that to play out, $DOGE must first deliver a strong breakout from the falling wedge pattern forming on the hourly chart. With the 200 EMA sitting just beneath as solid support, the odds of such a breakout look favorable. On the daily chart, $DOGE remains within a triangle pattern. While current momentum suggests a potential breakout to the upside, higher-timeframe resistances like this are always significant and shouldn’t be overlooked in any bullish scenario.

Market dynamics are witnessing what crypto expert Levi Rietveld describes as an amazing phenomenon, as Ethereum experiences a surge in liquidity. Rietveld notes that this influx often leads to wider ramifications, stating that “what happens very shortly thereafter is absolute pandemonium for the rest of the altcoin space.” XRP is also seeing increased activity from whales and other sources, and this liquidity injection into the altcoins highlights renewed investor confidence, driven by both market behavior and broader institutional interest. THE #XRP SEASON IS HERE!! pic.twitter.com/dtW8eilLqo — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) August 11, 2025 Ethereum’s Near-Term Outlook Rietveld shared a video from Tom Lee, Chairman at BitMine Immersion Technologies, which provided insights into Ethereum’s trajectory. According to Lee, Ethereum is undergoing a transformative period reminiscent of Bitcoin’s 2017 rise. He explained that Ethereum is now capturing Wall Street’s attention, which is contributing to its upward momentum. However, Lee emphasizes that short-term pricing does not always reflect Ethereum’s fair value. He pointed to recent market conditions, noting that the asset recently reached $3,300 because “there are folks who have liquidation levels, or they’re doing pair trades.” Despite these fluctuations, he is optimistic about Ethereum’s immediate prospects, suggesting it could reach $4,000 soon. Other experts have matched his bullish stance, with some setting targets as high as $6,400 . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Backing and the Broader Impact on XRP Wall Street’s increasing involvement with Ethereum could mark a turning point for the cryptocurrency. Lee suggested that Ethereum’s current narrative is stronger than it was in late 2021, when it reached $4,000. This renewed institutional backing may provide the foundation for sustained growth, not just for Ethereum but for the broader altcoin market. As Rietveld hinted, Ethereum’s rise often creates a ripple effect in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Veteran trader Peter Brandt recently confirmed that the alt season has begun , and increased liquidity and investor interest in Ethereum can lead to heightened activity across other altcoins, such as XRP, which have consistently outperformed ETH in 2025. The combination of growing liquidity for XRP, Ethereum’s potential to reach new price levels, and institutional interest positions the altcoin space for significant changes. While Ethereum’s near-term price predictions remain speculative, its improving narrative and market behavior suggest a pivotal moment is unfolding.

Key Takeaways: Texas’s utility regulator is suing the state attorney general to block the release of detailed crypto mining data. ERCOT estimates crypto mining already uses as much power as Austin, with far more capacity planned. Lawmakers mandated large mines to register, but the public still lacks access to the filings. The lawsuit, filed in June, challenges a ruling from Paxton’s office that would have required the PUC to release information to reporters from Straight Arrow News and The Texas Tribune . The journalists had requested details from registration filings under Senate Bill 1929, including facility names, locations, ownership, and power usage. Texas Crypto Mining Boom Grows, but True Scale Remains Opaque Texas has emerged as one of the largest cryptocurrency mining hubs in the United States, but the full scale of its operations remains opaque. In 2024, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) estimated that crypto mining could already account for around 2,600 megawatts of power demand, roughly equal to the city of Austin’s electricity use on a hot summer day. Additional projects are on the way: utility giant AEP recently disclosed that cryptocurrency mines with a combined load of 5,000 megawatts are planned in its Texas service area alone. The state’s electricity demand is projected to nearly double by 2030, with Bitcoin mining a major driver. While lawmakers passed SB 1929 in 2023 to require large-scale crypto mines, those consuming more than 75 megawatts, to register with the PUC by February 2025, the public has yet to see the detailed information those registrations contain. After the PUC denied the media requests earlier this year, the journalists appealed to Paxton’s office, which in May largely sided with them. Amusing to watch people explaining why Texas power prices have stayed low, by drawing charts and inferences that don't mention Texas has 3.5 GW of Bitcoin mining which Brad Jones (Texas Grid's former CEO) said back in 2022 is what ""keeps electricity prices low for all Texans"" pic.twitter.com/ra586mBtGO — Daniel Batten (@DSBatten) June 25, 2025 However, the commission, whose members are appointed by Gov. Greg Abbott, is now seeking a court order to keep the information sealed. “In the wrong hands, this information could be used by terrorists to plan attacks on Texas’s energy grid and critical infrastructure,” PUC lawyers wrote in a June 27 filing. Chinese Roots Still Dominate Global Bitcoin Mining As reported, over half of the world’s Bitcoin mining operations still trace their origins to China , with 55% to 65% of mining linked to Chinese capital, hardware, or expertise, according to Uminers CEO Batyr Hydyrov. Despite China’s 2021 mining ban, key Chinese players have maintained influence by relocating operations overseas. Major Chinese manufacturers Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT, responsible for 99% of Bitcoin mining hardware, have shifted production to the U.S. to avoid tariffs, helping boost America’s share of Bitcoin’s total hashrate from 4% in 2019 to 38% today. Hydyrov added that former Chinese miners have often increased capacity after moving abroad, with some expanding by up to 150%, and noted that limited mining still persists within China’s remote regions where enforcement is lax. Meanwhile, in Iran, officials have raised concerns over the rising strain crypto mining is placing on the nation’s electricity grid, claiming that the activity now contributes to as much as 20% of the country’s energy imbalance.

The payments giant has surpassed $200 million in cumulative stablecoin settlement volume while positioning itself as a bridge between traditional finance and digital assets rather than viewing stablecoins as a threat to its core business. According to a Bloomberg report , Sheffield’s team has expanded Visa’s stablecoin settlement business, partnered with major banks on token issuance, and inked deals with fintech firms globally. The company launched its Visa Tokenized Asset Platform in 2024, enabling financial institutions to issue and manage tokens on blockchain networks, with Spanish bank BBVA planning a stablecoin launch on Ethereum. Payment Giants Race to Capture Growing Stablecoin Market The stablecoin sector achieved another milestone in July with total market capitalization reaching $261 billion , extending twenty-two consecutive months of growth. However, as of Aug 12, the stablecoin total market cap has grown to $271B with over $2.6B added in the past week alone, according to data from DefiLlama . Source: DefiLlama Tether maintains leadership with $164 billion market cap, while USD Coin reached $63.6 billion, and Ethena USDe posted a remarkable 43.5% growth to $7.60 billion. Source: Coindesk Research The GENIUS Act’s passage in July established federal regulations for payment stablecoins, mandating full 1:1 backing by cash or liquid US Treasuries with monthly reserve disclosures. The legislation sparked corporate interest, with Western Union , Interactive Brokers , and Remitly exploring stablecoin integration for payment modernization. Notably, Visa has partnered with Yellow Card Financial to bring stablecoin payments across 20 African countries, while Circle partnered with Onafriq, Africa’s largest payments network spanning 500 wallets and 200 million bank accounts. Over 80% of intra-African transactions currently route through overseas correspondent banks, generating $5 billion in annual fees. Similarly, Mastercard announced a partnership with Chainlink , allowing over 3 billion cardholders to purchase crypto directly on-chain through secure fiat-to-crypto conversion. The collaboration leverages Chainlink’s interoperability infrastructure and Mastercard’s global payments network to power the Swapper Finance platform. Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser has also revealed the bank is considering launching its own stablecoin as part of a broader tokenized finance push. The bank projects stablecoin market capitalization could rise from $260 billion today to over $2 trillion by 2030, with base-case scenarios hitting $1.6 trillion. Traditional Finance Embraces Blockchain Infrastructure Revolution The growing stablecoin market has been drawing many traditional payment and fintech giants to find their feet in the market and bring crypto adoption to millions globally. Just today, a report covered by Cryptnew reveals Stripe’s “Tempo,” a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain focused on payments. Payment giant Stripe is building 'Tempo' blockchain with crypto VC Paradigm targeting Fortune 500 companies following $1.1B Bridge acquisition and Privy purchase. #Stripe #Blockchain https://t.co/GdVktNhRoy — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 12, 2025 This development would represent the most ambitious crypto initiative from traditional payment processors if implemented. The Ethereum-compatible blockchain, which is speculated to be built in partnership with Paradigm, would control server layers processing stablecoin transactions. The $92 billion company has executed a methodical acquisition strategy, purchasing stablecoin infrastructure firm Bridge for $1.1 billion and crypto wallet developer Privy . Stripe has launched stablecoin payments across 70 countries and introduced Stablecoin Financial Accounts, enabling companies in 101 countries to hold and transact digital dollars. Notably, MetaMask is also planning to launch “MetaMask USD” through a partnership with Stripe’s payment infrastructure, leveraging its 30 million monthly active users to challenge USDC dominance. The proposal outlines building the stablecoin with Stripe, providing regulatory clarity and fiat backing. Despite growth momentum, JPMorgan cast doubt on bullish projections , predicting stablecoins will only reach $500 billion by 2028. The bank pointed to weak mainstream adoption and limited use beyond crypto trading, estimating just 6% of stablecoin demand comes from actual payment activity. However, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller acknowledged that 99% of stablecoin market capitalization links to the US dollar, believing “ stablecoins can keep the dollar the world’s reserve currency ” by increasing global accessibility. Currently, over 20 million addresses now transact stablecoins on public blockchains as adoption accelerates across major sectors.

Following a brief stretch well above $121K yesterday, the world’s largest token has come back down to Earth, currently trading around $118K. Overall, momentum for Bitcoin (and the broader crypto market, nearing a $4T total market cap ) remains bullish. But what if there’s something even bigger than Bitcoin on the horizon? That’s the setting for the unveiling of Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a Layer‑2 solution aiming to propel Bitcoin well beyond its current limitations. This project’s success would reinforce Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto ecosystem, while setting up $HYPER for unprecedented success. The Problem: Scalability, Speed, and Functional Limitations Holding Bitcoin Back No one doubts Bitcoin’s resilience and function as a store of value. That said, there are a few things holding Bitcoin back. Because it was the first blockchain and the OG crypto, some of the innovations that power later chains like Ethereum and Solana simply weren’t present when Bitcoin launched. Low Throughput : Bitcoin processes around seven transactions per second (TPS), which pales in comparison to networks like Solana, capable of executing thousands of TPS in real time. High Costs & Delays : During periods of heavy network congestion, fees can surge dramatically and confirmation times may stretch to 30 minutes or more. That makes micro‑transactions or retail payments cost prohibitive. Limited Programmability : Bitcoin lacks native smart contract and DeFi support, closing off innovations such as decentralized finance, token minting, and automated applications. Without these capabilities, Bitcoin remains less competitive for everyday transactions or cutting-edge blockchain applications, even as rival platforms build vibrant ecosystems. These structural problems remain for Bitcoin no matter how big its market cap gets. Fundamentally, Bitcoin could become the biggest, best asset in the entire world – and it would still be difficult to build good dApps on it. Structurally, there are at least two reasons for Bitcoin’s limits– The first one is its limited smart-contract functionality. dApps require complex smart contracts to execute, but Bitcoin’s Layer-1 supports only simple smart contracts. Secondly, the network has limited programmability. Why only simple smart contracts? Because of the limited programmability of Bitcoin’s scripting language. That weakness does reduce programming errors and reduce the risk of denial of service attacks , but it hinders development. So how do you keep everything that makes Bitcoin great, but also push the ecosystem to the next level? By building something beyond the original Bitcoin layer. The Solution: Bitcoin Hyper’s Layer-2 Reinvention Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) introduces an innovative Layer‑2 protocol. The goal is to transform Bitcoin into a fast and scalable platform, where transactions are cheap and resolve quickly. How to pull that off? Bitcoin Hyper leverages the high-performance Solana Virtual Machine . This SVM integration enables rapid transaction processing, low costs, and near-instant finality – all while anchoring security to Bitcoin’s mainnet. Key features include: A Canonical Bridge Mechanism : Users deposit $BTC into a trustless Canonical Bridge, which locks $BTC on the Layer‑1 chain and mints equivalent wrapped $BTC on the Layer‑2. The Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) : Think of the SVM as a smart contract execution hub, based on the Solana blockchain. Smart contracts deployed here benefit from Solana’s higher transaction speeds and smart contracts. Bitcoin Hyper: Hybrid Modular Architecture Bitcoin Hyper tackles the scalability issue by separating the two key aspects of the blockchain’s function – smart contracts and final settlement. Smart contracts execute through the SVM. That allows transactions to benefit from the Solana-like speed and scalability. It also enables complex smart contracts, which in turn power DeFi, token issuance, micro-payments, and more – all with ultra-low gas fees and fast confirmation. Final settlement and security rely on Bitcoin’s Layer-1, taking advantage of the reliability and stability of the Bitcoin network. By separating the actions of the two layers into a modular architecture, the Bitcoin Hyper project takes the best aspects of both worlds. $HYPER: Native Token + Wrapped Bitcoin on the Bitcoin Hyper Layer-2 What about the tokens? When Bitcoin is deposited into the canonical bridge, it emerges on the other end as a wrapped Bitcoin on the Hyper Layer-2. There, powered by the SVM, it becomes eligible for native on-chain staking, DeFi deployment, and all the other tools of the growing crypto economy. Want to move your $BTC back to the Layer-1? Simply reverse the process. But that’s not the only token on the Bitcoin Hyper Layer-2. There’s also the project’s native $HYPER, currently available as an ERC-20 token in the ongoing presale . What is $HYPER? It’s the Bitcoin Hyper utility token, and holding $HYPER unlocks its own benefits: Transaction Payments : Pay gas fees with $HYPER for transfers, smart contract execution, and dApp interactions. Staking Access : During the presale, stake $HYPER to earn rewards (currently 126% APY). Ecosystem Access : Use $HYPER for early access to potential dApps, DeFi protocols, or premium services. Developer Grants : Bitcoin Hyper builders can receive discounts by holding and using $HYPER in smart contracts. The Bitcoin Hyper presale rocketed off to a strong start, raising millions in mere weeks. To date, $8.6M+ has been raised, and our $HYPER price prediction shows the token price could reach $0.32 by 2025 EOY (from its current price of $0.01265). Visit the Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) presale to learn more. The Use Cases: Real-World Examples Imagine purchasing a coffee with wrapped $BTC or $HYPER for minimal fees, or developers launching DeFi protocols and meme coins directly on a Bitcoin-centric network. Entire applications – from yield farming to NFT marketplaces – are now feasible within Bitcoin’s ecosystem. The potential implications for Bitcoin and Bitcoin Hyper are staggering. For the first time, Bitcoin could become a programmable network. By unlocking complex smart contracts and DeFi on the top blockchain asset, Bitcoin Hyper could attract developers and capital to the Bitcoin ecosystem. It could even change the narrative of $BTC as “digital gold.” And for Bitcoin Hyper, there’s a key first-mover advantage. As the fastest Bitcoin L2 and the first to deploy its unique modular architecture, Bitcoin Hyper may seize developer initiative and integration. There’s no doubt that a successful Layer-2 would reinforce Bitcoin’s dominance. With enhanced utility, Bitcoin’s role could extend beyond a passive store-of-value to a dynamic foundation for innovation – accelerating further adoption, adding new utility for growing Bitcoin strategy reserves, and potentially challenging leaders like Ethereum in the DeFi space. Bitcoin Hyper has the power to not only scale Bitcoin, but also redefine what Bitcoin is capable of becoming. And you can still join the Bitcoin Hyper presale to support the project. Bitcoin + Layer-2: Whales Alerted to $HYPER’s Potential Bitcoin’s price uptick this week – around 4% – provides an energizing backdrop for the Bitcoin Hyper presale. It could explain why whale interest is growing, with a $12,079 $HYPER purchase recently rolling in. By addressing Bitcoin’s long-standing pain points with a scalable, smart contract-capable Layer-2, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is poised to amplify Bitcoin’s utility and reignite ecosystem growth. As always, though, be sure to do your own research before making any investment.

Full refunds required for fraud victims who report within 30 days. Wisconsin hosts 582 Bitcoin ATMs; fraud complaints surged 99% in 2024. On August 11, 2025, Wisconsin Democrats filed their second bill in two weeks (Senate Bill 386) aimed at tightening regulations on cryptocurrency ATMs amid rising fraud. Senate Bill 386, introduced by Sen. Kelda Royce and six colleagues, duplicates Assembly Bill 384, filed July 31 by Representative Ryan Spode and 10 other co-sponsors. Both bills provide a single regulatory framework and include: Mandatory payment transmitter license for operators; Strict identity verification and collection of personal data (name, date of birth, address, telephone number, identity document); Transaction limits up to $1,000 per day per client; Commission cap at $5 or 3% of the transaction amount (whichever is greater); Mandatory fraud warnings on every crypto ATM; A policy of providing full refunds to victims of fraud if they report the incident to the operator and law enforcement within 30 days. The initiative follows an urgent warning from the US Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) about a 99% increase in complaints regarding cryptocurrency ATM fraud in 2024, with victims losing nearly $247 million. “While crypto ATMs were initially a natural extension of the digital asset ecosystem, a convenient way to purchase through physical terminals, the lack of proper KYC procedures made them vulnerable to money laundering and illegal activities,” said Arjun Vijay, founder of Giottus exchange. According to Coin ATM Radar, Wisconsin is home to 582 Bitcoin ATMs out of 31,439 operating nationwide. State Democrats noted that limiting anonymity could reduce large transactions but, at the same time, “increases public confidence and creates the preconditions for safer use of digital currencies in everyday transactions,” said Dilip Kumar HV, director of the Digital South Trust.

This Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin mining company has made headlines with its significant Bitfarms BTC sales during the second quarter, demonstrating a strategic approach to managing its digital assets and boosting its financial standing. Bitfarms, a prominent player in the digital asset space, successfully sold 1,052 BTC in Q2. These strategic sales occurred at an impressive average price of $95,500 per Bitcoin. This move generated a substantial $100 million in revenue for the company, underscoring the effectiveness of their Bitcoin miner strategy . How Did Bitfarms BTC Sales Shape Their Q2 Performance? Beyond the impressive sales figures, Bitfarms’ Bitfarms Q2 performance reveals a robust financial picture. As of August 11, the company maintained a strong holding of 1,402 BTC.

It is designed to expand public-private collaboration to combat illicit activities on the blockchain. Binance has joined as the program’s first official member. In parallel, Justin Sun, Founder of TRON, announced a significant milestone: since launching less than a year ago, T3 FCU has frozen over $250 million USD in illicit assets globally, including almost $6M frozen in a successful coordinated first effort with Binance via T3+ to thwart the proceeds of a pig butchering scam. Since its inception in September 2024, T3 FCU has worked closely with law enforcement agencies worldwide to identify and disrupt criminal networks. The unit has analyzed millions of transactions across five continents, monitoring over $3 billion USD in total volume. This comprehensive monitoring capability enables T3 FCU to work across borders, identifying and disrupting criminal operations in real-time, making it an invaluable resource for law enforcement agencies worldwide. Through T3+, the T3 FCU will work more closely with exchanges, financial institutions, and other stakeholders to improve monitoring capabilities, speed communications and collaboration, and multiply the ability to address illicit activity more effectively across the entire blockchain industry. “Freezing over $250 million in illicit assets in less than a year is a powerful testament to what’s possible when the industry comes together with a shared goal,” said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether. “At Tether, we’ve always believed that bad actors have nowhere to hide on the blockchain — and we’ve consistently backed that belief with action, working closely with global law enforcement agencies to monitor transactions and disrupt criminal activity. With the launch of T3+, we’re proud to help scale that collaboration across the entire ecosystem. It’s only through collective effort that we can build a safer, more trusted environment for users worldwide.” “With the launch of T3+, we’re expanding the scope of collaboration across the blockchain industry to better address illicit activity in real time,” said Sun. “Freezing over $250 million in criminal assets in under a year is a clear demonstration of what’s possible when the public and private sectors work together. Our goal is to make crypto safe and trusted for users worldwide.” “Surpassing $250 million in frozen illicit assets represents more than just a milestone – it reaffirms T3 FCU’s expanding impact in disrupting illicit finance worldwide. Through close collaboration with law enforcement across jurisdictions, we’re validating T3 FCU’s ability to scale and demonstrating the potential for novel public-private partnerships,” said Chris Janczewski, Head of Global Investigations at TRM Labs. “At Binance, we are committed to fostering a maturing crypto ecosystem where innovation, regulation, and security work hand in hand. Joining the T3+ initiative reflects our dedication to proactive collaboration with industry partners and law enforcement to combat illicit activity in real time,” shared Nils Andersen-Röed, Global Head of the Financial Intelligence Unit at Binance. “Collaboration is essential to ensuring blockchain’s long-term success and credibility, and we’re proud to support initiatives like T3 FCU that help ensure the safety and integrity of blockchain networks and crypto assets.” T3 FCU has collaborated closely with law enforcement agencies around the world to assist in investigations involving money laundering, investment fraud, extortion schemes, terrorism financing, and other serious financial crimes. Binance’s inclusion in the T3+ program represents a practical step toward strengthening compliance standards and addressing illicit finance risks within the digital asset ecosystem with an emphasis on real time collaboration. As regulatory frameworks around blockchain technology continue to develop, initiatives like T3+ offer a model for how public-private actors can proactively work with one another and with law enforcement. Through this program, T3 FCU is building the infrastructure needed for more effective transaction monitoring, timely intervention, and alignment with global financial crime prevention efforts.

Ethereum users bristled, arguing the comparison was a category error between an open, permissionless blockchain and a closed, centralized exchange network. The sharpest rebuttal came from the pseudonymous researcher polynya (@apolynya), who has 94,000 followers on X. When they say the future of markets runs at 22 TPS but NASDAQ handles 2k trades per second pic.twitter.com/TAsGAcFc7k — Solana (@solana) August 9, 2025 Solana Vs. Ethereum In a detailed post , polynya argued that the technical baselines underlying US equities infrastructure dwarf anything a minimally decentralized layer-1 can achieve under global consensus. “Nasdaq’s SIP is designed to handle 10 million operations per second, with a latency of 0.02 milliseconds (though realistically, constrained by speed of light, it still gets to 0.2 ms between NYSE or Cboe and Nasdaq ), and is readily parallelisable for infinite throughput. (There are three SIPs operating currently.),” polynya wrote. From that premise, the conclusion was blunt: “Given the crippling limitation of achieving strict global consensus, Nasdaq will forever be thousands of times faster and cheaper than any minimally decentralised L1 blockchain, short of exotic new physics that does not yet exist.” Polynya added that if blockchains want to approach real-time markets, they must lean on succinct cryptography rather than raw TPS. “The only known method to get anywhere close is by using ZK proofs instead for real-time execution and deferring & speeding up strict global consensus by orders of magnitude (as you only need to achieve consensus on a succinct proof instead of millions of transactions), and even then, it’ll cost orders of magnitude more, will take years to mature, and it’s not an appropriate use of this tech as Nasdaq does not require strict global consensus anyway.” The post ended with an indictment of the metric itself: “Totally wild that cryptobros are still coping about ‘TPS’ like it’s 2017 instead of building applications that make people’s lives better. (Degenerate gambling does not.)”Solana Labs founder Anatoly Yakovenko (@aeyakovenko) pushed back on both the framing and the cryptographic remedy. He first contended that “Zk proofs are always slower than classical execution.” Expanding on that, Yakovenko argued the equities-style comparison—if one is to be made—should be about intake guarantees and scheduling rather than block TPS or consensus latency. “Nasdaq requires that every message is included, and that all messages are treated the same,” he wrote, before pointing to how priority fees alter inclusion on blockchains: “The way that priority fees work is that any txs with a priority fee lower than the floor inclusion price in the block doesn’t get included. So the comparison to Nasdaq that matters is scheduler throughput and latency, not block tps or consensus latency. You can have 10 second blocks with 1000 tps, and a scheduler on the block producer that can reliably tell the trader that their tx is included in microseconds.” From an economic perspective, Yakovenko suggested Solana’s design already drives the cost of marginal drops toward irrelevance. “If the floor priority fee is The Misconception About ZK Proofs He later returned to the ZK debate to stress where proofs do and do not help. “I don’t understand where people get this misconception that ZK proofs are faster or can somehow make a system faster. It’s completely wrong. They can lower some of the costs for replication, but they can’t improve performance if replication cost isn’t a blocker.” Yakovenko illustrated the point with a bandwidth-versus-execution thought experiment: “Let’s assume that zk proofs are completely free and instant. If sizeof(tx) His bottom line targeted Ethereum’s cost model: “So the only place where zk proofs actually help is if replication is expensive. Where is replication insanely expensive? On ethereum L1. It’s cheaper to post a state root and a zk proof so the L1 can skip executing all the state.” Solana community developer João Mendonça (@joaomendoncaaaa) argued that Solana’s ambition is not to equal Nasdaq’s raw speed. “the point of solana as a replacement for nasdaq is not to be as fast as nasdaq itself,” he wrote, but to offer similar execution prices “with 1000x the accessibility, worldwide, [without] asking for permission, 24/7, with uncensorable asset ownership and portability throughout all of defi.” At press time, SOL traded at $174.34.",Crypto News|crypto|crypto news|Ethereum|SOL|SOL news|SOL price|solana|Solana news|Solana price,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|ETH|MARKET|ZK,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-12 12:00:01

The company also said it is developing a layer-1 blockchain “designed to provide an enterprise-grade foundation for stablecoin payments, FX, and capital markets applications.” A public testnet for the Arc blockchain is scheduled to live in the next few months. Arc is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible and uses USDC as its native gas token, has an integrated stablecoin FX engine, and sub-second settlement finality along with “opt-in privacy controls,” the company said. Circle’s is not the first stablecoin-focused blockchain on the blocks.

The repo trade, carried out on Tradeweb, settled atomically on a Saturday, sidestepping the weekday-only limitations of traditional settlement systems, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk on Tuesday. Prime brokers converted U.S. Treasuries held at the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) into tokenized assets on Canton, then used them as collateral for USDC-backed financing. The Canton Network is a privacy-focused blockchain developed by Digital Asset. Institutions involved in the transaction include Bank of America (BAC), Circle (CRCL), Citadel, Cumberland DRW, DTCC, Hidden Road, Societe Generale, Virtu Financial and Tradeweb. Most of these firms invested in Digital Asset in its $135 million fundraising round in June. Tokenization of government debt, a crucial collateral asset in global markets, is part of a broader push to bring financial instruments, or real-world assets, onto blockchains. Global banks and asset managers explore tokenization to cut settlement times, increase transparency and keep markets open around the clock. Participants in the Canton transaction said it marks a step toward a unified market structure blending traditional finance’s scale with the programmability of decentralized blockchain rails. They plan more transactions later this year. ""[The transaction] demonstrates how market participants can unlock real-time collateral mobility and round-the-clock financing using assets on chain, which lays the groundwork for a fundamentally more efficient and accessible global financial system,"" Kelly Mathieson, chief business development officer at Digital Asset, said in a statement.

Its presale has now raised over $5.89 million in total. Stage 17 is priced at $0.00998, while the fixed launch price is set at $0.3517, giving early buyers around 3,425% ROI potential. Cold Wallet ($CWT) also includes a rewards structure and tiered cashback that increases with holdings, adding long-term earning potential. Meanwhile, Polkadot (DOT) holds key support at $3.55, aiming for $5-plus by 2025 on the back of growing on-chain activity. Shiba Inu (SHIB) trades near resistance, supported by strong community engagement and updates to Shibarium and ShibaSwap. These developments position all three projects for notable attention in 2025, blending active usage, technical progress, and growth potential in the evolving crypto market. Polkadot Price Forecast: Long-Term Upside Remains Polkadot (DOT) is trading at around $3.59, down 1.8% over the past 24 hours. Key support lies at $3.55, while resistance is holding at $3.67. Price trends show a short-term bearish pattern with lower highs, yet the long-term outlook remains positive. Forecasts suggest DOT could average $4.90 and reach $5.30 by 2025. In October 2024, the network processed 32 million validated transactions, alongside steady wallet growth. Looking ahead, price projections indicate possible highs of $17.62 in 2028 and $55.70 by 2031. Polkadot’s multichain structure and upgrades, including the Sinai Update, support its steady progress. While near-term trading may remain under pressure, growing utility and consistent development give it a strong case for sustained growth. Shiba Inu Price Outlook: Breakout Potential for 2025 Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently testing resistance at $0.00001242, with support close at $0.00001213. The price has been moving in a tight range between these levels, signaling the possibility of a breakout. On August 4, 2025, SHIB traded at $0.00001223, marking a 0.2% daily increase. While still far from its all-time high, SHIB remains notable for its historic rise from record lows. Current forecasts point to $0.000022 in 2025 and $0.000070 by 2028. Longer-term predictions for 2031 see an average value of $0.000186. Growth in the Shibarium and ShibaSwap platforms continues to strengthen the project’s long-term prospects. Combined with strong community engagement, these developments could help SHIB maintain upward momentum in the years ahead. Cold Wallet’s Referral Model Creates Lasting Value Cold Wallet is building momentum with features that serve real users. Its referral program gives instant USDT cashback on swap transactions, removing delays and making rewards simple to claim. The presale has reached Stage 17, raising over $5.89 million. With CWT priced at $0.00998 and a fixed launch price of $0.3517, early participants see a potential ROI of about 3,425%. The referral model works on a dual-reward basis. Referrers receive a 10% CWT bonus, while referred users get 5%. These bonuses come from a dedicated referral pool, so the main supply stays intact. All bonuses follow a vesting schedule: 10% unlocks at the Token Generation Event, and the remaining 90% is released over three months. Cold Wallet’s tiered cashback system boosts rewards based on holdings. Bronze tier offers 10% gas cashback, while Diamond tier provides 100% gas plus 50% swap and ramp cashback. Even bonus tokens from referrals can increase a user’s tier, creating more earning potential over time. With a low entry price, high upside, and a working cashback model, Cold Wallet is more than a presale. It combines measurable value, reward incentives, and growth potential, making it one of the standout crypto projects to watch in 2025. Building for Sustained Growth Polkadot is continuing to advance its multichain ecosystem, maintaining optimistic long-term price projections despite current volatility. Shiba Inu is holding strong above support levels, supported by development progress and community backing. Cold Wallet distinguishes itself by pairing an active product with a clear reward model. With Stage 17 pricing at $0.00998, a $0.3517 launch price, and 3,425% ROI potential, it offers both functional benefits and a rare entry point. For those tracking the market in 2025, its combination of measurable usage, growth incentives, and pricing advantage makes it a notable project to follow closely.

This bold strategic decision, predicated on the anticipation of a Fed pivot , holds profound implications not just for traditional currency traders but also for cryptocurrency investors who closely monitor macro-economic shifts. Understanding this stance is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the evolving financial landscape. Unpacking BofA’s Bold Move: Why Go Long EUR/USD Forecast ? When a major financial institution like Bank of America announces it’s ‘going long’ on a currency pair like EUR/USD, it means they are betting on the Euro strengthening against the US Dollar. Essentially, they are buying Euros and selling Dollars, expecting the exchange rate to rise. This isn’t just a casual trade; it’s a strategic position based on extensive analysis of economic indicators, central bank intentions, and global liquidity flows. BofA’s conviction stems from a belief that the underlying economic conditions and monetary policy trajectories of the Eurozone and the United States are set to diverge in a way that favors the Euro. This outlook is deeply intertwined with their view on the Federal Reserve’s future actions. The Anticipated Fed Pivot : A Game-Changer for the Dollar? The term ‘Fed pivot’ refers to a significant shift in the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance, typically from a hawkish (tightening) to a dovish (easing) approach. For years, the Fed has been on an aggressive rate-hiking cycle to combat inflation. However, as inflation shows signs of cooling and economic growth concerns emerge, market participants, including BofA, are increasingly expecting the Fed to pause or even begin cutting interest rates in the near future. This is the anticipated pivot. Why is this considered a game-changer? A pivot towards lower interest rates or a less restrictive monetary policy directly impacts the attractiveness of the US Dollar. Here’s why: Reduced Yield Advantage: Higher interest rates make a currency more appealing to investors seeking better returns on their fixed-income investments. If the Fed cuts rates while other central banks maintain or even hike theirs, the dollar’s yield advantage diminishes. Increased Liquidity: A dovish Fed might also signal an increase in the money supply, which can dilute the dollar’s value. Risk-On Sentiment: Lower interest rates generally encourage investors to seek higher-yielding, riskier assets, potentially diverting capital away from safe-haven currencies like the dollar. This expected shift creates a significant ‘headwind’ for the dollar, meaning factors are aligning to push its value lower against other major currencies. Understanding Dollar Weakness : What Drives It? The concept of dollar weakness is not merely about a single event like a Fed pivot, but rather a confluence of factors that erode the dollar’s purchasing power and international appeal. While a Fed pivot is a primary catalyst, other elements contribute to this potential decline: Interest Rate Differentials: As mentioned, if the European Central Bank (ECB) maintains higher rates or is perceived to be more hawkish than the Fed, the Euro becomes more attractive for carry trades. Economic Outlook: A strengthening Eurozone economy relative to the US could also bolster the Euro. If European growth prospects improve, foreign investment may flow into the region, increasing demand for the Euro. Global Risk Appetite: During periods of high global risk appetite, investors tend to move away from safe-haven assets like the dollar and into growth-oriented currencies or commodities. Fiscal Health: Concerns over US national debt or fiscal policy could also contribute to long-term dollar depreciation, though this is usually a slower-moving factor. BofA’s long EUR/USD position suggests they believe these factors are aligning to create a sustained period of dollar depreciation, making the Euro a preferred currency for investment. Crafting Your Forex Trading Strategy Amidst Macro Shifts For forex traders, BofA’s call serves as a powerful signal, but it’s crucial to develop an independent and robust forex trading strategy . While institutional insights are valuable, market timing and risk management remain paramount. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Central Bank Communication: Pay close attention to speeches, meeting minutes, and economic projections from both the Fed and the ECB. Any deviation from expected dovishness or hawkishness can quickly reverse market sentiment. Analyze Economic Data: Key economic indicators like inflation rates, GDP growth, employment figures, and retail sales for both the US and Eurozone provide insights into the health of their respective economies and influence central bank decisions. Understand Correlation: Recognize how dollar movements impact other asset classes. A weaker dollar often correlates with stronger commodity prices (as commodities are dollar-denominated) and can also provide a tailwind for cryptocurrencies. Risk Management: Utilize stop-loss orders, manage position sizes, and avoid over-leveraging. Even strong forecasts can be undone by unexpected market events. Diversification: Consider diversifying your portfolio beyond just forex, exploring how a weaker dollar might benefit other investments you hold or are considering. Navigating these macro shifts requires a blend of fundamental analysis and disciplined execution. Central Bank Policy Divergence: The Heart of Currency Volatility The core of the EUR/USD dynamic often lies in the divergent paths of central bank policy . While the Fed is expected to pivot towards easing, the ECB’s stance might be different. The Eurozone has faced its own set of inflationary pressures and economic challenges, and the ECB’s response could vary. Consider this simplified comparison of potential policy trajectories: Central Bank Current Stance (General) Anticipated Near-Term Path (BofA’s View) Potential Impact on Currency Federal Reserve (Fed) Restrictive (High rates) Pivot to easing (Rate cuts/pause) Dollar Weakness European Central Bank (ECB) Restrictive (High rates) Maintain or slower easing Euro Strength This divergence in policy expectations is what fuels the conviction behind going long EUR/USD. If the Fed becomes more dovish while the ECB remains relatively hawkish, the interest rate differential would narrow or even reverse in favor of the Euro, making it more attractive to hold. Beyond Forex: Ripple Effects on Crypto and Other Assets The implications of a weaker dollar extend far beyond the traditional forex market. For the crypto community, this is particularly relevant. Cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, are often seen as alternative stores of value or ‘digital gold’ and can exhibit an inverse correlation with the US Dollar. Crypto as a Dollar Hedge: When the dollar weakens, investors may seek alternative assets to preserve wealth, potentially driving demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Increased Liquidity: A more dovish Fed policy often leads to increased global liquidity, which can flow into riskier assets, including crypto. Commodity Boost: Dollar weakness typically supports commodity prices (like gold and oil), as they become cheaper for holders of other currencies. This can signal broader inflationary pressures or a shift in global capital flows. Equity Markets: While complex, a weaker dollar can sometimes benefit US multinational corporations (making their exports cheaper) and can signal a ‘risk-on’ environment generally supportive of equity markets. Understanding these interconnected dynamics is vital for making informed investment decisions across different asset classes. Conclusion: A Compelling Shift on the Horizon Bank of America’s strategic move to go long EUR/USD, driven by the compelling expectation of a Fed pivot , signals a potentially significant shift in global currency dynamics. This anticipated policy change from the Federal Reserve is seen as a major headwind for the US Dollar, paving the way for potential dollar weakness and Euro strength. For investors, this outlook necessitates a careful review of their portfolios, potentially adjusting their forex trading strategy and considering the broader implications for assets ranging from commodities to cryptocurrencies. The divergence in central bank policy remains a key driver of market volatility, offering both challenges and opportunities for those who are prepared.

49973103,https://timestabloid.com/?p=78062,1755000352,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Is More Bullish on XRP Than Ever. Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-is-more-bullish-on-xrp-than-ever-heres-why/,"In a recent post, industry commentator Jake Claver declares, “I’m more bullish than ever on XRP.” He points to new projects on the XRP Ledger and Ripple’s payments software now reaching users across “80% of global trade corridors.” Claver’s confidence may resonate widely, but it’s important to ground such optimism in verifiable milestones and emerging developments. Protocol Advancement: Real Enhancements Powering Utility In June 2025, RippleX launched version 2.5.0 of rippled — the flagship implementation of the XRP Ledger protocol. This comprehensive upgrade introduces TokenEscrow, enabling escrows for IOUs and multi-purpose tokens; Batch transactions for atomic grouping; PermissionedDEX for regulated asset markets; and Permission Delegation to support enterprise-grade account structure. It also includes critical fixes for NFTs and payment channels. The impact was quick and visible: network activity surged, with daily active addresses rising more than sevenfold even before the release. These upgrades signal that XRPL is actively evolving beyond a simple ledger into a flexible infrastructure for institutional applications. I’m more bullish than ever on #XRP New projects are launching on the #XRPL and @Ripple ’s payments software keeps expanding, now reaching new users in 80% of global trade corridors The network effect is only getting stronger — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) August 12, 2025 Developer & Ecosystem Growth: A Magnetic Pull for Innovation The enhanced ledger functionality is already catalyzing developer interest. With escrow tools, atomic multi-transactions, and compliant trading environments, projects across DeFi, tokenization, and real-world asset (RWA) markets now have a robust playground. The infrastructure improvements reinforce XRPL’s appeal to startups, financial institutions, and enterprise developers seeking both performance and compliance. Robust On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) Adoption: XRP in Motion Ripple’s payments suite—particularly On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), which uses XRP as a bridge asset—continues to gain traction in real-world remittance markets. As of mid-2025, ODL is live across corridors covering over 80% of global remittance markets. RippleNet’s ODL is actively reducing pre-funding needs by approximately 65%, lowering costs up to 0.3%, and enabling instant settlement across key corridors in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Further, more than 20 banks and payment providers are using ODL in production , and over 100 institutions have piloted the service, signaling meaningful institutional engagement. Balancing Optimism with Realism Despite the momentum, prudent observers note potential headwinds: competing stablecoin ecosystems and the need to sustain institutional liquidity remain real challenges. Nonetheless, the Trellis of strengthened protocol, growing developer activity, and expanding payment utilization substantiates Claver’s bullish outlook. Network Effects Gaining Strength When technical upgrades, rising developer interest, and actual payments adoption converge, they create the fertile ground for a self-reinforcing network effect. Jake Claver’s bullish stance is not speculative hyperbole, it’s a clear-eyed reflection of XRPL’s maturation. As the ledger continues to evolve, the onus is now on market watchers to track updates, partnerships, and corridor expansions closely in the coming months.

Tempo is compatible with Solidity and aims to boost crypto transaction control. Recent Stripe acquisitions Bridge and Privy enhance stablecoin and wallet services. Stripe is developing its own blockchain, Tempo, in partnership with venture capital firm Paradigm, Fortune reports. According to a job posting that was later removed, the new protocol will focus on processing payments and will be compatible with the Solidity programming language. According to available information, the project team consists of five people and is currently working in secrecy mode. Sources familiar with the plans say Tempo will be a layer-one blockchain rather than a layer on top of existing networks. Representatives for Stripe and Paradigm declined to comment. The launch of Tempo complements Stripe’s recent acquisitions in the crypto sector. In October 2024, the company acquired stablecoin infrastructure platform Bridge for $1.1 billion. In June 2025, it acquired crypto wallet developer Privy for an undisclosed amount. Experts note that the acquisition of Bridge allows Stripe to offer clients tools for integrating and issuing stablecoins, while the purchase of Privy gives it the ability to provide custodial solutions. The new blockchain will provide the company with control over the infrastructure that processes transactions. Stripe’s move comes as interest in stablecoins has grown following the passage of the GENIUS Act in the United States, which sets federal standards for the cryptocurrency industry. Stripe co-founder Patrick Collison has previously said that businesses are increasingly considering the asset class as a payment instrument due to the maturity of the technology. At the same time, Stripe has not yet disclosed whether it plans to issue its own token for Tempo. The company also has not explained the specific tasks the new protocol is intended to solve, but analysts believe it will strengthen Stripe’s position in the corporate crypto payments segment.",News|Blockchain,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-12 12:07:31

Ivancheglo framed the move as a stress test to help the Monero community prepare for future network threats, but the announcement has triggered sharp debate among developers and security experts. A 51% attack occurs when a single entity or coordinated group controls a majority of a proof-of-work network’s hashrate. Ethereum Classic suffered multiple reorganizations in 2020, resulting in millions of dollars in losses, while Bitcoin Gold faced similar assaults in 2018 and 2020. Smaller networks like Verge have also been targeted, demonstrating how concentrated hashing power can destabilize and entire cryptocurrency network. Monero, which uses the CPU-friendly RandomX algorithm, has long prided itself on resisting ASIC centralization. Qubic’s “useful proof-of-work” (uPoW) model repurposes Monero mining rewards by converting XMR into USDT, then using the proceeds to buy and burn QUBIC tokens, a deflationary mechanism that doubles as a liquidity sink for its own ecosystem. From mid-May to late July, Qubic’s share of the network jumped from less than 2% to over 25%, at times topping pool rankings. Ledger CTO Charles Guillemet warned on X that Monero “appears to be in the midst of a successful 51% attack,” citing signs of a major chain reorganization, with several other industry experts like SlowMist founder Yu Xian expressing their doubt over Qubic’s economics. Whether the events mark a hostile takeover or simply a stress test, XMR has responded negatively, dropping by 6.65% in the past 24 hours to compound a 16% decline over the past week.

The CYBER token recently experienced an astonishing 130% surge, captivating investors and analysts alike. This dramatic price action followed its much-anticipated Upbit listing , a significant event for any digital asset. However, the story doesn’t end there; a substantial Binance transfer involving millions of dollars worth of CYBER added another layer of intrigue to this remarkable market movement. What Sparked the CYBER Token’s Explosive Growth? The immediate catalyst for the CYBER token ‘s impressive jump from $1.88 to $4.34 was its official listing on Upbit. For those unfamiliar, Upbit is a major South Korean cryptocurrency exchange, known for its high trading volumes and significant influence on Asian crypto markets. A listing on such a prominent platform often introduces a token to a wider audience, leading to increased demand and, consequently, price appreciation. This “Upbit effect” is a well-documented phenomenon in the crypto market . When a popular exchange adds a new asset, it typically generates excitement and liquidity. The sudden availability of CYBER to Upbit’s extensive user base directly contributed to the rapid surge we observed. The Binance Transfer: A Closer Look at Blockchain Dynamics Adding a fascinating twist to the CYBER token ‘s story was the considerable transfer of 1.744 million CYBER, valued at $6.18 million, to Binance. This transaction originated from a multisignature wallet linked to BuildOnCyber, as reported by EmberCN on X. Such large-scale blockchain transfer events often draw attention because they can signal various intentions. For instance, a transfer to an exchange like Binance could indicate preparations for increased liquidity, potential selling pressure from early investors, or even strategic moves by the project team. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone monitoring the crypto market . Increased Liquidity: Large transfers to exchanges can provide more tokens for trading, potentially improving market depth. Potential Selling Pressure: Holders might transfer assets to exchanges to capitalize on price surges, leading to sell-offs. Strategic Movements: Projects sometimes move tokens for operational purposes, partnerships, or market-making activities. Why Does Web3 Gaming Matter for CYBER? While the immediate focus is on price action and transfers, it is important to remember that CYBER is deeply connected to the Web3 gaming ecosystem. CyberConnect, the project behind the CYBER token, aims to build a decentralized social graph protocol. This infrastructure is vital for the development of new, user-owned applications, including those within the burgeoning Web3 gaming space. The success of platforms supporting decentralized identity and social connections, like CyberConnect, is fundamental to the future of Web3 gaming . As this sector grows, so too might the utility and demand for tokens that power its underlying infrastructure, like CYBER. Navigating Volatility in the Crypto Market The recent events surrounding the CYBER token highlight the inherent volatility of the crypto market . While a 130% surge is undoubtedly exciting, it also underscores the rapid shifts that can occur. Investors and enthusiasts should always approach such movements with a balanced perspective. Key takeaways from this event include: Exchange listings can be powerful price catalysts. Large transfers warrant careful observation for market implications. Understanding a project’s fundamentals (like its role in Web3 gaming ) provides long-term context beyond short-term price swings. These insights are crucial for making informed decisions and understanding the broader landscape of digital assets and blockchain transfer activities. What’s Next for the CYBER Token and the Crypto Market? The CYBER token ‘s journey continues to unfold. While the initial surge driven by the Upbit listing and the notable Binance transfer has captured headlines, the long-term trajectory will depend on continued development, adoption within Web3 gaming , and overall crypto market sentiment. As always, staying informed and conducting thorough research remains paramount in this dynamic space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What caused the CYBER token’s recent price surge?

Five tokens grabbed attention with their rapid gains, setting themselves apart from the pack. Names like MYX and ZORA appeared alongside unexpected surges such as TROLL and SOON. What caused these price jumps, and what makes these tokens stand out now? The details may surprise even close watchers. $XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game. With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project. What sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth. Fueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price: $0.0001 Price Now: $0.005 Next Stage: $0.01 Final Presale Price: $0.02 Following the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries. So far, over $15 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch. Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! MYX: The Fast-Lane Token Powering Cross-Chain Perpetual Plays MYX sits at the heart of a new kind of trading spot. The coin fuels a cross-chain exchange that lets users bet on price moves without time limits. A smart system called the Matching Pool lines up orders, so trades fill at the price you see. No surprise slips. Up to 50× leverage is on offer with stable USDC as margin. The app lives at once on BNB Chain, Arbitrum, opBNB, and Linea, so funds fly where they are needed. Tens of millions already rest in its pools, and volume has crossed the billion mark. Recent cross-chain links lit a spark, sending active wallets and fees surging. In a market hunting for real use, that growth stands out. Many tokens tied to leverage trades, such as GMX or DYDX, have already made big moves this cycle. MYX is younger, still below them in value, yet its pool-to-peer design aims for the same clear fills with lighter costs. If TVL keeps climbing and new chains join, the token could gain fresh demand from both traders and reward seekers. As always, price swings will follow crypto mood, but the setup looks promising. SOON: The Fast Lane Token Riding the Solana Super Stack SOON powers the Super Adoption Stack, a set of rollups built on the Solana Virtual Machine. These rollups click together like blocks, moving data fast and across many chains. People use SOON to vote, stake, earn rewards, and pay fees. The initial stash sits near one billion tokens, and new coins grow at about three percent each year. Daily trading is brisk, and the cap already sits in the high nine-figure range. Backers have poured tens of millions into the stack, and timed unlocks keep fresh supply flowing. The pitch is simple: rollup speed with Solana tools and Ethereum-style reach. That blend could shine in a market hunting for cheap, fast lanes while Bitcoin cools and Layer-2s crowd. SOON’s clear use cases give it more purpose than many meme coins born this year. Still, the steady unlocks and three percent inflation mean price needs growing demand to climb. If the next cycle favors networks that link chains instead of sealing them off, SOON may stand out much like MATIC did in 2021 or OP in 2023. For traders who see cross-chain traffic as the next big wave, holding a slice of this stack looks worth a closer look. TROLL Coin: When Internet Mischief Meets Multi-Chain Mayhem TROLL started as a wink to every prank lover online. The coin has no promised use, yet it spreads across Ethereum, Solana, and other chains like a sly joke gone viral. Because its code is renounced, no one can secretly change the rules. Each chain shows its own price, swinging from a few million to almost two hundred million in value. Some weeks the chart leaps double digits in days, reminding fans why meme tokens keep stealing the spotlight. Many traders see TROLL as the next playful bet in a market hungry for stories. Meme coins like DOGE and SHIB moved first; now fresh crowds chase newer badges of internet fame. TROLL offers the extra twist of living on many chains, so buyers can pick the network they know best and still join one big tribe. If the current cycle keeps favoring high-risk fun, a low-utility token with loud culture can shine again. Yet the split prices between chains leave room for jumps if they line up. In short, TROLL’s future may depend less on math and more on memes, and memes still rule the feed. SIREN: The Mythic Bridge Bringing DIY Options to Ethereum Fans SIREN is a fresh stop for people who love choice. Built on Ethereum, it lets anyone create, trade, or close an option on any ERC-20 token while coins stay in their own wallet. Every bet is fully backed, so no gaps appear if prices swing. The name borrows from Greek tales and often mixes with talk of smart AI seas. Daily volume and value both sit in the low tens of millions, big enough for action yet small enough to grow fast. Many Web3 coins promise speed, but few give users real control. By skipping middlemen, SIREN feels closer to the core dream of crypto than big exchanges. Its focus on options also sets it apart from the crowded world of simple swaps. If the next market wave lifts Bitcoin and Ether, traders may chase tools that add spice without leaving the chain. SIREN meets that wish. For people who trust on-chain finance and enjoy calling future token prices, the coin looks lively in this cycle. ZORA: The Social NFT Highway Built for Creators and Low Fees ZORA lets artists turn any image, clip, or line of text into an on-chain collectable. It runs on a fast, low-cost copy of Ethereum called a Layer 2, built with the OP Stack. Since its 2021 start, the team has added a friendly mobile app, so minting takes a few taps. A link with the Base network now lets users drop “content coins” that rise or fall with each like and share, blending social buzz with real value. Daily trade numbers stay lively, and the market cap already sits in the hundreds of millions. Many NFT chains chase volume, yet fees still bite. ZORA’s cheap rails give it an edge over older rivals like the main Ethereum chain and even some newer Layer 2s. The focus on creators, not speculators, lines up with a wider trend: social media moving on-chain. If that wave keeps growing, demand for ZORA’s coin could follow. Prices are still below past peaks, so long-term fans may see room to run in this cycle. As always, the biggest gains tend to go to platforms that people use every day. Conclusion MYX, SOON, TROLL, and SIREN have shown strong performance, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out by combining meme culture with sports, aiming for huge growth and community-driven success.

It’s a pivotal moment demonstrating how the Canton Network is changing the game for traditional financial operations. What Makes the Canton Network Trial So Important? On August 9th, leading finance firms conducted a landmark U.S. Treasury repo transaction, leveraging Digital Asset’s innovative Canton Network . This wasn’t just another test; it was a live demonstration of blockchain technology’s power in real-world finance. Participants utilized Tradeweb to tokenize U.S. Treasuries held at The Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. (DTCC), effectively using these digital assets to borrow USDC. The most remarkable aspect? The transaction achieved instant, on-chain settlement. Instant Settlement: Unlike traditional methods that can take days, this trial completed in moments. Direct Transactions: DRW CEO Don Wilson highlighted that this was the first natively issued on-chain Treasury without needing a broker-dealer intermediary, simplifying the process. Major Players: The trial involved heavyweights like Bank of America, Citadel Securities, Circle, and Cumberland, underscoring the serious intent behind this innovation. Unlocking Efficiency with Tokenized Treasuries What exactly are Tokenized Treasuries , and why are they a game-changer? Simply put, they are traditional U.S. Treasury bonds represented as digital tokens on a blockchain. This digital representation allows for seamless transfer and immediate settlement. By converting these stable assets into a digital format, the process of borrowing against them becomes significantly more efficient and transparent. This approach brings several compelling benefits: Reduced Counterparty Risk: The on-chain nature enhances security and reduces reliance on intermediaries. Increased Liquidity: Digital tokens can potentially be traded and settled 24/7, opening new avenues for liquidity. Automation: Smart contracts can automate parts of the repo agreement, reducing manual errors and operational costs. The successful execution on the Canton Network proves the viability of this new paradigm for asset management and lending. The Power of Blockchain Settlement in Finance The core innovation demonstrated in this trial is the concept of blockchain settlement . This refers to the final and irreversible transfer of assets or funds directly on a blockchain network. For a U.S. Treasury repo , this means that once the terms are met, the tokenized Treasuries and USDC change hands almost instantly, without the delays inherent in traditional banking systems. This level of speed and transparency is unprecedented in the repo market. Moreover, the immutable ledger of a blockchain provides a clear audit trail, enhancing trust and compliance. This efficiency is not just about speed; it’s about creating a more robust, secure, and cost-effective financial infrastructure. The implications for financial institutions looking to streamline operations and reduce operational overhead are immense. Paving the Way for Broader Digital Assets Adoption This groundbreaking U.S. Treasury repo trial is just the beginning. According to Bloomberg, more on-chain repos are already planned for later this year. This consistent progression indicates a strong commitment from Wall Street to explore and adopt distributed ledger technology for mainstream financial products. The success of this trial sets a powerful precedent for how other Digital Assets could be integrated into traditional finance. As the financial landscape evolves, the ability to tokenize and instantly settle various asset classes, from equities to real estate, could transform global markets. This move towards tokenized assets and blockchain settlement promises a future where financial transactions are faster, more secure, and accessible. It’s an exciting time to observe how these innovations unfold and reshape our financial world. In conclusion, the successful U.S. Treasury repo trial on the Canton Network represents a monumental step forward for financial markets. By demonstrating the practical benefits of Tokenized Treasuries and instant blockchain settlement , Wall Street is embracing a new era of efficiency and transparency. This is not merely an experiment; it is a clear signal that Digital Assets are poised to play a central role in the future of finance, bringing unprecedented speed and security to transactions once confined to traditional, slower systems.

Reportedly , the world’s largest asset manager has no plans “at this time” to file for a spot XRP ETF, quashing months of speculation it would join at least eight other issuers awaiting U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approval. The decision follows the August 8 resolution of Ripple Labs Inc.’s long-running legal battle with the SEC — a case many believed was the last major hurdle for a regulated XRP product. Competitors in Position BlackRock’s absence leaves the early lead to competitors such as Grayscale Investments, Franklin Templeton and Bitwise Asset Management. Industry veterans say first movers in crypto ETFs tend to capture the lion’s share of liquidity and advisory attention, advantages that can be hard to dislodge. Ignoring crypto assets besides BTC and ETH “makes zero sense”, said Nate Geraci, President of NovaDius Wealth Management. There has been roughly $1 billion in inflows to newly launched futures-based XRP and Solana products this year as evidence of robust appetite for regulated exposure. Managing the Narrative in an ETF-Driven Market For crypto projects the developments around major coins such as XRP can be as pivotal as price action. That’s where firms like Outset PR , founded by crypto PR strategist Mike Ermolaev, have carved out a niche. The agency blends daily market analytics with boutique-level campaign design, ensuring that messaging not only reaches the right media channels but also lands during moments of peak relevance. In a cycle where ETF headlines can trigger billions in market cap shifts overnight, Outset PR’s approach — tailoring pitches to each platform’s audience, mapping campaign timing to market catalysts, and targeting high-discovery outlets — has proven effective for crypto companies seeking to amplify their story in sync with market momentum. The firm’s data-led strategy has driven measurable results for clients such as Step App, Choise.ai, and ChangeNOW, often aligning visibility spikes with token price surges. For projects looking to capture investor mindshare ahead of major catalysts like ETF approvals, such coordinated PR efforts can mean the difference between being part of the headline or buried under it. XRP Price Reaction and Technical Picture XRP has extended its rally to a sixth consecutive month, trading between $2.93 and $3.41 after a 10.36% weekly gain. The token is up 19.26% over the past month and 35.10% in six months, with buyers defending each minor pullback. The coin is holding above both its 10-day and 100-day moving averages at $3.24 and $3.23, respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 57.48, suggesting stable momentum, while a Stochastic Oscillator reading near 87 reflects growing bullish enthusiasm. The MACD remains in positive territory. Immediate resistance is at $3.64, with a more significant barrier at $4.12. Support lies at $2.68 and $2.20. A break above $3.64 would open the way to $4.12 — a potential 25%–30% upside from mid-range levels. Holding above $3.00 keeps that scenario in play; a drop below $2.93 could see retracements toward $2.68 (–15%) or $2.20 (–30%). Trend bias stays upward while price remains above $2.68. The Road Ahead Whether BlackRock’s “not now” becomes “not yet” will hinge on how quickly competitor products scale. A surge in assets could prompt the firm to reverse course, as it did when it entered the Bitcoin ETF race after rivals filed first.

BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH lead inflows in Ethereum ETFs segment. Bitcoin ETFs gain $178 million, marking four straight days of positive inflows. On August 11, 2025, Ethereum-based ETFs received a record investment of $1.02 billion, according to SoSoValue.

The potential plea follows months of negotiations between prosecutors and Kwon’s defense team. Meanwhile, Ethereum core developer Federico Carrone was released after a 24-hour detention in Turkey over alleged links to a privacy protocol, which he insists was purely academic research. His case once again amplified concerns about the criminalization of open-source privacy tools, as seen in the Tornado Cash prosecutions. Carrone has since donated $500,000 in ETH to support Roman Storm’s legal defense. Terraform’s Do Kwon May Alter Plea Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon could be on the verge of changing his plea in the high-profile criminal case against him in the United States. In a Monday filing with the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), Judge Paul Engelmayer scheduled a Tuesday court conference where Kwon “may enter a change of plea.” The move comes after the crypto entrepreneur pleaded not guilty in January to nine felony counts. Some of these counts include securities fraud, market manipulation, money laundering, and wire fraud. Order setting time for Kwon’s plea (Source: SDNY) Kwon’s legal troubles stem from his alleged role in the collapse of the Terra ecosystem in 2022, which wiped out roughly $40 billion in investor assets. After the crash, his whereabouts were unknown for months until he was arrested in Montenegro for trying to use falsified travel documents. Authorities in Montenegro then spent more than a year navigating competing extradition requests from the United States and South Korea, and ultimately handed him over to US officials in December of 2024. Since then, Kwon has been held without bail, and his trial is scheduled to begin in January of 2026. Judge Engelmayer’s order instructed that Kwon be prepared to give a “narrative allocution” in court — which is a detailed statement acknowledging all elements of the offense or offenses to which he may plead guilty. The judge also encouraged his legal counsel to assist in drafting an allocution that could be read in open court. While the specifics of any potential plea agreement have not been disclosed, filings indicate that SDNY prosecutors, led by interim US Attorney Jay Clayton, engaged in “ productive discussions ” with Kwon’s defense team for several months. Do Kwon The conference will take place less than a week after the same court found Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm guilty of operating an unlicensed money transmitting service. Terraform Labs itself previously settled with the US Securities and Exchange Commission in 2024, and agreed to pay roughly $4.5 billion in disgorgement, civil penalties, and prejudgment interest. Overall, the outcome of Tuesday’s hearing could be a huge moment in Kwon’s long-running legal battle. Ethereum Dev Freed Meanwhile, Ethereum core developer Federico Carrone, who is known as “Fede’s Intern” on X, confirmed he was released after spending 24 hours in detention in Turkey over alleged links to an Ethereum privacy protocol. Carrone said that Turkey’s Minister of Internal Affairs accused him of “helping others misuse Ethereum,” which he believes stems from a January 2022 research paper he co-authored assessing privacy on Ethereum and Tornado Cash. He explained that the work was purely academic and did not facilitate illegal activity. The incident now adds to the growing concerns over the arrests of developers connected to open-source privacy tools, like Tornado Cash co-founders Alexey Pertsev and Roman Storm, whose trial in New York could set a precedent for criminalizing such technologies and threatening privacy rights in decentralized finance. Carrone, who is now in Europe, described the initial situation as bleak, with officials planning to confiscate his phone and isolate him from outside contact. He credited his release to quick intervention from friends and supporters across the UAE, UK, US, Europe, Argentina, and even the Catholic Church, along with members of the Solana ecosystem who offered assistance and connections in Turkey. While the case is still active, Carrone’s legal team in Turkey is working on his defense, and he is willing to return to clear his name once matters are resolved. X post from Federico Carrone In a show of solidarity with others facing similar legal challenges, Carrone donated $500,000 worth of Ethereum to support Roman Storm’s legal defense, as he strongly believes in the importance of protecting developers who push innovation forward and ensuring they can rely on community support in times of legal jeopardy.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|ETH|LUNA|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-12 12:30:00

Whales moved over $40 million in SOL to exchanges, some locking in significant profits. Hong Kong approves Solana for retail trading, joining BTC, ETH, AVAX, and LINK on licensed platforms. Price Recovery and Technical Setup Solana (SOL) has climbed back from the $160 support level, touching $185 during the latest trading stretch. According to market watcher BitGuru, the price is tracking an upward trendline and could be on course for a 14% rise toward $210. The bounce follows a series of short pullbacks that failed to break the current uptrend. $SOL strong recovery from the $160 support zone with price climbing to the current $184.73 level.

Momentum remains bullish after a successful rebound from pullbacks. pic.twitter.com/q3vAmC5GvK — BitGuru (@bitgu_ru) August 11, 2025 On the 4-hour SOL/USDT chart, price action continues to form higher lows. This formation, as long as it is held, preserves the bullish trend. Notably, the $210 projection reflects earlier patterns where consolidation phases eventually gave way to strong rallies. Failure to continue through the trendline would jeopardize the prospects, and a constant purchase would be enough to support the rally. Market Snapshot At the time of writing, SOL changes hands at $175, showing a 4% dip over the past day. Trading volume stands at $5.90 billion. Even with the daily loss, the token holds a 3% gain on the week. Past moves on the chart show rapid runs followed by cooling periods. Current trading resembles the early stage of another push upward. Some traders are watching the $168–$170 zone for potential reactions if the market turns lower. Whale Transactions and Liquidations On-chain activity points to notable whale movements. Lookonchain data shows wallet CMJiHu transferred 96,996 SOL, about $17.45 million, to an exchange nine hours ago. Another wallet, 5PjMxa, moved 91,890 SOL ($15.98 million) to Kraken, while HiN7sS sent 37,658 SOL ($6.73 million) to Binance, reportedly booking $1.63 million in gains. Analyst CW reported that a large portion of high-leverage long positions in SOL have been cleared. Trader XO says he is watching the $168–$170 area for a response, while holding spot positions from previous lows and scaling short positions separately. In a separate development, OSL HK, Hong Kong’s first licensed digital asset exchange, has secured approval from the Securities and Futures Commission to allow retail trading of Solana. Meanwhile, this makes SOL the fifth asset cleared for retail in the region, alongside Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Avalanche (AVAX), and Chainlink (LINK). The move broadens regulated access to Solana for Hong Kong’s retail market.

Many believe this real-world payment protocol could be the next 25x gainer before next summer. Let’s see why. Solana’s price predictions forecast unprecedented rise: Bulls target $350 by 2026 SOL trades at $179, up sharply from July’s $140 lows, holding strong support between $175–$180. If network activity continues to expand, Fibonacci models point to $220–$250 in the short term. The Alpenglow consensus upgrade in Q4 2025 will cut transaction finality to under 200ms and boost throughput to 10,000 TPS, fixing some of the scalability issues that previously capped price forecasts. Top degen investors see potential for $1,000 if Solana ETF approvals land, though most analysts maintain a conservative Solana price prediction of $350 by 2026. Remittix revolution: The next 100x crypto breakthrough Forget speculation, Remittix is building a payments network that could disrupt a $19 trillion market. Launching its wallet beta on September 15th, the top Defi project will allow instant crypto-to-fiat transfers in 30+ countries with real-time FX rates and flat, transparent fees. Unlike hype-driven tokens, Remittix solves a real, massive problem: borderless, low-cost payments for both individuals and institutions. Why analysts say buy now, not later : Send crypto directly to bank accounts in seconds Transparent fees, no hidden charges Beta wallet launch September 15th—first movers get early adoption edge API onboarding for businesses could fuel exponential volume growth $20M milestone unlocks major CEX announcement Remittix has already raised $18.9M, selling over 591M RTX tokens. Now the team says when the high growth crypto hits $20M , the first major centralized exchange partner will be revealed, a move that could ignite a 5–10x price surge based on historical CEX listing patterns. Early buyers also get a 40% bonus token allocation , but this vanishes the second the funding goal is reached. Opportunities like this rarely stay quiet for long. The fastest-growing crypto of 2025 is still in presale, but with momentum building and whales accumulating, hesitation could mean watching the next 25x moonshot pass you by. If you want in before the CEX announcement and the inevitable FOMO wave, now is the time to act.

Supercore CPI tracks services inflation excluding housing and energy , making it a key metric for the Federal Reserve when assessing underlying price pressures. This unexpected increase could push the Fed to keep interest rates elevated for longer or even consider further hikes. Higher rates make borrowing more expensive, cool down spending, and typically weigh on risk assets. For crypto markets, persistent inflation and tight monetary policy often translate into short-term volatility and weaker price momentum , as investors shift toward safer, interest-bearing assets. However, if markets interpret this spike as temporary and the Fed signals patience, crypto could benefit from a softer rate outlook later in the year.

Grayscale, a leading name in the crypto investment space, has recently launched new single-asset Grayscale Sui trusts . This move introduces dedicated investment products for the native tokens of Sui’s DeepBook (DEEP) and Walrus (WAL). What Are These New Grayscale Sui Trusts? Grayscale’s latest offerings are private-placement products designed specifically for accredited investors . These trusts hold only the underlying digital assets: DEEP and WAL tokens. This means investors gain exposure to these specific tokens without directly owning or managing them. This approach simplifies the investment process, providing a regulated vehicle for institutional and high-net-worth individuals to participate in the growing Sui blockchain ecosystem. It’s a significant development for those looking for structured ways to diversify their digital asset portfolios. Why Are DEEP and WAL Tokens Significant on Sui Blockchain? The Sui blockchain is gaining traction for its high performance and developer-friendly environment. Within this ecosystem, DeepBook functions as a central limit order book (CLOB) DEX, while Walrus provides essential infrastructure services. The native tokens, DEEP WAL tokens , are integral to the functionality and governance of these platforms. Grayscale’s decision to launch trusts for these specific tokens highlights their belief in the long-term potential and utility of the Sui network and its foundational projects. How Do These Crypto Trusts Benefit Investors? For accredited investors , these new crypto trusts offer several key advantages: Regulated Access: Investors can gain exposure to DEEP and WAL through a familiar, regulated financial product, reducing the complexities often associated with direct crypto purchases. Custody Solutions: Grayscale handles the secure custody of the underlying tokens, removing the burden and risk of self-custody for investors. Diversification: These trusts provide a new avenue for portfolio diversification within the digital asset space, focusing on specific ecosystem tokens. Institutional Adoption: The launch of such products by a prominent asset manager like Grayscale signals increasing institutional confidence in the broader crypto market and specific blockchain ecosystems like Sui. This development makes it easier for sophisticated investors to access promising, yet niche, digital assets. What Are the Considerations for Accredited Investors? While these Grayscale Sui trusts offer compelling benefits, it’s important for accredited investors to consider certain aspects: Liquidity: Private placement products often have limited liquidity compared to publicly traded assets. Investors should understand the redemption and trading mechanisms. Fees: Grayscale charges management fees, which can impact overall returns. Investors should carefully review the fee structure. Market Volatility: The underlying DEEP and WAL tokens, like most cryptocurrencies, are subject to significant price volatility. Accreditation Requirements: Access is restricted to accredited investors, meaning individuals or entities meeting specific income or net worth criteria. Understanding these factors is crucial for making informed investment decisions in the digital asset space. Looking Ahead: The Impact of Grayscale’s Move Grayscale’s expansion into new single-asset crypto trusts for the Sui blockchain and its DEEP WAL tokens underscores a broader trend of institutionalization in the crypto market. As more traditional financial players offer structured products, it paves the way for greater mainstream adoption and liquidity. This initiative not only validates the potential of the Sui ecosystem but also offers a template for how other emerging blockchain projects might attract institutional capital. It’s a clear signal that the digital asset landscape continues to mature, offering increasingly diverse and sophisticated investment vehicles. Conclusion: A New Horizon for Crypto Investments The introduction of Grayscale’s single-asset trusts for DEEP and WAL tokens marks an important milestone. It provides accredited investors with a professional, regulated pathway to gain exposure to key assets within the dynamic Sui blockchain . This move strengthens the institutional bridge to the crypto world, promising more accessible and diverse investment opportunities in the future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are Grayscale’s new trusts for DEEP and WAL? Grayscale has launched single-asset private-placement trusts for DEEP and WAL, the native tokens of Sui’s DeepBook and Walrus. These trusts allow investors to gain exposure to the tokens without directly holding them. Q2: Who can invest in these Grayscale Sui trusts? These trusts are exclusively open to accredited investors, meaning individuals or entities that meet specific financial criteria as defined by regulatory bodies. Q3: What is the significance of DEEP and WAL tokens? DEEP and WAL are native tokens of key projects on the Sui blockchain. DEEP is associated with DeepBook (a CLOB DEX), and WAL is linked to Walrus (infrastructure services), both integral to the Sui ecosystem’s functionality. Q4: How do these crypto trusts differ from buying tokens directly? These crypto trusts offer a regulated investment vehicle with Grayscale managing custody, unlike direct token purchases which require self-custody and navigate unregulated exchanges. They are designed for institutional access. Q5: Why is Grayscale investing in the Sui blockchain? Grayscale’s investment in the Sui blockchain through these trusts indicates their confidence in Sui’s technology, ecosystem growth, and the potential of its native tokens (DEEP and WAL) as viable digital assets for institutional portfolios.

The agreement covers both the company’s digital asset treasury holdings and the mining operations of its Caret subsidiary. Notably, this move marks a significant step in VivoPower’s ongoing transformation into an XRP-focused digital asset enterprise. Crypto.com Custody to offer custody services for VivoPower Under the arrangement, Crypto.com Custody will provide institutional-grade custody services across multiple international jurisdictions. The platform is designed to deliver high-security solutions for institutional and high-net-worth clients, ensuring that assets are managed with stringent safety protocols. By tapping into Crypto.com’s infrastructure, VivoPower secures a more sophisticated and scalable custody system for its digital holdings. This is a critical component for any company managing substantial cryptocurrency reserves, particularly when those holdings are central to its strategic direction. Expanding investor access and liquidity Beyond custody, the partnership opens new market access for VivoPower shares. Through Crypto.com’s broker-dealer platform, VVPR shares will become available to a reported 150 million crypto-native users worldwide. This integration has the potential to expand liquidity significantly, bridging the gap between traditional equity investors and the rapidly growing cryptocurrency community. For traders, this means that the VVPR stock will now be accessible through a platform they already use for digital assets, offering a smoother and more familiar trading experience. The increased exposure could translate into greater market activity and a broader shareholder base. Strengthening VivoPower’s XRP-focused strategy VivoPower has been clear about its pivot toward an XRP-centric digital asset strategy. This partnership reinforces that commitment by giving shareholders access to liquidity for XRP and other digital assets. It also includes the opportunity to participate in upcoming XRP restaking through Flare, a platform with which VivoPower already has a working relationship. Kevin Chin, Executive Chairman of VivoPower, said the deal provides not only operational advantages but also strategic value. By aligning with a recognised name in the crypto sector, the company gains added credibility in both the traditional finance and digital asset spaces. The cross-market appeal This collaboration is more than a technical upgrade; it is a bridge between two investment worlds. Crypto.com’s presence in the crypto-native market and VivoPower’s listing on NASDAQ combine to create a unique investment proposition. The arrangement appeals to conventional investors looking for digital asset exposure and crypto traders interested in equity plays linked to blockchain adoption. Eric Anziani, President and COO of Crypto.com, described the platform as “purpose-built for today and tomorrow’s market,” underscoring its readiness to serve both institutional and retail participants. For VivoPower, this partnership could accelerate its growth trajectory while solidifying its reputation as a forward-looking, blockchain-integrated enterprise.

While Cardano upgrades are gathering momentum, and XRP price potential attracts more interest, there’s increasing competition from a fast-growing PayFi sensation that’s already surging, Remittix (RTX) . This low-cap crypto gem is on the rise with growth and profit delivery. Can XRP price smash $5 this year? Market sentiments around the XRP price prediction have been positive, with the altcoin gaining more market share and displaying technical strength. This PayFi OG recently broke out of a bullish flag pattern on the weekly chart, which often signals continued uptrends. According to popular analyst, Ali Martinez , the XRP price could reach $5 in the short term and make a further run toward $11, provided the momentum persists and overall sentiment remains positive. Source: Ali Martinez Is Cardano Heading for a Breakout? Cardano (ADA) is smashing through its long-term descending triangle, which suggests a momentum shift. As the Cardano price continues to trade above 0.64, the next resistance levels are set at 0.85 and 0.93. With the recent rise in whale accumulation and 75.42 percent of the square positions on large platforms going long, this bullish projection is confirmed. Cardano’s recent bullish momentum could see ADA reach anywhere between $1.00 and $1.50, with longer-term forecasts tipping growth to $3.00. Still, these resistance levels will test Cardano’s improvement, and it must strengthen its volume rise. Source: TradingView Can the Remittix DeFi Project Outshine Cardano and XRP Price Predictions?

Witt had a brief stint as a free-agent quarterback for the New Orleans Saints after leading the Yale Bulldogs team that Hines later played on as wide receiver. Both ex-athletes tied their political careers closely to Trump in recent years, and Witt will now be the chief industry liaison for Trump's White House, according to his social-media profile on X that references the title Hines left behind. As executive director of the President's Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, Witt ascends to the role without a significant crypto background, though Hines also occupied the role without a deep digital assets past. ""We've had the pleasure of working with Patrick throughout the year and look forward to him continuing to implement policies that will make the United States this global hub of crypto innovation and development,"" said Miller Whitehouse-Levine, CEO of the Solana Policy Institute, in a statement. When Witt helped introduce Trump at a rally in 2022, he told the crowd that ""government, too often, is the problem."" But the graduate of Harvard Law School spent some time serving at the federal level and describes himself as a ""public servant"" on his LinkedIn account. Witt has a few of the common resume staples of D.C. careers: Three years at McKinsey & Co., and past stints at the Office of Personnel Management in the first Trump presidency and some time at the Department of Defense. But in his home state of Georgia, his political career hadn't yet found momentum, with a failed bid to be the state's insurance commissioner (under a promise to "" keep your insurance from going woke "") and a brief effort to run for Congress. Though his predecessor at the White House recently celebrated the significant win of the first U.S. crypto legislation to establish a law governing stablecoins, Hines left a major to-do list. When Congress returns from its summer break, Witt will have to get a handle on progress toward a Senate version of the House-passed Digital Asset Market Clarity Act. Hines had also been closely monitoring developments in the formation of what the administration calls its Bitcoin Strategic Reserve — a project the industry has been eager to see progress on since an order from Trump earlier this year started work on it ""I love this community and all we’ve built together,"" Hines said in a farewell posting on X , surprising the industry by leaving after less than a year on the job. ""As I return to the private sector, I look forward to continuing my support for the crypto ecosystem as it thrives here in the United States."" Witt re-posted that sentiment but hasn't yet made his own agenda clear. The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on his promotion. Trump's most senior crypto policy chief, David Sacks, remains in his position.

Key Takeaways: Kazakh authorities shut down a $16.5M illegal power scheme. Mining firms received over 50 megawatt-hours of electricity in violation of rules. Kazakhstan is tightening mining regulations while advancing plans for a state crypto reserve. The Department of Financial Monitoring (DFM) for the East Kazakhstan region, working with the National Security Committee (NSC), found that several electricity companies had illegally diverted power over the past two years. The diverted electricity was meant for the public and strategically important enterprises but was supplied to mining firms instead. Kazakhstan Law Limits Crypto Miners to State-Run Power Platform Under Kazakhstan’s Digital Assets Law (No. 194-VII), miners are required to source electricity exclusively through the Ministry of Energy’s state-run platform and may only tap into the national grid during documented surpluses. Officials say the companies bypassed these rules, supplying miners with over 50 megawatt-hours of electricity, enough to power a city of up to 70,000 residents. “With the criminal proceeds, the organizer purchased two apartments and four cars in the capital. These assets have been frozen by court order for potential confiscation,” authorities stated. Once a global hotspot for crypto mining following China’s 2021 crackdown, Kazakhstan has tightened its energy and licensing rules, citing concerns over power shortages and strain on infrastructure. The regulatory shift has triggered a wave of miner departures, with Bitcoin mining rig maker Canaan among the latest to exit the country. This is Kazakhstan: – 10% flat tax & 0% wealth tax – Former #2 Bitcoin mining nation globally – World's first Solana Economic Zone launched 2025 The 9th largest country is now a hidden crypto laboratory. Here are 8 reasons why Kazakhstan should be on your radar: pic.twitter.com/4gzutNIO0n — Alessandro Palombo (@thealepalombo) July 11, 2025 In June, Kazakhstan officially announced plans to establish a state crypto reserve , with National Bank Chairman Timur Suleimenov revealing that confiscated criminal assets and state-backed mining operations will serve as primary funding sources. Suleimenov outlined that the reserve will follow international best practices for sovereign fund management. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has also unveiled plans for “CryptoCity” , a pilot zone where cryptocurrencies can be used for everyday payments, signaling the government’s commitment to real-world crypto adoption. The proposed crypto banking system will provide integrated services including digital asset exchange, storage, and transaction processing within regulated parameters. Russia Uses Kyrgyz Crypto Hub to Evade Sanctions As reported, Russian entities are exploiting Kyrgyzstan’s crypto infrastructure to bypass international sanctions and procure dual-use goods for use in Ukraine. Following the passage of Kyrgyzstan’s “On Virtual Assets” law in January 2022, just weeks before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the country has transformed into a burgeoning crypto hub. The law introduced formal licensing and oversight for virtual asset service providers (VASPs), paving the way for a rapid influx of new firms and exchanges. By October 2024, 126 VASP licenses had been issued, and transaction volumes had surged from $59 million in 2022 to $4.2 billion in the first seven months of 2024 alone. However, that boom has opened the door to abuse. According to TRM Labs, numerous Kyrgyz-registered exchanges appear to serve as shell entities, with multiple firms reusing the same addresses, contact information, and founders.

Latest figures suggest that it recorded $97.7 million and accounting for 35% of total fees across chains. Hyperliquid Dominates Fee Charts Hyperliquid regularly allocates part of this revenue for HYPE token buybacks, contributing to upward price pressure. Tron ranked second with $58.8 million in fees, followed by Ethereum at $45 million, Solana at $41.1 million, Bitcoin at $16.3 million, and BNB Chain at $10.6 million. Beyond fees, Hyperliquid emerged as a dominant force in Q2 2025, as it recorded $648 billion in trading volume for the quarter and $1.57 trillion over the past 12 months, according to CoinMarketCap’s recent report. The platform generated over $300 million in revenue during the period, and secured more than 60% of the perpetual DEX market, a performance which CMC estimates to be roughly 10 times stronger than its nearest rival. Growth was driven by multiple factors, including the HYPE token airdrop and fair point system in late 2024, which boosted user engagement. Traders were also attracted to Hyperliquid’s streamlined interface, API, deep liquidity, and steady arbitrage opportunities. High-profile figures such as James Wynn further amplified attention, while the platform’s HYPE token buyback and burn program supported price stability. Meanwhile, VanEck analysts recently said that Hyperliquid has successfully “poached” high-value users from Solana, thereby challenging one of the latter’s long-standing strengths. For years, the bullish case for Solana rested on its strong ecosystem of builders utilizing its industry-leading transaction processing capabilities, which were expected to back strong trading activity. However, VanEck noted that Solana has failed to deliver meaningful improvements to ramp up user experience in the perpetual futures (perps) sector, which created an opportunity for Hyperliquid to step in with a more advanced and user-friendly product. HYPE Price Action Over the past week, HYPE has seen a notable upward trajectory, starting near $39.27 on August 6 before dipping slightly in early trading. Momentum picked up on August 8, which led to a steady rally that pushed the price above $46 on August 11. This surge represented a gain of nearly 18% from the weekly low. However, the rally was followed by a moderate pullback, as the token consolidated around the $42-$44 range. At the time of writing, HYPE is trading near $43.

The collaboration includes an initial allocation of $25 million in BONK tokens as part of a comprehensive BONK treasury initiative. $BONK contributor @TheOnlyNom announces first stage of $BONK ( @bonk_inu ) Digital Asset Treasury with SafetyShotINC, establishing an initial $25M $BONK reserve. pic.twitter.com/2FSx4IA8lA — The Solana Post (@thesolanapost) August 11, 2025 A recent press statement reveals that Safety Shot is positioning itself for this treasury approach by first resolving all pending debt obligations while maintaining a robust balance sheet exceeding $15 million in cash reserves. The company plans to issue Preferred Shares valued at $35 million, which will be convertible into common stock shares. Safety Shot BONK Treasury Strategy Intensifies TradFi Memecoin Bet Safety Shot explained that their choice to designate BONK as their primary treasury asset stems from its distinct competitive advantages, particularly the technical benefits offered by the Solana blockchain, including rapid transaction speeds and minimal costs. The first stage of the BONK Digital Asset Treasury is here @bonk_inu is partnering with @SafetyShotINC to establish an initial reserve of $25M in $BONK Another strong step in growing The Dog’s reach, partnerships & long-term firepower #LetsBONK pic.twitter.com/bf5dbGcPgI — bjoern (@bjoernbonk) August 11, 2025 These specifics influenced their selection over Ethereum-based alternatives such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE), or inflationary tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE). Safety Shot’s transition toward becoming a BONK treasury company was facilitated by their exclusive financial advisor, Dominari Securities, LLC, which previously assisted in establishing a Tron treasury company. A source close to the Safety Shot partnership revealed that the BONK treasury initiative had been under development for “several months,” with Monday’s $25 million announcement representing merely the opening phase. Furthermore, this partnership is anticipated to strengthen Safety Shot’s financial standing, diversify its asset portfolio, and create new opportunities for shareholder value enhancement. The traditional beverage company is currently listed on NASDAQ under the ticker SHOT, and has declined 93.65% from its peak of $8.88 in February 2021 to $0.5582, based on TradingView data. Source: TradingView Over the past 24 hours, SHOT has dropped 51.04% and currently maintains a market capitalization of $73.4 million. In contrast, BONK’s market cap exceeds $1.93 billion. Examining comparable cases like BitMine Immersion, which accumulated 833,000 ETH worth $2.9 billion (approximately 5% of Ethereum’s supply) following their Ethereum treasury strategy launch, the company’s BMNR stock surged over 500% within a single week and has achieved 637.25% year-to-date gains. Safety Shot’s stock could potentially replicate this performance if its BONK treasury strategy is consistently implemented. Wall Street Embraces Meme Coins As Treasury Strategy and ETF Race Heats Up Safety Shot’s decision to establish a BONK treasury strategy is part of a broader trend of publicly traded companies exploring memecoin-focused treasury approaches. Recent months have witnessed an acceleration in corporate announcements within this sector. In late July, NASDAQ-listed Bit Origin unveiled plans for a $500 million DOGE treasury, positioning the company as the “MicroStrategy of DOGE.” Earlier, Everything Blockchain Inc also announced MemeStrategy , a spinoff entity designed to hold and manage a diversified memecoin portfolio, including PEPE, BONK, and SPX6900. There have also been initiatives to bring meme coins to traditional Wall Street investors through ETF products. At the beginning of 2025, Bitwise, the leading crypto index fund manager, submitted a filing for a Dogecoin (DOGE) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Delaware. This initiative progressed further when NYSE Arca officially submitted a 19b-4 proposal to list and trade its shares. Similarly, prominent asset manager 21Shares announced on April 9 its partnership with the House of Doge to introduce Europe’s first Dogecoin ETP. The Dogecoin ETP will be listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange under the ticker DOGE, providing traditional EU investors with greater accessibility to the cryptocurrency. Beyond Dogecoin, popular meme coins like PENGU have recently attracted attention through Canary Capital’s S-1 registration filing , seeking U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval for a new ETF designed to invest in the $PENGU meme coin and Pudgy Penguins non-fungible tokens.

Rise or Fall?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/expert-analysts-share-their-bitcoin-btc-and-ethereum-eth-price-expectations-rise-or-fall/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has generally traded below $120,000 since its ATH surpassed $123,000 on July 14. However, yesterday, BTC briefly surpassed $122,000 and came very close to its previous ATH. While people were wondering which direction Bitcoin, which was then pulled back below $120,000, would move, FxPro senior analyst Alex Kuptsikevich shared his current analysis. The Next Target for Bitcoin is the $135,000-$138,000 Range! Speaking to Coindesk, Alex Kuptsikevich reported that Bitcoin has broken through the $120,000 technical barrier, increasing its potential for further upside. Stating that there is potential for further rise in Bitcoin, the analyst said that the nearest price target for BTC is currently between $135,000 and $138,000. “Bitcoin has already broken through the $120,000 technical barrier. The current potential nearest target price is between $135,000 and $138,000. “Furthermore, this is one of the rare cases where a major altcoin rally fueled Bitcoin's rally.” Bitfinex analysts, on the other hand, stated that although Bitcoin has started to rise, the price is dependent on important data such as the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) to be released this week. “Whether Bitcoin's upward momentum will continue depends on macroeconomic data from the US,” Bitfinex analysts said. At this point, a CPI data above expectations could trigger renewed selling pressure. It Wouldn't Be Surprising If Ethereum Broke a Record! Alex Kuptsikevich also commented on Ethereum (ETH). Offering a positive outlook for Ethereum, as he does for Bitcoin, Kuptsikevich said it's possible for Ethereum to surpass the $4,891 price it reached in November 2021. “Ethereum's price is up more than 21% in the last 7 days and 45% in the last 30 days. On-chain transaction volume and address growth rate are also approaching all-time highs. “Furthermore, it wouldn't be surprising if a new all-time high is reached in the coming days.” *This is not investment advice.

This initial stock market opening provides a fascinating snapshot of investor confidence and underlying economic currents. For anyone tracking global finance, understanding these early movements is absolutely crucial, as they often set the tone for the day’s broader market activity. This immediate divergence across major indices signals a nuanced landscape, prompting many to ask: what factors are at play? Understanding Today’s Dynamic Stock Market Opening The concept of a mixed market opening is not uncommon, yet it always sparks curiosity. It means that while some major indices are climbing, others are experiencing declines, creating a complex picture for analysts and investors alike. This particular stock market opening reflects a tug-of-war between various economic forces and sector-specific news. Sector Rotation: Investors might be shifting funds from one industry to another, leading to gains in some areas and losses in others. Economic Data: Recent economic reports, whether positive or negative, can influence different market segments unevenly. Corporate Earnings: Individual company earnings reports can heavily sway specific indices, especially if tech giants report contrasting results. Federal Reserve Outlook: Speculation or announcements regarding interest rates and monetary policy can impact growth stocks differently than value stocks. Such a dynamic start to trading underscores the importance of looking beyond headline numbers and delving into the specifics of each index’s performance. A Closer Look at Major U.S. Stock Markets Performance Let’s dive into the specifics of how the key U.S. stock markets are performing right out of the gate today. The initial figures paint a clear picture of divergence: S&P 500: +0.48% The S&P 500, often considered a barometer for the broader U.S. equity market, is showing a positive gain. This suggests underlying strength in a wide array of sectors, indicating general market resilience. Its positive movement often reflects confidence in the overall economic outlook or a flight towards established, stable companies. NASDAQ: -0.30% In contrast, the NASDAQ Composite, heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks, is experiencing a slight decline. This dip in NASDAQ performance could be attributed to various factors, including profit-taking after recent gains, concerns over rising interest rates potentially impacting future earnings for growth companies, or specific news from major tech players. Dow Jones Industrial Average: +0.48% Mirroring the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is also up significantly. Comprising 30 large, publicly traded companies, primarily industrial and blue-chip stocks, its positive movement often signals strength in traditional economic sectors and a belief in the stability of established corporations. This side-by-side view highlights the nuanced nature of the current trading environment, where different segments of the economy are reacting uniquely to prevailing conditions. Why the NASDAQ Performance Differs Today? The slight underperformance of the NASDAQ today, despite positive movements in other major indices, warrants a closer look. The NASDAQ performance is particularly sensitive to shifts in investor sentiment regarding growth stocks and interest rate expectations. When interest rates are expected to rise, the future earnings of growth companies, which are a significant component of the NASDAQ, become less valuable in present terms. This can lead investors to re-evaluate their positions and potentially shift capital towards more value-oriented or cyclical stocks found more commonly in the Dow or S&P 500. Additionally, specific company news within the tech sector, such as regulatory concerns, supply chain issues, or even just a period of profit-taking after a strong run, can collectively impact the index. Understanding these underlying drivers is key to interpreting the broader movements across U.S. stock markets . Navigating the Market: Implications for Investors For investors, a mixed stock market opening requires careful consideration and a strategic approach. It’s not simply about whether the market is up or down, but where the strength and weakness lie. This environment presents both challenges and opportunities. Diversification is Key: A mixed market underscores the importance of a diversified portfolio. Relying too heavily on one sector, like technology, when it’s underperforming can lead to disproportionate losses. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on economic indicators, corporate earnings, and Federal Reserve communications. These factors significantly influence market direction. Long-Term Perspective: Short-term fluctuations are normal. Successful investors often maintain a long-term view, avoiding knee-jerk reactions to daily market movements. Evaluate Your Goals: Reassess your investment goals and risk tolerance. A mixed market might prompt a rebalance of your portfolio to align with your objectives. Understanding the dynamics of each index, from the robust S&P 500 to the nuanced NASDAQ performance , empowers investors to make more informed decisions rather than reacting impulsively to headline figures. The resilience shown by the Dow Jones Industrial Average , for instance, could point to underlying stability in traditional industries. The dynamic stock market opening today highlights the complex interplay of factors influencing financial markets. From the robust gains in the Dow and S&P 500 to the slight dip in NASDAQ performance , these movements offer valuable insights into current economic sentiment. Staying informed about these shifts is paramount for making sound investment decisions and navigating the ever-evolving landscape of the U.S. stock markets . Remember, every market movement, whether up or down, provides a learning opportunity for astute investors. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What does a “mixed” stock market opening mean? A mixed opening signifies that while some major stock market indices are trading higher, others are experiencing declines. This indicates varying investor sentiment across different sectors or types of companies. 2. Why did the NASDAQ perform differently from the S&P 500 and Dow Jones today? The NASDAQ, being tech-heavy, is often more sensitive to factors like interest rate expectations or specific tech sector news. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones, representing broader or traditional industries, may react differently to economic data or corporate earnings, leading to divergence. 3. How should investors react to a mixed market opening? Investors should avoid impulsive reactions. It’s crucial to consider the broader economic context, individual company fundamentals, and maintain a diversified portfolio. A mixed market often highlights the importance of long-term investment strategies. 4. Are these early market movements indicative of the whole day’s trend? While the initial stock market opening sets the tone, it does not guarantee the day’s overall trend. Markets can shift throughout the day based on new economic data, news, or investor sentiment. It’s a snapshot, not a definitive forecast. Did you find this analysis of the U.S. stock markets helpful?

The plan will help build trust and momentum towards practical application and this is what is lacking in most hype-driven projects with no utility. Delivery of Pi tokens to KYB-approved partners, as well as payment platforms serving more than 100 countries and the majority of local payment methods, has already begun. This type of business-centric model is combined with the KYC verification of users and provides security and compliance. Through regulating the issuance of tokens into the market, the team behind Pi is aspiring to reduce speculative dumping and instead establish a strong focus on utility in its expanding environment. Expanding Liquidity Community analysts say this controlled rollout helps Pi reach participants who are more likely to use it for payments, services, and peer-to-peer transfers rather than just flipping it for short-term gains. KYB-verified businesses are the only ones allowed to hold and transact Pi on the mainnet, a safeguard designed to protect the network from fraudulent activity. While centralized exchange listings remain in the plan, they are no longer the primary way Pi will expand liquidity. Growing Buzz Around a New Crypto Contender Amid these shifts, veteran crypto investors have been turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE, whose platform is being developed as it moves toward a major exchange listing. The early investors are speculating on what they believe to be an eventually massive growth cycle , in relation to the high early-stage demand to the project and its community development. One of the most common selling points is the belief by many that it is a strategy whose potential could compete with most breakout tokens , and that leads to high returns. Building for the Long Term The new initiatives of Pi Network can be described as part of the wider strategy to increase its technological foundation, such as the implementation of the Stellar Protocol 23. Simultaneously, the core team is striving to improve the education of the community in general to resist and eliminate misinformation and make sure that the users possess the real knowledge about the project path. The motions indicate the emphasis on long-term growth, as opposed to temporary, spikes. Outlook for Pi Coin While the market can be unpredictable, Pi’s new distribution model could give it an advantage as blockchain projects face increasing scrutiny from regulators. If adoption through verified partners continues to grow and the ecosystem matures, the project could see renewed confidence from both retail users and businesses, potentially fueling long-term price growth and setting the stage for a push back toward previous highs. Ultimately, the move of Pi Network to a compliance driven, utility based-model is a potentially critical change.Seasoned investors are already spotting opportunities in projects that feel both familiar and innovative, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE.

The cryptocurrency world recently buzzed with news of a colossal USDT transfer , drawing attention to significant movements within the digital asset landscape. Whale Alert, a prominent blockchain tracker, reported a staggering 400,000,000 USDT moving from the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Aave to the centralized exchange HTX. This massive transaction, valued at approximately $400 million, immediately sparked discussions among investors and analysts about its potential implications. Understanding the USDT Transfer : What Happened? On [Insert Date of Whale Alert report if known, otherwise keep general], the crypto community observed a monumental shift of funds. A single USDT transfer involving 400 million Tether tokens originated from Aave, a leading DeFi lending and borrowing platform. The destination for these substantial funds was HTX, a well-known centralized cryptocurrency exchange. This event signifies a major repositioning of stablecoin assets. Such large movements are often indicative of strategic decisions by significant market participants, commonly referred to as “whales.” The transfer amount, equivalent to $400 million, highlights the sheer scale of the transaction. Understanding the nature of this movement is crucial. Was it a liquidation, a strategic rebalancing, or something else entirely? These questions naturally arise when a whale transaction of this magnitude occurs. Why Such a Large Whale Transaction ? Large transfers like this whale transaction are not uncommon in the volatile crypto market, but their specific motivations can vary widely. When a substantial amount of USDT moves from a DeFi protocol like Aave to a centralized exchange, several scenarios could be at play. Possible reasons include: De-risking: A whale might be reducing their exposure to DeFi protocols, perhaps due to perceived risks or a desire for increased liquidity on a centralized platform. Profit-taking: Funds might be moving to an exchange to convert stablecoins into fiat currency or other cryptocurrencies after a profitable venture. Arbitrage opportunities: Differences in stablecoin pricing or trading pairs between Aave and HTX could present arbitrage chances. Preparation for large trades: The whale might be accumulating funds on HTX to execute significant buy or sell orders for other assets. Collateral management: Repaying a large loan on Aave, thereby releasing the collateral, which is then moved to HTX. This would be a key aspect for Aave lending users. Each of these possibilities carries different implications for market sentiment and future movements. Implications for Aave Lending and HTX The direct impact on both Aave and HTX warrants a closer look. For Aave lending , such a large withdrawal of USDT could mean a decrease in the available liquidity for borrowing, potentially affecting interest rates or utilization ratios in the short term. However, Aave’s robust design typically handles large withdrawals without significant disruption. On the other hand, the influx of 400 million USDT into HTX exchange significantly boosts its stablecoin reserves. This could: Enhance the exchange’s overall liquidity. Support larger trading volumes for USDT pairs. Potentially attract more institutional traders looking for deep liquidity. This event underscores the interconnectedness of DeFi and centralized finance (CeFi), where funds flow between platforms based on user strategies and market conditions. It’s a testament to the dynamic nature of crypto asset management. The Bigger Picture: Impact on Crypto Liquidity A 400 million dollar USDT transfer undeniably impacts the broader crypto liquidity landscape. USDT is the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, and its movements are closely watched indicators of market health and activity. When such a substantial amount shifts from a DeFi protocol to a CEX, it often signals a change in how whales perceive and utilize their capital. Increased stablecoin liquidity on exchanges can facilitate larger trades, potentially leading to more volatile price action for other cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a decrease in stablecoin liquidity in DeFi might indicate a shift away from decentralized applications for certain activities. This particular movement suggests that the whale might be preparing for more active trading or a more conservative approach by holding funds on a centralized platform, rather than keeping them in a DeFi lending pool. Navigating Stablecoin Movements on HTX Exchange For users of HTX exchange , this substantial USDT transfer generally translates to improved liquidity for trading pairs involving USDT. Higher liquidity means: Tighter bid-ask spreads, reducing trading costs. Less slippage for large orders. A more efficient market overall. While a single transaction of this size is noteworthy, it also highlights the inherent transparency of blockchain technology. Tools like Whale Alert allow the public to monitor these large movements, providing valuable insights into market sentiment and potential future trends. This transparency helps users and analysts make more informed decisions when engaging with platforms like Aave and HTX. In conclusion, the 400 million USDT transfer from Aave to HTX is a prime example of the dynamic and often strategic movements undertaken by large players in the crypto market. Whether driven by de-risking, arbitrage, or preparation for future trades, such colossal transactions have ripple effects across DeFi and CeFi, influencing crypto liquidity and market dynamics. Monitoring these whale activities provides crucial insights into the evolving landscape of digital finance, offering a glimpse into the sophisticated strategies that shape the market.

The potential approval of the first spot XRP ETF in the US could also drive the price higher. More Room for Growth? Despite a slight price decline over the past 24 hours, Ripple’s XRP remains one of the top performers in the crypto market during this bull cycle. It currently trades at around $3.14 ( per CoinGecko’s data), representing a whopping 470% price increase since November 2024. Its rally in the last few months aligned with the overall resurgence of the cryptocurrency market, as well as the official conclusion of the Ripple v. SEC lawsuit, which had been dragging on for years. The key question here is whether XRP has enough fuel left in the tank for further gains. To estimate its potential chances, we decided to ask three AIs about their take on the matter. ChatGPT answered the XRP’s bull run in 2025 is not over, outlining certain factors that point to continued upside. One of those includes the resolution of the aforementioned legal battle, which, according to the AI-powered chatbot, removed a major overhang and could help the asset’s price climb even further. It also noted the recent accumulation from whales: an element that might also trigger a rally. As CryptoPotato reported , large investors purchased 900 million XRP (equivalent to $2.8 billion) in the span of 48 hours . Such acquisitions remove a large amount of coins from the open market and can push the price up if demand stays strong. Grok also believes the bull run is not over. The AI chatbot built into the social media platform X said XRP’s price pattern has formed a bull pennant, which can be followed by a possible price explosion to as high as $20 in Q4 2025. Additionally, it pointed to the overall optimism among analysts and market observers. However, it didn’t rule out the possibility of a price collapse to $2.20 or even lower. “Bearish scenarios include a failure to break key resistance levels or macroeconomic headwinds, which could lead to pullbacks toward $2.20 or lower.” Lastly, we will observe Claude’s estimation. The language model chatbot said XRP’s bull run in 2025 “appears far from over,” adding that technical analysts believe the asset has not yet entered its “full bull” phase. Similar to ChatGPT, it mentioned positive factors such as the $50 million settlement between Ripple and the SEC and the launch of the first futures-based XRP ETF in America earlier this year. Claude’s short-term target for XRP is in the $3.50-$3.75 range, whereas the medium-term ones stretch to as high as $11.20 by October 2025 . It is worth mentioning that Claude differs from other chatbots in a way where it aggregates user-generated internet entries and provides a summarized analysis based on them. Waiting for This Event One factor that may trigger an additional price increase for Ripple’s cross-border token is the potential approval of the first spot XRP ETF in the United States. The investment vehicle will enable individuals to gain exposure to the asset directly through regular brokerage accounts. This easy access can attract more institutional and retail buyers, boosting demand and potentially driving XRP’s price higher. Some of the well-known companies willing to file such a product include Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, ProShares, Bitwise, WisdomTree, and Canary Capital. According to Polymarket, the approval chances before the end of 2025 stand at 81%.

49977680,554042,1755007229,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49977680.jpeg,"Spot XRP ETFs Set To Crush Ethereum’s, Predicts Canary Capital CEO",https://bitcoinist.com/spot-xrp-etfs-crush-ethereum-canary-capital-ceo/,"In a wide-ranging conversation with Paul Barron, Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg laid out a blunt, three-pronged case for why spot XRP ETFs could debut with stronger demand than their Ethereum counterparts—and keep it. His core argument rests on the absence of staking yield cannibalizing ETF demand, XRP’s category leadership in traditional financial rails, and what he describes as unusually deep community and institutional interest ready to convert into flows the moment approvals land. Why XRP Could Beat ETH From The Start McClurg’s first point is mechanical and immediate: Ethereum’s native yield is a headwind for its ETFs; XRP has no such drag. “If you’re actually a bit more cryptonative, you’re not going to buy an ETH ETF because you can … get a 2 to 3% yield,” he said, noting that investors comfortable with self-custody or on-chain tools can harvest staking rewards that a plain beta ETF does not deliver [thus far]. By contrast, “since XRP doesn’t offer that … you’re not losing out on anything,” which, in his view, removes a key reason for yield-sensitive buyers to bypass the fund wrapper. The way he frames it, Ethereum’s best feature for on-chain holders is precisely what limits the appeal of an off-chain ETF, at least until regulators permit staking within the funds—a change he says issuers are actively discussing: “We are all talking to the SEC and then trying to get staking allowed in the ETFs .” From there, he shifts to positioning. McClurg casts XRP as the clear leader in a different category than Ethereum, and one he believes aligns more directly with how incumbent finance actually moves money. “I really see XRP as the leader in more traditional financial services rails,” he said, describing cross-border payments, remittances and institutional settlement as the network’s center of gravity. He contrasts that with Ethereum, which he places in a broader, more competitive bucket of “open-source protocols,” arguing that its relative advantage has narrowed: “Ethereum did a lot … but Ethereum is now old technology … older, slower, less secure, more expensive to run. And there’s a lot better opportunities out there in my opinion,” he added, reaching for a consumer-tech analogy—“this is basically the Palm Pilot and we already have the iPhone.” Whether readers agree with the jab or not, the logic of his ETF call is straightforward: category leaders with crisp narratives tend to attract adviser due-diligence and model-portfolio allocations more quickly than platforms facing an expanding set of like-for-like competitors. The third leg of his thesis is demand-side. McClurg argues the bid for XRP exposure has been building for years and is ready to express through regulated wrappers as soon as they are available. He puts a number on it that will raise eyebrows: “I think XRP is $5 billion the first month … across the board,” he said, before making the explicit comparison—“out of the gate it’s definitely going to outperform what ETH did out of the gate.” Part of that confidence comes from what he sees as a different investor base composition. In his telling, financial advisers who now routinely pair a “big and safe” issuer with a crypto-native specialist will be comfortable adding XRP once the pathway is clear, and the online community already tracking the asset will finally have a mainstream channel that fits retirement accounts and institutional mandates. Why A XRP ETF May Be Imminent All of this presupposes one thing: that an XRP ETF can get to market in short order. On that timing, McClurg is unambiguous. Reacting to the end of Ripple’s litigation with the SEC, he said, “I absolutely believe that there’ll be an XRP ETF this year … it really is just a matter of time.” He then pointed to an underappreciated structural tailwind: the exchanges’ proposed “generic listing standards” for single-asset crypto ETFs. “There is a generic listing standard that was published in the last week by NASDAQ, New York Stock Exchange and Cboe … under the new generic listing standard … any token that has a futures market in the US on a CFTC-regulated exchange for more than 6 months does qualify,” he explained, while emphasizing the rule still sits in a public-comment phase. On that criterion, he added, “XRP has had a six-month futures market here in the next couple of months.” The implication is clear: once the standard is approved, multiple assets—including XRP—could move through the process in a batch, avoiding the bespoke rulemaking that slowed non-Bitcoin ETFs for years. McClurg also argues that XRP’s architecture—often criticized by crypto purists—is a feature, not a bug, for the buyers who matter most to ETF uptake. “I think that centralization actually works for certain industries,” he said, citing password resets, compliance stops and jurisdictional controls that banks and broker-dealers require in payments and tokenized securities workflows. “A more centralized framework for a blockchain actually makes a lot of sense,” he said, especially in countries with stringent financial-crime rules. That framing serves a practical ETF point: if the institutions who allocate through ETFs prefer systems that mirror existing controls, XRP’s DNA could ease adoption on trading desks and in risk committees where the first question is not throughput but operational and regulatory fit.

The rally has reignited the bull-vs-bear debate, with analysts split on where BTC heads next. Some believe the momentum will be enough to break through resistance and set fresh record highs, while others warn of a looming deeper correction if buying pressure falters. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Fundamentals Clash With Short-Term Leverage Risks Adding to the intrigue, key data from CryptoQuant shows that despite Bitcoin’s climb to this milestone, the Realized Profit and Loss (P&L) Ratio remains close to its historical average. This metric, which measures the magnitude of gains or losses realized by market participants, suggests the current uptrend is not yet in the overheated territory that often precedes sharp reversals. For bulls, this could indicate room for further upside without excessive risk of a rapid downturn. For bears, it’s a reminder that Bitcoin’s long-term trend remains intact but vulnerable to sudden shifts in sentiment. With volatility still defining the crypto landscape, the next moves around this level could shape Bitcoin’s trajectory for the rest of the year. Bitcoin Faces Pivotal Test As ATH Breakout or Rejection Looms According to top analyst Axel Adler, Bitcoin’s current market structure presents a much lower risk of a sharp trend reversal compared to previous peaks in the Realized Profit and Loss (P&L) Ratio. In past cycles, this metric often spiked to overheated levels before major pullbacks, signaling that market participants were taking excessive profits all at once. Today, however, the P&L Ratio remains closer to its average range, indicating a more balanced market environment despite Bitcoin trading just below its $123,000 all-time high. This suggests that while volatility remains a constant in the crypto space, the immediate probability of a dramatic downturn is lower than in past overheated phases. Still, Adler emphasizes that Bitcoin is entering a critical price range where market direction will be decided. Breaking above the all-time high is essential for the uptrend to continue, as such a move would likely trigger a new wave of momentum buying and potentially set the stage for fresh record highs. On the other hand, failing to clear this level—especially after multiple attempts—could result in a sharp correction or an extended period of sideways consolidation, testing investor patience. Other analysts highlight the contrast between Bitcoin’s strong long-term fundamentals and the current market indecision. On-chain data points to healthy accumulation trends, steady network activity, and relatively contained leverage in derivatives markets—all signs of underlying strength. Yet, uncertainty over macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and short-term profit-taking continues to weigh on sentiment.

On the 8-hour chart, BTC faced strong rejection near this resistance, pulling back to the $118,500 area. The recent move marks the second approach toward this level in the past three months, highlighting its importance as a critical breakout point. The chart also reveals that BTC remains above its key moving averages — the 50 SMA ($116,605), 100 SMA ($117,340), and 200 SMA ($112,019) — reinforcing the underlying bullish structure. The 50 SMA has recently crossed above the 100 SMA, a short-term bullish signal suggesting continued upward momentum if buyers can sustain pressure. Related Reading: Altseason Still On Hold – Metrics Reveal BTC Outpaces Large, Mid, Small Caps However, the failure to break above the $123K level could lead to renewed selling pressure, with potential retracements toward the 100 SMA or even the 200 SMA if momentum fades.

The consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.2% for the month on a seasonally adjusted basis and 2.7% from a year earlier. Economists had expected the same monthly gain but projected the yearly rate at 2.8%. The figures come as President Donald Trump’s tariffs showed only a limited impact on overall prices. The core CPI , which removes food and energy, advanced 0.3% in July and 3.1% over the past year. This matched the monthly forecast but topped the expected annual rate of 3%, making it the largest monthly rise since January. Federal Reserve policymakers often use the core measure to judge longer-term inflation patterns. Shelter and services prices lead monthly increases The BLS report showed shelter costs up 0.2%, making it a major driver of the monthly rise. Food prices stayed unchanged, while energy prices fell 1.1%. New vehicle prices, an area sensitive to tariffs, were flat, but used cars and trucks increased 0.5%. Transportation services and medical care services both jumped 0.8%. Some tariff effects appeared in other categories. Household furnishings and supplies rose 0.7% after a 1% increase in June. Apparel prices were barely higher at 0.1%, while core commodities moved up 0.2%. Prices for canned fruits and vegetables, which are often imported and exposed to tariffs, showed no change. Former White House economist Jared Bernstein said on CNBC that tariffs are present in the data but not yet creating major spikes. Bernstein served under former President Joe Biden and noted the current pace did not suggest extreme pricing pressures. The release comes during tensions between Trump and the BLS. Earlier in August, Trump removed the commissioner after a weaker-than-expected July nonfarm payrolls report. On Monday, he announced plans to nominate E.J. Antoni, a frequent critic of the bureau, as the next commissioner. Fed rate cut expectations climb after inflation data release Markets responded immediately to the CPI data, with CME Group’s FedWatch tool showing higher probabilities for interest rate cuts at the three remaining Federal Reserve meetings this year. The September meeting now carries a 91.8% chance of a cut compared to 85.9% a day earlier. October odds increased to 66.3% from 55.1%, and December to 56.7% from 45%. While headline inflation matched monthly forecasts and was slightly below annual estimates, the higher core reading drew attention. The 3.1% yearly core increase topped the consensus 3% and indicated that some underlying price pressures remain. On Wall Street, strategists reacted to the figures. Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo, global co-chief investment officer for multi-asset solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said the data supports the view that tariff impacts will be temporary. She pointed to companies managing costs through inventory drawdowns and cautious pricing to avoid alienating consumers. She said the numbers strengthen the case for a September rate cut. Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer at Regan Capital, said the July CPI was mild enough to give the Fed room to lower rates by 25 basis points in September, with the possibility of a 50 basis point cut. He cited the combination of the inflation data and the weak July jobs report as reasons for easing policy. Josh Jamner, senior investment strategy analyst at ClearBridge Investments, said the CPI’s alignment with expectations would not alter market views on a September cut, which had been largely priced in. He said the report should lift risk assets as traders unwind hedges taken to guard against a surprise price jump that never happened. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, compared the reaction to the CPI release to the question of whether a falling tree in a forest makes a sound if no one is there to hear it.

In a recent post on X, Papa shared a TradingView chart highlighting a breakout pattern, key Fibonacci extension levels, and a projected price path pointing toward the low double-digit range, approximately $12 to $14. Technical Setup Signals Potential Breakout XRP is currently trading at $3.14 after a period of sustained upward momentum. Papa’s chart analysis centers on a symmetrical triangle formation following a breakout from a multi-year downtrend. $XRP should start to move aggressively this week pic.twitter.com/h9BXnxGZRV — papa (@mamagucci) August 11, 2025 Such patterns typically indicate consolidation before a significant price move. The Fibonacci extension levels plotted on the chart outline potential upside targets, with the first major hurdle identified near $3.40 . If this resistance is breached on strong volume, historical price behavior suggests XRP could advance toward $5 in the short term, with room for extended gains in subsequent legs. The projected path in Papa’s analysis closely aligns with other bullish readings from technical analysts who are tracking similar consolidation structures and breakout conditions. Market Drivers Supporting the Bullish Case Two primary catalysts are strengthening the bullish outlook. First, the recent resolution of Ripple’s long-standing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has provided significant regulatory clarity, reducing a major overhang that has weighed on XRP for years. This has boosted investor confidence and attracted fresh capital inflows. Second, market liquidity and trading volumes have surged in recent weeks. On-chain data shows increased activity from both retail traders and institutional participants, with elevated exchange inflows signaling heightened market engagement. This rising participation, coupled with the strong technical setup, increases the probability of a sustained breakout rather than a short-lived rally. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Key Levels and Short-Term Risks While sentiment is overwhelmingly bullish, market observers caution that breakouts of this nature require confirmation. The immediate level to watch is $3.40, a zone that has acted as resistance in recent sessions. A decisive weekly close above this level, backed by a surge in trading volume, would add credibility to the upward trajectory outlined in Papa’s chart. However, profit-taking at higher levels, sudden shifts in institutional positioning, or large XRP releases from escrow could temporarily cap gains. Traders should remain attentive to volume trends, price stability above breakout levels, and on-chain movement of large holdings to gauge the sustainability of any rally. Outlook Papa’s projection of an imminent aggressive rally aligns with both the technical and fundamental backdrop currently supporting XRP. Should the token clear and hold above $3.40 with conviction, the door could open for a multi-stage advance toward the $12–$14 range, as indicated in his analysis. With legal uncertainties resolved and technical indicators converging, the coming days will be pivotal in determining whether XRP can transform its current consolidation into a historic price surge.

Western Union, a name synonymous with global money transfers for over 175 years, is reportedly exploring a groundbreaking venture: launching its very own Western Union stablecoin . This move signals a significant shift, as the remittance giant aims to step directly into the digital currency arena, potentially reshaping how cross-border payments are conducted worldwide. Why is Western Union Venturing into Dollar-Backed Stablecoins ? Western Union’s exploration of a dollar-backed stablecoin is a strategic response to the evolving landscape of global finance. For decades, this venerable institution has been a cornerstone of money movement, especially for individuals sending funds across borders. However, the rise of cryptocurrency projects has introduced new, often faster and cheaper, alternatives for international remittances. CEO Devin McGranahan highlighted the company’s focus on non-U.S. markets. Here, a dollar-backed digital asset could serve a dual purpose. It could function as a more efficient payment rail and offer a stable, dollar-denominated savings option in jurisdictions where local currencies might be volatile. This initiative positions Western Union to directly compete with crypto-native solutions that have gained traction in recent years. The Potential Impact on Cross-Border Payments The introduction of a Western Union stablecoin could bring several benefits to the often-costly world of cross-border payments . Imagine faster settlement times, potentially lower transaction fees, and greater transparency for users. This could be particularly impactful for communities reliant on remittances, enabling more of their hard-earned money to reach its destination. By leveraging its vast global network and trusted brand, Western Union could accelerate mainstream adoption of stablecoin technology. It would offer a familiar, regulated alternative to existing crypto solutions, appealing to a broader user base less comfortable with volatile cryptocurrencies. This initiative directly challenges the dominance of some decentralized finance (DeFi) projects in the remittance space. Navigating the Complexities of Remittance Services Despite the promising outlook, Western Union faces considerable challenges in deploying a new digital asset, especially within regulated remittance services . Regulatory frameworks for stablecoins are still developing globally, and compliance across numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions will be paramount. Each country has its own rules regarding digital assets, consumer protection, and anti-money laundering (AML) protocols. Ensuring widespread adoption also requires overcoming user inertia and building trust in a new digital product. Western Union’s long-standing reputation is an asset, but educating users about the benefits and security of a stablecoin will be crucial. Technical implementation, cybersecurity, and interoperability with existing financial systems also present significant hurdles that the company must address. The Future of Digital Currency Innovation Western Union’s foray into a stablecoin is more than just a business decision; it represents a significant moment for digital currency innovation . It signifies that even established, traditional financial institutions recognize the transformative potential of blockchain technology and digital assets. This move could inspire other legacy players to explore similar initiatives, accelerating the convergence of traditional finance and the crypto world. The evolution of global money transfers is clearly leaning towards digital solutions. Western Union, by embracing this technology, is attempting to secure its relevance in a rapidly changing landscape. Their success could pave the way for a new era of efficient, accessible, and stable digital payments, truly revolutionizing how money moves around the globe. Western Union’s exploration of a Western Union stablecoin is a bold and strategic step. It underscores the growing influence of digital currencies on global finance and the imperative for traditional players to adapt. If successful, this initiative could not only solidify Western Union’s position in the remittance market but also provide a powerful example of how established entities can innovate and thrive in the digital age. The future of global money movement is certainly looking more digital, and Western Union is clearly ready to play a significant role. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a dollar-backed stablecoin? A dollar-backed stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. This means that for every stablecoin issued, there is an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars held in reserve, providing stability. 2. Why is Western Union interested in stablecoins? Western Union is exploring stablecoins to enhance its cross-border payment services, reduce transaction costs, speed up transfers, and compete with newer cryptocurrency-based remittance solutions. It also aims to offer a stable, dollar-based savings option in certain non-U.S. markets. 3. Which markets will the Western Union stablecoin target? CEO Devin McGranahan indicated that the company is primarily focusing on non-U.S. markets, where a dollar-backed stablecoin could be particularly beneficial for both payments and savings. 4. How will this stablecoin compete with existing cryptocurrencies? By leveraging its trusted brand and extensive global network, Western Union’s stablecoin could offer a regulated and familiar alternative to more volatile cryptocurrencies, appealing to a broader user base for secure and efficient remittances. 5. What are the main challenges for Western Union in launching this stablecoin? Key challenges include navigating complex and evolving global regulatory frameworks for digital assets, ensuring widespread adoption and user trust, and overcoming technical hurdles related to security and interoperability with existing financial systems.

Community-Focused Their consensus model is a contribution-scored Proof of Work (PoW), rewarding on-chain activity rather than mere capital inflow. Over 1.2 million wallets have been created on the testnet, with Incentiv laying the foundations of a permissionless network that users benefit from the more they contribute. At the core of the its architecture is the Incentiv+ engine, a unified reward system that gathers portions of the value and fees from every transaction and places them into a communal Unified Reward Pool, which automatically distributes the rewards to network contributors. Compensation for participation is proportionally allocated to all users, regardless of whether they’re a miner, developer, liquidity provider, or engage in any other activity that benefits the ecosystem. This differs from traditional models such as fixed block rewards, as the payouts here are linked to economic throughput. To further catalyze the community-centric model, 26% of the total supply of the native token, $CENT, has been pre-loaded in a separate Community Rewards pool. This ensures that outsized rewards are available from day one, even before transaction volumes increase and transaction fees are taken into account. Moreover, a Short-Term Growth Fund is available for selective enhancement of key activities or strategic initiatives in the initial phase. This aligns strategically with Incentiv’s economic model, which is designed to transition from a subsidy-driven to a self-sustaining model through fees. Expanded Capabilities The public testnet, which launched earlier this year, has gained popularity in a short timeframe, underscoring the interest in the novel approach to value creation. Thousands of challenges have been completed, and over 1.7 billion testnet $TCENT tokens have been distributed. This reflects strong enthusiasm from developers and everyday users alike for the portfolio of products Incentiv offers, all grounded in Advanced Account Abstraction. Some other capabilities include: Unified token: flexible gas payments made possible by allowing fees in any supported token Passkey Wallets: passwordless, device-integrated, that improve security and the user experience Bundled Transactions: users can group multiple actions into a single signed transaction Native DEX: integrated decentralized exchange facilitating token swaps to cover fees or provide liquidity Open SDK: a toolkit for developers, allowing frictionless dApp sign-in, connecting users with Incentiv with just a few lines of code The post Incentiv Unveils Testnet Results, Future Plans, Community Rewards appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto News|DeFi News|Blockchain|DeFi,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY|SPONSORED|MINING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-08-12 14:11:08

Questo rialzo arriva in un momento di solidi fondamentali, tra cui un aumento dell’attività sulla rete, una crescente adozione da parte degli investitori istituzionali e riserve sui mercati di scambio ai minimi storici, segnale di un’offerta sempre più limitata che potrebbe spingere il prezzo ancora più in alto. I dati on-chain continuano a mostrare segnali positivi: le riserve di ETH sugli exchange sono scese a livelli mai visti prima, indicando che molte monete vengono spostate verso depositi a lungo termine o messe in staking, riducendo la liquidità disponibile per i trader. Questa contrazione dell’offerta, unita a una domanda solida, crea le condizioni per una possibile accelerazione del prezzo. A dare ulteriore slancio al mercato, l’analista di rilievo Ted Pillows ha rivelato che una misteriosa istituzione ha effettuato un nuovo acquisto massiccio, spendendo 212 milioni di dollari in ETH. Questo movimento si inserisce in una serie di acquisti importanti da parte di grandi investitori e istituzioni, consolidando la posizione di Ethereum come uno degli asset preferiti nel mondo delle criptovalute. Mysterious institution again bought $212,000,000 $ETH . They’ve accumulated $946,600,000 Ethereum last week. pic.twitter.com/Ji2vf3HCJ4 — Ted (@TedPillows) August 11, 2025 L’accumulo da parte delle “whale” spinge Ethereum verso un possibile nuovo rialzoSecondo i dati condivisi da Pillows, nelle ultime sette giorni le whale hanno accumulato Ethereum per un valore impressionante di 946,6 milioni di dollari. Questo aumento degli acquisti su larga scala sottolinea la crescente fiducia degli investitori più facoltosi, che sembrano posizionarsi in vista di quella che molti ritengono possa essere la prossima grande impennata di Ethereum. L’adozione da parte di istituzioni e aziende pubbliche continua a rafforzare questo scenario rialzista. Società quotate come SharpLink Gaming hanno annunciato acquisti significativi di ETH nell’ambito della loro strategia di tesoreria, segnalando fiducia nel valore a lungo termine di Ethereum . Queste mosse strategiche non solo riducono l’offerta disponibile, ma legittimano anche Ethereum come riserva di valore e come asset strategico per le imprese. Questo accumulo costante ha riacceso le speculazioni sui possibili target di prezzo. Gli analisti più prudenti, tenendo conto delle condizioni attuali del mercato e dei dati storici, vedono Ethereum poter raggiungere i 6.400 dollari nel medio termine. Nel frattempo, previsioni più ottimistiche — spinte da fondamentali solidi, adozione crescente della rete e flussi istituzionali — posizionano il potenziale rialzo di Ethereum oltre i 10.000 dollari. L’entità degli acquisti da parte delle whale, unita alla partecipazione aziendale, suggerisce che l’attuale rally non sia frutto solo di speculazioni a breve termine. Con le riserve sugli exchange ai minimi storici, la partecipazione allo staking in aumento e i wallet delle whale in crescita, l’offerta rimane molto limitata. Analisi Settimanale di Ethereum: Test sui Massimi Pluriennali Ethereum (ETH) continua a mostrare forza, scambiandosi a 4.211 dollari dopo aver raggiunto un picco di 4.350 dollari durante la settimana. Questo movimento segue una chiara rottura al rialzo della resistenza posta a 3.860 dollari, livello che in passato aveva più volte frenato il prezzo. Sul grafico settimanale, ETH si trova ora appena sotto la zona del massimo storico, segnalando una forte fiducia del mercato. La media mobile semplice a 50 settimane (SMA) si attesta a 2.767 dollari, ben al di sotto dei prezzi attuali, confermando un trend solido e una distanza significativa dalle zone di supporto di lungo termine. Il livello di 2.852 dollari rappresenta un altro supporto chiave, in linea con la SMA a 100 settimane, mentre la SMA a 200 settimane, a 2.441 dollari, indica la soglia di forza rialzista a lungo termine. I volumi sono aumentati durante la rottura, suggerendo che questo rally è sostenuto da un reale interesse all’acquisto e non da movimenti di prezzo dovuti a bassa liquidità. Tuttavia, avvicinandosi a una resistenza storicamente rilevante, potrebbe verificarsi una fase di consolidamento prima di un’eventuale rottura decisiva verso nuovi massimi. Se i compratori riusciranno a mantenere il controllo, il prossimo obiettivo sarà la scoperta di prezzi sopra i 4.400 dollari, con un potenziale rialzo fino a 5.000 dollari. Al ribasso, sarà fondamentale mantenere il supporto a 3.860 dollari per preservare la struttura rialzista ed evitare un ritracciamento più profondo.",Uncategorized|Ethereum,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-12 14:12:39
