The conversation between their aides temporarily paused the attacks that had gone viral across their social platforms. Trump hasn’t posted about Elon on Truth Social since the call, but officials in the White House say it’s not because he’s calm. The president is reportedly furious about how things played out online. “The future of their relationship is totally uncertain,” the same official said , adding that the tension hasn’t gone away, it’s just being held back by handlers. They’ve both pulled back, but not because they want to. It was damage control. Trump reacts to Epstein mention and claims about campaign money Trump was already pissed off, but Elon made it worse when he posted that the president appeared in the “Epstein files.” The post suggested a tie to Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender who’s been linked to several powerful men. Trump’s name has shown up in documents released in Epstein’s court cases, but there’s no charge or claim of any wrongdoing. That didn’t matter to Trump. He was livid that Elon even brought it up. Then came the part that really set him off. Elon claimed that Trump wouldn’t have won in November without him and said he gave more than $250 million in political support. Trump saw it as a personal attack. Elon posted on X, “Such ingratitude,” after taking credit for the election win. That hit a nerve. Trump hates when anyone tries to take credit for his success, especially someone he doesn’t fully trust. While the drama was playing out online, Trump and Republicans in Congress were working to pass a massive domestic spending bill. It’s the cornerstone of his second term. But Elon wasn’t impressed. He called the legislation a “MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK,” trashing it publicly while Trump was pushing hard behind the scenes. The president’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, responded by saying, “As President Trump has said himself, he is moving forward focused on passing the One Big Beautiful Bill.” White House pulled Musk’s NASA pick and meetings turned tense The relationship between the two billionaires started cracking before any of the public posts. Trump didn’t like Elon’s talk about DOGE and his overpromising about cutting government waste. Then came the real blow: the administration pulled the nomination of Jared Isaacman, Elon’s choice to lead NASA. That was one of the last things holding their uneasy alliance together. Behind that move was Sergio Gor, the White House personnel director. Gor and Elon have had issues for a while, and it boiled over after a March Cabinet meeting. At that meeting, Trump made it clear to his agency heads that they were in charge—not Elon, who was also in the room. That public statement didn’t sit well. Afterward, Elon refused to cooperate with Gor. His companies began laying off large numbers of people. Government staff started getting warnings from Musk-controlled entities, and those threats triggered lawsuits. Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers called him out. But Elon didn’t care. He kept pushing his agenda, firing staff and pressing forward. Trump isn’t used to opposition like this. Usually, when he fights, he wins. But Elon isn’t a regular opponent, he’s the richest man alive, and he has a platform that can match Trump’s media firepower. Some political operatives say Trump still has more influence. But no one denies that Elon has something no one else does, which is a megaphone that rivals the president’s.

The suspect, a French-Moroccan national, was reportedly found in possession of multiple bladed weapons and several mobile phones. Details of The Arrest According to a local media report , 24-year-old Badiss Mohamed Amide Bajjou was wanted by French authorities and the subject of a 2023 Interpol red notice. The announcement had been issued for charges related to the arrest, kidnapping, false imprisonment, or arbitrary detention of a hostage. At the request of French authorities, Morocco’s national police and intelligence service apprehended Bajjou in the northern Moroccan city of Tangier. The country’s General Directorate for National Security confirmed the operation in an official statement. “I sincerely thank Morocco for this arrest, which demonstrates the excellent judicial cooperation between our two countries, particularly against organized crime,” said French Minister of Justice Gérald Darmanin in a statement on X. Last week, French authorities also charged 25 people, including six minors, in connection with a series of kidnappings and attempted abductions in the region. In May, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau held an emergency meeting with crypto industry leaders. The ministry later announced plans to improve the safety of individuals involved in the sector. The new measures include giving priority access to police emergency lines, home security evaluations, and safety briefings from French law enforcement. Crypto-Linked Abductions France has recently experienced several kidnappings and failed attempts targeting crypto executives and their families. One of the most recent incidents occurred on May 13 in broad daylight. Attackers allegedly tried to abduct the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, CEO of French crypto platform Paymium. This followed two successful incidents where victims were later released with missing fingers. Also in May, the father of a French crypto millionaire was abducted in Paris while walking his dog. The victim was later held for several days before being freed after a ransom demand of $7.8 million. In January, David Balland, co-founder of crypto wallet provider Ledger, was forcefully taken from his home in central France during the early hours of January 21. The executive was then kept in captivity until a police operation on the night of January 22 led to his release. This case also involved a ransom of around $11.4 million.

So far, one of the best tokens that investors have identified is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi project built around its native token MUTM. The design of the project means that participants in the ecosystem, as well as MUTM token holders, stand to make massive gains in the upcoming cycle. Let us take a deep dive into the ecosystem and how it will support the long-term growth of MUTM tokens. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Ecosystem Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed as a decentralized, non-custodial ecosystem where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders, users can deposit funds into the protocol to earn interest. The interest they earn is based on the pool’s utilization rate and is designed to achieve maximum capital efficiency. As more borrowers join the protocol and take funds, the utilization rate rises. This increase leads to higher rates for both borrowers and lenders. When that happens, it pushes borrowers to pay back loans, while lenders are incentivized to deposit more funds to benefit from the higher yields. The result is a situation where the ecosystem naturally achieves equilibrium on its own. How Mutuum Finance Supports MUTM Tokens The MUTM token will be closely tied to the long-term growth of the ecosystem. As such, Mutuum Finance will take various measures to support its long-term growth. These measures will include purchasing MUTM tokens off the open market. As a result, it will boost buying pressure, helping to improve visibility of the entire ecosystem. When the tokens are bought off the open market, the team’s plan is to initially distribute most of them to the stakers contributing to the safety module. These distributions will incentivize more stakers to deposit their tokens, which will boost the protocol’s liquidity. Once they get past the initial stages, they plan to use the token purchases to support the long-term growth of the ecosystem. The support will include marketing activities, expanding the liquidity pools, and much more. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale And Giveaway Mutuum Finance is currently in the presale, which has been a massive success. So far, it has raised over $10.1 million from investors. There are currently over 11,700 investors who have secured their presale tokens. The presale is in phase 5, where tokens are going for $0.03, which marks a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will increase by 16.67% to $0.035. This stepped increase is a feature meant to ensure that the earliest buyers get the most rewards. On listing day, the tokens will launch at $0.06, which means current buyers stand to make a 100% ROI on their purchase. To further boost the rewards to its community, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has organized a massive $100,000 giveaway. In this giveaway, buyers of the MUTM presale tokens stand a chance to win $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. To be one of the 10 lucky winners that will receive this reward, all you need to do is purchase a minimum of $50 worth of MUTM tokens in the ongoing presale. The team has also organized a mini competition for presale buyers, where the top 50 participants will be eligible to receive bonus spot token drops. The leaderboard is available in the presale dashboard. For those who have a competitive streak, this is an opportunity to do something fun while being rewarded. What Sets Mutuum Finance Apart One of the reasons why the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is doing so well is due to the recent CertiK audit results. The project has been given a Token Scan Score of 80 on CertiK, which has led to a massive boost in trust. As such, even investors who were previously on the sidelines have been convinced, pouring millions of dollars’ worth of capital into the presale. This new stream of capital has seen the speed of the presale rise to new heights, with over 25% of the tokens set aside for the current presale already sold. This is impressive because the token sale launched barely a week ago. At this rate, Mutuum Finance will quickly move on to the next milestone in its roadmap, bringing the vision closer to life. The team revealed that they will launch a beta version of the platform on the day of the token listing. That is expected to cause a massive surge in new buyers, which will push the token price up by over 2000%. If you have been desperately searching for the next big buy opportunity before the next bull cycle, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers the best chance of success. Do not miss out on this exciting opportunity.

However, with the rapid ascent of Ruvi AI and its recent exchange partnerships, some are beginning to wonder if this emerging token could climb the ranks and rival BNB in terms of success. Ruvi AI’s unique focus, combined with growing investor interest, presents an intriguing opportunity for those looking to capitalize on a cutting-edge blockchain project with real-world impact. Binance Coin’s Proven Success BNB has achieved remarkable success as the native token of Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. Its strong utility within the Binance ecosystem, including discounted trading fees and use in Binance Smart Chain projects, has driven its demand and value. Yet, as BNB matures, the opportunity for meteoric growth lessens, leaving the door open for promising newcomers like Ruvi AI to shine. Ruvi AI’s Remarkable Growth Trajectory Ruvi AI has quickly gained traction, amassing an impressive $1.5 million during its presale and selling nearly 135 million tokens at a Phase 2 price of just $0.015 per token . This accessibility makes it an attractive entry point for both new and seasoned investors. Unlike speculative projects, Ruvi AI offers clarity and structured expectations. Its $0.07 valuation post-presale is part of a predefined plan, supporting investor confidence during this crucial stage. Analysts are optimistic, projecting a price of $1 per token post-listing , which would mark extraordinary growth and position Ruvi AI as a rising star in the crypto market. Real-World Applications Set Ruvi AI Apart What truly distinguishes Ruvi AI from its peers, including even BNB, is its integration of blockchain with artificial intelligence to address pressing issues across various industries. Practical, real-world applications solidify Ruvi AI as more than just a token; it’s a tool for transformation. Its potential use cases span: Healthcare : Revolutionizing diagnostics, streamlining patient care, and improving efficiency in medical systems. Logistics : Optimizing supply chains to cut costs and ensure smoother operations. Finance : Harnessing AI for fraud prevention and smarter data analytics to enhance transaction safety and transparency. This practical focus ensures scalability and sustained demand as industries increasingly integrate blockchain and AI technologies into their operations. Expanded Accessibility Through WEEX Exchange Partnership A critical milestone in Ruvi AI’s rise is its new partnership with WEEX Exchange , a move that highlights the project’s increasing credibility. This collaboration broadens Ruvi AI’s accessibility, allowing a global audience, from institutional investors to casual traders, to join its ecosystem. Partnerships like these not only lend legitimacy but also improve liquidity and create a more seamless user experience. For Ruvi AI, such alliances increase its visibility in the competitive crypto space, paving the way for more robust adoption. VIP Investment Tiers Offer Unmatched ROI One of Ruvi AI’s standout features is its VIP investment tier system , designed to reward early adopters with significant bonuses. The structured tiers provide clear growth projections for investors: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900 . Value at $1 per token: $70,000 . VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680 . Value at $1 per token: $224,000 . VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600 . Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000 . These tiers are a testament to Ruvi AI’s focus on delivering exceptional value, making it especially appealing to investors aiming for high returns. Could Ruvi AI Mimic Binance Coin’s Success? While Binance Coin’s dominance has been earned through years of ecosystem-building, Ruvi AI’s recent momentum signals its potential to carve out its own impactful presence. Its real-world utility , transparent growth strategy, and expanding accessibility thanks to partnerships like the one with WEEX, position it as an exciting contender in the crypto space. Ruvi AI offers investors the rare opportunity to get in early on a project with massive growth potential. If its projected trajectory holds true, it may soon join the ranks of crypto heavyweights like Binance Coin, redefining success and marking a new chapter in the world of blockchain innovation.

With the summer approaching, interest is heating up around their potential resurgence. This article delves into whether these renowned meme coins are positioned for a comeback. Curious minds will uncover which tokens might surge and steer the market in the coming months. The journey begins here. Shiba Inu Market Review: Recent Decline and Key Price Levels Insight Shiba Inu experienced notable declines over the recent month and last six months. SHIB dropped by approximately 12.65% over the last month, while registering a significant 53.87% decrease over the past six months. Price movements showed increased volatility with values oscillating between $0.0000108 and $0.0000162. Overall activity has been under downward pressure, reflecting a market that has struggled to sustain upward momentum. Traders have faced challenges due to rapid price shifts, leading to cautious sentiment. Current trading levels show the coin oscillating between a nearest resistance of $0.0000196 and a nearest support at $0.00000885, creating a clear trading range. Technical indicators exhibit bearish sentiment, with the Awesome Oscillator at -0.00000155 and the Momentum Indicator at -0.00000133. The RSI reading of 40.52 highlights selling pressure while hinting at possible oversold conditions. The market appears locked in a balance with limited higher highs or lower lows. Traders may consider placing buy orders near support and setting profit targets near resistance levels, while active risk management is crucial until a clearer market direction emerges. Dogecoin Price Update: Key Levels and Market Trends Dogecoin ’s price declined by roughly 7% over the past month, while it dropped nearly 56% over the last six months. Recent volatility highlights persistent downward pressure on the coin, reflecting a modest loss in the short term against a greater long-term decline. Moving averages and other indicators suggest that the long-term bearish trend remains intact despite some fluctuations in price. Current trading for Dogecoin sits between $0.1512 and $0.2470. The nearest resistance is at $0.3013, with additional resistance at $0.3971. Support is noted at $0.1097 and deeper support at $0.0139. The RSI near 40, combined with negative momentum, indicates bears have the upper hand. There is no clear trend, making trading ideas focused on risk management essential. Buyers may look to enter near support, while sellers could target resistance for potential exits. Conclusion SHIB and DOGE have shown resilience in the past and could see a resurgence this summer. Both coins have strong communities and significant media attention. Their future performance will depend on broader market trends and any upcoming technological developments. If the market turns bullish, SHIB and DOGE might lead the charge among meme coins. While past performance is not always a predictor of future results, these tokens have the potential to bounce back and capture interest once again.

But a new, large-scale survey conducted by the NCAA in partnership with the Harris Poll is providing a clearer picture of the American crypto holder. The study, described by Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, as “the largest ever study of crypto holders in America,” was designed to understand how deeply embedded digital assets are in daily American life. With responses reflecting behavior across all age groups, income levels, and professions, the findings challenge many of the most common preconceptions. Demographics Defy Stereotypes According to Alderoty, the results reveal that crypto “doesn’t have a type.” Ownership is widespread across diverse groups, with over 55 million adults in the U.S. reporting that they own or use cryptocurrency. This represents approximately one-fifth of the U.S. population. Stuart Alderoty on CNBC just made it clear: The biggest crypto study ever done in the U.S. points to one thing. $XRP isn’t just in the game. XRP is the headline. pic.twitter.com/gGqb4eZZvM — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) June 7, 2025 While XRP is popular among institutional investors , it is becoming common among retail holders. More people over 55 own crypto than those under 25, and nearly a third of all crypto holders are women. These findings suggest that digital assets have outgrown their early adopter phase and are now woven into the financial habits of everyday Americans. President Donald Trump recently declared that the U.S. is leading China in the crypto race . Employment data offers another unexpected insight into how Americans are investing in crypto. Alderoty pointed out that nearly as many crypto holders work in construction as in the tech industry. Furthermore, a significant portion of ownership exists outside the high-income brackets. The report notes that 26 percent of crypto-owning households earn less than $75,000 per year, backing the claim that digital assets are not reserved for the wealthy or the financial elite. This data shows that many people desire to build wealth through crypto, such as XRP. A recent Times Tabloid report highlighted XRP as a top contender for long-term investors . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Why This Survey Matters The study’s implications go beyond demographics. With ownership patterns now more clearly documented, the findings may influence how lawmakers and regulators approach crypto policy. Millions of working-class Americans use cryptocurrencies. Trump’s pro-crypto policies and appointees, such as SEC Chair Paul Atkins , could help shape the regulatory landscape to favor these investors.

In a market adjusting to tighter regulations and demand for on-chain utility, its emergence is timely, especially as platforms offering practical solutions become increasingly scarce. Among the top crypto coins to buy now, Qubetics is quickly carving its place as a leader in enterprise blockchain adoption. A wave of institutional recalibration followed the SEC’s May 2025 actions against multiple offshore exchanges, but instead of triggering panic, the shift spotlighted platforms capable of compliance and innovation. In this new environment, Aptos is making waves with major healthcare integrations and expansion into the Middle East, while SEI garners attention for ETF-linked ambitions and a focus on scalable, high-frequency transaction infrastructure. Together, Qubetics, Aptos, and SEI stand as some of the top crypto coins to buy now for users seeking functionality over hype, and long-term momentum over short-term noise. In the wake of uncertain regulations and fragmented ecosystems, these platforms offer alignment, access, and architecture designed to last. Qubetics: Building the Blockchain Backbone for Cross-Border Utility Qubetics has positioned itself as a bridge between enterprise-grade blockchain demand and real-life application. What separates it from many peers is a focus not only on Web3 ideals but on solving existing business problems — and it’s gaining traction with numbers to back it up. With 515 million tokens sold, over 27,500 holders, and $17.7 million raised, Qubetics has entered Stage 37 of its token sale with strong crypto presale momentum. Unlike projects built solely for DeFi or speculation, Qubetics is actively focused on enabling tokenization of real-world assets and cross-border smart contract deployment. Its QubeQode IDE gives developers plug-and-play tools to build dApps, payment routing systems, and decentralized identity frameworks without needing advanced coding backgrounds. Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace Qubetics has launched a tokenization marketplace where businesses can digitize everything from real estate to invoices. This platform is modular, interoperable, and legally structured to appeal to institutions operating across borders. By focusing on non-custodial infrastructure, Qubetics is bringing compliance-driven transparency without compromising decentralization. Cross-Border Transaction Utility Where Qubetics truly shines is in its Cross-Border Transaction Infrastructure. Traditional international payments are slow, expensive, and burdened by intermediaries. Qubetics solves this by enabling smart contract-based cross-border transfers with real-time currency conversion, automated tax rules, and programmable compliance checks. Each transaction routed through Qubetics undergoes a smart verification layer — validating sender/receiver credentials, asset type, and jurisdictional constraints. This allows companies to conduct international payroll, B2B settlements, and invoicing in minutes rather than days, all while meeting local legal standards. Built on a modular architecture, the platform also supports multi-currency interoperability, meaning companies operating in regions like North America, Europe, and Asia can transact natively with local digital currencies — all within one unified protocol. This frictionless capability, paired with its development toolset, positions Qubetics as a top crypto coin to buy now for entities looking to future-proof their financial operations on-chain. Why It’s Among the Top Crypto Coins to Buy Now Qubetics has raised over $17.7 million and distributed 515 million tokens in its 37th presale stage. With only 10M tokens left at $0.3370, this stage offers buyers a fixed 20% ROI at listing ($0.40). The protocol’s bold move to reduce total supply to 1.36B enhances scarcity, appealing to long-term crypto holders. Due to shifting global regulations, Qubetics also stands out for its modular compliance integrations and region-specific smart contract capabilities. As international firms seek secure and efficient blockchain platforms, Qubetics offers a polished alternative to bloated, gas-heavy networks. It’s fast becoming one of the top crypto coins to buy now due to utility-first engineering, growing adoption, and long-term development potential. Aptos Expands Its Middle East Influence with Enterprise Health Initiative Aptos took significant steps in 2025 to shift from a Layer-1 competitor into a global development ecosystem. The most recent move—a joint investment in Universal Health Token—has sparked attention in both blockchain and traditional markets. By merging blockchain with medical records and patient data security, Aptos is expanding beyond finance into real-world industries. Furthermore, Aptos recently opened a strategic office in Abu Dhabi, signaling its long-term intent to become a leader in Web3 infrastructure across the Middle East and North Africa. This move, aligned with rising GCC interest in blockchain and AI, places Aptos in the geopolitical center of next-generation tech investment. The project continues optimizing for developer flexibility with its Move programming language, which has drawn institutional interest due to its security-first architecture. Aptos-based dApps are beginning to find traction in financial, gaming, and data storage verticals, supported by ecosystem grants and partnerships. SEI Blockchain Eyes ETF Listings and Institutional Traction SEI has taken a different path in 2025 — one that leans heavily into high-frequency trading infrastructure and on-chain liquidity optimization. With talks circulating about ETF adoption frameworks involving SEI-based assets, the chain has seen renewed interest from institutional traders and DEX builders. SEI’s architecture is optimized for parallel transaction execution, giving it a technical advantage for order-book-based exchanges and synthetic asset platforms. This performance edge has allowed SEI to grow its total value locked (TVL) beyond $1.8 billion, a 12% increase in Q2 alone. Its speed, composability, and capital efficiency make SEI a compelling option in the top crypto coins to buy now — particularly for those eyeing growth in institutional DeFi and digital asset securitization. Final Verdict: Three Chains, One Common Goal — Scalable Real-World Value In an industry long dominated by hype cycles and technical jargon, a quiet transformation is taking place. Qubetics, Aptos, and SEI aren’t riding trends — they’re building infrastructure. For those scanning the market for top crypto coins to buy now , these three offer more than hope. They offer frameworks for actual, measurable impact. Qubetics stands out for its cross-border business tooling and real-world tokenization framework. Aptos proves its worth through health-tech breakthroughs and geopolitical strategy. SEI shows that speed and scale still matter — especially when paired with ETF opportunity. As the noise fades and utility rises, these three blockchains are becoming the top crypto coins to buy now — not just for short-term speculation but for the long-term value they’re actively engineering. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is Qubetics focused on in 2025?

Why is Qubetics considered one of the top crypto coins to buy now? Its enterprise-grade tools and real-world application make it a standout utility chain.

Per the Japanese newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun , senators approved several revisions to the Payment Services Act on June 6. Japanese Crypto Brokerages: Deregulation on The Way The revised act contains several crypto-related clauses. But arguably the most significant of these pertains to brokerages. The National Diet Building, in Tokyo, Japan. (Source: Kestrel [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Currently, brokerages need to apply to the regulatory Financial Services Agency (FSA) for operating permits. These permits are the same, highly restrictive, stringent licences required by crypto exchanges and wallet operators. The new amendment, however, creates a new legal category in the crypto sector called “intermediary businesses.” The regulatory barriers for this category will be much easier to overcome. And firms falling into this category will not have to adhere to the same level of regulatory compliance. The FSA and the government approved the new measures in March this year, submitting the amendments to the National Diet the same month. The bill passed the lower house without major opposition. Following its approval by the House of Councilors, the bill is now set to promulgate in June 2026. Japan will stick to its stance of seeking a review of all US tariffs in what could be the final ministerial-level talks ahead of a leaders’ summit this month https://t.co/oYmq2lX1Wm — Bloomberg (@business) June 5, 2025 Bill Will Create New Customer Safeguards, MPs Claim Lawmakers said the amendment was a response to the rapid rise of digital finance. They also said the bill would help boost customer protection and promote innovation throughout the country. Japanese media outlets claim that major businesses think the measures will significantly lower the barriers for gaming firms looking to move into the web3 and crypto spaces. The bill also allows the Prime Minister’s office to order individual crypto exchange operators to hold a portion of their assets in Japan. The exact amount may be specified by a Cabinet Order. This clause is a response to the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX in 2022. At the time of its bankruptcy, FTX operated the FTX Japan subsidiary, which was unable to access its overseas funds. This left users unable to withdraw their coins from the FTX Japan platform after the collapse. The new rules will also prevent overseas operators or subsidiaries from sending their funds overseas if they go bankrupt.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. BlackRock calls Quantum computers, with their ability to outperform classical binary computers and break traditional encryption, a threat to crypto . So surely BTC would price this in, as the threat of computers soon being able to break the encryption that enables the scarcity of bitcoin is an existential one. But on a recent CNBC appearance, Strategy's Michael Saylor downplayed quantum's threat to BTC, arguing that the Bitcoin protocol would implement a software upgrade – just like any other tech company – when the threat becomes imminent. ""It's mainly marketing from people that want to sell you the next quantum yo-yo token,"" Saylor said on CNBC. ""Google and Microsoft aren't going to sell you a computer that cracks modern cryptography because it would destroy Google and Microsoft – and the U.S. Government and the banking system."" Already, there are a number of proposals about how to secure Proof of Work against the quantum threat, including from BTQ , a startup building quantum-proof crypto hardware. One Bitcoin developer has put forward a draft Bitcoin Improvement Protocol that proposes a hard fork which would move everyone's wallets to quantum-secure addresses. ""Bitcoin is a protocol; the software gets upgraded every year,"" Saylor concluded, arguing that the bigger security threat for bitcoin is phishing. Saylor's view isn't a universal one, however. A recent report from Presto Research argued that the crypto industry is ""unprepared"" for the coming quantum threat. With BTC above $100K and the market getting ready to challenge another all-time high, traders just don't seem to be concerned. As CRCL has a Blockbuster IPO, the True Market Size of Stablecoins Remains a Mystery. Circle recently had a blockbuster initial public offering, and is set to open the U.S. trading week Monday at over $107 – an impressive rally over its opening price of $69. The number of stablecoins in circulation – the market cap of the asset category – is a well-known fact. Issuance can be seen on-chain after all, and that number comes in at $254 billion, according to CoinGecko data . But figuring out the volume of stablecoins used in payments is a little trickier. In a recent thread on X , Nic Carter, partner at Castle Island Ventures and the cofounder of blockchain data aggregator Coinmetrics, parsed through the available data and found that there's a huge discrepancy in the numbers. Estimating the genuine share of stablecoin transactions driven by payments rather than trading is complicated due to challenges like MEV bot interference, duplicative on-chain transactions, and spam activity designed purely to inflate metrics. Recent analyses illustrate this uncertainty starkly. A top-down heuristic from Visa and Allium estimates stablecoin transaction volumes at roughly $9 trillion annually as of May 2025. However, this figure broadly encompasses trading, DeFi activity, and settlements—not purely payments. In contrast, more detailed bottom-up analyses offer narrower but clearer insights. Fireblocks, a major custody provider, reported annual verified stablecoin payments of around $232 billion, compared with a significantly larger $2.12 trillion in trading volumes among its clients, suggesting that genuine payment transactions represent about 10% of their total stablecoin activity. Similarly, a targeted joint study by Artemis and Dragonfly sampled 20 stablecoin-focused payment providers directly. It calculated a conservative annualized payment volume of approximately $72.3 billion, acknowledging this as a probable undercount given limited sampling. In comparison to that $72.3 billion figure at the high end, Carter writes, is $232 billion, underscoring the substantial uncertainty around how extensively stablecoins are genuinely used as a payment mechanism. As for Circle, the stablecoin issuer doesn't provide a figure in its IPO filing on how much USDC is used for payments, only pointing to general transaction volume. News Roundup Coinbase, BiT Global Settle Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) Delisting Lawsuit BiT Global and Coinbase have settled their legal dispute over Coinbase's delisting of wrapped bitcoin (wBTC), CoinDesk previously reported . According to a joint court filing, BiT Global agreed to dismiss its lawsuit with prejudice—meaning the case cannot be refiled—and each company will cover its own legal costs. BiT Global initially sued Coinbase last year, claiming the delisting unfairly damaged wBTC's liquidity and reputation, while favoring Coinbase’s competing token, cbBTC. Coinbase cited concerns over crypto billionaire Justin Sun’s involvement with wBTC, labeling it an ""unacceptable risk,"" though specific settlement terms beyond the dismissal were not disclosed. Winklevoss Twins' Crypto Exchange Gemini Files Confidentially With SEC for IPO Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange and custody platform founded by billionaires Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has confidentially filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to go public, CoinDesk previously reported . The IPO details, including the size and valuation, remain undisclosed, but Gemini has already engaged Goldman Sachs and Citigroup as financial advisors, positioning itself prominently among crypto-native firms entering traditional markets. This filing follows the successful IPO of stablecoin issuer Circle, whose shares surged dramatically upon debuting on the New York Stock Exchange. Gemini's planned IPO represents a significant step for crypto companies seeking broader acceptance in mainstream finance, although the timing of the offering will depend on the SEC's review and market conditions. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin trades flat at $105,600.30 after recovering from an intraday dip, as miners' recent surge in exchange transfers signals potential volatility ahead. ETH: Ethereum held strong above critical $2,500 support amid volatility, closing bullishly near $2,534, as BlackRock's ETH ETF nears $5 billion on sustained institutional inflows. Gold: Gold trades slightly lower at $3,314.92 but heads for weekly gains, supported by weak U.S. jobs data despite easing U.S.-China tensions.

Meanwhile, Tron is steadily gaining traction with over 10 billion total transactions and daily activity crossing 8.4 million. The token has even surpassed Cardano in market cap, signaling a clear shift in market dynamics. While ETH and TRX continue to strengthen their footing, Unstaked is quietly rising as a contender among the top bullish crypto picks for 2025. With significant presale progress and upcoming AI tools set to launch after exchange listing, Unstaked is positioning itself for a breakout. Unstaked: Eyes on $5 with AI-Driven Utility What makes Unstaked stand out is its real use case, AI technology aligned with blockchain for practical automation. It’s not just talk. The team is building AI agents to support social activities on Telegram, X, and Discord for creators, DAOs, and Web3 users. These AI systems are set to go live only after exchange listings begin. As Unstaked sits in Stage 19, its price is $0.011065, and over 1.1 billion coins have been sold with total presale funds reaching $9.2 million. This growth points to strong user confidence. Rather than selling a vague AI idea, Unstaked is building a working product meant to ease the workload across online communities. With a listing price of $0.1819, early buyers are aiming for a possible 27x gain. But the broader target is $5, something many see as feasible due to its actual use case and growing demand. Among today’s top bullish crypto picks, Unstaked is grabbing attention with strong presale traction and a realistic roadmap. TRX 2025 Outlook: Strong Activity but Questions Remain Tron (TRX) has shown positive signals in 2025, with its price staying above $0.27. It recently surpassed Cardano in market cap, entering the top 9 globally. This jump comes from consistent user activity and stablecoin inflows. The platform has now logged over 10 billion transactions, with more than 8.4 million happening daily. Market sentiment is currently set to “Greed,” while volatility has slowed. Analysts predict TRX could soon hit $0.30, with a possible climb to $0.53 by year-end. With $379 million in daily trading and growing user engagement, TRX is building confidence. Even though it doesn’t always make headlines, its performance stats speak loudly. Ethereum Price Movement: ETF Support and Pectra Rollout Ethereum (ETH) is gaining strength again, hovering near $2,509. Recent ETF inflows and the Pectra upgrade have played key roles. May alone brought $564 million from spot ETFs, indicating strong institutional support. The May 7 Pectra update raised validator limits to 2,048 ETH, boosting efficiency and transaction speed. Network use remains above 50%, and Layer-2 protocols continue to drive activity. ETH holds a $302 billion market cap with $13.8 billion in daily volume. Experts now expect a short-term move to $2,541. With the Fear & Greed Index still showing “Greed,” ETH may keep climbing through Q3 as long as ETF momentum continues. Final Thoughts! Ethereum (ETH) and Tron (TRX) are both delivering noticeable performance in 2025. ETH is gaining on the back of its Pectra upgrade and ETF growth, while TRX maintains strength above $0.27 due to network activity and reduced volatility. Still, Unstaked could be the standout. With its price at $0.011065, 1.1 billion coins sold, and crypto presale funding now at $9.2 million, the numbers are speaking clearly. Its AI tools, set to activate post-listing, aim to serve real user needs daily. For those watching top bullish crypto options, Unstaked offers both momentum and a clear path forward. That $5 target may not be so far off.

The shift from speculation to real-world impact has created a clearer path for those searching for the most popular crypto options that could deliver in 2025 and beyond. While meme tokens and hype cycles may dominate headlines, names like BlockDAG, VeChain, Chainlink, and Ondo are drawing sustained interest due to their consistent development and growing utility. From enterprise adoption and data infrastructure to tokenized finance and mobile-powered mining, these four platforms represent different strategies with shared potential. BlockDAG (BDAG): From Mobile Miners to Market Momentum BlockDAG is emerging as a serious contender among the most popular crypto picks this year. With its June 13 Go Live reveal fast approaching, anticipation is building around upcoming updates expected to outline its exchange rollout, coin utility roadmap, and broader ecosystem plans. What makes BlockDAG particularly compelling is how aligned its development, user adoption, and financial traction have become. The X1 Miner app , which allows users to earn BDAG coins on mobile devices without traditional mining hardware, has already attracted more than 1.5 million users. This level of engagement demonstrates that BlockDAG’s concept of accessible mining is working and scaling. Financially, the numbers are just as impressive. Over $289 million has been raised through the presale, with more than 22 billion BDAG sold. Now in batch 28, the current presale price sits at $0.0018 until June 13, giving buyers a 2,520% return compared to batch 1. With proven demand, working tools, and a well-timed reveal, BlockDAG is transitioning from potential to performance, earning its place among the most popular crypto stories of 2025. VeChain (VET): Real Utility Through Enterprise Supply Chain Innovation VeChain continues to make its mark by focusing on one of the most practical use cases for blockchain: improving supply chain transparency. By helping companies verify products, track logistics, and ensure compliance, VeChain has become a go-to solution in industries ranging from pharmaceuticals to fashion. Its dual-token model, VET for value transfer and VTHO for transaction costs, adds efficiency to its blockchain while making it easier for enterprises to integrate without volatility concerns. Over the past year, VeChain has added new partnerships with global logistics providers and major retailers, reflecting ongoing adoption. For those evaluating the most popular crypto choices from a real-world integration standpoint, VeChain stands out. Its focus on traceability and authenticated data offers a compelling alternative to more speculative projects, especially as more industries digitize their operations and require tamper-proof systems. Chainlink (LINK): A Backbone for DeFi and Web3 Connectivity Chainlink is one of the foundational projects in the DeFi and Web3 space, known for its decentralized oracle network. By supplying smart contracts with off-chain data, including price feeds, market indexes, and weather data, Chainlink plays a critical role in ensuring these systems function accurately. More recently, Chainlink has expanded its scope with the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which enables smart contracts across different blockchains to communicate securely. This development has major implications for multichain applications and could become a central feature of future blockchain architecture. With new collaborations forming between Chainlink and major financial institutions, its position as a bridge between traditional data and blockchain applications continues to grow. As infrastructure plays become more important, Chainlink remains one of the most popular crypto platforms for developers and institutions alike. Ondo (ONDO): Bringing Real-World Financial Assets to the Blockchain Ondo is steadily gaining traction by addressing a growing demand in crypto; access to stable, yield-generating assets. Unlike many DeFi projects that rely on native tokens with variable rewards, Ondo provides blockchain-based exposure to tokenized real-world instruments like U.S. Treasuries and high-yield savings equivalents. This approach is attractive to users who want to benefit from blockchain efficiency without leaving behind the reliability of traditional finance. Ondo’s model focuses on compliance and structured access, making it particularly appealing for more risk-averse investors or those looking to diversify within the ecosystem. As tokenization becomes a leading theme in finance, Ondo is positioning itself as a key player. For anyone tracking the most popular crypto trends focused on bridging institutional and on-chain finance, this project is worth serious attention. Final Thoughts The distinction between hype-driven projects and meaningful crypto platforms is becoming more apparent. BlockDAG is pushing ahead with a working mobile miner and strong $289M crypto presale, VeChain is advancing blockchain’s enterprise use, Chainlink remains essential to Web3 infrastructure, and Ondo is redefining asset access on-chain. Together, these projects represent different angles of crypto’s future: accessibility, utility, connectivity, and integration. As interest shifts toward platforms with clear progress and purpose, these four are emerging among the most popular crypto options to watch in 2025, not just for what they might become, but for what they’re already building today.

According to people who know the matter, this top artificial intelligence startup provides data labeling services. Assuming this prospective dea l closes, it would also be Meta’s largest AI acquisition to date — and one of the largest funding rounds in recent history for a private company. The report said the deal terms were not yet finalized and could still change. Alexandr Wang urges congress to act fast on AI data strategy Just three months after DeepSeek sent waves through the global tech community with an AI model on par with America’s best, 28-year-old AI entrepreneur Alexandr Wang came before Congress with a sobering message: the US needs to move quickly to protect its edge. According to Wang, America needs to establish a “national AI data reserve,” supply enough power for data centers, and avoid an onerous patchwork of state-level rules. He said this at the April hearing, and lawmakers welcomed his feedback. “It’s good to see you again here in Washington,” Republican Representative Neal Dunn of Florida said. “You’re becoming a regular up here.” Wang is the CEO of Scale AI, a company quietly but powerfully shaping the future of artificial intelligence. While not as widely known as OpenAI’s Sam Altman , Wang has become a key figure in tech and policy circles. Scale AI provides foundational data-labeling services for companies like Meta and OpenAI, powering the training of AI models and helping businesses build custom AI applications. Initially known for labeling images for self-driving car models, Scale has since shifted toward curating the massive volumes of text data needed for large language models like ChatGPT. Today, Scale recruits highly educated professionals—PhDs, nurses, and legal experts—to develop sophisticated AI systems. “The three pillars of AI are chips, talent, and data,” said one person familiar with the company’s operations. “Scale dominates the data pillar.” Now, Scale’s influence is poised to grow dramatically with Meta’s multibillion-dollar investment in the company. Scale was last valued at $14 billion in 2024, with Meta already on its cap table. Scale AI adapts to AI’s next frontier with expert workforce Scale’s rise mirrors that of OpenAI in many ways. Both companies were founded roughly a decade ago, betting that the world was on the verge of an AI revolution. Wang and Altman, friends who once shared a home, have become influential figures in the AI conversation on Capitol Hill. Like OpenAI, Scale has drawn interest from major tech firms eager to invest in its future. However, the company’s journey hasn’t been without controversy. Scale has faced criticism for its reliance on low-paid contractors in countries like Kenya and the Philippines, who comb through massive amounts of online content—sometimes disturbing—to help train AI systems. Some workers have reported psychological distress from the nature of the material. In a 2019 interview with Bloomberg, Wang said the company’s contract workers earn “good” pay — “in the 60th to 70th percentile of wages in their geography.” According to company spokesperson Joe Osborne, a recent US Department of Labor investigation into Scale’s labor practices was dropped. As the industry shifts toward synthetic data for training AI, Scale is adapting. While synthetic data may reduce the need for some traditional labeling work, leading AI labs are still struggling to find enough high-quality data for training models capable of solving complex, human-level problems. In response, Scale is increasingly turning to well-compensated experts with advanced degrees to guide its models through a process called reinforcement learning—rewarding correct answers and penalizing incorrect ones. These experts craft challenging, domain-specific problems for AI models to solve, helping refine their capabilities in sensitive fields such as law and medicine. As of early 2025, 12% of these contributors had PhDs—many in fields like molecular biology—while more than 40% held master’s degrees, JDs, or MBAs. Much of Scale’s recent focus has been on helping companies develop AI tools for high-stakes applications like tax law, which varies across jurisdictions and requires nuanced understanding. This pivot is already paying off. Bloomberg reported that scale generated approximately $870 million in revenue in 2024 and is on track to more than double that to $2 billion in 2025. Interest in its expert workforce has surged since DeepSeek’s emergence as companies race to build models capable of human-like reasoning. Scale AI has also cemented its relationship with the US government, securing defense contracts and finding allies among policymakers wary of China’s AI ambitions. Wang, who is hawkish on China, has made deep connections on Capitol Hill. Meanwhile, former Scale executive Michael Kratsios advises President Donald Trump on AI policy. A closer match with Scale could help Meta fend off rivals like Google and OpenAI and deepen its connections to US defense and regulatory circles. For Scale, the transaction would draw a deep-pocketed ally — and a potential full-circle moment for Wang. In the early days of Scale, a venture capitalist once asked Wang when he knew he wanted to start a company. His answer? “I rattled off some silly answer about being inspired by The Social Network ,” he said, referencing the movie about Facebook’s founding. With Meta knocking on his door, that inspiration may finally come full circle. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

The project aims at enhancing AI skills among British workers and students. This came after the labor leader revealed plans to host an in-conversation event in London with tech billionaire Huang to inaugurate a deal that sees Nvidia assist in the UK to train more people in AI and push forward research at universities and the company’s AI lab in Bristol, west England. Starmer places technology and artificial intelligence at the center of his government’s plan to drive economic growth. Downing Street reveals eagerness to highlight its growth strategies instead of budget cuts At the beginning of a critical week in which the labor government will set out its usage plans to spend hundreds of billions over the time of the parliament, Starmer wants to highlight an optimistic outlook for technology and development. On the other hand, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves is coming under pressure from opposition parties and some of her own colleagues over anticipated cuts elsewhere. In her spending review, Reeves will focus first on the cherished but struggling National Health Service and the UK’s ability to project military power in the face of Russian aggression and the potential for diminished support from US President Donald Trump’s White House. She will also confirm big capital investment — which is not included within her fiscal rules — but day-to-day spending will be tight, with some departments facing real-terms cuts. Downing Street, eager to highlight its growth strategies instead of budget cuts, announced £86 billion worth $116 billion in funding for British science over the weekend. This funding will support pharmaceuticals, green energy, and military technology. The government noted that major tech companies such as IBM, QinetiQ, Microsoft, BT, and defense manufacturer BAE Systems are backing this initiative. Starmer hosted CEOs and investors—including Eric Schmidt and Demis Hassabis—this past weekend at Chequers, his countryside retreat, as part of its efforts to advance technology in the UK. UK PMs prioritize AI skills to achieve economic growth The UK is a global AI hub, leading Europe in AI startups funded for the first time and total private investment in AI through 2024. Additionally, the industry has been expanding rapidly and has been supported by more than $28 billion in private investment since 2013. Notably, investing in AI brings advantages to everyone in the UK. Keir Starmer’s vision for Britain to become an AI maker, not an AI taker, is set to be realized at London Tech Week. London Tech Week is scheduled to run from June 9th and end on June 13th. To mark the occasion, NVIDIA and some of Britain’s most innovative companies are coming together to host the first UK Sovereign AI Industry Forum. This brings together some of the UK’s most significant and forward-thinking businesses – including inaugural members Babcock, BAE Systems, BT, National Grid, and Standard Chartered – and enhances the security of the nation’s economy by rolling out AI infrastructure on sovereign soil and supercharging the growth of the UK’s AI startup ecosystem. Through its partnership with NVIDIA, the UK is developing sovereign computing infrastructure, investing in world-class leading research and skills, and promoting leadership in AI across all sectors. Peter Kyle, a Member of Parliament of the United Kingdom who has served as Secretary of State for Science, Innovation, and Technology since July 2024, commented on the topic of discussion. According to Kyle, they have ambitious goals for creating the next generation of AI advancements in the UK. Based on his argument, this will help them achieve the economic growth they need for their “Plan for Change” and keep their status as global leaders. Kyle further stated that ensuring they have the right infrastructure to support AI is a key part of this. He was pleased that NVIDIA is establishing the UK Sovereign AI Industry Forum. He added that this forum will unite top British companies to develop and implement these technologies across the UK, helping them to promote growth and create new opportunities.

45700501,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=742363,1749430800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45700501.jpeg,Mutuum Finance (MUTM): The DeFi Platform That Has Excited DOGE Investors,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/mutuum-finance-mutm-the-defi-platform-that-has-excited-doge-investors/,"Over the past two years, Dogecoin (DOGE) has captivated investors, which has led to hype-fueled growth. However, a new project in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space is turning the tide due to its promise of long-term growth. So far, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised over $10.1 million from eager crypto investors and shows no signs of slowing down. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale will not come as a surprise to keen observers of the crypto market. For a while now, investors have been making the switch from hype-driven projects to ones driven by long-term ecosystem growth. Mutuum Finance, which aims to bring innovative solutions to the Defi space, has demonstrated a strong value proposition that is pulling in more investors daily. Its design envisions an ecosystem where the native MUTM token is at the heart of a thriving ecosystem. The team has laid out a clear plan that will support the long-term growth of the MUTM token price while deepening liquidity in the DeFi protocol. DOGE Holders Are Exploring New Avenues For Growth DOGE, which is a well-known meme coin, lured in millions of investors globally with flashy branding and hype. However, many holders who bought into the hype have realized its long-term growth is not feasible. There are no clear plans to establish a thriving ecosystem like that on Mutuum Finance. As such, investors have been forced to sit back and watch as their holdings dwindle in value. This can be clearly seen in the price chart for DOGE, which shows the meme coin is down nearly 20% in the past week alone. Millions of disillusioned DOGE investors have been seriously looking for new avenues for growth, and quite a number have found their way to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). As the message continues to spread and the presale continues to hit new milestones, it is expected to trigger a wave of new buyers. Progress Of The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has been a resounding success so far, raising over $10.1 million from over 11,700 investors. Tokens in Phase 5 of the presale are going for $0.03, which is a massive 200% increase from the Phase 1 price of $0.01. However, the price increase has not stopped new buyers from joining the presale, as many still view it as a massive bargain, based on some of the analysts’ forecasts of 1300% gains. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price is set to rise another 16.67% to $0.035. That will see the expected ROI in the presale dip from the current 100% to 71.43%, based on the expected listing price of $0.06. Besides the massive utility that is expected for this project, the ongoing $100,000 giveaway has been another major catalyst. The project team plans to give ten lucky winners $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. To qualify for this giveaway, all that presale participants need to do is buy at least $50 worth of MUTM tokens. The giveaway, coupled with the expected 100% ROI, means that phase 5 buyers who qualify for the giveaway essentially have an opportunity to win $10k free. Mutuum Finance Protocol The Mutuum Finance protocol is a marvel of DeFi engineering that is expected to usher in a new era for the decentralized finance sector. On the protocol, users can participate as borrowers or lenders. Lenders can deposit funds into the protocol and earn interest. The interest rate they earn is based on the lending pool’s utilization rate. For borrowers, it presents an opportunity to deposit collateral and receive high-quality assets in return. One reason for borrowing is that a user can unlock the value of their assets without having to spend them. That way, when the value goes up, they can repay their loans and get back their assets. The mtToken Feature A unique feature of the protocol is the mtTokens. When a lender deposits funds in a pool, they receive mtTokens, which represent the value of their assets, plus any interest accrued. For instance, if a lender deposits $2,100 worth of BNB, they will receive mtBNB tokens on a 1:1 ratio to their deposit. One benefit of the mtTokens system is that lenders do not have to actively claim their gains. Instead, the protocol automatically adjusts the value of their mtTokens to reflect the interest accrued. This system also gives lenders instant access to the value of their assets. Since mtTokens are based on the ERC20 token standard, they can be traded freely on secondary exchanges. For instance, lenders can deposit their assets on Uniswap to unlock further market opportunities in real time. Mutuum Finance plans to establish mtToken pairs on decentralized exchanges to make this a reality. Sustainable MUTM Token Price Growth Mutuum Finance also plans to boost the price of MUTM tokens after launch through a program of buying and distributing tokens to stakers in the safety module. The program is designed to establish the long-term growth of the tokens, thereby providing a huge boost to the visibility of the protocol. That will cause more users to join, which will increase protocol profits, leading to a self-sustaining cycle of upward growth. From the above, Mutuum Finance is designed to ensure sustainable returns for its users and MUTM token holders. At the current low price of $0.03, you have an opportunity to join an ecosystem that can support long-term growth. This is an opportunity that you may regret missing in 2025.
