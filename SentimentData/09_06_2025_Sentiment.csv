The conversation between their aides temporarily paused the attacks that had gone viral across their social platforms. Trump hasn’t posted about Elon on Truth Social since the call, but officials in the White House say it’s not because he’s calm. The president is reportedly furious about how things played out online. “The future of their relationship is totally uncertain,” the same official said , adding that the tension hasn’t gone away, it’s just being held back by handlers. They’ve both pulled back, but not because they want to. It was damage control. Trump reacts to Epstein mention and claims about campaign money Trump was already pissed off, but Elon made it worse when he posted that the president appeared in the “Epstein files.” The post suggested a tie to Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender who’s been linked to several powerful men. Trump’s name has shown up in documents released in Epstein’s court cases, but there’s no charge or claim of any wrongdoing. That didn’t matter to Trump. He was livid that Elon even brought it up. Then came the part that really set him off. Elon claimed that Trump wouldn’t have won in November without him and said he gave more than $250 million in political support. Trump saw it as a personal attack. Elon posted on X, “Such ingratitude,” after taking credit for the election win. That hit a nerve. Trump hates when anyone tries to take credit for his success, especially someone he doesn’t fully trust. While the drama was playing out online, Trump and Republicans in Congress were working to pass a massive domestic spending bill. It’s the cornerstone of his second term. But Elon wasn’t impressed. He called the legislation a “MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK,” trashing it publicly while Trump was pushing hard behind the scenes. The president’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, responded by saying, “As President Trump has said himself, he is moving forward focused on passing the One Big Beautiful Bill.” White House pulled Musk’s NASA pick and meetings turned tense The relationship between the two billionaires started cracking before any of the public posts. Trump didn’t like Elon’s talk about DOGE and his overpromising about cutting government waste. Then came the real blow: the administration pulled the nomination of Jared Isaacman, Elon’s choice to lead NASA. That was one of the last things holding their uneasy alliance together. Behind that move was Sergio Gor, the White House personnel director. Gor and Elon have had issues for a while, and it boiled over after a March Cabinet meeting. At that meeting, Trump made it clear to his agency heads that they were in charge—not Elon, who was also in the room. That public statement didn’t sit well. Afterward, Elon refused to cooperate with Gor. His companies began laying off large numbers of people. Government staff started getting warnings from Musk-controlled entities, and those threats triggered lawsuits. Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers called him out. But Elon didn’t care. He kept pushing his agenda, firing staff and pressing forward. Trump isn’t used to opposition like this. Usually, when he fights, he wins. But Elon isn’t a regular opponent, he’s the richest man alive, and he has a platform that can match Trump’s media firepower. Some political operatives say Trump still has more influence. But no one denies that Elon has something no one else does, which is a megaphone that rivals the president’s.

The suspect, a French-Moroccan national, was reportedly found in possession of multiple bladed weapons and several mobile phones. Details of The Arrest According to a local media report , 24-year-old Badiss Mohamed Amide Bajjou was wanted by French authorities and the subject of a 2023 Interpol red notice. The announcement had been issued for charges related to the arrest, kidnapping, false imprisonment, or arbitrary detention of a hostage. At the request of French authorities, Morocco’s national police and intelligence service apprehended Bajjou in the northern Moroccan city of Tangier. The country’s General Directorate for National Security confirmed the operation in an official statement. “I sincerely thank Morocco for this arrest, which demonstrates the excellent judicial cooperation between our two countries, particularly against organized crime,” said French Minister of Justice Gérald Darmanin in a statement on X. Last week, French authorities also charged 25 people, including six minors, in connection with a series of kidnappings and attempted abductions in the region. In May, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau held an emergency meeting with crypto industry leaders. The ministry later announced plans to improve the safety of individuals involved in the sector. The new measures include giving priority access to police emergency lines, home security evaluations, and safety briefings from French law enforcement. Crypto-Linked Abductions France has recently experienced several kidnappings and failed attempts targeting crypto executives and their families. One of the most recent incidents occurred on May 13 in broad daylight. Attackers allegedly tried to abduct the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, CEO of French crypto platform Paymium. This followed two successful incidents where victims were later released with missing fingers. Also in May, the father of a French crypto millionaire was abducted in Paris while walking his dog. The victim was later held for several days before being freed after a ransom demand of $7.8 million. In January, David Balland, co-founder of crypto wallet provider Ledger, was forcefully taken from his home in central France during the early hours of January 21. The executive was then kept in captivity until a police operation on the night of January 22 led to his release. This case also involved a ransom of around $11.4 million.

So far, one of the best tokens that investors have identified is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi project built around its native token MUTM. The design of the project means that participants in the ecosystem, as well as MUTM token holders, stand to make massive gains in the upcoming cycle. Let us take a deep dive into the ecosystem and how it will support the long-term growth of MUTM tokens. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Ecosystem Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed as a decentralized, non-custodial ecosystem where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders, users can deposit funds into the protocol to earn interest. The interest they earn is based on the pool’s utilization rate and is designed to achieve maximum capital efficiency. As more borrowers join the protocol and take funds, the utilization rate rises. This increase leads to higher rates for both borrowers and lenders. When that happens, it pushes borrowers to pay back loans, while lenders are incentivized to deposit more funds to benefit from the higher yields. The result is a situation where the ecosystem naturally achieves equilibrium on its own. How Mutuum Finance Supports MUTM Tokens The MUTM token will be closely tied to the long-term growth of the ecosystem. As such, Mutuum Finance will take various measures to support its long-term growth. These measures will include purchasing MUTM tokens off the open market. As a result, it will boost buying pressure, helping to improve visibility of the entire ecosystem. When the tokens are bought off the open market, the team’s plan is to initially distribute most of them to the stakers contributing to the safety module. These distributions will incentivize more stakers to deposit their tokens, which will boost the protocol’s liquidity. Once they get past the initial stages, they plan to use the token purchases to support the long-term growth of the ecosystem. The support will include marketing activities, expanding the liquidity pools, and much more. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale And Giveaway Mutuum Finance is currently in the presale, which has been a massive success. So far, it has raised over $10.1 million from investors. There are currently over 11,700 investors who have secured their presale tokens. The presale is in phase 5, where tokens are going for $0.03, which marks a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will increase by 16.67% to $0.035. This stepped increase is a feature meant to ensure that the earliest buyers get the most rewards. On listing day, the tokens will launch at $0.06, which means current buyers stand to make a 100% ROI on their purchase. To further boost the rewards to its community, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has organized a massive $100,000 giveaway. In this giveaway, buyers of the MUTM presale tokens stand a chance to win $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. To be one of the 10 lucky winners that will receive this reward, all you need to do is purchase a minimum of $50 worth of MUTM tokens in the ongoing presale. The team has also organized a mini competition for presale buyers, where the top 50 participants will be eligible to receive bonus spot token drops. The leaderboard is available in the presale dashboard. For those who have a competitive streak, this is an opportunity to do something fun while being rewarded. What Sets Mutuum Finance Apart One of the reasons why the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is doing so well is due to the recent CertiK audit results. The project has been given a Token Scan Score of 80 on CertiK, which has led to a massive boost in trust. As such, even investors who were previously on the sidelines have been convinced, pouring millions of dollars’ worth of capital into the presale. This new stream of capital has seen the speed of the presale rise to new heights, with over 25% of the tokens set aside for the current presale already sold. This is impressive because the token sale launched barely a week ago. At this rate, Mutuum Finance will quickly move on to the next milestone in its roadmap, bringing the vision closer to life. The team revealed that they will launch a beta version of the platform on the day of the token listing. That is expected to cause a massive surge in new buyers, which will push the token price up by over 2000%. If you have been desperately searching for the next big buy opportunity before the next bull cycle, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers the best chance of success. Do not miss out on this exciting opportunity.

However, with the rapid ascent of Ruvi AI and its recent exchange partnerships, some are beginning to wonder if this emerging token could climb the ranks and rival BNB in terms of success. Ruvi AI’s unique focus, combined with growing investor interest, presents an intriguing opportunity for those looking to capitalize on a cutting-edge blockchain project with real-world impact. Binance Coin’s Proven Success BNB has achieved remarkable success as the native token of Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. Its strong utility within the Binance ecosystem, including discounted trading fees and use in Binance Smart Chain projects, has driven its demand and value. Yet, as BNB matures, the opportunity for meteoric growth lessens, leaving the door open for promising newcomers like Ruvi AI to shine. Ruvi AI’s Remarkable Growth Trajectory Ruvi AI has quickly gained traction, amassing an impressive $1.5 million during its presale and selling nearly 135 million tokens at a Phase 2 price of just $0.015 per token . This accessibility makes it an attractive entry point for both new and seasoned investors. Unlike speculative projects, Ruvi AI offers clarity and structured expectations. Its $0.07 valuation post-presale is part of a predefined plan, supporting investor confidence during this crucial stage. Analysts are optimistic, projecting a price of $1 per token post-listing , which would mark extraordinary growth and position Ruvi AI as a rising star in the crypto market. Real-World Applications Set Ruvi AI Apart What truly distinguishes Ruvi AI from its peers, including even BNB, is its integration of blockchain with artificial intelligence to address pressing issues across various industries. Practical, real-world applications solidify Ruvi AI as more than just a token; it’s a tool for transformation. Its potential use cases span: Healthcare : Revolutionizing diagnostics, streamlining patient care, and improving efficiency in medical systems. Logistics : Optimizing supply chains to cut costs and ensure smoother operations. Finance : Harnessing AI for fraud prevention and smarter data analytics to enhance transaction safety and transparency. This practical focus ensures scalability and sustained demand as industries increasingly integrate blockchain and AI technologies into their operations. Expanded Accessibility Through WEEX Exchange Partnership A critical milestone in Ruvi AI’s rise is its new partnership with WEEX Exchange , a move that highlights the project’s increasing credibility. This collaboration broadens Ruvi AI’s accessibility, allowing a global audience, from institutional investors to casual traders, to join its ecosystem. Partnerships like these not only lend legitimacy but also improve liquidity and create a more seamless user experience. For Ruvi AI, such alliances increase its visibility in the competitive crypto space, paving the way for more robust adoption. VIP Investment Tiers Offer Unmatched ROI One of Ruvi AI’s standout features is its VIP investment tier system , designed to reward early adopters with significant bonuses. The structured tiers provide clear growth projections for investors: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900 . Value at $1 per token: $70,000 . VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680 . Value at $1 per token: $224,000 . VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600 . Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000 . These tiers are a testament to Ruvi AI’s focus on delivering exceptional value, making it especially appealing to investors aiming for high returns. Could Ruvi AI Mimic Binance Coin’s Success? While Binance Coin’s dominance has been earned through years of ecosystem-building, Ruvi AI’s recent momentum signals its potential to carve out its own impactful presence. Its real-world utility , transparent growth strategy, and expanding accessibility thanks to partnerships like the one with WEEX, position it as an exciting contender in the crypto space. Ruvi AI offers investors the rare opportunity to get in early on a project with massive growth potential. If its projected trajectory holds true, it may soon join the ranks of crypto heavyweights like Binance Coin, redefining success and marking a new chapter in the world of blockchain innovation.

With the summer approaching, interest is heating up around their potential resurgence. This article delves into whether these renowned meme coins are positioned for a comeback. Curious minds will uncover which tokens might surge and steer the market in the coming months. The journey begins here. Shiba Inu Market Review: Recent Decline and Key Price Levels Insight Shiba Inu experienced notable declines over the recent month and last six months. SHIB dropped by approximately 12.65% over the last month, while registering a significant 53.87% decrease over the past six months. Price movements showed increased volatility with values oscillating between $0.0000108 and $0.0000162. Overall activity has been under downward pressure, reflecting a market that has struggled to sustain upward momentum. Traders have faced challenges due to rapid price shifts, leading to cautious sentiment. Current trading levels show the coin oscillating between a nearest resistance of $0.0000196 and a nearest support at $0.00000885, creating a clear trading range. Technical indicators exhibit bearish sentiment, with the Awesome Oscillator at -0.00000155 and the Momentum Indicator at -0.00000133. The RSI reading of 40.52 highlights selling pressure while hinting at possible oversold conditions. The market appears locked in a balance with limited higher highs or lower lows. Traders may consider placing buy orders near support and setting profit targets near resistance levels, while active risk management is crucial until a clearer market direction emerges. Dogecoin Price Update: Key Levels and Market Trends Dogecoin ’s price declined by roughly 7% over the past month, while it dropped nearly 56% over the last six months. Recent volatility highlights persistent downward pressure on the coin, reflecting a modest loss in the short term against a greater long-term decline. Moving averages and other indicators suggest that the long-term bearish trend remains intact despite some fluctuations in price. Current trading for Dogecoin sits between $0.1512 and $0.2470. The nearest resistance is at $0.3013, with additional resistance at $0.3971. Support is noted at $0.1097 and deeper support at $0.0139. The RSI near 40, combined with negative momentum, indicates bears have the upper hand. There is no clear trend, making trading ideas focused on risk management essential. Buyers may look to enter near support, while sellers could target resistance for potential exits. Conclusion SHIB and DOGE have shown resilience in the past and could see a resurgence this summer. Both coins have strong communities and significant media attention. Their future performance will depend on broader market trends and any upcoming technological developments. If the market turns bullish, SHIB and DOGE might lead the charge among meme coins. While past performance is not always a predictor of future results, these tokens have the potential to bounce back and capture interest once again.

But a new, large-scale survey conducted by the NCAA in partnership with the Harris Poll is providing a clearer picture of the American crypto holder. The study, described by Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, as “the largest ever study of crypto holders in America,” was designed to understand how deeply embedded digital assets are in daily American life. With responses reflecting behavior across all age groups, income levels, and professions, the findings challenge many of the most common preconceptions. Demographics Defy Stereotypes According to Alderoty, the results reveal that crypto “doesn’t have a type.” Ownership is widespread across diverse groups, with over 55 million adults in the U.S. reporting that they own or use cryptocurrency. This represents approximately one-fifth of the U.S. population. Stuart Alderoty on CNBC just made it clear: The biggest crypto study ever done in the U.S. points to one thing. $XRP isn’t just in the game. XRP is the headline. pic.twitter.com/gGqb4eZZvM — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) June 7, 2025 While XRP is popular among institutional investors , it is becoming common among retail holders. More people over 55 own crypto than those under 25, and nearly a third of all crypto holders are women. These findings suggest that digital assets have outgrown their early adopter phase and are now woven into the financial habits of everyday Americans. President Donald Trump recently declared that the U.S. is leading China in the crypto race . Employment data offers another unexpected insight into how Americans are investing in crypto. Alderoty pointed out that nearly as many crypto holders work in construction as in the tech industry. Furthermore, a significant portion of ownership exists outside the high-income brackets. The report notes that 26 percent of crypto-owning households earn less than $75,000 per year, backing the claim that digital assets are not reserved for the wealthy or the financial elite. This data shows that many people desire to build wealth through crypto, such as XRP. A recent Times Tabloid report highlighted XRP as a top contender for long-term investors . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Why This Survey Matters The study’s implications go beyond demographics. With ownership patterns now more clearly documented, the findings may influence how lawmakers and regulators approach crypto policy. Millions of working-class Americans use cryptocurrencies. Trump’s pro-crypto policies and appointees, such as SEC Chair Paul Atkins , could help shape the regulatory landscape to favor these investors.

In a market adjusting to tighter regulations and demand for on-chain utility, its emergence is timely, especially as platforms offering practical solutions become increasingly scarce. Among the top crypto coins to buy now, Qubetics is quickly carving its place as a leader in enterprise blockchain adoption. A wave of institutional recalibration followed the SEC’s May 2025 actions against multiple offshore exchanges, but instead of triggering panic, the shift spotlighted platforms capable of compliance and innovation. In this new environment, Aptos is making waves with major healthcare integrations and expansion into the Middle East, while SEI garners attention for ETF-linked ambitions and a focus on scalable, high-frequency transaction infrastructure. Together, Qubetics, Aptos, and SEI stand as some of the top crypto coins to buy now for users seeking functionality over hype, and long-term momentum over short-term noise. In the wake of uncertain regulations and fragmented ecosystems, these platforms offer alignment, access, and architecture designed to last. Qubetics: Building the Blockchain Backbone for Cross-Border Utility Qubetics has positioned itself as a bridge between enterprise-grade blockchain demand and real-life application. What separates it from many peers is a focus not only on Web3 ideals but on solving existing business problems — and it’s gaining traction with numbers to back it up. With 515 million tokens sold, over 27,500 holders, and $17.7 million raised, Qubetics has entered Stage 37 of its token sale with strong crypto presale momentum. Unlike projects built solely for DeFi or speculation, Qubetics is actively focused on enabling tokenization of real-world assets and cross-border smart contract deployment. Its QubeQode IDE gives developers plug-and-play tools to build dApps, payment routing systems, and decentralized identity frameworks without needing advanced coding backgrounds. Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace Qubetics has launched a tokenization marketplace where businesses can digitize everything from real estate to invoices. This platform is modular, interoperable, and legally structured to appeal to institutions operating across borders. By focusing on non-custodial infrastructure, Qubetics is bringing compliance-driven transparency without compromising decentralization. Cross-Border Transaction Utility Where Qubetics truly shines is in its Cross-Border Transaction Infrastructure. Traditional international payments are slow, expensive, and burdened by intermediaries. Qubetics solves this by enabling smart contract-based cross-border transfers with real-time currency conversion, automated tax rules, and programmable compliance checks. Each transaction routed through Qubetics undergoes a smart verification layer — validating sender/receiver credentials, asset type, and jurisdictional constraints. This allows companies to conduct international payroll, B2B settlements, and invoicing in minutes rather than days, all while meeting local legal standards. Built on a modular architecture, the platform also supports multi-currency interoperability, meaning companies operating in regions like North America, Europe, and Asia can transact natively with local digital currencies — all within one unified protocol. This frictionless capability, paired with its development toolset, positions Qubetics as a top crypto coin to buy now for entities looking to future-proof their financial operations on-chain. Why It’s Among the Top Crypto Coins to Buy Now Qubetics has raised over $17.7 million and distributed 515 million tokens in its 37th presale stage. With only 10M tokens left at $0.3370, this stage offers buyers a fixed 20% ROI at listing ($0.40). The protocol’s bold move to reduce total supply to 1.36B enhances scarcity, appealing to long-term crypto holders. Due to shifting global regulations, Qubetics also stands out for its modular compliance integrations and region-specific smart contract capabilities. As international firms seek secure and efficient blockchain platforms, Qubetics offers a polished alternative to bloated, gas-heavy networks. It’s fast becoming one of the top crypto coins to buy now due to utility-first engineering, growing adoption, and long-term development potential. Aptos Expands Its Middle East Influence with Enterprise Health Initiative Aptos took significant steps in 2025 to shift from a Layer-1 competitor into a global development ecosystem. The most recent move—a joint investment in Universal Health Token—has sparked attention in both blockchain and traditional markets. By merging blockchain with medical records and patient data security, Aptos is expanding beyond finance into real-world industries. Furthermore, Aptos recently opened a strategic office in Abu Dhabi, signaling its long-term intent to become a leader in Web3 infrastructure across the Middle East and North Africa. This move, aligned with rising GCC interest in blockchain and AI, places Aptos in the geopolitical center of next-generation tech investment. The project continues optimizing for developer flexibility with its Move programming language, which has drawn institutional interest due to its security-first architecture. Aptos-based dApps are beginning to find traction in financial, gaming, and data storage verticals, supported by ecosystem grants and partnerships. SEI Blockchain Eyes ETF Listings and Institutional Traction SEI has taken a different path in 2025 — one that leans heavily into high-frequency trading infrastructure and on-chain liquidity optimization. With talks circulating about ETF adoption frameworks involving SEI-based assets, the chain has seen renewed interest from institutional traders and DEX builders. SEI’s architecture is optimized for parallel transaction execution, giving it a technical advantage for order-book-based exchanges and synthetic asset platforms. This performance edge has allowed SEI to grow its total value locked (TVL) beyond $1.8 billion, a 12% increase in Q2 alone. Its speed, composability, and capital efficiency make SEI a compelling option in the top crypto coins to buy now — particularly for those eyeing growth in institutional DeFi and digital asset securitization. Final Verdict: Three Chains, One Common Goal — Scalable Real-World Value In an industry long dominated by hype cycles and technical jargon, a quiet transformation is taking place. Qubetics, Aptos, and SEI aren’t riding trends — they’re building infrastructure. For those scanning the market for top crypto coins to buy now , these three offer more than hope. They offer frameworks for actual, measurable impact. Qubetics stands out for its cross-border business tooling and real-world tokenization framework. Aptos proves its worth through health-tech breakthroughs and geopolitical strategy. SEI shows that speed and scale still matter — especially when paired with ETF opportunity. As the noise fades and utility rises, these three blockchains are becoming the top crypto coins to buy now — not just for short-term speculation but for the long-term value they’re actively engineering. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is Qubetics focused on in 2025?

Why is Qubetics considered one of the top crypto coins to buy now? Its enterprise-grade tools and real-world application make it a standout utility chain.

Per the Japanese newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun , senators approved several revisions to the Payment Services Act on June 6. Japanese Crypto Brokerages: Deregulation on The Way The revised act contains several crypto-related clauses. But arguably the most significant of these pertains to brokerages. The National Diet Building, in Tokyo, Japan. (Source: Kestrel [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Currently, brokerages need to apply to the regulatory Financial Services Agency (FSA) for operating permits. These permits are the same, highly restrictive, stringent licences required by crypto exchanges and wallet operators. The new amendment, however, creates a new legal category in the crypto sector called “intermediary businesses.” The regulatory barriers for this category will be much easier to overcome. And firms falling into this category will not have to adhere to the same level of regulatory compliance. The FSA and the government approved the new measures in March this year, submitting the amendments to the National Diet the same month. The bill passed the lower house without major opposition. Following its approval by the House of Councilors, the bill is now set to promulgate in June 2026. Japan will stick to its stance of seeking a review of all US tariffs in what could be the final ministerial-level talks ahead of a leaders’ summit this month https://t.co/oYmq2lX1Wm — Bloomberg (@business) June 5, 2025 Bill Will Create New Customer Safeguards, MPs Claim Lawmakers said the amendment was a response to the rapid rise of digital finance. They also said the bill would help boost customer protection and promote innovation throughout the country. Japanese media outlets claim that major businesses think the measures will significantly lower the barriers for gaming firms looking to move into the web3 and crypto spaces. The bill also allows the Prime Minister’s office to order individual crypto exchange operators to hold a portion of their assets in Japan. The exact amount may be specified by a Cabinet Order. This clause is a response to the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX in 2022. At the time of its bankruptcy, FTX operated the FTX Japan subsidiary, which was unable to access its overseas funds. This left users unable to withdraw their coins from the FTX Japan platform after the collapse. The new rules will also prevent overseas operators or subsidiaries from sending their funds overseas if they go bankrupt.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. BlackRock calls Quantum computers, with their ability to outperform classical binary computers and break traditional encryption, a threat to crypto . So surely BTC would price this in, as the threat of computers soon being able to break the encryption that enables the scarcity of bitcoin is an existential one. But on a recent CNBC appearance, Strategy's Michael Saylor downplayed quantum's threat to BTC, arguing that the Bitcoin protocol would implement a software upgrade – just like any other tech company – when the threat becomes imminent. ""It's mainly marketing from people that want to sell you the next quantum yo-yo token,"" Saylor said on CNBC. ""Google and Microsoft aren't going to sell you a computer that cracks modern cryptography because it would destroy Google and Microsoft – and the U.S. Government and the banking system."" Already, there are a number of proposals about how to secure Proof of Work against the quantum threat, including from BTQ , a startup building quantum-proof crypto hardware. One Bitcoin developer has put forward a draft Bitcoin Improvement Protocol that proposes a hard fork which would move everyone's wallets to quantum-secure addresses. ""Bitcoin is a protocol; the software gets upgraded every year,"" Saylor concluded, arguing that the bigger security threat for bitcoin is phishing. Saylor's view isn't a universal one, however. A recent report from Presto Research argued that the crypto industry is ""unprepared"" for the coming quantum threat. With BTC above $100K and the market getting ready to challenge another all-time high, traders just don't seem to be concerned. As CRCL has a Blockbuster IPO, the True Market Size of Stablecoins Remains a Mystery. Circle recently had a blockbuster initial public offering, and is set to open the U.S. trading week Monday at over $107 – an impressive rally over its opening price of $69. The number of stablecoins in circulation – the market cap of the asset category – is a well-known fact. Issuance can be seen on-chain after all, and that number comes in at $254 billion, according to CoinGecko data . But figuring out the volume of stablecoins used in payments is a little trickier. In a recent thread on X , Nic Carter, partner at Castle Island Ventures and the cofounder of blockchain data aggregator Coinmetrics, parsed through the available data and found that there's a huge discrepancy in the numbers. Estimating the genuine share of stablecoin transactions driven by payments rather than trading is complicated due to challenges like MEV bot interference, duplicative on-chain transactions, and spam activity designed purely to inflate metrics. Recent analyses illustrate this uncertainty starkly. A top-down heuristic from Visa and Allium estimates stablecoin transaction volumes at roughly $9 trillion annually as of May 2025. However, this figure broadly encompasses trading, DeFi activity, and settlements—not purely payments. In contrast, more detailed bottom-up analyses offer narrower but clearer insights. Fireblocks, a major custody provider, reported annual verified stablecoin payments of around $232 billion, compared with a significantly larger $2.12 trillion in trading volumes among its clients, suggesting that genuine payment transactions represent about 10% of their total stablecoin activity. Similarly, a targeted joint study by Artemis and Dragonfly sampled 20 stablecoin-focused payment providers directly. It calculated a conservative annualized payment volume of approximately $72.3 billion, acknowledging this as a probable undercount given limited sampling. In comparison to that $72.3 billion figure at the high end, Carter writes, is $232 billion, underscoring the substantial uncertainty around how extensively stablecoins are genuinely used as a payment mechanism. As for Circle, the stablecoin issuer doesn't provide a figure in its IPO filing on how much USDC is used for payments, only pointing to general transaction volume. News Roundup Coinbase, BiT Global Settle Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) Delisting Lawsuit BiT Global and Coinbase have settled their legal dispute over Coinbase's delisting of wrapped bitcoin (wBTC), CoinDesk previously reported . According to a joint court filing, BiT Global agreed to dismiss its lawsuit with prejudice—meaning the case cannot be refiled—and each company will cover its own legal costs. BiT Global initially sued Coinbase last year, claiming the delisting unfairly damaged wBTC's liquidity and reputation, while favoring Coinbase’s competing token, cbBTC. Coinbase cited concerns over crypto billionaire Justin Sun’s involvement with wBTC, labeling it an ""unacceptable risk,"" though specific settlement terms beyond the dismissal were not disclosed. Winklevoss Twins' Crypto Exchange Gemini Files Confidentially With SEC for IPO Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange and custody platform founded by billionaires Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has confidentially filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to go public, CoinDesk previously reported . The IPO details, including the size and valuation, remain undisclosed, but Gemini has already engaged Goldman Sachs and Citigroup as financial advisors, positioning itself prominently among crypto-native firms entering traditional markets. This filing follows the successful IPO of stablecoin issuer Circle, whose shares surged dramatically upon debuting on the New York Stock Exchange. Gemini's planned IPO represents a significant step for crypto companies seeking broader acceptance in mainstream finance, although the timing of the offering will depend on the SEC's review and market conditions. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin trades flat at $105,600.30 after recovering from an intraday dip, as miners' recent surge in exchange transfers signals potential volatility ahead. ETH: Ethereum held strong above critical $2,500 support amid volatility, closing bullishly near $2,534, as BlackRock's ETH ETF nears $5 billion on sustained institutional inflows. Gold: Gold trades slightly lower at $3,314.92 but heads for weekly gains, supported by weak U.S. jobs data despite easing U.S.-China tensions.

Meanwhile, Tron is steadily gaining traction with over 10 billion total transactions and daily activity crossing 8.4 million. The token has even surpassed Cardano in market cap, signaling a clear shift in market dynamics. While ETH and TRX continue to strengthen their footing, Unstaked is quietly rising as a contender among the top bullish crypto picks for 2025. With significant presale progress and upcoming AI tools set to launch after exchange listing, Unstaked is positioning itself for a breakout. Unstaked: Eyes on $5 with AI-Driven Utility What makes Unstaked stand out is its real use case, AI technology aligned with blockchain for practical automation. It’s not just talk. The team is building AI agents to support social activities on Telegram, X, and Discord for creators, DAOs, and Web3 users. These AI systems are set to go live only after exchange listings begin. As Unstaked sits in Stage 19, its price is $0.011065, and over 1.1 billion coins have been sold with total presale funds reaching $9.2 million. This growth points to strong user confidence. Rather than selling a vague AI idea, Unstaked is building a working product meant to ease the workload across online communities. With a listing price of $0.1819, early buyers are aiming for a possible 27x gain. But the broader target is $5, something many see as feasible due to its actual use case and growing demand. Among today’s top bullish crypto picks, Unstaked is grabbing attention with strong presale traction and a realistic roadmap. TRX 2025 Outlook: Strong Activity but Questions Remain Tron (TRX) has shown positive signals in 2025, with its price staying above $0.27. It recently surpassed Cardano in market cap, entering the top 9 globally. This jump comes from consistent user activity and stablecoin inflows. The platform has now logged over 10 billion transactions, with more than 8.4 million happening daily. Market sentiment is currently set to “Greed,” while volatility has slowed. Analysts predict TRX could soon hit $0.30, with a possible climb to $0.53 by year-end. With $379 million in daily trading and growing user engagement, TRX is building confidence. Even though it doesn’t always make headlines, its performance stats speak loudly. Ethereum Price Movement: ETF Support and Pectra Rollout Ethereum (ETH) is gaining strength again, hovering near $2,509. Recent ETF inflows and the Pectra upgrade have played key roles. May alone brought $564 million from spot ETFs, indicating strong institutional support. The May 7 Pectra update raised validator limits to 2,048 ETH, boosting efficiency and transaction speed. Network use remains above 50%, and Layer-2 protocols continue to drive activity. ETH holds a $302 billion market cap with $13.8 billion in daily volume. Experts now expect a short-term move to $2,541. With the Fear & Greed Index still showing “Greed,” ETH may keep climbing through Q3 as long as ETF momentum continues. Final Thoughts! Ethereum (ETH) and Tron (TRX) are both delivering noticeable performance in 2025. ETH is gaining on the back of its Pectra upgrade and ETF growth, while TRX maintains strength above $0.27 due to network activity and reduced volatility. Still, Unstaked could be the standout. With its price at $0.011065, 1.1 billion coins sold, and crypto presale funding now at $9.2 million, the numbers are speaking clearly. Its AI tools, set to activate post-listing, aim to serve real user needs daily. For those watching top bullish crypto options, Unstaked offers both momentum and a clear path forward. That $5 target may not be so far off.

The shift from speculation to real-world impact has created a clearer path for those searching for the most popular crypto options that could deliver in 2025 and beyond. While meme tokens and hype cycles may dominate headlines, names like BlockDAG, VeChain, Chainlink, and Ondo are drawing sustained interest due to their consistent development and growing utility. From enterprise adoption and data infrastructure to tokenized finance and mobile-powered mining, these four platforms represent different strategies with shared potential. BlockDAG (BDAG): From Mobile Miners to Market Momentum BlockDAG is emerging as a serious contender among the most popular crypto picks this year. With its June 13 Go Live reveal fast approaching, anticipation is building around upcoming updates expected to outline its exchange rollout, coin utility roadmap, and broader ecosystem plans. What makes BlockDAG particularly compelling is how aligned its development, user adoption, and financial traction have become. The X1 Miner app , which allows users to earn BDAG coins on mobile devices without traditional mining hardware, has already attracted more than 1.5 million users. This level of engagement demonstrates that BlockDAG’s concept of accessible mining is working and scaling. Financially, the numbers are just as impressive. Over $289 million has been raised through the presale, with more than 22 billion BDAG sold. Now in batch 28, the current presale price sits at $0.0018 until June 13, giving buyers a 2,520% return compared to batch 1. With proven demand, working tools, and a well-timed reveal, BlockDAG is transitioning from potential to performance, earning its place among the most popular crypto stories of 2025. VeChain (VET): Real Utility Through Enterprise Supply Chain Innovation VeChain continues to make its mark by focusing on one of the most practical use cases for blockchain: improving supply chain transparency. By helping companies verify products, track logistics, and ensure compliance, VeChain has become a go-to solution in industries ranging from pharmaceuticals to fashion. Its dual-token model, VET for value transfer and VTHO for transaction costs, adds efficiency to its blockchain while making it easier for enterprises to integrate without volatility concerns. Over the past year, VeChain has added new partnerships with global logistics providers and major retailers, reflecting ongoing adoption. For those evaluating the most popular crypto choices from a real-world integration standpoint, VeChain stands out. Its focus on traceability and authenticated data offers a compelling alternative to more speculative projects, especially as more industries digitize their operations and require tamper-proof systems. Chainlink (LINK): A Backbone for DeFi and Web3 Connectivity Chainlink is one of the foundational projects in the DeFi and Web3 space, known for its decentralized oracle network. By supplying smart contracts with off-chain data, including price feeds, market indexes, and weather data, Chainlink plays a critical role in ensuring these systems function accurately. More recently, Chainlink has expanded its scope with the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which enables smart contracts across different blockchains to communicate securely. This development has major implications for multichain applications and could become a central feature of future blockchain architecture. With new collaborations forming between Chainlink and major financial institutions, its position as a bridge between traditional data and blockchain applications continues to grow. As infrastructure plays become more important, Chainlink remains one of the most popular crypto platforms for developers and institutions alike. Ondo (ONDO): Bringing Real-World Financial Assets to the Blockchain Ondo is steadily gaining traction by addressing a growing demand in crypto; access to stable, yield-generating assets. Unlike many DeFi projects that rely on native tokens with variable rewards, Ondo provides blockchain-based exposure to tokenized real-world instruments like U.S. Treasuries and high-yield savings equivalents. This approach is attractive to users who want to benefit from blockchain efficiency without leaving behind the reliability of traditional finance. Ondo’s model focuses on compliance and structured access, making it particularly appealing for more risk-averse investors or those looking to diversify within the ecosystem. As tokenization becomes a leading theme in finance, Ondo is positioning itself as a key player. For anyone tracking the most popular crypto trends focused on bridging institutional and on-chain finance, this project is worth serious attention. Final Thoughts The distinction between hype-driven projects and meaningful crypto platforms is becoming more apparent. BlockDAG is pushing ahead with a working mobile miner and strong $289M crypto presale, VeChain is advancing blockchain’s enterprise use, Chainlink remains essential to Web3 infrastructure, and Ondo is redefining asset access on-chain. Together, these projects represent different angles of crypto’s future: accessibility, utility, connectivity, and integration. As interest shifts toward platforms with clear progress and purpose, these four are emerging among the most popular crypto options to watch in 2025, not just for what they might become, but for what they’re already building today.

According to people who know the matter, this top artificial intelligence startup provides data labeling services. Assuming this prospective dea l closes, it would also be Meta’s largest AI acquisition to date — and one of the largest funding rounds in recent history for a private company. The report said the deal terms were not yet finalized and could still change. Alexandr Wang urges congress to act fast on AI data strategy Just three months after DeepSeek sent waves through the global tech community with an AI model on par with America’s best, 28-year-old AI entrepreneur Alexandr Wang came before Congress with a sobering message: the US needs to move quickly to protect its edge. According to Wang, America needs to establish a “national AI data reserve,” supply enough power for data centers, and avoid an onerous patchwork of state-level rules. He said this at the April hearing, and lawmakers welcomed his feedback. “It’s good to see you again here in Washington,” Republican Representative Neal Dunn of Florida said. “You’re becoming a regular up here.” Wang is the CEO of Scale AI, a company quietly but powerfully shaping the future of artificial intelligence. While not as widely known as OpenAI’s Sam Altman , Wang has become a key figure in tech and policy circles. Scale AI provides foundational data-labeling services for companies like Meta and OpenAI, powering the training of AI models and helping businesses build custom AI applications. Initially known for labeling images for self-driving car models, Scale has since shifted toward curating the massive volumes of text data needed for large language models like ChatGPT. Today, Scale recruits highly educated professionals—PhDs, nurses, and legal experts—to develop sophisticated AI systems. “The three pillars of AI are chips, talent, and data,” said one person familiar with the company’s operations. “Scale dominates the data pillar.” Now, Scale’s influence is poised to grow dramatically with Meta’s multibillion-dollar investment in the company. Scale was last valued at $14 billion in 2024, with Meta already on its cap table. Scale AI adapts to AI’s next frontier with expert workforce Scale’s rise mirrors that of OpenAI in many ways. Both companies were founded roughly a decade ago, betting that the world was on the verge of an AI revolution. Wang and Altman, friends who once shared a home, have become influential figures in the AI conversation on Capitol Hill. Like OpenAI, Scale has drawn interest from major tech firms eager to invest in its future. However, the company’s journey hasn’t been without controversy. Scale has faced criticism for its reliance on low-paid contractors in countries like Kenya and the Philippines, who comb through massive amounts of online content—sometimes disturbing—to help train AI systems. Some workers have reported psychological distress from the nature of the material. In a 2019 interview with Bloomberg, Wang said the company’s contract workers earn “good” pay — “in the 60th to 70th percentile of wages in their geography.” According to company spokesperson Joe Osborne, a recent US Department of Labor investigation into Scale’s labor practices was dropped. As the industry shifts toward synthetic data for training AI, Scale is adapting. While synthetic data may reduce the need for some traditional labeling work, leading AI labs are still struggling to find enough high-quality data for training models capable of solving complex, human-level problems. In response, Scale is increasingly turning to well-compensated experts with advanced degrees to guide its models through a process called reinforcement learning—rewarding correct answers and penalizing incorrect ones. These experts craft challenging, domain-specific problems for AI models to solve, helping refine their capabilities in sensitive fields such as law and medicine. As of early 2025, 12% of these contributors had PhDs—many in fields like molecular biology—while more than 40% held master’s degrees, JDs, or MBAs. Much of Scale’s recent focus has been on helping companies develop AI tools for high-stakes applications like tax law, which varies across jurisdictions and requires nuanced understanding. This pivot is already paying off. Bloomberg reported that scale generated approximately $870 million in revenue in 2024 and is on track to more than double that to $2 billion in 2025. Interest in its expert workforce has surged since DeepSeek’s emergence as companies race to build models capable of human-like reasoning. Scale AI has also cemented its relationship with the US government, securing defense contracts and finding allies among policymakers wary of China’s AI ambitions. Wang, who is hawkish on China, has made deep connections on Capitol Hill. Meanwhile, former Scale executive Michael Kratsios advises President Donald Trump on AI policy. A closer match with Scale could help Meta fend off rivals like Google and OpenAI and deepen its connections to US defense and regulatory circles. For Scale, the transaction would draw a deep-pocketed ally — and a potential full-circle moment for Wang. In the early days of Scale, a venture capitalist once asked Wang when he knew he wanted to start a company. His answer? “I rattled off some silly answer about being inspired by The Social Network ,” he said, referencing the movie about Facebook’s founding. With Meta knocking on his door, that inspiration may finally come full circle.

The project aims at enhancing AI skills among British workers and students. This came after the labor leader revealed plans to host an in-conversation event in London with tech billionaire Huang to inaugurate a deal that sees Nvidia assist in the UK to train more people in AI and push forward research at universities and the company’s AI lab in Bristol, west England. Starmer places technology and artificial intelligence at the center of his government’s plan to drive economic growth. Downing Street reveals eagerness to highlight its growth strategies instead of budget cuts At the beginning of a critical week in which the labor government will set out its usage plans to spend hundreds of billions over the time of the parliament, Starmer wants to highlight an optimistic outlook for technology and development. On the other hand, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves is coming under pressure from opposition parties and some of her own colleagues over anticipated cuts elsewhere. In her spending review, Reeves will focus first on the cherished but struggling National Health Service and the UK’s ability to project military power in the face of Russian aggression and the potential for diminished support from US President Donald Trump’s White House. She will also confirm big capital investment — which is not included within her fiscal rules — but day-to-day spending will be tight, with some departments facing real-terms cuts. Downing Street, eager to highlight its growth strategies instead of budget cuts, announced £86 billion worth $116 billion in funding for British science over the weekend. This funding will support pharmaceuticals, green energy, and military technology. The government noted that major tech companies such as IBM, QinetiQ, Microsoft, BT, and defense manufacturer BAE Systems are backing this initiative. Starmer hosted CEOs and investors—including Eric Schmidt and Demis Hassabis—this past weekend at Chequers, his countryside retreat, as part of its efforts to advance technology in the UK. UK PMs prioritize AI skills to achieve economic growth The UK is a global AI hub, leading Europe in AI startups funded for the first time and total private investment in AI through 2024. Additionally, the industry has been expanding rapidly and has been supported by more than $28 billion in private investment since 2013. Notably, investing in AI brings advantages to everyone in the UK. Keir Starmer’s vision for Britain to become an AI maker, not an AI taker, is set to be realized at London Tech Week. London Tech Week is scheduled to run from June 9th and end on June 13th. To mark the occasion, NVIDIA and some of Britain’s most innovative companies are coming together to host the first UK Sovereign AI Industry Forum. This brings together some of the UK’s most significant and forward-thinking businesses – including inaugural members Babcock, BAE Systems, BT, National Grid, and Standard Chartered – and enhances the security of the nation’s economy by rolling out AI infrastructure on sovereign soil and supercharging the growth of the UK’s AI startup ecosystem. Through its partnership with NVIDIA, the UK is developing sovereign computing infrastructure, investing in world-class leading research and skills, and promoting leadership in AI across all sectors. Peter Kyle, a Member of Parliament of the United Kingdom who has served as Secretary of State for Science, Innovation, and Technology since July 2024, commented on the topic of discussion. According to Kyle, they have ambitious goals for creating the next generation of AI advancements in the UK. Based on his argument, this will help them achieve the economic growth they need for their “Plan for Change” and keep their status as global leaders. Kyle further stated that ensuring they have the right infrastructure to support AI is a key part of this. He was pleased that NVIDIA is establishing the UK Sovereign AI Industry Forum. He added that this forum will unite top British companies to develop and implement these technologies across the UK, helping them to promote growth and create new opportunities.

45700501,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=742363,1749430800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45700501.jpeg,Mutuum Finance (MUTM): The DeFi Platform That Has Excited DOGE Investors,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/mutuum-finance-mutm-the-defi-platform-that-has-excited-doge-investors/,"Over the past two years, Dogecoin (DOGE) has captivated investors, which has led to hype-fueled growth. However, a new project in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space is turning the tide due to its promise of long-term growth. So far, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised over $10.1 million from eager crypto investors and shows no signs of slowing down. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale will not come as a surprise to keen observers of the crypto market. For a while now, investors have been making the switch from hype-driven projects to ones driven by long-term ecosystem growth. Mutuum Finance, which aims to bring innovative solutions to the Defi space, has demonstrated a strong value proposition that is pulling in more investors daily. Its design envisions an ecosystem where the native MUTM token is at the heart of a thriving ecosystem. The team has laid out a clear plan that will support the long-term growth of the MUTM token price while deepening liquidity in the DeFi protocol. DOGE Holders Are Exploring New Avenues For Growth DOGE, which is a well-known meme coin, lured in millions of investors globally with flashy branding and hype. However, many holders who bought into the hype have realized its long-term growth is not feasible. There are no clear plans to establish a thriving ecosystem like that on Mutuum Finance. As such, investors have been forced to sit back and watch as their holdings dwindle in value. This can be clearly seen in the price chart for DOGE, which shows the meme coin is down nearly 20% in the past week alone. Millions of disillusioned DOGE investors have been seriously looking for new avenues for growth, and quite a number have found their way to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). As the message continues to spread and the presale continues to hit new milestones, it is expected to trigger a wave of new buyers. Progress Of The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has been a resounding success so far, raising over $10.1 million from over 11,700 investors. Tokens in Phase 5 of the presale are going for $0.03, which is a massive 200% increase from the Phase 1 price of $0.01. However, the price increase has not stopped new buyers from joining the presale, as many still view it as a massive bargain, based on some of the analysts’ forecasts of 1300% gains. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price is set to rise another 16.67% to $0.035. That will see the expected ROI in the presale dip from the current 100% to 71.43%, based on the expected listing price of $0.06. Besides the massive utility that is expected for this project, the ongoing $100,000 giveaway has been another major catalyst. The project team plans to give ten lucky winners $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. To qualify for this giveaway, all that presale participants need to do is buy at least $50 worth of MUTM tokens. The giveaway, coupled with the expected 100% ROI, means that phase 5 buyers who qualify for the giveaway essentially have an opportunity to win $10k free. Mutuum Finance Protocol The Mutuum Finance protocol is a marvel of DeFi engineering that is expected to usher in a new era for the decentralized finance sector. On the protocol, users can participate as borrowers or lenders. Lenders can deposit funds into the protocol and earn interest. The interest rate they earn is based on the lending pool’s utilization rate. For borrowers, it presents an opportunity to deposit collateral and receive high-quality assets in return. One reason for borrowing is that a user can unlock the value of their assets without having to spend them. That way, when the value goes up, they can repay their loans and get back their assets. The mtToken Feature A unique feature of the protocol is the mtTokens. When a lender deposits funds in a pool, they receive mtTokens, which represent the value of their assets, plus any interest accrued. For instance, if a lender deposits $2,100 worth of BNB, they will receive mtBNB tokens on a 1:1 ratio to their deposit. One benefit of the mtTokens system is that lenders do not have to actively claim their gains. Instead, the protocol automatically adjusts the value of their mtTokens to reflect the interest accrued. This system also gives lenders instant access to the value of their assets. Since mtTokens are based on the ERC20 token standard, they can be traded freely on secondary exchanges. For instance, lenders can deposit their assets on Uniswap to unlock further market opportunities in real time. Mutuum Finance plans to establish mtToken pairs on decentralized exchanges to make this a reality. Sustainable MUTM Token Price Growth Mutuum Finance also plans to boost the price of MUTM tokens after launch through a program of buying and distributing tokens to stakers in the safety module. The program is designed to establish the long-term growth of the tokens, thereby providing a huge boost to the visibility of the protocol. That will cause more users to join, which will increase protocol profits, leading to a self-sustaining cycle of upward growth. From the above, Mutuum Finance is designed to ensure sustainable returns for its users and MUTM token holders. At the current low price of $0.03, you have an opportunity to join an ecosystem that can support long-term growth. This is an opportunity that you may regret missing in 2025.

On social media platform X , Deaton recently sought to explain why he thinks today’s lofty prices carry more opportunity than risks. His approach flies in the face of the notion that one should “buy low.” He makes the case, by contrast, that macro conditions and long-term potential count for more than short-term price tags. Deaton disclosed that 80% of his net worth is in BTC, and his average purchase cost is less than $25,000. Nonetheless, he does not think the current six-figure range is too late. Instead, he says they’re “more asymmetrical,” meaning there’s more upside based on what he deems are more potential gains versus potential losses—despite the more expensive price. He said this in response to Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey’s appeal for people to find some money and purchase BTC today. Deaton also echoed Bailey’s call but cautioned that citizens living paycheck-to-paycheck should not risk their homes or take out loans to spend money to invest in crypto. Regardless, he maintains that Bitcoin is one of the best current stores for value. Deaton’s criticisms are rooted in larger concerns about the global economy. He cited growing national debt levels in the US, the re-imposition of Trump-era tariffs, and endless money printing from central banks as major red signs. In his view, these are gradually undermining confidence in fiat currencies. For Deaton, BTC is the answer. It’s decentralized, with only 21 million coins ever to be produced, and it can’t be manipulated by governments or printed into infinity. “Bitcoin is a hedge against the collapse of fiat,” Deaton said in a podcast interview last month. Institutions and countries are jumping in Another element of Deaton’s argument is the wave of institutional and even state adoption of Bitcoin. Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) is leading the charge. The company has been in the news for its aggressive purchase of BTC. The firm now owns more than 200,000 BTC, the equivalent of tens of billions of dollars, and is adding to its holdings each week. In the last seven days alone,16 companies have been added to an expanding list of businesses incorporating Bitcoin into their corporate treasury. But businesses are not the only ones being buoyed. Governments are also starting to take Bitcoin more seriously. Rep.Tim Burchett introduced a bill in Congress to codify Trump’s executive order into a law that created a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Countries such as Pakistan, Ukraine, and Ireland are also eyeing similar proposals and exploring the possibility of utilizing BTC n their reserves or foreign exchange plans. Critics groan as studies take off But not everyone is as sanguine as Deaton, even as the movement gathers steam. Dr. Peter Schiff, economist, gold supporter, and outspoken critic of Bitcoin, argued on Twitter that Bitcoin’s moonshot is nothing more than hype. He thinks it still has no inherent value and is far too erratic to be a true haven. But Deaton isn’t fazed.

The volatility has pulled focus away from traditional assets and cast fresh doubt on Bitcoin’s (BTC) near-term stability, sparking fears of a wider market crash. According to Coinglass , over $967 million in crypto market liquidations have occurred, confirming that bullish traders were caught off guard. The sheer scale of the chaos underscores the crypto market’s volatile nature and its reaction to macro headlines, particularly those stirred by Donald Trump or Elon Musk. Trump vs Musk: The Feud Behind the Bitcoin (BTC) Plunge Donald Trump and Elon Musk have turned the crypto market into their battlefield, igniting a wave of panic selling across Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins. Their explosive exchange sent Bitcoin (BTC) plummeting, shedding nearly 3% and pushing it to retest the crucial $100,000 threshold once more. This political clash has pulled the entire crypto market into chaos. Data shows long liquidations for Bitcoin (BTC) totaled over $345 million, fueling analyst speculation regarding the potential for a bigger crash. With Donald Trump and Elon Musk commanding so much public attention, the fallout continues to weigh on sentiment and market direction. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Stands Tall as a Utility-Driven Survivor As the crypto market grapples with the Donald Trump–Elon Musk drama, FloppyPepe (FPPE) stands out as a new breed of altcoin.

These utilities help FloppyPepe (FPPE) remain relevant and active while other projects falter. In a stormy crypto market, these real-world applications provide much-needed substance. Culturally, FloppyPepe (FPPE) draws from Matt Furie’s legacy with hand-drawn art and a hippo conservation pledge. The Floppynomics model includes a 1% supply burn, 1% redistribution, and 1% wildlife donation. This balance of culture, tech, and cause-driven action gives it lasting appeal even as Bitcoin (BTC) wavers. The FloppyPepe (FPPE) Presale Surge Is Just Getting Started While the crypto market is rocked by Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s feud, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is making waves in its Stage 2 presale. Priced at just $0.00000035 , the token has already raised over $363,000 following a record-setting Stage 1 that pulled in $2 million. FloppyPepe (FPPE) further gains backing from top influencers like Nass Crypto, who labeled it an AI gem to his 1 million+ subscribers. This endorsement injected even more momentum into the presale, attracting investors frustrated by Bitcoin (BTC) instability.

Strategic Plays in Volatile Times The crypto market is once again proving just how vulnerable it is to political theatrics, especially when names like Donald Trump and Elon Musk are involved. Bitcoin (BTC) has faced significant damage, and the ripple effects are being felt across nearly every digital asset. This turmoil is exposing which projects are built to last and which are not.

Saylor posted “Send more Orange” on X on June 8 — a phrase often followed by the company’s Bitcoin acquisition announcements. If the pattern holds, this could mark Strategy’s ninth consecutive week of BTC purchases. The post follows closely after Strategy added 705 BTC between May 26 and June 1, spending around $75 million at an average of $106,495 per coin. That brings the firm’s total holdings to 580,955 BTC, valued at about $61.4 billion. According to SaylorTracker, the company is currently up nearly 50% on its investment, translating to an unrealized profit of roughly $20.6 billion. $1 Billion Stock Offering Fuels Bitcoin Strategy Saylor’s cryptic post coincides with Strategy’s announcement of a massive $1 billion stock offering, a sharp increase from the previously planned $250 million raise. The firm aims to use the capital to fund further Bitcoin acquisitions and for general corporate expenses. The offering involves 11.76 million shares of a new 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock, priced at $85 per share. After deducting underwriting and other fees, Strategy expects net proceeds of approximately $979 million. Unlike its earlier funding rounds, the new stock provides non-cumulative 10% dividends — a move designed to appeal to yield-seeking institutional investors. This funding structure enables the company to continue its Bitcoin strategy while offering more predictable returns to shareholders. Largest Institutional Bitcoin Holder Data from Bitcoin Treasuries shows that Strategy now holds more Bitcoin than any other publicly known entity — including governments like the United States and China. Its holdings are nearly twelve times larger than the next biggest corporate holder, Bitcoin miner Mara Holdings. As a result, many investors increasingly view Strategy not just as a business, but as a vehicle for Bitcoin exposure. With Saylor continuing to tease new purchases, the company shows no signs of slowing down.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-06-09 01:52:14

The country received foreign investment for 73 finance projects last year, which caused a 32% decline compared to the previous year. In Germany, which was in second place, deals dropped by 16% to 32. Across Europe, deal volumes decreased by 11%, according to EY’s findings. Martina Keane reveals that the UK’s financial services features attract global investors Reports from sources revealed that investors worldwide favored London as the top European city for foreign investment in financial services in the next 12 months. This is ahead of Frankfurt and Paris, even though Germany was the top choice for the future on a national level. Following Donald Trump’s tariff announcements clouding the future, only 32% were willing to invest in the US, according to a poll. This is compared with 39% for the EU and 44% for the UK. Martina Keane, EY’s EMEIA Financial Services Chief Operating Officer and the firm’s EMEIA Deputy Regional Managing Partner, commented on the situation. Keane stated that the UK’s financial services sector is strong and deep. According to her, this feature keeps attracting global investors, especially during tough market conditions. She also mentioned that the competition for available funding is still intense. EY’s analysis highlights Europe’s drastic decline in FDI project Europe experienced a 5% drop in foreign direct investment (FDI) projects year-on-year. In 2024 the continent attracted 5,383 projects, marking the lowest number in nine years. These project numbers were 16% lower than the pre-COVID-19 pandemic and 19% lower than the peak year in 2017, which was 6,653. Additionally, based on data from EY’s analysis, Europe’s overall FDI project total has dropped for the second consecutive year. This also meant that the continent has had falling FDI numbers for four out of the past seven years. In leading economies, more than 50% of Europe’s annual FDI project total has historically been allocated to France, the UK, and Germany. However, project numbers decreased significantly in these countries last year due to low economic growth, high energy costs, and competition from other markets, such as Asia and the US. France struggled with political uncertainty in 2024, rising labor costs, and postponed tax hikes for large businesses, and Germany’s energy prices rose as its manufacturing shrank. Contrastingly, FDI project totals rose elsewhere in Central, Eastern, and Southern Europe, with Spain experiencing a 15% rise, Poland a 13% rise, and Italy a 5% rise each, though with much smaller numbers compared to the top three ranked countries. The government focuses on demonstrating that the UK is open for business Anna Anthony, EY UK & Ireland regional managing partner, highlighted the positivity that the UK still ranks near the top in Europe for investment. However, Anthony stated that the UK was not immune to the decline in FDI volume felt by other large European nations last year. According to the regional managing partner, the UK still has a strong investment story to share. She claimed it has done better than Europe in attracting investments in industries like technology and life sciences, creating the most jobs related to FDI, and drawing funds from a wide range of global sources. The government is actively working to demonstrate that the UK is open for business by strengthening trade relationships with India and the US. They also focus on sectors they believe will see the most growth and investment under their Industrial Strategy. Based on Anthony’s argument, the UK can showcase a stable regulatory and business environment, which could help attract important FDI projects during this global economic uncertainty, leading to increased value, job creation, and prosperity. The global economy has suffered because international trade disruptions have made things difficult. How much this has impacted investor appetite this year is yet to be seen.

These assets often evolve beyond mere financial tokens to become foundational platforms for decentralized services, development tools, and real-world adoption. Identifying such assets early can offer participants strategic positioning before broader market recognition occurs.One of the most talked-about names in 2025 is Qubetics (TICS) —a cross-border transaction-focused platform making significant strides with its presale achievements and infrastructure readiness. Alongside it, industry giants like Ethereum and fast-rising modular Layer-1 contender Sonic have both earned their status as established or emerging blockchain powerhouses. Each serves a distinct role in the ecosystem—and all three are recognized among today’s crypto top gainers for different but equally compelling reasons. Qubetics (TICS): Cross-Border Efficiency with Economic Upside Qubetics is redefining global finance by delivering seamless, low-cost cross-border transactions through a decentralized infrastructure. Its protocol enables businesses, freelancers, and financial platforms to send and receive digital assets across multiple chains without centralized intermediaries or excessive fees. For instance, a Dubai-based ecommerce brand can pay a logistics partner in Asia using stablecoins via Qubetics, automatically routing through the lowest-fee blockchain. Meanwhile, a European freelancer receiving USDT can convert and withdraw in local currency using on-chain liquidity options. This streamlines international settlement, reduces currency conversion delays, and eliminates dependency on traditional banking rails. The Qubetics platform leverages smart contract automation, decentralized liquidity pools, and on-chain identity verification to make cross-border payments more secure and scalable. This feature suite positions Qubetics not only as a blockchain utility project but as a fintech alternative capable of displacing legacy remittance models. These real-life scenarios illustrate how Qubetics bridges the gap between digital and global commerce. Qubetics’ infrastructure is interoperable with top networks including Ethereum, Arbitrum, and BNB Chain, ensuring flexibility for multi-chain execution. These innovations contribute to its rapidly growing reputation as one of the crypto top gainers in utility and market traction. Qubetics Presale Performance and Strategic Tokenomics Qubetics has officially entered Stage 37, the final phase of its public presale. The token is currently priced at $0.3370, with a confirmed listing price of $0.40—providing a potential 20% value uplift at launch. More than 515 million $TICS tokens have been sold, with over $17.7 million raised and 27,500+ holders participating to date. These indicators reflect strong market confidence and community adoption. The protocol recently implemented a tokenomics overhaul, reducing the total supply from 4 billion to 1.36 billion, introducing immediate scarcity. Meanwhile, the public sale allocation was increased to 38.55%, promoting broader access to governance and utility participation. This balance between scarcity and decentralization enhances both token longevity and functional adoption. From a short-term gains perspective, the financial narrative is compelling. A $1,000 allocation at $0.3370 secures 2,967 $TICS tokens, which would be valued at $1,186.95 at launch. If the token reaches $5, that becomes $14,836.90—and a surge to $10 would bring the total value to $29,673.80. These projections are based on fixed, confirmed token structures—placing Qubetics firmly among the best crypto presale of the year. With limited token availability and final presale access closing soon, early participants are locking in what analysts identify as one of the year’s most lucrative and utility-rich blockchain opportunities—making Qubetics a core name among 2025’s crypto top gainers.

Now, a new altcoin is being closely watched for its potential to match—or even exceed—that performance. Lightchain AI , currently in presale at $0.007, has already raised $18.3 million, reflecting massive early interest. Unlike DOGE, which is largely driven by community hype, Lightchain AI is built on real utility, combining artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to power scalable, decentralized applications. As momentum grows, many believe Lightchain AI could deliver the kind of breakout gains once only seen in DOGE’s biggest year. DOGE’s 2021 Pump Sets Benchmark ​In 2021, Dogecoin (DOGE) the word Dogecoin is now used to refer to the cryptocurrency experienced a meteoric rise, famously changing from a meme-based cryptocurrency to an important market player. It started off the year at about $0.004, and by May, it had reached a historic high of $0.75, which was over 18,000% higher. The record-breaking surge was spurred by the hype released by the media and the social media campaign, most notably that of Elon Musk, the famous billionaire, that attracted lots of investors. The 2021 rally not just increased Dogecoin’s market cap but also set a new record for potential in the cryptocurrency market. Commentators point out that this kind of growth could bring Dogecoin up to a new price level, nonetheless, that is just a hypothesis since it is impossible to predict the future of a cryptocurrency with certainty. (Commas or semicolons are needed) Such predictions can be really inaccurate as they are based on the cryptocurrency domain’s unstable behavior. Lightchain AI Tipped to Outperform That Surge Lightchain AI is tipped to outperform that surge as investors shift focus toward utility-driven, AI-integrated blockchain platforms. Unlike many hype-fueled projects, Lightchain AI brings real value through its low-latency architecture and smart tokenomics. It features a seamless workflow where decentralized nodes process and verify AI tasks in real time, enhancing speed and scalability. With validator and contributor nodes powering security and AI execution, and robust dApp development tools, it supports an ecosystem ready for mass adoption. As other altcoins rise on speculation, Lightchain AI stands out by delivering performance, innovation, and utility—key ingredients for sustainable long-term gains. Analysts believe its technology could drive stronger upside momentum than many current top performers. Lightchain AI- Next Big Crypto Breakout? At just $0.007 in its presale, Lightchain AI has already raised over $18 million, signaling massive early interest and a future packed with potential. Combining the power of AI and blockchain, this project is turning heads—and momentum is only growing. Some analysts predict Lightchain AI could even outshine DOGE’s legendary 2021 surge, soaring to new heights within its first year of trading. If they’re right, this could be a game-changer in the crypto world, solidifying its spot as a top-performing altcoin with real utility. Don’t miss the chance to watch—or be part of—this rise to the top! https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-09 03:00:00

Bitcoin BTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, traded flat-to-negative near $105,650, having carved out a doji candle, a sign of indecision, on Sunday, according to data source TradingView. Data from Blockchain.com showed a marked slowdown in network activity, with the seven-day moving average of daily on-chain transactions falling to 315.48K, the lowest in at least a year. Payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP struggled to gather upside traction despite topping a bearish trendline from the mid-May highs. The cryptocurrency changed hands at $2.24 at press time, down over 1% on the day (UTC). Volatility may increase this week as the XRP Ledger's APEX 2025 conference kicks off in Singapore. Meme cryptocurrency DOGE traded nearly 2% lower, closing in on 18 cents, having failed to establish a foothold above the 100-day simple moving average (SMA) over the weekend. Hang Seng tops 24K Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 1.3%, topping the 24,000 mark for the first time since March 24, according to data source TradingView. The move came in response to the optimism about the U.S.-China trade talks this week. ""Optimism is as high as it's been since Trump's election as top trade deputies will meet in London starting on Monday. There are indications that talks will go all week and Trump himself is optimistic,"" ForexLive's Chief Currency Analyst Adam Button said in a blog post. ""The meeting should go very well,"" President Donald Trump said on Truth Social Friday, announcing the new round of trade talks in London. Other Asian indices, such as South Korea's KOSPI and China's Shanghai Composite, also gained ground despite the deepening consumer and factory gate deflation in China. China's deflation worsens China's consumer prices fell 0.1% year-over-year in May, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics released on Monday. The CPI first turned negative in February. Meanwhile, the producer price index, or factory gate prices, fell 3.3% year-over-year in May, registering a sharper decline than the 3.2% drop analysts had expected. Factory gate prices have been in deflation since October 2022. According to Robin Brooks, senior fellow in the Global Economy and Development program at the Brookings Institution, the U.S. tariffs are generating a deflationary shock for major exporters like China. ""China's producer price inflation for consumer goods is down to its lowest level since the 2008 crisis. U.S. tariffs will now push China into full-on deflation. All necessary conditions for deflation are there: weak consumption and a debt overhang. U.S. tariffs are now the catalyst...,"" Brooks said on X. The worsening deflation could prompt China to stimulate domestic demand with further liquidity easing. China’s central bank in May cut the key interest rates by 10 basis points to a historic low while reducing the reserve requirement ratio, releasing liquidity into the market. Last week, the state-run China Securities Journal reported that the People's Bank of China may lower the reserve requirement ratio further later this year to support growth and restart government bond trading. More Chinese stimulus could bode well for financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. Focus on U.S. CPI The U.S. consumer price index for May due Wednesday will be scrutinized by markets for clues that Trump's tariffs are adding to price pressures in the economy. The headline CPI is seen matching April's pace of 0.2% month-on-month growth, equating to an annualized 2.5% rise versus April's 2.3% increase, according to FXStreet. Meawhile, the core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy component, is forecast to have ticked higher to 2.9% in May from 2.8% in April. Economists at Barclays expect the data to show first signs of tariffs-related price increases across wide range of core goods. A hotter-than-expected print could dent Fed rate cuts, potentially injecting downside volatility in financial markets.",Markets|Bitcoin|XRP|DOGE|Markets|News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-09 03:51:03

BlockDAG is taking a different route. Its mobile-first mining approach is gaining real traction, as the X1 app now has over 1.5 million global users. This level of early adoption sets BlockDAG apart from many others, suggesting it may be one of the few projects prioritizing infrastructure before hype. The X1 app stands out by removing entry barriers. Users mine BDAG coins directly on their smartphones with no battery drain or expensive setups. A referral-based structure and daily engagement model have driven strong viral growth. With millions already participating before full platform launch, BlockDAG (BDAG) is showing that product adoption, not just narrative, still matters in crypto. SHIB Price Declines as Utility Concerns Persist While BlockDAG is scaling up, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is showing signs of fatigue. In the past 24 hours, SHIB has dropped by over 6%, continuing a wider correction trend. Data from Crypto Times attributes the slide to recent profit-taking activity, with larger wallets exiting positions after prior price gains. Despite SHIB’s large following and strong brand, its lack of updated functionality is beginning to show. No new features or integrations have been announced recently, raising questions about the project’s future role. As the market shifts toward real-world applications, SHIB’s meme-centered model may face limitations in maintaining relevance. BNB Shows Strength but Faces Slower Growth Outlook Binance Coin (BNB) has managed to hold its ground. At around $669, it remains steady following recent developments, including a court ruling that dismissed several SEC charges tied to Binance. Additionally, a successful hard fork has improved its network performance, helping reinforce user confidence. Even with these gains, BNB’s long-term potential still depends on the broader strength of the Binance ecosystem. With growing competition from other Layer-1 chains and constant regulatory focus, BNB may offer reliability but could deliver less upside compared to projects with newer, rapidly expanding user bases. For many in the market, BNB appears as a stable choice, though not necessarily the most aggressive path to higher returns. What Separates BlockDAG’s X1 App from the Crowd The appeal of BlockDAG’s X1 app lies in how it blends usability with consistent engagement. It’s only 50MB, needs no high-performance device, and gives users a daily mining task through simple tapping. Referral bonuses and engagement rewards help create ongoing involvement and rapid community expansion. This ease of access brings new users into crypto without requiring deep technical knowledge. BlockDAG’s mobile focus helps extend its reach, especially in regions where mobile-first access is the norm. And instead of speculation, users actively earn and interact, deepening their role in the broader ecosystem before launch. The roadmap includes more than just mining. The team plans to introduce low-code tools, expand community features, and integrate Web3 capabilities. With presale numbers nearing $290 million, market participants are clearly backing the strategy. More than just financial commitment, it’s the scale of user participation that positions BlockDAG for a successful public entry. With 1.5 million people already using the X1 app, BlockDAG is preparing to go live with one of the largest pre-launch user bases ever seen in crypto. This kind of adoption has two key implications. First, when BlockDAG enters the public market, it is likely to generate strong trading activity, driven by users who already hold BDAG and are ready to transact. Second, it builds momentum for further integrations and ecosystem features, all supported by a network effect already in motion. A functional community often outweighs the code behind a platform. BlockDAG has built this community before the exchange listing, which is something most projects struggle to do. The X1 app’s rapid growth is not a coincidence. It reflects a strategy centered on user engagement, long before trading begins. Few presale-stage platforms have this kind of operational foundation, and it’s this structure that gives BlockDAG a stronger long-term outlook compared to other projects still focused on pre-launch promises. With the BDAG presale price locked at $0.0018 and funding already over $289 million, BlockDAG is transitioning from a concept to a practical use case for mobile crypto adoption. Key Insights In a market still filled with short-term swings and speculative models, BlockDAG is working on building real infrastructure. Its X1 app now serves over 1.5 million users, demonstrating practical demand for a product well before its token hits exchanges. As SHIB declines and BNB levels out, BlockDAG is continuing to expand. It’s not chasing quick listings but building an environment where access, function, and growth align. From mobile accessibility and technical scalability to early user participation, BlockDAG is covering all the fundamentals. If future value in crypto depends on actual adoption, BlockDAG is clearly well-positioned. While others talk about readiness, BlockDAG may already be there, bringing over 1.5 million people with it.

Meanwhile, Veteran Crypto expert Michael van de Poppe explained why he thinks the altcoins season is about to start soon. Altcoins Have Been Slow for Years Michael says that altcoins have not been doing well since late 2021. He remembers that the last big altcoin season was in 2017, when almost every altcoin was going up fast. In 2021, older altcoins didn’t do as well as newer tokens. In 2024, most of the hype was about memecoins, not the usual altcoins. He also points out that in the past four years, Bitcoin went as high as $65,000, and during that time, around 95% of altcoin gains were already done. But after that, altcoins kept falling, and many people stopped caring about them. Global Factors Holding Back Altcoins Van de Poppe believes this cycle is different. He says that altcoins are underperforming because we’re still in a “Bitcoin season,” and people are afraid to take risks. When #Altseason ? One of the most asked questions, as people are looking to make a large return, willing to bet everything on it. Altseason hasn't come for a long time, the question is: when will this start to appear? I think we're not too far off, and it's all about… pic.twitter.com/8GtMzDD0Zt — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) June 8, 2025 Meanwhile, Central banks are changing their economic policies, and many fear a recession. And the real progress is happening in DeFi and other parts of the crypto world. Gold is even hitting a new all-time high, which might make people feel safer about investing again. Even the Chinese Renminbi is doing better than the Dollar, which often helps Ethereum do better than Bitcoin. Altcoin Season: When Will It Start? Michael shares that people are eagerly waiting for altcoin season, asking, “When will it start?” He says there are two types of people right now, some think the market is still in a bear phase, while others believe the next big rise is just beginning. He feels that now is a good time to pick up altcoins. Many of them are priced low and have strong teams. Michael says this is the chance to buy them quietly, before the rest of the world catches on.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-09 04:05:00

Trading at $2.25 as of press time, XRP ( XRP ) is up 3.8% over the last day. The price is near the upper end of its weekly range between $2.09 and $2.29. With 24-hour volume reaching $2.65 billion, trading volume is up almost 180% from the day before, reflecting growing trader interest. Rising volume alongside price gains often hints at stronger conviction among market participants. Coinglass data also reveals a spike in derivatives activity. XRP’s futures volume has increased 201.98% to $4.82 billion, while open interest has increased 11.48% to $4.09 billion. This can support short-term price movements in either direction since it indicates that more traders are opening positions and placing bets on ongoing volatility. However, not all signals are positive. According to data from XRP scan, on-chain activity is slipping, raising concerns about the sustainability of this rally. By June 8, there were only about 600,000 payments between accounts, down from almost 900,000 at the beginning of the month. Likewise, the number of transactions has decreased from roughly 1.5 million at the start of June to just over 1.1 million in the last few days. XRP transaction count.

These metrics often show user engagement and utility on the XRP Ledger, and their decline may indicate that network demand is waning despite the price increase. From a technical perspective, XRP has been able to maintain its position above a crucial support level close to $2.08. After recently recovering from this area, the price is now pressing against the middle band of the Bollinger Bands near $2.25. A break above this level could open the way toward the upper band at $2.42. XRP price analysis. Credit: crypto.news Although it is trending upward after recovering from oversold levels, the relative strength index is still neutral near 50. If momentum builds, bulls could target a move back to the $2.60–$2.65 resistance area seen in late May. However, if $2.25 is not broken, a retest of $2.08 may occur, and a breakdown there might reveal the $2.05–$2.00 range. Until on-chain metrics reverse course, price gains may remain fragile even as short-term momentum builds.

The platform is designed to offer users fair and transparent access to high-quality tokens. By removing barriers to entry and offering discounted subscriptions to premium assets, it gives equal opportunity to all users, regardless of account status, trading volume, or social influence. The first subscription event under this new model will feature Bitcoin (BTC), marking a high-trust starting point and kicking off its BTC Trading Month. While many launchpads promise community access, most have evolved into tiered, opaque systems where venture capitalists, influencers, and VIPs secure favorable allocations — leaving regular users with scraps. MEXC’s new launchpad model challenges this status quo by removing lotteries, VIP tiers, and preferential pools. Instead, it introduces a fully transparent, contribution-based allocation mechanism that puts retail users and large investors on equal footing. “The spirit of launchpads has been lost in recent years,” said Tracy Jin , COO of MEXC. “We’re bringing it back — by making early-stage investing truly community-first again.” Participation in the MEXC Launchpad is open to everyone . Users can directly subscribe to project offerings using USDT or other designated tokens. Allocations are distributed on a purely proportional basis, with simple tasks, point farming, or influencer-driven campaigns involved. There are two primary models available: full subscription, where tokens are allocated directly based on the invested amount, and oversubscription, where allocations are shared proportionally among participants when demand exceeds supply. Building on this structure, participants will also be able to subscribe to tokens at discounted rates below the expected market price, increasing their potential upside. MEXC Launchpad is not limited to early-stage projects; it will also provide access to premium, well-established tokens with strong fundamentals and market appeal. The first subscription event under this new model will feature Bitcoin (BTC), marking a high-trust starting point. The subscription period will run from June 6 to June 20 and includes exclusive offers tailored to different user segments. New users will be able to purchase BTC at a discount of up to 90%, with individual allocations ranging from 5 to 55 USDT, and a total pool capped at 4 BTC. Existing users will receive a 20% discount, with allocation limits set between 25 and 250 USD1 , and a total cap of 3 BTC. To further encourage participation, a referral rewards program offers 5 USDT for each new user referred, up to a maximum of 100 USDT per participant. MEXC Launchpad will focus on selecting high-quality projects, particularly in trending and high-growth sectors such as Real World Assets, AI, and the TON ecosystem. Each project is evaluated in collaboration with MEXC Ventures, which provides further support and funding to help innovative ideas scale. Most significantly, no venture capital or KOL pools exist within MEXC Launchpad. All allocations happen on-chain, using a transparent algorithm based solely on each user’s actual contribution. This removes the structural favoritism that has plagued traditional launchpads. “We believe innovation should be accessible to everyone,” MEXC’s Jin said. “You shouldn’t have to be a whale, influencer, or VC to get early access to good projects. Our goal is to level the playing field and empower all users to access high-quality projects at favorable terms. With the new Launchpad, we’re making it easier for real users to engage with real innovation, without the usual barriers or preferential treatment.” As the crypto market continues to heat up, MEXC Launchpad offers something rare: a chance for everyday users to participate in the next wave of innovation, without being pushed aside by insiders. About MEXC Founded in 2018, MEXC is committed to being “Your Easiest Way to Crypto.” Serving over 40 million users across 170+ countries, MEXC is known for its broad selection of trending tokens, everyday airdrop opportunities, and low trading fees. Our user-friendly platform is designed to support both new traders and experienced investors, offering secure and efficient access to digital assets. MEXC prioritizes simplicity and innovation, making crypto trading more accessible and rewarding.

The backlash erupted after Pi Network ( PI ) issued new wallet security guidelines, urging users to protect their seed phrases. Rather than easing concerns, the update sparked renewed outrage. Many users, who claim they followed every instruction from the Pi Core Team, say their wallets still show zero balance. Several posts on X highlight blank wallets, prompting allegations of technical failure and even accusations of a scam. One particularly vocal user, Haifeng Chen, summed up the mood in a heated reply to a post by Pi Network, stating; “Give me back that damn Pi. I’ve worked hard for six years. You still haven’t mapped it. What’s the delay?” His frustration was echoed by others who reported repeated delays and a lack of transparency from the team. For some, the issue is made worse by the appearance of multiple wallet addresses under a single account, adding to the confusion and raising doubts about the reliability of the migration system. https://twitter.com/clarkron_2008/status/1931868439725195537?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw You might also like: Will the Pi Network coin price rise or fall in June? Although the Pi Core Team has emphasized ongoing efforts to resolve these issues, their latest communications have done little to reassure the community. Users continue to demand clear explanations, faster resolution timelines, and immediate access to the tokens they believe they’ve rightfully earned. The continuous lack of visibility regarding the migration status has seriously eroded trust, and many users are now anticipating a rumored Phase 2 update that may finally address the KYC delays and wallet balance discrepancies. However, the absence of a precise timeline has left the community in a state of uncertainty. Pi is down 1.5% over the last day, trading at $0.6286 as of press time. From a technical perspective, the outlook remains fragile . On the daily chart, Pi is consolidating below major moving averages, with the 20-day simple moving average acting as resistance at $0.70.

The overall setup shows indecision, even though indicators such as the stochastic RSI point to the possibility of a bounce. The risk of a further decline toward the $0.55 support zone remains if Pi is unable to break above the $0.70 level and maintain buying support.

CEO Brian Armstrong acknowledged the issue in a June 6 post on X, calling account freezes a “major issue” that had persisted “for longer than is acceptable.” He said resolving it has become a priority for the company. “The issue has been reduced by 82% so far, with more improvements coming,” Armstrong said. He also encouraged users still affected to contact Coinbase Support. Coinbase Tries to Rebuild Trust After Long-Standing Account Freeze Issues The improvements come after years of frustration among users, some of whom reported being locked out for extended periods with limited ability to reach support. Many cited abrupt freezes with no clear explanation, while others reported abandoning the platform altogether due to poor service and a lack of recourse. Account freezing has been a major issue at Coinbase for longer than is acceptable. I could list a bunch of the underlying reasons why it got so bad in the first place, but what's more important is that we've made it a priority to fix, and we have been making good progress. Shout… https://t.co/Emrq6KQhpD — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) June 6, 2025 These challenges have contributed to eroding user confidence, compounded recently by a data breach that exposed personal details of over 70,000 customers . Armstrong credited the progress to Dor Levi, a recent hire on the Coinbase product team. Levi, who joined nine weeks ago, said the company had invested heavily in upgrading its machine learning models and internal infrastructure. These changes improved the accuracy of automated systems that flag accounts for potential violations, thereby reducing false positives and unnecessary restrictions. System Fixes Continue but Users Say Customer Service Still Falls Short While the company aims to minimize disruptions, Armstrong and Levi noted that some freezes will continue in cases involving legal obligations, sanctions, or fraud prevention. Still, Levi admitted that Coinbase’s handling of account access “doesn’t meet [his] own bar,” and pledged further refinement. The public response remains mixed. In replies to Armstrong’s post, some users said they remain locked out, with one claiming to have been denied access to their account for over two years. Another said they left the exchange after an eight-month freeze. Others complained about difficulty reaching human support, echoing a long-running complaint about customer service delays. The timing of the update follows scrutiny over Coinbase’s handling of a data breach disclosed in May. According to Reuters, attackers bribed overseas support contractors last December to obtain access to sensitive user information, including government-issued ID and home addresses. Exchange Tries to Reset, But Consistency and Transparency Will Be the Real Test So, can Coinbase win back trader trust? The 82% reduction is a meaningful start. However, trust in crypto is hard-won and easily lost. For many retail users who left after prolonged freezes, one announcement is not enough. They need consistent action to believe the change is real. What matters now is whether Coinbase follows through with consistent improvements, transparent communication, and a more responsive support system. As the largest custodian of spot Bitcoin ETFs and a major US exchange with over 100m users, Coinbase has much at stake. The company’s efforts to resolve user pain points are being closely watched, both by retail traders and also by regulators and institutions evaluating the security and reliability of crypto infrastructure.

An engine symbiotic to the users’ discovery journey from intent straight to the outcome. TrueNorth’s agentic technology continuously scans across chains, socials, and macro and project data to surface timely, high-signal insights for every user personalized to their portfolio, trading style, and past behavior. “We see true AI agents becoming the foundation for how people invest in crypto for the future,” said Willy Chuang and Alex Lee, co-founders of TrueNorth. “The market is only getting more complex, and our goal is to cut through the noise with a hyper-personalized engine powered by a generative user interface (known as Gen UI) that adapts to each user's style and behavior in real-time. We're building a system where the agnetic flow and expert distilled reinforcement learning models work quietly in the background, driving the user’s intent infinitely closer to the outcome.

""Having led crypto exchanges and worked closely with a broad range of traders and investors, I’ve seen how fragmented data and constant noise creates friction in decision-making,” said Chuang. “TrueNorth is built to simplify this, delivering personalized insights that evolve with each user so they can move faster with more confidence.” For his part, Alex Lee, a PhD in AI, highlighted the platform’s AI-driven approach and ongoing development phase. “AI has reached a point where it can do more than just process data; it can understand context, adapt to users, and continuously improve decision-making,” said Lee. “That’s the foundation we’re building on: agentic intelligence that works behind the scenes to surface what matters most. We’re currently in closed beta, working closely with early users to refine a system that feels intuitive but is powered by serious intelligence.” TrueNorth’s backers, Bryan Pellegrino of LayerZero, Jeff Feng of SEI, Jordi Alexander of Selini Capital, and Yongjin of Presto Labs, as well as Will Wang of Generative Ventures, share a strong belief in AI’s transformative power in crypto trading. Their interests span key themes such as interoperability, data-driven AI models, algorithmic market strategies, and innovative infrastructure development. Together, these interests reflect not only a shared belief in AI’s potential but also the same principles driving TrueNorth’s mission to simplify and personalize decision-making in decentralized markets. TrueNorth, a platform under Singapore-registered Advent AI, is working closely with its first 500 early users, the Truthsayers, to refine agentic workflows for AI-native investing in closed beta.

Teaming up with Web3 Salon, a project supported by JETRO (Japan External Trade Organization) and powered by Asia Web3 Alliance Japan—Ripple, is launching a structured program to support emerging Web3 startups focused on building real-world solutions on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Fueling Startups with Strategic Grants At the core of the partnership is Ripple’s grant program, which offers up to $200,000 per project to Japanese startups working on XRPL use cases, such as DeFi, tokenized real-world assets, and digital payments. The funding comes through Ripple’s Japan & Korea Fund, a branch of its broader $1 billion XRP ecosystem commitment launched in 2022. Selected projects will also receive access to Ripple’s global network of investors, advisors, and technical mentors, providing more than just capital, but also deep ecosystem integration and long-term business guidance. Web3 Salon to Lead Mentorship and Market Readiness While Ripple handles funding and builds connections with new startups, Web3 Salon will focus on founder development. Meanwhile, Web3 Salon will take care of startup founders to grow and succeed. That means giving them mentorship, connecting them to investors, helping them follow Japan’s strict rules, and guiding them on how to launch and grow their business. With Japan’s strong but complex regulatory environment, the partnership aims to make it easier for startups to thrive in the country’s tech-driven economy. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP News Today: Ripple Transfers $498M to Unknown Wallet , Major Events Planned Through March 2026 WrathofKahneman , a well-known XRPL community member, confirmed this partnership ties directly into Ripple’s broader Asian expansion strategy.

The crypto exchange announced the launch of wrapped XRP and Dogecoin on its Layer-2 Base network, giving holders access to decentralized finance (DeFi) opportunities. At the same time, CEO Brian Armstrong reported an 82% reduction in unnecessary account freezes, addressing a long-standing user concern through improved machine learning infrastructure. Coinbase Slashes Account Freezes by 82% Amid Growing User Pressure and Data Breach Fallout Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says the company has made major strides in solving one of its most persistent and controversial issues: unnecessary user account freezes. In a June 6 post on X, Armstrong revealed that the crypto exchange has successfully reduced such incidents by 82%, attributing the improvement to recent internal changes and new investments in technology. “For longer than is acceptable, account restrictions have been a major pain point for Coinbase users,” Armstrong admitted. “We’ve now made it a top priority to fix it.” He added that the company is continuing to roll out improvements and encouraged users with frozen accounts to contact Coinbase Support directly. For years, Coinbase users have complained about sudden and prolonged account freezes—often without clear explanations. Many said they were locked out of their funds for months, and in some cases, even years. These restrictions led to widespread user dissatisfaction, with some customers abandoning the platform altogether. One X user, responding to Armstrong’s post, claimed they had been locked out for over two years, while another described enduring an eight-month freeze before giving up on Coinbase entirely. A common theme in these accounts is frustration with Coinbase’s customer service infrastructure. “It is extremely hard to speak to a live customer service person,” one user wrote. “It can take forever to track someone down.” This customer service bottleneck has been compounded by another major blow to user trust: a recent data breach that compromised the personal details of over 70,000 Coinbase accounts. Illicit actors reportedly bribed overseas customer support agents to gain access to sensitive information such as government-issued IDs and home addresses. The breach occurred in December 2024 but was only disclosed in mid-May 2025. Machine Learning and Internal Reforms Coinbase credits much of the improvement in account freeze issues to new machine learning models and infrastructure upgrades spearheaded by Dor Levi, a product team member who joined the company just nine weeks ago. In a separate X post, Levi explained that Coinbase had made “significant investments” to enhance the precision and recall of its fraud detection and compliance models. These efforts have directly resulted in fewer account restrictions and false positives. Despite these advancements, both Armstrong and Levi emphasized that Coinbase will continue to impose account restrictions when legally required—such as in response to court orders or government sanctions—to remain in compliance with international laws. Coinbase is also under intense scrutiny following revelations about a major data leak that exposed customer identities. According to reports, bad actors bribed international contractors to access Coinbase’s support systems, allowing them to download ID photos and sensitive contact information. The fallout from this breach has been severe. One user claimed that a family friend lost both Bitcoin and Ether in a scam they believe was connected to the incident. Armstrong previously addressed the breach in a May 15 X post, promising that Coinbase would be “significantly strengthening” its internal controls and agent access protocols. The Stakes Are High With over 100 million registered users, Coinbase remains one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world. It is also the primary custodian for spot Bitcoin ETFs, making its operational integrity a crucial matter not just for individual users but also for institutional investors. The company’s move to fix account freezes could go a long way toward restoring user trust, but only if followed through with consistent action. For now, the 82% reduction is a promising sign, but the platform’s critics are likely to remain skeptical until the remaining 18% of issues are also addressed and security practices are fully overhauled. Coinbase Brings XRP and Dogecoin to DeFi on Base With New Wrapped Tokens In related news, Coinbase , has also taken a major step toward expanding the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem on its Layer-2 blockchain, Base. The company announced last week that wrapped versions of XRP and Dogecoin—cbXRP and cbDOGE—are now live on the Base network, opening the door for millions of token holders to generate yield through DeFi strategies. This development allows holders of the original XRP and DOGE assets to earn returns from decentralized applications (dApps) without having to leave the Coinbase ecosystem. It’s a powerful blend of accessibility, interoperability, and scalability—three key pillars Coinbase has touted as central to Base’s vision since its launch. A New Frontier for XRP and Dogecoin Wrapped tokens are tokenized representations of cryptocurrencies that exist on networks where they are not natively supported. In this case, cbXRP and cbDOGE are ERC-20 compliant tokens on Base, backed 1:1 by their underlying assets, which Coinbase holds in secure custody. This ensures the wrapped tokens are fully collateralized and redeemable. XRP, best known as the payments token powering Ripple’s cross-border settlement rails, and Dogecoin, the meme-born cryptocurrency that has developed a robust following and ecosystem, both historically lacked deep integration with Ethereum-compatible DeFi ecosystems. Base’s introduction of wrapped versions now changes that. Coinbase said the move allows holders to participate in yield farming, liquidity provision, lending, and other DeFi protocols natively available on Base. Importantly, it means users can retain exposure to XRP and DOGE while layering on additional sources of yield. Within just 24 hours of their launch, cbXRP and cbDOGE saw strong market interest. Data from blockchain explorer BaseScan shows that cbXRP surpassed a $5 million market cap, while cbDOGE is approaching the $2 million mark. These rapid inflows suggest significant demand from token holders eager to unlock new use cases beyond simple holding or trading. The adoption of wrapped tokens for DeFi use is not new—Coinbase previously launched wrapped Bitcoin (cbETH and later cbBTC) on Base in September 2024, which has now grown into a major asset on the chain with a market cap of over $4.7 billion. With the success of cbBTC as a precedent, cbXRP and cbDOGE are expected to follow a similar growth trajectory, especially as Base becomes a more attractive hub for DeFi applications and developer activity. Why Base? Launched by Coinbase in early 2023, Base is a Layer-2 network built on the OP Stack, developed by Optimism. The network was created to offer a scalable, low-cost, and developer-friendly alternative to Ethereum’s mainnet while staying compatible with the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Base has been instrumental in Coinbase’s strategy to bridge centralized finance (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). By bringing wrapped assets onto Base, Coinbase is ensuring that even holders of non-EVM-native assets like XRP and DOGE can participate in Web3 without the traditional pain points of complex bridging or high fees. In doing so, Coinbase is also strengthening Base’s positioning against other Layer-2 contenders such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync. For XRP and Dogecoin communities, the move represents a major step forward in utility expansion. While XRP has long been used in traditional financial infrastructure through RippleNet and its ODL (On-Demand Liquidity) product, its availability in DeFi has been limited. Dogecoin, often dismissed as a meme coin, has steadily carved out a real presence in the market, backed by a passionate user base and integration into tipping systems and merchant payments. Its new wrapped version could reinvigorate interest from developers and DeFi projects looking to capture Dogecoin’s broad user appeal. Both tokens now stand to benefit from liquidity pools, lending markets, staking derivatives, and DEX listings that can dramatically increase their functionality and relevance in the current DeFi landscape. The Bigger Picture Coinbase’s continued expansion into wrapped assets and Base integration is part of a broader strategic pivot toward Web3 infrastructure and passive income services. As traditional trading revenues face pressure from competition and regulation, DeFi and on-chain products represent a growth avenue for the exchange. By offering a seamless pathway for retail and institutional users to explore DeFi with familiar assets like XRP, DOGE, and BTC, Coinbase is reducing the technical and psychological friction that has long slowed DeFi’s adoption.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-09 05:00:00

The founders of LayerZero, SEI, Selini Capital, Virtuals, Plume, and Presto Labs have collectively backed an AI platform that uses autonomous agents and real-time data to uncover crypto opportunities. AI-focused firm TrueNorth, co-founded by former WOO COO Willy Chuang and ex-Temasek AI tech investor Alex Lee, has raised $1 million in funding to develop Crypto’s first AI-powered engine. An engine symbiotic to the users’ discovery journey from intent straight to the outcome. TrueNorth’s agentic technology continuously scans across chains, socials, and macro and project data to surface timely, high-signal insights for every user personalized to their portfolio, trading style, and past behavior. “We see true AI agents becoming the foundation for how people invest in crypto for the future,” said Willy Chuang and Alex Lee, co-founders of TrueNorth. “The market is only getting more complex, and our goal is to cut through the noise with a hyper-personalized engine powered by a generative user interface (known as Gen UI) that adapts to each user’s style and behavior in real-time. We’re building a system where the agnetic flow and expert distilled reinforcement learning models work quietly in the background, driving the user’s intent infinitely closer to the outcome. Willy Chuang, who previously led operations at the CeFi/DeFi exchange WOO, emphasized the real-world need for tools that reduce cognitive overload in fast-moving markets. “Having led crypto exchanges and worked closely with a broad range of traders and investors, I’ve seen how fragmented data and constant noise creates friction in decision-making,” said Chuang. “TrueNorth is built to simplify this, delivering personalized insights that evolve with each user so they can move faster with more confidence.” For his part, Alex Lee, a PhD in AI, highlighted the platform’s AI-driven approach and ongoing development phase. “AI has reached a point where it can do more than just process data; it can understand context, adapt to users, and continuously improve decision-making,” said Lee. “That’s the foundation we’re building on: agentic intelligence that works behind the scenes to surface what matters most. We’re currently in closed beta, working closely with early users to refine a system that feels intuitive but is powered by serious intelligence.” TrueNorth’s backers, Bryan Pellegrino of LayerZero, Jeff Feng of SEI, Jordi Alexander of Selini Capital, and Yongjin of Presto Labs, as well as Will Wang of Generative Ventures, share a strong belief in AI’s transformative power in crypto trading. Their interests span key themes such as interoperability, data-driven AI models, algorithmic market strategies, and innovative infrastructure development. Together, these interests reflect not only a shared belief in AI’s potential but also the same principles driving TrueNorth’s mission to simplify and personalize decision-making in decentralized markets. TrueNorth, a platform under Singapore-registered Advent AI, is working closely with its first 500 early users, the Truthsayers, to refine agentic workflows for AI-native investing in closed beta. In the coming weeks, the team will unveil key details of its advanced architecture and agentic frameworks as it gears up for a public launch aimed at delivering smarter, hyper-personalized crypto discovery tools to a wider audience.

The founders of LayerZero, SEI, Selini Capital, Virtuals, Plume, and Presto Labs have collectively backed an AI platform that uses autonomous agents and real-time data to uncover crypto opportunities. AI-focused firm TrueNorth, co-founded by former WOO COO Willy Chuang and ex-Temasek AI tech investor Alex Lee, has raised $1 million in funding to develop Crypto’s first AI-powered engine. An engine symbiotic to the users’ discovery journey from intent straight to the outcome. TrueNorth’s agentic technology continuously scans across chains, socials, and macro and project data to surface timely, high-signal insights for every user personalized to their portfolio, trading style, and past behavior. “We see true AI agents becoming the foundation for how people invest in crypto for the future,” said Willy Chuang and Alex Lee, co-founders of TrueNorth. “The market is only getting more complex, and our goal is to cut through the noise with a hyper-personalized engine powered by a generative user interface (known as Gen UI) that adapts to each user's style and behavior in real-time. We're building a system where the agnetic flow and expert distilled reinforcement learning models work quietly in the background, driving the user’s intent infinitely closer to the outcome. Willy Chuang, who previously led operations at the CeFi/DeFi exchange WOO, emphasized the real-world need for tools that reduce cognitive overload in fast-moving markets. ""Having led crypto exchanges and worked closely with a broad range of traders and investors, I’ve seen how fragmented data and constant noise creates friction in decision-making,” said Chuang. “TrueNorth is built to simplify this, delivering personalized insights that evolve with each user so they can move faster with more confidence.” For his part, Alex Lee, a PhD in AI, highlighted the platform’s AI-driven approach and ongoing development phase. “AI has reached a point where it can do more than just process data; it can understand context, adapt to users, and continuously improve decision-making,” said Lee. “That’s the foundation we’re building on: agentic intelligence that works behind the scenes to surface what matters most. We’re currently in closed beta, working closely with early users to refine a system that feels intuitive but is powered by serious intelligence.” TrueNorth’s backers, Bryan Pellegrino of LayerZero, Jeff Feng of SEI, Jordi Alexander of Selini Capital, and Yongjin of Presto Labs, as well as Will Wang of Generative Ventures, share a strong belief in AI’s transformative power in crypto trading. Their interests span key themes such as interoperability, data-driven AI models, algorithmic market strategies, and innovative infrastructure development. Together, these interests reflect not only a shared belief in AI’s potential but also the same principles driving TrueNorth’s mission to simplify and personalize decision-making in decentralized markets. TrueNorth, a platform under Singapore-registered Advent AI, is working closely with its first 500 early users, the Truthsayers, to refine agentic workflows for AI-native investing in closed beta. In the coming weeks, the team will unveil key details of its advanced architecture and agentic frameworks as it gears up for a public launch aimed at delivering smarter, hyper-personalized crypto discovery tools to a wider audience.

45707426,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=743012,1749445601,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45707426.jpeg,Sam Altman’s Worldcoin has started using eye-scanning kiosks in several UK cities,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/sam-altmans-eye-scan-orbs-hit-uk-streets/,"Sam Altman’s World (formerly Worldcoin) project has launched its biometric eye‑scanning kiosks across the UK. Tools for Humanity, the startup co-founded by Altman, is bringing its futuristic eye-scanning Orbs to the UK as part of a broader global expansion of its identity verification platform. The project will give Brits access to verification services that entrepreneurs claim are essential to distinguish between human and artificial intelligence. Starting this week, residents in London, Manchester, Birmingham, Cardiff, Belfast, and Glasgow can scan their eyes using the company’s proprietary Orb devices, the company announced on Monday. The team seeks to expand the project scope, which made its US debut in April. World targets UK high streets with AI-driven identity verification According to Damien Kieran, Chief Legal and Privacy Officer at Tools for Humanity, the spherical Orbs will initially be located at dedicated premises in shopping centers and on high streets. The company also plans to partner with major retailers to install self-service Orbs similar to ATMs. “The UK is certainly one of the more influential markets in the world . . . it punches well above its weight globally,” said Adrian Ludwig, chief architect at Tools for Humanity, the primary developer behind World. He points out that the UK population is highly connected and already acutely aware of AI’s growing influence. Adria says in the UK, more than 75% of people report being impacted by AI almost daily. Project leaders warn that artificial intelligence is quickly approaching a point where it can convincingly mimic humans—largely due to advances made by companies like Altman’s own OpenAI. They predict that 90% of online content could be machine-generated within two years, making it increasingly difficult to tell the difference between humans and AI. Founded in 2019 by Altman and Alex Blania, Tools for Humanity has raised over $300 million from prominent backers such as Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, and Sam Bankman-Fried, the now-imprisoned founder of FTX. In May, the group raised an additional $135 million from investors, including Andreessen Horowitz and Bain Capital Crypto, to fund further orb development and international expansion. Tools for Humanity promotes its technology to distinguish humans from increasingly sophisticated AI systems. As generative AI tools—such as those developed by Altman’s OpenAI—proliferate, the risk of deepfakes, identity theft, and misinformation grows. The Orb scan generates a digital credential called World ID, based on the unique characteristics of a user’s iris. Those who opt-in can also receive the Worldcoin cryptocurrency token. Although the project currently has no revenue, World is exploring monetization options, including charging fees to partner platforms—such as dating apps like those under the Match Group umbrella—that use World ID services. World’s leadership sees the technology as a critical defense against digital fraud, AI impersonation, and automated misuse of online platforms—from bots buying up concert tickets to fake profiles infiltrating dating apps. Privacy concerns and global scrutiny shadow World’s expansion However, the project has not been without controversy. Regulatory authorities in Germany and Argentina have launched investigations over privacy concerns , while Spain and Hong Kong have issued outright bans. The company insists it does not store personal or biometric data; instead, verification data remains solely on the user’s device. Kieran said Tools for Humanity has been working ahead of its UK rollout with privacy regulators, including the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office. About 13 million people in countries like Mexico, Germany, Japan, Korea, Portugal, and Thailand have verified their identities through the technology. In April, the company announced expansion plans for six US cities. Currently, 1,500 Orbs are circulating globally, but Tools for Humanity aims to produce and ship an additional 12,000 devices over the next year.

The company announced on a June 9 blog post that it has partnered with Web3 Salon, a project supported by Japan’s External Trade Organization and powered by the Asia Web3 Alliance Japan, to provide targeted support for startups building on the XRP ( XRP ) Ledger. Through this program, Ripple will offer up to $200,000 per project over the next year. The grants will go to startups working on use cases like decentralized finance, tokenized real-world assets, and digital payments. This effort is part of Ripple’s Japan and Korea Fund and ties into a larger plan to support XRPL developers with financial, technical, and business help. The grant process will be managed directly by Ripple, which will select projects according to their technical quality, potential for growth, and fit with its objectives. Selected startups will receive funding as well as access to Ripple’s global network of partners and experts. You might also like: Japan eyes stricter crypto rules targeting insider trading: report Taking the lead in founder support, Web3 Salon will provide networking opportunities, workshops, and advice. Its goal will be to help startups grow, build stronger products, and connect with investors and regulators. Four community events through March 2026 are also part of the partnership. Startup pitches, investor sessions, panel discussions, and educational workshops on subjects like cross-border expansion and compliance will all be included in these events. Despite its clear crypto regulations and strong tech talent, Japan remains a difficult place for startups. Web3 Salon and Ripple hope to reduce the entry barrier and facilitate the growth and expansion of new teams. This move comes at a time when Ripple’s popularity in Japan continues to grow. The country’s clear legal framework for digital assets has attracted major players like SBI Holdings, a key Ripple partner and one of the most vocal supporters of XRP. SBI Remit, the biggest money transfer company in Japan, already uses RippleNet for international payments. Its cryptocurrency division, SBI VC Trade, allows institutional and retail customers to trade XRP. Meanwhile, major platforms like Mercari have started offering XRP to users through their apps, and large companies like Open House Group now accept XRP for real estate purchases. With support from Ripple, Web3 Salon, and JETRO, this new initiative could give Japan’s Web3 scene a meaningful push and help bring new ideas to life on the XRP Ledger.

Additionally, crypto markets have settled a little following the volatility in the wake of the spat between US President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk late last week. However, some of that may return this week when key inflation and consumer sentiment reports are released. On top of this, the next round of US-China trade talks is scheduled to begin on Monday, commented the Kobeissi Letter. Economic Events June 9 to 13 The most impactful report of the week is May’s Consumer Price Index CPI which is one of the two key measures of inflation. Central bank policymakers and investors closely monitor the CPI report as it reflects price trends across the economy and shapes sentiment. The May CPI report is likely to confirm that price pressures remain elevated, according to analysts. May’s Producer Price Index (PPI) report will follow the CPI on Thursday, reflecting input costs for producers and manufacturers. PPI measures the cost of producing consumer goods, which ultimately impacts retail prices, and is viewed as a leading indicator of inflationary pressures. June’s Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index and Consumer Inflation Expectations preliminary readings are due on Friday. These reports summarize consumer confidence and long-term inflation expectations, which can impact spending and overall economic growth. Key Events This Week: 1. Atlanta Fed GDPNow data – Monday 2. May CPI Inflation data – Wednesday 3. 10-Year Note Auction -Wednesday 4. May PPI Inflation data – Thursday 5. Michigan Inflation Expectations data – Friday 6. Michigan Consumer Sentiment data – Friday This marks… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) June 8, 2025 This marks the last week of inflation data before the June Fed meeting. According to the CME Fed Watch tool, there is a 99.9% probability that interest rates will remain unchanged at the June 18 central bank meeting. Crypto Market Outlook Crypto markets have dipped a little over the past 24 hours, with a 2% decline in total capitalization, which dropped to $3.41 trillion during Monday morning trading in Asia. Overall, markets remain range-bound bound having recovered from their Friday fall and holding steady over the weekend. Bitcoin topped $106,000 during late trading on Sunday but declined a little to $105,600 on Monday, June 9. Aside from Friday’s dip, it has remained within this tight trading channel since the end of May. Ethereum is holding steady around the $2,500 price zone, failing to break resistance above $2,700 but also not slumping back towards $2,000. Most of the altcoins are generally flat with minor gains for XRP and ICP, and further losses for memecoins.

On Sunday, he posted a chart of the company’s BTC holdings, touting that Strategy aims to increase its Bitcoin purchases. “Send more Orange,” his message read, as Orange is widely recognized as a symbol for Bitcoin among the crypto community. Send more Orange pic.twitter.com/QaLJWkLrVN — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 8, 2025 This marks the firm’s ninth week in a row of buying Bitcoin, if the post follows a potential acquisition. The corporation bought 705 BTC for almost $75 million between May 26 and June 1. The firm currently holds 580,955 BTC, worth approximately $61.4 billion at current values, according to Bitcoin Treasuries data . Michael Saylor has a history of posting on Sundays before his Bitcoin purchases. However, a recent report from K33 Research revealed that Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, appears to have slowed down its Bitcoin buys. This is due to a declining premium for MSTR shares relative to the company’s Bitcoin holdings, K33 Head of Research Vetle Lunde attributed. ’Strategy Is Fully Torqued Bitcoin’: Michael Saylor On June 7, Saylor posted a victorious message on X, sharing an infographic on how Bitcoin has helped Strategy outperform other major tech titans, including Tesla, Meta and Nvidia. “Strategy is fully torqued Bitcoin,” he wrote on X, with a 126% increase in terms of a year return growth.

Per the announcement, the company aims to issue 11,764,700 shares of 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock, at a public offering price of $85.00 per share. “Strategy intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and for working capital,” the announcement read. Bitcoin Treasury Race Heats Up: What Could Be Next? Following Strategy’s lead, there has been an intensifying competition among corporations entering the Bitcoin treasury space. Japan’s Metaplanet, for instance, has been stochpiling Bitcoin continuously, with a new target to accumulate 210,000 BTC by 2027 . The Tokyo-listed investment firm currently holds 8,888 BTC, placing it tenth globally in corporate Bitcoin holdings. Michael Saylor’s Sunday endorsement could signal sustained positive sentiment among traders and potentially increase institutional accumulation. Though, monitoring Saylor’s social activity could be relevant for short-term trading strategies, as institutional sentiment could lead to price volatility.

Market participants also turned their attention to upcoming US-China trade talks , senior officials from the U.S. and China are set to begin a new round of talks in London today, signaling easing trade tensions. Gold prices dropped to around $3,300 per ounce on Monday, marking a third consecutive session of decline and reaching its lowest level in a week. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.89% to above 38,000 while the broader Topix Index gained 0.7% to 2,788 on Monday, with Japanese shares rising for the second straight session. The Japanese yen appreciated past 144.5 per US dollar on Monday, rebounding after two consecutive days of losses, as revised data showed the country’s first-quarter GDP was flat. Japan's economy was flat in the first quarter —an improvement from the previously reported 0.2% contraction. While the revision was positive, it still marked a notable slowdown from the 0.6% growth seen in the final quarter of 2024. Adding to the mixed economic picture, Japan’s current account surplus narrowed in April and came in below market expectations. The gauge for Japan’s service sector rose to 44.4 in May 2025, up from 42.6 in the previous month — its lowest level since February 2022 — and above market expectations of 43.9. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.33% to above 3,390 while the Shenzhen Component gained 0.9% to 10,277 on Monday, with mainland stocks reaching multi-week highs as officials from Beijing and Washington are set to resume trade negotiations in London later today, and the offshore yuan strengthened to around 7.18 per dollar on Monday, ending a two-session losing streak, supported by potential easing of US-China trade tensions that overshadowed deflationary concerns. Meanwhile, deepening deflationary concerns pressured yields as China’s consumer prices fell for a fourth straight month and producer prices saw their steepest drop in nearly two years. Separately, the latest trade data revealed a decline in imports, driven by weak consumption. Although export growth missed forecasts even with a temporary US trade truce, the country still achieved a $103 billion surplus, surpassing estimates.

Here’s how,https://timestabloid.com/you-can-borrow-against-xrp-to-buy-real-estate-and-be-your-own-bank-heres-how/,"Crypto commentator MrAQUAMAN33 has presented a concept of financial independence through the use of digital assets, specifically XRP, in the acquisition of real estate. In a post on X, he wrote, “XRP Millionaire? Borrow Against Crypto to Buy Real Estate! BE YOUR OWN BANK.” He captioned a video in which the speaker elaborates on a potential strategy for leveraging digital assets without the need to liquidate them. The video references a comment from someone named Sergei, who posed the idea of earning yield from the equity in a property. The speaker responds by clarifying this idea and addressing skepticism, stating that viewers should not be dismissive. $XRP Millionaire? Borrow Against Crypto to Buy Real Estate! BE YOUR OWN BANK pic.twitter.com/ZnXf2wSfan — Mr.AquaMan.33𝕏 (@MrAQUAMAN33) June 7, 2025 Using XRP as Collateral Through Metal X Lending The speaker proposes a hypothetical scenario in which an individual becomes a multimillionaire through XRP holdings. In this example, the person owns $10 million worth of XRP . Rather than selling the digital asset to access funds, the individual uses a decentralized, non-custodial protocol—Metal X Lending—to borrow against their XRP holdings. He explains that this lending platform allows the user to access capital by using their XRP as collateral, with no set repayment timeframe and minimal interest costs, described as “usually a sliver of a percent to pay it back.” With this approach, the individual can borrow, for example, $2 million to purchase a cash home, without selling any XRP. The transaction is described as a self-issued loan using one’s crypto assets. Tokenizing the Property on Blockchain After acquiring the home with borrowed funds, the next step outlined in the video involves tokenizing the purchased property. The speaker refers to platforms that facilitate this process, specifically naming Lofty, which operates on the Algorand blockchain, and another emerging project, PRYPCO Mint Project. According to him, PRYPCO is a regulated initiative based in Dubai that is developing real estate tokenization on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 He emphasizes that this is not theoretical but an active opportunity, describing PRYPCO’s project as one that participants “can partake in right now.” The concept of tokenized real estate is presented as a key innovation, with the speaker stressing the importance of regulation in PRYPCO’s framework, highlighting its alignment with compliant practices in Dubai’s regulatory environment. A Model for Digital Asset Utility in Traditional Markets This vision presents a strategy for retaining ownership of digital assets while simultaneously using them to gain access to real-world property. By leveraging lending protocols like Metal X Lending, XRP holders could theoretically avoid selling their tokens and instead treat them as collateral. The borrowed funds could be used to make high-value purchases, such as real estate, while the asset is held and potentially continues to appreciate. The second phase, involving tokenization, is framed as a way to integrate the property into the digital asset ecosystem. Through platforms like Lofty or PRYPCO, the tokenized real estate could potentially be fractionalized or yield-generating, depending on the platform’s functionality and regulatory standing. The overall message is directed at individuals who believe in the future value of XRP and other digital assets. The speaker’s position is clear: with the appropriate tools and platforms, holders of crypto assets do not need to rely on traditional banks or liquidate their holdings to access capital or acquire physical assets, such as real estate. Instead, they can “be their own bank,” as the tweet’s caption suggests, by using decentralized protocols and asset tokenization in combination.

A low-priced token appears out of nowhere, gathers a loyal following, and then explodes, creating millionaires in the process. It happened with Bitcoin. It happened with Ethereum. And now, many believe it’s happening again, with a newcomer that might just be the smartest blockchain upgrade we’ve seen: Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S). While the price is still in presale, early investors are already calculating a jaw-dropping 233% return before the token even hits exchanges. Can Bitcoin’s Original Vision Still Compete? Bitcoin is a legend—and rightly so. It introduced the world to decentralized money and a fixed-supply model that revolutionized finance. But despite its strength as digital gold, Bitcoin’s limitations are clear: slow transaction speeds, minimal scalability, and no built-in support for smart contracts. In contrast, Bitcoin Solaris takes that core legacy and injects it with 2025-grade innovation, delivering not just security and scarcity but speed, programmability, and broad usability. The Powerhouse Behind Bitcoin Solaris’s Rise At its heart, Bitcoin Solaris is built for one thing: evolution. It doesn’t aim to replace Bitcoin—it aims to finish what it started. The network uses a dual-layer architecture to solve the trilemma of decentralization, scalability, and speed. The Base Layer runs on SHA-256, the same algorithm that powers Bitcoin, and supports standard mining hardware with a 5-minute block time. Above it, the Solaris Layer operates using Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)—featuring 21 rotating validators, dynamic 32MB blocks, and 15-second confirmations. Together, these layers achieve over 10,000 TPS while staying energy-efficient and secure. And that’s not all. Validator elections, slashing mechanisms, and synchronization between layers ensure stability and fairness across the board. While traditional chains struggle with either speed or security, Bitcoin Solaris bridges both with technical mastery. The Future of Decentralization Is Already Mining—Start with BTC-S Why the Presale Is Gaining Serious Momentum With less than 8 weeks left before its official launch, the Bitcoin Solaris presale is turning heads fast: Current Price: $6 Next Phase: $7 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 10% Over 11,000 users have already joined the presale, and more than $3 million has been raised. This makes it one of the shortest and most explosive presales in recent memory. Investors are chasing a projected 1,900% return, and today marks the final day of Phase 6. The clock is ticking. In a recent in-depth review, Ben Crypto highlighted why so many crypto enthusiasts are calling this the presale of the year, diving into both the scalability and security features that set BTC-S apart. Smart Contracts That Actually Do Something While many chains talk about smart contracts , Bitcoin Solaris builds them for the real world. Rust-based contracts bring enterprise-grade flexibility to the network. DeFi lending, borrowing, tokenized real estate, play-to-earn economies, supply chain tracking—BTC-S supports them all from day one. Here’s what makes it truly special: Rust-based contracts, deployed using Solana’s toolset for seamless developer adoption Cross-chain bridges to connect with Ethereum, Solana, and others Near-instant finality with 2-second confirmation speeds Application support spanning DeFi, gaming, IoT, healthcare, education, and digital identity. The Hidden Wealth Engine Here’s where Bitcoin Solaris really earns its title as the next Bitcoin: mining. But not as you know it. Two-thirds of BTC-S (66.67%) is allocated to mining rewards over time. Mining requires users to hold BTC-S, reducing sell pressure and strengthening long-term value Accessible via desktop, browser, and through the upcoming Solaris Nova app, which is designed for everyday users Unlike traditional systems where whales and server farms dominate, BTC-S distributes opportunity through design. Even holding tokens can power the network and generate returns. It’s a wealth system engineered for mass participation, not just the elite. Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Solaris: What’s Actually Different? Feature Bitcoin Bitcoin Solaris Transaction Speed ~7 TPS 10,000+ TPS Smart Contracts None Full Rust-based support Energy Consumption High 99.95% Lower Validator Governance None On-chain, DPoS validator system Mining Method PoW only PoW + DPoS hybrid Mobile Accessibility None Mining via browser + app Use Case Focus Digital gold Full ecosystem (DeFi, NFTs, etc.) How Bitcoin Solaris Could Make You Rich Bitcoin Solaris isn’t promising overnight riches. It’s offering architecture that rewards smart participation. It’s built with value-holders in mind, not just hype-chasers. With a fixed 21M cap, long-term staking and mining incentives, and a scarcity design straight from Bitcoin’s playbook, it’s not hard to see how early holders could win big. As adoption increases and the ecosystem grows, the upward pressure on BTC-S will come not from marketing—but from function. From holding, using, and participating.

Pavel, what first pulled you into crypto? And how did you become such an early builder and investor specifically within Telegram’s blockchain ecosystem? It was Bitcoin in early 2017 that first pulled me into crypto, but what truly captured my interest was the underlying technology. That curiosity led me to follow Telegram’s blockchain efforts from the early days of the GRAM ICO in 2018. I’ve been tracking it closely ever since. In 2022, I invested in TON, driven by the conviction that its deep integration with Telegram could unlock massive potential. I dove deeper into the ecosystem, and soon began contributing, starting with the launch of the first liquid staking platform on TON in early 2023. That experience paved the way for our next chapter: building TAC. It’s been a natural evolution of our belief in TON and its future as a core part of the Telegram ecosystem. 2.

The numbers reflect routine market adjustments but offer a pulse on investor sentiment heading into mid-2025. BTC Down, ETH Up, USDT Slightly Lower According to the report, Binance users now collectively hold 593,000 BTC, representing a 1.82% drop from May 1. In contrast, Ethereum holdings have risen by 1.05% to 5.337 million ETH, signaling slight investor confidence in ETH despite recent market turbulence. USDT balances saw a mild dip of 0.77%, now totaling 28.83 billion, marking a decline of $223 million over the past month. These figures come amid market fluctuations and ongoing demand for transparency from major exchanges. Binance remains the second-largest crypto reserve holder globally, with approximately $110 billion across BTC, ETH, USDT, and USDC. Coinbase still leads the pack with $129 billion under custody, as noted in earlier reports. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple Launches Japan-Focused Web3 Program Backed by JETRO , BNB Dips Below $650 Post-Report Following the update, Binance’s native token BNB slipped below $650, currently trading at $649.89, despite posting a modest 0.15% gain over 24 hours.

Will an agreement boost confidence in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum? Or could new tensions make prices swing wildly? Let’s see what could happen? US-China Trade Talk Set For Today Recently, U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will meet Chinese officials in London on Monday, June 9, 2025. Meanwhile, China confirmed that Vice Premier He Lifeng will join these discussions. However, this meeting comes after Trump had a “very good talk” with China’s President Xi Jinping last week, the first time they spoke since the trade war began in February. US-China Trade Battle The trade war between the US and China started earlier this year when President Trump raised taxes on products from China by 125% . China fought back with higher taxes on US products, and tensions between the two countries kept growing. At one point, trade tariffs climbed as high as 145%, creating massive uncertainty for businesses and financial markets worldwide. Perhaps, in May, a temporary truce was reached in Switzerland, with the US reducing tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% and China slashing its tariffs to 10%. Trade’s Impact On Crypto Market While all eyes are on these talks, crypto experts have a special reason to watch. In past trade disputes, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have acted as a haven when markets felt shaky. If Monday’s talks go well and the US and China agree to ease trade tensions, it could calm investors and lead to more stable crypto prices. But if talks collapse or tariffs rise again, Bitcoin and altcoins might see a surge as people look for assets that aren’t tied to governments or global politics. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump Coin & Tesla Stock Crash Big Amid Elon Musk & Donald Trump Feud: Here’s What’s Next! , Sentiment Shifting Towards Crypto On top of that, data from Santiment shows that more people are buying crypto than ever.

It currently broke out of a key resistance line and now appears poised for a bullish move on the daily chart. Unlike many other mid-cap altcoins, ICP saw less recovery during the last leg up due to low demand. It subjected the bearish trend to sideways movement and remained relatively indecisive on the weekly chart. The sideways movement came with a correction after managing to tap $6.2 last month, and crypto remained weak again. Luckily for the bulls, the $4.8 level produced support this week and the price bounced back. That led to a three-day surge, and the price broke slightly out of a month resistance line to where it is changing hands at $5.6. This break signals a potential bullish move, and from the look of things, the trend is likely to shift in favour of the bulls soon. Although it is important to note that ICP is still trading inside the bearish zone on a mid-term scale. A clear push above the previous monthly high should set the market up for a big price movement in the short term. Currently, the bears are off the market on the daily scale. If they manage to step back with a pull below the $4 level, we may consider more downtrends on the mid-term scale. But with the current surge in demand level, more positive actions can be expected. ICP’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview The rising leg up is targeted at the $6.37 resistance level. An increase above this level could rally the price to the $7.74 resistance. Above it lies the $9 level. Aside from the $4.8 level recently held as support, the $4.2 level is considered the main support for a dip. A breakdown from there could slide us to $3.5. Key Resistance Levels: $6.37, $7.74, $9 Key Support Levels: $4.8, $4.2, $3.5 Spot Price: $5.64 Trend: Bullish Volatility: Highs Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The decentralized exchange unveiled its post-relaunch strategy in a June 8 blog post , outlining measures to enhance protocol security, upgrade monitoring systems, and transition toward full open-sourcing. A newly structured white hat bounty programme has also been introduced to support community-driven security efforts. According to the team, all affected CLMM pools have now been replenished using a combination of recovered assets, treasury funds, and a $30 million loan from the Sui Foundation. Liquidity providers will regain access to their previous positions, with recovery rates ranging from 85% to 99%, depending on the extent of the damage to each pool. To compensate for unrecovered losses, Cetus has allocated 15% of its native CETUS token supply to affected users. Of this, 5% will be immediately claimable, while the remaining 10% will be unlocked monthly over the next year, starting June 10. The team clarified that the 15% CETUS allocation introduces no new inflation, as it repurposes unvested team tokens within the existing supply cap. Compensation claims will be tied to LP position NFTs, which will remain valid as certificates for CETUS redemption, even after liquidity is withdrawn. The protocol has also completed new security audits covering all code patches, contract upgrades, and the compensation contract. Additional rounds of audits and real-time threat detection upgrades are planned to further strengthen protocol resilience.

In the immediate aftermath, the Cetus team froze operations and began working with Sui validators to recover assets. An on-chain governance vote held on May 29 approved the transfer of $162 million in frozen funds to a multisig wallet for recovery. Further, the Sui Foundation supported the effort with a dedicated USDC loan to backstop off-chain losses. Cetus stated that legal proceedings are ongoing in multiple jurisdictions, with law enforcement agencies actively engaged. The attacker, who declined a $6 million white-hat bounty, is reportedly attempting to launder assets, although the team claims that most movements remain traceable. “We are highly confident that successful arrest and recovering the remaining assets is only a matter of time,” Cetus wrote in the latest announcement. If additional funds are recovered during the compensation period, users will have the option to redeem CETUS for USDC. Once that period ends, remaining funds will be used for token buybacks and deposited into the community treasury. The latest announcement, however, failed to lift CETUS, which fell around 7% on the day, extending a downtrend that began in May.

In fact, Michael Saylor hinted at another purchase after a recent $1 billion stock offering. Meanwhile, the crypto community is pressuring Elon Musk to fully embrace Bitcoin as tensions grow between him and Donald Trump. Bitcoin Family Overhauls Security Didi Taihuttu, the patriarch of the well-known “Bitcoin Family,” implemented a sweeping overhaul of his digital asset security measures in response to the growing wave of violent crimes targeting cryptocurrency holders. The Taihuttu family famously committed to an all-Bitcoin lifestyle in 2017, and took drastic steps to safeguard their crypto assets by spreading their private key information across four continents. In a recent interview with CNBC, Taihuttu revealed that the family no longer relies solely on hardware wallets. Instead, they now employ a hybrid security model that includes blockchain-based storage systems and physically distributed components of their seed phrases. Bitcoin Family According to Taihuttu, their seed phrase has been encrypted, divided into four parts, and stored using a combination of fireproof metal plates and blockchain solutions. These plates are hidden in undisclosed physical locations worldwide. To strengthen the setup even more, Taihuttu altered some of the words in the seed phrase. This means that even if someone were to obtain part of it, they wouldn’t be able to access the assets without knowing the correct contextual modifications. He also pointed out that even under coercion, he could not give away more than what is immediately accessible on his phone or wallet, which contains only a small portion of their holdings. (Source: CNBC ) The shift in strategy happened due to a surge in crypto-linked crimes. Over the past few months, there has been a disturbing increase in kidnappings, extortion, and violent assaults on crypto users around the world. Taihuttu and his family chose to stop posting real-time updates of their travels due to safety concerns, as threats from individuals who tracked their movements online became too serious to ignore. Although the family continues to live a global, nomadic lifestyle, they now take better precautions to shield their movements and protect their digital wealth. Under their new model, about 65% of the family’s crypto assets are secured in cold storage, while their hot wallets, which are used for trading and daily expenses, are guarded using multisignature protocols. Between late 2024 and early 2025, several high-profile cases made headlines across the globe, including a January conviction of gang members in the UK for kidnapping and torturing a crypto investor. There was also a February case in Chicago where six men abducted a family and demanded $15 million in digital assets. In March, popular streamer Kaitlyn Siragusa, who is known online as “Amouranth,” endured a terrifying home invasion where armed intruders demanded crypto transfers. One of the most alarming incidents occurred on May 13 in Paris, when three masked men tried to kidnap the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium. Noizat’s daughter bravely resisted the attackers, and even managed to disarm one of them before bystanders intervened. Strategy Signals New Bitcoin Buy Despite this very concerning rise in crypto-targeted crimes, people and companies are still accumulating Bitcoin. Michael Saylor, the co-founder and executive chairman of Strategy, caused speculation of another major Bitcoin purchase after posting a cryptic message, “Send more Orange,” on X on June 8. Saylor is known for teasing Bitcoin acquisitions through posts like these, and if history repeats, Strategy could soon announce another buy. The timing follows Strategy’s recent acquisition of 705 BTC between May 26 and June 1 for approximately $75 million at an average price of $106,495 per coin. This brought the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 580,955 BTC, which is valued at roughly $61.4 billion. According to SaylorTracker , the firm is currently sitting on an unrealized profit of about $20.6 billion. This is a 50% gain on its Bitcoin investment. Strategy’s aggressive accumulation continues to be fueled by capital raises, with the latest being a $1 billion stock offering . This greatly expands on its initial $250 million raise and is aimed at financing even more Bitcoin purchases as well as general corporate needs. The new offering includes 11.76 million shares of its 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock, priced at $85 each. After expenses, the company expects to net approximately $979 million. The preferred shares feature non-cumulative 10% dividends, appealing to institutional investors seeking yield while giving Strategy predictable financing to deepen its Bitcoin exposure. The company’s bold approach makes it the largest known Bitcoin holder in the world, surpassing even the combined Bitcoin reserves of the United States and China. Strategy’s holdings are nearly 12 times bigger than those of the second-largest public Bitcoin holder, mining firm Mara Holdings. As a result, many investors now see Strategy as a de facto Bitcoin ETF alternative that offers direct exposure to the asset through corporate equity. Elon Musk Pressured to Go All In on Bitcoin Members of the Bitcoin community are also urging Tesla CEO Elon Musk to go all in on Bitcoin as tensions escalate between Musk and US President Donald Trump. The public feud became a lightning rod for crypto advocates, who see it as an opportunity for Musk to strike back by embracing Bitcoin more aggressively. Crypto analyst Will Clemente posted on X that “the best way for Elon to get back at Trump is by full porting Bitcoin.” JAN3 CEO Samson Mow directly called on Musk to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy and resume accepting BTC for Tesla purchases. Mow also suggested that Musk’s space venture, SpaceX, offer launch discounts to customers who pay in Bitcoin. He said that it’s time to “force a hard money standard on the money printers.” This follows his criticism of Trump for failing to follow through after signing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve executive order. He also pointed out that the US has yet to acquire more Bitcoin and risks falling behind other nations. Mow even warned Musk to act before facing potential financial restrictions, and suggested that “at least do it before they freeze your fiat assets.” Others in the crypto space speculated that if Musk truly committed to Bitcoin, it would be on a massive scale. Boyd Cohen , CEO of Lomob, said Musk would likely pursue the biggest BTC treasury in the world and integrate Bitcoin across all his companies. He added that Musk could emerge as a leading global advocate for Bitcoin. The backdrop to this renewed push for Musk’s Bitcoin alignment is a growing personal and political rift with Trump. Their feud reignited after Musk publicly criticized Trump’s tax bill on June 3 by calling it a “disgusting abomination,” and intensified when Musk warned that Trump’s proposed global tariffs could trigger a recession later this year. In response, Trump claimed that canceling Musk’s federal subsidies and contracts could save the government billions of dollars. Musk has long shown interest in cryptocurrency,and recently announced that X will roll out XChats , a messaging feature with “Bitcoin-style encryption.” Although Tesla discontinued Bitcoin payments in 2021 due to environmental concerns, the company still holds digital assets, though the value of its holdings fell from $1.076 billion to $951 million in the first quarter of this year.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-09 06:14:06

In a new strategy session, pseudonymous analyst Cheds tells his 49,700 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin looks strong on the weekly chart after breaking out from a cup-and-handle pattern. In technical analysis, a cup-and-handle pattern is a bullish continuation structure indicating that an asset is primed to move higher after a period of consolidation. The second bullish signal, according to Cheds, is that the uptrend appears technically sound based on how much time Bitcoin spent forming a solid base between $16,000 and $70,000. And third, the trader says the depth of the consolidation range in the last three years is likely enough to sustain rallies above $200,000 in 2026. “It’s still my base case, and this is just a very general outline. I think we have a pretty good chance of mid-$250,000 in 2026. That seems kind of aggressive, I know. But the funny thing is that this has been a conservative target for some people because people are talking about [hitting $250,000] this year. Absolutely not. That’s crazy… There is zero chance of $250,000 this year, but I think it’s a decent chance of mid-$250,000 just based on the height of the cup-and-handle [pattern], and the time interval and the consolidation range… That’s still my general idea, just based on the weekly trajectory.” Source: Cheds/YouTube At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $105,706.

He described the concerns as partly a marketing tactic by those promoting new quantum concept tokens. Saylor believes that major firms like Google and Microsoft would not support the development of quantum computers that could break modern encryption. He argued that such developments could undermine the security of their systems and operations. Saylor expects Bitcoin to counter quantum threat with software upgrades NEW‼️- ARE YOU WORRIED QUANTUM COMPUTING WILL BREAK BITCOIN? 💥 MICHAEL SAYLOR: pic.twitter.com/CVeFWXML4H — Neil Jacobs (@NeilJacobs) June 6, 2025 BlackRock considers Quantum computers, with their ability to outperform classical binary computers and break traditional encryption, a threat to crypto. Michael Saylor dismissed Quantum’s threat to Bitcoin, saying that the BTC protocol would implement a software upgrade when the threat becomes imminent. Saylor responded to concerns about the threat of computers soon being able to break the encryption that enables the scarcity of Bitcoin. He also believes that major tech companies can’t sell to customers a computer that can breach BTC’s cryptography because it would destroy them and the entire banking industry. “It’s mainly marketing from people that want to sell you the next quantum yo-yo token. Google and Microsoft aren’t going to sell you a computer that cracks modern cryptography because it would destroy Google and Microsoft – and the U.S. Government and the banking system.” -Michael Saylor, CEO at Strategy. The quantum sector has had several proposals about how to secure Proof of Work against the quantum threat, including from BTQ Technologies, a startup building quantum-proof crypto hardware. One BTC developer has also introduced a draft Bitcoin Improvement Protocol that proposes a hard fork to move everyone’s wallets to quantum-secure addresses. Saylor argued that the bigger security threat for Bitcoin is phishing, noting that the digital asset is a protocol that gets upgraded yearly. Presto Research also acknowledged in a recent report that the crypto industry is unprepared for the coming quantum threat. Google also suggested in new research that RSA encryption, a critical security feature used in securing Bitcoin, may be more susceptible to quantum computing attacks than previously anticipated. The Quantum AI researcher Craig Gidney, published a new report indicating that RSA encryption could be broken with 20 times fewer quantum resources than previously estimated. He noted that a quantum computer could theoretically break the 2048-bit RSA encryption with 1 million qubits running for one week. Gidney did not mention digital assets, although the Elliptic Curve Cryptographic algorithm, which secures transactions on BTC with public and private keys, is similar in principle to the RSA. A previous study also suggested that despite Elliptic Curve Cryptography being secure against classical computers, a strong enough quantum computer could effectively crack it in the years to come. Google’s latest next-generation quantum chip, Willow, has also ignited concerns over Bitcoin’s cryptography. The firm said the chip could solve a standard benchmark computation in under five minutes, a task that would take the world’s fastest supercomputers 10 septillions years to solve. Hunter wants the BTC community to focus on preparedness rather than denial A study led by the University of Kent’s School of Computing suggested that BTC might need to undergo a costly and time-consuming update process to counter the threat of quantum computing in the future. CTO and co-founder of self-custody service Casa, Jameson Lopp, also argued that Bitcoin’s community has less than a decade to implement contingency plans. According to a study published by Deloitte, 25% of BTC’s circulating supply is vulnerable to quantum attacks because their associated wallets’ keys have been exposed. The firm also found that the sum totaling 4 million Bitcoin at the time is worth nearly $42 billion, based on current prices. Anduro Senior Protocol Engineer Hunter Beast and Marathon Director of Engineering Michael B. Casey suggested that Bitcoin’s algorithms could be cracked with zero warning. The experts also argued that attackers would get far less in the case of a breach. They believe that if BTC’s algorithms are cracked, it could immediately depress the asset’s price during a liquidation event. Beast and Casey acknowledged that Bitcoin can be secured against quantum threats by moving funds to a wallet that hasn’t had its public key exposed yet. They also noted it could be impossible for actors that have lost their keys or impractical for exchanges that let the public make on-chain deposits. Beast emphasized that the community should lean towards preparedness instead of denial.

The company will issue new shares through a structure similar to an “at-the-market” program, widely used in the US. TOBAM will subscribe to shares at the market price, with each tranche capped at 21% of the previous day’s trading volume. The offering is designed to gradually increase the number of bitcoins held per share on a fully diluted basis, reinforcing Blockchain Group’s Bitcoin-first balance sheet strategy. TOBAM Could Overtake Fulgur Ventures and Adam Back in Shareholding Under the arrangement, TOBAM will consolidate its weekly requests, and Blockchain Group will publish the total number of shares issued and the Bitcoin purchases made from each round.

However, it is not acting as a financial intermediary and will not receive a fee. The fund manager retains the option to hold or sell its subscribed shares. If TOBAM takes up its full allocation and chooses to retain the shares, it could own over 39% of Blockchain Group’s capital. That would make it the company’s largest single shareholder. Currently, Blockchain Group’s investor base includes notable names like cryptographer Adam Back and venture firm Fulgur Ventures. Source: The Blockchain Group Blockchain Group Ramps Up Bitcoin Strategy After $68.6M BTC Buy The announcement follows Blockchain Group’s $68.6m purchase of 624 Bitcoins last week, accelerating its expansion into digital assets. This acquisition brought the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 1,437, now valued at more than $150m. It also marked one of the largest Bitcoin treasury allocations by a publicly traded firm in Europe. The move follows a shareholder resolution passed in February. That resolution approved capital raises targeting strategic investors in areas like Web3 and AI. Now, a second resolution under review could raise the limit from $40.4m to $538.5m. If passed, it would give the board greater flexibility to extend the program. Amid rising inflation and broader economic uncertainty, firms are rethinking traditional treasury models. Against that backdrop, Blockchain Group’s aggressive shift toward Bitcoin reflects growing institutional belief in the asset as a long-term store of value.

These low-priced digital coins have the potential to yield huge returns, catching the attention of investors looking for big gains. This article explores how these affordable tokens could lead to significant wins in the coming bull market. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Approaches the $15M Milestone The XYZVerse ($XYZ) project, which merges the worlds of sports and crypto, has attracted significant investor interest. Unlike typical memecoins, XYZVerse positions itself as a long-term initiative with a clear roadmap and an engaged community. The project was recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project , further solidifying its appeal. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.003333, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.005. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $13 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $15 million . This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse , the community calls the plays . Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price , and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More – Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Luna Classic’s Comeback: Is LUNC Set to Soar? Luna Classic (LUNC) is the original token of the Terra blockchain, a platform that aims to make global payments faster and more stable. Terra uses stablecoins, which are digital coins linked to real-world currencies like the US dollar and the South Korean won. This means people can send money across the world quickly and cheaply, without worrying about big price changes. In May 2022, Terra launched a new version of its blockchain and renamed the original one to Terra Classic. The old token became Luna Classic (LUNC), much like how Ethereum split into Ethereum and Ethereum Classic in 2017. Now, many are wondering if LUNC has a bright future in today’s crypto market. Its technology offers the benefits of regular money combined with the openness of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. With rising interest in stable and reliable digital payments, LUNC could attract users looking for quick and affordable transactions. However, after the collapse of Terra’s stablecoin UST in 2022, some investors are cautious. The success of LUNC may depend on how well it can rebuild trust and show stability compared to other coins. In a market filled with options, LUNC stands out with its unique story and potential for growth. Stellar Lumens: Connecting the World with Fast and Affordable Payments Imagine sending money across the globe as easily as sending a text message. That’s what Stellar and its cryptocurrency, Lumens (XLM), aim to do. Since 2014, Stellar has been making money transfers quick and cheap. It doesn’t favor any one country’s currency and works with all kinds, including digital versions of dollars or even Bitcoin. Instead of trying to replace banks, Stellar seeks to bring them together on a single network, allowing them to work seamlessly with each other. In today’s market, where speed and low fees are more important than ever, Stellar stands out. It has processed billions of transactions and partnered with major companies looking to tap into its technology. Developers can build apps on Stellar, and businesses can use it for payments or currency exchange. While some cryptocurrencies focus on narrow goals, Stellar’s broad approach to improving global finance makes it an attractive option. If you’re watching the trends, XLM’s real-world uses and strong partnerships make it a coin worth paying attention to. Kaspa: A Faster and Smarter Cryptocurrency Revolution Kaspa is a new kind of cryptocurrency that’s aiming to change the way we think about digital money. Unlike traditional systems, Kaspa uses a method called GHOSTDAG, which lets multiple blocks of data exist side by side instead of discarding any. This means transactions can be processed much faster—right now, one every second, with hopes to reach 10 or even 100 per second. Kaspa’s technology allows for quick confirmations, so you don’t have to wait long for your transaction to go through. It also has features like Reachability to explore the network and ways to reduce data storage needs through pruning. In the world of cryptocurrencies, speed and efficiency are more important than ever. Kaspa’s approach sets it apart from others like Bitcoin, which can be slower because of how their blockchains work. With plans to support more advanced applications through layer 2 solutions, Kaspa is positioning itself as a forward-thinking player in the crypto space. As the market evolves, coins that offer fast transactions and scalable technology could gain more attention. While the future is always uncertain, Kaspa’s innovative methods might put it in a good position in the current cycle. JasmyCoin: Taking Back Control of Your Data in a Connected World In today’s world, our devices—phones, cars, computers—are constantly collecting data. JasmyCoin (JASMY), a cryptocurrency from Tokyo-based Jasmy Corporation, aims to change how we handle this personal information. By combining Internet of Things (IoT) technology with blockchain, Jasmy provides a platform where users can securely store and control their data. Instead of big companies owning your information, Jasmy lets you decide who can access it, turning your data into your personal asset. Jasmy’s approach is timely, especially with growing concerns over data privacy. By decentralizing data storage and using systems like IPFS, Jasmy offers a secure and user-friendly environment. In the current market, where cryptocurrencies are seeking real-world applications, JasmyCoin stands out by addressing a pressing need. Compared to other coins that focus on financial transactions, JASMY is carving a niche in data sovereignty. With data becoming the new oil, investing in a platform that empowers users could be a promising opportunity. Conclusion LUNC, XLM, KAS, and JASMY offer potential, but $XYZ’s sports-meme ecosystem aims for 20,000% growth, giving early adopters a unique opportunity in the bull run.

In a recent interview on the YouTube channel The Diary of a CEO, Wood breaks down the main reasons why she believes BTC ( BTC )’s value is bound to skyrocket to at least $1.5 million within the next few years. The ARK Investment CEO mentioned several core pillars which make up the “building blocks” of BTC’s growth in the market. One of the major drivers is institutional investments from corporate holders such as Arkham, Strategy and Metaplanet. “Bitcoin is more of an investment because it does appreciate overtime. Now you go through [it], it’s volatile. No question. And that’s the first thing people have to know about it. But it is becoming less volatile as more and more investors hold it,” she said in the interview. According to Wood, a lot of institutional investors have just started to gravitating towards BTC. Therefore, she believes the crypto space will see a flurry of demand from institutional holders who see the appeal of Bitcoin as a new asset class that offers diversification for business portfolios. Wood remarked that the world has not had a new asset class since the 1600s with the introduction of equities. Since then, the global market’s has been occupied by the same traditional assets including stocks , bonds, commodities and real estate . However now, there is a recent shift towards Bitcoin as a desirable asset. “If this asset does not perform like other assets, in other words, it provides diversification for funds. And because it is behaving differently, institutions have to consider it,” said Wood.

Whereas they have trillions of dollars under management,” said Wood. “And so we think there will be a lot of incremental demand, and to satisfy a lot of that demand. Someone’s going to have to sell,” she continued. Institutional appetite for Bitcoin Wood’s statement indicates a wider trend among institutional investors which are just now discovering the advantages of holding Bitcoin. Back in May, Matrixport analysts found that unlike previous bull markets, the rally that raised BTC to a new all-time high of $111,814 was mostly driven by institutional demand, instead of the retail investors. This means that more institutional investors such as major companies and financial management firms are crowding the market now more than ever before. In fact, at least 61 corporate treasuries currently hold a combined 3.2% of the total BTC supply according to Standard Chartered’s Bitcoin report. Most recently, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet announced its plans to acquire 210,000 BTC by 2027, aiming to own 1% of the total supply of global BTC. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s Strategy remains the largest corporate holder of BTC, possessing 580,955 BTC as of June 9, holding around 2.7% of the total Bitcoin supply. As previously reported by crypto.news, ARK Invest recently upped its Bitcoin price forecast in the firm’s April report to $2.4 million by 2030 if its on-chain financial services grow at a 60% annual rate.

According to data from crypto.news, Internet Computer ( ICP ) rose 8% to an intraday high of $5.66, pushing its market capitalization above $3 billion. The token is now trading 32% above its year-to-date low. Today’s gains, supported by a notable increase in daily trading volume, came as the broader cryptocurrency market slumped , with total market capitalization falling 2.2% to $3.4 trillion over the past 24 hours. ICP’s recent rally was driven by excitement around Caffeine , an AI-powered development platform from the Dfinity Foundation, which recently opened for alpha access. The Dfinity Foundation supports the development of the Internet Computer Protocol. In the live demonstration at the World Computer Summit in Zurich on June 5, founder Dominic Williams revealed that Caffeine will enable users to create blockchain applications in real time on ICP through natural language conversations, removing the need for traditional programming skills. The platform leverages ICP’s secure smart canister architecture and aims to democratize blockchain development, making it accessible to a global user base via smartphones. As of press time, the alpha version is currently open for waitlist registration, with a public beta launch expected within the next month.

Such whale accumulation typically triggers FOMO among retail investors, who follow suit, often leading to further appreciation in the asset’s price due to increased demand.

ICP price, 50-day SMA chart — June 9 | Source: crypto.news It’s also moved above the upper boundary of a descending channel pattern, adding to signs of a bullish reversal. ICP is trading above its 50-day simple moving average, which further supports the bullish case. On top of that, both the MACD and RSI are pointing up, which shows buyers are stepping in and momentum is picking up. ICP MACD and RSI chart — June 9 | Source: crypto.news Based on this setup, the next likely target is around $6.88, which lines up with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. If it breaks above that, bulls may aim for the next major resistance at $8.53, the 38.2% retracement level, about 51% higher than current prices. However, if ICP drops below the key psychological support at $5, it could slide further down to the next major support around $4.20.

According to a June 8 announcement , the program will provide financial support through a combination of original tokens and USDC equivalents, depending on the type of asset lost. Affected users must connect their impacted wallet to the official grant interface, review their specific compensation offer, and sign a confirmation message to accept the terms and conditions. Alex Protocol was exploited on June 6, targeting several liquidity pools on the platform. Alex Protocol confirmed that the attacker exploited a vulnerability in its self-listing verification logic, allowing them to drain approximately 8.4 million STX, 21.85 sBTC, 149,850 aUSD, and 2.8 aBTC, resulting in total losses exceeding $8.3 million. Alex Lab has not yet published a technical post-mortem report, but one community member speculates that the issue may stem from a “Stacks limitation.” I was wrong with my initial assessment of this hack – I didn't understand fully how ALEX contract was meant to work.

Notifications and claim instructions were sent to affected addresses by June 8. The reimbursement structure includes full USDC compensation for STX holdings at a fixed exchange rate of 0.68 USDC per STX.

For aUSD losses, 91% will be returned in aUSD, and 9% will be returned in USDC at parity. Support payments will be distributed to eligible Ethereum addresses by June 17. Users must accept the grants by a deadline that will be communicated via official channels. This is the second major exploit targeting Alex Protocol. Last year, the platform suffered a $4.3 million breach linked to its cross-chain bridge infrastructure. At the time, developers suspected the involvement of the North Korean hacker group Lazarus. ALEX Lab initially offered a 10% bounty for the return of 90% of the assets, but the offer was later withdrawn without explanation.

The plan could change how crypto ETFs are designed and tracked in the U.S., and the crypto community is calling it a “power move” that may drive more institutional interest. However, despite growing excitement around ETFs, the SEC has yet to approve any new applications, leaving some doubts about whether multiple ETF approvals will happen by the end of the year. MEGA BLAST! The SEC just unlocked a new era in crypto. The Nasdaq Crypto Index (NCIUS) now officially includes $XRP , ADA, SOL & XLM — alongside the OGs BTC & ETH This isn’t just an update — it’s a power move toward full-scale institutional adoption. pic.twitter.com/UWeweBCfEX — XRP Governor (@xrpgovernor) June 8, 2025 XRP, SOL, ADA, XLM Join the Index On June 2, Nasdaq submitted a Rule 19b-4 filing to the SEC to expand the benchmark for the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF (NCIQ). The proposed change would replace the current two-asset benchmark, focused only on Bitcoin and Ethereum, with the more inclusive Nasdaq Crypto Index (NCI). The NCI now includes nine major cryptocurrencies , mainly Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Stellar Lumens (XLM), Chainlink (LINK), Litecoin (LTC), and Uniswap (UNI). With this, Nasdaq is aiming to offer a more complete snapshot of the digital asset landscape. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Meme Coin ETFs To Be Launched By 2026, Says Senior Bloomberg Analyst , ETF Still Limited to BTC and ETH, for Now Although the benchmark has expanded, the Hashdex ETF is still legally restricted to holding only BTC and ETH due to current SEC regulations. This creates what’s known as a tracking error; the ETF follows a broader index but doesn’t yet reflect all its assets. To manage this gap, Hashdex uses a sampling strategy to approximate the index’s performance without fully matching it. The SEC has until November 2, 2025, to approve or reject Nasdaq’s proposal. If approved, it could open the door for the ETF to invest directly in all nine NCI assets, offering greater exposure to altcoins and potentially boosting investor confidence in regulated crypto investment vehicles. This move comes amid rising institutional interest in diversified crypto products. Nasdaq’s filing signals a significant step toward broader regulatory acceptance and ETF evolution, one that could bring XRP, SOL, ADA, and XLM closer to mainstream U.S. investment platforms. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Yes, including more altcoins in regulated ETFs could offer institutions diversified, regulated crypto exposure, potentially increasing their interest and shaping future portfolio strategies. What are the long-term benefits of including altcoins like XLM or UNI in a regulated ETF? Long-term benefits include greater market legitimacy, increased liquidity, diversified investment opportunities for traditional investors, and potentially more stable price discovery for these altcoins. Is there a strategic advantage to early ETF exposure before altcoin inclusion is approved? Early exposure to the current BTC/ETH-only ETF might offer a strategic advantage if investors believe the price reflects future altcoin inclusion, potentially capturing upside once the broader index is approved.",News|Crypto ETF,EN,0,0,ADA|MARKET|SOL|XLM|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-09 07:24:47

One name drawing serious buzz in the DeFi market is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new cryptocurrency currently priced at just $0.03, with analysts predicting it could surge to $3 in 2025, delivering potential 100x returns. MUTM’s support comes from more than 11,700 investors who have contributed $10.2 million during the ongoing presale. Investors taking part in the Mutuum Finance Phase 5 presale will see their investment doubled to $0.06 when the token is launched in exchanges.

Mutuum Finance In Phase 5 of its Presale The fifth phase of Mutuum Finance presale has started as the platform attracts increasing investor interest.

The country appears to have insufficient stimulus measures to boost domestic consumption, according to Zhiwei Zhang, President at Pinpoint Asset Management . The result is a fourth consecutive decline amid trump trade wars since the beginning of the year. China’s median estimate, as polled by analysts, showed a 0.2% decline, considering price wars in the automotive industry, which added significantly to the downward pressure. The CPI dramatically dropped in February with a 0.7% decline and continued to fall by 0.1% in March and April. China’s CPI index falls for the fourth time this year In May, wholesale prices fell by 3.3%, marking the highest drop since July 2023 and a steep drop compared to the 3.2% analysts’ estimate from LSEG data. According to Wind information, the core inflation rate that excludes food and energy prices jumped by 0.6% in May, marking the highest since January this year. However, wholesale prices have remained in deflation since October 2022. China May CPI m/m -0.2%, y/y -0.1%. Stats bureau: core CPI m/m +0.1%, y/y +0.6% so not worse than before. True. It's bad headline CPI, but not necessarily worse than last month. （統計侷說得看核心CPI。那你倒是做張核心通脹的圖一起放出來嘛。先謝謝統計局了。） pic.twitter.com/yIWlHd1hMH — Liqian Ren (@liqian_ren) June 9, 2025 Zhiwei Zhang, President at Pinpoint Asset Management, revealed that the price war in the automotive industry has played a major role in keeping consumer prices weak. He added that falling property prices contributed to the downward pressure despite exports holding strong. He argued that the country will eventually depend on domestic consumer demand to fight deflation. Policymakers have urged the automotive industry to end price wars, which are affecting businesses’ profitability and sustainability. The automotive sector ministry wrote on the official WeChat account that there are no winners in price wars, let alone the future. The ministry committed to collaborating with law enforcement agencies to combat unfair competition and vowed to protect consumers. The ministry will take regulatory measures to promote high-quality industry development. Coal mining, oil, and gas extraction firms experienced the biggest drop in prices, with 18.2% and 17.3% drops, respectively. Lijua Dong, NBS Chief Statistician, stressed the need for forceful and targeted stimulus measures to improve consumption. China Securities Journal wrote that the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) may drop the Required Reserve Ratio (RRR) further this year to enhance growth and could end the pause on government bond trading. The Central Bank of China paused bond purchases in January to curb weakening currency and dropping bond yields. Trump tariffs hit China’s consumer prices by a 0.1% drop in May U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which rose to 145%, prompted China’s top financial regulators to unveil policies to boost the country’s economy. China’s Central Bank reduced key interest rates by 10 basis points and lowered the reserve requirement ratio, determining the amount of cash banks must hold by 50 basis points. He Lifeng, the Chinese Vice Premier and lead trade representative, is expected to meet with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in London today for renewed trade talks. Both countries struck a deal on May 12 in Geneva, Switzerland, that led both sides to drop tariffs. According to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the U.S. reduced tariffs on Chinese goods to 51.1%, while China dropped levies on American imports to 32.6%. Trump accused China of violating the Geneva agreement by taking time to approve the export of additional minerals to the U.S.; at the same time, China blamed the U.S. decision to impose new restrictions on Chinese Student visas and further export restrictions. China’s Ministry of Commerce recently said it will proceed to review and approve the export of rare earth metals due to the massive demand from Robotics and the new electric vehicle sectors.

Current SEC restrictions prevent Hashdex’s ETF from holding XRP, though a rule change decision is pending. XRP price faces short-term bearish pressure, with key resistance at $2.30 and downside risk toward $2.14. XRP has joined the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, a move that could further open the door to institutional exposure and reshape liquidity across key markets. On June 6, asset manager Hashdex updated its Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), outlining changes to its benchmark. According to the filing, Nasdaq expanded the index on June 2 to include XRP, alongside Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Stellar Lumens (XLM). Previously, the index was limited to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Hashdex’s NCIQ ETF Tracks This Index Hashdex’s ETF, which trades under the ticker NCIQ, tracks this index, providing market-cap weighted exposure to BTC and ETH within a regulated framework. However, current SEC restrictions prevent the ETF from holding any digital assets beyond BTC and ETH, a limitation that may introduce tracking risk now that XRP and others are included in the benchmark. “Under current regulatory restrictions, the Trust is only permitted to hold bitcoin and ether, and is not permitted to hold the new index constituents,” the filing states. “As such, the risk of potential tracking error is increased.” Separately, Nasdaq submitted a proposed rule change in March that would allow the ETF to track the broader Nasdaq Crypto Index (NCI), which already includes XRP, SOL, ADA, XLM, Chainlink (LINK), Litecoin (LTC), and Uniswap (UNI). XRP was officially added to the NCI on June 3, 2024. Should the SEC approve Nasdaq’s rule change, Hashdex’s ETF would be able to hold all NCI constituents — a potential game-changer for XRP’s institutional footprint. A final SEC decision is expected by November 2. Bears Pressure XRP Despite Nasdaq Index Inclusion XRP is trading near $2.22 after a volatile weekend, with technical signals pointing toward bearish momentum in the short term. On the 2-hour chart, XRP faced strong resistance around $2.30 and failed to sustain upward momentum, retreating to the lower Bollinger Band at $2.14. RSI stands at 51.52, indicating neutral momentum but leaning toward overbought after recent rallies. The MACD remains flat, signaling indecision among traders. On the 30-minute chart, XRP shows a sharper downward trend. RSI is at 34.32, approaching oversold territory, while the MACD remains negative, reinforcing near-term bearish pressure. The price has struggled to stay above the $2.25 support, suggesting sellers remain in control. The 1-minute chart confirms short-term weakness, with RSI falling to 32.74 and MACD in negative territory. Buyers are failing to generate sustained volume, with recent bounces quickly sold off. Despite XRP’s inclusion in the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, institutional flows have yet to lift price action meaningfully. Unless XRP reclaims $2.30 with strong volume, further downside toward $2.14 remains likely. Traders should monitor broader market sentiment and upcoming SEC decisions that could affect institutional access to XRP-based products.

Trump has called for Homeland Security to “liberate Los Angeles from the Migrant riots.” Trump, posting on Truth Social on June 8, coined the situation as an “invasion” and blamed “Illegal Aliens and Criminals” for what he described as violent attacks on federal agents. The president announced that he had directed Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Attorney General Pam Bondi to take “all such action necessary” to end the violence and “liberate Los Angeles from the Migrant Invasion.” “ Order will be restored, the Illegals will be expelled, and Los Angeles will be set free. Thank you for your attention to this matter! ” he wrote. VP Vance shared the president’s message on X, telling Americans that “the president will not tolerate rioting and violence.” 🇺🇸🇺🇸 https://t.co/cvOsEb45MH — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 9, 2025 Elon Musk then quoted Vance’s remarks with two American flag emojis, alongside comments from internet personality Jeffery Mead, who claimed Los Angeles lawmakers have failed to support federal immigration enforcement. “ ICE needs help. Enforce the law, with or without local help ,” he surmised. Protests extend after National Guard deployment What began as a few hundred demonstrators gathering in downtown Los Angeles on Friday, turned into chaos by Sunday. Protesters have lit police vehicles on fire, and riot police with the National Guard were deployed in full gear and clashed with crowds. Late Saturday, Washington sent a new federal directive to ICE mandating them to arrest at least 3,000 undocumented migrants per day. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has accused the Trump administration of instigating the violence. “ What we’re seeing in our city is chaos provoked by the Trump Administration ,” Bass wrote in a citywide newsletter on Sunday addressed to residents under the banner “Dear Angeleno.” She reiterated that the city had not requested federal military assistance. Yet, President Trump deployed 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles over the weekend. It is the first time since 1967 that a president had sent federal troops to a US city without a formal request from the state governor. Governor Newsom condemns Federal Troop involvement Yesterday evening, California Governor Gavin Newsom said President Trump’s decision has “unlawfully deployed” federal troops, and blamed the administration for violating state sovereignty. In a public statement on X, Newsom demanded that federal troops be withdrawn immediately. “ We didn’t have a problem until Trump got involved ,” the governor noted. “ This is a serious breach of state sovereignty, inflaming tensions while pulling resources from where they’re actually needed .” Responding to the governor on Truth Social, Trump lashed out at both Governor Newsom and Mayor Bass, blaming them for the breakdown in public order. “ Governor Gavin Newscum and ‘Mayor’ Bass should apologize to the people of Los Angeles for the absolutely horrible job that they have done, ” he beckoned. pic.twitter.com/1keU3EnfnH — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 9, 2025 The president referred to the demonstrators as “troublemakers and insurrectionists,” and criticized California’s handling of wildfires and permitting delays. He also banned the use of masks during protests, asking: “What do these people have to hide, and why???” “ Great job by the National Guard in Los Angeles after two days of violence, clashes, and unrest. These Radical Left protests… will NOT BE TOLERATED ,” the POTUS said, praising the National Guard. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Announced Monday, the XRP issuer will offer a grant funding of up to $200,000 per project over the next year. The program is a part of the XRPL Japan and Korea Fund and Ripple’s broader 1 billion XRP commitment. “The funding will be awarded to a select group of early-stage startups based in Japan that are building on the XRPL,” Ripple noted. This includes firms working on use cases such as decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenized real-world assets (RWA), among others. The grants will be awarded to startups based on their “growth potential, technological sophistication, and alignment with Ripple’s investment priorities.” Additionally, startups will gain access to Ripple’s global partner network and experts, the digital asset firm added.

Ripple calls the initiative more of a multi-stakeholder platform. It brings together diverse groups to address the gap between traditional financial systems and Web3 innovation. Further, the initiative comprises of four major events across Japan through 2026. These gatherings aim to boost Web3 innovation, policy alignment, and investor engagement through pitch competitions, policy panels, and investor networking. Ripple Initiative Fosters Japan’s XRP Boom Early this year, Japan’s banking sector validated XRP, signalling a turning point for institutional adoption. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) confirmed that by the end of 2025, every bank in the country will adopt XRP for payments. Besides, Ripple head Brad Garlinghouse said last year that the company is in the process of launching a stablecoin in Japan soon, subject to regulatory approval and licensing.

Unilabs’ unique AI-backed DeFi asset management platform sparks presale demand; Dogecoin prepares for a rebound, while Cardano tumbles 10%. Table of Contents Experts see Dogecoin soaring high Cardano tumbled 10% in the past week Unilabs Finance: The first AI-backed DeFi asset manager Closing thoughts Despite the bold Dogecoin forecasts and the soaring Cardano price, Unilabs Finance is in the spotlight. Popular for its novelty, the pioneering AI-backed DeFi asset manager is among the new DeFi protocols to watch out for this year. At the heart of the ecosystem will be the UNIL token, currently in presale and selling out fast. Over $2.2 million has been raised in early funding, priced at $0.062 in the third ICO stage. Hailed as a future top 100 coin, it is a strong contender against DOGE and ADA . Experts see Dogecoin soaring high Despite the recent downturn in the Dogecoin price, 15% in the past week, the 9-HMA and Williams Percent Range (14) suggest a rebound. At $0.18, a retest of $0.20 could push DOGE above its 30-day high of $0.25. Additionally, a new all-time high isn’t out of the question. Down over 70% from the 2021 ATH of $0.73, the current Dogecoin price presents a great entry, positioning it among the leading tokens to buy. While Hcpxbt targets a rally between $0.50 and $0.60 in its next leg up, many top analysts predict a jump above last cycle’s peak. ProTheDoge, popular for their bullish stance, believes the Dogecoin price could climb past $2 this year. Although one of the top tokens to buy in this bull run, experts consider UNIL more attractive due to its AI narrative and higher growth prospects. Cardano tumbled 10% in the past week Like many top altcoins, the Cardano price is in a downtrend. It nosedived by 10% on the 7-day chart, trading at $0.6. However, its long-term outlook remains promising, especially considering growing adoption and institutional interest. At the same time, technical indicators point to a bounce in the Cardano price, the Williams Percent Range and Stochastic RSI Fast are key signals. Its next jump could push the price above the monthly high of $0.8608, positioning it among the top DeFi tokens to buy. Meanwhile, its long-term outlook is even more promising. Despite recent market downswings, Crypto_Twittier is optimistic, predicting a range between $3.80 and $5.60 this year, a bold Cardano price prediction. However, experts believe its upside pales in comparison to Unilabs’ UNIL token, considered a more compelling alternative. You might also like: DOGE to rebound soon; Unilabs emerges as a stronger alternative to ADA Unilabs Finance: The first AI-backed DeFi asset manager Unilabs Finance (UNIL) is a new DeFi protocol that intersects with traditional finance and artificial intelligence. Fundamentally solid, experts believe it could be the year’s breakout project. Also, its native utility coin, UNIL, is considered a strong contender against ADA and DOGE, one of the leading DeFi tokens to buy this cycle. A hot topic within the crypto community is its novelty, which revolves around being the first AI-backed DeFi asset manager in the world. Designed to democratize access to alpha and unlock institutional-grade opportunities for everyday retail investors, it intends to level the playing field for small-scale investors. With its utility coin, UNIL, currently in presale, it has been selling out quickly. A token costs only $0.0062 in the third stage of the ICO, with early investors positioned for significant gain during the presale and post-launch. Other perks to holding include staking, periodic airdrops, exclusive access to high-potential opportunities, voting rights and redistribution of 30% of the total platform-generated fees to holders. Closing thoughts In its early stages, UNIL is one of the leading DeFi tokens to buy due to its upside potential and budget-friendliness. Presenting a lower entry than the current Dogecoin price, investors don’t have to break the bank before positioning for gains. Despite experts’ bold Cardano price prediction, its small market cap leaves plenty of room to run. To learn more about Unilabs Finance, visit the website and Telegram.

Analyst Spots Bullish Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-to-4-22-analyst-spots-bullish-inverse-head-and-shoulders-pattern/,"Crypto analyst CoinsKid has drawn attention to a prominent inverse head and shoulders pattern emerging on the daily XRP/USDT chart. The formation, which consists of a left shoulder, head, and right shoulder, is traditionally interpreted as a bullish reversal signal in technical analysis when it forms after a sustained downtrend. CoinsKid noted that he has been monitoring this macro pattern for some time, citing its recent interaction with key resistance levels. Rejection at the Neckline Aligned with Expectations The neckline resistance, identified on the chart at approximately $2.60, has proven to be a significant obstacle. As per CoinsKid’s commentary, he anticipated the recent rejection at this level, aligning with historical resistance behavior that often follows the completion of the right shoulder in this pattern. The chart, taken from TradingView, clearly marks the left shoulder around March, the head in April near the $1.61 level, and the right shoulder forming in late May. CoinsKid emphasized that the “invalidation of this macro reversal pattern is the head,” underscoring the importance of the $1.61 support zone. A breakdown below this level would negate the pattern and shift the technical outlook bearish. However, as long as XRP continues to hold above this region, the pattern remains valid. Invalidation of this macro reversal pattern is the head. I have been tracking this for a while. That's why I expected a rejection at the neckline resistance. #xrp hold the HEAD!! and take out the neckline and we should see the technical target at $4.22 met. pic.twitter.com/JV5oGA8jcq — CoinsKid (@Coins_Kid) June 6, 2025 Measured Move Points to $4.22 Technical Target He said, “That’s why I expected a rejection at the neckline resistance,” pointing out that the consolidation below this line is consistent with the technical structure’s usual behavior. The analyst concluded his post with a clear target if the pattern confirms: “#xrp hold the HEAD!! and take out the neckline and we should see the technical target at $4.22 met.” The $4.22 price level, drawn vertically from the head to the neckline and then projected upward from the breakout point, represents the measured move of the pattern. This target implies a nearly 94% price increase from the neckline, should XRP successfully break and close above $2.60 on significant volume. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Possible Upside Momentum Toward Late June In response to a question from another user, ElliotHODLs, who asked whether the next significant move could occur toward the end of June, CoinsKid replied , “It’s should be moving up by then yes.” This suggests that he expects bullish momentum to resume within the next few weeks, potentially aligning with broader technical and market confluence. Key Support and Resistance Levels to Watch While CoinsKid’s analysis is rooted in classical charting methods, the successful execution of this pattern would require XRP to maintain the head level and breach the neckline with sustained buying pressure. As of now, XRP is trading at $2.17, approximately 17% below the neckline. The chart indicates that the structure remains intact, but the coming sessions will be critical for confirming the direction. This outlook highlights the significance of the $1.61 support and $2.60 resistance levels. Traders closely watching XRP will likely view this pattern as a key technical signal, provided market conditions remain favorable and volume supports the potential breakout.

To extend this model to institutional clients, it recently obtained a $2 billion credit line from prominent Asian conglomerates.

Through its CeDeFi protocol, Avalon also offers yield-generating savings products. Users can deposit FBTC, a 1:1 Bitcoin-pegged asset, and borrow Tether ( USDT ) at fixed rates, funds that are deployed into high-yield strategies via platforms like Ethena Labs ( ENA ). Avalon operates across 20+ public blockchains and 50+ isolated lending markets, with total value locked exceeding $1.1 billion, as per DefiLlama data . The burn follows several major developments for Avalon Labs. On May 26, YZi Labs, formerly Binance Labs, announced an undisclosed investment in Avalon, boosting the project’s institutional backing. And in February, the firm revealed it was exploring a Bitcoin-backed public debt fund under Securities and Exchange Commission oversight, a step that could bring more traditional investors into the crypto credit market.

Investors are holding back across the board as they wait for a high-level trade meeting between the United States and China taking place in London today. The stall comes at the start of a week packed with economic events and fresh inflation data. According to CNBC , the tension in markets is tied directly to what traders expect—or don’t expect—to come out of this sit-down. By early morning, the 10-year Treasury yield dipped by 1 basis point to 4.50%. The 2-year Treasury yield dropped 3 basis points to 4.01%, and the 30-year yield stayed locked at 4.97%. In the bond market, yields and prices move in opposite directions. A basis point is 0.01%, and even small moves like these matter when markets are this sensitive. Asian markets climbed during overnight trading hours, as investors tracked the upcoming U.S.-China meeting while processing China’s latest trade and inflation figures. In the U.S., equity futures reflected none of that optimism. S&P 500 futures pulled back about 0.1%, Nasdaq 100 futures slid 0.2%, and Dow Jones futures fell 45 points, or 0.1%. Those declines followed two strong weeks for all three indexes. S&P 500 sits near record, but traders remain cautious Last week, all three major indexes ended higher for the second week in a row. The S&P 500 broke above 6,000 for the first time since February 21, now sitting less than 3% away from its all-time closing high. But instead of pushing further, traders are pausing. Chris Verrone, chief market strategist at Strategas, spoke on CNBC’s Closing Bell Friday about the shift. “The message of the market is still one that is largely pretty constructive here,” Chris said , pointing to the S&P 500’s recent three-month high. He added that cyclical stocks continue to perform better than defensive sectors, despite weaker economic data. “I know the data on balance has been softer, but the market’s saying ignore it. Cyclicals making new highs versus defensives says, ‘Hey, the economy’s largely OK here.’” Meanwhile across the pond, futures data from IG suggests London’s FTSE will open 7 points higher at 8,836, Germany’s DAX up 3 points at 24,296, France’s CAC 40 up 5 points at 7,801 and Italy’s FTSE MIB 13 points higher at 40,595. Inflation numbers and apple conference crowd the week Meanwhile, the rest of the week is loaded with major events. On Monday, Apple launches its 2025 Worldwide Developers Conference. Apple’s stock is down more than 18% since the start of the year, and analysts will be watching closely to see if the company brings anything to revive investor interest. Midweek, the consumer price index (CPI) will be released on Wednesday, followed by the producer price index (PPI) on Friday. Both data sets will offer insight into how current tariff levels might be impacting prices across the economy. On top of that, consumer sentiment numbers from the University of Michigan also drop Friday, and they’ll include information on inflation expectations. Gold prices were mostly flat Monday morning. Spot gold nudged up 0.1%, reaching $3,313.54 an ounce as of 0543 GMT, while U.S. gold futures slipped 0.4% to $3,333.80. Market watchers say investors are holding off from major trades until the London meeting gives some direction. On the technical side, gold may test support at $3,296, and if that level breaks, it could fall as low as $3,262, based on analysis from Wang Tao, a Reuters technical analyst. Bitcoin didn’t do much either. It held above $105,000, gaining just 0.1% over the past 24 hours to trade at $105,616 by press time. Like everything else in the market today, it’s just waiting.

That would make Tether the 19th largest company in the world, ahead of giants Costco and Coca-Cola. Ardoino acknowledged that the figure was impressive, but said the estimate was “a bit cautious” given Tether’s growing Bitcoin and gold reserves. Tether’s IPO valuation is driven by the current market cap of Circle, one of its largest competitors in the industry, at $30 billion. According to internal financial models, Circle will reach $410 billion in EBITDA in 2025, which is priced at a 69.3 multiple. Related News: Whale Activity Indicator at Its Peak in On-Chain Data - Here Are the Altcoins They Are Trading Tether, which announced a net profit of $13 billion for 2024, is reported to have earned $7 billion of this profit from Treasury bonds and repo transactions. The remaining $5 billion in profit consists of unrealized gains on Bitcoin and gold assets; these gains are not included in EBITDA calculations. Over the next year, Tether is expected to increase its USDT supply by another $50 billion to $60 billion, and will operate with an average USDT supply of $170 billion. With an average Fed interest rate of 4.2%, this would translate into EBITDA of around $7.4 billion in 2025. Based on Circle’s valuation multiple, this EBITDA figure could give Tether a market cap of $515 billion. *This is not investment advice.

Priced currently at just $0.005, the project’s momentum is being fueled by a compelling blend of advanced AI technology, a clear vision for decentralized data infrastructure, and investor demand for high-upside opportunities. As more retail and institutional investors take notice, several factors have contributed to this early milestone—and possibly signal even more explosive growth ahead. 1. Advanced AI-Powered Infrastructure The core value proposition of Ozak AI lies in its powerful predictive engine. Unlike traditional analytics platforms, Ozak AI integrates advanced machine learning models into customizable Prediction Agents (PAs) that help users analyze real-time financial and blockchain data. These agents adapt and evolve based on market behavior, giving traders and investors a unique edge. The promise of real-time, actionable insights driven by AI is resonating strongly in a data-driven investment world, helping attract both tech-savvy users and speculative capital. Youtube embed: Next 500X AI Altcoin 2. Decentralized Network Model for Trust and Security Another driving force behind Ozak AI’s rising presale success is its robust decentralized architecture. Through the Ozak Stream Network (OSN) and DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) integration, the platform ensures that data is stored and processed securely—without central points of failure. As blockchain communities grow increasingly concerned about centralized control, this decentralized model has been a powerful appeal, especially among DeFi and Web3 advocates. 3. Ultra-Low Entry Price with 300x Potential With a Ozak AI presale entry point of $0.003, Ozak AI presents a rare opportunity to invest in a low-cap token with massive upside potential. Analysts and early adopters are already forecasting a potential surge to $1 or beyond—equivalent to nearly 200x–300x returns. This price-performance speculation, combined with a real product under development, has fueled a fear of missing out (FOMO) among early investors and crypto influencers. 4. Growing Institutional and Whale Interest Large wallet activity, including participation from Ethereum and Solana holders, has added legitimacy to Ozak AI’s early growth. The $1 million raised isn’t just from retail investors—it includes early contributions from known crypto whales and blockchain-focused venture capital entities. Their backing sends a strong signal to the broader market that Ozak AI may be a long-term project rather than a short-term meme play. 5. Momentum from the Broader AI Narrative Artificial Intelligence remains one of the hottest themes in both tech and crypto sectors. Ozak AI is riding this wave by positioning itself not just as another AI coin, but as a serious infrastructure project with decentralized data, secure analytics, and scalable solutions. As interest in AI continues to rise globally, projects that merge blockchain and AI—like Ozak AI—are becoming prime candidates for explosive growth. Ozak AI’s $1 million presale success isn’t accidental—it’s the result of strategic positioning, strong utility, and impeccable timing. As investors hunt for the next 100x or even 300x altcoin, Ozak AI’s fundamentals and momentum make it one of the most promising candidates in 2025. If its roadmap continues to deliver, the $0.003 presale price may one day seem like a historic bargain. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based crypto project that provides a technology platform that specializes in predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized network technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to help crypto enthusiasts and businesses make the correct decisions.

Real Trades. Real Results. In a market that moves by the second, Cortextrade.io offers more than just automation – it delivers an edge. By giving users access to advanced crypto trading bots powered by artificial intelligence, the platform turns volatility into opportunity and data into profit. What Is Cortextrade.io? Cortex Trade is a next-generation algorithmic trading platform built for both crypto newcomers and seasoned traders looking for smarter, more efficient ways to grow their capital. It uses state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning techniques to execute trades automatically, eliminating emotion and guesswork. These bots don’t just follow price trends – they learn, adapt, and evolve. How the AI Bots Work Cortextrade’s core strength lies in its ensemble AI model – a powerful combination of multiple deep learning architectures, including: – TCN (Temporal Convolutional Networks) for sequence modeling – CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) for pattern recognition in price charts – LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for capturing long-term dependencies in time series data – XGBoost for high-performance predictive modeling – K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for clustering assets by volatility – Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for identifying profitable market regimes These models work together to analyze 15-minute candlestick data across 1000+ days, identifying complex market patterns in ETH/USDT and beyond. The ensemble approach resulted in a 983+% ROI in backtesting, a staggering number that highlights the bot’s potential – though not a guaranteed outcome. What Data the AI Uses Cortextrade’s AI doesn’t just rely on charts. It pulls from a broad spectrum of real-time and historical data: – Price action and technical indicators – News sentiment analysis using NLP to monitor global headlines – Blockchain analytics, including smart contract behavior – Wallet tracking, especially for crypto whales and institutional players This multi-layered data pipeline gives the bots a comprehensive view of the market – from macro events to micro wallet movements. Real Performance, Real Markets While backtests show promise, Cortextrade’s bots have also proven themselves in live test environments. Starting with as little as $20 per trade and scaling to $100,000 in capital, the bots were able to generate consistent profits over a 7-day real market test – with disciplined risk management and no over-optimization. Built by Traders, Refined by Data The development of Cortextrade.io is the result of years of research and real trading experience. From early rule-based strategies using RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands to today’s deep learning-driven ensemble system, the journey has been marked by relentless iteration and a refusal to settle. Every improvement, every model tweak, and every performance gain was built on the core belief: smart algorithms, used with patience and discipline, can compound wealth over time. Final Word Cortextrade isn’t hype. It’s a system built on research, powered by AI, and tested in the real world. Whether you’re just entering the world of crypto or looking to supercharge your existing strategy with advanced automation — this is your edge. Start smarter. Trade better. Cortextrade.

Fueled by growing institutional adoption and bold long-term forecasts, the pathway to this price target hinges on a seemingly simple, yet monumental, shift: Wall Street allocating a significant slice of its vast wealth to the number one digital asset. Wall Street is the Game-Changer At the recent Bitcoin 2025 event, Strategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor emphatically stated: “When Wall Street is 10% Bitcoin, Bitcoin will be $1,000,000 a coin.” According to him, this level of allocation would equate to as much as $20 trillion flowing into BTC markets, making a hostile takeover economically impossible as aggressive buying would only empower existing holders. The Bitcoin maxi isn’t alone in his mega-bullish outlook. Blockstream CEO Adam Back believes BTC could achieve the $1 million target way before Wall Street accumulates 10% of the cryptocurrency. He suggested that even a widespread 2% allocation across major asset managers like BlackRock would be enough to push Bitcoin’s price to that level. It is not the first time Saylor has predicted BTC’s price hitting seven figures. In a September 2024 interview with CNBC, he forecasted a long-term price for the king cryptocurrency of $13 million, calling it “perfect money” in contrast to fiat currencies, which he labeled “pseudoscience.” Other prominent voices such as former Binance chief Changpeng Zhao, popularly known as CZ, have echoed similar sentiment. The crypto entrepreneur previously projected BTC could end up anywhere between $500,000 and $2 million in this cycle. Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest is another entity sharing the optimism. In April, the firm revised its base case target for BTC to $1.2 million by 2030, with a bullish estimate of $2.4 million. ARK attributed the potential surge to institutional adoption, especially via spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as well as Bitcoin’s growing role as a decentralized, programmable store of value. In the company’s estimation, all bets would be off if BTC manages to capture at least 6.5% of the projected $200 trillion global investable assets market. This would dwarf gold’s current share at roughly 3.6%, a comparison backed by data that Bitcoin enthusiast and early stage angel investor Fred Krueger recently shared , showing that more Americans now own Bitcoin (49.6 million) than gold (36.7 million), with significantly higher average holdings. Price Performance Meanwhile, BTC’s price action reflects a market digesting its recent surge to a new all-time high of $111,814. At the time of this writing, the asset was trading at $105,466, after oscillating between $105,112 and $106,365 in the last 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, it gained a modest 0.6% to outperform the broader crypto market, which dipped 0.8% in that period. Zooming out some more, BTC’s current price is a 2.1% improvement over the last month, while on a yearly basis, it has soared 52.2%, highlighting a long-term uptrend with brief pullbacks.

Over the past week, HYPE has risen over 5% and has seen a 20% spike in trading volume over hints that Binance listing may be underway. BitMEX Co-founder Arthur Hayes Fuels HYPE HYPE got even more attention when BitME co-founder Arthus Hayes in a recent X post tagged Binance founder CZ, asking when HYPE would be available for spot trading. This comes after Binance’s social media channels hinted at supporting HYPE. Hey @cz_binance does this mean Binance is about to list $HYPE spot soon? https://t.co/e7Qk1RGtJ0 — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) June 9, 2025 BinanceUS listed HYPE perpetual contracts with up to 75x leverage on May 30 but hasn’t announced a spot listing yet, despite strong demand. Binance clarified that futures listings don’t guarantee spot listings. But still, Arthur Hayes’ post and the futures listing have fueled hype around a possible spot debut, with Hayes even predicting HYPE could hit $100 soon. Binance had also recently teased that the spot trading for Hyperliquid is coming soon. Who Will List It First? Kraken, Binance US, and Coinbase are all in line to list it in the U.S. Binance listed HYPE futures just after Coinbase, so the first to list spot could quickly be followed by others. Hyperliquid has gained traction for offering smooth perpetual futures and spot trading, especially after handling huge leveraged trades from crypto trader James Wynn. Its total value locked has doubled in recent months, showing strong growth and user interest. However, despite James Wynn boosting the DEX with huge bets, he criticized its weak referral program compared to other platforms. He also said that his partnership proposal was ignored, but it made sense for a decentralized platform. He urged Binance’s CZ to build a “dark pool” DEX to challenge Hyperliquid. This is to help traders avoid liquidations caused by DEXs being too transparent and open to manipulation. “CZ has the money, network, teams to build something like no other. Look at what he’s done with Binance. I hope this encourages HyperLiquid to level up as they’ll soon be outweighed by better competition,” he said. HYPE Tests Key Levels After a strong rally to $38.16, HYPE is now cooling off and trading around $35.01. It is stuck just below a key resistance at $35.91, based on Fibonacci levels. If HYPE breaks above $35.91, it could regain bullish momentum. The next resistance is near $38, and if that is cleared, a new all-time high could be on the horizon. On the flip side, if it fails to break above $35.91, it could drop further to support levels around $34.32 or $33.42. Further, if the price falls below $30.75, it could mark the end of the current uptrend and could lead to a bigger drop towards $22.92.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-09 08:10:20

Was this genuine tension , or a carefully timed shakeup? The debate is on. Some see it as a market reset, designed to scare off weak hands. Others feel it’s just chaos as usual. But for those paying close attention, moments like this are where new opportunities begin.

Whatever the truth, it sparked a wave of exits , and quietly, a wave of entries. Because while most were watching the drama, some were watching a new name rise.
