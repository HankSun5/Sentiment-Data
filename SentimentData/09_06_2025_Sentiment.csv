The conversation between their aides temporarily paused the attacks that had gone viral across their social platforms. Trump hasn’t posted about Elon on Truth Social since the call, but officials in the White House say it’s not because he’s calm. The president is reportedly furious about how things played out online. “The future of their relationship is totally uncertain,” the same official said , adding that the tension hasn’t gone away, it’s just being held back by handlers. They’ve both pulled back, but not because they want to. It was damage control. Trump reacts to Epstein mention and claims about campaign money Trump was already pissed off, but Elon made it worse when he posted that the president appeared in the “Epstein files.” The post suggested a tie to Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender who’s been linked to several powerful men. Trump’s name has shown up in documents released in Epstein’s court cases, but there’s no charge or claim of any wrongdoing. That didn’t matter to Trump. He was livid that Elon even brought it up. Then came the part that really set him off. Elon claimed that Trump wouldn’t have won in November without him and said he gave more than $250 million in political support. Trump saw it as a personal attack. Elon posted on X, “Such ingratitude,” after taking credit for the election win. That hit a nerve. Trump hates when anyone tries to take credit for his success, especially someone he doesn’t fully trust. While the drama was playing out online, Trump and Republicans in Congress were working to pass a massive domestic spending bill. It’s the cornerstone of his second term. But Elon wasn’t impressed. He called the legislation a “MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK,” trashing it publicly while Trump was pushing hard behind the scenes. The president’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, responded by saying, “As President Trump has said himself, he is moving forward focused on passing the One Big Beautiful Bill.” White House pulled Musk’s NASA pick and meetings turned tense The relationship between the two billionaires started cracking before any of the public posts. Trump didn’t like Elon’s talk about DOGE and his overpromising about cutting government waste. Then came the real blow: the administration pulled the nomination of Jared Isaacman, Elon’s choice to lead NASA. That was one of the last things holding their uneasy alliance together. Behind that move was Sergio Gor, the White House personnel director. Gor and Elon have had issues for a while, and it boiled over after a March Cabinet meeting. At that meeting, Trump made it clear to his agency heads that they were in charge—not Elon, who was also in the room. That public statement didn’t sit well. Afterward, Elon refused to cooperate with Gor. His companies began laying off large numbers of people. Government staff started getting warnings from Musk-controlled entities, and those threats triggered lawsuits. Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers called him out. But Elon didn’t care. He kept pushing his agenda, firing staff and pressing forward. Trump isn’t used to opposition like this. Usually, when he fights, he wins. But Elon isn’t a regular opponent, he’s the richest man alive, and he has a platform that can match Trump’s media firepower. Some political operatives say Trump still has more influence. But no one denies that Elon has something no one else does, which is a megaphone that rivals the president’s.

The suspect, a French-Moroccan national, was reportedly found in possession of multiple bladed weapons and several mobile phones. Details of The Arrest According to a local media report , 24-year-old Badiss Mohamed Amide Bajjou was wanted by French authorities and the subject of a 2023 Interpol red notice. The announcement had been issued for charges related to the arrest, kidnapping, false imprisonment, or arbitrary detention of a hostage. At the request of French authorities, Morocco’s national police and intelligence service apprehended Bajjou in the northern Moroccan city of Tangier. The country’s General Directorate for National Security confirmed the operation in an official statement. “I sincerely thank Morocco for this arrest, which demonstrates the excellent judicial cooperation between our two countries, particularly against organized crime,” said French Minister of Justice Gérald Darmanin in a statement on X. Last week, French authorities also charged 25 people, including six minors, in connection with a series of kidnappings and attempted abductions in the region. In May, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau held an emergency meeting with crypto industry leaders. The ministry later announced plans to improve the safety of individuals involved in the sector. The new measures include giving priority access to police emergency lines, home security evaluations, and safety briefings from French law enforcement. Crypto-Linked Abductions France has recently experienced several kidnappings and failed attempts targeting crypto executives and their families. One of the most recent incidents occurred on May 13 in broad daylight. Attackers allegedly tried to abduct the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, CEO of French crypto platform Paymium. This followed two successful incidents where victims were later released with missing fingers. Also in May, the father of a French crypto millionaire was abducted in Paris while walking his dog. The victim was later held for several days before being freed after a ransom demand of $7.8 million. In January, David Balland, co-founder of crypto wallet provider Ledger, was forcefully taken from his home in central France during the early hours of January 21. The executive was then kept in captivity until a police operation on the night of January 22 led to his release. This case also involved a ransom of around $11.4 million.

So far, one of the best tokens that investors have identified is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi project built around its native token MUTM. The design of the project means that participants in the ecosystem, as well as MUTM token holders, stand to make massive gains in the upcoming cycle. Let us take a deep dive into the ecosystem and how it will support the long-term growth of MUTM tokens. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Ecosystem Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed as a decentralized, non-custodial ecosystem where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders, users can deposit funds into the protocol to earn interest. The interest they earn is based on the pool’s utilization rate and is designed to achieve maximum capital efficiency. As more borrowers join the protocol and take funds, the utilization rate rises. This increase leads to higher rates for both borrowers and lenders. When that happens, it pushes borrowers to pay back loans, while lenders are incentivized to deposit more funds to benefit from the higher yields. The result is a situation where the ecosystem naturally achieves equilibrium on its own. How Mutuum Finance Supports MUTM Tokens The MUTM token will be closely tied to the long-term growth of the ecosystem. As such, Mutuum Finance will take various measures to support its long-term growth. These measures will include purchasing MUTM tokens off the open market. As a result, it will boost buying pressure, helping to improve visibility of the entire ecosystem. When the tokens are bought off the open market, the team’s plan is to initially distribute most of them to the stakers contributing to the safety module. These distributions will incentivize more stakers to deposit their tokens, which will boost the protocol’s liquidity. Once they get past the initial stages, they plan to use the token purchases to support the long-term growth of the ecosystem. The support will include marketing activities, expanding the liquidity pools, and much more. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale And Giveaway Mutuum Finance is currently in the presale, which has been a massive success. So far, it has raised over $10.1 million from investors. There are currently over 11,700 investors who have secured their presale tokens. The presale is in phase 5, where tokens are going for $0.03, which marks a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will increase by 16.67% to $0.035. This stepped increase is a feature meant to ensure that the earliest buyers get the most rewards. On listing day, the tokens will launch at $0.06, which means current buyers stand to make a 100% ROI on their purchase. To further boost the rewards to its community, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has organized a massive $100,000 giveaway. In this giveaway, buyers of the MUTM presale tokens stand a chance to win $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. To be one of the 10 lucky winners that will receive this reward, all you need to do is purchase a minimum of $50 worth of MUTM tokens in the ongoing presale. The team has also organized a mini competition for presale buyers, where the top 50 participants will be eligible to receive bonus spot token drops. The leaderboard is available in the presale dashboard. For those who have a competitive streak, this is an opportunity to do something fun while being rewarded. What Sets Mutuum Finance Apart One of the reasons why the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is doing so well is due to the recent CertiK audit results. The project has been given a Token Scan Score of 80 on CertiK, which has led to a massive boost in trust. As such, even investors who were previously on the sidelines have been convinced, pouring millions of dollars’ worth of capital into the presale. This new stream of capital has seen the speed of the presale rise to new heights, with over 25% of the tokens set aside for the current presale already sold. This is impressive because the token sale launched barely a week ago. At this rate, Mutuum Finance will quickly move on to the next milestone in its roadmap, bringing the vision closer to life. The team revealed that they will launch a beta version of the platform on the day of the token listing. That is expected to cause a massive surge in new buyers, which will push the token price up by over 2000%. If you have been desperately searching for the next big buy opportunity before the next bull cycle, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers the best chance of success. Do not miss out on this exciting opportunity.

However, with the rapid ascent of Ruvi AI and its recent exchange partnerships, some are beginning to wonder if this emerging token could climb the ranks and rival BNB in terms of success. Ruvi AI’s unique focus, combined with growing investor interest, presents an intriguing opportunity for those looking to capitalize on a cutting-edge blockchain project with real-world impact. Binance Coin’s Proven Success BNB has achieved remarkable success as the native token of Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. Its strong utility within the Binance ecosystem, including discounted trading fees and use in Binance Smart Chain projects, has driven its demand and value. Yet, as BNB matures, the opportunity for meteoric growth lessens, leaving the door open for promising newcomers like Ruvi AI to shine. Ruvi AI’s Remarkable Growth Trajectory Ruvi AI has quickly gained traction, amassing an impressive $1.5 million during its presale and selling nearly 135 million tokens at a Phase 2 price of just $0.015 per token . This accessibility makes it an attractive entry point for both new and seasoned investors. Unlike speculative projects, Ruvi AI offers clarity and structured expectations. Its $0.07 valuation post-presale is part of a predefined plan, supporting investor confidence during this crucial stage. Analysts are optimistic, projecting a price of $1 per token post-listing , which would mark extraordinary growth and position Ruvi AI as a rising star in the crypto market. Real-World Applications Set Ruvi AI Apart What truly distinguishes Ruvi AI from its peers, including even BNB, is its integration of blockchain with artificial intelligence to address pressing issues across various industries. Practical, real-world applications solidify Ruvi AI as more than just a token; it’s a tool for transformation. Its potential use cases span: Healthcare : Revolutionizing diagnostics, streamlining patient care, and improving efficiency in medical systems. Logistics : Optimizing supply chains to cut costs and ensure smoother operations. Finance : Harnessing AI for fraud prevention and smarter data analytics to enhance transaction safety and transparency. This practical focus ensures scalability and sustained demand as industries increasingly integrate blockchain and AI technologies into their operations. Expanded Accessibility Through WEEX Exchange Partnership A critical milestone in Ruvi AI’s rise is its new partnership with WEEX Exchange , a move that highlights the project’s increasing credibility. This collaboration broadens Ruvi AI’s accessibility, allowing a global audience, from institutional investors to casual traders, to join its ecosystem. Partnerships like these not only lend legitimacy but also improve liquidity and create a more seamless user experience. For Ruvi AI, such alliances increase its visibility in the competitive crypto space, paving the way for more robust adoption. VIP Investment Tiers Offer Unmatched ROI One of Ruvi AI’s standout features is its VIP investment tier system , designed to reward early adopters with significant bonuses. The structured tiers provide clear growth projections for investors: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900 . Value at $1 per token: $70,000 . VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680 . Value at $1 per token: $224,000 . VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600 . Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000 . These tiers are a testament to Ruvi AI’s focus on delivering exceptional value, making it especially appealing to investors aiming for high returns. Could Ruvi AI Mimic Binance Coin’s Success? While Binance Coin’s dominance has been earned through years of ecosystem-building, Ruvi AI’s recent momentum signals its potential to carve out its own impactful presence. Its real-world utility , transparent growth strategy, and expanding accessibility thanks to partnerships like the one with WEEX, position it as an exciting contender in the crypto space. Ruvi AI offers investors the rare opportunity to get in early on a project with massive growth potential. If its projected trajectory holds true, it may soon join the ranks of crypto heavyweights like Binance Coin, redefining success and marking a new chapter in the world of blockchain innovation.

With the summer approaching, interest is heating up around their potential resurgence. This article delves into whether these renowned meme coins are positioned for a comeback. Curious minds will uncover which tokens might surge and steer the market in the coming months. The journey begins here. Shiba Inu Market Review: Recent Decline and Key Price Levels Insight Shiba Inu experienced notable declines over the recent month and last six months. SHIB dropped by approximately 12.65% over the last month, while registering a significant 53.87% decrease over the past six months. Price movements showed increased volatility with values oscillating between $0.0000108 and $0.0000162. Overall activity has been under downward pressure, reflecting a market that has struggled to sustain upward momentum. Traders have faced challenges due to rapid price shifts, leading to cautious sentiment. Current trading levels show the coin oscillating between a nearest resistance of $0.0000196 and a nearest support at $0.00000885, creating a clear trading range. Technical indicators exhibit bearish sentiment, with the Awesome Oscillator at -0.00000155 and the Momentum Indicator at -0.00000133. The RSI reading of 40.52 highlights selling pressure while hinting at possible oversold conditions. The market appears locked in a balance with limited higher highs or lower lows. Traders may consider placing buy orders near support and setting profit targets near resistance levels, while active risk management is crucial until a clearer market direction emerges. Dogecoin Price Update: Key Levels and Market Trends Dogecoin ’s price declined by roughly 7% over the past month, while it dropped nearly 56% over the last six months. Recent volatility highlights persistent downward pressure on the coin, reflecting a modest loss in the short term against a greater long-term decline. Moving averages and other indicators suggest that the long-term bearish trend remains intact despite some fluctuations in price. Current trading for Dogecoin sits between $0.1512 and $0.2470. The nearest resistance is at $0.3013, with additional resistance at $0.3971. Support is noted at $0.1097 and deeper support at $0.0139. The RSI near 40, combined with negative momentum, indicates bears have the upper hand. There is no clear trend, making trading ideas focused on risk management essential. Buyers may look to enter near support, while sellers could target resistance for potential exits. Conclusion SHIB and DOGE have shown resilience in the past and could see a resurgence this summer. Both coins have strong communities and significant media attention. Their future performance will depend on broader market trends and any upcoming technological developments. If the market turns bullish, SHIB and DOGE might lead the charge among meme coins. While past performance is not always a predictor of future results, these tokens have the potential to bounce back and capture interest once again.

But a new, large-scale survey conducted by the NCAA in partnership with the Harris Poll is providing a clearer picture of the American crypto holder. The study, described by Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, as “the largest ever study of crypto holders in America,” was designed to understand how deeply embedded digital assets are in daily American life. With responses reflecting behavior across all age groups, income levels, and professions, the findings challenge many of the most common preconceptions. Demographics Defy Stereotypes According to Alderoty, the results reveal that crypto “doesn’t have a type.” Ownership is widespread across diverse groups, with over 55 million adults in the U.S. reporting that they own or use cryptocurrency. This represents approximately one-fifth of the U.S. population. Stuart Alderoty on CNBC just made it clear: The biggest crypto study ever done in the U.S. points to one thing. $XRP isn’t just in the game. XRP is the headline. pic.twitter.com/gGqb4eZZvM — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) June 7, 2025 While XRP is popular among institutional investors , it is becoming common among retail holders. More people over 55 own crypto than those under 25, and nearly a third of all crypto holders are women. These findings suggest that digital assets have outgrown their early adopter phase and are now woven into the financial habits of everyday Americans. President Donald Trump recently declared that the U.S. is leading China in the crypto race . Employment data offers another unexpected insight into how Americans are investing in crypto. Alderoty pointed out that nearly as many crypto holders work in construction as in the tech industry. Furthermore, a significant portion of ownership exists outside the high-income brackets. The report notes that 26 percent of crypto-owning households earn less than $75,000 per year, backing the claim that digital assets are not reserved for the wealthy or the financial elite. This data shows that many people desire to build wealth through crypto, such as XRP. A recent Times Tabloid report highlighted XRP as a top contender for long-term investors . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Why This Survey Matters The study’s implications go beyond demographics. With ownership patterns now more clearly documented, the findings may influence how lawmakers and regulators approach crypto policy. Millions of working-class Americans use cryptocurrencies. Trump’s pro-crypto policies and appointees, such as SEC Chair Paul Atkins , could help shape the regulatory landscape to favor these investors.

In a market adjusting to tighter regulations and demand for on-chain utility, its emergence is timely, especially as platforms offering practical solutions become increasingly scarce. Among the top crypto coins to buy now, Qubetics is quickly carving its place as a leader in enterprise blockchain adoption. A wave of institutional recalibration followed the SEC’s May 2025 actions against multiple offshore exchanges, but instead of triggering panic, the shift spotlighted platforms capable of compliance and innovation. In this new environment, Aptos is making waves with major healthcare integrations and expansion into the Middle East, while SEI garners attention for ETF-linked ambitions and a focus on scalable, high-frequency transaction infrastructure. Together, Qubetics, Aptos, and SEI stand as some of the top crypto coins to buy now for users seeking functionality over hype, and long-term momentum over short-term noise. In the wake of uncertain regulations and fragmented ecosystems, these platforms offer alignment, access, and architecture designed to last. Qubetics: Building the Blockchain Backbone for Cross-Border Utility Qubetics has positioned itself as a bridge between enterprise-grade blockchain demand and real-life application. What separates it from many peers is a focus not only on Web3 ideals but on solving existing business problems — and it’s gaining traction with numbers to back it up. With 515 million tokens sold, over 27,500 holders, and $17.7 million raised, Qubetics has entered Stage 37 of its token sale with strong crypto presale momentum. Unlike projects built solely for DeFi or speculation, Qubetics is actively focused on enabling tokenization of real-world assets and cross-border smart contract deployment. Its QubeQode IDE gives developers plug-and-play tools to build dApps, payment routing systems, and decentralized identity frameworks without needing advanced coding backgrounds. Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace Qubetics has launched a tokenization marketplace where businesses can digitize everything from real estate to invoices. This platform is modular, interoperable, and legally structured to appeal to institutions operating across borders. By focusing on non-custodial infrastructure, Qubetics is bringing compliance-driven transparency without compromising decentralization. Cross-Border Transaction Utility Where Qubetics truly shines is in its Cross-Border Transaction Infrastructure. Traditional international payments are slow, expensive, and burdened by intermediaries. Qubetics solves this by enabling smart contract-based cross-border transfers with real-time currency conversion, automated tax rules, and programmable compliance checks. Each transaction routed through Qubetics undergoes a smart verification layer — validating sender/receiver credentials, asset type, and jurisdictional constraints. This allows companies to conduct international payroll, B2B settlements, and invoicing in minutes rather than days, all while meeting local legal standards. Built on a modular architecture, the platform also supports multi-currency interoperability, meaning companies operating in regions like North America, Europe, and Asia can transact natively with local digital currencies — all within one unified protocol. This frictionless capability, paired with its development toolset, positions Qubetics as a top crypto coin to buy now for entities looking to future-proof their financial operations on-chain. Why It’s Among the Top Crypto Coins to Buy Now Qubetics has raised over $17.7 million and distributed 515 million tokens in its 37th presale stage. With only 10M tokens left at $0.3370, this stage offers buyers a fixed 20% ROI at listing ($0.40). The protocol’s bold move to reduce total supply to 1.36B enhances scarcity, appealing to long-term crypto holders. Due to shifting global regulations, Qubetics also stands out for its modular compliance integrations and region-specific smart contract capabilities. As international firms seek secure and efficient blockchain platforms, Qubetics offers a polished alternative to bloated, gas-heavy networks. It’s fast becoming one of the top crypto coins to buy now due to utility-first engineering, growing adoption, and long-term development potential. Aptos Expands Its Middle East Influence with Enterprise Health Initiative Aptos took significant steps in 2025 to shift from a Layer-1 competitor into a global development ecosystem. The most recent move—a joint investment in Universal Health Token—has sparked attention in both blockchain and traditional markets. By merging blockchain with medical records and patient data security, Aptos is expanding beyond finance into real-world industries. Furthermore, Aptos recently opened a strategic office in Abu Dhabi, signaling its long-term intent to become a leader in Web3 infrastructure across the Middle East and North Africa. This move, aligned with rising GCC interest in blockchain and AI, places Aptos in the geopolitical center of next-generation tech investment. The project continues optimizing for developer flexibility with its Move programming language, which has drawn institutional interest due to its security-first architecture. Aptos-based dApps are beginning to find traction in financial, gaming, and data storage verticals, supported by ecosystem grants and partnerships. SEI Blockchain Eyes ETF Listings and Institutional Traction SEI has taken a different path in 2025 — one that leans heavily into high-frequency trading infrastructure and on-chain liquidity optimization. With talks circulating about ETF adoption frameworks involving SEI-based assets, the chain has seen renewed interest from institutional traders and DEX builders. SEI’s architecture is optimized for parallel transaction execution, giving it a technical advantage for order-book-based exchanges and synthetic asset platforms. This performance edge has allowed SEI to grow its total value locked (TVL) beyond $1.8 billion, a 12% increase in Q2 alone. Its speed, composability, and capital efficiency make SEI a compelling option in the top crypto coins to buy now — particularly for those eyeing growth in institutional DeFi and digital asset securitization. Final Verdict: Three Chains, One Common Goal — Scalable Real-World Value In an industry long dominated by hype cycles and technical jargon, a quiet transformation is taking place. Qubetics, Aptos, and SEI aren’t riding trends — they’re building infrastructure. For those scanning the market for top crypto coins to buy now , these three offer more than hope. They offer frameworks for actual, measurable impact. Qubetics stands out for its cross-border business tooling and real-world tokenization framework. Aptos proves its worth through health-tech breakthroughs and geopolitical strategy. SEI shows that speed and scale still matter — especially when paired with ETF opportunity. As the noise fades and utility rises, these three blockchains are becoming the top crypto coins to buy now — not just for short-term speculation but for the long-term value they’re actively engineering. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is Qubetics focused on in 2025?

Why is Qubetics considered one of the top crypto coins to buy now? Its enterprise-grade tools and real-world application make it a standout utility chain.

Per the Japanese newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun , senators approved several revisions to the Payment Services Act on June 6. Japanese Crypto Brokerages: Deregulation on The Way The revised act contains several crypto-related clauses. But arguably the most significant of these pertains to brokerages. The National Diet Building, in Tokyo, Japan. (Source: Kestrel [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Currently, brokerages need to apply to the regulatory Financial Services Agency (FSA) for operating permits. These permits are the same, highly restrictive, stringent licences required by crypto exchanges and wallet operators. The new amendment, however, creates a new legal category in the crypto sector called “intermediary businesses.” The regulatory barriers for this category will be much easier to overcome. And firms falling into this category will not have to adhere to the same level of regulatory compliance. The FSA and the government approved the new measures in March this year, submitting the amendments to the National Diet the same month. The bill passed the lower house without major opposition. Following its approval by the House of Councilors, the bill is now set to promulgate in June 2026. Japan will stick to its stance of seeking a review of all US tariffs in what could be the final ministerial-level talks ahead of a leaders’ summit this month https://t.co/oYmq2lX1Wm — Bloomberg (@business) June 5, 2025 Bill Will Create New Customer Safeguards, MPs Claim Lawmakers said the amendment was a response to the rapid rise of digital finance. They also said the bill would help boost customer protection and promote innovation throughout the country. Japanese media outlets claim that major businesses think the measures will significantly lower the barriers for gaming firms looking to move into the web3 and crypto spaces. The bill also allows the Prime Minister’s office to order individual crypto exchange operators to hold a portion of their assets in Japan. The exact amount may be specified by a Cabinet Order. This clause is a response to the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX in 2022. At the time of its bankruptcy, FTX operated the FTX Japan subsidiary, which was unable to access its overseas funds. This left users unable to withdraw their coins from the FTX Japan platform after the collapse. The new rules will also prevent overseas operators or subsidiaries from sending their funds overseas if they go bankrupt.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. BlackRock calls Quantum computers, with their ability to outperform classical binary computers and break traditional encryption, a threat to crypto . So surely BTC would price this in, as the threat of computers soon being able to break the encryption that enables the scarcity of bitcoin is an existential one. But on a recent CNBC appearance, Strategy's Michael Saylor downplayed quantum's threat to BTC, arguing that the Bitcoin protocol would implement a software upgrade – just like any other tech company – when the threat becomes imminent. ""It's mainly marketing from people that want to sell you the next quantum yo-yo token,"" Saylor said on CNBC. ""Google and Microsoft aren't going to sell you a computer that cracks modern cryptography because it would destroy Google and Microsoft – and the U.S. Government and the banking system."" Already, there are a number of proposals about how to secure Proof of Work against the quantum threat, including from BTQ , a startup building quantum-proof crypto hardware. One Bitcoin developer has put forward a draft Bitcoin Improvement Protocol that proposes a hard fork which would move everyone's wallets to quantum-secure addresses. ""Bitcoin is a protocol; the software gets upgraded every year,"" Saylor concluded, arguing that the bigger security threat for bitcoin is phishing. Saylor's view isn't a universal one, however. A recent report from Presto Research argued that the crypto industry is ""unprepared"" for the coming quantum threat. With BTC above $100K and the market getting ready to challenge another all-time high, traders just don't seem to be concerned. As CRCL has a Blockbuster IPO, the True Market Size of Stablecoins Remains a Mystery. Circle recently had a blockbuster initial public offering, and is set to open the U.S. trading week Monday at over $107 – an impressive rally over its opening price of $69. The number of stablecoins in circulation – the market cap of the asset category – is a well-known fact. Issuance can be seen on-chain after all, and that number comes in at $254 billion, according to CoinGecko data . But figuring out the volume of stablecoins used in payments is a little trickier. In a recent thread on X , Nic Carter, partner at Castle Island Ventures and the cofounder of blockchain data aggregator Coinmetrics, parsed through the available data and found that there's a huge discrepancy in the numbers. Estimating the genuine share of stablecoin transactions driven by payments rather than trading is complicated due to challenges like MEV bot interference, duplicative on-chain transactions, and spam activity designed purely to inflate metrics. Recent analyses illustrate this uncertainty starkly. A top-down heuristic from Visa and Allium estimates stablecoin transaction volumes at roughly $9 trillion annually as of May 2025. However, this figure broadly encompasses trading, DeFi activity, and settlements—not purely payments. In contrast, more detailed bottom-up analyses offer narrower but clearer insights. Fireblocks, a major custody provider, reported annual verified stablecoin payments of around $232 billion, compared with a significantly larger $2.12 trillion in trading volumes among its clients, suggesting that genuine payment transactions represent about 10% of their total stablecoin activity. Similarly, a targeted joint study by Artemis and Dragonfly sampled 20 stablecoin-focused payment providers directly. It calculated a conservative annualized payment volume of approximately $72.3 billion, acknowledging this as a probable undercount given limited sampling. In comparison to that $72.3 billion figure at the high end, Carter writes, is $232 billion, underscoring the substantial uncertainty around how extensively stablecoins are genuinely used as a payment mechanism. As for Circle, the stablecoin issuer doesn't provide a figure in its IPO filing on how much USDC is used for payments, only pointing to general transaction volume. News Roundup Coinbase, BiT Global Settle Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) Delisting Lawsuit BiT Global and Coinbase have settled their legal dispute over Coinbase's delisting of wrapped bitcoin (wBTC), CoinDesk previously reported . According to a joint court filing, BiT Global agreed to dismiss its lawsuit with prejudice—meaning the case cannot be refiled—and each company will cover its own legal costs. BiT Global initially sued Coinbase last year, claiming the delisting unfairly damaged wBTC's liquidity and reputation, while favoring Coinbase’s competing token, cbBTC. Coinbase cited concerns over crypto billionaire Justin Sun’s involvement with wBTC, labeling it an ""unacceptable risk,"" though specific settlement terms beyond the dismissal were not disclosed. Winklevoss Twins' Crypto Exchange Gemini Files Confidentially With SEC for IPO Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange and custody platform founded by billionaires Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has confidentially filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to go public, CoinDesk previously reported . The IPO details, including the size and valuation, remain undisclosed, but Gemini has already engaged Goldman Sachs and Citigroup as financial advisors, positioning itself prominently among crypto-native firms entering traditional markets. This filing follows the successful IPO of stablecoin issuer Circle, whose shares surged dramatically upon debuting on the New York Stock Exchange. Gemini's planned IPO represents a significant step for crypto companies seeking broader acceptance in mainstream finance, although the timing of the offering will depend on the SEC's review and market conditions. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin trades flat at $105,600.30 after recovering from an intraday dip, as miners' recent surge in exchange transfers signals potential volatility ahead. ETH: Ethereum held strong above critical $2,500 support amid volatility, closing bullishly near $2,534, as BlackRock's ETH ETF nears $5 billion on sustained institutional inflows. Gold: Gold trades slightly lower at $3,314.92 but heads for weekly gains, supported by weak U.S. jobs data despite easing U.S.-China tensions.

Meanwhile, Tron is steadily gaining traction with over 10 billion total transactions and daily activity crossing 8.4 million. The token has even surpassed Cardano in market cap, signaling a clear shift in market dynamics. While ETH and TRX continue to strengthen their footing, Unstaked is quietly rising as a contender among the top bullish crypto picks for 2025. With significant presale progress and upcoming AI tools set to launch after exchange listing, Unstaked is positioning itself for a breakout. Unstaked: Eyes on $5 with AI-Driven Utility What makes Unstaked stand out is its real use case, AI technology aligned with blockchain for practical automation. It’s not just talk. The team is building AI agents to support social activities on Telegram, X, and Discord for creators, DAOs, and Web3 users. These AI systems are set to go live only after exchange listings begin. As Unstaked sits in Stage 19, its price is $0.011065, and over 1.1 billion coins have been sold with total presale funds reaching $9.2 million. This growth points to strong user confidence. Rather than selling a vague AI idea, Unstaked is building a working product meant to ease the workload across online communities. With a listing price of $0.1819, early buyers are aiming for a possible 27x gain. But the broader target is $5, something many see as feasible due to its actual use case and growing demand. Among today’s top bullish crypto picks, Unstaked is grabbing attention with strong presale traction and a realistic roadmap. TRX 2025 Outlook: Strong Activity but Questions Remain Tron (TRX) has shown positive signals in 2025, with its price staying above $0.27. It recently surpassed Cardano in market cap, entering the top 9 globally. This jump comes from consistent user activity and stablecoin inflows. The platform has now logged over 10 billion transactions, with more than 8.4 million happening daily. Market sentiment is currently set to “Greed,” while volatility has slowed. Analysts predict TRX could soon hit $0.30, with a possible climb to $0.53 by year-end. With $379 million in daily trading and growing user engagement, TRX is building confidence. Even though it doesn’t always make headlines, its performance stats speak loudly. Ethereum Price Movement: ETF Support and Pectra Rollout Ethereum (ETH) is gaining strength again, hovering near $2,509. Recent ETF inflows and the Pectra upgrade have played key roles. May alone brought $564 million from spot ETFs, indicating strong institutional support. The May 7 Pectra update raised validator limits to 2,048 ETH, boosting efficiency and transaction speed. Network use remains above 50%, and Layer-2 protocols continue to drive activity. ETH holds a $302 billion market cap with $13.8 billion in daily volume. Experts now expect a short-term move to $2,541. With the Fear & Greed Index still showing “Greed,” ETH may keep climbing through Q3 as long as ETF momentum continues. Final Thoughts! Ethereum (ETH) and Tron (TRX) are both delivering noticeable performance in 2025. ETH is gaining on the back of its Pectra upgrade and ETF growth, while TRX maintains strength above $0.27 due to network activity and reduced volatility. Still, Unstaked could be the standout. With its price at $0.011065, 1.1 billion coins sold, and crypto presale funding now at $9.2 million, the numbers are speaking clearly. Its AI tools, set to activate post-listing, aim to serve real user needs daily. For those watching top bullish crypto options, Unstaked offers both momentum and a clear path forward. That $5 target may not be so far off.

The shift from speculation to real-world impact has created a clearer path for those searching for the most popular crypto options that could deliver in 2025 and beyond. While meme tokens and hype cycles may dominate headlines, names like BlockDAG, VeChain, Chainlink, and Ondo are drawing sustained interest due to their consistent development and growing utility. From enterprise adoption and data infrastructure to tokenized finance and mobile-powered mining, these four platforms represent different strategies with shared potential. BlockDAG (BDAG): From Mobile Miners to Market Momentum BlockDAG is emerging as a serious contender among the most popular crypto picks this year. With its June 13 Go Live reveal fast approaching, anticipation is building around upcoming updates expected to outline its exchange rollout, coin utility roadmap, and broader ecosystem plans. What makes BlockDAG particularly compelling is how aligned its development, user adoption, and financial traction have become. The X1 Miner app , which allows users to earn BDAG coins on mobile devices without traditional mining hardware, has already attracted more than 1.5 million users. This level of engagement demonstrates that BlockDAG’s concept of accessible mining is working and scaling. Financially, the numbers are just as impressive. Over $289 million has been raised through the presale, with more than 22 billion BDAG sold. Now in batch 28, the current presale price sits at $0.0018 until June 13, giving buyers a 2,520% return compared to batch 1. With proven demand, working tools, and a well-timed reveal, BlockDAG is transitioning from potential to performance, earning its place among the most popular crypto stories of 2025. VeChain (VET): Real Utility Through Enterprise Supply Chain Innovation VeChain continues to make its mark by focusing on one of the most practical use cases for blockchain: improving supply chain transparency. By helping companies verify products, track logistics, and ensure compliance, VeChain has become a go-to solution in industries ranging from pharmaceuticals to fashion. Its dual-token model, VET for value transfer and VTHO for transaction costs, adds efficiency to its blockchain while making it easier for enterprises to integrate without volatility concerns. Over the past year, VeChain has added new partnerships with global logistics providers and major retailers, reflecting ongoing adoption. For those evaluating the most popular crypto choices from a real-world integration standpoint, VeChain stands out. Its focus on traceability and authenticated data offers a compelling alternative to more speculative projects, especially as more industries digitize their operations and require tamper-proof systems. Chainlink (LINK): A Backbone for DeFi and Web3 Connectivity Chainlink is one of the foundational projects in the DeFi and Web3 space, known for its decentralized oracle network. By supplying smart contracts with off-chain data, including price feeds, market indexes, and weather data, Chainlink plays a critical role in ensuring these systems function accurately. More recently, Chainlink has expanded its scope with the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which enables smart contracts across different blockchains to communicate securely. This development has major implications for multichain applications and could become a central feature of future blockchain architecture. With new collaborations forming between Chainlink and major financial institutions, its position as a bridge between traditional data and blockchain applications continues to grow. As infrastructure plays become more important, Chainlink remains one of the most popular crypto platforms for developers and institutions alike. Ondo (ONDO): Bringing Real-World Financial Assets to the Blockchain Ondo is steadily gaining traction by addressing a growing demand in crypto; access to stable, yield-generating assets. Unlike many DeFi projects that rely on native tokens with variable rewards, Ondo provides blockchain-based exposure to tokenized real-world instruments like U.S. Treasuries and high-yield savings equivalents. This approach is attractive to users who want to benefit from blockchain efficiency without leaving behind the reliability of traditional finance. Ondo’s model focuses on compliance and structured access, making it particularly appealing for more risk-averse investors or those looking to diversify within the ecosystem. As tokenization becomes a leading theme in finance, Ondo is positioning itself as a key player. For anyone tracking the most popular crypto trends focused on bridging institutional and on-chain finance, this project is worth serious attention. Final Thoughts The distinction between hype-driven projects and meaningful crypto platforms is becoming more apparent. BlockDAG is pushing ahead with a working mobile miner and strong $289M crypto presale, VeChain is advancing blockchain’s enterprise use, Chainlink remains essential to Web3 infrastructure, and Ondo is redefining asset access on-chain. Together, these projects represent different angles of crypto’s future: accessibility, utility, connectivity, and integration. As interest shifts toward platforms with clear progress and purpose, these four are emerging among the most popular crypto options to watch in 2025, not just for what they might become, but for what they’re already building today.

According to people who know the matter, this top artificial intelligence startup provides data labeling services. Assuming this prospective dea l closes, it would also be Meta’s largest AI acquisition to date — and one of the largest funding rounds in recent history for a private company. The report said the deal terms were not yet finalized and could still change. Alexandr Wang urges congress to act fast on AI data strategy Just three months after DeepSeek sent waves through the global tech community with an AI model on par with America’s best, 28-year-old AI entrepreneur Alexandr Wang came before Congress with a sobering message: the US needs to move quickly to protect its edge. According to Wang, America needs to establish a “national AI data reserve,” supply enough power for data centers, and avoid an onerous patchwork of state-level rules. He said this at the April hearing, and lawmakers welcomed his feedback. “It’s good to see you again here in Washington,” Republican Representative Neal Dunn of Florida said. “You’re becoming a regular up here.” Wang is the CEO of Scale AI, a company quietly but powerfully shaping the future of artificial intelligence. While not as widely known as OpenAI’s Sam Altman , Wang has become a key figure in tech and policy circles. Scale AI provides foundational data-labeling services for companies like Meta and OpenAI, powering the training of AI models and helping businesses build custom AI applications. Initially known for labeling images for self-driving car models, Scale has since shifted toward curating the massive volumes of text data needed for large language models like ChatGPT. Today, Scale recruits highly educated professionals—PhDs, nurses, and legal experts—to develop sophisticated AI systems. “The three pillars of AI are chips, talent, and data,” said one person familiar with the company’s operations. “Scale dominates the data pillar.” Now, Scale’s influence is poised to grow dramatically with Meta’s multibillion-dollar investment in the company. Scale was last valued at $14 billion in 2024, with Meta already on its cap table. Scale AI adapts to AI’s next frontier with expert workforce Scale’s rise mirrors that of OpenAI in many ways. Both companies were founded roughly a decade ago, betting that the world was on the verge of an AI revolution. Wang and Altman, friends who once shared a home, have become influential figures in the AI conversation on Capitol Hill. Like OpenAI, Scale has drawn interest from major tech firms eager to invest in its future. However, the company’s journey hasn’t been without controversy. Scale has faced criticism for its reliance on low-paid contractors in countries like Kenya and the Philippines, who comb through massive amounts of online content—sometimes disturbing—to help train AI systems. Some workers have reported psychological distress from the nature of the material. In a 2019 interview with Bloomberg, Wang said the company’s contract workers earn “good” pay — “in the 60th to 70th percentile of wages in their geography.” According to company spokesperson Joe Osborne, a recent US Department of Labor investigation into Scale’s labor practices was dropped. As the industry shifts toward synthetic data for training AI, Scale is adapting. While synthetic data may reduce the need for some traditional labeling work, leading AI labs are still struggling to find enough high-quality data for training models capable of solving complex, human-level problems. In response, Scale is increasingly turning to well-compensated experts with advanced degrees to guide its models through a process called reinforcement learning—rewarding correct answers and penalizing incorrect ones. These experts craft challenging, domain-specific problems for AI models to solve, helping refine their capabilities in sensitive fields such as law and medicine. As of early 2025, 12% of these contributors had PhDs—many in fields like molecular biology—while more than 40% held master’s degrees, JDs, or MBAs. Much of Scale’s recent focus has been on helping companies develop AI tools for high-stakes applications like tax law, which varies across jurisdictions and requires nuanced understanding. This pivot is already paying off. Bloomberg reported that scale generated approximately $870 million in revenue in 2024 and is on track to more than double that to $2 billion in 2025. Interest in its expert workforce has surged since DeepSeek’s emergence as companies race to build models capable of human-like reasoning. Scale AI has also cemented its relationship with the US government, securing defense contracts and finding allies among policymakers wary of China’s AI ambitions. Wang, who is hawkish on China, has made deep connections on Capitol Hill. Meanwhile, former Scale executive Michael Kratsios advises President Donald Trump on AI policy. A closer match with Scale could help Meta fend off rivals like Google and OpenAI and deepen its connections to US defense and regulatory circles. For Scale, the transaction would draw a deep-pocketed ally — and a potential full-circle moment for Wang. In the early days of Scale, a venture capitalist once asked Wang when he knew he wanted to start a company. His answer? “I rattled off some silly answer about being inspired by The Social Network ,” he said, referencing the movie about Facebook’s founding. With Meta knocking on his door, that inspiration may finally come full circle.

The project aims at enhancing AI skills among British workers and students. This came after the labor leader revealed plans to host an in-conversation event in London with tech billionaire Huang to inaugurate a deal that sees Nvidia assist in the UK to train more people in AI and push forward research at universities and the company’s AI lab in Bristol, west England. Starmer places technology and artificial intelligence at the center of his government’s plan to drive economic growth. Downing Street reveals eagerness to highlight its growth strategies instead of budget cuts At the beginning of a critical week in which the labor government will set out its usage plans to spend hundreds of billions over the time of the parliament, Starmer wants to highlight an optimistic outlook for technology and development. On the other hand, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves is coming under pressure from opposition parties and some of her own colleagues over anticipated cuts elsewhere. In her spending review, Reeves will focus first on the cherished but struggling National Health Service and the UK’s ability to project military power in the face of Russian aggression and the potential for diminished support from US President Donald Trump’s White House. She will also confirm big capital investment — which is not included within her fiscal rules — but day-to-day spending will be tight, with some departments facing real-terms cuts. Downing Street, eager to highlight its growth strategies instead of budget cuts, announced £86 billion worth $116 billion in funding for British science over the weekend. This funding will support pharmaceuticals, green energy, and military technology. The government noted that major tech companies such as IBM, QinetiQ, Microsoft, BT, and defense manufacturer BAE Systems are backing this initiative. Starmer hosted CEOs and investors—including Eric Schmidt and Demis Hassabis—this past weekend at Chequers, his countryside retreat, as part of its efforts to advance technology in the UK. UK PMs prioritize AI skills to achieve economic growth The UK is a global AI hub, leading Europe in AI startups funded for the first time and total private investment in AI through 2024. Additionally, the industry has been expanding rapidly and has been supported by more than $28 billion in private investment since 2013. Notably, investing in AI brings advantages to everyone in the UK. Keir Starmer’s vision for Britain to become an AI maker, not an AI taker, is set to be realized at London Tech Week. London Tech Week is scheduled to run from June 9th and end on June 13th. To mark the occasion, NVIDIA and some of Britain’s most innovative companies are coming together to host the first UK Sovereign AI Industry Forum. This brings together some of the UK’s most significant and forward-thinking businesses – including inaugural members Babcock, BAE Systems, BT, National Grid, and Standard Chartered – and enhances the security of the nation’s economy by rolling out AI infrastructure on sovereign soil and supercharging the growth of the UK’s AI startup ecosystem. Through its partnership with NVIDIA, the UK is developing sovereign computing infrastructure, investing in world-class leading research and skills, and promoting leadership in AI across all sectors. Peter Kyle, a Member of Parliament of the United Kingdom who has served as Secretary of State for Science, Innovation, and Technology since July 2024, commented on the topic of discussion. According to Kyle, they have ambitious goals for creating the next generation of AI advancements in the UK. Based on his argument, this will help them achieve the economic growth they need for their “Plan for Change” and keep their status as global leaders. Kyle further stated that ensuring they have the right infrastructure to support AI is a key part of this. He was pleased that NVIDIA is establishing the UK Sovereign AI Industry Forum. He added that this forum will unite top British companies to develop and implement these technologies across the UK, helping them to promote growth and create new opportunities.

45700501,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=742363,1749430800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45700501.jpeg,Mutuum Finance (MUTM): The DeFi Platform That Has Excited DOGE Investors,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/mutuum-finance-mutm-the-defi-platform-that-has-excited-doge-investors/,"Over the past two years, Dogecoin (DOGE) has captivated investors, which has led to hype-fueled growth. However, a new project in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space is turning the tide due to its promise of long-term growth. So far, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised over $10.1 million from eager crypto investors and shows no signs of slowing down. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale will not come as a surprise to keen observers of the crypto market. For a while now, investors have been making the switch from hype-driven projects to ones driven by long-term ecosystem growth. Mutuum Finance, which aims to bring innovative solutions to the Defi space, has demonstrated a strong value proposition that is pulling in more investors daily. Its design envisions an ecosystem where the native MUTM token is at the heart of a thriving ecosystem. The team has laid out a clear plan that will support the long-term growth of the MUTM token price while deepening liquidity in the DeFi protocol. DOGE Holders Are Exploring New Avenues For Growth DOGE, which is a well-known meme coin, lured in millions of investors globally with flashy branding and hype. However, many holders who bought into the hype have realized its long-term growth is not feasible. There are no clear plans to establish a thriving ecosystem like that on Mutuum Finance. As such, investors have been forced to sit back and watch as their holdings dwindle in value. This can be clearly seen in the price chart for DOGE, which shows the meme coin is down nearly 20% in the past week alone. Millions of disillusioned DOGE investors have been seriously looking for new avenues for growth, and quite a number have found their way to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). As the message continues to spread and the presale continues to hit new milestones, it is expected to trigger a wave of new buyers. Progress Of The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has been a resounding success so far, raising over $10.1 million from over 11,700 investors. Tokens in Phase 5 of the presale are going for $0.03, which is a massive 200% increase from the Phase 1 price of $0.01. However, the price increase has not stopped new buyers from joining the presale, as many still view it as a massive bargain, based on some of the analysts’ forecasts of 1300% gains. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price is set to rise another 16.67% to $0.035. That will see the expected ROI in the presale dip from the current 100% to 71.43%, based on the expected listing price of $0.06. Besides the massive utility that is expected for this project, the ongoing $100,000 giveaway has been another major catalyst. The project team plans to give ten lucky winners $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. To qualify for this giveaway, all that presale participants need to do is buy at least $50 worth of MUTM tokens. The giveaway, coupled with the expected 100% ROI, means that phase 5 buyers who qualify for the giveaway essentially have an opportunity to win $10k free. Mutuum Finance Protocol The Mutuum Finance protocol is a marvel of DeFi engineering that is expected to usher in a new era for the decentralized finance sector. On the protocol, users can participate as borrowers or lenders. Lenders can deposit funds into the protocol and earn interest. The interest rate they earn is based on the lending pool’s utilization rate. For borrowers, it presents an opportunity to deposit collateral and receive high-quality assets in return. One reason for borrowing is that a user can unlock the value of their assets without having to spend them. That way, when the value goes up, they can repay their loans and get back their assets. The mtToken Feature A unique feature of the protocol is the mtTokens. When a lender deposits funds in a pool, they receive mtTokens, which represent the value of their assets, plus any interest accrued. For instance, if a lender deposits $2,100 worth of BNB, they will receive mtBNB tokens on a 1:1 ratio to their deposit. One benefit of the mtTokens system is that lenders do not have to actively claim their gains. Instead, the protocol automatically adjusts the value of their mtTokens to reflect the interest accrued. This system also gives lenders instant access to the value of their assets. Since mtTokens are based on the ERC20 token standard, they can be traded freely on secondary exchanges. For instance, lenders can deposit their assets on Uniswap to unlock further market opportunities in real time. Mutuum Finance plans to establish mtToken pairs on decentralized exchanges to make this a reality. Sustainable MUTM Token Price Growth Mutuum Finance also plans to boost the price of MUTM tokens after launch through a program of buying and distributing tokens to stakers in the safety module. The program is designed to establish the long-term growth of the tokens, thereby providing a huge boost to the visibility of the protocol. That will cause more users to join, which will increase protocol profits, leading to a self-sustaining cycle of upward growth. From the above, Mutuum Finance is designed to ensure sustainable returns for its users and MUTM token holders. At the current low price of $0.03, you have an opportunity to join an ecosystem that can support long-term growth. This is an opportunity that you may regret missing in 2025.

On social media platform X , Deaton recently sought to explain why he thinks today’s lofty prices carry more opportunity than risks. His approach flies in the face of the notion that one should “buy low.” He makes the case, by contrast, that macro conditions and long-term potential count for more than short-term price tags. Deaton disclosed that 80% of his net worth is in BTC, and his average purchase cost is less than $25,000. Nonetheless, he does not think the current six-figure range is too late. Instead, he says they’re “more asymmetrical,” meaning there’s more upside based on what he deems are more potential gains versus potential losses—despite the more expensive price. He said this in response to Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey’s appeal for people to find some money and purchase BTC today. Deaton also echoed Bailey’s call but cautioned that citizens living paycheck-to-paycheck should not risk their homes or take out loans to spend money to invest in crypto. Regardless, he maintains that Bitcoin is one of the best current stores for value. Deaton’s criticisms are rooted in larger concerns about the global economy. He cited growing national debt levels in the US, the re-imposition of Trump-era tariffs, and endless money printing from central banks as major red signs. In his view, these are gradually undermining confidence in fiat currencies. For Deaton, BTC is the answer. It’s decentralized, with only 21 million coins ever to be produced, and it can’t be manipulated by governments or printed into infinity. “Bitcoin is a hedge against the collapse of fiat,” Deaton said in a podcast interview last month. Institutions and countries are jumping in Another element of Deaton’s argument is the wave of institutional and even state adoption of Bitcoin. Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) is leading the charge. The company has been in the news for its aggressive purchase of BTC. The firm now owns more than 200,000 BTC, the equivalent of tens of billions of dollars, and is adding to its holdings each week. In the last seven days alone,16 companies have been added to an expanding list of businesses incorporating Bitcoin into their corporate treasury. But businesses are not the only ones being buoyed. Governments are also starting to take Bitcoin more seriously. Rep.Tim Burchett introduced a bill in Congress to codify Trump’s executive order into a law that created a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Countries such as Pakistan, Ukraine, and Ireland are also eyeing similar proposals and exploring the possibility of utilizing BTC n their reserves or foreign exchange plans. Critics groan as studies take off But not everyone is as sanguine as Deaton, even as the movement gathers steam. Dr. Peter Schiff, economist, gold supporter, and outspoken critic of Bitcoin, argued on Twitter that Bitcoin’s moonshot is nothing more than hype. He thinks it still has no inherent value and is far too erratic to be a true haven. But Deaton isn’t fazed.

The volatility has pulled focus away from traditional assets and cast fresh doubt on Bitcoin’s (BTC) near-term stability, sparking fears of a wider market crash. According to Coinglass , over $967 million in crypto market liquidations have occurred, confirming that bullish traders were caught off guard. The sheer scale of the chaos underscores the crypto market’s volatile nature and its reaction to macro headlines, particularly those stirred by Donald Trump or Elon Musk. Trump vs Musk: The Feud Behind the Bitcoin (BTC) Plunge Donald Trump and Elon Musk have turned the crypto market into their battlefield, igniting a wave of panic selling across Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins. Their explosive exchange sent Bitcoin (BTC) plummeting, shedding nearly 3% and pushing it to retest the crucial $100,000 threshold once more. This political clash has pulled the entire crypto market into chaos. Data shows long liquidations for Bitcoin (BTC) totaled over $345 million, fueling analyst speculation regarding the potential for a bigger crash. With Donald Trump and Elon Musk commanding so much public attention, the fallout continues to weigh on sentiment and market direction. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Stands Tall as a Utility-Driven Survivor As the crypto market grapples with the Donald Trump–Elon Musk drama, FloppyPepe (FPPE) stands out as a new breed of altcoin.

These utilities help FloppyPepe (FPPE) remain relevant and active while other projects falter. In a stormy crypto market, these real-world applications provide much-needed substance. Culturally, FloppyPepe (FPPE) draws from Matt Furie’s legacy with hand-drawn art and a hippo conservation pledge. The Floppynomics model includes a 1% supply burn, 1% redistribution, and 1% wildlife donation. This balance of culture, tech, and cause-driven action gives it lasting appeal even as Bitcoin (BTC) wavers. The FloppyPepe (FPPE) Presale Surge Is Just Getting Started While the crypto market is rocked by Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s feud, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is making waves in its Stage 2 presale. Priced at just $0.00000035 , the token has already raised over $363,000 following a record-setting Stage 1 that pulled in $2 million. FloppyPepe (FPPE) further gains backing from top influencers like Nass Crypto, who labeled it an AI gem to his 1 million+ subscribers. This endorsement injected even more momentum into the presale, attracting investors frustrated by Bitcoin (BTC) instability.

Strategic Plays in Volatile Times The crypto market is once again proving just how vulnerable it is to political theatrics, especially when names like Donald Trump and Elon Musk are involved. Bitcoin (BTC) has faced significant damage, and the ripple effects are being felt across nearly every digital asset. This turmoil is exposing which projects are built to last and which are not.

Saylor posted “Send more Orange” on X on June 8 — a phrase often followed by the company’s Bitcoin acquisition announcements. If the pattern holds, this could mark Strategy’s ninth consecutive week of BTC purchases. The post follows closely after Strategy added 705 BTC between May 26 and June 1, spending around $75 million at an average of $106,495 per coin. That brings the firm’s total holdings to 580,955 BTC, valued at about $61.4 billion. According to SaylorTracker, the company is currently up nearly 50% on its investment, translating to an unrealized profit of roughly $20.6 billion. $1 Billion Stock Offering Fuels Bitcoin Strategy Saylor’s cryptic post coincides with Strategy’s announcement of a massive $1 billion stock offering, a sharp increase from the previously planned $250 million raise. The firm aims to use the capital to fund further Bitcoin acquisitions and for general corporate expenses. The offering involves 11.76 million shares of a new 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock, priced at $85 per share. After deducting underwriting and other fees, Strategy expects net proceeds of approximately $979 million. Unlike its earlier funding rounds, the new stock provides non-cumulative 10% dividends — a move designed to appeal to yield-seeking institutional investors. This funding structure enables the company to continue its Bitcoin strategy while offering more predictable returns to shareholders. Largest Institutional Bitcoin Holder Data from Bitcoin Treasuries shows that Strategy now holds more Bitcoin than any other publicly known entity — including governments like the United States and China. Its holdings are nearly twelve times larger than the next biggest corporate holder, Bitcoin miner Mara Holdings. As a result, many investors increasingly view Strategy not just as a business, but as a vehicle for Bitcoin exposure. With Saylor continuing to tease new purchases, the company shows no signs of slowing down.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-06-09 01:52:14

The country received foreign investment for 73 finance projects last year, which caused a 32% decline compared to the previous year. In Germany, which was in second place, deals dropped by 16% to 32. Across Europe, deal volumes decreased by 11%, according to EY’s findings. Martina Keane reveals that the UK’s financial services features attract global investors Reports from sources revealed that investors worldwide favored London as the top European city for foreign investment in financial services in the next 12 months. This is ahead of Frankfurt and Paris, even though Germany was the top choice for the future on a national level. Following Donald Trump’s tariff announcements clouding the future, only 32% were willing to invest in the US, according to a poll. This is compared with 39% for the EU and 44% for the UK. Martina Keane, EY’s EMEIA Financial Services Chief Operating Officer and the firm’s EMEIA Deputy Regional Managing Partner, commented on the situation. Keane stated that the UK’s financial services sector is strong and deep. According to her, this feature keeps attracting global investors, especially during tough market conditions. She also mentioned that the competition for available funding is still intense. EY’s analysis highlights Europe’s drastic decline in FDI project Europe experienced a 5% drop in foreign direct investment (FDI) projects year-on-year. In 2024 the continent attracted 5,383 projects, marking the lowest number in nine years. These project numbers were 16% lower than the pre-COVID-19 pandemic and 19% lower than the peak year in 2017, which was 6,653. Additionally, based on data from EY’s analysis, Europe’s overall FDI project total has dropped for the second consecutive year. This also meant that the continent has had falling FDI numbers for four out of the past seven years. In leading economies, more than 50% of Europe’s annual FDI project total has historically been allocated to France, the UK, and Germany. However, project numbers decreased significantly in these countries last year due to low economic growth, high energy costs, and competition from other markets, such as Asia and the US. France struggled with political uncertainty in 2024, rising labor costs, and postponed tax hikes for large businesses, and Germany’s energy prices rose as its manufacturing shrank. Contrastingly, FDI project totals rose elsewhere in Central, Eastern, and Southern Europe, with Spain experiencing a 15% rise, Poland a 13% rise, and Italy a 5% rise each, though with much smaller numbers compared to the top three ranked countries. The government focuses on demonstrating that the UK is open for business Anna Anthony, EY UK & Ireland regional managing partner, highlighted the positivity that the UK still ranks near the top in Europe for investment. However, Anthony stated that the UK was not immune to the decline in FDI volume felt by other large European nations last year. According to the regional managing partner, the UK still has a strong investment story to share. She claimed it has done better than Europe in attracting investments in industries like technology and life sciences, creating the most jobs related to FDI, and drawing funds from a wide range of global sources. The government is actively working to demonstrate that the UK is open for business by strengthening trade relationships with India and the US. They also focus on sectors they believe will see the most growth and investment under their Industrial Strategy. Based on Anthony’s argument, the UK can showcase a stable regulatory and business environment, which could help attract important FDI projects during this global economic uncertainty, leading to increased value, job creation, and prosperity. The global economy has suffered because international trade disruptions have made things difficult. How much this has impacted investor appetite this year is yet to be seen.

These assets often evolve beyond mere financial tokens to become foundational platforms for decentralized services, development tools, and real-world adoption. Identifying such assets early can offer participants strategic positioning before broader market recognition occurs.One of the most talked-about names in 2025 is Qubetics (TICS) —a cross-border transaction-focused platform making significant strides with its presale achievements and infrastructure readiness. Alongside it, industry giants like Ethereum and fast-rising modular Layer-1 contender Sonic have both earned their status as established or emerging blockchain powerhouses. Each serves a distinct role in the ecosystem—and all three are recognized among today’s crypto top gainers for different but equally compelling reasons. Qubetics (TICS): Cross-Border Efficiency with Economic Upside Qubetics is redefining global finance by delivering seamless, low-cost cross-border transactions through a decentralized infrastructure. Its protocol enables businesses, freelancers, and financial platforms to send and receive digital assets across multiple chains without centralized intermediaries or excessive fees. For instance, a Dubai-based ecommerce brand can pay a logistics partner in Asia using stablecoins via Qubetics, automatically routing through the lowest-fee blockchain. Meanwhile, a European freelancer receiving USDT can convert and withdraw in local currency using on-chain liquidity options. This streamlines international settlement, reduces currency conversion delays, and eliminates dependency on traditional banking rails. The Qubetics platform leverages smart contract automation, decentralized liquidity pools, and on-chain identity verification to make cross-border payments more secure and scalable. This feature suite positions Qubetics not only as a blockchain utility project but as a fintech alternative capable of displacing legacy remittance models. These real-life scenarios illustrate how Qubetics bridges the gap between digital and global commerce. Qubetics’ infrastructure is interoperable with top networks including Ethereum, Arbitrum, and BNB Chain, ensuring flexibility for multi-chain execution. These innovations contribute to its rapidly growing reputation as one of the crypto top gainers in utility and market traction. Qubetics Presale Performance and Strategic Tokenomics Qubetics has officially entered Stage 37, the final phase of its public presale. The token is currently priced at $0.3370, with a confirmed listing price of $0.40—providing a potential 20% value uplift at launch. More than 515 million $TICS tokens have been sold, with over $17.7 million raised and 27,500+ holders participating to date. These indicators reflect strong market confidence and community adoption. The protocol recently implemented a tokenomics overhaul, reducing the total supply from 4 billion to 1.36 billion, introducing immediate scarcity. Meanwhile, the public sale allocation was increased to 38.55%, promoting broader access to governance and utility participation. This balance between scarcity and decentralization enhances both token longevity and functional adoption. From a short-term gains perspective, the financial narrative is compelling. A $1,000 allocation at $0.3370 secures 2,967 $TICS tokens, which would be valued at $1,186.95 at launch. If the token reaches $5, that becomes $14,836.90—and a surge to $10 would bring the total value to $29,673.80. These projections are based on fixed, confirmed token structures—placing Qubetics firmly among the best crypto presale of the year. With limited token availability and final presale access closing soon, early participants are locking in what analysts identify as one of the year’s most lucrative and utility-rich blockchain opportunities—making Qubetics a core name among 2025’s crypto top gainers.

Now, a new altcoin is being closely watched for its potential to match—or even exceed—that performance. Lightchain AI , currently in presale at $0.007, has already raised $18.3 million, reflecting massive early interest. Unlike DOGE, which is largely driven by community hype, Lightchain AI is built on real utility, combining artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to power scalable, decentralized applications. As momentum grows, many believe Lightchain AI could deliver the kind of breakout gains once only seen in DOGE’s biggest year. DOGE’s 2021 Pump Sets Benchmark ​In 2021, Dogecoin (DOGE) the word Dogecoin is now used to refer to the cryptocurrency experienced a meteoric rise, famously changing from a meme-based cryptocurrency to an important market player. It started off the year at about $0.004, and by May, it had reached a historic high of $0.75, which was over 18,000% higher. The record-breaking surge was spurred by the hype released by the media and the social media campaign, most notably that of Elon Musk, the famous billionaire, that attracted lots of investors. The 2021 rally not just increased Dogecoin’s market cap but also set a new record for potential in the cryptocurrency market. Commentators point out that this kind of growth could bring Dogecoin up to a new price level, nonetheless, that is just a hypothesis since it is impossible to predict the future of a cryptocurrency with certainty. (Commas or semicolons are needed) Such predictions can be really inaccurate as they are based on the cryptocurrency domain’s unstable behavior. Lightchain AI Tipped to Outperform That Surge Lightchain AI is tipped to outperform that surge as investors shift focus toward utility-driven, AI-integrated blockchain platforms. Unlike many hype-fueled projects, Lightchain AI brings real value through its low-latency architecture and smart tokenomics. It features a seamless workflow where decentralized nodes process and verify AI tasks in real time, enhancing speed and scalability. With validator and contributor nodes powering security and AI execution, and robust dApp development tools, it supports an ecosystem ready for mass adoption. As other altcoins rise on speculation, Lightchain AI stands out by delivering performance, innovation, and utility—key ingredients for sustainable long-term gains. Analysts believe its technology could drive stronger upside momentum than many current top performers. Lightchain AI- Next Big Crypto Breakout? At just $0.007 in its presale, Lightchain AI has already raised over $18 million, signaling massive early interest and a future packed with potential. Combining the power of AI and blockchain, this project is turning heads—and momentum is only growing. Some analysts predict Lightchain AI could even outshine DOGE’s legendary 2021 surge, soaring to new heights within its first year of trading. If they’re right, this could be a game-changer in the crypto world, solidifying its spot as a top-performing altcoin with real utility. Don’t miss the chance to watch—or be part of—this rise to the top! https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-09 03:00:00

Bitcoin BTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, traded flat-to-negative near $105,650, having carved out a doji candle, a sign of indecision, on Sunday, according to data source TradingView. Data from Blockchain.com showed a marked slowdown in network activity, with the seven-day moving average of daily on-chain transactions falling to 315.48K, the lowest in at least a year. Payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP struggled to gather upside traction despite topping a bearish trendline from the mid-May highs. The cryptocurrency changed hands at $2.24 at press time, down over 1% on the day (UTC). Volatility may increase this week as the XRP Ledger's APEX 2025 conference kicks off in Singapore. Meme cryptocurrency DOGE traded nearly 2% lower, closing in on 18 cents, having failed to establish a foothold above the 100-day simple moving average (SMA) over the weekend. Hang Seng tops 24K Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 1.3%, topping the 24,000 mark for the first time since March 24, according to data source TradingView. The move came in response to the optimism about the U.S.-China trade talks this week. ""Optimism is as high as it's been since Trump's election as top trade deputies will meet in London starting on Monday. There are indications that talks will go all week and Trump himself is optimistic,"" ForexLive's Chief Currency Analyst Adam Button said in a blog post. ""The meeting should go very well,"" President Donald Trump said on Truth Social Friday, announcing the new round of trade talks in London. Other Asian indices, such as South Korea's KOSPI and China's Shanghai Composite, also gained ground despite the deepening consumer and factory gate deflation in China. China's deflation worsens China's consumer prices fell 0.1% year-over-year in May, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics released on Monday. The CPI first turned negative in February. Meanwhile, the producer price index, or factory gate prices, fell 3.3% year-over-year in May, registering a sharper decline than the 3.2% drop analysts had expected. Factory gate prices have been in deflation since October 2022. According to Robin Brooks, senior fellow in the Global Economy and Development program at the Brookings Institution, the U.S. tariffs are generating a deflationary shock for major exporters like China. ""China's producer price inflation for consumer goods is down to its lowest level since the 2008 crisis. U.S. tariffs will now push China into full-on deflation. All necessary conditions for deflation are there: weak consumption and a debt overhang. U.S. tariffs are now the catalyst...,"" Brooks said on X. The worsening deflation could prompt China to stimulate domestic demand with further liquidity easing. China’s central bank in May cut the key interest rates by 10 basis points to a historic low while reducing the reserve requirement ratio, releasing liquidity into the market. Last week, the state-run China Securities Journal reported that the People's Bank of China may lower the reserve requirement ratio further later this year to support growth and restart government bond trading. More Chinese stimulus could bode well for financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. Focus on U.S. CPI The U.S. consumer price index for May due Wednesday will be scrutinized by markets for clues that Trump's tariffs are adding to price pressures in the economy. The headline CPI is seen matching April's pace of 0.2% month-on-month growth, equating to an annualized 2.5% rise versus April's 2.3% increase, according to FXStreet. Meawhile, the core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy component, is forecast to have ticked higher to 2.9% in May from 2.8% in April. Economists at Barclays expect the data to show first signs of tariffs-related price increases across wide range of core goods. A hotter-than-expected print could dent Fed rate cuts, potentially injecting downside volatility in financial markets.",Markets|Bitcoin|XRP|DOGE|Markets|News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-09 03:51:03

BlockDAG is taking a different route. Its mobile-first mining approach is gaining real traction, as the X1 app now has over 1.5 million global users. This level of early adoption sets BlockDAG apart from many others, suggesting it may be one of the few projects prioritizing infrastructure before hype. The X1 app stands out by removing entry barriers. Users mine BDAG coins directly on their smartphones with no battery drain or expensive setups. A referral-based structure and daily engagement model have driven strong viral growth. With millions already participating before full platform launch, BlockDAG (BDAG) is showing that product adoption, not just narrative, still matters in crypto. SHIB Price Declines as Utility Concerns Persist While BlockDAG is scaling up, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is showing signs of fatigue. In the past 24 hours, SHIB has dropped by over 6%, continuing a wider correction trend. Data from Crypto Times attributes the slide to recent profit-taking activity, with larger wallets exiting positions after prior price gains. Despite SHIB’s large following and strong brand, its lack of updated functionality is beginning to show. No new features or integrations have been announced recently, raising questions about the project’s future role. As the market shifts toward real-world applications, SHIB’s meme-centered model may face limitations in maintaining relevance. BNB Shows Strength but Faces Slower Growth Outlook Binance Coin (BNB) has managed to hold its ground. At around $669, it remains steady following recent developments, including a court ruling that dismissed several SEC charges tied to Binance. Additionally, a successful hard fork has improved its network performance, helping reinforce user confidence. Even with these gains, BNB’s long-term potential still depends on the broader strength of the Binance ecosystem. With growing competition from other Layer-1 chains and constant regulatory focus, BNB may offer reliability but could deliver less upside compared to projects with newer, rapidly expanding user bases. For many in the market, BNB appears as a stable choice, though not necessarily the most aggressive path to higher returns. What Separates BlockDAG’s X1 App from the Crowd The appeal of BlockDAG’s X1 app lies in how it blends usability with consistent engagement. It’s only 50MB, needs no high-performance device, and gives users a daily mining task through simple tapping. Referral bonuses and engagement rewards help create ongoing involvement and rapid community expansion. This ease of access brings new users into crypto without requiring deep technical knowledge. BlockDAG’s mobile focus helps extend its reach, especially in regions where mobile-first access is the norm. And instead of speculation, users actively earn and interact, deepening their role in the broader ecosystem before launch. The roadmap includes more than just mining. The team plans to introduce low-code tools, expand community features, and integrate Web3 capabilities. With presale numbers nearing $290 million, market participants are clearly backing the strategy. More than just financial commitment, it’s the scale of user participation that positions BlockDAG for a successful public entry. With 1.5 million people already using the X1 app, BlockDAG is preparing to go live with one of the largest pre-launch user bases ever seen in crypto. This kind of adoption has two key implications. First, when BlockDAG enters the public market, it is likely to generate strong trading activity, driven by users who already hold BDAG and are ready to transact. Second, it builds momentum for further integrations and ecosystem features, all supported by a network effect already in motion. A functional community often outweighs the code behind a platform. BlockDAG has built this community before the exchange listing, which is something most projects struggle to do. The X1 app’s rapid growth is not a coincidence. It reflects a strategy centered on user engagement, long before trading begins. Few presale-stage platforms have this kind of operational foundation, and it’s this structure that gives BlockDAG a stronger long-term outlook compared to other projects still focused on pre-launch promises. With the BDAG presale price locked at $0.0018 and funding already over $289 million, BlockDAG is transitioning from a concept to a practical use case for mobile crypto adoption. Key Insights In a market still filled with short-term swings and speculative models, BlockDAG is working on building real infrastructure. Its X1 app now serves over 1.5 million users, demonstrating practical demand for a product well before its token hits exchanges. As SHIB declines and BNB levels out, BlockDAG is continuing to expand. It’s not chasing quick listings but building an environment where access, function, and growth align. From mobile accessibility and technical scalability to early user participation, BlockDAG is covering all the fundamentals. If future value in crypto depends on actual adoption, BlockDAG is clearly well-positioned. While others talk about readiness, BlockDAG may already be there, bringing over 1.5 million people with it.

Meanwhile, Veteran Crypto expert Michael van de Poppe explained why he thinks the altcoins season is about to start soon. Altcoins Have Been Slow for Years Michael says that altcoins have not been doing well since late 2021. He remembers that the last big altcoin season was in 2017, when almost every altcoin was going up fast. In 2021, older altcoins didn’t do as well as newer tokens. In 2024, most of the hype was about memecoins, not the usual altcoins. He also points out that in the past four years, Bitcoin went as high as $65,000, and during that time, around 95% of altcoin gains were already done. But after that, altcoins kept falling, and many people stopped caring about them. Global Factors Holding Back Altcoins Van de Poppe believes this cycle is different. He says that altcoins are underperforming because we’re still in a “Bitcoin season,” and people are afraid to take risks. When #Altseason ? One of the most asked questions, as people are looking to make a large return, willing to bet everything on it. Altseason hasn't come for a long time, the question is: when will this start to appear? I think we're not too far off, and it's all about… pic.twitter.com/8GtMzDD0Zt — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) June 8, 2025 Meanwhile, Central banks are changing their economic policies, and many fear a recession. And the real progress is happening in DeFi and other parts of the crypto world. Gold is even hitting a new all-time high, which might make people feel safer about investing again. Even the Chinese Renminbi is doing better than the Dollar, which often helps Ethereum do better than Bitcoin. Altcoin Season: When Will It Start? Michael shares that people are eagerly waiting for altcoin season, asking, “When will it start?” He says there are two types of people right now, some think the market is still in a bear phase, while others believe the next big rise is just beginning. He feels that now is a good time to pick up altcoins. Many of them are priced low and have strong teams. Michael says this is the chance to buy them quietly, before the rest of the world catches on.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-09 04:05:00

Trading at $2.25 as of press time, XRP ( XRP ) is up 3.8% over the last day. The price is near the upper end of its weekly range between $2.09 and $2.29. With 24-hour volume reaching $2.65 billion, trading volume is up almost 180% from the day before, reflecting growing trader interest. Rising volume alongside price gains often hints at stronger conviction among market participants. Coinglass data also reveals a spike in derivatives activity. XRP’s futures volume has increased 201.98% to $4.82 billion, while open interest has increased 11.48% to $4.09 billion. This can support short-term price movements in either direction since it indicates that more traders are opening positions and placing bets on ongoing volatility. However, not all signals are positive. According to data from XRP scan, on-chain activity is slipping, raising concerns about the sustainability of this rally. By June 8, there were only about 600,000 payments between accounts, down from almost 900,000 at the beginning of the month. Likewise, the number of transactions has decreased from roughly 1.5 million at the start of June to just over 1.1 million in the last few days. XRP transaction count.

These metrics often show user engagement and utility on the XRP Ledger, and their decline may indicate that network demand is waning despite the price increase. From a technical perspective, XRP has been able to maintain its position above a crucial support level close to $2.08. After recently recovering from this area, the price is now pressing against the middle band of the Bollinger Bands near $2.25. A break above this level could open the way toward the upper band at $2.42. XRP price analysis. Credit: crypto.news Although it is trending upward after recovering from oversold levels, the relative strength index is still neutral near 50. If momentum builds, bulls could target a move back to the $2.60–$2.65 resistance area seen in late May. However, if $2.25 is not broken, a retest of $2.08 may occur, and a breakdown there might reveal the $2.05–$2.00 range. Until on-chain metrics reverse course, price gains may remain fragile even as short-term momentum builds.

The platform is designed to offer users fair and transparent access to high-quality tokens. By removing barriers to entry and offering discounted subscriptions to premium assets, it gives equal opportunity to all users, regardless of account status, trading volume, or social influence. The first subscription event under this new model will feature Bitcoin (BTC), marking a high-trust starting point and kicking off its BTC Trading Month. While many launchpads promise community access, most have evolved into tiered, opaque systems where venture capitalists, influencers, and VIPs secure favorable allocations — leaving regular users with scraps. MEXC’s new launchpad model challenges this status quo by removing lotteries, VIP tiers, and preferential pools. Instead, it introduces a fully transparent, contribution-based allocation mechanism that puts retail users and large investors on equal footing. “The spirit of launchpads has been lost in recent years,” said Tracy Jin , COO of MEXC. “We’re bringing it back — by making early-stage investing truly community-first again.” Participation in the MEXC Launchpad is open to everyone . Users can directly subscribe to project offerings using USDT or other designated tokens. Allocations are distributed on a purely proportional basis, with simple tasks, point farming, or influencer-driven campaigns involved. There are two primary models available: full subscription, where tokens are allocated directly based on the invested amount, and oversubscription, where allocations are shared proportionally among participants when demand exceeds supply. Building on this structure, participants will also be able to subscribe to tokens at discounted rates below the expected market price, increasing their potential upside. MEXC Launchpad is not limited to early-stage projects; it will also provide access to premium, well-established tokens with strong fundamentals and market appeal. The first subscription event under this new model will feature Bitcoin (BTC), marking a high-trust starting point. The subscription period will run from June 6 to June 20 and includes exclusive offers tailored to different user segments. New users will be able to purchase BTC at a discount of up to 90%, with individual allocations ranging from 5 to 55 USDT, and a total pool capped at 4 BTC. Existing users will receive a 20% discount, with allocation limits set between 25 and 250 USD1 , and a total cap of 3 BTC. To further encourage participation, a referral rewards program offers 5 USDT for each new user referred, up to a maximum of 100 USDT per participant. MEXC Launchpad will focus on selecting high-quality projects, particularly in trending and high-growth sectors such as Real World Assets, AI, and the TON ecosystem. Each project is evaluated in collaboration with MEXC Ventures, which provides further support and funding to help innovative ideas scale. Most significantly, no venture capital or KOL pools exist within MEXC Launchpad. All allocations happen on-chain, using a transparent algorithm based solely on each user’s actual contribution. This removes the structural favoritism that has plagued traditional launchpads. “We believe innovation should be accessible to everyone,” MEXC’s Jin said. “You shouldn’t have to be a whale, influencer, or VC to get early access to good projects. Our goal is to level the playing field and empower all users to access high-quality projects at favorable terms. With the new Launchpad, we’re making it easier for real users to engage with real innovation, without the usual barriers or preferential treatment.” As the crypto market continues to heat up, MEXC Launchpad offers something rare: a chance for everyday users to participate in the next wave of innovation, without being pushed aside by insiders. About MEXC Founded in 2018, MEXC is committed to being “Your Easiest Way to Crypto.” Serving over 40 million users across 170+ countries, MEXC is known for its broad selection of trending tokens, everyday airdrop opportunities, and low trading fees. Our user-friendly platform is designed to support both new traders and experienced investors, offering secure and efficient access to digital assets. MEXC prioritizes simplicity and innovation, making crypto trading more accessible and rewarding.

The backlash erupted after Pi Network ( PI ) issued new wallet security guidelines, urging users to protect their seed phrases. Rather than easing concerns, the update sparked renewed outrage. Many users, who claim they followed every instruction from the Pi Core Team, say their wallets still show zero balance. Several posts on X highlight blank wallets, prompting allegations of technical failure and even accusations of a scam. One particularly vocal user, Haifeng Chen, summed up the mood in a heated reply to a post by Pi Network, stating; “Give me back that damn Pi. I’ve worked hard for six years. You still haven’t mapped it. What’s the delay?” His frustration was echoed by others who reported repeated delays and a lack of transparency from the team. For some, the issue is made worse by the appearance of multiple wallet addresses under a single account, adding to the confusion and raising doubts about the reliability of the migration system. https://twitter.com/clarkron_2008/status/1931868439725195537?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw You might also like: Will the Pi Network coin price rise or fall in June? Although the Pi Core Team has emphasized ongoing efforts to resolve these issues, their latest communications have done little to reassure the community. Users continue to demand clear explanations, faster resolution timelines, and immediate access to the tokens they believe they’ve rightfully earned. The continuous lack of visibility regarding the migration status has seriously eroded trust, and many users are now anticipating a rumored Phase 2 update that may finally address the KYC delays and wallet balance discrepancies. However, the absence of a precise timeline has left the community in a state of uncertainty. Pi is down 1.5% over the last day, trading at $0.6286 as of press time. From a technical perspective, the outlook remains fragile . On the daily chart, Pi is consolidating below major moving averages, with the 20-day simple moving average acting as resistance at $0.70.

The overall setup shows indecision, even though indicators such as the stochastic RSI point to the possibility of a bounce. The risk of a further decline toward the $0.55 support zone remains if Pi is unable to break above the $0.70 level and maintain buying support.

CEO Brian Armstrong acknowledged the issue in a June 6 post on X, calling account freezes a “major issue” that had persisted “for longer than is acceptable.” He said resolving it has become a priority for the company. “The issue has been reduced by 82% so far, with more improvements coming,” Armstrong said. He also encouraged users still affected to contact Coinbase Support. Coinbase Tries to Rebuild Trust After Long-Standing Account Freeze Issues The improvements come after years of frustration among users, some of whom reported being locked out for extended periods with limited ability to reach support. Many cited abrupt freezes with no clear explanation, while others reported abandoning the platform altogether due to poor service and a lack of recourse. Account freezing has been a major issue at Coinbase for longer than is acceptable. I could list a bunch of the underlying reasons why it got so bad in the first place, but what's more important is that we've made it a priority to fix, and we have been making good progress. Shout… https://t.co/Emrq6KQhpD — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) June 6, 2025 These challenges have contributed to eroding user confidence, compounded recently by a data breach that exposed personal details of over 70,000 customers . Armstrong credited the progress to Dor Levi, a recent hire on the Coinbase product team. Levi, who joined nine weeks ago, said the company had invested heavily in upgrading its machine learning models and internal infrastructure. These changes improved the accuracy of automated systems that flag accounts for potential violations, thereby reducing false positives and unnecessary restrictions. System Fixes Continue but Users Say Customer Service Still Falls Short While the company aims to minimize disruptions, Armstrong and Levi noted that some freezes will continue in cases involving legal obligations, sanctions, or fraud prevention. Still, Levi admitted that Coinbase’s handling of account access “doesn’t meet [his] own bar,” and pledged further refinement. The public response remains mixed. In replies to Armstrong’s post, some users said they remain locked out, with one claiming to have been denied access to their account for over two years. Another said they left the exchange after an eight-month freeze. Others complained about difficulty reaching human support, echoing a long-running complaint about customer service delays. The timing of the update follows scrutiny over Coinbase’s handling of a data breach disclosed in May. According to Reuters, attackers bribed overseas support contractors last December to obtain access to sensitive user information, including government-issued ID and home addresses. Exchange Tries to Reset, But Consistency and Transparency Will Be the Real Test So, can Coinbase win back trader trust? The 82% reduction is a meaningful start. However, trust in crypto is hard-won and easily lost. For many retail users who left after prolonged freezes, one announcement is not enough. They need consistent action to believe the change is real. What matters now is whether Coinbase follows through with consistent improvements, transparent communication, and a more responsive support system. As the largest custodian of spot Bitcoin ETFs and a major US exchange with over 100m users, Coinbase has much at stake. The company’s efforts to resolve user pain points are being closely watched, both by retail traders and also by regulators and institutions evaluating the security and reliability of crypto infrastructure.

An engine symbiotic to the users’ discovery journey from intent straight to the outcome. TrueNorth’s agentic technology continuously scans across chains, socials, and macro and project data to surface timely, high-signal insights for every user personalized to their portfolio, trading style, and past behavior. “We see true AI agents becoming the foundation for how people invest in crypto for the future,” said Willy Chuang and Alex Lee, co-founders of TrueNorth. “The market is only getting more complex, and our goal is to cut through the noise with a hyper-personalized engine powered by a generative user interface (known as Gen UI) that adapts to each user's style and behavior in real-time. We're building a system where the agnetic flow and expert distilled reinforcement learning models work quietly in the background, driving the user’s intent infinitely closer to the outcome.

""Having led crypto exchanges and worked closely with a broad range of traders and investors, I’ve seen how fragmented data and constant noise creates friction in decision-making,” said Chuang. “TrueNorth is built to simplify this, delivering personalized insights that evolve with each user so they can move faster with more confidence.” For his part, Alex Lee, a PhD in AI, highlighted the platform’s AI-driven approach and ongoing development phase. “AI has reached a point where it can do more than just process data; it can understand context, adapt to users, and continuously improve decision-making,” said Lee. “That’s the foundation we’re building on: agentic intelligence that works behind the scenes to surface what matters most. We’re currently in closed beta, working closely with early users to refine a system that feels intuitive but is powered by serious intelligence.” TrueNorth’s backers, Bryan Pellegrino of LayerZero, Jeff Feng of SEI, Jordi Alexander of Selini Capital, and Yongjin of Presto Labs, as well as Will Wang of Generative Ventures, share a strong belief in AI’s transformative power in crypto trading. Their interests span key themes such as interoperability, data-driven AI models, algorithmic market strategies, and innovative infrastructure development. Together, these interests reflect not only a shared belief in AI’s potential but also the same principles driving TrueNorth’s mission to simplify and personalize decision-making in decentralized markets. TrueNorth, a platform under Singapore-registered Advent AI, is working closely with its first 500 early users, the Truthsayers, to refine agentic workflows for AI-native investing in closed beta.

Teaming up with Web3 Salon, a project supported by JETRO (Japan External Trade Organization) and powered by Asia Web3 Alliance Japan—Ripple, is launching a structured program to support emerging Web3 startups focused on building real-world solutions on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Fueling Startups with Strategic Grants At the core of the partnership is Ripple’s grant program, which offers up to $200,000 per project to Japanese startups working on XRPL use cases, such as DeFi, tokenized real-world assets, and digital payments. The funding comes through Ripple’s Japan & Korea Fund, a branch of its broader $1 billion XRP ecosystem commitment launched in 2022. Selected projects will also receive access to Ripple’s global network of investors, advisors, and technical mentors, providing more than just capital, but also deep ecosystem integration and long-term business guidance. Web3 Salon to Lead Mentorship and Market Readiness While Ripple handles funding and builds connections with new startups, Web3 Salon will focus on founder development. Meanwhile, Web3 Salon will take care of startup founders to grow and succeed. That means giving them mentorship, connecting them to investors, helping them follow Japan’s strict rules, and guiding them on how to launch and grow their business. With Japan’s strong but complex regulatory environment, the partnership aims to make it easier for startups to thrive in the country’s tech-driven economy. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP News Today: Ripple Transfers $498M to Unknown Wallet , Major Events Planned Through March 2026 WrathofKahneman , a well-known XRPL community member, confirmed this partnership ties directly into Ripple’s broader Asian expansion strategy.

The crypto exchange announced the launch of wrapped XRP and Dogecoin on its Layer-2 Base network, giving holders access to decentralized finance (DeFi) opportunities. At the same time, CEO Brian Armstrong reported an 82% reduction in unnecessary account freezes, addressing a long-standing user concern through improved machine learning infrastructure. Coinbase Slashes Account Freezes by 82% Amid Growing User Pressure and Data Breach Fallout Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says the company has made major strides in solving one of its most persistent and controversial issues: unnecessary user account freezes. In a June 6 post on X, Armstrong revealed that the crypto exchange has successfully reduced such incidents by 82%, attributing the improvement to recent internal changes and new investments in technology. “For longer than is acceptable, account restrictions have been a major pain point for Coinbase users,” Armstrong admitted. “We’ve now made it a top priority to fix it.” He added that the company is continuing to roll out improvements and encouraged users with frozen accounts to contact Coinbase Support directly. For years, Coinbase users have complained about sudden and prolonged account freezes—often without clear explanations. Many said they were locked out of their funds for months, and in some cases, even years. These restrictions led to widespread user dissatisfaction, with some customers abandoning the platform altogether. One X user, responding to Armstrong’s post, claimed they had been locked out for over two years, while another described enduring an eight-month freeze before giving up on Coinbase entirely. A common theme in these accounts is frustration with Coinbase’s customer service infrastructure. “It is extremely hard to speak to a live customer service person,” one user wrote. “It can take forever to track someone down.” This customer service bottleneck has been compounded by another major blow to user trust: a recent data breach that compromised the personal details of over 70,000 Coinbase accounts. Illicit actors reportedly bribed overseas customer support agents to gain access to sensitive information such as government-issued IDs and home addresses. The breach occurred in December 2024 but was only disclosed in mid-May 2025. Machine Learning and Internal Reforms Coinbase credits much of the improvement in account freeze issues to new machine learning models and infrastructure upgrades spearheaded by Dor Levi, a product team member who joined the company just nine weeks ago. In a separate X post, Levi explained that Coinbase had made “significant investments” to enhance the precision and recall of its fraud detection and compliance models. These efforts have directly resulted in fewer account restrictions and false positives. Despite these advancements, both Armstrong and Levi emphasized that Coinbase will continue to impose account restrictions when legally required—such as in response to court orders or government sanctions—to remain in compliance with international laws. Coinbase is also under intense scrutiny following revelations about a major data leak that exposed customer identities. According to reports, bad actors bribed international contractors to access Coinbase’s support systems, allowing them to download ID photos and sensitive contact information. The fallout from this breach has been severe. One user claimed that a family friend lost both Bitcoin and Ether in a scam they believe was connected to the incident. Armstrong previously addressed the breach in a May 15 X post, promising that Coinbase would be “significantly strengthening” its internal controls and agent access protocols. The Stakes Are High With over 100 million registered users, Coinbase remains one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world. It is also the primary custodian for spot Bitcoin ETFs, making its operational integrity a crucial matter not just for individual users but also for institutional investors. The company’s move to fix account freezes could go a long way toward restoring user trust, but only if followed through with consistent action. For now, the 82% reduction is a promising sign, but the platform’s critics are likely to remain skeptical until the remaining 18% of issues are also addressed and security practices are fully overhauled. Coinbase Brings XRP and Dogecoin to DeFi on Base With New Wrapped Tokens In related news, Coinbase , has also taken a major step toward expanding the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem on its Layer-2 blockchain, Base. The company announced last week that wrapped versions of XRP and Dogecoin—cbXRP and cbDOGE—are now live on the Base network, opening the door for millions of token holders to generate yield through DeFi strategies. This development allows holders of the original XRP and DOGE assets to earn returns from decentralized applications (dApps) without having to leave the Coinbase ecosystem. It’s a powerful blend of accessibility, interoperability, and scalability—three key pillars Coinbase has touted as central to Base’s vision since its launch. A New Frontier for XRP and Dogecoin Wrapped tokens are tokenized representations of cryptocurrencies that exist on networks where they are not natively supported. In this case, cbXRP and cbDOGE are ERC-20 compliant tokens on Base, backed 1:1 by their underlying assets, which Coinbase holds in secure custody. This ensures the wrapped tokens are fully collateralized and redeemable. XRP, best known as the payments token powering Ripple’s cross-border settlement rails, and Dogecoin, the meme-born cryptocurrency that has developed a robust following and ecosystem, both historically lacked deep integration with Ethereum-compatible DeFi ecosystems. Base’s introduction of wrapped versions now changes that. Coinbase said the move allows holders to participate in yield farming, liquidity provision, lending, and other DeFi protocols natively available on Base. Importantly, it means users can retain exposure to XRP and DOGE while layering on additional sources of yield. Within just 24 hours of their launch, cbXRP and cbDOGE saw strong market interest. Data from blockchain explorer BaseScan shows that cbXRP surpassed a $5 million market cap, while cbDOGE is approaching the $2 million mark. These rapid inflows suggest significant demand from token holders eager to unlock new use cases beyond simple holding or trading. The adoption of wrapped tokens for DeFi use is not new—Coinbase previously launched wrapped Bitcoin (cbETH and later cbBTC) on Base in September 2024, which has now grown into a major asset on the chain with a market cap of over $4.7 billion. With the success of cbBTC as a precedent, cbXRP and cbDOGE are expected to follow a similar growth trajectory, especially as Base becomes a more attractive hub for DeFi applications and developer activity. Why Base? Launched by Coinbase in early 2023, Base is a Layer-2 network built on the OP Stack, developed by Optimism. The network was created to offer a scalable, low-cost, and developer-friendly alternative to Ethereum’s mainnet while staying compatible with the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Base has been instrumental in Coinbase’s strategy to bridge centralized finance (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). By bringing wrapped assets onto Base, Coinbase is ensuring that even holders of non-EVM-native assets like XRP and DOGE can participate in Web3 without the traditional pain points of complex bridging or high fees. In doing so, Coinbase is also strengthening Base’s positioning against other Layer-2 contenders such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync. For XRP and Dogecoin communities, the move represents a major step forward in utility expansion. While XRP has long been used in traditional financial infrastructure through RippleNet and its ODL (On-Demand Liquidity) product, its availability in DeFi has been limited. Dogecoin, often dismissed as a meme coin, has steadily carved out a real presence in the market, backed by a passionate user base and integration into tipping systems and merchant payments. Its new wrapped version could reinvigorate interest from developers and DeFi projects looking to capture Dogecoin’s broad user appeal. Both tokens now stand to benefit from liquidity pools, lending markets, staking derivatives, and DEX listings that can dramatically increase their functionality and relevance in the current DeFi landscape. The Bigger Picture Coinbase’s continued expansion into wrapped assets and Base integration is part of a broader strategic pivot toward Web3 infrastructure and passive income services. As traditional trading revenues face pressure from competition and regulation, DeFi and on-chain products represent a growth avenue for the exchange. By offering a seamless pathway for retail and institutional users to explore DeFi with familiar assets like XRP, DOGE, and BTC, Coinbase is reducing the technical and psychological friction that has long slowed DeFi’s adoption.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-09 05:00:00

The founders of LayerZero, SEI, Selini Capital, Virtuals, Plume, and Presto Labs have collectively backed an AI platform that uses autonomous agents and real-time data to uncover crypto opportunities. AI-focused firm TrueNorth, co-founded by former WOO COO Willy Chuang and ex-Temasek AI tech investor Alex Lee, has raised $1 million in funding to develop Crypto’s first AI-powered engine. An engine symbiotic to the users’ discovery journey from intent straight to the outcome. TrueNorth’s agentic technology continuously scans across chains, socials, and macro and project data to surface timely, high-signal insights for every user personalized to their portfolio, trading style, and past behavior. “We see true AI agents becoming the foundation for how people invest in crypto for the future,” said Willy Chuang and Alex Lee, co-founders of TrueNorth. “The market is only getting more complex, and our goal is to cut through the noise with a hyper-personalized engine powered by a generative user interface (known as Gen UI) that adapts to each user’s style and behavior in real-time. We’re building a system where the agnetic flow and expert distilled reinforcement learning models work quietly in the background, driving the user’s intent infinitely closer to the outcome. Willy Chuang, who previously led operations at the CeFi/DeFi exchange WOO, emphasized the real-world need for tools that reduce cognitive overload in fast-moving markets. “Having led crypto exchanges and worked closely with a broad range of traders and investors, I’ve seen how fragmented data and constant noise creates friction in decision-making,” said Chuang. “TrueNorth is built to simplify this, delivering personalized insights that evolve with each user so they can move faster with more confidence.” For his part, Alex Lee, a PhD in AI, highlighted the platform’s AI-driven approach and ongoing development phase. “AI has reached a point where it can do more than just process data; it can understand context, adapt to users, and continuously improve decision-making,” said Lee. “That’s the foundation we’re building on: agentic intelligence that works behind the scenes to surface what matters most. We’re currently in closed beta, working closely with early users to refine a system that feels intuitive but is powered by serious intelligence.” TrueNorth’s backers, Bryan Pellegrino of LayerZero, Jeff Feng of SEI, Jordi Alexander of Selini Capital, and Yongjin of Presto Labs, as well as Will Wang of Generative Ventures, share a strong belief in AI’s transformative power in crypto trading. Their interests span key themes such as interoperability, data-driven AI models, algorithmic market strategies, and innovative infrastructure development. Together, these interests reflect not only a shared belief in AI’s potential but also the same principles driving TrueNorth’s mission to simplify and personalize decision-making in decentralized markets. TrueNorth, a platform under Singapore-registered Advent AI, is working closely with its first 500 early users, the Truthsayers, to refine agentic workflows for AI-native investing in closed beta. In the coming weeks, the team will unveil key details of its advanced architecture and agentic frameworks as it gears up for a public launch aimed at delivering smarter, hyper-personalized crypto discovery tools to a wider audience.

The founders of LayerZero, SEI, Selini Capital, Virtuals, Plume, and Presto Labs have collectively backed an AI platform that uses autonomous agents and real-time data to uncover crypto opportunities. AI-focused firm TrueNorth, co-founded by former WOO COO Willy Chuang and ex-Temasek AI tech investor Alex Lee, has raised $1 million in funding to develop Crypto’s first AI-powered engine. An engine symbiotic to the users’ discovery journey from intent straight to the outcome. TrueNorth’s agentic technology continuously scans across chains, socials, and macro and project data to surface timely, high-signal insights for every user personalized to their portfolio, trading style, and past behavior. “We see true AI agents becoming the foundation for how people invest in crypto for the future,” said Willy Chuang and Alex Lee, co-founders of TrueNorth. “The market is only getting more complex, and our goal is to cut through the noise with a hyper-personalized engine powered by a generative user interface (known as Gen UI) that adapts to each user's style and behavior in real-time. We're building a system where the agnetic flow and expert distilled reinforcement learning models work quietly in the background, driving the user’s intent infinitely closer to the outcome. Willy Chuang, who previously led operations at the CeFi/DeFi exchange WOO, emphasized the real-world need for tools that reduce cognitive overload in fast-moving markets. ""Having led crypto exchanges and worked closely with a broad range of traders and investors, I’ve seen how fragmented data and constant noise creates friction in decision-making,” said Chuang. “TrueNorth is built to simplify this, delivering personalized insights that evolve with each user so they can move faster with more confidence.” For his part, Alex Lee, a PhD in AI, highlighted the platform’s AI-driven approach and ongoing development phase. “AI has reached a point where it can do more than just process data; it can understand context, adapt to users, and continuously improve decision-making,” said Lee. “That’s the foundation we’re building on: agentic intelligence that works behind the scenes to surface what matters most. We’re currently in closed beta, working closely with early users to refine a system that feels intuitive but is powered by serious intelligence.” TrueNorth’s backers, Bryan Pellegrino of LayerZero, Jeff Feng of SEI, Jordi Alexander of Selini Capital, and Yongjin of Presto Labs, as well as Will Wang of Generative Ventures, share a strong belief in AI’s transformative power in crypto trading. Their interests span key themes such as interoperability, data-driven AI models, algorithmic market strategies, and innovative infrastructure development. Together, these interests reflect not only a shared belief in AI’s potential but also the same principles driving TrueNorth’s mission to simplify and personalize decision-making in decentralized markets. TrueNorth, a platform under Singapore-registered Advent AI, is working closely with its first 500 early users, the Truthsayers, to refine agentic workflows for AI-native investing in closed beta. In the coming weeks, the team will unveil key details of its advanced architecture and agentic frameworks as it gears up for a public launch aimed at delivering smarter, hyper-personalized crypto discovery tools to a wider audience.

45707426,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=743012,1749445601,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45707426.jpeg,Sam Altman’s Worldcoin has started using eye-scanning kiosks in several UK cities,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/sam-altmans-eye-scan-orbs-hit-uk-streets/,"Sam Altman’s World (formerly Worldcoin) project has launched its biometric eye‑scanning kiosks across the UK. Tools for Humanity, the startup co-founded by Altman, is bringing its futuristic eye-scanning Orbs to the UK as part of a broader global expansion of its identity verification platform. The project will give Brits access to verification services that entrepreneurs claim are essential to distinguish between human and artificial intelligence. Starting this week, residents in London, Manchester, Birmingham, Cardiff, Belfast, and Glasgow can scan their eyes using the company’s proprietary Orb devices, the company announced on Monday. The team seeks to expand the project scope, which made its US debut in April. World targets UK high streets with AI-driven identity verification According to Damien Kieran, Chief Legal and Privacy Officer at Tools for Humanity, the spherical Orbs will initially be located at dedicated premises in shopping centers and on high streets. The company also plans to partner with major retailers to install self-service Orbs similar to ATMs. “The UK is certainly one of the more influential markets in the world . . . it punches well above its weight globally,” said Adrian Ludwig, chief architect at Tools for Humanity, the primary developer behind World. He points out that the UK population is highly connected and already acutely aware of AI’s growing influence. Adria says in the UK, more than 75% of people report being impacted by AI almost daily. Project leaders warn that artificial intelligence is quickly approaching a point where it can convincingly mimic humans—largely due to advances made by companies like Altman’s own OpenAI. They predict that 90% of online content could be machine-generated within two years, making it increasingly difficult to tell the difference between humans and AI. Founded in 2019 by Altman and Alex Blania, Tools for Humanity has raised over $300 million from prominent backers such as Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, and Sam Bankman-Fried, the now-imprisoned founder of FTX. In May, the group raised an additional $135 million from investors, including Andreessen Horowitz and Bain Capital Crypto, to fund further orb development and international expansion. Tools for Humanity promotes its technology to distinguish humans from increasingly sophisticated AI systems. As generative AI tools—such as those developed by Altman’s OpenAI—proliferate, the risk of deepfakes, identity theft, and misinformation grows. The Orb scan generates a digital credential called World ID, based on the unique characteristics of a user’s iris. Those who opt-in can also receive the Worldcoin cryptocurrency token. Although the project currently has no revenue, World is exploring monetization options, including charging fees to partner platforms—such as dating apps like those under the Match Group umbrella—that use World ID services. World’s leadership sees the technology as a critical defense against digital fraud, AI impersonation, and automated misuse of online platforms—from bots buying up concert tickets to fake profiles infiltrating dating apps. Privacy concerns and global scrutiny shadow World’s expansion However, the project has not been without controversy. Regulatory authorities in Germany and Argentina have launched investigations over privacy concerns , while Spain and Hong Kong have issued outright bans. The company insists it does not store personal or biometric data; instead, verification data remains solely on the user’s device. Kieran said Tools for Humanity has been working ahead of its UK rollout with privacy regulators, including the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office. About 13 million people in countries like Mexico, Germany, Japan, Korea, Portugal, and Thailand have verified their identities through the technology. In April, the company announced expansion plans for six US cities. Currently, 1,500 Orbs are circulating globally, but Tools for Humanity aims to produce and ship an additional 12,000 devices over the next year.

The company announced on a June 9 blog post that it has partnered with Web3 Salon, a project supported by Japan’s External Trade Organization and powered by the Asia Web3 Alliance Japan, to provide targeted support for startups building on the XRP ( XRP ) Ledger. Through this program, Ripple will offer up to $200,000 per project over the next year. The grants will go to startups working on use cases like decentralized finance, tokenized real-world assets, and digital payments. This effort is part of Ripple’s Japan and Korea Fund and ties into a larger plan to support XRPL developers with financial, technical, and business help. The grant process will be managed directly by Ripple, which will select projects according to their technical quality, potential for growth, and fit with its objectives. Selected startups will receive funding as well as access to Ripple’s global network of partners and experts. You might also like: Japan eyes stricter crypto rules targeting insider trading: report Taking the lead in founder support, Web3 Salon will provide networking opportunities, workshops, and advice. Its goal will be to help startups grow, build stronger products, and connect with investors and regulators. Four community events through March 2026 are also part of the partnership. Startup pitches, investor sessions, panel discussions, and educational workshops on subjects like cross-border expansion and compliance will all be included in these events. Despite its clear crypto regulations and strong tech talent, Japan remains a difficult place for startups. Web3 Salon and Ripple hope to reduce the entry barrier and facilitate the growth and expansion of new teams. This move comes at a time when Ripple’s popularity in Japan continues to grow. The country’s clear legal framework for digital assets has attracted major players like SBI Holdings, a key Ripple partner and one of the most vocal supporters of XRP. SBI Remit, the biggest money transfer company in Japan, already uses RippleNet for international payments. Its cryptocurrency division, SBI VC Trade, allows institutional and retail customers to trade XRP. Meanwhile, major platforms like Mercari have started offering XRP to users through their apps, and large companies like Open House Group now accept XRP for real estate purchases. With support from Ripple, Web3 Salon, and JETRO, this new initiative could give Japan’s Web3 scene a meaningful push and help bring new ideas to life on the XRP Ledger.

Additionally, crypto markets have settled a little following the volatility in the wake of the spat between US President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk late last week. However, some of that may return this week when key inflation and consumer sentiment reports are released. On top of this, the next round of US-China trade talks is scheduled to begin on Monday, commented the Kobeissi Letter. Economic Events June 9 to 13 The most impactful report of the week is May’s Consumer Price Index CPI which is one of the two key measures of inflation. Central bank policymakers and investors closely monitor the CPI report as it reflects price trends across the economy and shapes sentiment. The May CPI report is likely to confirm that price pressures remain elevated, according to analysts. May’s Producer Price Index (PPI) report will follow the CPI on Thursday, reflecting input costs for producers and manufacturers. PPI measures the cost of producing consumer goods, which ultimately impacts retail prices, and is viewed as a leading indicator of inflationary pressures. June’s Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index and Consumer Inflation Expectations preliminary readings are due on Friday. These reports summarize consumer confidence and long-term inflation expectations, which can impact spending and overall economic growth. Key Events This Week: 1. Atlanta Fed GDPNow data – Monday 2. May CPI Inflation data – Wednesday 3. 10-Year Note Auction -Wednesday 4. May PPI Inflation data – Thursday 5. Michigan Inflation Expectations data – Friday 6. Michigan Consumer Sentiment data – Friday This marks… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) June 8, 2025 This marks the last week of inflation data before the June Fed meeting. According to the CME Fed Watch tool, there is a 99.9% probability that interest rates will remain unchanged at the June 18 central bank meeting. Crypto Market Outlook Crypto markets have dipped a little over the past 24 hours, with a 2% decline in total capitalization, which dropped to $3.41 trillion during Monday morning trading in Asia. Overall, markets remain range-bound bound having recovered from their Friday fall and holding steady over the weekend. Bitcoin topped $106,000 during late trading on Sunday but declined a little to $105,600 on Monday, June 9. Aside from Friday’s dip, it has remained within this tight trading channel since the end of May. Ethereum is holding steady around the $2,500 price zone, failing to break resistance above $2,700 but also not slumping back towards $2,000. Most of the altcoins are generally flat with minor gains for XRP and ICP, and further losses for memecoins.

On Sunday, he posted a chart of the company’s BTC holdings, touting that Strategy aims to increase its Bitcoin purchases. “Send more Orange,” his message read, as Orange is widely recognized as a symbol for Bitcoin among the crypto community. Send more Orange pic.twitter.com/QaLJWkLrVN — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 8, 2025 This marks the firm’s ninth week in a row of buying Bitcoin, if the post follows a potential acquisition. The corporation bought 705 BTC for almost $75 million between May 26 and June 1. The firm currently holds 580,955 BTC, worth approximately $61.4 billion at current values, according to Bitcoin Treasuries data . Michael Saylor has a history of posting on Sundays before his Bitcoin purchases. However, a recent report from K33 Research revealed that Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, appears to have slowed down its Bitcoin buys. This is due to a declining premium for MSTR shares relative to the company’s Bitcoin holdings, K33 Head of Research Vetle Lunde attributed. ’Strategy Is Fully Torqued Bitcoin’: Michael Saylor On June 7, Saylor posted a victorious message on X, sharing an infographic on how Bitcoin has helped Strategy outperform other major tech titans, including Tesla, Meta and Nvidia. “Strategy is fully torqued Bitcoin,” he wrote on X, with a 126% increase in terms of a year return growth.

Per the announcement, the company aims to issue 11,764,700 shares of 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock, at a public offering price of $85.00 per share. “Strategy intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and for working capital,” the announcement read. Bitcoin Treasury Race Heats Up: What Could Be Next? Following Strategy’s lead, there has been an intensifying competition among corporations entering the Bitcoin treasury space. Japan’s Metaplanet, for instance, has been stochpiling Bitcoin continuously, with a new target to accumulate 210,000 BTC by 2027 . The Tokyo-listed investment firm currently holds 8,888 BTC, placing it tenth globally in corporate Bitcoin holdings. Michael Saylor’s Sunday endorsement could signal sustained positive sentiment among traders and potentially increase institutional accumulation. Though, monitoring Saylor’s social activity could be relevant for short-term trading strategies, as institutional sentiment could lead to price volatility.

Market participants also turned their attention to upcoming US-China trade talks , senior officials from the U.S. and China are set to begin a new round of talks in London today, signaling easing trade tensions. Gold prices dropped to around $3,300 per ounce on Monday, marking a third consecutive session of decline and reaching its lowest level in a week. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.89% to above 38,000 while the broader Topix Index gained 0.7% to 2,788 on Monday, with Japanese shares rising for the second straight session. The Japanese yen appreciated past 144.5 per US dollar on Monday, rebounding after two consecutive days of losses, as revised data showed the country’s first-quarter GDP was flat. Japan's economy was flat in the first quarter —an improvement from the previously reported 0.2% contraction. While the revision was positive, it still marked a notable slowdown from the 0.6% growth seen in the final quarter of 2024. Adding to the mixed economic picture, Japan’s current account surplus narrowed in April and came in below market expectations. The gauge for Japan’s service sector rose to 44.4 in May 2025, up from 42.6 in the previous month — its lowest level since February 2022 — and above market expectations of 43.9. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.33% to above 3,390 while the Shenzhen Component gained 0.9% to 10,277 on Monday, with mainland stocks reaching multi-week highs as officials from Beijing and Washington are set to resume trade negotiations in London later today, and the offshore yuan strengthened to around 7.18 per dollar on Monday, ending a two-session losing streak, supported by potential easing of US-China trade tensions that overshadowed deflationary concerns. Meanwhile, deepening deflationary concerns pressured yields as China’s consumer prices fell for a fourth straight month and producer prices saw their steepest drop in nearly two years. Separately, the latest trade data revealed a decline in imports, driven by weak consumption. Although export growth missed forecasts even with a temporary US trade truce, the country still achieved a $103 billion surplus, surpassing estimates.

Here’s how,https://timestabloid.com/you-can-borrow-against-xrp-to-buy-real-estate-and-be-your-own-bank-heres-how/,"Crypto commentator MrAQUAMAN33 has presented a concept of financial independence through the use of digital assets, specifically XRP, in the acquisition of real estate. In a post on X, he wrote, “XRP Millionaire? Borrow Against Crypto to Buy Real Estate! BE YOUR OWN BANK.” He captioned a video in which the speaker elaborates on a potential strategy for leveraging digital assets without the need to liquidate them. The video references a comment from someone named Sergei, who posed the idea of earning yield from the equity in a property. The speaker responds by clarifying this idea and addressing skepticism, stating that viewers should not be dismissive. $XRP Millionaire? Borrow Against Crypto to Buy Real Estate! BE YOUR OWN BANK pic.twitter.com/ZnXf2wSfan — Mr.AquaMan.33𝕏 (@MrAQUAMAN33) June 7, 2025 Using XRP as Collateral Through Metal X Lending The speaker proposes a hypothetical scenario in which an individual becomes a multimillionaire through XRP holdings. In this example, the person owns $10 million worth of XRP . Rather than selling the digital asset to access funds, the individual uses a decentralized, non-custodial protocol—Metal X Lending—to borrow against their XRP holdings. He explains that this lending platform allows the user to access capital by using their XRP as collateral, with no set repayment timeframe and minimal interest costs, described as “usually a sliver of a percent to pay it back.” With this approach, the individual can borrow, for example, $2 million to purchase a cash home, without selling any XRP. The transaction is described as a self-issued loan using one’s crypto assets. Tokenizing the Property on Blockchain After acquiring the home with borrowed funds, the next step outlined in the video involves tokenizing the purchased property. The speaker refers to platforms that facilitate this process, specifically naming Lofty, which operates on the Algorand blockchain, and another emerging project, PRYPCO Mint Project. According to him, PRYPCO is a regulated initiative based in Dubai that is developing real estate tokenization on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 He emphasizes that this is not theoretical but an active opportunity, describing PRYPCO’s project as one that participants “can partake in right now.” The concept of tokenized real estate is presented as a key innovation, with the speaker stressing the importance of regulation in PRYPCO’s framework, highlighting its alignment with compliant practices in Dubai’s regulatory environment. A Model for Digital Asset Utility in Traditional Markets This vision presents a strategy for retaining ownership of digital assets while simultaneously using them to gain access to real-world property. By leveraging lending protocols like Metal X Lending, XRP holders could theoretically avoid selling their tokens and instead treat them as collateral. The borrowed funds could be used to make high-value purchases, such as real estate, while the asset is held and potentially continues to appreciate. The second phase, involving tokenization, is framed as a way to integrate the property into the digital asset ecosystem. Through platforms like Lofty or PRYPCO, the tokenized real estate could potentially be fractionalized or yield-generating, depending on the platform’s functionality and regulatory standing. The overall message is directed at individuals who believe in the future value of XRP and other digital assets. The speaker’s position is clear: with the appropriate tools and platforms, holders of crypto assets do not need to rely on traditional banks or liquidate their holdings to access capital or acquire physical assets, such as real estate. Instead, they can “be their own bank,” as the tweet’s caption suggests, by using decentralized protocols and asset tokenization in combination.

A low-priced token appears out of nowhere, gathers a loyal following, and then explodes, creating millionaires in the process. It happened with Bitcoin. It happened with Ethereum. And now, many believe it’s happening again, with a newcomer that might just be the smartest blockchain upgrade we’ve seen: Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S). While the price is still in presale, early investors are already calculating a jaw-dropping 233% return before the token even hits exchanges. Can Bitcoin’s Original Vision Still Compete? Bitcoin is a legend—and rightly so. It introduced the world to decentralized money and a fixed-supply model that revolutionized finance. But despite its strength as digital gold, Bitcoin’s limitations are clear: slow transaction speeds, minimal scalability, and no built-in support for smart contracts. In contrast, Bitcoin Solaris takes that core legacy and injects it with 2025-grade innovation, delivering not just security and scarcity but speed, programmability, and broad usability. The Powerhouse Behind Bitcoin Solaris’s Rise At its heart, Bitcoin Solaris is built for one thing: evolution. It doesn’t aim to replace Bitcoin—it aims to finish what it started. The network uses a dual-layer architecture to solve the trilemma of decentralization, scalability, and speed. The Base Layer runs on SHA-256, the same algorithm that powers Bitcoin, and supports standard mining hardware with a 5-minute block time. Above it, the Solaris Layer operates using Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)—featuring 21 rotating validators, dynamic 32MB blocks, and 15-second confirmations. Together, these layers achieve over 10,000 TPS while staying energy-efficient and secure. And that’s not all. Validator elections, slashing mechanisms, and synchronization between layers ensure stability and fairness across the board. While traditional chains struggle with either speed or security, Bitcoin Solaris bridges both with technical mastery. The Future of Decentralization Is Already Mining—Start with BTC-S Why the Presale Is Gaining Serious Momentum With less than 8 weeks left before its official launch, the Bitcoin Solaris presale is turning heads fast: Current Price: $6 Next Phase: $7 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 10% Over 11,000 users have already joined the presale, and more than $3 million has been raised. This makes it one of the shortest and most explosive presales in recent memory. Investors are chasing a projected 1,900% return, and today marks the final day of Phase 6. The clock is ticking. In a recent in-depth review, Ben Crypto highlighted why so many crypto enthusiasts are calling this the presale of the year, diving into both the scalability and security features that set BTC-S apart. Smart Contracts That Actually Do Something While many chains talk about smart contracts , Bitcoin Solaris builds them for the real world. Rust-based contracts bring enterprise-grade flexibility to the network. DeFi lending, borrowing, tokenized real estate, play-to-earn economies, supply chain tracking—BTC-S supports them all from day one. Here’s what makes it truly special: Rust-based contracts, deployed using Solana’s toolset for seamless developer adoption Cross-chain bridges to connect with Ethereum, Solana, and others Near-instant finality with 2-second confirmation speeds Application support spanning DeFi, gaming, IoT, healthcare, education, and digital identity. The Hidden Wealth Engine Here’s where Bitcoin Solaris really earns its title as the next Bitcoin: mining. But not as you know it. Two-thirds of BTC-S (66.67%) is allocated to mining rewards over time. Mining requires users to hold BTC-S, reducing sell pressure and strengthening long-term value Accessible via desktop, browser, and through the upcoming Solaris Nova app, which is designed for everyday users Unlike traditional systems where whales and server farms dominate, BTC-S distributes opportunity through design. Even holding tokens can power the network and generate returns. It’s a wealth system engineered for mass participation, not just the elite. Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Solaris: What’s Actually Different? Feature Bitcoin Bitcoin Solaris Transaction Speed ~7 TPS 10,000+ TPS Smart Contracts None Full Rust-based support Energy Consumption High 99.95% Lower Validator Governance None On-chain, DPoS validator system Mining Method PoW only PoW + DPoS hybrid Mobile Accessibility None Mining via browser + app Use Case Focus Digital gold Full ecosystem (DeFi, NFTs, etc.) How Bitcoin Solaris Could Make You Rich Bitcoin Solaris isn’t promising overnight riches. It’s offering architecture that rewards smart participation. It’s built with value-holders in mind, not just hype-chasers. With a fixed 21M cap, long-term staking and mining incentives, and a scarcity design straight from Bitcoin’s playbook, it’s not hard to see how early holders could win big. As adoption increases and the ecosystem grows, the upward pressure on BTC-S will come not from marketing—but from function. From holding, using, and participating.

Pavel, what first pulled you into crypto? And how did you become such an early builder and investor specifically within Telegram’s blockchain ecosystem? It was Bitcoin in early 2017 that first pulled me into crypto, but what truly captured my interest was the underlying technology. That curiosity led me to follow Telegram’s blockchain efforts from the early days of the GRAM ICO in 2018. I’ve been tracking it closely ever since. In 2022, I invested in TON, driven by the conviction that its deep integration with Telegram could unlock massive potential. I dove deeper into the ecosystem, and soon began contributing, starting with the launch of the first liquid staking platform on TON in early 2023. That experience paved the way for our next chapter: building TAC. It’s been a natural evolution of our belief in TON and its future as a core part of the Telegram ecosystem. 2.

The numbers reflect routine market adjustments but offer a pulse on investor sentiment heading into mid-2025. BTC Down, ETH Up, USDT Slightly Lower According to the report, Binance users now collectively hold 593,000 BTC, representing a 1.82% drop from May 1. In contrast, Ethereum holdings have risen by 1.05% to 5.337 million ETH, signaling slight investor confidence in ETH despite recent market turbulence. USDT balances saw a mild dip of 0.77%, now totaling 28.83 billion, marking a decline of $223 million over the past month. These figures come amid market fluctuations and ongoing demand for transparency from major exchanges. Binance remains the second-largest crypto reserve holder globally, with approximately $110 billion across BTC, ETH, USDT, and USDC. Coinbase still leads the pack with $129 billion under custody, as noted in earlier reports. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple Launches Japan-Focused Web3 Program Backed by JETRO , BNB Dips Below $650 Post-Report Following the update, Binance’s native token BNB slipped below $650, currently trading at $649.89, despite posting a modest 0.15% gain over 24 hours.

Will an agreement boost confidence in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum? Or could new tensions make prices swing wildly? Let’s see what could happen? US-China Trade Talk Set For Today Recently, U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will meet Chinese officials in London on Monday, June 9, 2025. Meanwhile, China confirmed that Vice Premier He Lifeng will join these discussions. However, this meeting comes after Trump had a “very good talk” with China’s President Xi Jinping last week, the first time they spoke since the trade war began in February. US-China Trade Battle The trade war between the US and China started earlier this year when President Trump raised taxes on products from China by 125% . China fought back with higher taxes on US products, and tensions between the two countries kept growing. At one point, trade tariffs climbed as high as 145%, creating massive uncertainty for businesses and financial markets worldwide. Perhaps, in May, a temporary truce was reached in Switzerland, with the US reducing tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% and China slashing its tariffs to 10%. Trade’s Impact On Crypto Market While all eyes are on these talks, crypto experts have a special reason to watch. In past trade disputes, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have acted as a haven when markets felt shaky. If Monday’s talks go well and the US and China agree to ease trade tensions, it could calm investors and lead to more stable crypto prices. But if talks collapse or tariffs rise again, Bitcoin and altcoins might see a surge as people look for assets that aren’t tied to governments or global politics. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump Coin & Tesla Stock Crash Big Amid Elon Musk & Donald Trump Feud: Here’s What’s Next! , Sentiment Shifting Towards Crypto On top of that, data from Santiment shows that more people are buying crypto than ever.

It currently broke out of a key resistance line and now appears poised for a bullish move on the daily chart. Unlike many other mid-cap altcoins, ICP saw less recovery during the last leg up due to low demand. It subjected the bearish trend to sideways movement and remained relatively indecisive on the weekly chart. The sideways movement came with a correction after managing to tap $6.2 last month, and crypto remained weak again. Luckily for the bulls, the $4.8 level produced support this week and the price bounced back. That led to a three-day surge, and the price broke slightly out of a month resistance line to where it is changing hands at $5.6. This break signals a potential bullish move, and from the look of things, the trend is likely to shift in favour of the bulls soon. Although it is important to note that ICP is still trading inside the bearish zone on a mid-term scale. A clear push above the previous monthly high should set the market up for a big price movement in the short term. Currently, the bears are off the market on the daily scale. If they manage to step back with a pull below the $4 level, we may consider more downtrends on the mid-term scale. But with the current surge in demand level, more positive actions can be expected. ICP’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview The rising leg up is targeted at the $6.37 resistance level. An increase above this level could rally the price to the $7.74 resistance. Above it lies the $9 level. Aside from the $4.8 level recently held as support, the $4.2 level is considered the main support for a dip. A breakdown from there could slide us to $3.5. Key Resistance Levels: $6.37, $7.74, $9 Key Support Levels: $4.8, $4.2, $3.5 Spot Price: $5.64 Trend: Bullish Volatility: Highs Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The decentralized exchange unveiled its post-relaunch strategy in a June 8 blog post , outlining measures to enhance protocol security, upgrade monitoring systems, and transition toward full open-sourcing. A newly structured white hat bounty programme has also been introduced to support community-driven security efforts. According to the team, all affected CLMM pools have now been replenished using a combination of recovered assets, treasury funds, and a $30 million loan from the Sui Foundation. Liquidity providers will regain access to their previous positions, with recovery rates ranging from 85% to 99%, depending on the extent of the damage to each pool. To compensate for unrecovered losses, Cetus has allocated 15% of its native CETUS token supply to affected users. Of this, 5% will be immediately claimable, while the remaining 10% will be unlocked monthly over the next year, starting June 10. The team clarified that the 15% CETUS allocation introduces no new inflation, as it repurposes unvested team tokens within the existing supply cap. Compensation claims will be tied to LP position NFTs, which will remain valid as certificates for CETUS redemption, even after liquidity is withdrawn. The protocol has also completed new security audits covering all code patches, contract upgrades, and the compensation contract. Additional rounds of audits and real-time threat detection upgrades are planned to further strengthen protocol resilience.

In the immediate aftermath, the Cetus team froze operations and began working with Sui validators to recover assets. An on-chain governance vote held on May 29 approved the transfer of $162 million in frozen funds to a multisig wallet for recovery. Further, the Sui Foundation supported the effort with a dedicated USDC loan to backstop off-chain losses. Cetus stated that legal proceedings are ongoing in multiple jurisdictions, with law enforcement agencies actively engaged. The attacker, who declined a $6 million white-hat bounty, is reportedly attempting to launder assets, although the team claims that most movements remain traceable. “We are highly confident that successful arrest and recovering the remaining assets is only a matter of time,” Cetus wrote in the latest announcement. If additional funds are recovered during the compensation period, users will have the option to redeem CETUS for USDC. Once that period ends, remaining funds will be used for token buybacks and deposited into the community treasury. The latest announcement, however, failed to lift CETUS, which fell around 7% on the day, extending a downtrend that began in May.

In fact, Michael Saylor hinted at another purchase after a recent $1 billion stock offering. Meanwhile, the crypto community is pressuring Elon Musk to fully embrace Bitcoin as tensions grow between him and Donald Trump. Bitcoin Family Overhauls Security Didi Taihuttu, the patriarch of the well-known “Bitcoin Family,” implemented a sweeping overhaul of his digital asset security measures in response to the growing wave of violent crimes targeting cryptocurrency holders. The Taihuttu family famously committed to an all-Bitcoin lifestyle in 2017, and took drastic steps to safeguard their crypto assets by spreading their private key information across four continents. In a recent interview with CNBC, Taihuttu revealed that the family no longer relies solely on hardware wallets. Instead, they now employ a hybrid security model that includes blockchain-based storage systems and physically distributed components of their seed phrases. Bitcoin Family According to Taihuttu, their seed phrase has been encrypted, divided into four parts, and stored using a combination of fireproof metal plates and blockchain solutions. These plates are hidden in undisclosed physical locations worldwide. To strengthen the setup even more, Taihuttu altered some of the words in the seed phrase. This means that even if someone were to obtain part of it, they wouldn’t be able to access the assets without knowing the correct contextual modifications. He also pointed out that even under coercion, he could not give away more than what is immediately accessible on his phone or wallet, which contains only a small portion of their holdings. (Source: CNBC ) The shift in strategy happened due to a surge in crypto-linked crimes. Over the past few months, there has been a disturbing increase in kidnappings, extortion, and violent assaults on crypto users around the world. Taihuttu and his family chose to stop posting real-time updates of their travels due to safety concerns, as threats from individuals who tracked their movements online became too serious to ignore. Although the family continues to live a global, nomadic lifestyle, they now take better precautions to shield their movements and protect their digital wealth. Under their new model, about 65% of the family’s crypto assets are secured in cold storage, while their hot wallets, which are used for trading and daily expenses, are guarded using multisignature protocols. Between late 2024 and early 2025, several high-profile cases made headlines across the globe, including a January conviction of gang members in the UK for kidnapping and torturing a crypto investor. There was also a February case in Chicago where six men abducted a family and demanded $15 million in digital assets. In March, popular streamer Kaitlyn Siragusa, who is known online as “Amouranth,” endured a terrifying home invasion where armed intruders demanded crypto transfers. One of the most alarming incidents occurred on May 13 in Paris, when three masked men tried to kidnap the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium. Noizat’s daughter bravely resisted the attackers, and even managed to disarm one of them before bystanders intervened. Strategy Signals New Bitcoin Buy Despite this very concerning rise in crypto-targeted crimes, people and companies are still accumulating Bitcoin. Michael Saylor, the co-founder and executive chairman of Strategy, caused speculation of another major Bitcoin purchase after posting a cryptic message, “Send more Orange,” on X on June 8. Saylor is known for teasing Bitcoin acquisitions through posts like these, and if history repeats, Strategy could soon announce another buy. The timing follows Strategy’s recent acquisition of 705 BTC between May 26 and June 1 for approximately $75 million at an average price of $106,495 per coin. This brought the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 580,955 BTC, which is valued at roughly $61.4 billion. According to SaylorTracker , the firm is currently sitting on an unrealized profit of about $20.6 billion. This is a 50% gain on its Bitcoin investment. Strategy’s aggressive accumulation continues to be fueled by capital raises, with the latest being a $1 billion stock offering . This greatly expands on its initial $250 million raise and is aimed at financing even more Bitcoin purchases as well as general corporate needs. The new offering includes 11.76 million shares of its 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock, priced at $85 each. After expenses, the company expects to net approximately $979 million. The preferred shares feature non-cumulative 10% dividends, appealing to institutional investors seeking yield while giving Strategy predictable financing to deepen its Bitcoin exposure. The company’s bold approach makes it the largest known Bitcoin holder in the world, surpassing even the combined Bitcoin reserves of the United States and China. Strategy’s holdings are nearly 12 times bigger than those of the second-largest public Bitcoin holder, mining firm Mara Holdings. As a result, many investors now see Strategy as a de facto Bitcoin ETF alternative that offers direct exposure to the asset through corporate equity. Elon Musk Pressured to Go All In on Bitcoin Members of the Bitcoin community are also urging Tesla CEO Elon Musk to go all in on Bitcoin as tensions escalate between Musk and US President Donald Trump. The public feud became a lightning rod for crypto advocates, who see it as an opportunity for Musk to strike back by embracing Bitcoin more aggressively. Crypto analyst Will Clemente posted on X that “the best way for Elon to get back at Trump is by full porting Bitcoin.” JAN3 CEO Samson Mow directly called on Musk to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy and resume accepting BTC for Tesla purchases. Mow also suggested that Musk’s space venture, SpaceX, offer launch discounts to customers who pay in Bitcoin. He said that it’s time to “force a hard money standard on the money printers.” This follows his criticism of Trump for failing to follow through after signing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve executive order. He also pointed out that the US has yet to acquire more Bitcoin and risks falling behind other nations. Mow even warned Musk to act before facing potential financial restrictions, and suggested that “at least do it before they freeze your fiat assets.” Others in the crypto space speculated that if Musk truly committed to Bitcoin, it would be on a massive scale. Boyd Cohen , CEO of Lomob, said Musk would likely pursue the biggest BTC treasury in the world and integrate Bitcoin across all his companies. He added that Musk could emerge as a leading global advocate for Bitcoin. The backdrop to this renewed push for Musk’s Bitcoin alignment is a growing personal and political rift with Trump. Their feud reignited after Musk publicly criticized Trump’s tax bill on June 3 by calling it a “disgusting abomination,” and intensified when Musk warned that Trump’s proposed global tariffs could trigger a recession later this year. In response, Trump claimed that canceling Musk’s federal subsidies and contracts could save the government billions of dollars. Musk has long shown interest in cryptocurrency,and recently announced that X will roll out XChats , a messaging feature with “Bitcoin-style encryption.” Although Tesla discontinued Bitcoin payments in 2021 due to environmental concerns, the company still holds digital assets, though the value of its holdings fell from $1.076 billion to $951 million in the first quarter of this year.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-09 06:14:06

In a new strategy session, pseudonymous analyst Cheds tells his 49,700 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin looks strong on the weekly chart after breaking out from a cup-and-handle pattern. In technical analysis, a cup-and-handle pattern is a bullish continuation structure indicating that an asset is primed to move higher after a period of consolidation. The second bullish signal, according to Cheds, is that the uptrend appears technically sound based on how much time Bitcoin spent forming a solid base between $16,000 and $70,000. And third, the trader says the depth of the consolidation range in the last three years is likely enough to sustain rallies above $200,000 in 2026. “It’s still my base case, and this is just a very general outline. I think we have a pretty good chance of mid-$250,000 in 2026. That seems kind of aggressive, I know. But the funny thing is that this has been a conservative target for some people because people are talking about [hitting $250,000] this year. Absolutely not. That’s crazy… There is zero chance of $250,000 this year, but I think it’s a decent chance of mid-$250,000 just based on the height of the cup-and-handle [pattern], and the time interval and the consolidation range… That’s still my general idea, just based on the weekly trajectory.” Source: Cheds/YouTube At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $105,706.

He described the concerns as partly a marketing tactic by those promoting new quantum concept tokens. Saylor believes that major firms like Google and Microsoft would not support the development of quantum computers that could break modern encryption. He argued that such developments could undermine the security of their systems and operations. Saylor expects Bitcoin to counter quantum threat with software upgrades NEW‼️- ARE YOU WORRIED QUANTUM COMPUTING WILL BREAK BITCOIN? 💥 MICHAEL SAYLOR: pic.twitter.com/CVeFWXML4H — Neil Jacobs (@NeilJacobs) June 6, 2025 BlackRock considers Quantum computers, with their ability to outperform classical binary computers and break traditional encryption, a threat to crypto. Michael Saylor dismissed Quantum’s threat to Bitcoin, saying that the BTC protocol would implement a software upgrade when the threat becomes imminent. Saylor responded to concerns about the threat of computers soon being able to break the encryption that enables the scarcity of Bitcoin. He also believes that major tech companies can’t sell to customers a computer that can breach BTC’s cryptography because it would destroy them and the entire banking industry. “It’s mainly marketing from people that want to sell you the next quantum yo-yo token. Google and Microsoft aren’t going to sell you a computer that cracks modern cryptography because it would destroy Google and Microsoft – and the U.S. Government and the banking system.” -Michael Saylor, CEO at Strategy. The quantum sector has had several proposals about how to secure Proof of Work against the quantum threat, including from BTQ Technologies, a startup building quantum-proof crypto hardware. One BTC developer has also introduced a draft Bitcoin Improvement Protocol that proposes a hard fork to move everyone’s wallets to quantum-secure addresses. Saylor argued that the bigger security threat for Bitcoin is phishing, noting that the digital asset is a protocol that gets upgraded yearly. Presto Research also acknowledged in a recent report that the crypto industry is unprepared for the coming quantum threat. Google also suggested in new research that RSA encryption, a critical security feature used in securing Bitcoin, may be more susceptible to quantum computing attacks than previously anticipated. The Quantum AI researcher Craig Gidney, published a new report indicating that RSA encryption could be broken with 20 times fewer quantum resources than previously estimated. He noted that a quantum computer could theoretically break the 2048-bit RSA encryption with 1 million qubits running for one week. Gidney did not mention digital assets, although the Elliptic Curve Cryptographic algorithm, which secures transactions on BTC with public and private keys, is similar in principle to the RSA. A previous study also suggested that despite Elliptic Curve Cryptography being secure against classical computers, a strong enough quantum computer could effectively crack it in the years to come. Google’s latest next-generation quantum chip, Willow, has also ignited concerns over Bitcoin’s cryptography. The firm said the chip could solve a standard benchmark computation in under five minutes, a task that would take the world’s fastest supercomputers 10 septillions years to solve. Hunter wants the BTC community to focus on preparedness rather than denial A study led by the University of Kent’s School of Computing suggested that BTC might need to undergo a costly and time-consuming update process to counter the threat of quantum computing in the future. CTO and co-founder of self-custody service Casa, Jameson Lopp, also argued that Bitcoin’s community has less than a decade to implement contingency plans. According to a study published by Deloitte, 25% of BTC’s circulating supply is vulnerable to quantum attacks because their associated wallets’ keys have been exposed. The firm also found that the sum totaling 4 million Bitcoin at the time is worth nearly $42 billion, based on current prices. Anduro Senior Protocol Engineer Hunter Beast and Marathon Director of Engineering Michael B. Casey suggested that Bitcoin’s algorithms could be cracked with zero warning. The experts also argued that attackers would get far less in the case of a breach. They believe that if BTC’s algorithms are cracked, it could immediately depress the asset’s price during a liquidation event. Beast and Casey acknowledged that Bitcoin can be secured against quantum threats by moving funds to a wallet that hasn’t had its public key exposed yet. They also noted it could be impossible for actors that have lost their keys or impractical for exchanges that let the public make on-chain deposits. Beast emphasized that the community should lean towards preparedness instead of denial.

The company will issue new shares through a structure similar to an “at-the-market” program, widely used in the US. TOBAM will subscribe to shares at the market price, with each tranche capped at 21% of the previous day’s trading volume. The offering is designed to gradually increase the number of bitcoins held per share on a fully diluted basis, reinforcing Blockchain Group’s Bitcoin-first balance sheet strategy. TOBAM Could Overtake Fulgur Ventures and Adam Back in Shareholding Under the arrangement, TOBAM will consolidate its weekly requests, and Blockchain Group will publish the total number of shares issued and the Bitcoin purchases made from each round.

However, it is not acting as a financial intermediary and will not receive a fee. The fund manager retains the option to hold or sell its subscribed shares. If TOBAM takes up its full allocation and chooses to retain the shares, it could own over 39% of Blockchain Group’s capital. That would make it the company’s largest single shareholder. Currently, Blockchain Group’s investor base includes notable names like cryptographer Adam Back and venture firm Fulgur Ventures. Source: The Blockchain Group Blockchain Group Ramps Up Bitcoin Strategy After $68.6M BTC Buy The announcement follows Blockchain Group’s $68.6m purchase of 624 Bitcoins last week, accelerating its expansion into digital assets. This acquisition brought the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 1,437, now valued at more than $150m. It also marked one of the largest Bitcoin treasury allocations by a publicly traded firm in Europe. The move follows a shareholder resolution passed in February. That resolution approved capital raises targeting strategic investors in areas like Web3 and AI. Now, a second resolution under review could raise the limit from $40.4m to $538.5m. If passed, it would give the board greater flexibility to extend the program. Amid rising inflation and broader economic uncertainty, firms are rethinking traditional treasury models. Against that backdrop, Blockchain Group’s aggressive shift toward Bitcoin reflects growing institutional belief in the asset as a long-term store of value.

These low-priced digital coins have the potential to yield huge returns, catching the attention of investors looking for big gains. This article explores how these affordable tokens could lead to significant wins in the coming bull market. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Approaches the $15M Milestone The XYZVerse ($XYZ) project, which merges the worlds of sports and crypto, has attracted significant investor interest. Unlike typical memecoins, XYZVerse positions itself as a long-term initiative with a clear roadmap and an engaged community. The project was recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project , further solidifying its appeal. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.003333, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.005. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $13 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $15 million . This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse , the community calls the plays . Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price , and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More – Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Luna Classic’s Comeback: Is LUNC Set to Soar? Luna Classic (LUNC) is the original token of the Terra blockchain, a platform that aims to make global payments faster and more stable. Terra uses stablecoins, which are digital coins linked to real-world currencies like the US dollar and the South Korean won. This means people can send money across the world quickly and cheaply, without worrying about big price changes. In May 2022, Terra launched a new version of its blockchain and renamed the original one to Terra Classic. The old token became Luna Classic (LUNC), much like how Ethereum split into Ethereum and Ethereum Classic in 2017. Now, many are wondering if LUNC has a bright future in today’s crypto market. Its technology offers the benefits of regular money combined with the openness of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. With rising interest in stable and reliable digital payments, LUNC could attract users looking for quick and affordable transactions. However, after the collapse of Terra’s stablecoin UST in 2022, some investors are cautious. The success of LUNC may depend on how well it can rebuild trust and show stability compared to other coins. In a market filled with options, LUNC stands out with its unique story and potential for growth. Stellar Lumens: Connecting the World with Fast and Affordable Payments Imagine sending money across the globe as easily as sending a text message. That’s what Stellar and its cryptocurrency, Lumens (XLM), aim to do. Since 2014, Stellar has been making money transfers quick and cheap. It doesn’t favor any one country’s currency and works with all kinds, including digital versions of dollars or even Bitcoin. Instead of trying to replace banks, Stellar seeks to bring them together on a single network, allowing them to work seamlessly with each other. In today’s market, where speed and low fees are more important than ever, Stellar stands out. It has processed billions of transactions and partnered with major companies looking to tap into its technology. Developers can build apps on Stellar, and businesses can use it for payments or currency exchange. While some cryptocurrencies focus on narrow goals, Stellar’s broad approach to improving global finance makes it an attractive option. If you’re watching the trends, XLM’s real-world uses and strong partnerships make it a coin worth paying attention to. Kaspa: A Faster and Smarter Cryptocurrency Revolution Kaspa is a new kind of cryptocurrency that’s aiming to change the way we think about digital money. Unlike traditional systems, Kaspa uses a method called GHOSTDAG, which lets multiple blocks of data exist side by side instead of discarding any. This means transactions can be processed much faster—right now, one every second, with hopes to reach 10 or even 100 per second. Kaspa’s technology allows for quick confirmations, so you don’t have to wait long for your transaction to go through. It also has features like Reachability to explore the network and ways to reduce data storage needs through pruning. In the world of cryptocurrencies, speed and efficiency are more important than ever. Kaspa’s approach sets it apart from others like Bitcoin, which can be slower because of how their blockchains work. With plans to support more advanced applications through layer 2 solutions, Kaspa is positioning itself as a forward-thinking player in the crypto space. As the market evolves, coins that offer fast transactions and scalable technology could gain more attention. While the future is always uncertain, Kaspa’s innovative methods might put it in a good position in the current cycle. JasmyCoin: Taking Back Control of Your Data in a Connected World In today’s world, our devices—phones, cars, computers—are constantly collecting data. JasmyCoin (JASMY), a cryptocurrency from Tokyo-based Jasmy Corporation, aims to change how we handle this personal information. By combining Internet of Things (IoT) technology with blockchain, Jasmy provides a platform where users can securely store and control their data. Instead of big companies owning your information, Jasmy lets you decide who can access it, turning your data into your personal asset. Jasmy’s approach is timely, especially with growing concerns over data privacy. By decentralizing data storage and using systems like IPFS, Jasmy offers a secure and user-friendly environment. In the current market, where cryptocurrencies are seeking real-world applications, JasmyCoin stands out by addressing a pressing need. Compared to other coins that focus on financial transactions, JASMY is carving a niche in data sovereignty. With data becoming the new oil, investing in a platform that empowers users could be a promising opportunity. Conclusion LUNC, XLM, KAS, and JASMY offer potential, but $XYZ’s sports-meme ecosystem aims for 20,000% growth, giving early adopters a unique opportunity in the bull run.

In a recent interview on the YouTube channel The Diary of a CEO, Wood breaks down the main reasons why she believes BTC ( BTC )’s value is bound to skyrocket to at least $1.5 million within the next few years. The ARK Investment CEO mentioned several core pillars which make up the “building blocks” of BTC’s growth in the market. One of the major drivers is institutional investments from corporate holders such as Arkham, Strategy and Metaplanet. “Bitcoin is more of an investment because it does appreciate overtime. Now you go through [it], it’s volatile. No question. And that’s the first thing people have to know about it. But it is becoming less volatile as more and more investors hold it,” she said in the interview. According to Wood, a lot of institutional investors have just started to gravitating towards BTC. Therefore, she believes the crypto space will see a flurry of demand from institutional holders who see the appeal of Bitcoin as a new asset class that offers diversification for business portfolios. Wood remarked that the world has not had a new asset class since the 1600s with the introduction of equities. Since then, the global market’s has been occupied by the same traditional assets including stocks , bonds, commodities and real estate . However now, there is a recent shift towards Bitcoin as a desirable asset. “If this asset does not perform like other assets, in other words, it provides diversification for funds. And because it is behaving differently, institutions have to consider it,” said Wood.

Whereas they have trillions of dollars under management,” said Wood. “And so we think there will be a lot of incremental demand, and to satisfy a lot of that demand. Someone’s going to have to sell,” she continued. Institutional appetite for Bitcoin Wood’s statement indicates a wider trend among institutional investors which are just now discovering the advantages of holding Bitcoin. Back in May, Matrixport analysts found that unlike previous bull markets, the rally that raised BTC to a new all-time high of $111,814 was mostly driven by institutional demand, instead of the retail investors. This means that more institutional investors such as major companies and financial management firms are crowding the market now more than ever before. In fact, at least 61 corporate treasuries currently hold a combined 3.2% of the total BTC supply according to Standard Chartered’s Bitcoin report. Most recently, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet announced its plans to acquire 210,000 BTC by 2027, aiming to own 1% of the total supply of global BTC. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s Strategy remains the largest corporate holder of BTC, possessing 580,955 BTC as of June 9, holding around 2.7% of the total Bitcoin supply. As previously reported by crypto.news, ARK Invest recently upped its Bitcoin price forecast in the firm’s April report to $2.4 million by 2030 if its on-chain financial services grow at a 60% annual rate.

According to data from crypto.news, Internet Computer ( ICP ) rose 8% to an intraday high of $5.66, pushing its market capitalization above $3 billion. The token is now trading 32% above its year-to-date low. Today’s gains, supported by a notable increase in daily trading volume, came as the broader cryptocurrency market slumped , with total market capitalization falling 2.2% to $3.4 trillion over the past 24 hours. ICP’s recent rally was driven by excitement around Caffeine , an AI-powered development platform from the Dfinity Foundation, which recently opened for alpha access. The Dfinity Foundation supports the development of the Internet Computer Protocol. In the live demonstration at the World Computer Summit in Zurich on June 5, founder Dominic Williams revealed that Caffeine will enable users to create blockchain applications in real time on ICP through natural language conversations, removing the need for traditional programming skills. The platform leverages ICP’s secure smart canister architecture and aims to democratize blockchain development, making it accessible to a global user base via smartphones. As of press time, the alpha version is currently open for waitlist registration, with a public beta launch expected within the next month.

Such whale accumulation typically triggers FOMO among retail investors, who follow suit, often leading to further appreciation in the asset’s price due to increased demand.

ICP price, 50-day SMA chart — June 9 | Source: crypto.news It’s also moved above the upper boundary of a descending channel pattern, adding to signs of a bullish reversal. ICP is trading above its 50-day simple moving average, which further supports the bullish case. On top of that, both the MACD and RSI are pointing up, which shows buyers are stepping in and momentum is picking up. ICP MACD and RSI chart — June 9 | Source: crypto.news Based on this setup, the next likely target is around $6.88, which lines up with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. If it breaks above that, bulls may aim for the next major resistance at $8.53, the 38.2% retracement level, about 51% higher than current prices. However, if ICP drops below the key psychological support at $5, it could slide further down to the next major support around $4.20.

According to a June 8 announcement , the program will provide financial support through a combination of original tokens and USDC equivalents, depending on the type of asset lost. Affected users must connect their impacted wallet to the official grant interface, review their specific compensation offer, and sign a confirmation message to accept the terms and conditions. Alex Protocol was exploited on June 6, targeting several liquidity pools on the platform. Alex Protocol confirmed that the attacker exploited a vulnerability in its self-listing verification logic, allowing them to drain approximately 8.4 million STX, 21.85 sBTC, 149,850 aUSD, and 2.8 aBTC, resulting in total losses exceeding $8.3 million. Alex Lab has not yet published a technical post-mortem report, but one community member speculates that the issue may stem from a “Stacks limitation.” I was wrong with my initial assessment of this hack – I didn't understand fully how ALEX contract was meant to work.

Notifications and claim instructions were sent to affected addresses by June 8. The reimbursement structure includes full USDC compensation for STX holdings at a fixed exchange rate of 0.68 USDC per STX.

For aUSD losses, 91% will be returned in aUSD, and 9% will be returned in USDC at parity. Support payments will be distributed to eligible Ethereum addresses by June 17. Users must accept the grants by a deadline that will be communicated via official channels. This is the second major exploit targeting Alex Protocol. Last year, the platform suffered a $4.3 million breach linked to its cross-chain bridge infrastructure. At the time, developers suspected the involvement of the North Korean hacker group Lazarus. ALEX Lab initially offered a 10% bounty for the return of 90% of the assets, but the offer was later withdrawn without explanation.

The plan could change how crypto ETFs are designed and tracked in the U.S., and the crypto community is calling it a “power move” that may drive more institutional interest. However, despite growing excitement around ETFs, the SEC has yet to approve any new applications, leaving some doubts about whether multiple ETF approvals will happen by the end of the year. MEGA BLAST! The SEC just unlocked a new era in crypto. The Nasdaq Crypto Index (NCIUS) now officially includes $XRP , ADA, SOL & XLM — alongside the OGs BTC & ETH This isn’t just an update — it’s a power move toward full-scale institutional adoption. pic.twitter.com/UWeweBCfEX — XRP Governor (@xrpgovernor) June 8, 2025 XRP, SOL, ADA, XLM Join the Index On June 2, Nasdaq submitted a Rule 19b-4 filing to the SEC to expand the benchmark for the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF (NCIQ). The proposed change would replace the current two-asset benchmark, focused only on Bitcoin and Ethereum, with the more inclusive Nasdaq Crypto Index (NCI). The NCI now includes nine major cryptocurrencies , mainly Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Stellar Lumens (XLM), Chainlink (LINK), Litecoin (LTC), and Uniswap (UNI). With this, Nasdaq is aiming to offer a more complete snapshot of the digital asset landscape. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Meme Coin ETFs To Be Launched By 2026, Says Senior Bloomberg Analyst , ETF Still Limited to BTC and ETH, for Now Although the benchmark has expanded, the Hashdex ETF is still legally restricted to holding only BTC and ETH due to current SEC regulations. This creates what’s known as a tracking error; the ETF follows a broader index but doesn’t yet reflect all its assets. To manage this gap, Hashdex uses a sampling strategy to approximate the index’s performance without fully matching it. The SEC has until November 2, 2025, to approve or reject Nasdaq’s proposal. If approved, it could open the door for the ETF to invest directly in all nine NCI assets, offering greater exposure to altcoins and potentially boosting investor confidence in regulated crypto investment vehicles. This move comes amid rising institutional interest in diversified crypto products. Nasdaq’s filing signals a significant step toward broader regulatory acceptance and ETF evolution, one that could bring XRP, SOL, ADA, and XLM closer to mainstream U.S. investment platforms. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Yes, including more altcoins in regulated ETFs could offer institutions diversified, regulated crypto exposure, potentially increasing their interest and shaping future portfolio strategies. What are the long-term benefits of including altcoins like XLM or UNI in a regulated ETF? Long-term benefits include greater market legitimacy, increased liquidity, diversified investment opportunities for traditional investors, and potentially more stable price discovery for these altcoins. Is there a strategic advantage to early ETF exposure before altcoin inclusion is approved? Early exposure to the current BTC/ETH-only ETF might offer a strategic advantage if investors believe the price reflects future altcoin inclusion, potentially capturing upside once the broader index is approved.",News|Crypto ETF,EN,0,0,ADA|MARKET|SOL|XLM|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-09 07:24:47

One name drawing serious buzz in the DeFi market is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new cryptocurrency currently priced at just $0.03, with analysts predicting it could surge to $3 in 2025, delivering potential 100x returns. MUTM’s support comes from more than 11,700 investors who have contributed $10.2 million during the ongoing presale. Investors taking part in the Mutuum Finance Phase 5 presale will see their investment doubled to $0.06 when the token is launched in exchanges.

Mutuum Finance In Phase 5 of its Presale The fifth phase of Mutuum Finance presale has started as the platform attracts increasing investor interest.

The country appears to have insufficient stimulus measures to boost domestic consumption, according to Zhiwei Zhang, President at Pinpoint Asset Management . The result is a fourth consecutive decline amid trump trade wars since the beginning of the year. China’s median estimate, as polled by analysts, showed a 0.2% decline, considering price wars in the automotive industry, which added significantly to the downward pressure. The CPI dramatically dropped in February with a 0.7% decline and continued to fall by 0.1% in March and April. China’s CPI index falls for the fourth time this year In May, wholesale prices fell by 3.3%, marking the highest drop since July 2023 and a steep drop compared to the 3.2% analysts’ estimate from LSEG data. According to Wind information, the core inflation rate that excludes food and energy prices jumped by 0.6% in May, marking the highest since January this year. However, wholesale prices have remained in deflation since October 2022. China May CPI m/m -0.2%, y/y -0.1%. Stats bureau: core CPI m/m +0.1%, y/y +0.6% so not worse than before. True. It's bad headline CPI, but not necessarily worse than last month. （統計侷說得看核心CPI。那你倒是做張核心通脹的圖一起放出來嘛。先謝謝統計局了。） pic.twitter.com/yIWlHd1hMH — Liqian Ren (@liqian_ren) June 9, 2025 Zhiwei Zhang, President at Pinpoint Asset Management, revealed that the price war in the automotive industry has played a major role in keeping consumer prices weak. He added that falling property prices contributed to the downward pressure despite exports holding strong. He argued that the country will eventually depend on domestic consumer demand to fight deflation. Policymakers have urged the automotive industry to end price wars, which are affecting businesses’ profitability and sustainability. The automotive sector ministry wrote on the official WeChat account that there are no winners in price wars, let alone the future. The ministry committed to collaborating with law enforcement agencies to combat unfair competition and vowed to protect consumers. The ministry will take regulatory measures to promote high-quality industry development. Coal mining, oil, and gas extraction firms experienced the biggest drop in prices, with 18.2% and 17.3% drops, respectively. Lijua Dong, NBS Chief Statistician, stressed the need for forceful and targeted stimulus measures to improve consumption. China Securities Journal wrote that the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) may drop the Required Reserve Ratio (RRR) further this year to enhance growth and could end the pause on government bond trading. The Central Bank of China paused bond purchases in January to curb weakening currency and dropping bond yields. Trump tariffs hit China’s consumer prices by a 0.1% drop in May U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which rose to 145%, prompted China’s top financial regulators to unveil policies to boost the country’s economy. China’s Central Bank reduced key interest rates by 10 basis points and lowered the reserve requirement ratio, determining the amount of cash banks must hold by 50 basis points. He Lifeng, the Chinese Vice Premier and lead trade representative, is expected to meet with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in London today for renewed trade talks. Both countries struck a deal on May 12 in Geneva, Switzerland, that led both sides to drop tariffs. According to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the U.S. reduced tariffs on Chinese goods to 51.1%, while China dropped levies on American imports to 32.6%. Trump accused China of violating the Geneva agreement by taking time to approve the export of additional minerals to the U.S.; at the same time, China blamed the U.S. decision to impose new restrictions on Chinese Student visas and further export restrictions. China’s Ministry of Commerce recently said it will proceed to review and approve the export of rare earth metals due to the massive demand from Robotics and the new electric vehicle sectors.

Current SEC restrictions prevent Hashdex’s ETF from holding XRP, though a rule change decision is pending. XRP price faces short-term bearish pressure, with key resistance at $2.30 and downside risk toward $2.14. XRP has joined the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, a move that could further open the door to institutional exposure and reshape liquidity across key markets. On June 6, asset manager Hashdex updated its Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), outlining changes to its benchmark. According to the filing, Nasdaq expanded the index on June 2 to include XRP, alongside Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Stellar Lumens (XLM). Previously, the index was limited to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Hashdex’s NCIQ ETF Tracks This Index Hashdex’s ETF, which trades under the ticker NCIQ, tracks this index, providing market-cap weighted exposure to BTC and ETH within a regulated framework. However, current SEC restrictions prevent the ETF from holding any digital assets beyond BTC and ETH, a limitation that may introduce tracking risk now that XRP and others are included in the benchmark. “Under current regulatory restrictions, the Trust is only permitted to hold bitcoin and ether, and is not permitted to hold the new index constituents,” the filing states. “As such, the risk of potential tracking error is increased.” Separately, Nasdaq submitted a proposed rule change in March that would allow the ETF to track the broader Nasdaq Crypto Index (NCI), which already includes XRP, SOL, ADA, XLM, Chainlink (LINK), Litecoin (LTC), and Uniswap (UNI). XRP was officially added to the NCI on June 3, 2024. Should the SEC approve Nasdaq’s rule change, Hashdex’s ETF would be able to hold all NCI constituents — a potential game-changer for XRP’s institutional footprint. A final SEC decision is expected by November 2. Bears Pressure XRP Despite Nasdaq Index Inclusion XRP is trading near $2.22 after a volatile weekend, with technical signals pointing toward bearish momentum in the short term. On the 2-hour chart, XRP faced strong resistance around $2.30 and failed to sustain upward momentum, retreating to the lower Bollinger Band at $2.14. RSI stands at 51.52, indicating neutral momentum but leaning toward overbought after recent rallies. The MACD remains flat, signaling indecision among traders. On the 30-minute chart, XRP shows a sharper downward trend. RSI is at 34.32, approaching oversold territory, while the MACD remains negative, reinforcing near-term bearish pressure. The price has struggled to stay above the $2.25 support, suggesting sellers remain in control. The 1-minute chart confirms short-term weakness, with RSI falling to 32.74 and MACD in negative territory. Buyers are failing to generate sustained volume, with recent bounces quickly sold off. Despite XRP’s inclusion in the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, institutional flows have yet to lift price action meaningfully. Unless XRP reclaims $2.30 with strong volume, further downside toward $2.14 remains likely. Traders should monitor broader market sentiment and upcoming SEC decisions that could affect institutional access to XRP-based products.

Trump has called for Homeland Security to “liberate Los Angeles from the Migrant riots.” Trump, posting on Truth Social on June 8, coined the situation as an “invasion” and blamed “Illegal Aliens and Criminals” for what he described as violent attacks on federal agents. The president announced that he had directed Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Attorney General Pam Bondi to take “all such action necessary” to end the violence and “liberate Los Angeles from the Migrant Invasion.” “ Order will be restored, the Illegals will be expelled, and Los Angeles will be set free. Thank you for your attention to this matter! ” he wrote. VP Vance shared the president’s message on X, telling Americans that “the president will not tolerate rioting and violence.” 🇺🇸🇺🇸 https://t.co/cvOsEb45MH — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 9, 2025 Elon Musk then quoted Vance’s remarks with two American flag emojis, alongside comments from internet personality Jeffery Mead, who claimed Los Angeles lawmakers have failed to support federal immigration enforcement. “ ICE needs help. Enforce the law, with or without local help ,” he surmised. Protests extend after National Guard deployment What began as a few hundred demonstrators gathering in downtown Los Angeles on Friday, turned into chaos by Sunday. Protesters have lit police vehicles on fire, and riot police with the National Guard were deployed in full gear and clashed with crowds. Late Saturday, Washington sent a new federal directive to ICE mandating them to arrest at least 3,000 undocumented migrants per day. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has accused the Trump administration of instigating the violence. “ What we’re seeing in our city is chaos provoked by the Trump Administration ,” Bass wrote in a citywide newsletter on Sunday addressed to residents under the banner “Dear Angeleno.” She reiterated that the city had not requested federal military assistance. Yet, President Trump deployed 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles over the weekend. It is the first time since 1967 that a president had sent federal troops to a US city without a formal request from the state governor. Governor Newsom condemns Federal Troop involvement Yesterday evening, California Governor Gavin Newsom said President Trump’s decision has “unlawfully deployed” federal troops, and blamed the administration for violating state sovereignty. In a public statement on X, Newsom demanded that federal troops be withdrawn immediately. “ We didn’t have a problem until Trump got involved ,” the governor noted. “ This is a serious breach of state sovereignty, inflaming tensions while pulling resources from where they’re actually needed .” Responding to the governor on Truth Social, Trump lashed out at both Governor Newsom and Mayor Bass, blaming them for the breakdown in public order. “ Governor Gavin Newscum and ‘Mayor’ Bass should apologize to the people of Los Angeles for the absolutely horrible job that they have done, ” he beckoned. pic.twitter.com/1keU3EnfnH — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 9, 2025 The president referred to the demonstrators as “troublemakers and insurrectionists,” and criticized California’s handling of wildfires and permitting delays. He also banned the use of masks during protests, asking: “What do these people have to hide, and why???” “ Great job by the National Guard in Los Angeles after two days of violence, clashes, and unrest. These Radical Left protests… will NOT BE TOLERATED ,” the POTUS said, praising the National Guard. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Announced Monday, the XRP issuer will offer a grant funding of up to $200,000 per project over the next year. The program is a part of the XRPL Japan and Korea Fund and Ripple’s broader 1 billion XRP commitment. “The funding will be awarded to a select group of early-stage startups based in Japan that are building on the XRPL,” Ripple noted. This includes firms working on use cases such as decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenized real-world assets (RWA), among others. The grants will be awarded to startups based on their “growth potential, technological sophistication, and alignment with Ripple’s investment priorities.” Additionally, startups will gain access to Ripple’s global partner network and experts, the digital asset firm added.

Ripple calls the initiative more of a multi-stakeholder platform. It brings together diverse groups to address the gap between traditional financial systems and Web3 innovation. Further, the initiative comprises of four major events across Japan through 2026. These gatherings aim to boost Web3 innovation, policy alignment, and investor engagement through pitch competitions, policy panels, and investor networking. Ripple Initiative Fosters Japan’s XRP Boom Early this year, Japan’s banking sector validated XRP, signalling a turning point for institutional adoption. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) confirmed that by the end of 2025, every bank in the country will adopt XRP for payments. Besides, Ripple head Brad Garlinghouse said last year that the company is in the process of launching a stablecoin in Japan soon, subject to regulatory approval and licensing.

Unilabs’ unique AI-backed DeFi asset management platform sparks presale demand; Dogecoin prepares for a rebound, while Cardano tumbles 10%. Table of Contents Experts see Dogecoin soaring high Cardano tumbled 10% in the past week Unilabs Finance: The first AI-backed DeFi asset manager Closing thoughts Despite the bold Dogecoin forecasts and the soaring Cardano price, Unilabs Finance is in the spotlight. Popular for its novelty, the pioneering AI-backed DeFi asset manager is among the new DeFi protocols to watch out for this year. At the heart of the ecosystem will be the UNIL token, currently in presale and selling out fast. Over $2.2 million has been raised in early funding, priced at $0.062 in the third ICO stage. Hailed as a future top 100 coin, it is a strong contender against DOGE and ADA . Experts see Dogecoin soaring high Despite the recent downturn in the Dogecoin price, 15% in the past week, the 9-HMA and Williams Percent Range (14) suggest a rebound. At $0.18, a retest of $0.20 could push DOGE above its 30-day high of $0.25. Additionally, a new all-time high isn’t out of the question. Down over 70% from the 2021 ATH of $0.73, the current Dogecoin price presents a great entry, positioning it among the leading tokens to buy. While Hcpxbt targets a rally between $0.50 and $0.60 in its next leg up, many top analysts predict a jump above last cycle’s peak. ProTheDoge, popular for their bullish stance, believes the Dogecoin price could climb past $2 this year. Although one of the top tokens to buy in this bull run, experts consider UNIL more attractive due to its AI narrative and higher growth prospects. Cardano tumbled 10% in the past week Like many top altcoins, the Cardano price is in a downtrend. It nosedived by 10% on the 7-day chart, trading at $0.6. However, its long-term outlook remains promising, especially considering growing adoption and institutional interest. At the same time, technical indicators point to a bounce in the Cardano price, the Williams Percent Range and Stochastic RSI Fast are key signals. Its next jump could push the price above the monthly high of $0.8608, positioning it among the top DeFi tokens to buy. Meanwhile, its long-term outlook is even more promising. Despite recent market downswings, Crypto_Twittier is optimistic, predicting a range between $3.80 and $5.60 this year, a bold Cardano price prediction. However, experts believe its upside pales in comparison to Unilabs’ UNIL token, considered a more compelling alternative. You might also like: DOGE to rebound soon; Unilabs emerges as a stronger alternative to ADA Unilabs Finance: The first AI-backed DeFi asset manager Unilabs Finance (UNIL) is a new DeFi protocol that intersects with traditional finance and artificial intelligence. Fundamentally solid, experts believe it could be the year’s breakout project. Also, its native utility coin, UNIL, is considered a strong contender against ADA and DOGE, one of the leading DeFi tokens to buy this cycle. A hot topic within the crypto community is its novelty, which revolves around being the first AI-backed DeFi asset manager in the world. Designed to democratize access to alpha and unlock institutional-grade opportunities for everyday retail investors, it intends to level the playing field for small-scale investors. With its utility coin, UNIL, currently in presale, it has been selling out quickly. A token costs only $0.0062 in the third stage of the ICO, with early investors positioned for significant gain during the presale and post-launch. Other perks to holding include staking, periodic airdrops, exclusive access to high-potential opportunities, voting rights and redistribution of 30% of the total platform-generated fees to holders. Closing thoughts In its early stages, UNIL is one of the leading DeFi tokens to buy due to its upside potential and budget-friendliness. Presenting a lower entry than the current Dogecoin price, investors don’t have to break the bank before positioning for gains. Despite experts’ bold Cardano price prediction, its small market cap leaves plenty of room to run. To learn more about Unilabs Finance, visit the website and Telegram.

Analyst Spots Bullish Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-to-4-22-analyst-spots-bullish-inverse-head-and-shoulders-pattern/,"Crypto analyst CoinsKid has drawn attention to a prominent inverse head and shoulders pattern emerging on the daily XRP/USDT chart. The formation, which consists of a left shoulder, head, and right shoulder, is traditionally interpreted as a bullish reversal signal in technical analysis when it forms after a sustained downtrend. CoinsKid noted that he has been monitoring this macro pattern for some time, citing its recent interaction with key resistance levels. Rejection at the Neckline Aligned with Expectations The neckline resistance, identified on the chart at approximately $2.60, has proven to be a significant obstacle. As per CoinsKid’s commentary, he anticipated the recent rejection at this level, aligning with historical resistance behavior that often follows the completion of the right shoulder in this pattern. The chart, taken from TradingView, clearly marks the left shoulder around March, the head in April near the $1.61 level, and the right shoulder forming in late May. CoinsKid emphasized that the “invalidation of this macro reversal pattern is the head,” underscoring the importance of the $1.61 support zone. A breakdown below this level would negate the pattern and shift the technical outlook bearish. However, as long as XRP continues to hold above this region, the pattern remains valid. Invalidation of this macro reversal pattern is the head. I have been tracking this for a while. That's why I expected a rejection at the neckline resistance. #xrp hold the HEAD!! and take out the neckline and we should see the technical target at $4.22 met. pic.twitter.com/JV5oGA8jcq — CoinsKid (@Coins_Kid) June 6, 2025 Measured Move Points to $4.22 Technical Target He said, “That’s why I expected a rejection at the neckline resistance,” pointing out that the consolidation below this line is consistent with the technical structure’s usual behavior. The analyst concluded his post with a clear target if the pattern confirms: “#xrp hold the HEAD!! and take out the neckline and we should see the technical target at $4.22 met.” The $4.22 price level, drawn vertically from the head to the neckline and then projected upward from the breakout point, represents the measured move of the pattern. This target implies a nearly 94% price increase from the neckline, should XRP successfully break and close above $2.60 on significant volume. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Possible Upside Momentum Toward Late June In response to a question from another user, ElliotHODLs, who asked whether the next significant move could occur toward the end of June, CoinsKid replied , “It’s should be moving up by then yes.” This suggests that he expects bullish momentum to resume within the next few weeks, potentially aligning with broader technical and market confluence. Key Support and Resistance Levels to Watch While CoinsKid’s analysis is rooted in classical charting methods, the successful execution of this pattern would require XRP to maintain the head level and breach the neckline with sustained buying pressure. As of now, XRP is trading at $2.17, approximately 17% below the neckline. The chart indicates that the structure remains intact, but the coming sessions will be critical for confirming the direction. This outlook highlights the significance of the $1.61 support and $2.60 resistance levels. Traders closely watching XRP will likely view this pattern as a key technical signal, provided market conditions remain favorable and volume supports the potential breakout.

To extend this model to institutional clients, it recently obtained a $2 billion credit line from prominent Asian conglomerates.

Through its CeDeFi protocol, Avalon also offers yield-generating savings products. Users can deposit FBTC, a 1:1 Bitcoin-pegged asset, and borrow Tether ( USDT ) at fixed rates, funds that are deployed into high-yield strategies via platforms like Ethena Labs ( ENA ). Avalon operates across 20+ public blockchains and 50+ isolated lending markets, with total value locked exceeding $1.1 billion, as per DefiLlama data . The burn follows several major developments for Avalon Labs. On May 26, YZi Labs, formerly Binance Labs, announced an undisclosed investment in Avalon, boosting the project’s institutional backing. And in February, the firm revealed it was exploring a Bitcoin-backed public debt fund under Securities and Exchange Commission oversight, a step that could bring more traditional investors into the crypto credit market.

Investors are holding back across the board as they wait for a high-level trade meeting between the United States and China taking place in London today. The stall comes at the start of a week packed with economic events and fresh inflation data. According to CNBC , the tension in markets is tied directly to what traders expect—or don’t expect—to come out of this sit-down. By early morning, the 10-year Treasury yield dipped by 1 basis point to 4.50%. The 2-year Treasury yield dropped 3 basis points to 4.01%, and the 30-year yield stayed locked at 4.97%. In the bond market, yields and prices move in opposite directions. A basis point is 0.01%, and even small moves like these matter when markets are this sensitive. Asian markets climbed during overnight trading hours, as investors tracked the upcoming U.S.-China meeting while processing China’s latest trade and inflation figures. In the U.S., equity futures reflected none of that optimism. S&P 500 futures pulled back about 0.1%, Nasdaq 100 futures slid 0.2%, and Dow Jones futures fell 45 points, or 0.1%. Those declines followed two strong weeks for all three indexes. S&P 500 sits near record, but traders remain cautious Last week, all three major indexes ended higher for the second week in a row. The S&P 500 broke above 6,000 for the first time since February 21, now sitting less than 3% away from its all-time closing high. But instead of pushing further, traders are pausing. Chris Verrone, chief market strategist at Strategas, spoke on CNBC’s Closing Bell Friday about the shift. “The message of the market is still one that is largely pretty constructive here,” Chris said , pointing to the S&P 500’s recent three-month high. He added that cyclical stocks continue to perform better than defensive sectors, despite weaker economic data. “I know the data on balance has been softer, but the market’s saying ignore it. Cyclicals making new highs versus defensives says, ‘Hey, the economy’s largely OK here.’” Meanwhile across the pond, futures data from IG suggests London’s FTSE will open 7 points higher at 8,836, Germany’s DAX up 3 points at 24,296, France’s CAC 40 up 5 points at 7,801 and Italy’s FTSE MIB 13 points higher at 40,595. Inflation numbers and apple conference crowd the week Meanwhile, the rest of the week is loaded with major events. On Monday, Apple launches its 2025 Worldwide Developers Conference. Apple’s stock is down more than 18% since the start of the year, and analysts will be watching closely to see if the company brings anything to revive investor interest. Midweek, the consumer price index (CPI) will be released on Wednesday, followed by the producer price index (PPI) on Friday. Both data sets will offer insight into how current tariff levels might be impacting prices across the economy. On top of that, consumer sentiment numbers from the University of Michigan also drop Friday, and they’ll include information on inflation expectations. Gold prices were mostly flat Monday morning. Spot gold nudged up 0.1%, reaching $3,313.54 an ounce as of 0543 GMT, while U.S. gold futures slipped 0.4% to $3,333.80. Market watchers say investors are holding off from major trades until the London meeting gives some direction. On the technical side, gold may test support at $3,296, and if that level breaks, it could fall as low as $3,262, based on analysis from Wang Tao, a Reuters technical analyst. Bitcoin didn’t do much either. It held above $105,000, gaining just 0.1% over the past 24 hours to trade at $105,616 by press time. Like everything else in the market today, it’s just waiting.

That would make Tether the 19th largest company in the world, ahead of giants Costco and Coca-Cola. Ardoino acknowledged that the figure was impressive, but said the estimate was “a bit cautious” given Tether’s growing Bitcoin and gold reserves. Tether’s IPO valuation is driven by the current market cap of Circle, one of its largest competitors in the industry, at $30 billion. According to internal financial models, Circle will reach $410 billion in EBITDA in 2025, which is priced at a 69.3 multiple. Related News: Whale Activity Indicator at Its Peak in On-Chain Data - Here Are the Altcoins They Are Trading Tether, which announced a net profit of $13 billion for 2024, is reported to have earned $7 billion of this profit from Treasury bonds and repo transactions. The remaining $5 billion in profit consists of unrealized gains on Bitcoin and gold assets; these gains are not included in EBITDA calculations. Over the next year, Tether is expected to increase its USDT supply by another $50 billion to $60 billion, and will operate with an average USDT supply of $170 billion. With an average Fed interest rate of 4.2%, this would translate into EBITDA of around $7.4 billion in 2025. Based on Circle’s valuation multiple, this EBITDA figure could give Tether a market cap of $515 billion. *This is not investment advice.

Priced currently at just $0.005, the project’s momentum is being fueled by a compelling blend of advanced AI technology, a clear vision for decentralized data infrastructure, and investor demand for high-upside opportunities. As more retail and institutional investors take notice, several factors have contributed to this early milestone—and possibly signal even more explosive growth ahead. 1. Advanced AI-Powered Infrastructure The core value proposition of Ozak AI lies in its powerful predictive engine. Unlike traditional analytics platforms, Ozak AI integrates advanced machine learning models into customizable Prediction Agents (PAs) that help users analyze real-time financial and blockchain data. These agents adapt and evolve based on market behavior, giving traders and investors a unique edge. The promise of real-time, actionable insights driven by AI is resonating strongly in a data-driven investment world, helping attract both tech-savvy users and speculative capital. Youtube embed: Next 500X AI Altcoin 2. Decentralized Network Model for Trust and Security Another driving force behind Ozak AI’s rising presale success is its robust decentralized architecture. Through the Ozak Stream Network (OSN) and DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) integration, the platform ensures that data is stored and processed securely—without central points of failure. As blockchain communities grow increasingly concerned about centralized control, this decentralized model has been a powerful appeal, especially among DeFi and Web3 advocates. 3. Ultra-Low Entry Price with 300x Potential With a Ozak AI presale entry point of $0.003, Ozak AI presents a rare opportunity to invest in a low-cap token with massive upside potential. Analysts and early adopters are already forecasting a potential surge to $1 or beyond—equivalent to nearly 200x–300x returns. This price-performance speculation, combined with a real product under development, has fueled a fear of missing out (FOMO) among early investors and crypto influencers. 4. Growing Institutional and Whale Interest Large wallet activity, including participation from Ethereum and Solana holders, has added legitimacy to Ozak AI’s early growth. The $1 million raised isn’t just from retail investors—it includes early contributions from known crypto whales and blockchain-focused venture capital entities. Their backing sends a strong signal to the broader market that Ozak AI may be a long-term project rather than a short-term meme play. 5. Momentum from the Broader AI Narrative Artificial Intelligence remains one of the hottest themes in both tech and crypto sectors. Ozak AI is riding this wave by positioning itself not just as another AI coin, but as a serious infrastructure project with decentralized data, secure analytics, and scalable solutions. As interest in AI continues to rise globally, projects that merge blockchain and AI—like Ozak AI—are becoming prime candidates for explosive growth. Ozak AI’s $1 million presale success isn’t accidental—it’s the result of strategic positioning, strong utility, and impeccable timing. As investors hunt for the next 100x or even 300x altcoin, Ozak AI’s fundamentals and momentum make it one of the most promising candidates in 2025. If its roadmap continues to deliver, the $0.003 presale price may one day seem like a historic bargain. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based crypto project that provides a technology platform that specializes in predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized network technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to help crypto enthusiasts and businesses make the correct decisions.

Real Trades. Real Results. In a market that moves by the second, Cortextrade.io offers more than just automation – it delivers an edge. By giving users access to advanced crypto trading bots powered by artificial intelligence, the platform turns volatility into opportunity and data into profit. What Is Cortextrade.io? Cortex Trade is a next-generation algorithmic trading platform built for both crypto newcomers and seasoned traders looking for smarter, more efficient ways to grow their capital. It uses state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning techniques to execute trades automatically, eliminating emotion and guesswork. These bots don’t just follow price trends – they learn, adapt, and evolve. How the AI Bots Work Cortextrade’s core strength lies in its ensemble AI model – a powerful combination of multiple deep learning architectures, including: – TCN (Temporal Convolutional Networks) for sequence modeling – CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) for pattern recognition in price charts – LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for capturing long-term dependencies in time series data – XGBoost for high-performance predictive modeling – K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for clustering assets by volatility – Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for identifying profitable market regimes These models work together to analyze 15-minute candlestick data across 1000+ days, identifying complex market patterns in ETH/USDT and beyond. The ensemble approach resulted in a 983+% ROI in backtesting, a staggering number that highlights the bot’s potential – though not a guaranteed outcome. What Data the AI Uses Cortextrade’s AI doesn’t just rely on charts. It pulls from a broad spectrum of real-time and historical data: – Price action and technical indicators – News sentiment analysis using NLP to monitor global headlines – Blockchain analytics, including smart contract behavior – Wallet tracking, especially for crypto whales and institutional players This multi-layered data pipeline gives the bots a comprehensive view of the market – from macro events to micro wallet movements. Real Performance, Real Markets While backtests show promise, Cortextrade’s bots have also proven themselves in live test environments. Starting with as little as $20 per trade and scaling to $100,000 in capital, the bots were able to generate consistent profits over a 7-day real market test – with disciplined risk management and no over-optimization. Built by Traders, Refined by Data The development of Cortextrade.io is the result of years of research and real trading experience. From early rule-based strategies using RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands to today’s deep learning-driven ensemble system, the journey has been marked by relentless iteration and a refusal to settle. Every improvement, every model tweak, and every performance gain was built on the core belief: smart algorithms, used with patience and discipline, can compound wealth over time. Final Word Cortextrade isn’t hype. It’s a system built on research, powered by AI, and tested in the real world. Whether you’re just entering the world of crypto or looking to supercharge your existing strategy with advanced automation — this is your edge. Start smarter. Trade better. Cortextrade.

Fueled by growing institutional adoption and bold long-term forecasts, the pathway to this price target hinges on a seemingly simple, yet monumental, shift: Wall Street allocating a significant slice of its vast wealth to the number one digital asset. Wall Street is the Game-Changer At the recent Bitcoin 2025 event, Strategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor emphatically stated: “When Wall Street is 10% Bitcoin, Bitcoin will be $1,000,000 a coin.” According to him, this level of allocation would equate to as much as $20 trillion flowing into BTC markets, making a hostile takeover economically impossible as aggressive buying would only empower existing holders. The Bitcoin maxi isn’t alone in his mega-bullish outlook. Blockstream CEO Adam Back believes BTC could achieve the $1 million target way before Wall Street accumulates 10% of the cryptocurrency. He suggested that even a widespread 2% allocation across major asset managers like BlackRock would be enough to push Bitcoin’s price to that level. It is not the first time Saylor has predicted BTC’s price hitting seven figures. In a September 2024 interview with CNBC, he forecasted a long-term price for the king cryptocurrency of $13 million, calling it “perfect money” in contrast to fiat currencies, which he labeled “pseudoscience.” Other prominent voices such as former Binance chief Changpeng Zhao, popularly known as CZ, have echoed similar sentiment. The crypto entrepreneur previously projected BTC could end up anywhere between $500,000 and $2 million in this cycle. Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest is another entity sharing the optimism. In April, the firm revised its base case target for BTC to $1.2 million by 2030, with a bullish estimate of $2.4 million. ARK attributed the potential surge to institutional adoption, especially via spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as well as Bitcoin’s growing role as a decentralized, programmable store of value. In the company’s estimation, all bets would be off if BTC manages to capture at least 6.5% of the projected $200 trillion global investable assets market. This would dwarf gold’s current share at roughly 3.6%, a comparison backed by data that Bitcoin enthusiast and early stage angel investor Fred Krueger recently shared , showing that more Americans now own Bitcoin (49.6 million) than gold (36.7 million), with significantly higher average holdings. Price Performance Meanwhile, BTC’s price action reflects a market digesting its recent surge to a new all-time high of $111,814. At the time of this writing, the asset was trading at $105,466, after oscillating between $105,112 and $106,365 in the last 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, it gained a modest 0.6% to outperform the broader crypto market, which dipped 0.8% in that period. Zooming out some more, BTC’s current price is a 2.1% improvement over the last month, while on a yearly basis, it has soared 52.2%, highlighting a long-term uptrend with brief pullbacks.

Over the past week, HYPE has risen over 5% and has seen a 20% spike in trading volume over hints that Binance listing may be underway. BitMEX Co-founder Arthur Hayes Fuels HYPE HYPE got even more attention when BitME co-founder Arthus Hayes in a recent X post tagged Binance founder CZ, asking when HYPE would be available for spot trading. This comes after Binance’s social media channels hinted at supporting HYPE. Hey @cz_binance does this mean Binance is about to list $HYPE spot soon? https://t.co/e7Qk1RGtJ0 — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) June 9, 2025 BinanceUS listed HYPE perpetual contracts with up to 75x leverage on May 30 but hasn’t announced a spot listing yet, despite strong demand. Binance clarified that futures listings don’t guarantee spot listings. But still, Arthur Hayes’ post and the futures listing have fueled hype around a possible spot debut, with Hayes even predicting HYPE could hit $100 soon. Binance had also recently teased that the spot trading for Hyperliquid is coming soon. Who Will List It First? Kraken, Binance US, and Coinbase are all in line to list it in the U.S. Binance listed HYPE futures just after Coinbase, so the first to list spot could quickly be followed by others. Hyperliquid has gained traction for offering smooth perpetual futures and spot trading, especially after handling huge leveraged trades from crypto trader James Wynn. Its total value locked has doubled in recent months, showing strong growth and user interest. However, despite James Wynn boosting the DEX with huge bets, he criticized its weak referral program compared to other platforms. He also said that his partnership proposal was ignored, but it made sense for a decentralized platform. He urged Binance’s CZ to build a “dark pool” DEX to challenge Hyperliquid. This is to help traders avoid liquidations caused by DEXs being too transparent and open to manipulation. “CZ has the money, network, teams to build something like no other. Look at what he’s done with Binance. I hope this encourages HyperLiquid to level up as they’ll soon be outweighed by better competition,” he said. HYPE Tests Key Levels After a strong rally to $38.16, HYPE is now cooling off and trading around $35.01. It is stuck just below a key resistance at $35.91, based on Fibonacci levels. If HYPE breaks above $35.91, it could regain bullish momentum. The next resistance is near $38, and if that is cleared, a new all-time high could be on the horizon. On the flip side, if it fails to break above $35.91, it could drop further to support levels around $34.32 or $33.42. Further, if the price falls below $30.75, it could mark the end of the current uptrend and could lead to a bigger drop towards $22.92.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-09 08:10:20

Was this genuine tension , or a carefully timed shakeup? The debate is on. Some see it as a market reset, designed to scare off weak hands. Others feel it’s just chaos as usual. But for those paying close attention, moments like this are where new opportunities begin. Crypto Markets Shudder as Two Power Players Go Head-to-Head Volatility Spikes, But a Few Investors Spot the Pattern The Musk-Trump fallout didn’t just stay on social media. It triggered a wave of panic in markets, especially crypto. While most ran for cover, a handful of investors stayed calm , and looked deeper. They saw beyond the red charts. Some believe this is more than a feud , it could be an intentional move to reset sentiment and prepare for bigger plays ahead. Whatever the truth, it sparked a wave of exits , and quietly, a wave of entries. Because while most were watching the drama, some were watching a new name rise. In the Shadows of a Sell-Off, One Meme Coin Begins to Rise Investors Are Asking: What’s This Frog-Based Token That’s Gaining Attention?

According to a June 5 resolution , the agency concluded that Milei acted in a personal capacity when he posted about the LIBRA token on his X account and did not violate federal ethics laws applicable to public officials. Authorities noted that no public resources were used and that his account, active since 2015, is used primarily for political and personal expression, not official communication. The Anti-Corruption Office further stated that Milei was exercising his civil and political rights under Argentina’s constitution. While his posts may reference government matters, they do not reflect institutional positions unless issued through official channels, it added. Milei remains under scrutiny The resolution has effectively ended the administrative ethics probe into Milei’s role in the incident that began earlier this year. However, a separate criminal investigation remains ongoing. A federal court continues to examine potential violations of securities laws and allegations of market manipulation. This includes probing whether Milei and his associates had prior knowledge of LIBRA’s price trajectory and insider activities surrounding the token’s launch. Federal judge María Romilda Servini has taken charge of the criminal investigation. A scheduled hearing on May 18 saw no appearance from Milei or his sister Karina, who serves as Secretary General of the Presidency. Servini has since requested that the Central Bank provide banking records for both siblings dating back to 2023. What is the LIBRA meme coin scandal? The LIBRA memecoin was introduced on February 14 as part of a blockchain initiative branded “Viva La Libertad” by Delaware-based firm Kelsier Ventures. That same day, President Milei posted support for the token, describing it as a tool to boost economic growth and aid Argentine startups through blockchain-driven private investment. He also shared LIBRA’s contract address publicly. LIBRA rallied over 3,000% within minutes , reaching a market capitalisation of more than $4 billion upon the President’s endorsement. However, the rally was short-lived. Developers and insiders, allegedly controlling around 70% to 85% of the token’s supply, began selling at peak prices, triggering a collapse of over 90% within hours. Investor losses have been estimated between $100 million and $280 million . Following public backlash, Milei deleted the posts and denied any formal involvement with the project. At the time, he claimed his remarks were made in good faith to promote innovation, not as an endorsement for investment. Nevertheless, critics have argued that Milei used his office to fuel speculative hype around the token. Argentina’s Chamber of Deputies responded by approving a formal investigation into the LIBRA scandal on April 8. Lawmakers passed three resolutions, including the establishment of a commission to probe the incident, summons for key cabinet members, and a request for documents from the executive branch.

Several firms already filed for Dogecoin, TRUMP, and Bonk ETFs, but recent price declines and lowered prediction market odds means that sentiment is cooling. Meanwhile, major ETF issuers are pressuring the SEC to return to a first-to-file approval model. Across the Atlantic, the UK’s FCA recently proposed lifting its ban on crypto ETNs for retail investors. Meme Coin ETF Momentum Builds The possibility of the first actively managed meme coin-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) launching in the United States is gaining traction, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. In a June 7 post on X , Balchunas said there is a ”really good chance” that such a fund could emerge, likely in 2026. He expects a wave of active crypto ETFs to arrive first, which will pave the way for more niche products like a dedicated meme coin ETF. This type of fund will differ from traditional passive ETFs by dynamically adjusting its portfolio by holding outperforming tokens while selling off underperformers. His comments were made in response to a post from the Vladcoin team , a Russia-themed meme coin project, which advocated for a performance-based ETF structure tailored to meme coins. The explosive growth in meme coin trading pushed the sector’s market capitalization above $60 billion this year, and could drive ETF issuers to capitalize on the trend. One major hurdle remains regulatory. Balchunas pointed out that meme coins will likely need to be excluded from the scope of the 1933 Securities Act before being eligible for inclusion in such ETFs. The outcome of pending applications for a spot Dogecoin ETF, which was submitted by firms like Grayscale, Bitwise, and 21Shares, could serve as an important signal. Additionally, Osprey Funds and Rex Shares have also submitted applications to the SEC for Dogecoin, Official Trump (TRUMP), and Bonk (BONK) ETFs earlier this year. However, market sentiment around meme coins has cooled since its peak in January. Most of the top meme coins experienced big price drops. In fact, Dogecoin is down 75%, Shiba Inu has lost 85%, Pepe fell almost 60%, and TRUMP is still 86% below its all-time high. DOGE ETF approval odds (Source: Polymarket ) Prediction markets like Polymarket also lowered the odds of a Dogecoin ETF being approved this year from 75% to 44%, reflecting the ongoing regulatory uncertainty. While enthusiasm for meme coin ETFs is still high, the road ahead is still full of volatility and unanswered questions. ETF Issuers Push SEC to Honor First-to-File Rule A group of major ETF issuers, including VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital, urged the US SEC to return to the “first-to-file” principle when approving ETF applications. In a joint letter , the firms criticized the SEC’s current practice of bundling decisions and prioritizing later applications. They argued that it undermines competition and deters innovation in the financial sector. Historically, the first-to-file approach was the standard procedure for processing ETF applications, but the SEC shifted away from this model during the wave of crypto-related ETF filings. The letter mentioned that delaying or disregarding early applications discourages pioneering companies from developing new investment products, which could lead to reduced investor choice and inefficiencies in the market. The issuers warned that this approach weakens the SEC’s own mandate to protect investors and foster capital formation. They also stressed that the global financial leadership of the United States is tightly linked to having regulatory frameworks that actively encourage entrepreneurship and innovation in financial products, especially in emerging sectors like digital assets. The appeal to the SEC was made after a sharp increase in digital asset ETF filings, particularly after the election of President Donald Trump. This influx of applications includes altcoin ETFs and staking-related funds, which proves that there is growing institutional interest in broadening exposure to the crypto market. Despite this momentum, the SEC repeatedly delayed its responses to several high-profile filings. In May, it extended its decision deadline on Grayscale’s spot Solana Trust ETF to October and likewise postponed verdicts on proposed staking and XRP-based ETFs. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart pointed out that delays are typical under the 19b-4 filing process, with the SEC usually taking the full allotted time before issuing a decision. The Commission also raised concerns over the REX-Osprey staked ETFs, and questioned whether their business structure meets the requirements for ETF classification. These developments have stalled launches that many believed were imminent, and raised even more questions about how and when the SEC will greenlight the next wave of crypto investment products. Crypto ETNs Could Soon Be Open to UK Investors Meanwhile, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) proposed lifting its existing ban on cryptocurrency exchange-traded notes (ETNs) for retail investors. This will be a huge shift in the country’s approach to digital asset regulation. Announced on June 6, the FCA's proposal will allow individual consumers to access crypto ETNs—so long as they are listed on a recognized investment exchange within the UK. The regulator stated that it plans to strike a better balance between investor protection and financial freedom. “We want to rebalance our approach to risk,” said David Geale, executive director of payments and digital assets at the FCA. “Lifting the ban would allow people to make the choice on whether such a high-risk investment is right for them, given they could lose all their money.” FCA announcement People in the industry welcomed the move as a positive development for the UK’s financial innovation goals. Diego Ballon Ossio, a partner at law firm Clifford Chance, explained that the proposal aligns with the UK’s ambition to be a leader in crypto finance. He added that allowing access to ETNs will not only offer new investment opportunities but also signal that the UK is embracing the digital asset economy. Kraken’s UK General Manager, Bivu Das, also applauded the FCA’s shift by stating that it is a key milestone that reflects the maturation of the market. Ian Taylor of CryptoUK and HT Digital believes that the change could enhance consumer protections while still enabling exposure to crypto. This move comes as the FCA is working on updating its crypto regulatory framework. In May, the regulator asked for public input on new stablecoin and custody rules. Meanwhile, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves announced intentions to establish a comprehensive regime that will position the UK as a global crypto hub. The urgency of these regulatory updates is heightened by reports showing the UK now leads globally in crypto adoption, outpacing even the United States.

While DOGE remains a fan favorite and one of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap, most analysts agree that such massive gains are unlikely to repeat as the token matures and volatility levels out. That has led many retail and DeFi-focused investors wondering what’s the best crypto to buy now for outsized returns. One such new cryptocurrency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly gaining traction as the next big crypto with viral potential and projected 44x upside. The official presale of Mutuum Finance has priced the token at $0.03 in Phase 5, closer to a Phase 6 price of $0.035 per MUTM. Already having achieved a 200% growth from when it was first launched in presale, MUTM will officially go live at $0.06, giving current customers a minimum 100% return on investment (2x ROI). Presale Picks Up Speed: Mutuum Finance Takes the Lead Mutuum Finance continues to gather momentum as Phase 4 of its presale sold out ahead of schedule. In Phase 5 currently, tokens are set at $0.03, giving investors a 16.67% return right off the bat once the price increases in the next round. The presale has already raised over $10.2 million and attracted more than 11,700 investors. With demand on the rise and sound fundamentals, most are hoping for even greater returns after launch, as MUTM makes a case for itself as among the top altcoins to invest in 2025. Innovative Buy-and-Distribute Model Unlike traditional speculative token models Mutuum Finance is different for relying on a Buy-and-Distribute mechanism. It regularly buys MUTM tokens on the open market and rewards stakers with them which keeps tokens out of circulation encourages long-term investing and helps maintain a healthy growth of the token price. Early Investors Reward With greater growth Mutuum Finance doesn’t forget its early supporters and continues rewarding them. From the investors 10 will be chosen to share a $100,000 giveaway each getting $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens for cheering the project in the beginning. Stablecoin Launch & Certik Audit Build Investor Trust Mutuum Finance is releasing a dollar-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum. Compared to unbacked algorithmic stablecoins, Mutuum’s stablecoin is properly collateralized, so it maintains a constant price and user trust. The smart contracts of the platform have been extensively audited by Certik, a name as renowned in blockchain security as it gets. This finished audit further strengthens the platform’s preference for transparency, security, and long-term sustainability. The Buy-and-Distribute system, robust security of its coin and recognized audit credentials all make Mutuum Finance an interesting combination of progress, proven safety and active community involvement. For bold investors, it allows them to support a DeFi project as it is starting out in the field. Over $10.2 million has already been raised, and more than 11,700 investors have joined the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale—clear signs of growing momentum. At a current presale price of $0.03, and a confirmed launch price of $0.06, early participants are guaranteed a 2x return before the token even hits exchanges. Analysts see the potential for 44x to 100x gains, driven by a strong utility model, the Buy-and-Distribute reward system, a fully collateralized stablecoin, and a successful Certik audit that reinforces investor trust. Act now to claim your share of the next major DeFi success, buy MUTM tokens before prices rise again.

Strong jobs report reduces chances of rate cuts at June and July FOMC meetings. Trade policy uncertainty adds complexity to Fed’s interest rate decisions in 2025. Crypto markets are on high alert for the May U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on June 11, a high-stakes data release that will test the market’s waning hopes for a near-term Federal Reserve rate cut. The inflation figures arrive just days after stronger-than-expected jobs data significantly dampened expectations for monetary easing in the first half of the year. This CPI print is now a critical pivot point that could either bolster the Fed’s argument for keeping rates “higher for longer” or provide the first concrete evidence that inflation is cooling enough to justify a cut later in the year. Strong Jobs Report Tempers Rate Cut Expectations According to MarketWatch , analysts expect the May CPI to register a 0.2% month-over-month increase and a 2.5% year-over-year increase. The Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is projected to come in at 0.3% MoM and 2.9% YoY.

By 2028, DOGE may potentially achieve a peak price of $1.06. By 2031, DOGE might touch $1.72 with an average trading price of $1.65. Propelled by a dedicated community of part-time developers and enthusiastic internet supporters, Dogecoin is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Despite relying on borrowed code due to limited resources, its popularity continues to soar, with tens of thousands of social media followers advocating for supply limitations. Having touched its ATH at $0.7376, will DOGE reach $1? Let’s get into the Dogecoin price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Dogecoin Token DOGE Price $ 0.1814 (-0.97%) Market Cap $27.19B Trading Volume (24-hour) $747.62M Circulating Supply 149.61B DOGE All-time High $0.7376 May 07, 2021 All-time Low $0.00008547 May 07, 2015 24-hour High $0.1864 24-hour Low $0.1808 Dogecoin price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 8.88% 50-Day SMA 0.203048 14-Day RSI 40.19 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 62 (Greed) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA 0.202816 Dogecoin price analysis: DOGE faces minor bearish pressure as it drops toward $0.18 TL;DR Breakdown : Dogecoin price analysis confirmed a downtrend as the price declined toward $0.18. Cryptocurrency loses 0.97% of its value. DOGE coin prices seek support at $0.1788. On June 9, 2025, Dogecoin price analysis revealed a decreasing trend for the meme coin. The coin value has corrected further to $0.18 in the past 24 hours. From an overall observation, the currency went through a loss of almost one percent in the day. However, buyers were quick to prevent further declines, resulting a rebound. Dogecoin 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of Dogecoin confirmed a downward trend in the market. The cryptocurrency value has stepped down to $0.18 in the day. Red candlesticks on the price chart signify persistent selling pressure. However, buyers are now aiming for a rebound. DOGE /USD shows increasing volatility The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is widening, leading to increasing volatility. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $0.2476, whereas its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.1624. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present within the neutral area. The indicator’s value has decreased to index 39.28 in the past 24 hours. The descending curve on the RSI graph signifies a rising bearish strength. If the selling activities continue to accelerate, further loss is also possible. DOGE/USD 4-hour price analysis The four-hour price chart of Dogecoin also confirmed a downward trend in the market. DOGE/USD value has further dipped to $0.1815 in the past few hours. The decreasing volatility signals a lower chance of a trend reversal and lesser price oscillation in the coming hours. However, buyers are now pushing the DOGE price above $0.182. DOGE /USD 4-hour price chart The Bollinger Bands are converging, leading to decreasing volatility. This decrease in volatility signifies a lower market unpredictability. Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger band has shifted to $0.1886, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band has moved to $0.1767, securing the support. The RSI indicator is plummeting but within the neutral region. Its value has deteriorated to index 43.33 in the past four hours. This decrease is represented by a downward RSI curve. The bears maintained control during the day, leading to a significant decline. A further downturn is possible given the bearish progression.

Dogecoin price analysis gives out a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. Coin value has deteriorated to a low of $0.1814 in the past 24 hours. However, a rebound above EMA20 trend line might send the DOGE price toward a retest of $0.185 level. On the other hand, a continuous bearish pressure might plunge the DOGE price below $0.18. As a result, the meme coin might head toward the crucial support line at $0.162. Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is highly volatile and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.615 level by 2026. Why is DOGE down? DOGE’s price decreased to $0.18 over the last 24 hours as bearish momentum continued around immediate support channels. Moreover, sellers are currently dominating the price action. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2025? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.329854 in 2025. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by June 2027. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support for this meme coin can push it to $1 by 2028. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 2,276.57 DOGE in June; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is trading below the year’s peak price of $0.414, which was observed on January 17, 2025, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.72 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial. Recent news/opinion on Dogecoin The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed its decision on crypto exchange-traded funds linked to Dogecoin.

Dogecoin historic price sentiment DOGE price history 2013 was the beginning of Dogecoin, and it surged to $0.0004 in the first days of trading. By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March’s bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February. In March, DOGE’s value decreased further as it dipped to the $0.20 range, and April saw the lowest DOGE price of $0.142. However, in May, the meme coin recovered back to the $0.249 mark, following some improvement. Near the start of June 2025, Dogecoin is trending near the $0.20 level.",Crypto Price Predictions|DOGE,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|MINING|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-09 09:30:39

Kwok posted, “@easya_app just added $5 BILLION to $XRP market cap.” The bold claim was met with a follow-up question from X user Kurt Kickass, who asked , “How? What does your app do? How did it add 5 billion? That’s impressive.” In response , Kwok pointed to a “huge inflow of new developers building on the XRP Ledger via EasyA.” @easya_app just added $5 BILLION to $XRP market cap pic.twitter.com/1knwhwL5xk — Dom (Bull/ish) | EasyA (@dom_kwok) June 8, 2025 Hackathon Projects Showcase XRPL Use Cases Kwok’s comments were tied to developer activity seen during a recent event organized by EasyA in collaboration with Ripple. The event, the EasyA x Ripple Singapore Hackathon, featured various projects built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). A post from EasyA’s official X account shared additional details, showcasing what it described as early signs of serious developer interest translating into real-world applications that leverage XRPL’s capabilities. The post described several of the most prominent projects launched during the hackathon. One such project, New Era, enables users to deposit RLUSD (Ripple’s new stablecoin) and earn yield, presenting an on-chain interest-bearing product built directly on XRPL. Another project, XRPL Asset Manager, is designed for institutional use, offering a streamlined way for large asset managers to tokenize assets on the XRP Ledger. According to EasyA, this tool aims to attract traditional finance institutions seeking to enter the tokenization space with lower operational friction. Applications Target Payments, Tokenization, and Lending TokenPass was presented as a platform for businesses and creators to implement token gating, where exclusive content or services can be accessed only by holders of specific tokens on the XRPL . This model has increasingly gained traction in Web3 content and experience monetization. Wave Tip, another project developed during the event, focuses on helping creators, particularly on platforms like Twitch, retain more of their income through microtransactions powered by the XRP Ledger’s low-fee architecture. Further emphasizing financial services use cases, Kazi Pay allows freelancers to receive payments in XRP or RLUSD, potentially improving access to faster, cheaper cross-border earnings. CrowdLift introduces a new way for startups to raise capital by issuing tokens directly on the XRPL. This could lower entry barriers to early-stage funding, a common challenge in the startup ecosystem. Meanwhile, MicroLoan X is built to facilitate small, low-fee personal loans on the XRP Ledger, which may appeal to users in underserved or emerging markets.

While the precise causal relationship between these new developments and market capitalization growth is difficult to quantify directly, Kwok’s statement implies that developer momentum is translating into increased demand and confidence in the network. EasyA has positioned itself as a key driver of blockchain education, and its efforts to onboard developers to various ecosystems , especially through hackathons and structured challenges, have previously drawn attention in other blockchain communities. Its partnership with Ripple in Singapore reflects a focused attempt to expand the scope of real-world applications being built on XRPL, beyond just token transfers.

In a June 6 post on X, Armstrong admitted that addressing the problem had become a “top priority” and invited affected users to contact Coinbase Support directly. “For longer than is acceptable, account freezes have been a major issue,” Armstrong said . “We’ve now reduced this by 82%, with more improvements coming.” AI Drives Drop in Coinbase Account Freezes The substantial progress comes after Coinbase brought in Dor Levi, a product team member, nine weeks ago with a dedicated mission to fix the problem. Levi revealed that the team made “significant investments” in improving the company’s machine learning models and infrastructure to enhance accuracy and reduce false triggers that led to account restrictions. “We’ve improved the precision and recall of our models, and as a result, there are fewer freezes,” Levi explained. While Coinbase will continue to freeze accounts when legally required—such as due to court orders or sanctions—Levi acknowledged that the overall user experience still falls short. “As a Coinbase customer myself, it doesn’t yet meet my own bar,” he said. Despite the improvements, some users remain frustrated. One reported being locked out of their account for over two years, while another said they left Coinbase entirely after an eight-month freeze. A third blamed the poor customer service experience, citing long wait times and difficulty speaking to live support staff. Security Concerns Still Linger After Breach The timing of this update comes as Coinbase attempts to restore user confidence following a mass data breach that compromised over 70,000 customer accounts . In that incident, malicious actors bribed overseas customer service contractors to access sensitive personal information, including government-issued IDs and home addresses. Although the breach occurred in December, it was only publicly disclosed in May. One X user even claimed their family friend lost Bitcoin and Ether due to a scam linked to the stolen data. Coinbase, which serves over 100 million users and is the largest custodian of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., has committed to reinforcing its security protocols. But for now, reducing account freezes is seen as a major step toward regaining trust among its global user base.

After correcting from its May highs near $176, the SOL price seems to have found a strong demand zone between $147 and $150, a level that has been acting as a base for bullish reversals. The on-chain activity remains healthy despite the broader market consolidation, and the technicals flash an early sign of strength. With momentum rebuilding and bulls defending key levels, has the stage been set for a breakout towards higher resistance zones? The SOL price recently formed a double-bottom pattern near $147, confirming strong buyer interest at this level. These levels also align with the zone that has repeatedly absorbed downside pressure. Hence, as long as this base holds good, the short-term structure remains bullish. Now the question arises, will the SOL price rise above $160 in June 2025? The chart patterns and the technicals suggest the formation of a bullish cup & handle pattern, both in the short term and long term. After a parabolic recovery, the token is about to validate the formation of a cup & handle pattern, with the neckline being around $177 to $181. Such formations often signal a trend continuation and typically resolve in favour of bulls when confirmed with rising volume. Meanwhile, the momentum indicators point towards a bullish thesis as the RSI triggers a rebound from the lower threshold and the MACD is about to undergo a bullish crossover with a drop in the selling pressure. Therefore, the Solana price is expected to maintain a consolidated ascending trend and reach the local highs above $165. Here, the token may experience some bearish action, which could be for a short time, as a strong rebound to the neckline could be imminent.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-09 09:43:35

As the dust settles from the latest wave of phishing attacks, breaches, and increasing regulatory pressure, one thing is becoming abundantly clear: the era of centralized custody in crypto is reaching an inflection point. Coinbase may still stand tall as the poster child of exchange-driven adoption, but its growing vulnerabilities expose a systemic flaw. Users are still being asked to trust a third party with their assets, privacy, and safety. In a post-Coinbase world, this trust model is no longer sustainable. You might also like: Rethinking money in the web3 era: From capital to code, narrative, and moral design | Opinion The next chapter of crypto centers around non-custodial infrastructure—models that return control to the user without sacrificing security, usability, or speed. The “not your keys, not your coins” ethos is evolving from a rallying cry into an architectural blueprint for the next generation of crypto platforms. The trust crisis and its ripple effects Recent events, such as the estimated $300 million in phishing-related losses on Coinbase , as highlighted by investigators like ZachXBT, indicate that centralized platforms are being pushed to serve as banks, tech firms, and compliance officers all at once. But in doing so, they inherit the worst vulnerabilities of each model. The trust users place in these intermediaries becomes a single point of failure, exploited not just by hackers but by misaligned incentives and opaque systems. We are now seeing users, especially the next wave of adopters, demanding platforms that work like Coinbase, but without the custody. They want seamless on/off ramps, intuitive UI, and fast swaps—but without giving up sovereignty over their funds. What a post-Coinbase model looks like Most so-called “non-custodial” platforms still expect users to jump through hoops just to do the basics. Meanwhile, centralized giants like Coinbase built empires by prioritizing ease of use over core crypto principles. That tradeoff is no longer acceptable. The real opportunity now is to build platforms that don’t ask users to choose between control and convenience. Crypto should be as simple as swapping tokens in seconds. No logins, no account creation, no handing over your identity to a black box. Most fiat on-ramps still funnel users through third parties that operate like banks in disguise. The future is wallet-native, not broker-driven. We need KYC and payments infrastructure that supports sovereignty, not platforms that treat users like liabilities to be monetized. And let’s kill the fantasy that users are going to “bridge,” “wrap,” and “unwrap” every time they move across chains. No one has time for that. Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), and Cosmos Hub ( ATOM ), they should all work from one interface, no jargon, no jumping through tabs. If your product still requires a tutorial, it’s not ready for mass adoption. Lastly, security can’t mean telling people “don’t forget your seed phrase” and calling it a day. That’s lazy. Non-custodial platforms must bake in real protection—recovery options, phishing defense, smart defaults, without turning every user into their own IT department. To get there, the tooling layer must evolve. Non-custodial platforms can’t just mimic Coinbase’s front end; they need an entirely different backend philosophy. That means embedded wallets that users don’t have to manually manage, programmable permissions that can restrict risky transactions, and cryptographic recovery mechanisms that don’t rely on centralized email resets or paper backups. This is not about dumbing down crypto; it’s about abstracting the complexity without obscuring the control. Technical breakthroughs exist, from threshold signatures and stealth addresses to social recovery, but they need to be productized in a way that puts real power in users’ hands without overwhelming them. Equally important is shifting the narrative from fear-based adoption to empowerment. Centralized platforms preyed on users’ uncertainty: “Let us handle it, it’s too complicated.” The next wave will win by saying, “You’ve got this, and we’ve got your back.” That mindset shift will define which wallets, dApps, and protocols earn user loyalty in the post-Coinbase era. Crypto’s first decade was built on the backs of early adopters willing to navigate clunky interfaces, obscure terminology, and high-friction workflows. But the next billion users won’t tolerate that. They expect web3 to meet the standards set by their favorite apps. This means fast, clean, intuitive, and secure by design. The infrastructure that powers non-custodial finance must learn from the best of web2, without importing its exploitative models. That means prioritizing UX alongside protocol design, and treating users not as endpoints, but as co-owners of the network. We cannot afford to be rebranding the old playbook anymore. The real shift is happening—in tools that feel as seamless as Coinbase, but don’t ask you to hand over your keys, your data, or your trust.

The community debates how many dReps should be involved in the summit. A Cardano dRep criticized in-person meetings as elitist, but Hoskinson pushed back. A proposal by Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson for a post-budget summit has ignited a fierce community debate, exposing deep-seated tensions over inclusivity, elitism, and the future of the project’s decentralized governance. Hoskinson posted the idea on X, asking if it would be prudent to hold a summit to review the 2025 budget cycle.

With less than a month left before their self-imposed July 4 deadline, they still can’t get on the same page about President Trump’s massive tax-and-spending proposal—his so-called “big, beautiful bill.” According to The Wall Street Journal , Majority Leader John Thune is scrambling to release a new version this week, but nothing’s moving fast, and the internal battles are stacking up like unpaid bills. Trump wants this multitrillion-dollar package done. The House barely passed its version in May by one vote. But now it’s stuck in the Senate, where Republicans are fighting over how to balance the extra debt and the deep spending cuts that would supposedly pay for tax relief, border security, and military upgrades. Some senators want to protect their states from slashed federal programs. Others are pissed the bill doesn’t cut enough. “We are not, I think, resolved as a conference as to what that bill looks like,” said Lisa Murkowski, Republican senator from Alaska. “Everyone is just pulling this Gumby in lots of different directions.” Senators argue over Medicaid, food aid, and tax breaks The revised version hasn’t even dropped yet, and it’s already a battlefield . Republicans hold just a 53–47 lead in the Senate, and the House has a slim 220–212 margin. That means even a handful of holdouts—whether they band together or act alone—can kill the entire thing. And they’re making threats loud and clear. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the House bill would add $2.4 trillion to the deficit over ten years. That’s on top of the already projected $21.4 trillion. To limit the damage, the bill slashes federal spending on healthcare, food programs, and education. Trump still wants his 2017 tax cuts extended, and his new idea of “no tax on tips” included, which means the cuts had to come from somewhere. Tommy Tuberville, Republican from Alabama and a 2026 gubernatorial hopeful, is pissed that states would now have to chip in 5% of the cost of food benefits for poor families. “You can’t overload the states with what’s supposed to be federally funded—we can’t afford it,” he said. Medicaid is another point of chaos. The House version adds stricter eligibility checks and work requirements for low-income adults, starting in 2026. The CBO says those changes would kick 4.8 million people off insurance by 2034. Some Republicans are okay with that. Others aren’t. Susan Collins, Republican senator from Maine, said she’s fine with work rules for those “truly able to work.” But she’s alarmed by the limit on how much states can tax hospitals and other Medicaid providers to pull in matching federal funds. In her words: “I am looking at the way the provider tax would work, and what the impact would be on rural hospitals, which are teetering in my state.” Then there’s the Florida senator, Rick Scott, who doesn’t think the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act was fair in the first place. He said: “This idea that we pay more money for an able-bodied adult than we do for a poor kid, from the federal government, makes no sense. I believe we’re going to change it.” Florida never expanded Medicaid, and he wants the match rate adjusted. Budget hawks dig in while business demands grow Scott isn’t the only one trying to cut deeper. Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, met with Trump last week and still won’t commit to voting yes. “I want to see him succeed; I really don’t want to make his life, his job, more difficult,” he told reporters. “I don’t want to be a negative influence.” Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy is trying to get support for targeting Medicare Advantage insurers who game the system by tacking on fake diagnoses to get bigger payouts. It’s got some backing from Democrats too, but nobody’s sure Republicans want to touch anything related to seniors during an election cycle. Steve Daines, Republican from Montana, drew a hard line: make the tax deduction for business equipment permanent, or he walks. The current House version only allows it through 2029. “It’s a red line for me—I’ll vote against the bill if it’s not made permanent,” he said. Utah’s John Curtis said the House went too far, too fast by slashing clean energy tax credits from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. That cut threatens companies like Fervo Energy, which is building what it claims is the biggest geothermal energy project in the world—right in Utah. His colleague Mike Lee, also from Utah, and several others are furious about a change to the state and local tax (SALT) cap. The House bill bumps it up to $40,000, from the current $10,000. That mostly helps people in blue states like New York and California. If the Senate tries to gut it, things will explode when the bill returns to the House. Nick LaLota, Republican rep from New York, said flat out, “To disrupt the $40,000 negotiated compromise in the House is to put the entire bill in jeopardy.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

His statement comes after he was challenged on X over his recent pro-Bitcoin comments, prompting the former Massachusetts Senate candidate to clarify where he truly stands. The post I’m quoting is about BTC so my comment is. I clearly own a substantial amount of XRP. I’m just not someone who sees the two as mutually exclusive. We will operate in a world of more than one coin. — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) June 9, 2025 More on this below! Bitcoin at $106K? Deaton Calls It the Safer Bet Deaton stirred conversation by stating that Bitcoin is a safer investment at $106,000 than it was at $20,000, a bold stance backed by his macroeconomic outlook. He points to rising debt levels and relentless fiat money printing as key reasons for Bitcoin’s long-term potential. He also cited recent U.S. policy shifts, including the pro-Bitcoin BITCOIN Act and growing institutional and state-level adoption, as signals of a strong bullish trend for the top cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Bonanza: Deaton’s Daring Investment Call Still, Deaton isn’t married to just one narrative. In a recent post, he emphasized that Bitcoin and XRP are not mutually exclusive, stating , “We will function in a realm with multiple coins.” His sentiment echoes that of Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who recently urged XRP holders not to view the Bitcoin community as adversaries. This balanced stance reflects Deaton’s broader view of a multi-chain future, where competition doesn’t overshadow collaboration. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple Launches Japan-Focused Web3 Program Backed by JETRO , From Paycheck Struggles to Crypto Power Move Adding depth to his story, Deaton shared a personal anecdote – just 15 years ago, he lived paycheck to paycheck. Today, he has 80% of his net worth in Bitcoin and is actively involved in real estate deals to increase his BTC holdings, despite already buying at sub-$25,000 prices. While many speculate on aggressive Bitcoin strategies, Deaton draws a firm line: he does not support mortgaging homes to buy BTC – a statement he clarified wasn’t directed at industry figure David Bailey. What Deaton’s Dual Strategy Signals for Crypto Deaton’s approach captures the evolving dynamic of today’s crypto market: one where XRP’s regulatory win, which confirmed it as a non-security, now coexists with Bitcoin’s explosive 150% rise this year, driven by economic uncertainty and legislative momentum like the GENIUS Act . By backing both XRP and Bitcoin, Deaton stands as a bridge between two powerhouse communities, promoting strategic thinking. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The SEC’s decision is pending on whether the Hashdex NCIQ ETF, which tracks this index, will be allowed to align its portfolio with the expanded index. The Nasdaq Crypto Index recently expanded its composition from five to nine digital assets, adding Ripple ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ), Cardano ( ADA ), and Stellar Lumens ( XLM ). Previously, the index included only Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), Litecoin ( LTC ), Chainlink ( LINK ), and Uniswap ( UNI ). The updated index serves as the benchmark for the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF. However, the NCIQ ETF is currently not permitted to hold the newly added assets due to existing SEC rules, which limit it to investing in Bitcoin and Ethereum only. To change this, Nasdaq ISE, LLC filed a proposed rule change with the SEC on March 7. If approved, the ETF would be allowed to align its holdings with the revised index and invest directly in the additional altcoins. The SEC has until Nov. 2 this year to issue a decision. In the meantime, Hashdex is using a sampling strategy, adjusting its allocations to Bitcoin and Ethereum in an effort to reflect the broader index’s performance. However, this workaround introduces tracking error risk, where the ETF’s returns may diverge from those of the index it aims to follow.

New token or super treat?,https://crypto.news/what-is-crypto-treat-fortnite-new-token-or-super-treat/,"Crypto traders have been misled by Fortnite’s latest unveiling of the superpowered dog, Krypto. The search term “crypto treat fortnite” saw a recent breakout on Google trends, with people looking for a Fortnite token that does not exist. According to Google Trends for cryptocurrency, many users have been misspelling Krypto treat Fortnite as “crypto treat Fortnite” when googling the game’s newest dog-themed power-up. Other search terms that pop up due to the spelling error include “Epic Games token” and “what does the crypto treat do in Fortnite?” Despite the spike in curiosity from traders, the “crypto treat Fortnite” is not a new token issued by the third-person shooter survival video game developed by Epic Games. In fact, the treat holds zero monetary value and cannot be exchanged for fiat-currency or digital assets. Spelled correctly with a K instead of a C, Krypto Treat is a new item introduced in the game’s Chapter 6 Season 3 linked to Superman’s superpowered pooch, Krypto. The dog is a superpowered companion that can assist players in quests and combats. Krypto treats are introduced in the game as a new Mythic Hero Item that lets players summon Krypto, Superman’s cosmic canine companion. The similarities in name may have led to users mistaking it for crypto treat Fortnite instead of Krypto treat Fortnite.

Tossing multiple treats in quick succession can decimate enemies and push through enemy cover. Does Fortnite deal in crypto? In the past few years, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney has confirmed multiple times that Fortnite will not integrate cryptocurrency, NFTs, or token-trading mechanics into its gameplay. This means that the game does not currently have a crypto treat Fortnite token. However, there was one incident back in 2019 when the popular video game made headlines when it “accidentally” accepted the cryptocurrency token Monero ( XMR ) at its official merch store, Retail Row. Sweeney claimed that the acceptance that fueled rumors that the game would be accepting crypto payments was a mistake. “We worked with a partner to open a merchandise store, and somewhere along the way Monero payment was enabled,” said Sweeney in an old thread. While Fortnite still has not adopted any web3 technology to this day, Epic Games’ marketplace had announced the launch of its first Non-Fungible Token game on Sept. 15, 2022.

Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas recently expressed optimism about the potential launch of a memecoin exchange-traded fund. His comments came in an X thread, where he responded to an earlier post that suggested a memecoin ETF could be a promising idea. Balchunas explained that the crypto ETF market is expected to see a wave of actively managed funds towards the end of 2025, after which a memecoin focused era is likely to follow in 2026. Really good chance this exists at some point. First we’ll get slew of active crypto ETFs (eta Winter 2025). Active meme coin-only likely 2026 tho. The return dispersion (and lack of sell side coverage) ripe for active. Could produce next star manager. Who knows. https://t.co/9CcEc4xmev — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 7, 2025 He went on to add that the memecoin market performance history makes them “ripe for active management.” While often described across the industry as volatile and lacking utility, Balchunas suggested that the unpredictable and under-analyzed nature of the sector could be leveraged for stronger benefits. You might also like: Dogecoin price prediction: Futures demand and ETF momentum build case for $1 On the regulatory side, Balchunas pointed out that the future of memecoin ETFs hinges largely on how the SEC handles the tokens. He noted that the agency’s decision on the pending Dogecoin ETF filings will influence their future, adding that structuring these funds to trade existing crypto ETFs under established rules like the 1933 Act might make the approval process easier. The recent remarks now put renewed focus on the ongoing wait for the SEC’s response regarding the OG memecoin. Doge ETF approval stalls Over the past months, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has received several applications for spot exchange-traded funds tied to Dogecoin. Bitwise Asset Management was among the first to file with the commission in January, followed by others including 21Shares, Grayscale, and Rex Shares . However, the SEC has continued to delay its decision, leaving the approval process in limbo. The delay has lowered market expectations for approval this year, with Polymarket data now showing only a 44% chance. This number is down from previous highs above 70%, reflecting waning confidence among investors and market watchers. Analysts have noted that the controversial nature of memecoins remains one of the biggest hurdles to an ETF approval. However, with evolving regulations and a fast-growing ecosystem worth over $60 billion in market cap, optimism persists that these ETFs could still have a shot.

The footage doesn’t just echo long-held community beliefs; it substantiates them with clear architecture that positions Ripple and SWIFT as interconnected rails within a single payment ecosystem. The implication is profound: Ripple’s blockchain network, powered by XRP, is not competing with SWIFT ; it is interoperating with it. PaymentSafe: The Bridge Between Legacy and Blockchain At the heart of this revelation is Eastnets’ Paymentsafe, a comprehensive payment hub designed to unify domestic and international payment networks under one seamless interface. More than just a routing system, Paymentsafe serves as a translation engine for disparate financial messaging formats, converting, interpreting, and processing messages from SWIFT MT, ISO 20022, SEPA, and yes, Ripple. LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! WE ALWAYS SAID #RIPPLE IS CONNECTED TO SWIFT NOW WE HAVE SO MANY FACTS!!! NEVER ARGUE TO NAYSAYERS! FOCUS ON POSITIVITY AND TRUST IN YOURSELF #XRP pic.twitter.com/uquoU8znD1 — Lord XRP (@Bitforcoinz) June 8, 2025 The video shows Paymentsafe’s architecture with various payment protocols connected to its central processing core. On one side lies Ripple, clearly labeled and depicted as an inbound and outbound connection. On the opposite end sits SWIFT, tied to the same processing and formatting infrastructure. The shared rails are managed by a “Universal Translator”, Paymentsafe’s proprietary component that standardizes messaging across platforms. This critical feature enables compatibility between traditional systems and distributed ledger technologies, such as Ripple. This architectural reality leaves no ambiguity: if Ripple connects to Paymentsafe, and SWIFT connects to Paymentsafe, then Ripple and SWIFT are functionally interoperable. Paymentsafe serves as the bridge. XRP and SWIFT: Now Connected via Shared Infrastructure This development upends the outdated narrative that Ripple and SWIFT are adversaries locked in a zero-sum competition. Instead, it validates a new paradigm: Ripple and SWIFT can coexist within shared infrastructure. Paymentsafe is not merely a payment processor; it’s an orchestrator that facilitates real-time transactions across multiple messaging rails, from legacy MT messages to blockchain-powered payment flows. Ripple’s inclusion in this architecture positions XRP not just as a speculative asset or settlement tool, but as a valid rail in institutional-grade financial systems. This is further strengthened by Ripple’s long-standing ISO 20022 compliance and its global partnerships with over 300 financial institutions. Powered by XRP, RippleNet and ODL are already facilitating fast cross-border transactions, especially in areas where traditional payment infrastructure is lacking. Now, through Paymentsafe, XRP is integrated into the SWIFT network , enhancing its reach without replacing the existing system. Why This Connection Matters The financial world is undergoing a transformation driven by interoperability and real-time processing demands. Successful transformation requires systems to be interoperable and to exchange information smoothly. Paymentsafe does precisely this by acting as a universal translator and transaction conductor. It ensures that a message initiated through RippleNet can be translated and finalized through SWIFT—and vice versa. In practice, this means a payment originating on Ripple’s blockchain can now be routed through a system that speaks SWIFT’s language, reaches SWIFT endpoints, and settles in fiat, while maintaining the benefits of blockchain speed and cost efficiency. XRP, through Ripple’s network, is no longer siloed from traditional financial channels—it is seamlessly integrated with them. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Source Behind the Revelation The clip shared by Lord XRP captures a demonstration of Paymentsafe’s architecture and functionality in words: “If you’ve not heard of Paymentsafe, it’s this payment hub that unifies dealing with all kinds of payment networks, whether domestic, international and of course, SWIFT as well, to allow an enhanced STP mode on all different payments… one of the most important components is the universal translator for the exchange of different payment formats.” This “universal translator” is the linchpin. It does not discriminate between legacy and blockchain—it unites them. As a result, Ripple’s connection to SWIFT is no longer theoretical or aspirational. It is technical, functional, and active. A New Era of Interoperable Payments Ripple’s mission has consistently focused on addressing the pain points of cross-border payments, including delays, high costs, and opacity. By establishing a bridge to SWIFT via Eastnets’ Paymentsafe, Ripple is no longer positioned as an outsider looking in. Instead, it’s a full participant in the global financial network, capable of engaging with both blockchain-native platforms and traditional financial institutions. This proves that the future of finance isn’t about replacing one system with another; it’s about convergence. Ripple’s XRP is now part of that converged infrastructure, with direct access to the corridors that SWIFT has dominated for decades. The Evidence Is Clear For years, skeptics questioned Ripple’s relevance to legacy financial systems, especially SWIFT. Now, the evidence is irrefutable. Thanks to Eastnets Paymentsafe, XRP is integrated into an infrastructure that actively communicates with SWIFT, transforming the old rivalry into a collaborative synergy.

As initially reported by The Reporter Ethiopia, Ethiopia’s Financial Intelligence Service has announced that preparations are underway to regulate virtual currencies, despite their continued illegality under current Ethiopian law. The announcement was made by FIS Director Muluken Amare during a recent meeting of the Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group (ESAAMLG) in Addis Ababa, which brought together financial security officials from across the region to address emerging risks in the financial sector, including those posed by virtual assets. The FIS’s preparedness efforts are being conducted in collaboration with international partners, including the United Nations, Russia, and member states of ESAAMLG. The training focuses on equipping financial investigators and intelligence units with the skills to detect and respond to illegal uses of crypto, such as tax evasion , money laundering , and the financing of terrorism . The regional concern over the misuse of virtual currencies has been a key driver of these efforts. Muluken Yirga, a senior legal advisor to ESAAMLG, who also spoke at the meeting, said that terrorist organizations in the region have been using virtual currencies to bypass traditional financial systems, making it harder for authorities to trace and block illicit transactions. “There are different terrorist organizations operating in our region, including Al-Shabaab, Al-Qaeda, ISIL, and Daesh. These groups are increasingly using virtual currencies to raise and transfer funds,” said Muluken. You might also like: African crypto revolution continues as Ethiopia ranks among global BTC mining leaders While crypto trading is officially banned in Ethiopia, some transactions might still be taking place in the country. However, Amare noted that it cannot be assumed that all transactions involving virtual currencies are criminal unless they are tied to other offenses such as terrorism financing or fraud. “… As crypto technology is still new, some transactions may be occurring. That said, it cannot be assumed that all such transactions are illegal. The official currency of Ethiopia is Birr, and any virtual transactions conducted in other currencies are not authorized. If such transactions are linked to crimes such as terrorism or other illegal activities, investigations will be carried out accordingly.” Whether virtual currencies are eventually legalized or remain banned, the officials made it clear that the country must have mechanisms in place either to regulate them effectively or to enforce existing prohibitions.

The presale phase gives early supporters a chance to evaluate a project’s potential long before it hits major exchanges. Among dozens of contenders, a few projects stand out as strong candidates for the top crypto presale category. BlockDAG currently dominates headlines with its rumours of partnership with the NBA, but SUBBD, Solaxy, and Best Wallet are also showing early signs of substantial impact. Let’s break down what makes these four presales worth close attention. 1. BlockDAG: Redefining Visibility Through Sports Partnerships BlockDAG is not just another presale success story. It is actively reshaping how early-stage crypto projects engage with the world beyond blockchain. With an official partnership with Inter Milan and a teaser hinting at NBA involvement, BlockDAG is aligning itself with global sports entities to generate brand authority and recognition far outside the crypto niche. This approach isn’t only about exposure, it’s about trust. Tapping into international sports ecosystems means BlockDAG is building credibility across mainstream audiences. The numbers show this strategy is working: more than $291 million has been raised so far, with over 22.1 billion coins already sold. Currently in Batch 28, the coin is priced at $0.0262, but a temporary pricing running through June 13 allows buyers to access it at just $0.0018. Since Batch 1, BDAG has seen a return of 2,520%, making it one of the highest-performing entries in the current presale cycle. With solid technical backing and a growing global presence, BlockDAG is not only leading in visibility but it is also setting a new standard for what qualifies as a top crypto presale in 2025. 2. SUBBD: Simplifying Access to the Crypto Economy SUBBD is a rising project that aims to remove the complexity often associated with crypto investing. Its user-first platform integrates effortlessly with existing wallets and exchanges, offering a smoother experience for both beginners and advanced users. This simplicity is part of what’s driving increasing interest in its presale. The platform’s focus is on usability without compromising capability. SUBBD intends to become a bridge for everyday users who may be unfamiliar with crypto, while still catering to the needs of experienced traders. That dual appeal makes it especially promising for long-term adoption. Although still in the earlier stages of its presale, SUBBD is gaining momentum by addressing the real-world barriers many face when entering crypto. Its roadmap includes expanded features, mobile support, and educational tools, all elements that support its growing case as a top crypto presale option in 2025. 3. Solaxy: Building the Secure Foundations of Web3 Security remains one of the most pressing concerns in the blockchain world, and Solaxy is directly addressing that gap. This project centres its value on creating safer, more reliable decentralised applications, backed by a strong development roadmap and community support. Solaxy has made it clear that its mission is to protect users from vulnerabilities that have plagued smart contracts and blockchain platforms in recent years. The project’s architecture includes privacy enhancements, anti-exploit systems, and rigorous smart contract auditing. Its presale may not have made major headlines yet, but Solaxy is quietly gaining the attention of serious backers and developers alike. With a clear vision and commitment to solving technical shortcomings, Solaxy is positioning itself as one of the top crypto presale candidates for those prioritising stability and long-term functionality. 4. Best Wallet: Simplifying Crypto Asset Management for the Masses As crypto adoption continues to accelerate, managing multiple wallets, tokens, and transactions has become a growing challenge. Best Wallet addresses this head-on with a platform designed to centralise and simplify digital asset management. What makes Best Wallet unique is its dedication to user experience. The wallet integrates an intuitive design with enhanced security features, making it easy for users to navigate across different blockchains and assets within one ecosystem. Its goal is to reduce friction and make crypto management accessible for everyone, not just tech-savvy users. Interest in its presale has been steadily increasing as more people recognise the need for this kind of streamlined solution. By focusing on practical tools and a broad user base, Best Wallet is carving out a strong position among 2025’s top crypto presale contenders. Final Outlook As presales continue to shape the early momentum of blockchain projects, a clear trend is emerging. Projects that offer a strong technical base combined with cultural awareness, usability, and problem-solving are the ones attracting both users and capital. BlockDAG leads the way by connecting crypto with global sports brands and executing a record-breaking presale. Meanwhile, SUBBD is working to simplify the crypto experience, Solaxy is advancing security standards, and Best Wallet is aiming to become the go-to management tool for everyday users. Each of these projects represents a different angle of where the space is headed, and together they define what the top crypto presale category looks like in 2025. For anyone researching where real momentum is building, these are the names to keep front and centre.

The surge in activity comes as the company completes the rollout of its upgraded platform, OS2, to expand its services well beyond traditional NFT trading. According to data compiled by Dune Analytics, OpenSea saw 467,322 active users in May 2025, its highest total in nearly two years. The figures were near the levels seen between mid-2022 and early 2023, before the downturn in the NFT market began. OpenSea registered 56,400 daily active users in late May, numbers not recorded since April 2023, after daily user counts had consistently stayed below 25,000 for nearly a year. Analysis shows May activity peaked at 2-year highs According to Dune Analytics charts, OpenSea logged 111,724 users on May 30 alone. This included 87,601 new users and 24,123 returning users. As of early June, 236,091 users had already interacted with the platform, and if the trend continues, the month could surpass May’s totals. OpenSea monthly active users chart. Source: Dune Analytics Despite the spike in user numbers, trading volume on OpenSea remains far below the market’s peak. In May, OpenSea recorded a trade volume of $81 million. This figure pales in comparison to January 2022, when the platform handled over $5 billion in NFT transactions during the height of market euphoria. Still, industry observers believe that the quality of user engagement may be improving, even if dollar volumes are not. The platform has seen a 40% increase in weekly unique collectors since January 2025, according to OpenSea’s Chief Marketing Officer, Adam Hollander. OpenSea rolls out OS2 across 19 blockchains OpenSea’s user growth coincides with the official launch of its upgraded platform, OS2, which exited beta last month. OS2 introduces a cross-chain functionality, supporting full token trading across 19 blockchains. Users on the platform can now trade fungible tokens on Solana alongside NFT minting and multi-chain interactions. According to Hollander, the new system allows collectors to execute various blockchain actions, minting NFTs, swapping gaming tokens, and purchasing memecoins within a single wallet interface. In a recent interview, Hollander explained that OpenSea’s OS2 will consolidate fragmented digital asset experiences into one unified platform. “Users were already juggling half a dozen DApps and bridges, we just streamlined that experience,” he said. Market trends hint at NFT market revival According to data from CryptoSlam, NFT buyer participation grew by 55.08% to 826,992 in May. The number of NFT sellers also rose, reaching 257,017, a gain of 18.12%. However, NFT transactions dropped by nearly 25%, totaling 1.65 million for the month. Ethereum , the dominant chain for NFT sales, maintained its lead with $30.3 million in sales, although the network witnessed a 15.57% decline in the last week of the month. Ethereum’s wash trading volume also increased by 11.33%, hitting $1.8 million. Away from the network figures, Courtyard, a marketplace focused on tokenizing physical trading cards, posted $20.7 million in sales during a single week in April. The surge came against the backdrop of Polygon briefly crossing Ethereum’s numbers in weekly NFT sales. Polygon-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have now surpassed $2 billion in all-time sales volume. Sales volume rose from $16.3 million in November to nearly $20 million in December, followed by $25 million in January 2025, $37 million in February, and continued upward to $62.5 million in March, $71 million in April, and $74.7 million in May.

While tokens like Pepe (PEPE) ride temporary trends and Cardano (ADA) leans on academic credibility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will focus on delivering real financial utility, passive income, and decentralized lending through a platform designed for the next generation of crypto users. With over $10.20 million already raised and more than 11,800 holders onboarded, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gearing up to outpace speculative tokens and slow movers alike. Its future isn’t based on hype—it’s grounded in delivery, transparency, and a utility-first design. From Meme to Mechanism: Moving Beyond Hype Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will not aim to replicate the meme-driven rise of PEPE or the delayed deployment model of Cardano (ADA). Instead, it will introduce a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol where users will participate directly as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. Interest rates on the platform will adjust dynamically based on the real-time utilization of liquidity pools. Borrowers will see increased rates when pool usage is high, while lenders will benefit from proportional yield tied to borrowing activity. This balance of incentives will be structured to support a healthy, sustainable ecosystem—not just a temporary price surge. A Roadmap That Will Deliver Results Unlike projects that promise and delay, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already executed a lot of components of its Phase 1, including the presale launch, CertiK audit, $100K giveaway , and the integration of an AI-powered helpdesk. As it transitions through Phase 2 and beyond, the project will shift focus to smart contract deployment, DApp development, and risk analysis tools. In Phase 3, the team will finalize all components—completing the core contract system, launching a functional demo version, and aligning with key regulatory requirements. Once the presale concludes, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch the live platform, list its token on major exchanges, and activate the MUTM claim process. Institutional partnerships will follow, along with expansion to multiple blockchain networks and the development of advanced platform features. This isn’t speculation—it’s a published, transparent blueprint. Every phase is accounted for, and execution will follow a documented structure that few new tokens can match. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer more than just token access—it will build a path to ongoing passive income. By staking mtTokens, users will be eligible to receive MUTM dividends from protocol revenue. The system will work by directing a portion of platform profits to buy MUTM on the open market, then redistributing those tokens to users who stake mtTokens in the safety module. Lending and Borrowing, Evolved Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will support both pool-based (P2C) and direct (P2P) lending models. In the P2C setup, users will deposit assets into shared liquidity pools and earn variable interest depending on utilization rates. Borrowers will draw funds from these pools by locking up collateral, and the rates will scale according to market demand. In the P2P model, users will set custom loan agreements with one another. This will enable personalized rates and strategies, appealing to users who seek tailored financial arrangements. This dual-model design will give Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a competitive edge by offering both automation and customization under one platform. All user funds will be stored in non-custodial smart contracts. Upon deposit, users will receive mtTokens—tokenized representations of their contributions. These mtTokens will accrue interest in real time and can be redeemed along with the underlying assets at any point, assuming available liquidity. The platform will not hold or move user funds without permission. Full on-chain transparency and control will be standard, which will appeal to users who have grown wary of centralized platforms and opaque custody practices. Borrowing on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will allow users to unlock liquidity without selling their assets. Rather than triggering a taxable event or exiting a long-term position, users will be able to lock assets like ETH or BTC as collateral and borrow stablecoins or other assets to fund new opportunities. No Minimums, No Maximums—Just Flexibility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will not impose strict limits on deposit amounts. Users will be free to deposit as much or as little as they wish, although very small amounts may be impractical due to gas fees. Risk-based caps may apply for certain tokens, but these will serve only to protect protocol integrity—not to restrict user participation. This open model will make it easy for both whales and smaller investors to engage with the platform, democratizing access to decentralized finance. At the current Phase 5 price of just $0.03 per token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a rare window of opportunity. It will offer staking rewards, dynamic interest earnings, and passive dividends—all within a fully decentralized structure. With listings on exchanges, expansion to new blockchains, and institutional support on the way, the upside will not rely on hype—it will come from performance. Unlike PEPE, which relies on fleeting momentum, or Cardano (ADA), which has been slow to translate vision into adoption, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will combine speed, function, and financial opportunity in one clear, audited, and structured platform. Conclusion: The Future Isn’t Speculative—It’s Scheduled Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not guessing its way forward—it is building with precision. Each development phase is clearly laid out, with security, compliance, and user rewards all central to the platform’s design. While others talk about innovation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will implement it—on time, on-chain, and on your terms. Whether you’re looking to lend, borrow, earn passive income, or stake for rewards, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be positioned to support your strategy. This isn’t the next meme. This will be the next benchmark.

Wednesday, June 11: CPI Information Core CPI m/m (0.3%) vs the prediction of 0.2%: Unexpectedly high core inflation might make the USD stronger and put downward pressure on XAU/USD. CPI m/m (0.2% expected against 0.2% actual): Probably neutral for gold, as anticipated. CPI year-over-year (2.5% vs. 2.3% forecast): A hawkish Fed tone and a negative outlook for gold could result from higher inflation. Thursday, June 12: Jobs & PPI Data: Core PPI m/m (0.3% vs. -0.4%): Gold is down, but rate increase bets may be revived by a rebound in producer prices. PPI m/m (0.2% vs -0.5% earlier): A positive PPI bolsters inflation worries and is somewhat pessimistic for gold. Unemployment Claims (241K as opposed to the projected 247K): Reduced claims suggest a robust job market, a bullish USD, and a dismal outlook for gold. Friday, June 13: UoM Information UoM Consumer Sentiment Prelim (52.5 vs. expectation of 52.2): A little better sentiment is bad for gold and indicates economic resiliency.

As of Monday afternoon Asian time, Sui ( SUI ) was trading at $3.20, down about 25% from its peak last month. Its market cap sat at around $10.8 billion, according to data from crypto.news. One of the setbacks weighing on SUI recently was the SEC’s decision to delay its ruling on the proposed Canary SUI ETF, a move that would’ve given investors regulated exposure to the token. While ETF delays are pretty standard in the approval process, they often dent market sentiment, especially in already shaky conditions. SUI has also been under pressure following a major exploit on May 22, when the Cetus Protocol, one of the core DeFi platforms built on the Sui network, was hacked. The incident impacted around $223 million in assets , triggering widespread concerns across the ecosystem. You might also like: Sui DEX Momentum lands $100 million in strategic funding led by OKX Ventures Still, there are signs the worst could be over. Data from DeFiLlama shows that total value locked across Sui-based DEXs jumped 4.8% over the past week. In fact, Sui’s total TVL now stands at $3.05 billion, over 50% higher than early April’s $2 billion figure. Part of this growth is being driven by the surge in Bitcoin-pegged assets on the network. Around 10% of Sui’s TVL is now held in tokens like wBTC, LBTC, and stBTC. On top of that, over $1.1 billion in stablecoins is now circulating in the Sui ecosystem, helping improve liquidity for both developers and traders. Supporting the bullish outlook, SUI’s weighted funding rate has remained positive for nine consecutive days, indicating that traders continue to bet on the upside. Sui price analysis On the technical side, things are starting to look promising. SUI appears to be breaking out of a multi-week falling wedge pattern on the daily chart, often a sign that a reversal might be coming. SUI price, 50-day and 200-day SMA chart — June 9 | Source: crypto.news SUI has also printed a golden cross, with the 50-day simple moving average crossing above the 200-day SMA. This is one of the most widely watched bullish signals in technical analysis and often marks the start of a new uptrend. The last time SUI formed a golden cross was in late 2024, when it was trading around $1.10. That crossover was followed by a massive 380% rally, which took SUI all the way to its all-time high of $5.35. If history repeats itself and bullish momentum builds, SUI could be on track to retest that ATH and maybe even break past it. The next major resistance to watch is around $4.31. A clean break above that level could open the door to a move toward the 161.8% Fibonacci extension at $5.92. That said, technical indicators still need confirmation. The RSI has started trending upward but hasn’t crossed above 50 yet. A move above this threshold would suggest that stronger buying momentum is taking over. SUI RSI chart — June 9 | Source: crypto.news However, the golden cross alone may not be sufficient to sustain a major rally without strong follow-through from buyers. Continued bearish overhang, such as the SEC’s delay of the spot SUI ETF, could also limit upside momentum in the near term. If bulls fail to step in with strong buying volume, SUI’s price could retreat, with $2.33 acting as the key support level to watch on the downside.

Developers selected for the program will have access to a production-ready, high-traffic network that already supports major IPs. The accepted projects will gain exposure through Soneium’s official marketing channels, including blog features, livestream sessions, and AMA events. The incubator also offers financial backing, including one-on-one mentoring and strategic advisory sessions through the Sony Innovation Fund, an official partner of the initiative. There is also $60,000 grant pool available for qualifying projects that integrate the Astar ( ASTR ) token as a utility or payment mechanism, made possible through the partnership with Astar Network . Applications for the program opened on June 9, and winners will be announced in late July, with deployments expected to begin shortly thereafter.

However, following all the drama, tensions seem to be easing. The crypto wallet saga involving Donald Trump’s sons and Gettrumpmemes, the company in charge of the memecoin tied to the president recently took a new turn, when Eric Trump took to social media platform X with a reconciliation post. “I am proud to announce the $TRUMP Meme Coin has aligned with @WorldLibertyFi,” he wrote . Eric’s post came only a few days after the family publicly rallied against the firm for launching a crypto wallet tied to their brand without authorization. At the time, the Trumps accused Gettrumpmeme’s partnership with Magic Eden of having “zero involvement” with their organization, even resorting to l egal action to thwart the initiative. You might also like: Bitcoin leads crypto market slump as Trump and Musk trade punches While he confirmed that the wallet project itself will not move forward, the shift in tone came alongside his announcement that their DeFi venture, World Liberty Financial, will acquire a significant stake in the $TRUMP memecoin. According to him, this symbolizes the duo’s joint “vision for crypto, patriotism, and long-term success.” However, Eric’s announcement has once again sparked criticism around the family’s crypto ventures. Skeptics argue that the majority of the projects involved lack transparency and are riddled with inconsistencies, questioning whether they are primarily driven by personal profit rather than genuine interest in the crypto industry. ""Plans to acquire"". Yes, they warn you before buying, just for them to buy higher afterwards…. Makes sense. Such nice people lol. Another obvious manipulation to grab more cash from retail. Even if it pumps and you have a bag, I would advice ou to take profit as soon as you… — Miles (@Miles__Tweet) June 7, 2025 This sentiment reflects the broader skepticism across the community, with many viewing the ventures as more opportunistic than authentic. Despite the announcement, the $TRUMP token has recorded no notable price movement. At press time, it trades around 77% below its all-time high and is down nearly 30% over the past 30 days.

Bitcoin (BTC) started the day with a marginal increase, trading around $105,490. The flagship currency faced a significant decline last week, plunging to a low of $100,424 before rebounding. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) fell below $2,500 as selling pressure intensified. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is down nearly 1%, trading at around $2,490. Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL) have bucked the bearish trend, up 2.39% and 0.50%. Cardano (ADA) is also marginally up, while Dogecoin (DOGE) is down over 1%, trading around $0.181. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable declines, while Toncoin (TON) and Hedera (HBAR) registered marginal increases. Argentinian Authorities Rule Out Foul Play In President Javier Milei’s Crypto Promo Argentina’s federal anti-corruption authority has ruled out foul play in President Javier Milei’s support of the Libra token. The anti-corruption office stated that Milei’s endorsement of the token was made in a personal capacity and did not use federal resources. The office, which operates under a government ministry, stated that Milei’s promotion of the token did not violate federal ethics laws governing public officials. However, a separate investigation remains ongoing. President Milei had posted about the Libra token minutes after its launch, sending its value soaring. He also called it an endeavor to boost Argentine economic expansion by assisting startups and small enterprises with investments made possible through blockchain technology. However, the buzz around the token was short-lived as the token’s founders, who controlled 70% of the supply, liquidated their holdings. The selloff triggered a massive collapse, causing losses between $100 million and $250 million. House Democrats Concerned About CLARITY Act House Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee held a “minority day” hearing on Friday to discuss a pending crypto market structure bill and concerns about its wide-ranging implications for the US securities markets. The Committee’s Republican majority convened most hearings about the bill. The “minority day” hearing allows Democrats to highlight the perceived flaws of the proposed legislation. Democrat witnesses highlighted concerns about the knock-on effects of such a strategy, with Amanda Fischer, Policy Director at Better Markets stating during testimony that the bill’s “regulatory gaps will not be quarantined to crypto.” Fischer stated that by carving crypto from US securities laws that have existed since the 1930s, the CLARITY Act would incentivize traditional financial institutions to shoehorn functions like capital raising onto blockchain networks to dodge regulation and lower costs. She highlighted comments by Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, who stated, “The cost of running a crypto business is an order of magnitude lower. You don’t have to squint too hard to imagine a world where stocks are on blockchains.” Fischer countered stating, “He doesn't have to pay for customer protection, SEC exams, or SIPC insurance. Of course, it's cheaper.” The panel also flagged the act’s two-tiered system for categorizing crypto assets. The bill classifies most crypto tokens as digital commodities, exempting them from SEC regulation. However, token issuers who want to engage in activities resembling a traditional securities offering can register as “mature blockchain systems” with the SEC, a process with more stringent compliance requirements. Fischer argues that few token issuers will engage with a rigorous compliance process, given the CLARITY Act offers many loopholes for issuers. “Crypto issuers will claim they're DeFi; claim that they're not offering investment contracts; claim that they're collectibles or meme coins; claim that they’re airdrops, or claim that they're subject to the [bill’s] grandfathering provision.” Department Of Justice Files Civil Forfeiture Claim Seeking $7.7M In Crypto The US Department of Justice has filed a civil forfeiture claim for over $7.7 million in crypto laundered by North Korean IT workers who gained employment with companies in the US using fraudulent means. The funds were seized as part of an operation against a North Korean plot to evade sanctions. Authorities had indicted a North Korean Foreign Trade Bank representative, Sim Hyon Sop, in connection with the operation. According to the Department of Justice, North Korean IT workers used fraudulent identities to gain employment with US crypto firms. They then laundered their income through Sim, sending it to the regime in Pyongyang. The forfeiture complaint also states that North Korean IT workers had been deployed in several locations across the world, including China, Russia, and Laos. Sue J. Bai, the head of the DOJ’s National Security Division, stated, “For years, North Korea has exploited global remote IT contracting and cryptocurrency ecosystems to evade U.S. sanctions and bankroll its weapons programs.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has made a muted start to the week, with the price marginally down. Despite subdued price action, BTC has maintained its position above $105,000. However, the flagship cryptocurrency risks a drop below $105,000, with the US-China trade talks setting the tone for the week. The trade talks could become a highly volatile catalyst for BTC and the broader crypto market, with the potential to create sharp price movements. Analysts believe that BTC’s current price action is unstable. Dominick John, an analyst at Kronos Research, stated, “Trading above $105K signals strength, but the structure remains fragile. With the Fear & Greed Index at 55, sentiment has balanced markets in a wait-and-see mode, looking for a macro trigger or confirmation of trend.” Kay Lu, CEO of HashKey Eco Labs believes BTC is trading within a delicate range around key support levels. Investors are also nervous and could sell their holdings at the hint of bearish market developments. However, on-chain data shows that Bitcoin’s price support of above $105,000 has been bolstered by institutions adopting the asset and adding it to their corporate treasuries. Min Jung, an analyst at Presto Research, stated, “BTC has been supported by the ‘BTC for Corporations’ narrative, with more companies following Strategy’s playbook.” BTC’s short-term price action and volatility will be shaped by upcoming macroeconomic events. Volatility will pick up midweek, with the US Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index numbers due to be published. “We could see volatility pick up mid-week … Both CPI and PPI are on the calendar, and any upside surprise in inflation data could weigh on risk assets broadly, including crypto.” These indicators could provide insights into whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates during its next meeting. However, analysts expect the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged. BTC registered a sharp decline as it entered the previous weekend, dropping over 2% on Thursday (May 29) and 1.51% on Friday to slip below the 20-day SMA and $105,000 and settle at $104,067. Despite the selling pressure, the price recovered over the weekend, rising 0.69% on Saturday and 0.95% on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,779. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $103,768 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $105,902. The price was back in the red on Tuesday, falling 0.44% to $105,436. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC fell almost 1%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,752. Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as the price fell 3%, dropping to an intraday low of $100,424 before settling at $101,614. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Friday, rising almost 3% to recoup most of its losses and settle at $104,378. The price continued to push higher on Saturday, increasing 1.15% to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,575. BTC could only register a marginal increase on Sunday and has fallen back into the red during the ongoing session, trading around $105,596. A drop below $105,000 could cause BTC to plunge to $100,000 or lower. On the other hand, buyers will look to regain control and push the price towards $110,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum’s (ETH) decline continued as it extended Sunday’s losses, falling below $2,500. ETH has been subdued in recent sessions after struggling to recover from a substantial 7% drop on Thursday, which saw the price plunge to a low of $2,393. ETH investors are cautiously consolidating as the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency tests a key support level at $2,500. Despite ETH’s subdued price action, institutional interest in the asset has registered a notable uptick. Ethereum ETFs have registered consistent inflows, with data from SoSoValue revealing inflows worth $281 million just last week alone. Institutional interest goes beyond ETFs, with companies beginning to buy ETH for their treasuries. SharpLink Gaming, a Nasdaq-listed company, recently announced a $425 million funding round to buy ETH. US-based Abraxas Capital also increased its ETH holdings to over $800 million. The altcoin is trading at the lower end of its trading range but has strong support at these levels. ETH raced to an intraday high of $2,790 on Thursday (May 29) as buyers attempted a move past $2,800. It lost momentum at this level and fell nearly 2% to $2,632. Bearish sentiment intensified on Friday as ETH plunged almost 4%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $2,600 to $2,532. The price registered a marginal decline on Saturday before rising 0.44% to end the weekend at $2,539. ETH rebounded on Monday, rising 2.66% to reclaim $2,600, cross the 20-day SMA and settle at $2,607. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped 0.53% on Tuesday to settle at $2,593. Source: TradingView ETH recovered on Wednesday, reaching an intraday high of $2,679 before settling at $2,607, ultimately registering a marginal increase. Bearish sentiment returned on Thursday as ETH plunged over 7%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $2,415, but not before hitting an intraday low of $2,415. However, it recovered on Friday, rising nearly 3% to $2,479. The price continued to push higher on Saturday, increasing 1.87% to reclaim $2,500 and settle at $2,525. Price action turned bearish on Sunday as ETH registered a marginal decline and fell to $2,511. The current session sees ETH down almost 1%, trading around $2,492. If ETH regains momentum, it could push towards $2,600. A break above this level could see the price surge to $2,800. However, if support does not hold, ETH could slip below $2,400. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) continued its upward trajectory over the weekend but has lost momentum during the ongoing session, starting the week in the red. SOL registered a sharp decline on Thursday, plunging to a low of $141 before recovering over the weekend to reclaim $150 and end Sunday at $152. If bullish sentiment returns, analysts predict a move to $160. However, if sellers retain control, the price could continue to decline and test $140. SOL has traded downwards since being rejected from $180 and the 200-day SMA. The altcoin registered a sharp decline on Wednesday (May 28) and Thursday, falling to $166. Bearish sentiment intensified on Friday as the price plunged over 6%, slipping below $160 and settling at $156. The weekend saw volatility as sellers attempted to overwhelm buyers. However, SOL registered a marginal increase on Saturday and rose almost 1% on Sunday despite falling to a low of $150 to settle at $157. Price action turned bearish on Monday, and SOL registered a marginal decline to settle at $156, but not before dropping to a low of $151. The price raced to an intraday high of $164 on Tuesday but lost momentum, falling over 1% to $155. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control on Wednesday as SOL fell 1.29% to $153. Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as the price plunged nearly 6%, slipping below $150 and settling at $144. Despite the bearish sentiment, SOL recovered on Friday, rising 2.47% and settling at $147. Price action remained bullish over the weekend as SOL rose 1.51% on Saturday and 1.56% on Sunday to reclaim $150 and settle at $152. However, it is back in the red during the ongoing session, with the price down over 1%, as sellers look to drive it below $150. Bittensor (TAO) Price Analysis Bittensor (TAO) fell below the 20-day SMA on Thursday (May 29) and settled at $414. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as the price fell over 9%, slipping below $400 and the 200-day SMA and settling at $376. TAO recovered on Saturday, surging over 14% to reclaim $400, cross the 200-day SMA and settle at $430. However, it could not cross the 20-day SMA and was back in the red on Sunday, dropping almost 4% to end the weekend at $414. The price declined on Monday, falling 2.51% to $403. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as TAO fell over 4%, slipping below $400 and the 200-day SMA and settling at $386.

Will the price of Pepe Coin ( PEPE ) rise this month? Let’s take a closer look at our Pepe June price prediction. Table of Contents What is PEPE? PEPE price factors for June Pepe crypto price prediction: general outlook Pepe price prediction: June 2025 What is PEPE? Pepe the Frog was first introduced in 2005 by Matt Furie in his Boy’s Club comic series. With his iconic catchphrase “Feels good man,” Pepe quickly became a viral internet meme. Fast forward to the 2021 crypto boom — Dogecoin’s rise brought meme coins into the spotlight, paving the way for Pepe coin. It quickly became the most well-known token inspired by the Pepe meme. The PEPE project made its official debut on X on April 4, 2023, and just 10 days later, it was live. It didn’t take long to catch fire — PEPE quickly shot up the ranks to become the third-largest meme coin by market cap, sitting just behind the giants: Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and Shiba Inu ( SHIB ). What’s going to shape the Pepe June price prediction? Is Pepe a good investment? PEPE price factors for June Meme coins like PEPE might not follow traditional market rules, but one thing’s clear — they live and die by hype, internet culture, and the strength of their communities. In June 2025, PEPE’s price continues to be driven by social media trends, influencer endorsements, and the ever-watchful eyes of its meme-loving fanbase. When excitement builds and attention floods in, the price tends to react fast — often with dramatic swings. While there’s little in the way of utility, the coin’s popularity and “fun factor” still attract traders hoping to catch the next wave. As always with meme coins, it’s high risk, high meme. What’s the current trend with Pepe’s price, and what’s the Pepe coin price prediction for the short term? Let’s check. Pepe crypto price prediction: general outlook Back in December 2024, Pepe saw a huge surge as the crypto market heated up and Bitcoin smashed through the $100,000 mark for the first time. Riding that wave, PEPE reached a new all-time high of $0.00002825. The hype didn’t last forever, though — its price cooled off not long after. But in May 2025, PEPE showed signs of life again, bouncing back to around $0.000016 and reminding investors it’s still in the game. As of June 6, 2025, Pepe is trading at $0.0000118, showing a 2.1% gain in the past 24 hours. Despite this short-term bump, the meme coin has fallen by 12% over the past week, based on data from crypto.news charts . PEPE 1-day chart, June 2025 | Source: crypto.news A few months back, Murad — a popular analyst on X — shared data showing that almost one-fifth of Pepe coin whales have never sold a single token. That’s a pretty strong signal that many big holders are in it for the long haul, likely betting on a future comeback or major price surge. This kind of conviction from early or large investors often boosts community confidence, hinting that despite short-term dips, there’s still belief in PEPE’s potential.

Will Pepe go up or down in the short term? Pepe price prediction: June 2025 CoinCodex shared a negative short-term PEPE price prediction, suggesting the coin could fall to $0.000008399 by July 5. Despite this outlook, the site’s technical analysis remained neutral, with 13 indicators flashing bearish signals and 15 showing bullish ones. Wallet Investor was also pessimistic in its Pepe price forecast, predicting the average price could drop to $0.00000712 by the second half of June 2025. DigitalCoinPrice was a bit more optimistic with its PEPE expectations, predicting that the coin’s average price will likely remain close to its current value of $0.000011137 throughout June. Should you invest in Pepe? PEPE is an Ethereum-based meme token with some standout features, including a deflationary model, a redistribution system, and a tax-free policy. These elements aim to support price stability and boost its potential for long-term growth. That said, most Pepe projections for June 2025 lean negative. What happens next will largely depend on broader market conditions and how things unfold in the coming weeks.

Compared With Bitcoin PEPE And BlockDAG in Token Presales,https://thecoinrise.com/is-nexchain-the-next-big-crypto-compared-with-bitcoin-pepe-and-blockdag-in-token-presales/,"The crypto presale market in 2025 is heating up, and investors are now focused on spotting early-stage gems. Among the top crypto presales, three names stand out: Nexchain, Bitcoin Pepe, and BlockDAG. While each offers something different, only one shows true long-term potential. Nexchain is gaining momentum as a new crypto token presale built for real-world utility with advanced AI infrastructure. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Pepe brings meme coin energy, and BlockDAG leans on high-volume buyer rewards. For anyone browsing the latest crypto presale list or looking to buy presale crypto, it’s important to compare utility, traction, and growth potential to decide on the best crypto presale to buy right now. Nexchain: How to Participate in the Nexchain Crypto Presale Nexchain’s token presales are designed with accessibility in mind. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or just starting, the platform offers clear instructions and flexible purchase amounts. You can buy NEX tokens directly with USDT, ETH, or BNB through Nexchain’s presale dashboard. Once purchased, tokens are instantly sent to your wallet and are ready to be used in the future ecosystem. These tokens support decentralized finance, identity systems, logistics automation, and more—all powered by Nexchain’s AI-driven Layer-1 blockchain. Currently in Stage 17, the price per NEX token is $0.066. The projected listing price is $0.30, offering a potential return of 455%. Nexchain has already raised $4.1 million USDT, making it one of the most promising crypto presale projects in this cycle. For anyone exploring crypto coins on presale, Nexchain offers more than hype—it offers real tech and early entry at a discounted price. Bitcoin Pepe: Meme Culture Meets Market Momentum Bitcoin PEPE has found a unique space in the presale crypto tokens market by combining humor with macro narratives. Its branding blends meme coin appeal with a speculative Bitcoin-linked theme, which has drawn strong attention across social platforms. So far, it has raised $13,934,128, with the token currently priced at $0.0396. Tokens are selling fast, and the limited supply is driving urgency. If it maintains momentum, it could mirror the success of past meme coins that delivered 100x gains. However, while Bitcoin PEPE has strong community backing, it lacks the utility and infrastructure offered by more technically grounded projects like Nexchain. For investors looking for short-term excitement, it has potential. But for those who want sustainable growth, utility-focused pre sale cryptocurrency projects may offer better upside. BlockDAG: High-Stakes Presale With Big Rewards BlockDAG is turning heads in the crypto ICO presale space with its “Buyer Battles” concept. Every day, the biggest buyer wins a share of 150 million BDAG tokens, making it a high-action presale that rewards bold participation. At just $0.0018 per token, BlockDAG offers one of the lowest entry points among all crypto coins on presale. The upcoming “GO LIVE” event on June 13 is expected to drive price shifts. Daily winners are already earning millions, creating urgency among sidelined investors. While it excels in presale gamification, BlockDAG is still early in terms of infrastructure and long-term utility. For thrill-seekers, it’s a compelling project. But when compared to a robust platform like Nexchain, it offers more risk and less foundational strength. Final Thoughts: Which Crypto Presale Stands Out? Each of these token presales brings a different appeal. Bitcoin PEPE leads in meme coin virality, while BlockDAG adds high-stakes excitement to the crypto presale scene. But when it comes to real-world tech, enterprise readiness, and long-term ROI, Nexchain is in a class of its own. Nexchain has raised nearly $4 million, built a live testnet, and already enables smart automation across industries.

The project provides users with a digital “World ID” and WLD crypto rewards. Worldcoin is engaging with UK regulators to address privacy concerns over its technology. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, is expanding his futuristic identity verification project, World, to the United Kingdom. Launching this week in London, the initiative aims to verify users as human in a world increasingly overrun by AI-generated content and deep fakes. The technology relies on a custom hardware device called “the Orb,” which performs an in-person scan of a person’s iris and face. This scan generates a unique, private code used to create a “World ID,” a digital passport that verifies the holder as a unique human being. Altman’s team believes that as generative AI becomes more pervasive, traditional authentication methods are no longer sufficient to distinguish humans from bots. How ‘The Orb’ Works and Why It Comes With Crypto Rewards The Orb device does more than just verify identity. After completing their first scan, users receive a portion of Worldcoin’s native cryptocurrency, WLD.

Citing data from Goldman Sachs, macro analyst Adam Kobeissi reports that $37 billion left US equities in May, which is the most in at least 12 months. “This marks the 2nd consecutive monthly net withdrawal after -$7 billion in April. Year-to-date, foreign investors have withdrawn a net -$31 billion from US equities. By comparison, these same investors bought a net +$201 billion in November and December last year. This comes even as the market recovers and the 90-day reciprocal tariff pause that began on April 10th. Foreigners are rotating out of US stocks.” Source: The Kobeissi Letter/X However, Kobeissi also reports that retail investors are picking up the slack, buoying markets, potentially compensating for foreign investors’ capital flight. Citing data from JPMorgan Chase, the analyst reports that retail investors are gobbling up tens of billions of dollars worth of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and individual equities. “Retail investors bought +$23 billion of US equities in May, adding to +$40 billion in March and April. This is roughly in-line with $25 billion in average monthly net purchases this year, according to JPMorgan. Year-to-date, individual investors have bought a record +$150 billion in ETFs and single stocks. Over the last week, retail traders purchased $6.8 billion, with $4.4 billion flowing into Tesla, TSLA. However, the average retail investment portfolio is now down -2.6% year-to-date, underperforming the S&P 500’s increase of +1.0%.

45718660,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=167200,1749469548,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45718660.jpeg,"Nasdaq Proposes Bold Expansion for Hashdex Crypto ETF, Adding XRP, SOL & More",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/nasdaq-hashdex-etf-expansion/,"BitcoinWorld Nasdaq Proposes Bold Expansion for Hashdex Crypto ETF, Adding XRP, SOL & More Hey there, crypto enthusiasts! Big news is brewing in the world where traditional finance meets digital assets. The American stock exchange Nasdaq has made a significant move that could pave the way for broader cryptocurrency exposure within regulated investment products. They’ve filed a proposal with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that could dramatically change the landscape for one particular fund: the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF (NCIQ) . What Did Nasdaq Propose Regarding the Hashdex ETF? At its core, the proposal from Nasdaq seeks to change the underlying benchmark index for the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF . Currently, this Hashdex ETF tracks the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index (NCIUS). The new proposal suggests transitioning to a much broader index, the Nasdaq Crypto Index (NCI). Why is this important? The current NCIUS index is relatively limited in the assets it tracks. The proposed Nasdaq Crypto Index (NCI), however, includes a wider array of cryptocurrencies. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a potential expansion that could bring several prominent altcoins into the fold of a regulated financial product. The NCI index currently includes nine distinct assets: Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) XRP Solana (SOL) Cardano (ADA) Stellar (XLM) Chainlink (LINK) Litecoin (LTC) Uniswap (UNI) This move signifies a potential shift towards recognizing and including a more diverse set of digital assets within traditional financial structures like ETFs. Understanding the Crypto ETF Landscape and Hashdex’s Role Crypto ETF products have been a major focus for investors seeking exposure to the digital asset market without directly holding cryptocurrencies. ETFs offer convenience, liquidity, and often operate within regulated frameworks, making them attractive to both retail and institutional investors. Hashdex is an asset management firm that has been active in the crypto space, offering various investment products. Their partnership with Nasdaq for the NCIQ ETF is one example of how traditional financial infrastructure is being leveraged for crypto investments. The benchmark index that an ETF tracks is crucial. It determines which assets the fund holds (or gains exposure to) and in what proportion. Changing the benchmark from NCIUS to NCI for the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF means the fund’s underlying exposure would shift from a narrower selection to the nine assets listed above. Why Does Including XRP and SOL in a Crypto ETF Benchmark Matter? The potential inclusion of assets like XRP and SOL is particularly noteworthy. Both have large market capitalizations and active communities, but they also have unique histories and market positions. XRP: Ripple’s associated cryptocurrency, XRP , has been at the center of a long-standing legal battle with the SEC. While there have been favorable rulings for Ripple regarding programmatic sales not being securities, its regulatory status remains a key point of discussion. Inclusion in a Nasdaq index used for an ETF benchmark could be seen by some as a step towards greater mainstream acceptance and regulatory clarity, although SEC approval for the ETF change itself is still required. Solana (SOL): SOL has emerged as a major player in the blockchain space, known for its high transaction throughput and growing ecosystem. Its inclusion reflects its increasing prominence and market cap relative to other altcoins. For investors interested in exposure to high-growth potential altcoins beyond just BTC and ETH, SOL represents a significant addition. Beyond just XRP and SOL , the inclusion of ADA, XLM, LINK, LTC, and UNI also broadens the scope, offering exposure to different segments of the crypto market, from smart contract platforms (ADA, UNI) to payments (XLM, LTC) and oracles (LINK). Potential Benefits and Challenges of This Expansion If the SEC approves Nasdaq’s proposal, it could bring several benefits: Broader Diversification: Investors in the Hashdex ETF would gain exposure to a wider range of cryptocurrencies, potentially reducing concentration risk compared to funds solely focused on BTC or ETH. Increased Accessibility: Providing regulated access to a basket of altcoins through an ETF makes it easier for traditional investors to gain exposure without navigating multiple exchanges or private key management. Enhanced Legitimacy: Inclusion in a Nasdaq index and an SEC-regulated ETF benchmark lends a degree of legitimacy to the included altcoins, potentially attracting more institutional interest over time. However, challenges remain: SEC Approval: The proposal must be approved by the SEC, which has historically been cautious regarding crypto products, especially those including assets other than Bitcoin futures or spot Bitcoin. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory status of several included altcoins, particularly XRP , could still pose hurdles. Market Volatility: While diversification helps, a broader Crypto ETF benchmark still means the fund will be subject to the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. What’s Next for the Nasdaq Proposal and the Hashdex Crypto ETF? This filing is just a step in the process. The SEC will review the proposal, and there will likely be a period for public comment. The outcome is not guaranteed and depends on the SEC’s assessment of various factors, including investor protection and market integrity. For investors interested in the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF or gaining exposure to assets like XRP and SOL through regulated means, monitoring the SEC’s response to this proposal is crucial. It represents a potential expansion of regulated crypto investment options beyond the currently available spot Bitcoin ETFs. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Crypto ETFs Nasdaq’s proposal to broaden the benchmark for the Hashdex Crypto ETF is a significant development, signaling a potential move towards greater inclusion of prominent altcoins like XRP and SOL in regulated financial products. While SEC approval is required and challenges exist, this step highlights the ongoing convergence of traditional finance and the evolving cryptocurrency market. It’s a bold proposal that, if approved, could offer investors new avenues for diversified crypto exposure and further legitimize a wider array of digital assets in the eyes of the financial world.

Under the terms, Qualcomm will pay 183 pence for each Alphawave share, a significant premium over recent trading levels, and the transaction is slated to complete in the first quarter of 2026, subject to both shareholder and regulatory approvals. London’s tech sector is slowly ceding ground to the US Founded with a focus on high-speed connectivity technology for data centers and AI applications, Alphawave first hit the London market in 2021 at an initial price of 410 pence per share. Since its debut, however, its share price has struggled to reach that level again, held back by a relatively concentrated customer base and the broader uncertainties affecting semiconductor firms operating between the US and China. Qualcomm first revealed its interest in April, and after months of careful negotiation, Alphawave’s board has now given the deal its full backing. Shareholders face a choice; they can accept the cash offer of 183 pence per share or swap each Alphawave share for 0.01662 newly issued Qualcomm shares. Qualcomm has also floated an alternative package involving two types of exchangeable securities, 0.00964 units of “Series A” and 0.00698 of “Series B” per Alphawave share, but Alphawave’s directors have declined to recommend these hybrid instruments, noting that their value could prove hard to pin down. For the takeover to go through, at least 75% of Alphawave’s shares must vote in favor; roughly half of the register, including board members, has already pledged support. According to The Guardian, this deal underlines an ongoing trend in which London’s tech sector is increasingly losing its crown jewels to US markets. In recent years, high-profile listings such as Wise have signaled plans to move their main share registration to New York, while Deliveroo agreed earlier this year to a £2.9 billion takeover by DoorDash. Darktrace, the Cambridge-based cybersecurity specialist, was snapped up by private equity firm Thoma Bravo for $5.3 billion last year. Outside of pure tech, companies like Ashtead, Flutter Entertainment and CRH have all opted to shift their primary listings across the Atlantic, lured by deeper pools of capital and higher valuations. Transaction strategic for Qualcomm to power its AI-related business From Qualcomm’s perspective, snapping up Alphawave makes strategic sense. Qualcomm’s core business, power-efficient processors for smartphones, has encountered slower growth, and the company is eager to diversify into data-center infrastructure and AI-related markets. Alphawave brings to the table advanced wired connectivity and interconnect technologies that dovetail neatly with Qualcomm’s existing portfolio of central and neural processing units. Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm’s CEO, praised Alphawave’s “leading high-speed wired connectivity and compute technologies” and expressed confidence about the combined teams. “The combined teams share the goal of building advanced technology solutions and enabling next-level connected computing performance across a wide array of high growth areas, including datacentre infrastructure.” Amon. Alphawave’s leadership is equally upbeat. CEO Tony Pialis described the acquisition as a chance to accelerate the company’s roadmap, broaden its customer reach and deepen its product suite. In recent quarters, Alphawave reported a marked uptick in orders from North American AI firms, an encouraging sign that its chips are gaining traction where processing speed and bandwidth are most in demand. For those Alphawave investors who opt for cash, the deal offers an immediate exit at a hefty premium over the market price. But for shareholders who choose Qualcomm equity, it provides a stake in a global semiconductor heavyweight well-positioned to ride the wave of AI, 5G and data center expansion. Either way, this transaction leaves a narrower field of UK-listed chip designers and raises fresh questions about London’s ability to retain cutting-edge technology ventures. As the semiconductor landscape becomes ever more competitive and capital-hungry, London’s government and financial community may need to rethink how they support fast-growing tech firms.

While the token surged by 46% in January , the momentum didn’t last. February and March saw declines of 29.3% and 2.52% , respectively. April brought a small rebound of 4.98% , but May slipped again by 0.80%. Now, in the last 30 days , XRP is down another 5.3% . But should you panic? Don’t Panic—Says X Finance Bull Popular crypto analyst X Finance Bull believes this pullback is just a temporary correction . He points to regulatory clarity, global adoption , and institutional interest as major bullish catalysts brewing under the surface. “This is just the calm before the storm,” he noted in a recent post. XRP vs. SEC: Regulatory Clarity Just Days Away? Mark your calendar— June 16 , the SEC must submit a settlement status report to the U.S. Court of Appeals. Insiders suggest a settlement is already in place , unofficially. X Finance Bull highlights that XRP is already compliant with global standards like: ISO 20022 Basel III This compliance gives XRP a massive edge in the global financial system. XRP: The Future “Internet of Money”? The analyst believes XRP is evolving into the “Internet of Money” —a financial infrastructure for instant, borderless money transfers . He claims that countries like China, Singapore, and Dubai are preparing to use XRP for: Travel payments Forex transfers Treasury operations Banks may favor Ripple’s tech over outdated systems because of its speed, cost-efficiency , and regulatory readiness . Corporates & Institutions Are Betting Big on XRP Institutional interest is rising sharply: Companies like Webus and VivoPower have raised hundreds of millions to build XRP-based treasuries. The analyst even hints that Elon Musk could adopt XRP for fast, compliant payments. RLUSD and XRP Spot ETFs: Bullish Catalysts Ripple’s new stablecoin , RLUSD , is making waves. Approved in Dubai , the token has already reached: Market cap: $381.75 million 24h trading volume: $24.05 million And there’s more— 19+ major firms , including: Grayscale WisdomTree ProShares …are showing interest in launching XRP Spot ETFs. That’s a strong vote of confidence from the big players. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : John Deaton Reveals Major XRP Holdings Amid Bitcoin Debate , Political Winds Favor Ripple Since Donald Trump’s return to office , U.S. policies have become increasingly pro-crypto —a major win for Ripple.

Final Thoughts XRP may be down short-term, but the long-term signals are stronger than ever .

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. AVAX and LINK backers are quietly piling into XYZVerse, a rising memecoin blending sports fandom with crypto momentum, and eyeing a 30x return. Table of Contents Can XYZVerse deliver a 30x return? Here’s what to watch Avalanche struggles Chainlink continues dip Conclusion Investors known for backing AVAX and LINK are turning their attention to a new cryptocurrency that’s generating quiet buzz. This emerging digital asset is being discreetly accumulated ahead of a potential significant surge in value. The silent move by savvy investors is stirring curiosity, hinting at a possible major rally that could yield remarkable returns. Can XYZVerse deliver a 30x return? Here’s what to watch XYZVerse is making its entry into the memecoin arena at a time when community-driven tokens are at the forefront of speculative interest. The success of projects like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk has shown that strong branding, viral momentum, and engaged communities can propel memecoins to staggering highs. With altcoin season gaining traction, investor appetite is shifting toward low-cap opportunities, especially presale tokens with a compelling narrative. Positioned at the intersection of sports culture and crypto hype, XYZVerse could be next in line if it maintains momentum post-launch. Strong branding and sports influencer ties: Built around athlete culture and competition, XYZVerse taps into a massive fanbase and virality potential. Deflationary tokenomics: With 17.13% of the token supply burned, XYZ introduces scarcity from the start. Solid liquidity backing: 15% of the supply is allocated to liquidity, ensuring smoother price discovery after launch. Community incentives: 10% of tokens are set aside to reward holders and boost engagement. Price forecast for XYZ Current presale price: $0.003333 Projected launch target: $0.10 (30x ROI based on internal forecasts) Possible early ATH: $0.15 – $0.25 (driven by exchange listings and FOMO) Long-term outlook: $0.20 – $0.40 (contingent on growth, partnerships, and ecosystem expansion) Could XYZ really 30x? While a 30x return is speculative, it’s not out of reach. Several conditions could make this trajectory possible: Tier-1 listings – Appearances on platforms like OKX, KuCoin, or Binance would provide major exposure and instant liquidity. Community growth – Memecoin value thrives on viral attention. If XYZVerse leverages its influencer network well, engagement could spike. Market tailwinds – In a bullish altcoin cycle, lower-cap tokens like XYZ often outperform. XYZVerse has the framework to achieve exponential growth. If the team executes its marketing strategy effectively, secures listings, and sustains community hype, the $0.10+ milestone, representing a 30x jump from presale, may not just be a fantasy.

XYZVerse coin could deliver massive returns, overtaking Bitcoin Avalanche struggles Source: TradingView Avalanche ( AVAX ) has faced notable declines in recent months. Over the past six months, its price has dropped by 62.41%. In the last month, AVAX decreased by nearly 3%, and over the past week, it saw a sharp decline of over 12%. Currently, the coin trades between $19.00 and $23.55, reflecting significant volatility. Technical indicators present mixed signals for AVAX. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 46.73, near neutral territory. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level at -0.2800 suggests bearish momentum. AVAX is hovering around its 10-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of $19.05 but remains below the 100-day SMA of $20.59, indicating possible short-term consolidation. If AVAX breaks above the nearest resistance at $26.22, it could target the second resistance at $30.77, offering a potential increase of around 35%. Conversely, if it falls below the support at $17.12, it may test the next support at $12.56, implying a further drop of about 27%. Traders should monitor these levels closely. Chainlink continues dip Source: TradingView Chainlink ( LINK ) has experienced significant fluctuations recently. Over the past six months, its price has dropped by 46.67%. In the last month, it decreased by 4.29%, and just this past week, it fell by 11.92%. Currently, LINK is trading between $12.93 and $15.69, reflecting ongoing volatility in the market. Technical indicators show a mixed outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 44.56, suggesting that the asset is moving toward oversold territory but hasn’t reached it yet. The Simple Moving Average over 10 days is $13.07, slightly below the 100-day average of $13.88. This positioning can be interpreted as a bearish sign. The MACD level sits at -0.1741, indicating potential downward momentum, while the Stochastic indicator is at 53.62. Key price levels are drawing attention. The nearest resistance level is $17.32, and the nearest support is $11.79. Breaking above the resistance could signal a rise of around 33% from current levels, while dropping below support might lead to a decline of about 9%. The second resistance and support levels are at $20.09 and $9.02, respectively. These markers suggest that LINK could experience significant moves if these levels are tested.

If inflation heats up, it could shake markets and impact Bitcoin’s price. Everyone’s watching closely over what’s next for Bitcoin. Bitcoin slightly recovered today and is currently trading at $107,423, up 1.8% in the past day. It traded flat near $105,650 after forming a doji candle on Sunday. Its network activity has also slowed with daily on-chain transactions dropping to a one-year low, according to Blockchain.com . Altcoins like XRP and DOGE also fell 1-2%. But they have recovered slightly today and are trading in green. Bitcoin Stuck In a Tight Range QCP Capital in a latest note shared that traders are keeping a close eye on Bitcoin as it stays stuck in a tight range heading into the summer. Even though implied volatility is at 1-year lows and looks cheap, actual price moves are even smaller. Historically, the short term volatility usually drops more by July, just like last year when Bitcoin struggled to break $70K and the volatility fell sharply. They pointed out that if Bitcoin breaks below $100K or jumps above $110K, it could spark fresh interest in the market. But for now, there is no clear event to push it that way. While the recent macro news caused quick and short live reactions for a moment, but those moves quickly faded without any lasting effect. Bitcoin Up For a Big Move In the Long Term? After the strong US jobs report boosted the stock market and caused gold prices to fall, Bitcoin was mostly unchanged and showed signs of slowing down. The trading activity in Bitcoin futures is increasing and fewer investor are putting money into Bitcoin ETFs. Traders are now betting on Bitcoin to do well later in the year, not anytime soon. Bitcoin might be gearing up for a move higher as fresh data shows a big liquidity zone around $106,736. These zones often pull price action like a magnet, and with BTC already testing $105K, a breakout could be on the way. New All-time Highs Soon? Also, Bitcoin’s realized profit/loss has dropped 90% since June 4, which means that fewer investors are selling at a loss. This reduces the selling pressure and supports a potential rise. With Bitcoin showing no clear direction on the daily chart, analysts believe that it might dip further before making a move toward new all-time highs. Analsyts at Swissblock warn that rising inflation could trigger volatility, and BTC may test support around $104K. Analyst Mickybull Crypto also sees a possible drop to $101,500 due to a head-and-shoulders pattern. If BTC loses the $100K level, it could face a deeper correction. ““Short-term correction, then new all-time highs,” he said. Bitcoin, what is the plan? Inflation data in the week ahead could unleash volatility. Bulls are slowly rebuilding structure and regrouping, eager to flip the game. First steps are in, but a short-term test of the lower range ($104k) looks likely. Stay sharp. pic.twitter.com/PI6HBSVyhL — Swissblock (@swissblock__) June 9, 2025 Analysts say that any price dip will be short-lived because the long-term uptrend is strong. Once it breaks the 2021 trendline, it could quickly climb to $140K–$150K. Bitcoin’s weekly chart also shows strong bullish signs with both a cup-and-handle and a bull flag pattern, pointing to a possible breakout above $109,000. These patterns suggest BTC could surge about 35%, reaching around $143,000. Key Events This Week- Market optimism is high as the U.S. China trade talks kick off in London, with Trump saying the meeting “should go very well.” All eyes are now on Wednesday’s US inflation report to see if the tariffs are pushing prices higher. If inflation is hotter than expected, it could reduce chances of Fed rate cuts and shake up markets. The job reports on Thursday is also a key event which the traders are watching closely for any signs.",Uncategorized|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-09 11:48:49

Pepe’s Dog (ZEUS), the memecoin inspired by Pepe the Frog’s iconic dog, has landed its third major CEX listing with its debut on KuCoin . The listing on KuCoin follows previous listings on Poloniex and LBank. While the token’s on-chain contract remains listed as ZEUS, KuCoin will display it under the ticker ZEUSETH due to a ticker duplication issue. ZEUS’s listing marks another milestone in the memecoin ‘s rapid ascent since launch, where it grew from a $50,000 market cap to over $20 million at its peak in late May. At press time, ZEUS holds a market cap of $6.7 million as ZEUS price recovers from its all-time low reached five days ago. It’s currently up 170% since ATL.

Alongside him, Jon “Jagged” Eyrick — the owner of the real-life Zeus — has joined the project as a core contributor and IP rights holder. “Never thought my dog would end up a meme legend, but here we are. Teaming up with ND Haus, the OG artist who first drew Zeus, is surreal. As the guy who built the Binance API and the owner of the real Zeus, it’s wild (and kinda awesome) to see him become the face of a project that actually respects the culture and the roots,” commented Eyrick.

The stock climbed over 12% early in the day, hitting 1,505 yen ($10.42), and peaked at 1,641 yen ($11.36), a 22% jump from the previous session. This surge comes as Metaplanet revises its Bitcoin strategy to target 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027—ten times its original goal. In an announcement dated June 6, Metaplanet unveiled this updated target under a new “stock acquisition rights program,” replacing its previous goal of 21,000 BTC. If the plan succeeds, Metaplanet would become the world’s second-largest corporate Bitcoin holder, trailing only Strategy, led by Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor. The “555 Million Plan” and Corporate BTC Trend Metaplanet’s revised target forms the foundation of what it calls the “555 million plan,” under which the company aims to acquire 201,112 BTC over the next few years—estimated to cost more than $21 billion at current prices. By the end of 2026, the firm hopes to hold at least 100,000 BTC. Currently, Metaplanet owns 8,888 BTC , including 1,088 acquired in its most recent purchase announced on June 2. This isn’t the first time the firm’s Bitcoin moves have influenced its share price. Since first disclosing BTC purchases in July 2024, Metaplanet’s stock has skyrocketed over 1,700%. It joins a growing list of companies globally adopting BTC as a treasury asset. South Korea’s K Wave Media recently joined the trend, while data from Bitbo shows corporate Bitcoin holdings now exceed three million BTC—about 3.2% of all BTC that will ever exist. Mixed Market Reactions to Bitcoin Strategies While Metaplanet’s shares have responded positively, other companies have experienced mixed outcomes after announcing Bitcoin acquisitions. Paris-based Blockchain Group’s stock rose 225% after BTC buys , and DigiAsia Corp saw a 91% increase. However, Norway’s K33 saw its share price dip by nearly 2% after similar news. Even GameStop, after announcing and executing its Bitcoin purchase , faced volatile market reactions. As Metaplanet pushes ahead with its ambitious acquisition roadmap, investor optimism appears high—but whether this translates into long-term value will depend on Bitcoin’s performance and broader market sentiment.

Ripple , the company behind the digital payment protocol XRP , has just made a significant move to accelerate the growth of the Web3 landscape in Japan. This initiative signals a strong commitment to fostering innovation on the XRPL (XRP Ledger) and supporting the burgeoning ecosystem of decentralized applications and services. What’s Behind Ripple’s Generous Crypto Grants for Web3 Japan? In a move poised to significantly boost the development scene, Ripple has officially announced a new grant program targeting Japanese Web3 projects. The initiative, unveiled through Ripple’s official channels, is a collaborative effort with Web3 Salon, a Japan-based organization dedicated to promoting Web3 innovation. This partnership aims to identify and empower promising projects building on or integrating with the XRPL. The core of this announcement is the financial backing being provided. Ripple is making substantial crypto grants available, offering as much as $200,000 to each selected Japanese Web3 project over the next year. This funding comes directly from the dedicated XRPL Japan and Korea Fund, a strategic fund established to drive innovation and adoption of the XRP Ledger in these key Asian markets. The XRPL Japan and Korea Fund: Fueling Regional Growth The XRPL Japan and Korea Fund is a critical component of Ripple’s broader strategy to expand the utility and reach of the XRP Ledger. Launched previously, this fund is specifically allocated to support projects, partnerships, and initiatives that contribute to the growth of the XRPL ecosystem within these two influential nations. Japan, with its technologically savvy population and increasing interest in blockchain technology, represents a prime market for Web3 development. By channeling funds through this dedicated vehicle, Ripple ensures that resources are focused on initiatives that understand the local market nuances and regulatory environment. The partnership with Web3 Salon adds another layer of local expertise, helping to identify high-potential projects and provide them with the necessary support beyond just financial grants. Why Focus on Web3 Japan Now? Japan has long been a significant player in the global technology and finance sectors. While sometimes perceived as cautious regarding cryptocurrency regulation compared to some other nations, there is a strong undercurrent of innovation and growing interest in Web3 technologies like NFTs, decentralized finance (DeFi), and blockchain gaming. Several factors make Web3 Japan a strategic target for Ripple ‘s investment: Technological Sophistication: Japan has a highly advanced technological infrastructure and a population that is generally receptive to new technologies. Creative Industries: Japan’s strong presence in gaming, anime, and manga provides fertile ground for Web3 applications like NFTs and blockchain-based collectibles. Increasing Developer Interest: A growing number of developers in Japan are exploring blockchain technology and its potential applications. Regulatory Clarity (Emerging): While complex, the regulatory landscape is becoming clearer, providing a more stable environment for businesses to operate. Investing in Web3 Japan is not just about providing funds; it’s about cultivating a community of developers and entrepreneurs who can build practical, impactful applications on the XRPL, driving real-world utility for XRP . How Do These Crypto Grants Benefit the XRPL Ecosystem? The provision of crypto grants is a proven method for stimulating ecosystem growth in the blockchain space. For the XRPL, these grants are expected to yield several key benefits: Increased Development Activity: Financial support lowers the barrier to entry for developers and encourages them to build on the XRPL. Innovation Boost: Grants enable projects to explore novel use cases and push the boundaries of what’s possible on the ledger. New Applications and Services: Funding supports the creation of new dApps, tools, and services that add value to the ecosystem. Enhanced Utility for XRP: Projects building on XRPL often utilize XRP for various functions, potentially increasing its utility and demand. Community Expansion: Supporting local projects helps build a stronger, more engaged community of developers and users in Japan. By investing in Web3 Japan , Ripple is strategically expanding the global footprint of the XRPL and diversifying the types of applications hosted on the ledger beyond its traditional focus on payments. What Kind of Projects Can Hope to Receive Funding? While specific criteria will likely be detailed by Web3 Salon and the XRPL Japan and Korea Fund, typical blockchain grant programs look for projects that demonstrate: Innovation: Novel ideas or unique approaches to solving problems using blockchain. Utility: Projects that offer real-world value or solve a specific need. Feasibility: A clear roadmap and a capable team to execute the project. Alignment with XRPL: Projects that leverage the unique features of the XRP Ledger, such as its speed, low transaction costs, or upcoming smart contract capabilities (via the Hooks amendment). Contribution to the Ecosystem: Projects that can attract users, developers, or businesses to the XRPL. Given Japan’s strengths, we might see a focus on areas like: NFT platforms and marketplaces Gaming and metaverse applications DeFi protocols Supply chain solutions Tools and infrastructure for developers The $200,000 per project amount is substantial and indicates that Ripple is looking to support projects with the potential for significant impact and growth, not just small experiments. This level of funding can truly accelerate a project from concept to launch and scale. Looking Ahead: The Future is Bright for Web3 Japan and XRPL This initiative by Ripple is more than just financial aid; it’s a vote of confidence in the potential of Web3 Japan and the capabilities of the XRP Ledger. As these funded projects develop and launch, they will contribute to a more vibrant, diverse, and robust XRPL ecosystem in the region. The collaboration with Web3 Salon is key, providing not just funding but also potential mentorship, networking opportunities, and guidance navigating the local landscape. This holistic approach increases the likelihood of success for the selected projects. The impact could extend beyond Japan, showcasing the potential of the XRPL for a wide range of Web3 applications and potentially inspiring similar initiatives in other regions. For those following XRP and the XRPL, this is a positive development signaling continued investment in the ledger’s future and utility. In Conclusion: Ripple’s commitment of significant crypto grants through the XRPL Japan and Korea Fund, in partnership with Web3 Salon, marks a pivotal moment for Web3 Japan . By providing up to $200,000 per project, Ripple is directly fueling innovation, encouraging development on the XRPL, and strengthening its presence in a crucial Asian market. This initiative is set to unlock new possibilities, drive adoption, and showcase the versatility of the XRP Ledger for the next generation of decentralized applications.

The platform’s global user base surpassed 40 million, up from 30 million in December 2024 — a 33% increase in just five months. Key Highlights: User base exceeded 40 million (+33% since Dec 2024 ) 214 new tokens listed in May (+33.7% MoM) Average trading volume per user up 45.09% Top 10 newly listed tokens averaged +2300.95% in peak gains About 40,000 users joined Airdrop+ campaigns Listing Activity and Trading Volume Growth MEXC listed 214 new tokens in May, marking one of the most active listing months to date. Trading volume tied to these listings jumped by 46.7%, while average trading volume per user increased by 45.09% — signaling rising user engagement and growing confidence in MEXC’s early-stage project selection. MEXC’s total daily trading volume reached $4.1 billion according to CoinMarketCap, making it the second-largest platform by trading volume among leading crypto exchanges. Sector Momentum: AI, GameFi, Meme Coins Some of the strongest gains came from sectors that continue to define the next market cycle. AI infrastructure token AGT posted a peak gain of +3,770.10%, followed closely by blockchain gaming project NXPC (+3,756.30%) and PayFi protocol HUMA (+1,170.00%). Meme coins remained a major force in May, with retail-driven tokens from Solana and BNB Chain dominating charts. GOONC surged +3,400%, B gained +3,001.20%, and MOONPIG rallied +753.33%, demonstrating the power of meme communities in driving liquidity and excitement. User Incentives: Airdrops and Launchpools May also marked a record month for user rewards and event participation. MEXC hosted 58 Airdrop+ campaigns, more than doubling the number from April. The combined prize pool exceeded 3 million USDT, attracting nearly 40,000 users. Campaigns like AIOT (7,000+ participants, ~320 USDT value per user) and HUMA (100 USDT in tokens, followed by a 1,170% gain) stood out for their strong user response and post-listing performance. Launchpool events continued to deliver high returns. The ICEBERG pool offered an 8,488.44% APR, while the ongoing EIN Launchpool, open until July 17 , remains attractive due to its high rewards and relatively low participation. Looking Ahead With momentum across listings, incentives, and user growth, MEXC continues to strengthen its position as a global launchpad for high-potential tokens. Strategic focus remains on trending verticals such as AI, Real World Assets (RWA), GameFi, and the TON ecosystem, where user demand and innovation are converging. About MEXC Founded in 2018, MEXC is committed to being “Your Easiest Way to Crypto.” Serving over 40 million users across 170+ countries, MEXC is known for its broad selection of trending tokens, everyday airdrop opportunities, and low trading fees.

While many assets focus on expansion and inflationary tokenomics, XRP is consistently reducing its total supply through protocol-based transaction fees. These fees are not redistributed or reallocated, they are burned permanently. As of now, over 13.9 million XRP have been destroyed. At the current price of $2.16, this represents more than $30 million worth of tokens. Community Perspectives on Long-Term Value A recent post by Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL), a known voice in the XRP community, highlighted this cumulative burn figure. In response, community members emphasized the importance of this reduction as a strategic advantage for XRP in the broader digital finance ecosystem. XRP is deflationary, All transaction fees are simply burned, overtime as volume ramps up the scarcity of XRP quickly increases. So far 13.9M XRP has been burned ($30M) on average 3-4 thousand XRP are burned per day pic.twitter.com/ifdmbhq7cm — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) June 8, 2025 One commenter described the process as XRP “quietly burning itself into scarcity,” reinforcing the idea that this mechanism is intentionally driving growth. Every transaction consumes a small amount of XRP , a cost that is irretrievably burned, and he noted that an average of 3,000 to 4,000 XRP are destroyed daily. The long-term implications for the asset’s scarcity are increasingly drawing attention from the XRP community and market observers. Another observer extended the logic further, suggesting that if utility and transaction volume grow consistently, the theoretical endgame of constant burning is total supply depletion. While XRP’s design includes a minimum reserve requirement to prevent account spam and ensure network stability, the commenter’s point underscores a broader perception: the deflationary mechanism gives XRP a built-in scarcity model that contrasts with inflation-prone monetary systems. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Strategic Role in Global Finance Beyond the mathematics of deflation, XRP is also positioned as a utility-driven asset. Another user highlighted its potential role in moving global liquidity, potentially replacing traditional systems like SWIFT . The comment referenced XRP’s connections with regions such as the UAE and BRICS nations , and a belief that the asset is “backed by USA gold.” However, such claims remain speculative without official confirmation. XRP’s value proposition rests in its real-world utility , and its deflationary nature makes it even more valuable. With over 13.9 million XRP already burned and thousands more disappearing each day, this ongoing reduction enhances the asset’s scarcity. As its supply lowers and it gains prominence in global finance, those who invest early will benefit from long-term appreciation.

As of June 9, 2025, XRP is trading at $2.25, edging slightly lower on the day but holding recent support levels. While the price has been consolidating in a tight range for weeks, one key technical indicator is starting to turn, potentially laying the groundwork for the next move. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on XRP’s daily chart has reversed from multi-week lows, rising from below 40 to around 50.5 at the time of writing. Notably, this marks the first sustained upward cross in momentum since early May, suggesting that bearish exhaustion may be setting in. The RSI crossing back above 50 is often interpreted by traders as a shift toward neutral to bullish momentum. More importantly, the RSI had been printing a series of higher lows, a bullish divergence compared to XRP’s price action, which has largely remained flat over the same period. XRP RSI. Source: Finbold/TradingView XRP appears to be stabilizing after its corrective phase: When you see RSI gradually recover from oversold or low-neutral zones while price holds key support, that’s typically a signal of buyers regaining confidence. It doesn’t guarantee immediate upside, but it tells you that momentum is building under the surface. Traders will now be eyeing the $2.56–$2.60 resistance zone, a level that has repeatedly capped XRP’s advances over the past two months. A breakout above that range, especially if accompanied by further RSI strength, could open the door for a broader trend reversal and a push toward the $2.75–$3.00 levels seen earlier in the year. Although XRP bulls aren’t fully back in control just yet, the RSI does suggest that momentum is tilting in their favor. All eyes now turn to whether buyers can convert that shift into a decisive price breakout.

In a recent post on X, the analyst declared, “XRP is about to make new all-time highs. Next stop is $10 and beyond,” sparking renewed excitement among traders. Accompanying his statement was a technical chart highlighting a breakout pattern that points toward sustained upward momentum. Technical Chart Supports Bullish Outlook The chart shared by XRP CAPTAIN shows XRP breaking through key resistance and continuing its climb with strength. Now trading at $2.26, the asset has firmly established bullish momentum. While XRP already traded above $3 earlier this year, the analyst believes the current setup suggests this move is different, positioning XRP to finally surpass its all-time high of $3.84 , set in January 2018. #XRP Is About To Make New All Time Highs Next Stop Is 10$ And Beyond. pic.twitter.com/MvDTpLnJWd — XRP CAPTAIN (@UniverseTwenty) June 8, 2025 The breakout structure is supported by rising volume, higher lows, and expanding volatility—all signals of an asset entering a fresh phase of acceleration. According to XRP CAPTAIN, the market is setting up for a long-anticipated move into price discovery, with $10 emerging as a plausible mid-term target. Growing Utility Fuels XRP’s Ascent XRP’s price action isn’t just driven by sentiment, it’s being reinforced by real-world developments that strengthen the token’s long-term fundamentals.

We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Recent innovations, particularly the launch of the XRPL EVM Sidechain, have positioned XRP to expand beyond payments into decentralized applications.

This expansion in utility is increasing demand for the asset, both from institutional users seeking reliable liquidity solutions and from a growing base of developers and investors building on XRPL’s evolving ecosystem.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-the-nft-wind-coming-back-nft-platform-opensea-reaches-its-last-2-year-high-in-transaction-volume-here-are-the-details/,"Leading NFT marketplace OpenSea saw its highest number of active users since mid-2023 last month, but trading volume remains well below previous market peaks. OpenSea Reaches Highest Number of Users Since 2023 According to Dune Analytics data, 467,322 users performed at least one transaction on OpenSea in May, similar to the platform’s peak period in mid-2022 – early 2023. June has already reached over 236,000 active users, suggesting continued momentum. However, trading volume is still far from the record levels of 2021 and early 2022. In May 2025, OpenSea recorded monthly trading volume of $81 million, well below the record volume of over $5 billion in January 2022. The increase in the number of active users is largely attributed to the official release of OpenSea’s new version, OS2, on May 29. The beta period was open only to Gemesis NFT holders (a collection of 94,757 NFTs mined in April 2023) and focused on testing the platform’s new features. The beta phase of OS2 started on January 27, 2025, and is now fully operational. With the new release, OpenSea users can now trade NFTs and tokens on 19 different blockchains, including Solana’s fungible tokens. The platform also announced a new rewards system called Voyages, which allows users to earn XP (experience points) based on their on-chain activities. Alongside these developments, there is also anticipation within the community of a possible airdrop of OpenSea’s native token, SEA. However, no official date has been announced yet. “I know you’re all asking ‘when is the TGE?’ (when will the token be released?),” said Adam Hollander, OpenSea CMO, “But we have a lot of surprises ahead of us, new launches and innovations. It’s very important to get these structures in place before we launch the token.” Although OpenSea's revival of its user base in this new era is noteworthy, it seems that the NFT market still needs time to bring its overall transaction volume back to previous levels. *This is not investment advice.

A significant announcement has come from one of South Korea’s major digital asset platforms. Upbit , a leading crypto exchange , has confirmed a temporary halt to certain operations involving the SEI token. This move is directly related to upcoming network enhancements for SEI . What Exactly is Happening with the Upbit SEI Suspension ? According to an official notice posted on its website, Upbit will be temporarily suspending deposits and withdrawals of the SEI token. This isn’t a permanent measure, but a necessary step to accommodate a scheduled network upgrade for SEI . The suspension is set to begin promptly at 09:00 UTC on June 10 . Here are the key details you need to know: Affected Token: SEI Exchange: Upbit Action: Temporary suspension of deposits and withdrawals Start Date/Time: June 10, 2024, at 09:00 UTC Reason: To support the upcoming SEI network upgrade It’s crucial to understand that while deposits and withdrawals are paused, trading of SEI pairs on Upbit is typically unaffected by such suspensions unless specifically stated otherwise in the announcement. However, users planning to move their SEI tokens onto or off the exchange around this date need to be aware of this scheduled downtime. Why is the SEI Network Upgrade Necessary? Network upgrades are a common and vital part of the lifecycle for many blockchain projects, including SEI . Think of it like software updates for your computer or phone – they are implemented to improve performance, enhance security features, fix bugs, or introduce new functionalities. For a blockchain network like SEI , an upgrade can involve significant changes to the underlying protocol. Reasons for a SEI network upgrade could include: Implementing new consensus mechanism improvements. Enhancing transaction speed or efficiency. Adding support for new features or smart contract capabilities. Strengthening network security against potential threats. Optimizing network performance and scalability. For a crypto exchange like Upbit , supporting such an upgrade involves ensuring their systems are compatible with the updated network. If they continued processing deposits and withdrawals during the upgrade, there could be risks of transactions being lost, incorrectly processed, or tokens being incompatible with the updated chain. Suspending services is a precautionary measure to protect user funds and maintain the integrity of the exchange’s operations with the SEI network. What Does This Mean for SEI Holders on Upbit ? If you hold SEI on Upbit and have no immediate plans to deposit or withdraw, this announcement might have minimal direct impact on your current holdings. Your tokens remain safely stored on the exchange. However, if you were planning to transfer SEI to or from your Upbit account around June 10th, you will need to adjust your plans. Any deposit initiated after the suspension begins may not be credited until the suspension is lifted, and withdrawal requests will likely be blocked. It’s important to note that the duration of the suspension is temporary. Upbit will typically monitor the SEI network upgrade progress and will resume deposit and withdrawal services once they are confident that the network is stable and their systems are fully compatible with the upgraded chain. They will issue a follow-up announcement when services are restored. Understanding the Role of a Crypto Exchange in Upgrades Major crypto exchange platforms like Upbit play a crucial role in the ecosystem. They act as gateways for users to buy, sell, and store digital assets. When a blockchain network undergoes a significant upgrade, exchanges must coordinate their activities to ensure a smooth transition. Their responsibilities during a network upgrade often include: Monitoring: Keeping a close watch on the upgrade process on the blockchain network. Preparation: Updating their node software and internal systems to be compatible with the new version of the network. Communication: Informing users about the upcoming changes and any service disruptions, such as the Upbit SEI suspension . User Fund Safety: Implementing temporary halts on deposits/withdrawals to prevent loss or errors during the transition. Post-Upgrade Verification: Thoroughly testing deposit and withdrawal functions after the upgrade is complete before resuming services. This proactive approach by exchanges helps maintain trust and security within the cryptocurrency space. The Upbit SEI suspension is a standard procedure designed with user protection in mind. Navigating the Upbit Suspension: Actionable Steps For SEI users on Upbit , the best course of action is to stay informed and plan ahead. Here are some tips: Check Official Sources: Always refer to the official Upbit website or announcement channels for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding the Upbit SEI suspension and its resumption. Plan Transfers: If you need to deposit or withdraw SEI around June 10th, try to complete these transactions well before the 09:00 UTC deadline. Set Reminders: Note the date and time of the suspension to avoid attempting transfers during the downtime. Be Patient: Understand that the suspension is temporary. Wait for Upbit to officially announce the resumption of services before attempting deposits or withdrawals again. Consider Alternatives (if necessary): If you absolutely must move SEI during the suspension period, you would need to explore other exchanges or wallets that might not be undergoing maintenance simultaneously, but this requires careful research and consideration. The SEI network upgrade is a positive sign for the project’s development, and the temporary suspension by Upbit is a standard operational procedure to ensure a smooth transition for users. Conclusion Upbit has announced a temporary halt to SEI deposits and withdrawals starting June 10th at 09:00 UTC. This measure is being taken to facilitate the upcoming SEI network upgrade . While this Upbit SEI suspension means users cannot move their SEI tokens onto or off the platform during this period, it is a necessary step undertaken by the crypto exchange to ensure the safety of user funds and compatibility with the updated network. Users are advised to plan their transactions accordingly and monitor official Upbit channels for updates on when services will be fully restored. This is a routine event in the crypto world, highlighting the ongoing development and maintenance required for blockchain networks.

Some are focusing on real use cases and tech features, while others are building media appeal. One name using publicity in a standout way is BlockDAG. Unlike many projects that rely on short-lived hype, BDAG is taking a steady PR route that’s hard to ignore. Its confirmed sponsorship with Inter Milan and a hinted NBA tie-up show that BlockDAG’s aim is much bigger than basic crypto promotions. These moves aren’t just for name recognition, they’re designed to reach wider audiences outside traditional crypto platforms. Among the best cryptos to buy now, BlockDAG is one of the few balancing tech growth with cultural engagement. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Biggest Crypto Presale of 2025 Few names in crypto are grabbing attention like BlockDAG (BDAG) . The Inter Milan partnership was a bold start, signaling a focus beyond crypto circles. Now, with hints of a future NBA connection, BlockDAG is reaching sports fans worldwide. This approach taps into two huge global audiences, giving BDAG more exposure than standard digital ads ever could. The crossover between sports fans and crypto users is strong. Both groups are tech-aware, social media-active, and quick to pick up trends. That’s why these sports deals aren’t just marketing, they show that BlockDAG is here to stay. These partnerships act as endorsements, helping BDAG gain support from both everyday users and major players in the space. The figures also back up the buzz. With more than 22.1 billion coins sold and $291 million already raised in its presale, BlockDAG is making big waves. It’s currently in stage 28 at $0.0262, but until June 13, its price has been slashed to just $0.0018. That’s a 2,678% ROI at the expected launch price of $0.05. Plus, over 1.5 million people are now using the X1 mining app. BlockDAG is doing more than just catching eyes, it’s building proof. 2. Cosmos (ATOM): Bridging Blockchains Seamlessly Cosmos remains one of the best cryptos to buy now due to its focus on connecting different blockchains. Its IBC protocol lets separate systems communicate smoothly, which is important as the need for multi-chain setups increases. Cosmos might not be doing sports deals like BlockDAG, but its technology is recognized in developer circles. Even without flashy partnerships, Cosmos maintains visibility through events, news, and technical updates. The brand remains consistent, focusing on a stable and scalable structure. That appeals to those building in the crypto space. Cosmos stays dependable by sticking to its original goal and improving what matters. 3. Sui (SUI): Powering Gaming & Finance SUI is winning attention with its speed and smooth user experience. Developed by a team from Meta, SUI started with high expectations and continues to impress. Its model for running many transactions at once makes it suitable for fast-paced platforms like games and finance apps. Rather than going for mass media attention, SUI builds its name through tech updates and trusted partnerships. Collaborations with metaverse and NFT projects gave it a push after launch. Though not as visible in mainstream circles as BlockDAG, SUI proves itself with real use and transparent progress. It’s one of the best cryptos to buy now for users who value function and trust. 4. SEI Network (SEI): Facilitating High-Speed Transactions SEI is gaining ground by fine-tuning its blockchain for high-speed trades. As a Layer 1 system built for DeFi, it focuses on fast action and low delays. It uses tools like order books that are key for crypto exchanges and serious trading apps. When it comes to getting attention, SEI chooses depth over flash. Its name is spreading thanks to technical performance, solid partnerships, and continued updates. Unlike BlockDAG’s wide media appeal, SEI earns its place through usefulness and community respect. It may not reach pop culture, but it holds a strong spot in crypto-focused spaces. Final Thoughts! In today’s race for visibility, smart promotion is a major edge. Cosmos, SUI, and SEI have built strong positions with solid performance and steady growth. But BlockDAG is doing something different, showing that when you mix strong features with smart media, you get wider impact. The Inter Milan move showed ambition. The NBA teaser proved follow-through. With $291 million raised, over 22.1 billion coins sold, and a chance to grab BDAG at $0.0018, BlockDAG clearly stands out among the best cryptos to buy now .

As of June 9, Bittensor price today is hovering near $402, marking a near 5% daily gain and challenging the 0.382 Fibonacci resistance at $397. This rebound comes after a multi-day pullback that tested support near the $354 level, aligning with the 0.5 Fib retracement. With both technical indicators and price structure improving, bulls appear poised to target higher levels if upside volume sustains. What’s Happening With Bittensor’s Price? TAO price dynamics (Source: TradingView) The short-term Bittensor price action shows clear signs of renewed strength. The 30-minute chart confirms a clean breakout from a compression zone formed over the past two sessions, with price pushing decisively above the $387–$390 supply block. Multiple timeframes now show TAO reclaiming lost ground, with the 4-hour Bollinger Bands expanding to support further movement and the price reclaiming the 20/50/100 EMAs, currently clustered between $379 and $400.

The number rose to levels previously only seen in early 2023, however its trading volume has remained low. According to data from Dune Analytics, the platform saw a 44% increase in its monthly active addresses compared to the previous month. In May 2025, the NFT marketplace saw 467,322 users who made one or more transactions. The last time the platform reached that many users was back in April 2023. In fact, June is already showing a similar pattern, with its current number already standing at 236,091 active users. The sudden surge in users could be attributed to the marketplace’s recent major update, OS2. Launched in May 2025, the platform upgrade enables traders to trading in both fungible and non-fungible tokens. Not only that, the upgrade also removes the need to bridge or swap tokens. You might also like: Yuga Labs CEO wants to ‘kill the ApeCoin DAO’ and launch a new entity Despite the jump in active addresses, the data shows that it has barely made a difference to the platform’s trading volume. According to Dune analytics, OpenSea’s monthly trading volume for May is still at $81 million, only jumping by $21 million from the previous month’s $60 million trading volume. The number remains far below the platform’s previous highs back in $5 billion back in early 2022. Even in June, the trading volume has not seen signs of a revival, considering it has barely managed to reflect the active address increase. As of June 6, the trading volume stands at $24 million. Ever since the NFT market began declining in 2022, many traders have begun to question whether NFTs are still relevant. Major NFT firms like Yuga Labs has chosen to sell their staple NFT brands, such as CryptoPunks and Moonbirds to other firms. Initially, OpenSea hoped the OS2 update would boost NFT trading on the marketplace, reviving the NFT trade. However at press time, it has not shown signs of definite success yet.

Yet, the iPhone manufacturer claims that large language models are “failing” because they are focused more on benchmarks than solving problems. Over the weekend, a research paper circulated on social media from Apple’s AI research division that “downplayed” the capabilities of reasoning models developed by OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic, and DeepSeek. According to the paper , these models have declined in accuracy against the backdrop of an increase in task complexity, ultimately reaching a “point of complete failure.” “Existing evaluations predominantly focus on established mathematical and coding benchmarks, which, while valuable, often suffer from data contamination issues and do not allow for controlled experimental conditions across different settings and complexities. These evaluations do not provide insights into the structure and quality of reasoning traces ,” it read. AI is failing when problems are harder Using custom-designed puzzles with controlled levels of complexity, Apple researchers observed that large AI models failed to keep up performances and exerted less effort as problems grew harder. The analysts, who measured the reduction by fewer inference-time tokens used during response generation, called the AI situation a “collapse.” The models tested included OpenAI’s o3-mini variant and Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet. The o3-mini models performed “poorly,” while Claude models were slightly resilient. Even when provided with the correct algorithm for solving the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, the models did not improve their performance. Apple’s researchers concluded that these AI systems may not be as advanced in reasoning as commonly assumed.. WWDC kicks off pending any product announcement buzz In previous WWDC events, Apple used the conference to unveil new products, like the Vision Pro headset in 2022 and its Apple Intelligence initiative in 2023. In this year’s conference, market watchers are convinced there is nothing to look forward to. Bloomberg has previewed the WWDC schedule , coining the updates as “underwhelming.” Moreover, much of what Apple revealed last year is still unavailable to users. The publication explained that Apple’s AI announcements this week would likely be minor and insufficient to impress an industry now led by Google, Meta, OpenAI, and other AI-first firms. Apple’s stock has dropped over 18% in 2025, and CEO Tim Cook has been blasted about the company’s new products and AI integration pipeline. Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, told CNN earlier this year that “it’s becoming clearer how far behind Apple are in AI.” Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities estimates that 25% of the global population could eventually access AI through Apple devices, but as of now, that “potential is unrealized.” In its earnings call last month, CEO Tim Cook admitted that there were delays in rolling out improved AI features such as a more personal version of Siri. “ We need more time to complete our work on these features so they meet our high quality bar ,” Cook said. “ We are making progress, and we look forward to getting these features into customers’ hands. ” Meanwhile, Apple’s competitors are dipping into the tech giant’s clientele, looking to steal loyalists who have been expecting Cook’s team to deliver something “better.” Samsung is reportedly partnering with AI startup Perplexity to integrate AI-enhanced digital assistants into upcoming Galaxy phones. Motorola’s new Razr also includes Perplexity-powered features, among other AI integrations. Apple’s delay in launching AI-powered experiences in its ecosystem puts it at risk of falling behind in a market it once dominated. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The medical device company closed Friday’s session up 205% at $1.56 and is now up 213% over the past week. That momentum hasn’t slowed, with shares soaring another 100% in Monday’s pre-market trading to $3.13. KNW one-day stock price chart. Source: Google Finance The rally is fueling the announcement that Goldeneye 1995 LLC, an investment vehicle tied to Greg Kidd, former chief risk officer at Ripple, is acquiring a controlling stake in Know Labs using 1,000 Bitcoin and additional cash. At current prices, the Bitcoin component alone is worth over $105 million. Particulars of Know Labs acquisition Under the terms of the deal, Goldeneye will purchase common stock by dividing the total value of the 1,000 Bitcoin by Know Labs’ share price at the time of the agreement—$0.335. This structure significantly increases Goldeneye’s equity stake in the company. At the same time, Know Labs plans to retain Bitcoin as part of its treasury reserves, exposing investors to the digital currency . Once the acquisition is finalized, Kidd will take over as CEO and also assume the role of chairman of the board. “I’m thrilled to deploy a Bitcoin treasury strategy with the support of a forward-looking organization like Know Labs at a time when market and regulatory conditions are particularly favorable. We believe this approach will generate sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value,” Kidd said. Notably, the Seattle-based company specializes in noninvasive health monitoring technology . Its flagship product in development, KnowU, is a wearable, continuous glucose monitor that helps people with diabetes manage their blood sugar without needles. The device can be worn on the wrist, forearm, or as an adhesive patch with a removable sensor, offering a discreet and convenient alternative to traditional glucose testing.

If you’re dealing with Stratis (STRAX) on Binance, there’s an important announcement you need to be aware of. The global crypto exchange giant, Binance, has informed its users about a temporary halt on Binance Stratis suspension activities. According to an official notice posted on their website, Binance will be suspending deposits and withdrawals for tokens operating on the Stratis (STRAX) network. This temporary measure is scheduled to begin on June 11, 2024, at 10:00 AM UTC. The reason behind this planned downtime is to support the upcoming STRAX network upgrade and hard fork. Why is This Binance Stratis Suspension Happening? Network upgrades and hard forks are significant events in the life of a blockchain. They are often implemented to introduce new features, improve performance, enhance security, or fix existing issues. In the case of the Stratis hard fork , it signifies a substantial change to the network’s protocol that is not backward-compatible with older versions. For a major exchange like Binance, supporting such an event involves a careful process. They need to ensure that their systems are compatible with the new network rules after the hard fork occurs. Suspending Binance STRAX deposits and withdrawals is a standard procedure to prevent potential issues that could arise from transactions being initiated on the old network version while the new one is being implemented or immediately afterward. This safeguards user funds and ensures a smooth transition once the upgrade is complete. What Does This Mean for STRAX Holders on Binance? If you currently hold STRAX tokens in your Binance account, generally, you don’t need to take any immediate action regarding the upgrade itself. Binance typically handles all the technical requirements for users holding tokens on the exchange during standard network upgrades and hard forks that don’t involve a token swap. However, the suspension of crypto deposit withdrawal services for STRAX means you will not be able to move your Stratis tokens onto or off the exchange during the specified period. This is the key actionable insight for users: If you need to deposit STRAX to Binance, make sure it arrives before the June 11, 10:00 AM UTC deadline. If you need to withdraw STRAX from Binance, complete the withdrawal before the same deadline. Transactions attempted after the suspension begins will likely be rejected or might not be credited properly once services resume, leading to potential loss of funds. Trading of STRAX on Binance is generally not affected by deposit and withdrawal suspensions related to network upgrades, unless explicitly stated otherwise by the exchange. Users can typically continue to trade STRAX pairs on the spot or derivatives markets as usual. Understanding Network Upgrades and Hard Forks To appreciate why this temporary Binance Stratis suspension is necessary, it helps to understand the underlying technology: Network Upgrade: This is a change to the blockchain’s protocol. It’s like updating the operating system of a computer network. Hard Fork: A type of network upgrade that creates a permanent divergence from the previous version of the blockchain. Nodes running the old software will not be able to validate blocks created by nodes running the new software. For the network to continue as a single chain, the majority of participants (especially miners/validators and exchanges) must adopt the new software. Why Suspension? During the transition period, there’s a risk of transactions being broadcast on the old chain or issues arising from the split. Exchanges suspend deposits/withdrawals to prevent users from losing funds by sending them to addresses that might become invalid or by having transactions stuck between the old and new chain versions. This specific STRAX network upgrade aims to bring improvements to the Stratis platform, potentially enhancing its capabilities for decentralized applications, smart contracts, or overall efficiency. The exact details of the upgrade would be available through Stratis’s official communication channels. When Will Services Resume? Binance’s announcement typically states that the suspension is temporary and in support of the upgrade. They will reopen Binance STRAX deposits and withdrawals once they are confident that the Stratis network is stable after the hard fork and their systems have been successfully updated and tested. The exact time for the resumption of services is usually announced separately after the upgrade is completed. Users should monitor Binance’s official announcements for updates on when they can resume their crypto deposit withdrawal activities for STRAX. Staying Informed is Key For any cryptocurrency user, especially those holding or trading altcoins like STRAX, staying informed about network developments and exchange announcements is crucial. Events like the Stratis hard fork and the subsequent Binance Stratis suspension can impact your ability to manage your assets. By paying attention to these notices, you can plan your deposits and withdrawals accordingly, avoiding potential inconvenience or loss of access to your funds during the upgrade period. Binance provides these notices well in advance to give users ample time to prepare. In Conclusion Binance’s temporary suspension of Stratis (STRAX) deposits and withdrawals on June 11, 2024, is a necessary step to support the upcoming STRAX network upgrade and hard fork. This action ensures the security and integrity of user funds during a significant protocol change on the Stratis blockchain.

Many are predicting that with rising optimistic factors for the market, soon the top crypto and altcoins are predicted to experience significant movement this week. Several altcoins are showing promising upside potential. Keep reading to know what our top choices are this week. Why This Week Is Bullish For Altcoins? Due to the Trump-Musk feud and ongoing tariff uncertainty, June was a mildly bearish week. But, the recent positive US jobs report and restart of US-China tariffs talks have given a slight charm from June 6th onwards, as a result, Bitcoin price has advanced nearly 5%. More to it, Russia-Ukraine chaos is driving safe-haven demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The improved opinions have created high hopes in the sector. Even companies like Circle, one of the largest stablecoin issuers,is growing one step higher with recently raised $1.1 billion via an IPO , and Reuters recently highlighted that adoption could see a fast track with the UK to lift bans on crypto ETNs . Several factors boosted the sentiment, and now high standards have been raised further for the upcoming week in the crypto sector. Importantly, the upcoming U.S. consumer inflation data scheduled for Wednesday, June 11, 2025, will have an impact on BTC and most altcoins if it is only lower-than-expected. If it comes in favour, then the probability of reaching $112,000 or more could advance. A breakout could lift the broader market, including altcoins like Hyperliquid (HYPE), Binance Coin (BNB), and Sui (SUI). These three altcoins are to watch this weekend. Top Alt’s Prediction This Week – HYPE, BNB, SUI Hyperliquid token (HYPE) has gained 11% this week, and the momentum is expected to continue this week. The main reason for its growth was the recent listing on the Binance exchange. Now, if more optimistic factors join the market, then this week the HYPE price is set to surpass its ATH of $39.93 and could end the Q2 2025 beyond $50, with a symmetrical triangle breakout. Similarly, another altcoin is BNB, Binance’s native token, and Binance is one of the best-performing CEXs globally, despite being in an era of the toughest regulatory pressures. Its token BNB price is up 4% this week, currently selling on exchanges at $655. With a solid market cap of $92.21 billion and growing ecosystem demand, BNB price could close the week by surpassing the Q2 high of $697 and reach $700. Source: TradingView Moreover, SUI, which is known as high-speed blockchain, is our third pick for this week. The investors’ consistent market interest makes it an altcoin that could show a strong spike this week. In Q2, it reached a high of $4.29, but if this week plays optimistically, then the SUI price could reach higher levels and could close the Q2 2025 above $4.29 . .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Nevertheless, further consolidation and a deeper correction might be on the way for the cryptocurrency. ETH Price Analysis: Technicals By Shayan Markets The Daily Chart Ethereum has once again faced rejection at the critical 200-day moving average near $2.6K, reflecting persistent selling pressure and a lack of bullish momentum. This prolonged consolidation below the 200-day MA signals buyer exhaustion and increases the likelihood of a deeper correction. The price remains trapped between the 100-day MA at $2K and the 200-day MA at $2.6K, forming a mid-term range. Given the current weakness, a decline toward the range’s lower boundary appears plausible. However, if bulls manage to reclaim the 200-day MA, a rapid short-squeeze could propel the price toward the $3K resistance zone. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Ethereum continues to oscillate within a rising wedge pattern, typically a bearish formation. The recent rejection from the upper boundary around $2.6K confirms seller dominance, with price now hovering near the wedge’s lower edge. A breakdown from this level would likely initiate a bearish continuation toward the $2.2K support area. Until a decisive breakout occurs, price action is expected to remain choppy within the wedge. Source: TradingView ETH Price: Sentiment Analysis By Shayan Markets Ethereum remains range-bound just below a key resistance level, leaving investors uncertain about the potential for an imminent bullish breakout. A critical metric to watch is the ETH Taker Buy-Sell Ratio, which tracks the dominance of aggressive market orders, those executed at the current market price, revealing whether buyers or sellers are driving momentum. These orders typically indicate urgency and conviction among traders. Lately, the 30-day moving average of this ratio has been trending downward, signalling a rise in aggressive selling. This shift points to growing bearish pressure, with profit-taking and distribution likely increasing as Ethereum struggles to overcome resistance. If this selling trend continues, it may lead to a deeper correction, with the $2,200 level emerging as a key support. However, if the recent selling is primarily driven by short-term traders or so-called “weak hands,” it could mark a healthy consolidation phase, potentially setting the stage for a renewed bullish breakout. In summary, Ethereum’s next major move will largely depend on whether the current selling pressure escalates or fades amid underlying mid-term demand.

It shows bullish signs, but there’s currently not enough volume in the market. Ending the month of May on a bearish note due to a broad correction across the crypto space, SUI started this month very weak and lost more ground. Surprisingly, the bulls reacted strongly to the bearish move and intercepted further drops above the $2.8 level during last week’s trading. Holding this level as temporal support, the price bounced back following a sudden increase in the demand level, and the crypto traded back above $3. Despite the bounce, it is important to note that the price is still under correction on the daily chart. Considering that, it is too early to say the bulls are back in action. But from a technical standpoint, they are much more likely to regain control anytime soon. A significant increase above the previous monthly high should bring them fully back into the market with a potential break-up. That said, the trading landscape has changed briefly over the past few days, and as we can see on the daily chart, it is showing signs of a shift on the daily chart. If the price slides back to support, a break there could cause more drawdowns before finding a solid rebound level. SUI Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Pushing higher from the current trading level, it may climb back above the $3.75 and $4.25 resistance levels. A surge through these levels could bring a full recovery to $5 and $5.5. before exploding to a new high. The latest recovery is supported by the $2.83 level. A drop off this level could correct the price lower to $2.42 and potentially $2.02 in no time.

CEO Jensen Huang said that the UK’s artificial intelligence talent is an “envy of the world. Huang noted that while the UK boasts world-class researchers and scientists, the absence of robust computing resources hinders the nation’s ability to lead in the AI sector. During a talk with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the beginning of London Tech Week, Huang mentioned that the UK is in a Goldilocks situation . This means that it is a perfect time for AI companies to succeed. The CEO urged substantial investment in foundational infrastructure to support the growing AI ecosystem. He added that this is the biggest global AI ecosystem that lacks its own infrastructure. The UK embraces AI for economic growth and staying competitive For AI systems to operate smoothly, they need good data, strong hardware, safe systems, and ongoing checks and improvements. Setting clear goals, tackling possible biases, and encouraging flexibility to use AI successfully are also important. For instance, to power generative tools such as ChatGPT, AI models need an enormous amount of computing from massive data centers to build and process millions of queries from users around the globe. The data centers require abundant electricity , water, and other infrastructure. In recognition of this requirement, Starmer said on Monday , June 9, that his party would commit an extra £1 billion, worth $1.4 billion of funding. This will be used to scale up their computing power by a factor of 20 and increase infrastructure for building artificial intelligence in the UK. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority also announced the same day that it is setting up a so-called regulatory sandbox to allow financial firms to experiment with AI using Nvidia’s technology. These sandboxes enable companies with new ideas at the crossroads between finance and technology to test products and services before fully launching them. Liquidity, a start-up lender, will also set up a European head office in London and has decided to invest £1.5 billion in companies over the next five years. Earlier, the government partnered with Nvidia to train more people in AI skills and expand research. All this effort ensures that the UK solidifies its position in the AI ecosystem as demand for AI skyrockets. According to data from reliable sources, today, over 70 countries have put AI strategies and policies in place that describe various ways to build a strong AI ecosystem. This variety of strategies is encouraging because it shows that many people understand how important AI will likely become for economic growth and staying competitive. UK still presents opportunity for AI despite lagging behind in the sector The US and China have been leading the way in reproducing groundbreaking generative AI companies. America is often seen as a leader in generative AI development, especially in the quality and abilities of its models. China has also made great progress in generative AI, with major companies like Baidu and Alibaba taking the lead. The way the US develops AI mainly depends on teamwork between companies and researchers using open-source resources. Companies in the US include Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft, which create advanced generative AI models. Meanwhile, China concentrates on generative AI for real-world applications, taking advantage of its big domestic market. Contrastingly, Europe has lagged behind. Europe still does not have anywhere near as much data center development as its rivals. Despite this, Huang is nursing hope in Europe. He acknowledged that what is really impressive and presents a great opportunity for the UK is that AI is not just a technology. Based on his argument, AI acts as infrastructure because it affects many industries simultaneously. Huang further stated that since this technology is extensive and transforms every sector, it will be viewed as a vital infrastructure, similar to electricity. The CEO is touring Europe this week. He hinted that many AI factories are being planned in the area. Huang is also expected to speak at Paris’s VivaTech and meet leaders in the UK, Germany, France, and Belgium this week.

A recent notable event caught the eye of market observers: a significant Bitcoin transfer involving two prominent firms, Jump Crypto and Galaxy Digital. Understanding the Jump Crypto and Galaxy Digital Transfer According to on-chain data shared by The Data Nerd on X, Jump Crypto , the digital asset arm of the renowned trading firm Jump Trading Group, recently transferred a substantial amount of Bitcoin to Galaxy Digital , the financial services and investment management firm founded by Mike Novogratz. Let’s break down the details: Approximately two hours prior to the report, 501 BTC were moved from a wallet associated with Jump Crypto to one linked to Galaxy Digital. At the time of the transfer, this 501 BTC was valued at roughly $53 million. This wasn’t an isolated event. Over the three days leading up to the report, Galaxy Digital had accumulated a total of 1,001 BTC from Jump Crypto. The cumulative value of these transfers over the three days amounted to approximately $105.32 million. This series of transactions highlights the active relationship and potential operational needs between these major institutional entities within the crypto ecosystem. Why Are These Institutional Bitcoin Transfers Significant? When large players like Jump Crypto and Galaxy Digital move substantial amounts of cryptocurrency, it’s rarely arbitrary. These movements can offer insights into their strategies, market outlook, or operational requirements. Tracking such on-chain activity is a key part of understanding the institutional landscape in crypto. Potential reasons behind large institutional Bitcoin transfer events include: Over-the-Counter (OTC) Trading: Firms often conduct large trades off public exchanges to minimize market impact. One party might transfer assets to another as part of a pre-arranged OTC deal. Custody Solutions: Galaxy Digital offers custody services. Jump Crypto might be moving assets into Galaxy’s custody for secure storage or management. Liquidity Management: Assets might be moved between wallets or entities for various liquidity needs, such as preparing for trading activities, meeting client demands, or rebalancing portfolios. Strategic Positioning: Accumulation or distribution of assets could signal a firm’s bullish or bearish stance, although a single transfer doesn’t provide the full picture. Internal Transfers: While less likely between two distinct major firms unless part of a partnership or service agreement, sometimes large movements are simply internal restructuring. Without direct confirmation from the firms, the exact reason for this specific Jump Crypto to Galaxy Digital transfer remains speculative, but the volume indicates a purposeful action. Galaxy Digital’s Growing Bitcoin Holdings: A Closer Look The report also shed light on Galaxy Digital’s current Institutional Bitcoin holdings. Following the accumulation of 1,001 BTC from Jump Crypto over three days, Galaxy Digital’s reported wallet now holds a total of 4,377 BTC. At the time of the report, this impressive holding was valued at approximately $462.37 million. This substantial holding underscores Galaxy Digital’s significant presence in the Bitcoin market. As a firm heavily involved in cryptocurrency investment management and financial services, maintaining a large reserve of BTC is likely integral to their business model, supporting trading operations, investment products, and potentially balance sheet holdings. Comparing the figures: Transaction/Holding Amount (BTC) Approximate Value (USD) Recent Transfer (Single) 501 $53 million Transferred over 3 Days (Total) 1,001 $105.32 million Galaxy Digital’s Reported Total Holding 4,377 $462.37 million These figures illustrate the scale at which institutional players like Galaxy Digital operate within the crypto trading and investment space. What Can We Learn from Institutional Crypto Trading Activity? Observing the movements of large players like Jump Crypto and Galaxy Digital offers valuable insights for anyone interested in the cryptocurrency market. While not direct trading signals, they highlight the increasing maturity and institutional adoption of digital assets. Key takeaways often include: Confirmation of active institutional participation. Indications of potential supply/demand dynamics forming off-exchange. Understanding the relationships and flow of assets between major market participants. Contextualizing market volatility – sometimes large moves are operational, not purely directional bets. Tracking wallets associated with known institutional players, like the one holding Galaxy Digital’s reported balance, is a common practice for analysts trying to gauge institutional sentiment and activity levels in Institutional Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Challenges and Considerations While tracking institutional flows is informative, it’s not without challenges. Wallet attribution isn’t always definitive, and the exact purpose of a transfer is rarely publicly disclosed. Furthermore, large players can execute complex strategies involving multiple wallets and entities, making it difficult to piece together the full picture from on-chain data alone. There are also considerations around market impact and transparency. Large OTC deals, while necessary for volume, can sometimes make price discovery on public exchanges less efficient in the short term. Regulatory scrutiny on large transfers and institutional activity is also an ongoing factor in the market. Conclusion: The Pulse of Institutional Crypto The recent substantial Bitcoin transfer from Jump Crypto to Galaxy Digital is more than just a transaction; it’s a snapshot of the dynamic and rapidly evolving institutional crypto landscape. It underscores the significant capital and assets being managed and moved by major financial players. With over $105 million in BTC transferred over three days and Galaxy Digital now holding a reported $462 million in Bitcoin in one wallet, the scale of operations among these firms is clear. Whether these transfers are for trading, custody, or other strategic reasons, they are a testament to the growing integration of Bitcoin and other digital assets into traditional finance structures and sophisticated crypto trading strategies. Keeping an eye on these large institutional movements remains a crucial way to understand the undercurrents shaping the cryptocurrency market and the increasing adoption of Institutional Bitcoin .

On the one hand, Pi Network (PI) experienced a steep price collapse over the past few months, but the optimism is fanned by speculation of a potential Binance listing . While the Pi Core Team remains silent and Binance has made no formal announcement, blockchain sleuths have spotted significant test activity from a Binance-linked Stellar wallet on the Pi Chain. This has sparked a wave of rumors among the PI community. Meanwhile, XYZVerse is gaining traction with a viral presale and a sports-meets-meme coin narrative that’s pulling in millions. This article breaks down the outlook for both—one struggling to reclaim relevance, the other racing toward a high-profile launch. From $3 to $0.60: PI Price Crashes 80% Since peaking at nearly $3 in February 2025, Pi (PI) has plunged over 80%, now hovering just above $0.60. The sharp decline stems from several challenges: delays in mainnet migration, unmet milestones (with only ~8 million of 10 million required users having migrated), and waning public interest. Google search trends for Pi have hit yearly lows, and IOU-based PI trading volume has dropped 97% since mid-May. Bearish technical indicators have reinforced the downtrend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains firmly in bearish territory, and many analysts expect a potential slide to $0.50 or even $0.40 if $0.60 fails to hold. Binance Listing Rumors Ignite a Price Rebound Amid the gloom, a beacon of bullish hope has emerged. Several crypto watchers on X (formerly Twitter) reported that a wallet associated with Binance had initiated test transactions on the Pi Chain. These observations coincide with an ecosystem update scheduled by Pi Network for May 14 — adding fuel to speculation that a listing on Binance could be imminent. In response to the rumors, PI’s price rebounded sharply, surging over 20% in just a few days and testing the $0.75 resistance level. This upward movement has renewed optimism that a breakout could be underway. What the Charts Say: Breakout or Breakdown? Technical analysts are watching the $0.75 level closely. If PI can decisively break above it, upside targets of $0.82 and $1.15 are within range, especially if news of a Binance debut materializes. A listing on Binance — one of the world's largest and most liquid crypto exchanges — could inject massive volume and credibility into the project. However, if the $0.75 barrier holds and the rumors prove unfounded, PI could slip back toward $0.60 or even lower. The extended lack of transparency from the Pi Core Team, combined with mounting token supply and delayed mainnet progression, makes this a high-risk zone. Pi Network Price Prediction 2025 Assuming a successful Binance listing and progress toward full mainnet migration, PI could reclaim its previous highs, potentially ranging between $1.20 to $1.80 in 2025. In a more conservative scenario, if delays continue and no major exchange listings are confirmed, a range of $0.40 to $0.65 seems more realistic. Source: TradingView That said, Pi Network remains a highly speculative asset. The ecosystem is still evolving, and its off-chain IOU status leaves room for uncertainty. Investors should weigh the potential rewards against the risks of an opaque project with limited market access — at least for now. XYZVerse Price Prediction: Can XYZ Become the Next Meme Coin Titan? As Pi Network captures the attention of cautious investors with rumors of a Binance debut, another contender is rapidly building momentum. XYZVerse is turning heads with a unique mix of sports adrenaline and meme-fueled virality. XYZVerse Raises Over $14M in Viral Presale XYZVerse ($XYZ) is a new meme coin phenomenon that’s blending the passion of sports with the power of community-driven crypto hype. The project has already raised over $14 million in its presale which they have recently announced on their X profile. This achievement speaks to the market’s appetite for meme coins with real cultural hooks. While countless meme tokens rise and fall on little more than fleeting trends, XYZVerse is built on a more robust foundation. Branded as the first all-sports meme coin, XYZ unites fans from football, MMA, and beyond, creating a cross-sport digital fanbase with massive potential. What Makes XYZ Different? Unlike typical meme coins, XYZ is not just about laughs and lingo — it’s about sustainable growth and community engagement. Here’s how: Revenue Mechanics: XYZVerse uses community-driven revenue to power regular buybacks and token burns, helping support price stability. Gamified Features: The roadmap includes play-to-earn mechanics, sports-themed minigames, and ecosystem utilities — all powered by $XYZ. New Character, New Identity: The recent website refresh introduced XYZepe, a bold mascot determined to take XYZ to the top of CoinMarketCap. In the often-hype-driven world of crypto, XYZVerse’s mix of entertainment, sports loyalty, and token utility offers a refreshing — and potentially explosive — combination. Presale Update: Nearly 95% of Stage 12 Sold Out The clock is ticking. With just five stages left before $XYZ hits the open market, savvy investors are rushing to secure tokens at deep discounts. Current Price: $0.003333 Next Stage Price: $0.005 Final Presale Price: $0.02 The numbers speak for themselves: momentum is building fast, and early supporters could see significant upside if the launch mirrors the success of other breakout meme coins. From the current price, the potential ROI stands at approximately 3000%. Join XYZVerse Presale for Potential 3000% ROI Earn While You Promote: Ambassador Airdrop Program XYZVerse is also rewarding its early backers through the Ambassador Airdrop Program, where fans can earn $XYZ by promoting the project creatively — from social media content to memes and more. This grassroots marketing initiative is helping spread the XYZ message like wildfire — and it’s paying off. Final Thoughts: A Meme Coin With Substance? Pi Network and XYZVerse reflect two sides of the altcoin market in 2025—one recovering from collapse, the other rising fast. Pi’s 80% drop shows what delayed execution and unclear communication can do. It’s still speculative. A Binance listing could lift it to $1.20–$1.80, but without that, it risks staying between $0.40–$0.65. XYZVerse, in contrast, is accelerating. With over $14 million raised and only a few presale stages left, its path is clear. Strong branding, a sports-driven angle, and smart tokenomics give it breakout potential. From its current price, the projected upside—up to 3000%—puts it firmly on the radar. Altcoin price prediction 2025 favors agility and narrative. Pi is waiting for confirmation. XYZ is already in motion.

This has created a recovery path from the Thursday flash crash. However, this optimism is forecasted to have a short life, as the big shot cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple’s XRP are at a grave risk this week that could display similar movements like Thursday, June 5th. These outcomes are forecasted as the US-China trade talks on Monday in London, which is seen as a highly volatile catalyst, with the potential to cause sharp movements. Another most critical factor to watch is Wednesday’s CPI data , which is crucial for market sentiment. A Bloomberg survey suggests that inflation likely spiked in May due to tariffs. If the report shows a higher-than-expected number, it could trigger a bearish move, dampening crypto market sentiment by indicating a slowdown in consumer spending. Conversely, if the CPI comes in lower than expected, it could lead to significant gains for top cryptocurrencies and altcoins. Is $112K Coming In Bitcoin Price This Week? The Bitcoin price is exchanging hands at $107663, and it is recovering after it took support from the dynamic 50-day EMA band. It has broken the short-term declining trendline and is headed straight for the $112K mark. If the momentum continues and upcoming US CPI reports join in favour, then an ATH could be on its plate. Many experts are hoping for inflation to print soft, as the ongoing momentum looks strong and seems Bitcoin is not done yet. However, the platform Truflation highlights that inflation may be picking up, as in May it began with 1.35% and by month end it was 2.06%. If CPI prints similar to what the data’s are projecting, then the ongoing momentum could be short-lived and could risk falling around $100K or even to $95K. Additionally, on-chain data revealed a concerning trend: the Small wallets, holding up to 1 BTC, have been accumulating strongly. Historically, when the “small fish” holders buy with conviction, it often hints that whales could be preparing to sell into that liquidity. This retail fomo is considered by many as a fatal warning sign that a sell-off could be on its way. How XRP And ETH are Expected To Perform This Week? In the last three days, the Bitcoin price advancement has boosted altcoin’s prices too. Even XRP and Ethereum have risen 8% and 6% respectively. However, the gains are not enough to clear their bounded range; the XRP and ETH prices are facing key hurdles. If the CPI comes higher, then a fall in both altcoin prices seems likely, but if CPI comes soft then it could be a short-term catalyst to clear their nearest hurdles. If XRP price manages to rise, then $2.65 is this week’s target, and for Ethereum price , it is at $3066. On the downside, XRP could fall to $1.80, and ETH towards $2000, respectively. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Kaanch Network is a real world asset tokenization and advanced blockchain infrastructure platform that makes a compelling case for anyone looking to take advantage of the growing demand for scalable, utility driven platforms. The presale is now in its sixth stage, and offers an entry point at $0.32 per token, with the next stage set to double the price to $0.64, indicating a shrinking window for early participation. Why Savvy Investors Are Watching Kaanch In 2025, the cryptocurrency market is more and more about projects that provide tangible utility and scalability. What makes Kaanch Network unique is its unique way of tokenizing real world assets like gold, real estate, and other high value commodities. The technical foundation of the project is strong and the project is aligned with the market trends toward asset backed digital solutions and analysts predict a potential 2800% surge in value post launch. With the project soon to be listed on BitMart at a fixed price of $30 per token, it’s no wonder that this is a project that investors are looking to get in on for high growth. Advanced Infrastructure for Real-World Applications Kaanch Network’s blockchain is built to be the fastest and most scalable, capable of processing 1.4 million transactions per second (TPS) with a finality of 0.8 seconds. This makes for instant trade execution and smart contract operations without a hitch, making Kaanch the most efficient. With near zero gas fees, it is a cost effective solution for decentralized applications (dApps), microtransactions and everyday payments, solving a major pain point in the current blockchain ecosystems. The platform is supported by 3,600 decentralized nodes that guarantee secure and reliable transactions for both businesses and individuals, especially in the tokenization of real world assets such as gold. Community-Driven Governance and Staking Rewards Kaanch’s community driven model is unique in that it provides open governance through a staking dashboard that allows token holders to vote on protocol updates and development. The project’s tokenomics is built with a fixed supply of 58 million tokens, which makes it scarce and increases its value proposition. The presale investors can stake their tokens right away, and earn up to 30% annual percentage yield (APY), which is a great incentive for early adopters. The presale is also inclusive for a wide range of investors as they can purchase tokens with ETH or USDT. Security and Transparency Backed by Audits Kaanch Network is built with security at its core with its smart contracts audited by reputable firms SpyWolf and VerifyLab. These audits prove the reliability and transparency of the platform, which is a trust factor for institutional and retail investors. Its enterprise- and developer-friendly architecture makes it easy to integrate with major blockchains such as Ethereum, Solana and BNB Chain, making it a good choice for building scalable decentralized applications. Kaanch is a versatile solution for regulated DeFi and tokenized infrastructure projects thanks to this interoperability. Last Chance to Join the Presale Before BitMart Listing Kaanch Network is in stage 6 of its presale and has raised over $1.9 million so far, indicating a positive investor sentiment. The next stage of the token price is $0.64, which is a critical moment for participation before the price doubles. A Bitmart listing is expected to come soon, late June 2025 at $30 per token, which will generate a lot of liquidity and market visibility. If you are an investor interested in this project, you should go to the Kaanch presale website and buy into the fast moving presale to secure your allocation before the public market launch. In conclusion, Kaanch Network’s presale represents a strategic opportunity for investors seeking exposure to a high-utility blockchain with strong fundamentals. Its focus on real-world asset tokenization, combined with its scalable infrastructure and community-driven governance, positions it as a standout project in 2025. With the presale nearing its final stages and the BitMart listing approaching, now is the time for savvy investors to act.

Navigating the often wild waves of the cryptocurrency market, especially when it comes to derivatives like BTC perpetual futures , requires more than just watching price charts. Understanding the underlying market sentiment – who’s betting on the price going up (long) and who’s betting on it going down (short) – is absolutely crucial. That’s where the long short ratio comes into play. This little metric can offer a powerful glimpse into the collective mindset of traders across major exchanges. Are traders feeling bullish and piling into long positions, or is fear creeping in, leading to more short bets? Let’s dive into the latest crypto futures data and see what the 24-hour long-short ratios for BTC perpetual futures are telling us right now. Understanding the Long Short Ratio in Crypto Before we look at the numbers, let’s quickly break down what the long short ratio actually represents. In simple terms, it’s the ratio of the total number of long positions versus the total number of short positions currently open on a specific asset, like Bitcoin (BTC), on a given exchange or across multiple exchanges. A ratio above 1 indicates that there are more long positions than short positions. This suggests a generally bullish sentiment among traders. A ratio below 1 indicates that there are more short positions than long positions. This points towards a more bearish sentiment. A ratio close to 1 (or 50% Long / 50% Short) suggests a relatively neutral or undecided market sentiment. It’s a key indicator that many traders use to gauge the prevailing Bitcoin trading sentiment in the derivatives market. Latest Crypto Futures Data : What Does it Tell Us? Looking at the 24-hour data for BTC perpetual futures across several prominent exchanges, we can see a slight lean towards the long side, but overall, the market appears quite balanced. Here’s a snapshot of the long-short ratios: Exchange/Total Long Positions Short Positions Total (Across Measured Exchanges) 51.07% 48.93% Binance 52.10% 47.90% Bybit 50.01% 49.99% Gate.io 50.52% 49.48% As you can see from this crypto futures data , the total ratio sits just above 51% long. This suggests that, on aggregate over the past day, slightly more traders were positioned for a price increase than a decrease. However, being so close to 50/50 indicates a relatively neutral stance overall, or perhaps a market lacking strong conviction in either direction at this exact moment. Interpreting Bitcoin Trading Sentiment from the Ratio How should we interpret this specific long short ratio data in terms of Bitcoin trading sentiment ? The key takeaway is balance, with a minor bullish tilt. Here are a few points to consider: Slight Long Bias: The fact that longs slightly outweigh shorts suggests a marginal preference for upward price movement among futures traders. Lack of Extreme Conviction: A ratio significantly skewed (e.g., 60%+ long or short) would indicate strong sentiment. The current numbers, being so close to 50/50, suggest the market is somewhat indecisive or waiting for a clearer signal. Exchange Variations: While the total is balanced, Binance shows a slightly stronger long bias compared to Bybit, which is almost perfectly balanced. These minor differences can sometimes reflect the dominant trading styles or demographics on different platforms. It’s important to remember that this ratio reflects *open positions*, not necessarily the volume or strength behind those positions. A few large ‘whale’ traders could potentially skew the ratio without representing the broader market sentiment accurately. Using the Ratio in Your Perpetual Futures Trading Strategy So, how can you use this long short ratio information in your own perpetual futures trading ? Think of it as one tool in your analytical toolbox, not the only one. Here are some actionable insights: Sentiment Confirmation: If you are considering a long trade based on other technical or fundamental analysis, a slightly long-biased ratio like this could offer minor confirmation of your view, suggesting you’re trading with the slight prevailing wind. Contrarian Indicator? Sometimes, extreme long or short ratios can be seen as a contrarian signal. If everyone is heavily long, who is left to buy to push the price higher? This current ratio isn’t extreme enough for a strong contrarian signal, but it’s a concept to keep in mind for future data points. Liquidation Risks: While not directly shown here, extreme ratios can build up ‘liquidity pools’ where a large number of stops or liquidations are clustered. A sudden move against the dominant side can trigger these, leading to cascading liquidations and rapid price swings. Monitoring ratios over time can give clues about where these clusters might be forming. Combine with Other Data: Never rely solely on the long-short ratio. Use it in conjunction with price action, volume analysis, funding rates (another key futures metric), and broader market news. Successful perpetual futures trading involves synthesizing multiple data points to form a complete picture. Beyond the Numbers: Limitations of the BTC Perpetual Futures Ratio While valuable, the long short ratio for BTC perpetual futures does have limitations: Lagging Indicator: The ratio reflects positions already taken. It doesn’t predict future entries or exits. Whale Influence: A few large positions can significantly impact the ratio, potentially masking the sentiment of smaller traders. Not Exchange-Inclusive: The ‘Total’ ratio is usually an aggregate of *some* major exchanges, but not necessarily *all* of them. Context is Key: A 51/49 ratio might mean different things depending on whether Bitcoin is trending strongly, ranging, or at a critical support/resistance level. Treat the ratio as a temperature check on market sentiment, not a definitive buy or sell signal. In Conclusion: What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Trading Sentiment Now? The latest 24-hour crypto futures data for BTC perpetual futures shows a market poised near equilibrium, with just a slight edge to the bulls based on the long short ratio . This suggests a period of relative indecision or consolidation among futures traders. While the sentiment isn’t overwhelmingly bullish or bearish, the slight lean towards long positions indicates that, on balance, more traders are betting on continued upward momentum or at least defending current price levels. For those engaged in perpetual futures trading , keeping an eye on how this ratio evolves, especially in response to price movements and news, can provide valuable context. Will the long bias strengthen, indicating growing confidence? Or will shorts start to increase, signaling potential downside pressure? Time, and continued data analysis, will tell.

Recent crypto IPOs and treasury announcements highlight growing institutional interest in Bitcoin (BTC) . This demand could soon extend to proven, low-volatility altcoins, according to Tracy Jin, COO of MEXC, who spoke with crypto.news. However, such a shift will largely depend on whether Bitcoin maintains strength above a critical threshold. “Capital markets are reopening to digital asset firms with credible models, while financial engineering — like Strategy’s hybrid fixed-income Bitcoin offering — signals a maturing appetite for low-volatility crypto returns. If momentum sustains and BTC holds above key thresholds, a broader institutional rotation into altcoins could follow,” Tracy Jin, MEXC. You might also like: Europe’s first Bitcoin Treasury firm plans to raise $340m to buy more BTC Traditional markets are actively driving crypto: Tracy Jin Jin pointed to several key developments as evidence of rising institutional interest in crypto. One standout example was Circle’s successful IPO . Gemini has also taken similar steps, while companies like Metaplanet are expanding their Bitcoin treasuries, including a planned $1 billion BTC acquisition. “All of these moves together point to a big change: crypto companies are no longer just reacting to market trends; they’re actually influencing how institutions can access crypto. As IPO calendars fill up and more money is being put into crypto through the stock market, it’s becoming a bigger part of traditional finance,” Tracy Jin, MEXC.

The key risk factor remains Bitcoin’s price. If BTC drops below the psychological $100,000 level, a temporary institutional pullback becomes more likely. As long as Bitcoin stays above $100,000 and big investors keep wanting it, more companies will probably go public with it, buy more of it, and get more money flowing into it — and not just into BTC but eventually into the whole altcoin market as well, as more people feel confident about cryptocurrency.

RISE , a real-time blockchain scaling Ethereum with record throughput and ultra-low latency, announced a $4 million investment from Galaxy Ventures, bringing total funds raised to date to $8 million. This latest funding round will enable RISE to continue to push the boundaries of blockchain performance and develop the next generation of blockchain applications. Offering instant transaction speeds is a key pillar of bringing more assets, enterprises, and users onchain, but building a blockchain that provides this has been difficult to date. RISE, a new blockchain built on top of Ethereum, solves this with its breakthrough transaction architecture, powered by Shreds which enable record-breaking latency as low as 5-milliseconds. This is especially significant for advanced DeFi use cases such as orderbook strategies, options, high-frequency trading, and market making. RISE launched its public testnet earlier this month, which has already undergone significant battle testing, reaching over 2 billion transactions, including over 50,000 transactions processed in a single 1-second block. This enables developers to experiment and build onchain apps that operate with a new standard of performance, introduced as “Infinite Speed”: real-time performance, decentralized. By rethinking blockchain design from first principles, RISE addresses a fundamental tradeoff where low latency and high throughput previously required compromising decentralization. Competing blockchains often rely on centralized approaches, introducing censorship risk and single points of failure. RISE was built from day one to deliver unstoppable performance without sacrificing decentralization, enabling real-time transactions on widely accessible, standard hardware. RISE will also implement performance-compatible based sequencing to leverage Ethereum’s vast network of validators and unlock synchronous composability between Ethereum and RISE. Key Differentiators of RISE: Shreds: Sub-blocktime transaction confirmations enabling as low as 5ms round-trip latency Scalable Throughput: Currently benchmarked at over 50,000 TPS, with plans to exceed 100,000 TPS Based Sequencing (Coming Soon): Unlocking a true extension of Ethereum and solving liquidity fragmentation for users Secured Shreds (Coming Soon): Preconfirmations economically secured by Ethereum Validators, significantly improving the security profile “Performance is only meaningful if it lasts,” said Sam Battenally, co-founder and CEO of RISE. “RISE was built to stay fast—forever. This investment from Galaxy Ventures underscores the need for infrastructure that doesn’t just scale technically, but scales trustlessly. We’re excited to accelerate toward mainnet and bring the next generation of crypto apps into reality.” RISE will use the funding to support product and app development in the lead-up to mainnet launch. Builders can explore the testnet now at portal.risechain.com . “RISE is the first project we’ve seen that addresses the scalability trilemma without material security tradeoffs,” said Neil Bhuta, Investor at Galaxy Ventures. “It brings a level of speed, scalability, and decentralization that is essential to supporting a new generation of high-performance applications. We’re proud to back a talented team that is pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology.” About RISE RISE is a next-generation Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain redefining performance with “Infinite Speed”—delivering instant transaction confirmation at unprecedented scale, while upholding Ethereum’s core principle of decentralization. Its architecture enables as low as 5ms latency and will support over 100,000 TPS, unlocking a radically improved experience for both developers and users.

RISE , a real-time blockchain scaling Ethereum with record throughput and ultra-low latency, announced a $4 million investment from Galaxy Ventures, bringing total funds raised to date to $8 million. This latest funding round will enable RISE to continue to push the boundaries of blockchain performance and develop the next generation of blockchain applications. Offering instant transaction speeds is a key pillar of bringing more assets, enterprises, and users onchain, but building a blockchain that provides this has been difficult to date. RISE, a new blockchain built on top of Ethereum, solves this with its breakthrough transaction architecture, powered by Shreds which enable record-breaking latency as low as 5-milliseconds. This is especially significant for advanced DeFi use cases such as orderbook strategies, options, high-frequency trading, and market making. RISE launched its public testnet earlier this month, which has already undergone significant battle testing, reaching over 2 billion transactions, including over 50,000 transactions processed in a single 1-second block. This enables developers to experiment and build onchain apps that operate with a new standard of performance, introduced as “Infinite Speed”: real-time performance, decentralized. By rethinking blockchain design from first principles, RISE addresses a fundamental tradeoff where low latency and high throughput previously required compromising decentralization. Competing blockchains often rely on centralized approaches, introducing censorship risk and single points of failure. RISE was built from day one to deliver unstoppable performance without sacrificing decentralization, enabling real-time transactions on widely accessible, standard hardware. RISE will also implement performance-compatible based sequencing to leverage Ethereum’s vast network of validators and unlock synchronous composability between Ethereum and RISE. Key Differentiators of RISE: Shreds: Sub-blocktime transaction confirmations enabling as low as 5ms round-trip latency Scalable Throughput: Currently benchmarked at over 50,000 TPS, with plans to exceed 100,000 TPS Based Sequencing (Coming Soon): Unlocking a true extension of Ethereum and solving liquidity fragmentation for users Secured Shreds (Coming Soon): Preconfirmations economically secured by Ethereum Validators, significantly improving the security profile “Performance is only meaningful if it lasts,” said Sam Battenally, co-founder and CEO of RISE. “RISE was built to stay fast—forever. This investment from Galaxy Ventures underscores the need for infrastructure that doesn’t just scale technically, but scales trustlessly. We’re excited to accelerate toward mainnet and bring the next generation of crypto apps into reality.” RISE will use the funding to support product and app development in the lead-up to mainnet launch. Builders can explore the testnet now at portal.risechain.com . “RISE is the first project we’ve seen that addresses the scalability trilemma without material security tradeoffs,” said Neil Bhuta, Investor at Galaxy Ventures. “It brings a level of speed, scalability, and decentralization that is essential to supporting a new generation of high-performance applications. We’re proud to back a talented team that is pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology.” About RISE RISE is a next-generation Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain redefining performance with “Infinite Speed”—delivering instant transaction confirmation at unprecedented scale, while upholding Ethereum’s core principle of decentralization. Its architecture enables as low as 5ms latency and will support over 100,000 TPS, unlocking a radically improved experience for both developers and users.

45721879,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=743311,1749476134,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45721879.jpeg,Xbox finally unveils handheld console after 10 years of speculation,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/xbox-unveils-handheld-console-after-10-years/,"Microsoft officially announced its first handheld console on Monday, the ROG Xbox Ally, ending more than a decade of speculation. The company revealed the device during a global press release, alongside news of its collaboration with Asus, setting a release window for late 2025. The Xbox Ally is Microsoft’s answer to its community’s questions, and years of internal development, scrapped trials, and industry rumors. Xbox Ally X preview: Source: Microsoft The idea of a handheld console device has circulated since the early 2010s, when insiders reported that Microsoft had ideas of several prototypes that never made it to production. The launch of the Xbox Ally comes just three days after Nintendo released the Switch 2, a hybrid system known for both handheld and docked play. “Whether you’re at home or on the go, your favorite games should follow you,” said Roanne Sones, Xbox’s head of gaming devices. “Both handhelds allow players to play natively, via the cloud, or remotely with their Xbox console in another room.” Two versions with specs for AAA games Microsoft is launching two versions of the Xbox Ally: the standard model and a premium variant dubbed the Xbox Ally X. According to the company’s press release, both devices will feature a 7.0-inch 1080p IPS display with a 120Hz refresh rate, variable refresh rate (VRR) support, and AMD FreeSync technology to cut down screen tearing during performance drops. The base model will be powered by an AMD Ryzen Z2 APU, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. It also includes a 60Wh battery. The higher-end Ally X steps up to the AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor, 24GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and an upgraded 80Wh battery. An IGN reviewer with early access to the Xbox Ally X reported playing Gears of War: Reloaded for approximately 15 minutes at 1080p resolution with high graphical settings. The test included AMD FSR 3.1 set to quality mode and 16x anisotropic filtering. According to the reviewer, the device held well at 60 frames per second throughout the session while running in Turbo mode, which increases power output at the cost of heat and battery efficiency. They also noted that while Gears of War: Reloaded is a remaster of an Xbox 360-era title, it was a significant visual upgrade over the original game. However, they cautioned that performance results might differ when running more demanding titles such as Doom: The Dark Ages or CyberPunk 2077 at maximum graphics settings. Windows and Game Pass access According to developers, the Xbox Ally is built on a slimmed-down version of Windows for users to access their PC games more easily. The device features a customized Xbox app but still functions as a Windows-based machine, allowing gamers to launch third-party gaming platforms such as Steam, EA Play, and others outside the Xbox ecosystem. “Because these handhelds run Windows, you have access to games you can’t get elsewhere, so you can enjoy the full freedom and versatility of PC gaming,” Sones said. Much similar to the Xbox Series X|S, subscribers to Xbox Game Pass can play hundreds of titles off the bat, including upcoming games like Activision’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 , slated to be released later this year. At launch, the Ally and Ally X will be available in several countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and other countries across Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific. The list spans 30 countries in total, with Microsoft promising that additional regions will follow based on the current ROG Ally distribution zones. Cryptopolitan will keep you updated about the console’s pricing, accessory compatibility, and pre-order timelines in the coming months. Microsoft is also expected to reveal more specifications and software features ahead of the official release .

It can also jeopardize the region’s fintech leadership, driving startups and talent abroad. The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) sees 54 nations as a unified market incorporating digital assets. But new rules and regulations in different African countries threaten this vision of unity. Kenya risks more than revenue with new crypto tax With a revised 1.5% crypto transactions tax, the nation risks losing regional fintech leadership, startup businesses overseas, and fracturing Africa’s digital economy, along with undermining its crypto revenue. It also pushes young African crypto users and tech enthusiasts to pursue unregulated platforms and informal channels. Many Kenyans, whose primary income is from trading cryptocurrency, are at risk of losing income. Freelancers who converted crypto into money to pay rent or school fees might lose their income. It also threatens content creators, developers, stakers, validators, and NFT artists who use cryptocurrency assets as daily payment roots. The National Assembly Committee on Finance and National Planning suggests a fourth point path for adequate crypto tax regulation in Kenya. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Tax in India Is Crushing Profits, Here’s How Bitcoin ETFs Can Save You , Key highlights of the National Assembly Committee regarding tax Tax efficiency: Digital assets should be treated under existing property disposal rules to avoid double taxation rather than the customized tax of 1.5%. This also eases the daily utility of crypto assets. Balancing innovation and regulation: Kenya should open itself to blockchain experimentation– from carbon credits to stablecoins. Privacy compliance: Public audits and cryptographic proofs should be integrated to ensure customer privacy. With this approach, the privacy of the investors will not be compromised. Phased rollout: The national assembly committee suggests that Kenya should prioritize education and voluntary compensation. It will assist in building capacity before fully enforced. What’s next? Upcoming bills under consideration Besides crypto tax, Kenya is also considering the Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) Bill 2025. The bill aims to strengthen existing regulations, such as anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT), along with reducing illicit financial flows. However, Kenya’s current draft framework lacks privacy-preserving mechanisms, risking citizen privacy. The bill has been questioned by parliament about the data privacy clause in the Finance Bill 2025. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Quiet but calculated accumulation is underway across a select group of altcoins—hinting at where smart money sees the next big breakout. This article dives into four tokens flying under the radar yet lighting up whale wallets, offering a glimpse at which projects might lead the charge in the next altcoin rally. Uniswap (UNI) Bulls Gain Ground Amid Market Struggles Source: tradingview Uniswap (UNI) shows signs of bullish momentum with its price sitting between $5.71 and $7.02. The recent climb of over 4% in the past week suggests bulls might be gaining strength. The coin is currently hovering around its 10-day moving average of $6.34, indicating short-term improvement. However, with the RSI at nearly 72, overbought signals are evident. If bullish trends continue, UNI could aim for a resistance level close to $7.72, potentially offering a gain of around 10%. If it breaks past that, the next target is $9.03, marking a potential rise of over 30%. Despite recent challenges, the outlook hints at promising growth opportunities for UNI. Solana Struggles: Bears Dominate as SOL Faces Price Pressure Source: tradingview Solana is experiencing a challenging phase, with its price hovering between roughly $140 and $164. The bears seem to be in control, driving the price down in recent months. Indicators suggest limited upward momentum right now, as it's far below the key resistance level of $175. Moreover, the coin's relative strength index points to overbought conditions, signaling potential selling pressure. If bulls regain strength, SOL could target the second resistance level near $198, marking significant potential growth. Yet, this would require a boost of almost 21% from the upper range. For now, though, the coin must hold above $130 to avoid further declines. Raydium Struggles as Bears Slow Price Recovery Source: tradingview Raydium (RAY) is facing a tough stretch, with its current price between $1.97 and $2.55. Bulls appear weak. After all, the coin has dropped over 15% in the past month and more than 51% over the last six months. Resistance looms at $2.84, a level that seems distant with RAY's slight rebound efforts. If bullish momentum kicks in, breaking $2.84 could push the price towards the $3.42 mark, representing about a 40% increase from its lower range. Yet, with a relative strength index above 70, it's overbought, hinting at challenges ahead. Raydium's struggle against bearish trends continues, signaling a complex road to recovery. Ondo Token Struggles to Break Resistance, Bears Still Comfortable Source: tradingview Ondo token is moving between $0.77 and $0.88, close to the 10-day and 100-day averages. The current position shows some strength in short-term recovery, but it remains under key resistance at $0.94. Bears seem to hold more ground since the coin has dropped nearly 16% over the past month and over 50% in six months. Though there's a chance to hit the stronger resistance at $1.05, Ondo needs to gain around 20% in price. The RSI is nearing the overbought zone but isn't quite there, suggesting limited bullish momentum. Without a definitive push above $0.94, further growth seems uncertain. Conclusion Whales aren’t gambling—they’re positioning. From Uniswap's bullish signals to the potential rebound of underdogs like Raydium and Ondo, the accumulation patterns reveal growing conviction behind these assets. While each token faces its own challenges, the early interest from large holders suggests hidden confidence. For investors paying attention, these four altcoins could be the seeds of future gains—if you’re not holding them yet, now’s the time to decide whether to follow the whales.

Big news from Argentina involving a high-profile figure and the often-wild world of memecoins. Argentina’s Anti-Corruption Office has officially cleared President Javier Milei of violating public ethics laws concerning his promotion of the LIBRA memecoin. This ruling comes after a period of scrutiny following the memecoin’s dramatic price collapse and subsequent legal actions. It’s a significant development that touches upon the intersection of politics, digital assets, and public conduct in the rapidly evolving space of Argentina crypto . What Does This Ruling Mean for Argentina Crypto? The decision by Argentina’s Anti-Corruption Office provides clarity, at least from an ethical standpoint, regarding President Milei’s actions. The core of the ruling hinges on the finding that President Javier Milei ‘s post on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) on February 14th was made in a personal capacity. Crucially, the office stated that no government resources were used or compromised in connection with this post. This distinction between personal endorsement and official governmental action is paramount in public ethics law. For the broader landscape of Argentina crypto , this case highlights the increasing visibility and potential influence of digital assets, even speculative ones like memecoins, within the national conversation. While this specific ruling focuses on the President’s personal conduct rather than setting a precedent for crypto legality or regulation itself, it underscores the need for clear lines when public figures engage with the crypto market. The case emerged publicly after an Argentine federal judge ordered the freezing of assets linked to the LIBRA project following its sharp decline in value. The LIBRA Memecoin Saga: Rise, Fall, and Fallout The LIBRA memecoin captured attention partly due to its association with figures linked to President Milei’s political circle, and subsequently, the President’s own social media activity. Memecoins are known for their volatile nature, often driven by social media trends, community hype, and celebrity endorsements rather than underlying technology or utility. The trajectory of LIBRA was a classic example of this volatility: Initial hype and promotion, gaining traction among certain communities. A rapid price surge, attracting investors hoping for quick gains. A sudden and dramatic collapse, reportedly losing over 85% of its value. Investor losses and subsequent legal scrutiny, leading to the asset freeze ordered by an Argentine judge. The collapse of the LIBRA memecoin naturally led to questions, particularly regarding the involvement of individuals connected to the government and the President’s social media mention. These questions prompted the ethics investigation. Navigating Ethics in Crypto Promotion: Lessons from the Case The central question in this case revolved around Ethics in crypto , specifically when a head of state promotes or even mentions a specific digital asset. The Anti-Corruption Office’s ruling provides a specific answer based on Argentine law and the facts presented: personal capacity, no government resources. However, the situation raises broader points about ethical considerations: Separating Personal and Official Roles: Public figures, especially presidents, constantly navigate the line between their personal opinions and their official capacity. A social media post, even on a personal account, can be interpreted differently when made by the head of state. Potential for Undue Influence: Any mention or perceived endorsement from a high-profile individual can significantly impact the price and perception of a digital asset, potentially leading less informed investors into risky situations. Transparency: Clarity on whether an endorsement is personal, paid, or reflects official policy is crucial for maintaining public trust. While President Javier Milei was cleared in this instance based on the specific legal interpretation by the Anti-Corruption Office, the case serves as a potent reminder of the ethical tightrope public figures walk when engaging with the volatile and often opaque world of digital assets like memecoins. It highlights the need for extreme caution and transparency. Are More Crypto Regulations Needed? This incident also sparks discussion about the current state of Crypto regulations , not just in Argentina but globally. Memecoins, in particular, often fall into regulatory grey areas due to their speculative nature and lack of clear use cases. While Argentina has taken steps regarding crypto, such as clarifying tax rules and discussing potential integration of blockchain technology, specific regulations around the promotion of highly speculative assets by public figures or influencers remain a developing area. The LIBRA case doesn’t automatically necessitate new regulations, but it certainly adds fuel to the debate about investor protection and market integrity in the face of easily promoted, high-risk digital assets. Future discussions around Crypto regulations may well reference cases like this as evidence of potential risks. Challenges and Actionable Insights The challenges highlighted by the LIBRA memecoin situation are clear: the inherent risks of volatile assets, the potential for manipulation or pump-and-dump schemes, and the ethical dilemmas faced by public figures. For readers, the actionable insights are: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on social media hype or celebrity endorsements, regardless of who they are. Understand the project, its risks, and its underlying value (or lack thereof). Understand the Nature of Memecoins: Recognize that memecoins are highly speculative and can lose value rapidly. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Distinguish Personal from Official: Be critical of endorsements, especially from public officials, and consider whether they represent personal interest or official policy. Conclusion Argentina’s Anti-Corruption Office has ruled that President Javier Milei did not violate ethics laws with his LIBRA memecoin post, determining it was a personal action unrelated to government resources. This brings a specific ethical inquiry to a close for the President. However, the broader saga involving the LIBRA memecoin ‘s collapse and the subsequent asset freeze continues to underscore the volatile nature of memecoins and the complexities that arise when public figures engage with the crypto market. The case serves as a valuable lesson on the importance of ethical considerations, the need for clear distinctions between personal and official conduct, and the ever-present risks within the less regulated corners of the digital asset world, impacting the ongoing narrative around Argentina crypto .

Strong resistance emerged around that level, with high trading volume creating a rejection zone that prevented further advances, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. The Cosmos ecosystem, a network comprised of many independent blockchains, continues expanding its cross-chain capabilities through the Eureka upgrade, which kicked in April, enabling seamless communication with the Ethereum blockchain. Institutional developments including Bitbank's ATOM listing with promotional fee structures and Canary Capital's exploration of a Cosmos-backed ETF also provided support. Technical Analysis Support established around $4.21, with price stabilizing near $4.233 during consolidation phase. Significant hourly recovery occurred between 07:33-08:02, with price surging to $4.239 on heavy volume exceeding 16,000 units. New support level formed at $4.237 following the 1.4% bounce from the hour's low. The CD20 demonstrated notable volatility over the 24-hour period, reaching a peak of 1751.049 before falling back, with an overall range of 22.573 points (1.3%). After establishing a 24-hour high during the 22:00 hour on June 8th, CD20 entered a consolidation phase, retracing approximately 50% of its gains while maintaining support above the 1730 level, suggesting potential stabilization following the recent upward momentum.

Is this a signal the market is bracing for something explosive? Table of Contents Bitcoin price reclaims $107,000 as political jitters fade BTC options data shows strong bullish lean into June expiry BTC breakout gains traction with support from options flows Bitcoin price reclaims $107,000 as political jitters fade Bitcoin ( BTC ) has quietly stabilized after a volatile week in which political headlines briefly disrupted market sentiment. The public dispute between U.S. President Donald Trump and Elon Musk pushed BTC toward the $100,000 mark, raising concerns about short-term confidence. The decline, however, proved temporary. Over the weekend, Bitcoin began to recover, and as of Jun. 9, it is trading around $107,800, up nearly 2% in the past 24 hours. BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news Institutional activity appears to be reinforcing the rebound. A growing list of companies is renewing interest in Bitcoin as a long-term treasury asset, drawing renewed attention to its role beyond trading. MicroStrategy has re-entered the spotlight with a new capital raise. The company is issuing $1 billion in perpetual preferred stock and plans to allocate part of the proceeds toward additional Bitcoin purchases. Metaplanet, which has been gradually building its BTC reserves over the past year, introduced a more ambitious target on Jun. 6. The firm now aims to accumulate 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027, expanding its original goal of 21,000 BTC by a factor of ten. These developments come amid ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. U.S. inflation data is due this week, beginning with the Consumer Price Index on Wednesday, followed by the Producer Price Index on Thursday. Traders are watching both releases for signals that could influence the Federal Reserve’s next policy move. The CME FedWatch Tool currently shows an over 99% probability that the Fed will maintain interest rates between 4.25% and 4.50% at its Jun. 17 meeting. Against this backdrop, let’s unpack what current BTC options data reveals about momentum and whether traders are preparing for more upside or bracing for a pullback. BTC options data shows strong bullish lean into June expiry The Jun. 27 Bitcoin options expiry on Deribit reflects one of the most tightly concentrated setups in recent months. Bitcoin options (June expiry) | Source: Deribit Total open interest stands at 123,528 contracts, composed of 77,077 calls and 46,451 puts, resulting in a put/call ratio of 0.60. The ratio suggests a continued bullish lean in positioning. The Max Pain level, where the most aggregate losses would be realized across both calls and puts, is located at $100,000. Above that level, bullish positioning becomes more visible. A significant spike in open interest appears at the $120,000 strike, indicating that many traders are eyeing it as a short-term upside target. One of the most notable data points is the surge in call open interest at $300,000. While strikes at $200,000 and $220,000 show some activity, the aggressive positioning at $300,000 stands out. This type of exposure is likely tied to tail-risk hedging or asymmetric upside protection, potentially by institutions or large spot holders. On the downside, the $85,000 strike holds the most concentrated open interest. While some protection is built between $60,000 and $90,000, the volume drops sharply below $85,000. If Bitcoin trades within the $95,000 to $105,000 range as expiry nears, many options buyers on both sides may face decay-related losses. The Jul. 25 expiry offers a more evenly distributed structure. Total open interest is lower at 40,267 contracts, with 25,109 calls and 15,158 puts. The put/call ratio remains at 0.60, indicating a similar bullish inclination, though with a more measured approach. Bitcoin options (July expiry) | Source: Deribit Call open interest is spread across key levels at $120,000, $130,000, $140,000, and $150,000, with relatively even distribution. Unlike the June expiry, there are no outsized bets far beyond current spot prices. The Max Pain for July is positioned at $104,000, slightly higher than June’s $100,000, suggesting a gradual upward shift in pricing expectations. Much of the July call exposure becomes meaningful only above $110,000. Unless BTC breaks through and holds above that level, a large portion of bullish open interest may remain inactive. On the put side, July mirrors much of the structure seen in June. The $85,000 strike continues to act as the key downside hedge, now joined by increased activity at $100,000. Below $70,000, put interest remains minimal, indicating that sharp downside moves are not being actively priced in. Overall, both the June and July expiries suggest a market tilted toward the upside, though with different expressions. June shows more aggressive exposure at the high end, particularly at $120,000 and $300,000, while July reflects a more technical and layered positioning framework. Bearish hedging remains limited in both cases, with $85,000 acting as the key zone of downside defense. The absence of deeper hedging under $70,000 suggests a low probability market view of capitulation. BTC breakout gains traction with support from options flows Bitcoin has reclaimed the $107,000 level, prompting analysts to assess whether the recent move marks the beginning of a broader breakout. The return above this zone is being read as a short-term structural shift following several days of tight, bearish price action. Analyst ali_charts pointed to the breakout above $106,600 and identified immediate upside targets at $108,300 and $110,000. Resistance broke, and #Bitcoin $BTC could reach $108,300 or even $110,000! https://t.co/NJQGfyD5mX pic.twitter.com/oVF0rccXlE — Ali (@ali_charts) June 9, 2025 According to his chart, BTC is currently positioned between the breakout level and the next key resistance area. Sustained movement through this band may allow the price to extend higher without requiring fresh catalysts. Michaël van de Poppe also emphasized the importance of the $106,500 support. In his latest analysis, holding above this area could attract increased interest from short-term traders and pressure short sellers to exit. I mentioned before that I'm looking at $106,500 for #Bitcoin to break. It's happening and it's showing strength. I've added some more context of when I'm expecting to see the acceleration. As long as we start staying above crucial levels, we'll start to see: – More buying… pic.twitter.com/scRtgpbjqJ — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) June 9, 2025 A move toward $108,900, he noted, may trigger faster price acceleration due to reactive trading behavior. These outlooks are supported by recent options data. Open interest in the Jun. 27 expiry remains heavily concentrated at the $120,000 call strike, reflecting a clear bullish bias. If Bitcoin begins closing above $110,000, those positions start gaining delta exposure. Traders, in response, may hedge through spot or perpetual contracts, mechanically contributing to upward price momentum. On the downside, bearish positioning appears limited. The $85,000 strike holds the most meaningful put volume, acting as a key hedge.. Whether BTC can hold above these levels through macro data releases this week will determine whether this setup evolves into a trend or resets into consolidation. As always, do your own research, trade wisely, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

This move, confirmed on 9 June, has caught the attention of traders and regulators alike, as it continues a trend of high-volume minting by the world’s largest stablecoin issuer. Whale Alert @whale_alert · Follow 💵 💵 💵 💵 💵 💵 💵 💵 💵 💵 1,000,000,000 #USDT (1,000,799,999 USD) minted at Tether Treasury whale-alert.io/transaction/tr… 2:52 PM · Jun 9, 2025 2.8K Reply Copy link Read 141 replies The latest mint represents more than 1% of all USDT currently issued on Tron, where most of Tether’s supply is concentrated. As questions grow about stablecoin transparency and oversight, this issuance adds to the scrutiny facing Tether’s operations and market influence. Tron dominates as USDT supply crosses $76 billion The new $1 billion mint has brought Tether’s total USDT supply on Tron to $76 billion. That surpasses the $63.2 billion in USDT supply on Ethereum, cementing Tron’s status as the leading blockchain for USDT transactions. Overall, Tether’s circulating supply now exceeds 156 billion across chains. The scale of minting on Tron reflects both user preferences and cost considerations. Tron offers cheaper and faster transactions compared to Ethereum, making it a preferred network for stablecoin transfers, particularly for high-frequency traders and centralised exchanges. However, the concentration of such large volumes on a single chain also exposes systemic risks in the event of a disruption. Market timing sparks renewed speculation Tether’s minting pattern has frequently aligned with bullish moves in the broader crypto market. When 2 billion USDT were issued on Tron on 21 May, Bitcoin surged to a record high of $111,000 the following day. As of now, the freshly minted $1 billion has not yet entered circulation, remaining in Tether’s treasury. But the anticipation of deployment has already fuelled discussions about whether this signals another wave of buying activity or market volatility. USDT is often used to move funds into cryptocurrencies quickly, giving traders flexibility during times of high momentum. Still, without clear disclosures from Tether about how and when it injects liquidity, market participants are left to speculate on the implications. Calls for IPO dismissed despite valuation estimates Tether remains privately held, but recent estimates suggest it would rank among the most valuable firms in crypto if it chose to list. Analyst Jon Ma pegged Tether’s hypothetical IPO valuation at $515 billion, a figure that would make it one of the largest public offerings globally. Despite this, CEO Paolo Ardoino has publicly dismissed any plans for an IPO. The company maintains that it does not require external capital or a public listing to sustain its operations. However, remaining private means Tether avoids the level of financial scrutiny required of public companies—an issue that continues to draw criticism from regulators. Tether has long been at the centre of debates around stablecoin reserves and auditing. Although it now releases quarterly assurance reports, critics argue these fall short of the transparency required to fully assess systemic risk. With the US exploring new stablecoin legislation, the pressure on Tether to increase its disclosures may intensify. Regulatory spotlight returns as stablecoin rules loom The latest mint also arrives amid renewed focus from US lawmakers on stablecoin oversight. Draft regulations currently under discussion could impose reserve requirements, transparency standards, and potential restrictions on issuers who do not comply. Given Tether’s dominant position in the market and its limited disclosure compared to rivals like Circle’s USDC, it could face challenges under a stricter regulatory regime. While it continues to maintain that its reserves are fully backed, the absence of third-party audits remains a sticking point. Whether the $1 billion mint is a sign of bullish activity ahead or a strategic liquidity manoeuvre, it once again places Tether in the centre of the stablecoin debate—where questions of trust, scale, and regulation intersect.

This significant decline to approximately 2.3 million BTC reflects a shift in investor behavior and market structure, with implications for Bitcoin's liquidity and price dynamics Why is a Hodling Trend Skyrocketing in the Bitcoin Ecosystem? Coins leaving exchanges in droves is deemed bullish because they are held for future purposes other than speculation. As a result, selling pressure decreases because cryptocurrencies are usually kept in exchanges for liquidation purposes. Since this trend is playing out in the BTC network with exchange balances being at a 7-year low, more holders are moving their coins to digital wallets and cold storage, showing long-term confidence. CryptoQuant data also shares similar insights that Bitcoin’s hodl level has hit a 2-year high, according to the Bitcoin exchange flows to network activity ratio. This measure, also known as the Fund Flow Ratio, is a key on-chain metric that measures the proportion of Bitcoin moving through exchanges relative to the total transaction volume on the network. It's calculated by dividing the total exchange inflows and outflows by the total amount of Bitcoin transferred across the entire network. One primary factor contributing to exchange balance dropping is the migration of Bitcoin holdings from exchanges to institutional custodians, particularly following the approval of Bitcoin Spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January 2024. Major asset managers, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have accumulated substantial Bitcoin reserves for their ETF products, often utilizing custodians like Coinbase. This movement has led to a reclassification of holdings, where assets previously counted as exchange balances are now under institutional custody. Banking giant JP Morgan recently revealed that it could accept Bitcoin ETF shares for loans , in the process, unlocking new credit lines. Delving Deeper into Bitcoin’s Supply Shock Scenario A supply shock occurs when the availability of an asset diminishes while demand remains steady or increases, often leading to a price surge. In Bitcoin's case, several converging factors have the potential of creating a notable supply shock: 1. Post-Halving Scarcity and ETFs Bitcoin's protocol includes a halving event approximately every four years, reducing the reward miners receive for adding new blocks to the blockchain. The most recent halving in April 2024 decreased the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, effectively halving the rate at which new bitcoins enter circulation. This reduction tightens supply, especially as demand continues to grow. The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs has provided institutional investors with a regulated avenue to gain exposure to Bitcoin. 2. Corporate Treasury Adoption An increasing number of companies are incorporating Bitcoin into their corporate treasuries as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. As of June 2025, 80 firms collectively own around 3.4% of the total Bitcoin supply. Notable examples include MicroStrategy, which holds approximately 580,000 BTC, and GameStop, which recently invested $500 million into Bitcoin. South Korean entertainment conglomerate K Wave Media recently revealed plans to roll out a $500 million Bitcoin treasury strategy with the aim of expanding its K-pop related business, including music distribution and concert management. 3. Macroeconomic Tailwinds Global macroeconomic factors are also contributing to Bitcoin's bullish outlook. The U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policies have led to an expected 18% increase in the global M2 money supply in 2025, from $107 trillion to over $127 trillion. This monetary expansion, coupled with a weakening U.S. dollar, enhances Bitcoin's appeal as a store of value. Conclusion The decline in exchange-held Bitcoin reduces the immediate supply available for trading, potentially leading to decreased selling pressure. In economic terms, a lower supply amid steady or increasing demand can exert upward pressure on prices. With BTC reserves on exchanges hitting a 7-year low, it remains to be seen whether a supply shock will jumpstart the apex cryptocurrency to the next level as Bitcoin traverses the $105,216 level.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-09 13:50:07

Binance , one of the world’s leading crypto exchanges, has just announced a significant new listing that’s set to capture market attention. Get ready for the arrival of the HOME/USDT perpetual contract , offering traders a fresh opportunity with substantial leverage. What Does the HOME/USDT Perpetual Contract Listing Mean for Traders? Binance officially confirmed on its website that it will list the HOME/USDT perpetual contract . This is a key development for anyone engaged in crypto trading , providing another instrument to add to their portfolio. The listing is scheduled for June 10th at 11:30 UTC. What makes this particularly noteworthy is the availability of up to 50x leverage on this contract. For those unfamiliar, a perpetual contract is a type of futures contract that doesn’t have an expiry date. This allows traders to hold positions indefinitely, as long as they maintain sufficient margin. Trading perpetual contracts, especially with high leverage, offers the potential for significant gains but also carries substantial risk. Here are the core details of the announcement: Asset Pair: HOME/USDT Contract Type: Perpetual Listing Date & Time: June 10, 2024, at 11:30 UTC Maximum Leverage: Up to 50x Platform: Binance Futures Additionally, the HOME token will be integrated into Binance Alpha slightly earlier, at 11:00 UTC on the same day. Binance Alpha typically provides users with access to real-time market data, insights, and potentially early access features related to listed assets. Diving into Perpetual Contracts: Why Are They Popular in Crypto Trading? Perpetual contracts have become incredibly popular in the crypto space, largely due to their flexibility. Unlike traditional futures that expire, perpetual contracts mirror spot market prices while allowing traders to use leverage . This means you can control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. The mechanism that keeps the perpetual contract price close to the spot price is called the ‘funding rate’. Depending on market sentiment, traders holding long or short positions pay or receive this fee periodically. This unique feature makes them distinct from traditional futures. For traders on platforms like Binance , perpetual contracts offer: Continuous trading without expiry dates. The ability to profit from both rising (going long) and falling (going short) markets. Access to higher leverage compared to spot trading. Understanding 50x Leverage: High Rewards, Higher Risks The announcement of 50x leverage on the HOME/USDT perpetual contract is a key detail. Leverage amplifies both potential profits and losses. With 50x leverage, a 1% price movement in the underlying asset (HOME) can result in a 50% change in the value of your leveraged position. This presents a massive opportunity for quick gains if the market moves in your favor. However, it’s crucial to understand the amplified risk. A small adverse price movement can lead to a liquidation of your position, meaning you lose your entire initial margin. Trading with high leverage requires a strong understanding of risk management, including setting stop-loss orders and managing position sizes carefully. Example: If you invest $100 with 50x leverage, you control a $5,000 position. If HOME price increases by 2%, your position gains $100 (2% of $5,000), effectively doubling your initial investment (before fees). However, if HOME price drops by just 2%, your position loses $100, potentially liquidating your $100 margin. What is Binance Alpha and Why Does HOME Matter Here? Binance Alpha is a platform feature often used by experienced traders and analysts to access in-depth market data, trading insights, and sometimes early information or tools related to specific assets. Adding HOME to Binance Alpha at 11:00 UTC, slightly before the perpetual contract listing, suggests that Binance is providing resources for traders to analyze HOME and prepare for trading the HOME/USDT perpetual contract . Accessing Binance Alpha might offer valuable data points or analytical tools that could help traders make more informed decisions when the contract goes live. This early inclusion highlights the importance Binance places on equipping its users with information, especially for new listings. Strategies for Trading New Listings Like HOME on Binance Trading a newly listed Perpetual Contract like HOME/USDT can be exciting but also volatile. Here are some strategies traders might consider: Research: Although the source doesn’t detail the HOME project, try to find information about the token, its use case, and team before trading. Start Small: Especially with 50x leverage, begin with a small position size to test the waters and understand the market’s initial reaction. Use Stop-Loss Orders: Always set stop-loss orders to limit potential losses in case the market moves unexpectedly against your position. Monitor Funding Rates: Pay attention to the funding rate of the perpetual contract, as it can impact your trading costs, especially for positions held for longer periods. Watch Market Sentiment: New listings can be driven by hype. Observe the initial trading volume and price action closely. Remember, market conditions for new listings can be highly unpredictable. The initial hours and days after listing often see significant price swings. Navigating the Risks of High-Leverage Crypto Trading While the potential rewards of 50x leverage are attractive, the risks cannot be overstated. High leverage increases the speed at which you can lose capital. It’s not suitable for all traders, especially beginners. Key risks to be aware of when trading the HOME/USDT perpetual contract with high leverage include: Liquidation: A small price movement can wipe out your margin. Volatility: New listings can experience extreme price swings, making positions vulnerable. Funding Rate Swings: High funding rates can eat into profits or increase costs significantly. Execution Risk: Fast-moving markets can sometimes lead to slippage on order execution. Responsible crypto trading involves understanding these risks and implementing strict risk management practices. Only trade with capital you can afford to lose. Why This Binance Listing is Generating Buzz Any new listing on a major exchange like Binance generates interest. The addition of the HOME/USDT perpetual contract expands the available trading instruments for millions of users. The inclusion of 50x leverage specifically targets experienced traders looking for high-risk, high-reward opportunities. This listing could potentially bring increased trading volume and attention to the HOME token, regardless of its underlying fundamentals initially. Traders will be watching closely to see the initial price discovery and volatility following the 11:30 UTC launch. Actionable Steps for Traders Interested in HOME/USDT If you are interested in trading the HOME/USDT perpetual contract on Binance , here are some actionable steps you can take: Ensure you have a verified Binance account capable of futures trading.

At 11:30 UTC, the contract will be available. Approach trading cautiously, especially in the initial phase. Start with a demo account if possible, or use very small position sizes if trading live for the first time. Remember that trading leveraged products is not suitable for everyone. Assess your risk tolerance and understanding before participating. Conclusion: Seizing the Moment on Binance The upcoming listing of the HOME/USDT perpetual contract on Binance on June 10th at 11:30 UTC marks another expansion of trading opportunities on the platform. With up to 50x leverage available, this listing is poised to attract traders seeking high-octane opportunities in crypto trading .

Analysts speculate that if the platform delivers on its utility promise and garners adoption, it could reach $1 or higher, marking a potential 200x return from current levels. This type of asymmetrical risk-reward profile is rare in the current market space. With over $1.2 million already raised, Ozak AI is demonstrating strong investor confidence and growing market interest. Solana (SOL) Solana remains one of the most promising Layer-1 blockchain networks due to its high-speed, low-cost architecture and growing DeFi and NFT ecosystems. Having recovered from bear market lows, SOL is trading within the $100–$150 range and may reach $300 in the next bull cycle. However, for investors entering now, the upside is roughly 2x–3x based on bullish price targets. While Solana offers lower risk and solid fundamentals, its larger market cap limits explosive short-term returns. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin, the original meme coin, continues to attract attention thanks to its strong community and Elon Musk’s support. Yet, despite past surges, DOGE’s use case remains limited, and price volatility is driven primarily by speculation. From current levels, some forecasts suggest DOGE may revisit the $1 mark in a best-case scenario, representing a 5x–6x gain. While notable, the lack of clear utility and development progress puts a ceiling on long-term confidence. Pepe Coin (PEPE) PEPE has taken the meme coin space by storm, offering insane returns to early holders. However, like other meme coins, it lacks technological value and depends heavily on social media hype. If PEPE reaches $0.00001, it could still produce 2x–4x gains, but the risks are considerable, and it lacks the kind of structural or utility foundation that supports sustainable growth. For investors seeking massive upside, Ozak AI stands out as the strongest candidate. While Solana offers security, and DOGE and PEPE provide speculative appeal, Ozak AI combines early-stage pricing, strong fundamentals, and real utility—a rare combination in today’s market. With listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, a rapidly growing presale, and increasing adoption of AI in blockchain, Ozak AI could be the breakout performer of 2025. For those willing to act before the token lists publicly, the opportunity for exponential returns is still on the table.

The surge is also linked to a jump in customer orders placed ahead of U.S. tariffs, which could take effect next month after a suspension period expires. The finance ministry reported that the country’s exports rose 38.6% from the same month a year ago – the fastest pace in almost 15 years – to $51.74%. According to the ministry, the figure was also a record high, and for the first time, the value of Taiwan’s exports exceeded $50 billion. Taiwan braces for U.S. tariffs as exports rise The surge, the 19th consecutive monthly increase, was higher than the 25% expected by economists in a Reuters poll and surpassed April’s 29.9%. Taiwan firms, including TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, are major suppliers to Nvidia , Apple, and other tech giants. The ministry acknowledged that May exports benefited from continued strong AI demand and customers bringing forward orders to hedge against the possibility of increased U.S. tariffs. U.S. President Donald Trump had previously imposed a 32% import levy on goods from Taiwan, but he later announced a 90-day pause in April to allow for trade negotiations. The ministry also believes that while AI and other new technologies should continue to boost its exports, the uncertainty surrounding the U.S. tariffs and geopolitical risks could threaten the global economic outlook. “The overall growth of exports was impressive, but I would caution that a lot of it is because of export frontloading as the U.S. may still apply tariffs on chips and exempted electronic products. We are bound to see a slowdown later in the year.” -Michelle Lam, Greater China Economist at Societe Generale SA. The ministry expects exports for June to increase between 15% and 25% year-on-year. Last month, the country’s exports to the U.S. surged 87.4% year-on-year to $15.52 billion, versus a surge in April. Taiwan’s total exports of electronic components inched up by 28.4% in May of the year to $17.2 billion, with semiconductor exports up 30.1%. According to the country’s finance ministry, imports rose 25% to $29.13 billion, lower than economists’ predictions of 30.2%. Head of Asia research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group, Khoon Goh, warned that the big export figures could put more pressure on the Taiwan dollar to strengthen if exporters were to convert their income. Taiwan’s president seems optimistic about trade deals with the U.S. In a speech that marked Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te’s first year as president, he struck an accommodating tone despite the tariff pressure. He said trade tensions between the U.S. and Taiwan were just “frictions between friends” in a show of optimism as negotiations near the deadline. The President maintained that the U.S. and Taiwan have long cooperated and encouraged each other to grow. He believes there are bound to be frictions between allies, which they can eventually reconcile. Ching-te also backed increased investments by Taiwanese firms in the U.S. He said he would continue to encourage foreign investment in the country, citing an announcement by U.S. tech company Nvidia about opening a new office in northern Taipei. The tech company’s Taiwan-born CEO Jensen Huang also acknowledged that the firm would build an artificial intelligence supercomputer on the island in partnership with TSMC , tech company Foxconn, and the Taiwanese government. In March, TSMC responded to Trump’s tariff threats by pledging a new $100 billion investment in the U.S., adding to earlier commitments to invest more than $65 billion in three factories in Arizona, one of which began production late last year. Despite the impact of U.S. tariffs, TSMC’s chairman and chief executive, CC Wei, said the artificial intelligence business would remain strong. He also argued that the company expects record earnings this year as it increases semiconductor production capacity to meet soaring demand for AI technology.

These updates were featured in SBI Group’s May 2025 report, which outlines the company’s ongoing collaboration with Ripple and reveals new strategic directions. Coin Bureau shared a screenshot of this report on X, revealing that the financial services giant holds approximately 9% of Ripple Labs, making it the largest external shareholder. The two companies co-founded SBI Ripple Asia, with SBI Group controlling a 60% stake. This joint venture has already brought blockchain-based remittance services to Japan, using XRP as a bridge currency since 2021. According to the report, SBI Remit remains focused on leveraging XRP for cross-border payments and will be providing Japan’s first international remittance service powered by the digital asset. BULLISH: XRP MADE QUIET POWER MOVES! Financial Conglomerate SBI Holdings to provide remittance services via Ripple Ledger called SBI Remit. RLUSD stablecoin is set to expand SBI VC Trade, and XRPL powered NFTs at Expo 2025 Osaka — all confirmed in SBI Group’s May report. pic.twitter.com/wQbCEQQuPT — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) June 8, 2025 NFTs on the XRPL and Expo 2025 Osaka In addition to remittance services, SBI is also advancing its use of Ripple’s infrastructure for non-financial applications. The report highlights that NFTs issued on the XRPL will be showcased at Expo 2025 in Osaka, Kansai, Japan. This confirms a new layer of adoption for the digital asset, broadening its use beyond traditional finance into digital collectibles and event engagement. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The XRPL’s NFT functionality was introduced through amendments and token standards and allows issuers to mint and trade NFTs with minimal transaction costs. Integrating these into a major world expo points to institutional confidence in the network’s scalability and performance. More Institutional Integration for RLUSD and XRP The report also discloses that discussions are underway regarding RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin. The firm launched RLUSD last year as part of its broader stablecoin strategy, and SBI revealed its plans to integrate the stablecoin into its digital ecosystem in early 2025. Another forward-looking note in the report confirms SBI’s intention to partner with Hidden Road, the prime brokerage firm that Ripple recently acquired for $1.25 billion . The details in SBI Group’s report indicate a sustained institutional commitment to XRP’s ecosystem. From XRP-powered remittances to NFTs and the integration of RLUSD, the partnership appears to be evolving across multiple fronts with XRP in the middle of everything. As Coin Bureau noted, Ripple and SBI are continuing to make “quiet power moves,” with the potential to reshape blockchain use cases in Japan and beyond.

While Pi Network continues to delay migration and SHIB sees signs of momentum through a burn rate spike, BlockDAG (BDAG) is pushing toward the mainstream with strong traction. With 1.5 million users actively mining BDAG through the X1 app and whispers of a possible NBA partnership, the project is expanding its presence far beyond tech circles. BlockDAG’s strategic direction resembles the early moves of some of the most recognized Web3 brands. It’s gaining cultural traction while still in presale, showing that its reach goes beyond typical crypto boundaries. Backed by over $291 million in presale funding, high demand for mining equipment, and an upcoming GO LIVE reveal that will announce 20 exchange listings, BDAG is shaping up as a serious contender. More than a digital asset, it’s becoming a movement, a utility, and a cultural symbol. Pi Network (PI): Migration Challenges Raise Concerns Pi Network started with a bold idea: mobile-first crypto mining without needing expensive hardware. But years later, only around 10 million PI tokens have transitioned to the open mainnet, a small fraction compared to its total supply. This has left most of its large user base locked in a restricted environment without the ability to trade or use their tokens. As time drags on, users are becoming more frustrated by unclear updates and delayed rollouts. Many who joined Pi as early as 2019 are now openly questioning its progress. While the concept drew millions through accessibility, the lack of tangible progress, uncertain exchange listing timeline, and fading transparency are hurting its credibility. With no solid update on full migration and few ecosystem advancements, Pi risks losing the trust that helped it grow early on. What started as hope is now turning into hesitation. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Burn Activity Fuels Short-Term Confidence Shiba Inu is again gaining traction after recording a sudden 300% jump in burn rate within a day. This increase also triggered a wave of short liquidation events, signaling a potential shift toward a bullish move, according to some market watchers. SHIB still commands a dedicated following in the meme coin space. The ecosystem has made progress through Shibarium and ShibaSwap, pushing for more functionality than just memes. These projects reflect a shift toward a more practical direction. Still, SHIB’s movement remains tied to hype and community-driven pushes. While recent metrics offer encouragement, long-term gains depend on consistent use cases. Without stronger foundations, SHIB’s future may remain speculative. BlockDAG (BDAG): Building Utility and Global Presence BlockDAG is combining strong infrastructure with cultural appeal, showing that scale and relevance can grow side by side. Its hybrid framework blends blockchain and DAG technology to achieve fast, scalable, and efficient transactions. Full EVM compatibility, low-code smart contracts, and green mining solutions make it appealing across developer and user communities. It’s not just for creating apps, it’s designed to be adopted widely. Ease of access further boosts its presence. Over 1.5 million users are earning BDAG daily through the X1 app, which allows mining up to 20 coins per day via smartphones. Advanced mining rigs like X10, X30, and X100 hardware offer up to 2,000 BDAG daily, giving individuals powerful tools usually reserved for large-scale setups. The recent tease of an NBA deal has sparked curiosity about where BDAG could go next, possibly into global entertainment, merchandise, and fan networks. This type of exposure, rare at this stage, could place BDAG in front of new audiences. Now in Stage 28 of presale, BDAG has sold 22.1 billion coins and raised $291 million. Each coin is priced at $0.0018 until June 13’s GO LIVE reveal event, whereas the confirmed listing price of BDAG is $0.05. The coin has marked a 2,520% rise since Batch 1. With the GO LIVE reveal happening soon, BDAG’s rise looks more like a breakout moment than just another presale. In a Nutshell! Pi Network’s early promise has been clouded by slow progress and missing timelines. Shiba Inu benefits from its loyal base and short-term momentum, yet remains tied to community mood swings. BlockDAG is cutting through the noise with rapid user growth, functional tools, and a unique NBA Deal tease that’s attracting attention across sectors. With 1.5 million miners using the X1 app, green mining equipment, and a GO LIVE reveal scheduled, BlockDAG is positioning itself ahead of many projects. The project’s $291 million crypto presale 2025 boom and 2,520% ROI since Batch 1 reflect more than speculation, it shows momentum built on delivery. For those eyeing 2025’s breakout digital asset, the difference is clear: Pi is waiting, SHIB is watching, but BDAG is already moving.

This development is particularly noteworthy as it involves a considerable sum and a specialized funding mechanism. Who is The Blockchain Group and Why This Deal Matters? The Blockchain Group operates in the dynamic blockchain sector, focusing on various applications of distributed ledger technology. For any company in a rapidly evolving market, securing flexible and substantial funding is crucial for growth and strategic initiatives. This €300 million ($342.78 million) agreement represents a major financial injection that signals strong intent regarding their balance sheet strategy. The deal, formalized through an At The Market (ATM) capital increase agreement with asset manager TOBAM, is designed specifically to support the company’s strategic decision to increase its holdings of Bitcoin (BTC). By doing so, The Blockchain Group aims to enhance its Bitcoin treasury strategy, effectively increasing the amount of BTC held per share. Understanding the ATM Capital Increase Mechanism An ATM capital increase is a type of public offering where a company can sell newly issued shares into the existing market over a period of time at prevailing market prices. Unlike traditional underwritten offerings where shares are sold at a fixed price to a group of investors, an ATM offering provides companies with flexibility and control over the timing and volume of shares sold. Here’s a simple breakdown of how an ATM works: Flexibility: The company can choose when and how many shares to sell, reacting to market conditions. Efficiency: It can be a cost-effective way to raise capital compared to other methods. Market Price: Shares are sold at or near the current market price, avoiding the need for a large discount often required in traditional offerings. Gradual Funding: Capital is raised incrementally over time rather than in one lump sum. For The Blockchain Group , this €300 million ATM agreement allows them to raise funds gradually by selling shares, with the explicit purpose of using the proceeds to acquire Bitcoin for their Bitcoin treasury. This method provides the company with the means to accumulate BTC strategically over a period, potentially mitigating the impact of short-term price volatility compared to a single large purchase. The Strategic Shift: Building a Bitcoin Treasury The concept of a Bitcoin treasury involves a corporation holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet as a reserve asset, similar to how companies have historically held cash, gold, or other traditional assets. This strategy gained significant traction in recent years, popularized by companies like MicroStrategy. Companies adopting a Bitcoin treasury strategy often cite several key reasons: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply is seen by many as protection against the devaluation of fiat currencies due to inflation. Store of Value: It is viewed as a digital form of gold, capable of preserving value over the long term. Potential Appreciation: Companies anticipate that the value of Bitcoin will increase over time, boosting their balance sheet strength. Attracting Talent/Investors: Holding Bitcoin can appeal to a growing segment of employees and investors who are bullish on digital assets. By increasing its Bitcoin treasury, The Blockchain Group is positioning itself within this forward-thinking corporate trend, signaling confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term asset and potentially offering its shareholders exposure to BTC’s performance. Broader Implications for Corporate Bitcoin Adoption This €300 million ATM deal is not just significant for The Blockchain Group ; it also contributes to the broader narrative of corporate Bitcoin adoption. When publicly traded companies utilize sophisticated financial instruments like ATM offerings specifically to fund Bitcoin acquisitions, it lends further legitimacy to Bitcoin as a viable corporate asset. While pioneers like MicroStrategy aggressively converted large portions of their cash reserves into Bitcoin, other companies have taken more measured approaches. Deals like this one by The Blockchain Group demonstrate alternative, flexible methods companies can employ to build their Bitcoin treasury over time, using equity financing rather than solely relying on existing cash reserves. However, the path of holding corporate Bitcoin is not without its challenges. Companies must navigate accounting complexities, regulatory uncertainties, and, perhaps most significantly, the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. A sudden downturn in Bitcoin’s price can negatively impact a company’s balance sheet and stock price, as seen with some early adopters. What This Means for Crypto Investment and the Market From the perspective of crypto investment , this deal is a positive signal. A €300 million commitment, even if deployed over time, represents substantial institutional demand for Bitcoin. Such large-scale corporate buying can contribute to price stability and growth by reducing the available supply on exchanges. For investors interested in gaining exposure to Bitcoin through traditional equity markets, companies like The Blockchain Group that hold significant BTC on their balance sheets can become attractive options. The value of their shares may, to some extent, become correlated with the performance of Bitcoin itself, offering a different avenue for crypto investment. The involvement of TOBAM, an asset manager, in facilitating this ATM agreement also highlights the increasing comfort level of traditional financial institutions in participating in deals related to digital assets. This collaboration between a blockchain company, an asset manager, and the public markets via an ATM offering showcases the evolving landscape of corporate finance intersecting with the world of crypto investment. Benefits of the Deal Funding for Strategic Asset Acquisition: Provides substantial capital specifically earmarked for increasing Bitcoin holdings. Flexibility in Execution: ATM structure allows for opportunistic buying based on market conditions. Potential Balance Sheet Enhancement: Successful Bitcoin treasury strategy can increase asset value. Shareholder Alignment: Appeals to shareholders bullish on Bitcoin and digital assets. Potential Challenges and Risks Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price fluctuations directly impact the value of the treasury holdings. Share Dilution: Selling new shares via the ATM can dilute the ownership stake of existing shareholders. Execution Risk: Successfully deploying €300M into BTC requires careful market timing and execution. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for corporate crypto holdings is still evolving. Conclusion The Blockchain Group ‘s €300 million ATM agreement with TOBAM marks a significant milestone in its strategic development and the broader trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption. By leveraging this flexible funding mechanism, the company is positioning itself to substantially increase its Bitcoin treasury, signaling strong conviction in the digital asset’s long-term value. While challenges related to market volatility and potential dilution exist, this move underscores the increasing integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional corporate finance and represents a notable crypto investment strategy by a publicly listed company. This deal serves as a compelling example of how companies are finding innovative ways to incorporate Bitcoin into their financial architecture, potentially paving the way for further corporate adoption in the future.

Specifically, Master Ananda’s analysis highlighted a confirmed higher low formation on June 5, followed by strong bullish price action on June 8. This suggests that XRP has resumed its upward trend after spending a month consolidating. Notably, June 5 marked one of XRP’s steepest drops in recent weeks, briefly threatening to fall below $2. In a June 8 TradingView post , Ananda pointed to April 7 as a local bottom and May 12 as the most recent peak. The 24-day retracement between those dates, followed by 27 days of sideways movement, signals a classic buildup phase before a potential breakout. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView According to Ananda , this consolidation has allowed the market to reset, positioning XRP for a major move higher. His price target is $4.51, bypassing interim resistance zones like $2.71 and $3.02. If this projection holds, XRP could rally directly to the $4.5 area by early August, which is expected to act as a major resistance once tested. Meanwhile, XRP has already made a sharp recovery from its recent lows, at one point adding $6 billion in market cap in a single day. However, it has yet to reclaim the $2.30 resistance, a level that would open the door to challenging the crucial $2.50 mark. XRP price resurgence It’s worth noting that a surge in on-chain activity is fueling this momentum. For instance, XRP’s 24-hour trading volume has spiked nearly 50%, reaching $2.7 billion, signaling strong and sustained investor interest. On the other hand, institutional interest in XRP is likely to pick up. In this case, on June 2, Nasdaq proposed adding XRP to its flagship Nasdaq Crypto Index (NCI). If approved, this move would align the holdings of the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF (NCIQ) with the broader index, potentially bringing more institutional capital into XRP. XRP price analysis At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.26, down 0.3% on the day but up over 5% for the week. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold From a technical standpoint, XRP is hovering just below its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $2.30 but remains well above the 200-day SMA, which is at $1.90. This indicates short-term consolidation within a broader bullish trend. Meanwhile, the 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) sits at 53.3—reflecting neutral momentum with a slight bullish tilt.

BiT Global, a crypto exchange with ties to TRON founder Justin Sun, has decided to drop its legal action against the major U.S. exchange, Coinbase. What Was the Coinbase Lawsuit All About? The now-dropped legal challenge stemmed from Coinbase’s decision to delist Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC). BiT Global initially filed the lawsuit in December, taking issue with Coinbase’s move regarding the popular token. While the specifics of BiT Global’s original complaint weren’t extensively detailed in the initial reports, lawsuits of this nature often revolve around claims of improper procedure, lack of sufficient notice, or potential damages incurred by the delisting party due to the exchange’s action. Delisting can impact liquidity, trading volume, and the perceived legitimacy of an asset, which could potentially affect businesses that hold or facilitate trading of that asset. The filing of the suit itself highlighted the increasing frequency of legal disputes within the crypto industry as platforms and protocols navigate complex relationships and operational decisions in a largely unregulated or newly regulated landscape. Who is BiT Global and Why Does it Matter? BiT Global is a cryptocurrency exchange based in Hong Kong. Its significance in this context is largely amplified by its prominent backing: none other than Justin Sun, the well-known founder of the TRON blockchain and a figure often involved in various crypto ventures and public discussions. Sun’s involvement often brings additional attention to projects and disputes. As a vocal and active participant in the crypto space, his backing of BiT Global meant this particular lawsuit against a major player like Coinbase garnered notable interest from the community and industry observers. It wasn’t just a dispute between two exchanges; it involved a personality with significant influence. Understanding wBTC Delisting and Its Impact To grasp why a wBTC delisting would trigger a lawsuit, it’s important to understand what wBTC is. Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) is an ERC-20 token that represents Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain. It’s designed to bring Bitcoin’s liquidity and value into the Ethereum ecosystem, allowing it to be used in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications like lending, borrowing, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Key points about wBTC: It’s backed 1:1 by Bitcoin held in custody. It enables BTC holders to participate in Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem. Merchants (like custodians and exchanges) mint and burn wBTC. When a major exchange like Coinbase decides to delist an asset, even one as significant as wBTC (in terms of its underlying value), it can have several consequences: Reduced Liquidity: Traders on that specific platform lose the ability to easily buy or sell the asset. Price Impact: Delisting can sometimes lead to price volatility or a drop on other platforms if users rush to sell. Accessibility Issues: Users holding the asset on the delisting exchange must transfer it elsewhere, potentially incurring fees or facing inconvenience. Signal to Market: While wBTC’s core function remains, a delisting by a major player might be interpreted in various ways by the market, though given wBTC’s nature, a single exchange delisting is less impactful than for a smaller altcoin. For a business like BiT Global, which operates as an exchange itself, a delisting on a platform like Coinbase could potentially affect their users who interact with wBTC or create ripple effects in the broader market that impact their operations or holdings. The Abrupt End: Why Drop the Crypto Lawsuit ? The decision by BiT Global to drop the crypto lawsuit against Coinbase is perhaps the most intriguing part of this story. Lawsuits, especially between significant entities, are often lengthy, costly, and complex affairs. Dropping a suit after filing typically suggests one of several possibilities: Settlement: The parties may have reached an out-of-court settlement. The terms of such settlements are usually confidential, but it would involve some form of agreement or compensation resolving the dispute. Lack of Strong Case: BiT Global’s legal team may have reviewed the case further and determined that their claims were unlikely to succeed in court. Continuing would be a waste of resources. Strategic Decision: The lawsuit may have served its purpose (e.g., drawing attention to the issue, opening a channel for negotiation), and continuing the legal battle was no longer strategically beneficial for BiT Global or Justin Sun. Cost Considerations: Litigation is expensive. The potential costs of pursuing the lawsuit through trial may have outweighed the potential benefits or recovery. Without official statements from either party regarding the reason for dropping the suit, the exact cause remains speculative. However, the swiftness with which the suit was dropped (filed in December, dropped relatively soon after) might suggest an early settlement or a rapid strategic reassessment. The Role of Justin Sun in the Legal Landscape Justin Sun is no stranger to legal or regulatory attention. His various projects, including TRON and the stablecoin USDD, have sometimes been the subject of scrutiny or legal challenges. His involvement in this BiT Global case adds another layer to his public profile as a figure actively navigating the complex and sometimes fraught legal environment surrounding cryptocurrency. While he was not the direct plaintiff (BiT Global was), his backing of the exchange makes him an influential figure behind the scenes of this particular legal skirmish. The decision to drop the suit would almost certainly have had his involvement or approval. What Does This Mean Going Forward? For Coinbase, the dropping of the suit means one less legal challenge to contend with. While they face various regulatory and legal pressures, the resolution of this specific dispute allows them to focus on other operational and legal matters. For BiT Global and Justin Sun, it signifies the end of a particular legal strategy related to the wBTC delisting. It doesn’t necessarily indicate a change in their stance on the importance of asset accessibility but rather the conclusion of this specific approach to address the issue. More broadly, this incident serves as a reminder of the dynamic and often unpredictable legal landscape in the crypto industry. Exchanges’ listing and delisting decisions can have real-world consequences and sometimes lead to legal challenges, though these challenges don’t always proceed to a full trial. Conclusion The Coinbase lawsuit initiated by BiT Global over the wBTC delisting has concluded with BiT Global dropping its claims. This decision, likely influenced by factors ranging from potential settlement talks to strategic considerations or legal assessments, brings a swift end to a legal battle that highlighted the complexities faced by crypto exchanges and related businesses. While the exact reasons remain private, the outcome avoids a potentially protracted and costly legal fight for both parties, adding another notable chapter to the evolving history of crypto lawsuit cases involving major industry figures like Justin Sun .

As ASIC machines skyrocketed in price, the average person was locked out of the rewards. Today, a competitive Bitcoin mining setup can cost $15,000 or more—just for the hardware. But in 2025, a quiet revolution is underway. Enter Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S): a next-generation blockchain that allows anyone to participate in mining using a device they already own—thanks to the upcoming release of its mobile-first mining experience. And this isn’t just a minor innovation. It could completely reshape how wealth is distributed in crypto—removing the barriers that Bitcoin’s infrastructure never solved. Bitcoin Set the Standard—But Only for the Few Bitcoin created the blueprint for digital wealth. But over time, it became increasingly centralized. Mining power was consumed by massive farms in energy-rich regions. Hardware became harder to access, louder, hotter, and more expensive. That’s why Bitcoin’s system, while still effective, has become a gated playground for the ultra-prepared. Bitcoin Solaris changes the rules. It brings mining back to the people—without compromising on security, decentralization, or profitability. Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Solaris: The Mining Gap Feature Bitcoin Bitcoin Solaris Mining Access ASIC-only, ~$15K hardware Desktop, browser, mobile-ready Consensus Proof-of-Work PoW (Base) + DPoS (Solaris Layer) Energy Consumption Very high 99.95% lower Smart Contract Support None Rust-based, fully audited Validator Rotation Not applicable Every 24 hours Entry Barrier High Minimal The Architecture That Makes It All Work At the core of Bitcoin Solaris is a dual-layer consensus design that solves the blockchain trilemma—speed, security, and decentralization—in a single structure. Proof-of-Work Base Layer: Runs on SHA-256, making it compatible with traditional Bitcoin mining gear Delegated Proof-of-Stake Solaris Layer: 21 validators elected by stakers, rotating every 24 hours Block Time: 15 seconds on the Solaris Layer, with finality in 2 seconds Scalability: Supports over 100,000 transactions per second Energy Efficiency: Uses 99.95% less energy than Bitcoin while maintaining PoW integrity Crypto Mining Just Got Simpler, Smarter, and Mobile—Join BTC-S This setup ensures that mobile users can securely contribute to the network without needing industrial-grade tools. Technical Proof and Audit-Backed Confidence One of the most important differentiators for Bitcoin Solaris is its credibility. Its smart contracts have been independently audited by Cyberscope and Freshcoins , and passed with flying colors. These audits covered everything from block finality mechanisms to staking logic and validator incentives—ensuring the network is ready for real-world scale and enterprise-grade reliability. The Presale Is Heating Up Fast Bitcoin Solaris is now in Phase 7 of its limited-time presale , with the token currently priced at $7. The next phase will raise the price to $8, and a $20 launch price is confirmed. Investors are moving quickly, drawn in by: More than $3.8 million already raised Over 11,000 unique users onboarded Less than 8 weeks left before the presale ends One of the shortest and most explosive crypto launches of the year Unlike Bitcoin, which was mined before most people even knew what it was, Bitcoin Solaris is being adopted in real time—before the full release. How Bitcoin Solaris Is Creating a New Class of Wealth Builders The biggest opportunity in crypto is early participation. But until now, early access meant complex staking, expensive rigs, or deep technical knowledge. Bitcoin Solaris simplifies everything. You can mine or stake using a standard device Validators rotate, giving smaller users real opportunity Block rewards go to contributors—not just large-scale farms Network mechanics reward time-weighted engagement and active participation It’s not about hype. It’s about utility. As 2Bit Crypto noted in a recent video , Bitcoin Solaris is built to generate wealth for those who plug in—not just those who hold. The Road Ahead: What’s Next for BTC-S Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just a whitepaper—it’s a working ecosystem with a defined roadmap and a team hitting milestone after milestone. Here’s a quick summary of what’s happening: Q2–Q4 2025: Token launched, presale opens, protocol development underway Q1 2026: Testnet launches, validator tools and wallets released, bridge to Solana finalized Q2 2026: Mainnet deployment prep and developer ecosystem opens Q3 2026 and beyond: Mainnet live, DEX launches, Fortune 500 partnerships in progress Every step brings more infrastructure online—and pushes Bitcoin Solaris closer to its vision of universal, accessible blockchain power. Crypto Isn’t Just for Whales Anymore Bitcoin was revolutionary—but it required heavy upfront investment to benefit. Bitcoin Solaris takes that foundation and rewires it for accessibility. With the ability to mine and earn from your browser, laptop, or phone, this blockchain is giving everyday users the tools they were previously denied. It’s fast. It’s fair. And it’s only just getting started.

The average purchase price was $105,426 per Bitcoin ( BTC ). With this move, the company’s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at 582,000 BTC, worth over $62 billion at current market prices. The acquisition, conducted between June 2 and June 8, was financed through proceeds from Strategy’s recent $1 billion preferred stock offering. The company issued 11.76 million shares of its 10% Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock at $85 per share, aiming to raise capital for further Bitcoin purchases and general corporate expenses. Strategy expects to net $979 million after deducting underwriting and related costs. Notably, co-founder Michael Saylor did not sell any company stock to fund the $110 million Bitcoin purchase; the entire amount was raised through at-the-market sales of Strategy’s STRK and STRF preferred stock offerings, according to the filing.

Co-founder Michael Saylor hinted at the latest buy in a June 8 post on social media, ahead of the official filing. Bitcoin was trading at around $107,640 on Monday, close to its all-time high of $112,000 recorded in May. The firm began its Bitcoin accumulation strategy in August 2020 with a $250 million investment and has since amassed 2.75% of all Bitcoin that will ever be mined. Strategy’s market cap has soared from $1.2 billion in 2020 to $104.6 billion today. Its strategy aligns with a growing trend among public companies using Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Interest from corporations in digital assets is increasing , with more and more public companies allocating Bitcoin to their balance sheets, according to a recent report from Binance. Other similar moves come from companies like Japan’s Metaplanet and France’s The Blockchain Group, all of which have seen their stock prices surge after shifting to Bitcoin-centric treasury models.

(Lawyer Explains),https://cryptopotato.com/is-bitcoin-a-better-buy-now-than-it-was-at-20k-lawyer-explains/,"TL;DR Bitcoin at its current value is seen by some as a “safer buy” than at $20,000, supported by expectations of rising debt from new economic policies and accelerating institutional and nation-state adoption. Factors like negative exchange netflows, a stable MVRV ratio, and a record 55 million BTC holders point to potential for further price growth. Is BTC Now a ‘Safer Buy?’ John Deaton, an American attorney who represents thousands of XRP investors in the lawsuit between Ripple and the US SEC, recently expressed an interesting opinion regarding the primary cryptocurrency. He shared a post by David Bailey (Chairman of Bitcoin Magazine), who recently urged people to “get as much capital” and use it to purchase Bitcoin (BTC). While Deaton said he is not in favor of telling individuals to take out loans to buy crypto, he argued that the leading digital asset at a price of $106,000 seems like a “safer buy” than it was at $20,000. He backed his theory with the likely passage of the Build Back Better (BBB) economic initiative and the GENIUS Act, predicting they would lead to the printing of fiat money and “skyrocketing” debt. The lawyer added that this possible development, combined with rapid institutional and nation-state adoption, makes buying BTC at current prices “more asymmetrical” than it was at $25,000. “But I’ll fully admit I suffer from both confirmation and wealth-preservation bias,” Deaton concluded. Further Pump Incoming? BTC trading above the psychological level of $100,000 might still seem surreal to some members of the crypto community, who have been waiting for that milestone for years. Moreover, some key factors suggest that the asset may experience an additional rally in the short term. For instance, the BTC exchange netflow has been predominantly negative in the past months, suggesting that investors have shifted from centralized exchanged toward self-custody methods. This , in turn, reduces the immediate selling pressure. BTC Exchange Netflow, Source: CryptoQuant Bitcoin’s MVRV, which compares the asset’s market capitalization to its realized capitalization and helps traders identify whether the asset is undervalued or overvalued, is also worth observing. Over the past few weeks, the ratio has been fluctuating within the healthy range of 2 to 2.5, suggesting there is still potential for further appreciation. According to CryptoQuant, historical data shows that readings above 3.70 have typically signaled market peaks, whereas values below 1 have indicated bottoms. BTC MVRV, Source: CryptoQuant Last but not least, the total number of BTC holders recently hit a new all-time high of over 55 million, signaling growing adoption and higher demand for the asset.

The Justice Department's June 2025 civil forfeiture complaint describes a digital laundering arrangement that not only circumvented U.S. sanctions but highlights how vulnerabilities in crypto exchange know-your-customer protocols remain a national security threat. The script for the scheme reads like the pages of a cyber-thriller. North Korean actors, posing as freelance blockchain developers or smart contract developers, used stolen or fictitious U.S. identities to gain employment with U.S. and foreign technology companies. These workers, part of legitimate businesses, were paid salaries in stablecoins like USDC and USDT, which were then run through a web of self-hosted wallets, chain-hopping across blockchains, and ultimately consolidated in addresses under the control of Pyongyang. The DOJ complaint names over 84 exchange accounts linked to the laundering ring, a number of which were opened using fake KYC documents and recycled devices, rendering the operation both global and highly organized. Investigators followed the laundering channels step by step: funds moved from U.S. payrolls to ”IT Worker Consolidation Addresses,” then to accounts in the names of Russian and Malaysian pseudonyms, and finally to North Korean handlers like Sim Hyon Sop and Kim Sang Man — both of whom have been sanctioned by OFAC for their role in the regime's illicit finance. The network even utilized NFTs and Ethereum Name Service domains to disguise value transfers, a tactic being increasingly exploited in the crypto underworld. The case is a wake-up call for both the crypto industry and national security agencies. Despite the FBI and Treasury's repeated warnings since 2022, North Korean IT worker scams have only gotten more sophisticated, infiltrating even Fortune 500 companies and blockchain startups. The DOJ's ability to trace and seize the funds frozen since an earlier 2023 indictment marks an advance in blockchain forensics, but also illustrates the ongoing threat: as long as exchanges' KYC and transaction monitoring can be gamed, bad actors will find ways to exploit the system. This forfeiture action highlights, once again, the North Korean regime's reliance on the cryptocurrency market to fund its illicit priorities,” said Matthew Galeotti, head of the DOJ's Criminal Division. OFAC is bound to increase sanctions, not just to individuals but to exchanges and brokers used for laundering, knowingly or unknowingly. Compliance experts say the industry must move beyond blacklist checks, embracing real-time analytics, device fingerprinting, and behavioral monitoring to identify spoofed identities and organized laundering. As one AML consultant put it, ”The weakest KYC link is now a national security vulnerability.”. The DOJ complaint also outlines the extent and range of North Korea's IT worker scam: agents were not only based in China and Russia, but in the UAE and beyond, exploiting the global shift to remote work. The researchers found that the same hardware and login credentials were re-used for multiple fake personas, and language defaults were often Korean — further evidence of a state-sponsored, concerted campaign. The seized assets do not only include cryptocurrencies, but also NFTs and Ethereum Name Service domains of high value, pointing to North Korea's expansion of digital laundering techniques.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|REGULATION|ENS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-09 15:28:08

Deeper into Q3, leading altcoins ADA and XRP are picking up serious steam, and Remittix is quickly proving to be the dark horse of the cycle. XRP, Cardano Price Rally Points to Bullish Outlook The rise in price in Cardano and XRP reflects enhanced investors' confidence. Cardano (ADA) has a price of $0.6760 with an 1.40% rise in the last 24 hours. Its market cap is $23.89 billion with a higher trading volume of 18.65% at $480.94 million. ADA is starting to appear bullish all over again. Meanwhile, XRP is making even more noise, shooting up 4.46% to $2.28. Its market cap now stands at $134.11 billion, and its daily trading volume surged 101.61%, now crossing $2.5 billion. This strong demand suggests whales and institutions could be quietly accumulating in anticipation of a bigger move. Historically, such upticks in trading volume precede massive breakouts during a bull run. Why Remittix (RTX) Is Stealing the Spotlight in Q3 While big caps like ADA and XRP are gaining momentum, Remittix (RTX) is under the radar as one of the most promising projects of the year. Remittix enables users to send cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and XRP directly to conventional bank accounts in minutes. The cryptocurrency-to-fiat bridge solves a substantial real-world problem: real-time global payments without centralized financial networks. What's exciting investors is the pace of development. The Remittix wallet was recently revealed, with a Q3 release planned, which can send the token price skyrocketing. This kind of update shows the team is developing fast, which gives confidence to investors. Remittix is also offering a 50% token bonus during its presale. The project is closing in on its $18 million softcap, with $15.5 million+ already collected and over 541 million tokens sold. This aggressive bonus and strong early traction suggest that Remittix could 10x by the end of the year. With a price of $0.0781 at the time of writing, RTX offers an inexpensive entry with colossal upside potential. This will be especially appealing to investors who weren't able to get on the early boat for coins like Ripple and Stellar. ADA, XRP and RTX: A Diversified Q3 Portfolio? A smart play in Q3 could be diversifying between established giants like XRP and ADA, and volcanic newcomers like RTX. XRP and Cardano price appreciation continues to appear promising due to their strong ecosystems. Cardano is working on scaling and smart contract improvements, and XRP is improving global banking through Ripple partnerships. But projects like Remittix can bring faster gains over shorter periods of time. With its unique position in the $190 trillion global payments market, RTX is being compared to early-stage Ripple — but with the potential for faster adoption. Imagine being able to send ETH to your family overseas and having it arrive in their bank account in 3 minutes — no third-party fees, no waiting. That's the kind of ease Remittix is bringing, and something that XRP and ADA haven't quite worked out as yet. Q3 Could Be the Last Entry Point The XRP, Cardano price run combined with Remittix's rapid rise paints a clear picture: Q3 may be your last low-risk chance to get in before everything goes parabolic. XRP and ADA have track records, institutional investment, and market caps to back up their bull cases. But for 10x or even 20x gains, Remittix is the token with the most glaring immediate use case and nearest-term upside. With a product going live in Q3, strong investor momentum, and a bonus offer still active, RTX might be the top altcoin sleeper choice going into the next crypto boom. If you want to supercharge gains this year, following all three — ADA, XRP, and RTX — might be the strongest portfolio move you can make.

Understanding the Surge in Cardano and XRP Both XRP and Cardano have demonstrated commendable growth this quarter. Cardano has recently seen a price increase, currently standing at $0.6760, which marks a 1.40% rise. Its market cap has reached $23.89 billion, with a noticeable bump in trading volume. This uptick in investor interest suggests a bullish sentiment building around ADA. Similarly, XRP has shown an impressive gain of 4.46%, elevating its price to $2.28 with a market cap of $134.11 billion. Its daily trading volume has surged by over 100%, indicating strong market confidence and possible preparation for a larger market move. Spotlight on Remittix: The Dark Horse of Q3 The rising star of this quarter, however, is Remittix , a platform facilitating cryptocurrency transactions directly to traditional bank accounts. This capability is especially significant as it addresses the real-time global payment needs without relying on centralized financial institutions. Remittix is not just innovating; it's also enticing investors with a 50% token bonus during its current presale, racing towards its $18 million soft cap with more than $15.5 million already raised. With its aggressive market entry and robust development, the RTX token is poised for potential exponential growth. The current price stands at a mere $0.0781, offering an attractive entry point for investors looking for substantial future returns. Strategic Portfolio Diversification: ADA, XRP, and RTX For investors aiming to maximize returns, diversifying with XRP and ADA's stability alongside RTX's explosive growth potential could be a strategic move. While ADA and XRP contribute solid foundations and proven market resilience, RTX offers a unique growth trajectory based on its innovative solution to a common market problem. Final Thoughts The bullish signals from ADA and XRP, combined with the strategic advantages offered by RTX, indicate that Q3 might indeed be the optimal time for investors to strengthen their portfolios before potential market shifts lead to higher entry barriers.

Tether mints $1B USDT, fueling ongoing debates about stablecoins’ impact on Bitcoin prices. Ripple CTO David “JoelKatz” Schwartz has responded to several questions on social media about his involvement with Evan “all the money” Schwartz. The user “DegenXRPHolder” wondered if the two had a relationship. Schwartz pointed out that just because they have the same last name, they are not related. However, he acknowledged that there is another Evan connected to Interledger who is a member of his family. The discussion then shifted to the current functioning of Interledger. Schwartz stated that the protocol may have been too advanced for its time. He added that being too soon can sometimes be as bad as being too late.

Dogecoin is being held back by a huge liquidity wall, Chainlink is much lower than its promise to institutions, and Remittix , backed by $15.6 million raised, is just $2.4 million short of its $18 million soft-cap and provides a cheap way to use PayFi in the real world. Furthermore, Pi Network’s chart suggests that a surprise rebound will take place as soon as its token-unlock phase ends. Dogecoin: Liquidity Walls and Classic Reversal Setups Source: Alphratical . DOGE currently trades near $0.19 People engaged in Dogecoin trading are closely watching Alphractal’s heat-map, where they see a $380 million group of short liquidations waiting at $0.50. Over time, Dogecoin has always seen a big surge after briefly dropping below such a liquidity level. A new inverse Head-and-Shoulders shape is visible on the chart; the price hit the $0.17 support level, revisited it, and started using it as support. On the Elliott Wave theory, analysts have Dogecoin in Wave 4, and Wave 5 may send the price past the half-dollar level. People who buy coins continue to look at the coin’s green support band, which has remained steady since 2021. A climb in Bitcoin could lead to a surge in buyers among the short-sellers, causing Dogecoin to shoot up fast and reach the heights it saw in 2021. However, there’s another question: Will investors pick Dogecoin again, or should they focus on other low-cost projects that have more use? It could decide if Dogecoin once again becomes the top meme-coin or if PayFi joins it as a main story in the crypto world. Chainlink: Institutional Bridges to the Real-World Asset Boom Source: coingecko. Chainlink currently trades near $13.93 Chainlink keeps attracting institutional investments, and each news story makes it clear that the price near $13.94 is still a bargain. Mentioning tokenized real estate in fiat by BlackRock means Chainlink oracles are making it possible for off-line payments to affect on-chain ownership records. Using Chainlink CCIP, Maple Finance makes it possible for liquidity to move between Solana and 57 other blockchains, something that Chainlink is the only one able to do on a large scale. Even the regulators agree: EU MiCA programs mention Chainlink’s data standards, and the SEC has started including Chainlink in its drafts on RWA. The market price is not catching up to expectations; the 50-day SMA is stopping any major gains and traders seek a close above $14.00. Whenever volume increases, Chainlink is usually the first to rise, thanks to Bitcoin or Ethereum. Remittix: The Wallet-Ready PayFi Gem Racing Past XRP Dogecoin tries to find more investors while Chainlink searches for more users, but Remittix is already getting momentum. The new wallet introduced by the team lets Bitcoin, Ether, or XRP be transferred to a bank account in under ten seconds and for very little cost. PayFi uses Ethereum gas and returns micro-fees to RTX holders, thereby removing tokens every day. As bonuses are set to end in less than two weeks, buyers who use $2.4 million get an extra 50 percent tokens and pay only about 5 cents per token. PayFi’s public launch is scheduled for Q3 2025, and two deals in Asia and Latin America are being investigated by due diligence. The fact that early whales have moved from $0.08 to one dollar with a 12× increase shows that Remittix could easily reach this milestone. If we finish the soft-cap in this month, marketing and trading will be activated as soon as the wallet is live, so RTX will be ahead of similar coins in the market. Pi Network: Triple-Bottom Tension Versus Token-Unlock Gravity Source: crypto.news . PI currently trades near $0.63 Pi Network is now watched by contrarians because of its slanted triple-bottom and bullish divergence on the eight-hour chart. Bulls are counting on these signals to cause a big move, but the amount of tokens being released, 68 million this week and 275 million more in the next 30 days, makes everything more complicated. Net exchange inflows indicate that people are selling and withdrawing coins, but Banxa’s link to fiat and a new $100 million fund for Pi Network Ventures should attract additional developers. Pi can reach the same level of growth as Dogecoin, Chainlink, or Remittix by being listed on major exchanges, which has not happened yet. Why Remittix Tops June’s Value List If Dogecoin’s liquidity overhead is finally removed, its price could skyrocket; Chainlink is in a good position to lead in tokenization, and Pi Network could see its chart turn up if pressure to unlock eases. However, only Remittix has a very low entry point, plus a specific launch date, constant burning, and a closing window for bonuses that ensures the project will be scarce right away. When it comes to the market’s focus on gains and key events, Remittix leaves June’s top crypto far behind, so now is the best time to invest in RTX before PayFi takes off and others follow from behind.

This kind of activity always catches the eye of market watchers, sparking discussions about what it could mean for the assets involved and the broader market. According to data from Arkham, a total of 23,075 ETH , valued at approximately $57.48 million at the time of the transfer, alongside a massive 541.1 billion PEPE tokens, worth around $6.22 million, were moved. The transfer originated from Ceffu ’s hot wallet and landed on the Binance Exchange roughly 35 minutes before the data was reported. These are substantial amounts, totaling over $63.7 million. Understanding Ceffu’s Role in Institutional Crypto So, what exactly is Ceffu ? Think of it as the secure vault for big players in the crypto space. It’s Binance ‘s institutional custody platform, designed specifically for large investors, funds, and corporations that need a safe place to store their digital assets for the long term. Unlike individual retail wallets or even exchange hot wallets, Ceffu focuses on providing robust security and compliance features tailored for institutional needs. Transfers from Ceffu , particularly to an active exchange like Binance , are noteworthy precisely because Ceffu is typically where assets are held for storage , not immediate trading. Why Large Binance Transfers Grab Attention Whenever large sums of cryptocurrency move onto a major exchange like Binance , it naturally triggers market speculation. Exchanges are the primary venues for buying and selling digital assets. Therefore, moving funds to an exchange is often seen as a precursor to selling activity. This is why the Ceffu to Binance transfer immediately raised questions among analysts tracking on-chain movements. While the transfer itself doesn’t confirm a sale, it positions the assets in a place where selling is easily facilitated. Interpreting This Significant Crypto Transfer While a move from custody to an exchange is often interpreted as a potential ‘sell signal’, it’s crucial to understand that the picture is rarely that simple. This particular Crypto Transfer could signify several different things: Potential Selling: The most straightforward interpretation is that the institutional holder using Ceffu intends to sell some or all of the transferred ETH and PEPE on Binance . The scale of the transfer ($63.7M) is significant enough to potentially impact market prices if executed as a large market sell order. Market Making Activities: Institutions often engage in market making to provide liquidity on exchanges. Moving assets to Binance could be preparation for fulfilling buy or sell orders as part of a market-making strategy. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Trading: Large block trades are often executed off-exchange via OTC desks to minimize market impact. The assets might be moved to Binance ‘s OTC desk or a related account to facilitate such a private sale. Internal Wallet Rebalancing: Large entities manage multiple wallets for different purposes (hot wallets for trading, cold wallets for storage, institutional custody). This transfer could simply be an internal movement to consolidate funds, prepare for a specific operational need, or rebalance holdings across different storage solutions, including moving assets closer to liquidity venues like Binance . Given Ceffu ‘s focus on institutional clients, any of these scenarios are plausible. Without further information from Ceffu or Binance , or subsequent on-chain activity from the receiving addresses, it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact reason behind this substantial Crypto Transfer . The Assets Involved: ETH and PEPE The transfer included both ETH and PEPE , two assets with very different market profiles. ETH , or Ethereum, is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, underpinning a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications, NFTs, and DeFi protocols. PEPE , on the other hand, is a popular meme coin, known for its high volatility and community-driven nature. The inclusion of both assets in a large institutional transfer is interesting and suggests the holder has a diversified position that includes both established large-cap crypto and more speculative assets like meme coins. Ultimately, while the transfer of over $63 million in ETH and PEPE from Ceffu to Binance is a notable event, its exact implications remain open to interpretation. It highlights the significant movements happening behind the scenes involving institutional players and major exchanges. Market participants should be aware of such large transfers but avoid jumping to conclusions about imminent price action based solely on this data point.

As blockchain technology adoption grows, the crypto industry has become complex and competitive. Investors are now looking for projects that promise rewards, development, and decentralization. Neo Pepe is a project that focuses on meme coins with serious actions against centralized traditional platforms. Neo Pepe presents a strong movement, community backing, and profitable interest rates. Investors have also been monitoring its presale because of its plans to change the blockchain investment ecosystem and redefine crypto strategies. Boundless Excitement Surrounding Neo Pepe The excitement surrounding the Neo Pepe project is not built on hype–it is grounded in the platform’s design and the involvement of its community. Its presale structure provides profits for early investors, rewarding them as the price of the token continues to rise. In addition, the platform’s auto-liquidity and governance mechanism positions Neo Pepe not as another opportunity to make profits, but as a foundational digital asset that will be in the market for the long term. With this approach, Neo Pepe is in line with what investors want, providing them with security and dynamism in an unpredictable market. Those interested in the opportunity to make profits from tokens with potential should consider purchasing this digital asset. Mind-blowing Tokenomics Revealed Neo Pepe’s tokenomics have been designed to push community engagement, sustain the token’s growth, and increase investor confidence in the project. Its presale is structured across 16 phases, offering investors the opportunity to enter from a price of $0.05 to $0.16, with the developers targeting a total fundraising of $50 million. Step Action Quick Guide 1 Wallet Setup Get ERC-20 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) 2 Fund Wallet Add ETH, USDT, or USDC from an exchange 3 Connect to Presale Go to NeoPepe.ai and connect 4 Purchase Tokens Swap ETH/USDT/USDC for $NEOP tokens 5 Confirm Transaction Verify details and approve transaction 6 Secure Storage Store tokens securely in your wallet After its launch, $NEOP will unlock hourly, ensuring immediate circulation and avoiding price volatility, a feature that is expected to attract investors. In addition, every transaction is expected to add 2.5% to the liquidity, ensuring that a portion of its LP tokens are burnt to stabilize the price of the token and boost investor assurance. Neo Pepe has also adopted a community governance model, allowing holders to vote on several aspects concerning the project, including which exchanges should list $NEOP next, showing that the platfhe platform is decentralized. Unbeatable Market Advantage Neo Pepe has outperformed most presales, including Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) and Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL). Unlike Bitcoin Pepe’s focus on only the meme narrative, Neo Pepe is mixing that meme coin narrative with a move towards decentralization and financial freedom. In comparison to Bitcoin Bull, Neo Pepe’s hourly unlock and transparent liquidity protocol ensures the price of the token is stable. Such developments make Neo Pepe a promising investment and a standard for projects looking to launch tokens in the future. Furthermore, Neo Pepe also had a better advantage than established projects like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) due to its governance and liquidity moves. While Ethereum has been dominating most networks in the crypto market, its high transaction fees remain an issue. Also, the liquidity process and low entry of Neo Pepe allow investors to take advantage of its present price. BNB’s reliance on centralized exchanges puts it a little bit below Neo Pepe, which focuses on its community governance, allowing investors to make decisions. Swift Entry to Neo Pepe Entering the project at this early stage requires a straightforward process: You need to set up a wallet compatible with ERC-20 tokens like MetaMask. You will need to deposit funds in USDT, USDC, or ETH. Connect your wallet using the Neo Pepe presale platform. Swap your choice of crypto for $NEOP Confirm the transaction details and keep your tokens secure. Each step is easy, allowing even new investors to participate in the presale. In addition, the platform also has guides and resources to support new users readily available, showing its commitment to stress-free investments. Ironclad Value Proposition Neo Pepe is positioning itself as one of the best crypto investments in the crypto market. It is taking advantage of the power of decentralization, its tokenomics, and community governance. Its platform is also designed to eliminate traditional financial challenges, making it the best choice in the crypto industry. Investors need tokens that are not just built on hype but are also designed to adapt to the market conditions. Neo Pepe solves this problem, using the best mechanisms to protect investor wealth while helping its token grow. Traders that invest in this project will not just be getting immediate rewards but also strong long-term profits. Unveiling Crypto’s Next Big Shift Neo Pepe’s launch is expected to set the stage for how crypto investment opportunities are created in the industry, setting the standards for transparency, liquidity, and community engagement. Investors might be moving towards projects that provide clear values while helping their community. Such a move could push existing and new projects to adopt similar structures, changing the standards investors use when seeking out new assets. As the market continues to develop, Neo Pepe represents the shift investors have been looking for. Its launch is expected to be a turning point in crypto investments, pushing investors to rethink their investment strategies. For investors looking to explore the platform and engage directly with Neo Pepe’s community, materials are available to provide insights into the next steps. Participation in this best new crypto presale could also help your portfolio, ensuring you enjoy developments in the crypto market.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-09 15:34:49

The move will see President Trump’s backed entities make deeper inroads into the crypto asset markets. Institutional investors increase their appetite for crypto products, leading to a new cycle as prices flash new highs. Trump Media Readies Huge Purchase According to sources familiar with the matter, Trump Media Group, the firm behind Truth Social, plans a $3 billion raise to buy multiple crypto assets. The Financial Times reported that the company seeks to raise $2 billion in equity and $1 billion in a convertible bond sale . If the deal goes through, Trump-related companies will extend their foray into digital assets to the delight of most crypto users. President Trump’s backing has fueled institutional and retail sentiments since the start of his second term in the White House. In January, Trump Media announced plans to roll out a fintech arm as part of a crypto-linked diversification process. At the time, the firm sought to purchase $250 million of digital assets and subsequently struck a deal with Crypto.com. Since his inauguration, the President has spurred innovation with crypto-friendly policies like forming a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a crypto task force. World Liberty Financial (WLF), another Trump family entity, has recently struck global partnerships. The company partnered with the Pakistan Crypto Council to boost digital asset adoption and accelerate Bitcoin innovation. “The WLF … has signed a landmark Letter of Intent with the PCC to accelerate blockchain innovation, stablecoin adoption and decentralised finance integration across Pakistan,” the statement read. This month, USD1, WLF stablecoin facilitated MGX, Abu Dhabi’s investment firm $2 billion venture into Binance. The move sparked diverse reactions with industry experts projecting more institutional backing for the stablecoin while Democratic lawmakers called for investigations into Trump’s crypto dealings. Recall that Trump launched a meme coin before his inauguration and promised to make the United States the world’s Bitcoin capital. Institutional Investors Are Not Slowing Down Large-scale holders pushed Bitcoin price to an all-time high above $111k and are not showing fear signals. Michael Saylor’s Strategy bagged an additional 4,020 BTC, taking total holdings to 580,250 bought at an average price of $69,979. Chinese textile firm Addentax also earmarked $800 million to scoop crypto assets.

Messari analysis concludes Cardano ended Q1 2025 with a $1.1 billion treasury as well as increasing governance participation, reflecting its financial strength as well as active community. Solana is featured after CryptoSlate reports renewed ETF filings as well as the revival of capital flows from DeFi, demonstrating institution interest remains elevated even in recent tumult. Investor discussion has been all about the on-chain strength of Cardano as well as the technical strength of Solana. Meanwhile, a new DeFi project has popped up and is now making waves with its cross-border payment use case. Experts are extremely bullish about the same and placing their bets on it. Why the Bulls Are Targeting New Highs For Cardano Cardano has traded at approximately $0.6775 today, holding modest daily gains of 1.51% against yesterday’s close. Its month-to-date is in the red at 12.86%, showing broader altcoin pressure even as BTC hovers in the $106,000 zone. On-chain whale buying has exploded, with $126 million in new acquisitions filled with hope ADA will recover its own 2024 highs. Looking ahead, analysts have Cardano closing in 2025 at above $1.56 if the upgrades to the network result in better smart contract efficiency and staking rewards remain stable. Analysts such as Khubab on X (formerly Twitter) have predicted upside targets for ADA at $1.0463, $1.2145, and $1.3984. Khubab also identifies the support area at $0.58–$0.61. Solana Price Climbs Higher: Will SOL Hit $200? Solana price is at $154.05, with the coin registering a 2.02% gain in the previous 24 hours as market players translate the macro signals. Nonetheless, Solana price has lost 23.0% since the beginning of January, further testifying to the bumpy beginning to the year 2025 the “Ethereum killer” has experienced. Nonetheless, the recent CryptoTicker report advises the breakout from above $165 can drive Solana price to the $200 threshold, which technical factors will be certain to strengthen. Longer-term forecasts are also positive. Analysts such as Kisama of X (formerly Twitter) have recently forecast that solana price will retake the $185 level once again and will overshoot in the $190-$200 range. With ongoing network upgrades that are optimizing throughput rates and reducing fees, some predictors even envision SOL hitting the $210 level in the latter half of the year. Remittix: The $0.0781 Presale Disruptor Remittix is an ultra-low-fee protocol designed especially for scalable DeFi primitives. It integrates the proof-of-stake chain with cross-chain bridges to facilitate rapid swaps, yield vaults, and NFT marketplaces within one unified ecosystem. The recent release of the Remittix wallet provided frictionless UX with native gas optimization capable of transforming mobile crypto experience. Remittix has sold over 542 million tokens and raised over $15.5 million in capital since it began presale. The growth is reflective of high demand from earliest supporters to get in early ahead of the mainnet launch in Q3. With the 50% bonus, the project is closer to reaching its soft-cap goal of $18 million, which should be attained before the end of wallet whitelisting. Investor statistics reflect the momentum: presale volumes have reached $1.2 million per day, with the number of distinct contributors now standing at over 8,200, implying large-scale participation beyond whales. The 542 million tokens sold to date already represent 26.45% of the 2 billion-token supply, which indicates tight shortage in anticipation of release. On-chain presale statistics further show the repeated buying rate standing at 70%, which suggests robust conviction in the token’s use case. Relative to Solana and Cardano, Remittix is distinguished in laser-focused attention to payment velocity and UX ease. Although SOL and ADA have established ecosystems, the tokenomics-focused, community-presale strategy of Remittix grants an even tighter, less complicated on-ramp to the mass market buyer. The fusion of staking rewards, cross-blockchain liquidity, and gateway NFT positions RTX to surpass its rivals in tech nimbleness as well as grassroots-level adoption.

Macroeconomic shifts, like those influencing the EUR/JPY forecast , can impact overall market liquidity and investor sentiment. Recently, Bank of America (BofA) shared its perspective, maintaining a positive outlook on the EUR/JPY currency pair. This stance is particularly interesting given the broader discussions around potential USD weakness . Let’s dive into the details of BofA’s position and what it could mean for the markets. Why BofA Remains Bullish on EUR/JPY? Exploring BofA Forex Analysis Bank of America’s positive view on EUR/JPY isn’t arbitrary. It stems from a careful Forex analysis that considers multiple factors. At the core of their thesis are the diverging monetary policy paths of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan (BoJ), coupled with relative economic outlooks. Monetary Policy Divergence: The ECB has been in a tightening cycle, albeit potentially nearing its end, while the BoJ has maintained an ultra-loose monetary policy. This significant difference in interest rates makes the Euro attractive for ‘carry trade’ strategies, where investors borrow in a low-interest currency (like JPY) and invest in a higher-interest currency (like EUR). Economic Outlooks: While both regions face challenges, the Eurozone economy has shown resilience, whereas Japan’s economy continues to grapple with deflationary pressures and structural issues. Relative economic performance can influence currency strength. Inflation Trends: Persistent inflation in the Eurozone contrasts with subdued inflation in Japan, reinforcing the need for different policy responses from their respective central banks. This fundamental divergence provides a strong foundation for BofA’s expectation that the Euro will likely appreciate against the Yen over time. The Shadow of USD Weakness: How it Impacts EUR/JPY A significant part of BofA’s narrative involves the potential for USD weakness . The US Dollar’s role as the world’s primary reserve currency means its strength or weakness has ripple effects across the entire Forex market, including the EUR/JPY pair. Here’s how potential USD weakness plays into the EUR/JPY outlook: Inverse Correlation: Often, the Euro and other major currencies tend to strengthen when the US Dollar weakens. If investors move away from the safety of the Dollar, they might seek alternatives, potentially benefiting the Euro. Global Risk Sentiment: A weakening Dollar can sometimes coincide with improving global risk sentiment. In such an environment, ‘risk-on’ currencies or those benefiting from carry trades (like EUR/JPY) might perform well, while traditional safe havens (like USD and sometimes JPY) could underperform. Capital Flows: Shifts in global capital flows away from USD-denominated assets can lead to increased demand for other currencies, influencing pairs like EUR/JPY. While EUR/JPY doesn’t directly trade against the USD, the broader market dynamics influenced by USD movements are critical context for BofA’s bullish stance. Navigating the Market: What BofA Forex Analysis Suggests for Currency Trading For individuals involved in currency trading , BofA’s analysis provides a potential directional bias. However, it’s important to remember that bank forecasts are just one piece of the puzzle. Traders should integrate such analysis with their own research, technical indicators, and risk management strategies. Key takeaways for currency trading based on this view: Potential Opportunities: Considering long positions in EUR/JPY, aligning with BofA’s forecast. Looking for entry points on pullbacks, assuming the broader trend remains bullish. Exploring potential relative value trades involving EUR, JPY, and USD, where the BofA view suggests certain pairs might outperform others. Potential Challenges and Risks: Unexpected shifts in central bank policy (e.g., BoJ tightening, ECB pausing/cutting sooner than expected). Changes in global risk sentiment (e.g., a flight back to safety boosting USD and JPY). Geopolitical events that could disrupt market trends. Economic data surprises from the Eurozone, Japan, or the US. Trading based on any forecast requires careful consideration of these risks and the implementation of stop-loss orders to protect capital. Putting it Together: The Interplay of Factors in the EUR/JPY Forecast The bullish EUR/JPY forecast from BofA is a synthesis of several interconnected factors. It’s not just about the Euro or the Yen in isolation, but how their relative strengths and weaknesses play out against each other, influenced by global macro trends and the significant backdrop of potential USD weakness . Consider the following points: Interest rate differentials remain a primary driver, favoring EUR over JPY. Economic resilience (or lack thereof) in the respective regions supports the policy divergence. Global market sentiment, often tied to USD dynamics, can amplify or dampen carry trade appeal. Technical chart patterns might also align with the fundamental outlook, providing confirmation for traders. Understanding this interplay is key to appreciating the nuances of BofA’s Forex analysis and its implications for your own currency trading activities. Conclusion: What BofA’s EUR/JPY Stance Means for the Market Bank of America’s decision to remain long EUR/JPY signals confidence in the continuation of trends driven by monetary policy divergence and potential shifts in global currency dynamics, particularly related to USD weakness . Their BofA Forex team’s analysis provides a valuable perspective for market participants. While this outlook suggests potential upside for EUR/JPY, the Forex market is inherently volatile. Traders and investors should use this information as part of a broader research process, always prioritizing risk management. Whether you’re directly involved in currency trading or monitoring Forex trends for their impact on other asset classes like crypto, keeping an eye on major bank forecasts and the underlying macro drivers is essential for informed decision-making.

A security company, allegedly owned by two of the charged suspects (a couple), used an armored transport service to smuggle cash around the country as it laundered millions of dollars of criminal proceeds. Investigators following the money trail allegedly identified a sophisticated money laundering operation run through the armored transport unit of a security company that transferred $190M cash into crypto. Investigations into the source of the $190M converted into crypto by the security company remain ongoing. Bries says the four used money laundering to legitimize their profits Investigators said that the money laundering operation was allegedly run through the armoured transport of a security company that converted $190 million in cash into cryptocurrency. — (Bluey Fan Account) K9 News (@SausageAnchor) June 9, 2025 Queensland Police Service Crime and Intelligence Command, Detective Acting Superintendent David Briese said the four were part of a criminal network that used money laundering to legitimize their profits and exploit legitimate businesses, harming communities and economies. He added that their actions fueled serious organized crime, enabling everything from drug trafficking and exploitation to fraud and violence. A 32-year-old Brisbane man from Heathwood was allegedly a major client of the money laundering operation and washed $9.5 million in 15 months. He was charged on Thursday (5 June) with money laundering and failing to provide the password to a mobile phone. He was remanded in custody and is scheduled to face Brisbane Magistrates’ Court today (9 June). A Gold Coast man, 48, and a woman, 35, who were the security business’s director and general manager, respectively, were each charged on Friday (6 June) with a money laundering offense. The couple, from Maudsland, was granted watchhouse bail and are scheduled to face Southport Magistrates Court on 21 July 2025. Another 58-year-old Brisbane man from West End allegedly funneled money through a business account to a separate business account controlled by the Heathwood man. He was also charged on Friday with two money laundering offenses. He was granted watchhouse bail and is scheduled to face Brisbane Magistrates Court on 1 August 2025. Australian taskforce executes 14 targeted raids across Brisbane and the Gold Coast Over 70 members from the Queensland Joint Organised Crime Taskforce (QJOCTF) executed 14 search warrants at homes and businesses across Brisbane and the Gold Coast between the 5th and 6th of June 2025. The QJOCTF comprised the AFP, Queensland Police Service, Australian Border Force, the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, AUSTRAC, and the Australian Taxation Office. AUSTRAC and the ATO also provided analytical expertise and support during the investigation, which was centered on Southeast Queensland, and monitored cash dead-drops in multiple cities around Australia. The AFP-led Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce (CACT) restrained assets across Queensland and NSW that were suspected of being the proceeds of crime. All confiscated assets had a combined value of about $21 million, including 17 properties, bank accounts, and vehicles. Detective Acting Superintendent Briese from the Drug and Serious Crime Group said this case demonstrated the complexity of money laundering operations and the extreme lengths criminals were willing to go to conceal their illicit gains. “Money laundering investigations are incredibly challenging due to the complex web of deception used by criminals, and this crime cannot be tackled by one agency alone.” – Adrian Telfer , AFP Detective Superintendent Telfer pointed out that the plot was elaborate and calculated, demonstrating the lengths criminals were willing to go to make money. However, he added that the result of the raid was a testament to the great work to protect the public from the harm of serious and organized crime done by the investigators, forensic accountants in the QJOCTF, the CACT, and the Taskforce Avarus partners. ABF Acting Commander Troy Sokoloff praised the efforts of ABF officers working alongside partner agencies in the QJOCTF. He added that the outcome sent a strong message to those who sought to engage in criminal money laundering. AUSTRAC National Coordinator, Law Enforcement, Markus Erikson, also said AUSTRAC intelligence was critical in stopping these crimes. He claimed that the intelligence AUSTRAC provided to law enforcement “painted a vivid trail” of criminal activity being undertaken by different individuals.

ChatGPT Weighs In,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-this-new-cryptocurrency-the-best-ethereum-eth-alternative-to-buy-in-2025-chatgpt-weighs-in/,"In 2025, as major players like Ethereum (ETH) continue to dominate headlines with strong institutional backing and ETF-driven growth, smart investors are looking beyond the obvious, scanning the horizon for the next big cryptocurrency that could deliver exponential returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new cryptocurrency currently trading under $1, is fast emerging as a serious coin. The official presale of Mutuum Finance has priced the token at $0.03 in Phase 5, closer to a Phase 6 price of $0.035 per MUTM. Already having achieved a 200% growth from when it was first launched in presale, Mutuum Finance will officially go live at $0.06, giving current customers a minimum 100% return on investment (2x ROI). With a DeFi-first ecosystem, ultra-low entry price, and a projected 44x ROI, many now consider it one of the best crypto coins to buy before the next market leg up. While ETH remains a powerhouse among the top cryptocurrencies, the shift in trader sentiment suggests the biggest gains in 2025 might come from newer, more agile tokens like MUTM. Presale Picks Up Speed: Mutuum Finance Takes the Lead Mutuum Finance continues to gather momentum as Phase 4 of its presale has sold out ahead of schedule. In Phase 5 currently, tokens are set at $0.03, giving investors a 16.67% return right off the bat once the price increases in the next round. The presale has already raised over $10.2 million and attracted more than 11,700 investors. With demand on the rise and sound fundamentals, most are hoping for even greater returns after launch, as MUTM makes a case for itself as among the top altcoins to invest in 2025. Stablecoin Launch & Certik Audit Build Investor Trust Mutuum Finance is releasing a dollar-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum. Compared to unbacked algorithmic stablecoins, Mutuum’s stablecoin is properly collateralized, so it maintains a constant price and user trust. The smart contracts of the platform have been extensively audited by Certik. This finished audit further strengthens the platform’s preference for transparency, security, and long-term sustainability. Mutuum Finance Buy-and-Distribute Strategy Mutuum Finance sets itself apart with a buy-and-distribute mechanism that regularly buys MUTM tokens in the open market and rewards stakers with them. This reduces the number of tokens in circulation while encouraging long-term investing in the protocol. Early Investors Reward With greater growth Mutuum Finance doesn’t forget its early supporters and continues rewarding them. 10 will be chosen to share a $100,000 giveaway each getting $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens for cheering the project in the beginning. The Buy-and-Distribute system, robust security of its coin and recognized audit credentials all make Mutuum Finance an interesting combination of progress, proven safety and active community involvement. For bold investors, it allows them to support a DeFi project as it is starting out in the field. Mutuum Finance’s presale success, having raised over $10.2 million from more than 11,700 investors and already delivering a 200% growth since launch, highlights its strong market potential. With tokens currently priced at $0.03 in Phase 5 and set to go live at $0.06, early buyers are positioned to double their investment, while projections indicate a possible 44x return on investment in the near future.

He’s put about 80% of his net worth into BTC at an average price below $25,000. Rather than fret over today’s high sticker, he says the odds favor more gains ahead than losses. Related Reading: Blank Pi Network Wallets Spark Outcry—What’s The Network Hiding? Deaton’s Big Bet According to Deaton, buying at six figures isn’t too late. He calls today’s price range “more asymmetrical,” meaning the upside is greater than the downside. He’s put 80% of his wealth into Bitcoin. His average entry cost was less than $25,000. Still, he sees room to run even from around $106,000. Macro Concerns Drive Interest Based on reports, Deaton worries about soaring national debt in the US and fresh tariffs from US President Donald Trump’s time in office. He flags endless money printing by central banks as a red flag. I’m not in favor of telling people living paycheck to paycheck (me until 15 years ago) to take out a mortgage on their primary home to buy Bitcoin (I’m not suggesting that that’s what David is recommending either), but I am in the process of selling real estate, and although my… https://t.co/JMB1zgeazW — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) June 8, 2025 He says all these moves are chipping away at trust in fiat cash. With only 21 million BTC ever to be mined, Bitcoin can’t be inflated away. That fixed supply, he argues, makes it a solid hedge against a shaky dollar. Corporate And State Adoption Institutional demand is also on the rise. MicroStrategy—now called Strategy—holds more than 200,000 BTC, worth tens of billions of dollars. And in the last seven days, 16 companies have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. On the government side, Rep. Tim Burchett introduced a bill to turn a Trump executive order into law, creating a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Countries like Pakistan, Ukraine, and Ireland are weighing similar steps. They want to see if holding Bitcoin could protect their foreign exchange plans. Skeptics Voice Worries Not everyone agrees with Deaton’s rosy outlook. Economist Peter Schiff, a gold advocate, says Bitcoin has no real value and is too wild to be a safe haven. He tweeted that today’s rally is just hype. Deaton doesn’t shy away from such criticism. He admits he has “confirmation and wealth-preservation bias.” He still insists Bitcoin is the best store of value during today’s economic storms. Related Reading: Elon Musk ‘Will Do Anything’ To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Deaton warns against buying with money you can’t afford to lose. He tells people living paycheck-to-paycheck not to risk their homes or take out loans just to buy crypto. His basic message is simple: look past daily price swings and ask where the world’s money is headed. If you share his concerns about the dollar and believe institutions will keep piling in, his bet on Bitcoin could pay off. But anyone on the sidelines should be ready for big swings and should only invest what they can handle.

Ripple ( XRP ) was trading at $2.25 on Monday, June 9, up 9.35% from its monthly low and 40% above the year-to-date low. XRP has two key bullish catalysts that could push its price higher in the long term. First, the odds of the SEC approving a spot XRP ETF have jumped to 87% on Polymarket . This spike is due to increased crypto support from the SEC under Paul Atkins. Approval of an XRP ETF would likely lead to substantial inflows. JPMorgan projects over $8 billion in the first year alone. However, there’s a risk that the market has already priced in the approval, which may come by October. Second, Ripple Labs aims to become a dominant player in cross-border payments through partnerships with banks and other companies. CEO Brad Garlinghouse believes that the end of the SEC lawsuit will help it accelerate partnerships with American companies. The challenge is that Circle has become a major competitor in this business through its Circle Payment Network. CPN connects banks and other companies, letting them send payments that settle in seconds.

The token is consolidating near the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, while the Average True Range has dropped to its lowest point since Nov. 29, indicating declining volatility. The biggest technical risk for XRP is the formation of a descending triangle pattern, with key support at $1.9255.

CRCL jumped to $138.27, a significant increase from its offer price of $31. The rally was driven by investor appetite for exposure to the growing stablecoin industry, which Citi expects it to be worth over $1.6 trillion by 2030. Circle’s performance makes it the best-performing IPO of the year. However, there are two key reasons why the stock may be due for a reversal. Valuation concerns remain Circle’s stock price may face downside pressure due to valuation concerns. Its current market capitalization of $27 billion represents roughly 45% of its total USD Coin ( USDC ) assets, which is relatively high. In its most recent earnings disclosure, Circle posted $1.6 billion in annual revenue for 2024, up from $1.45 billion in 2023. Net income came in at $155 million, giving the stock a price-to-earnings ratio of 174.2, well above industry norms. While Circle may deserve a premium valuation due to its leading position in the stablecoin market, a key risk is the potential for earnings growth to slow. This risk becomes more pronounced if the Federal Reserve begins cutting interest rates later this year and into 2026, as Polymarket traders expect. Circle’s core business earns revenue by investing its reserve assets in government bonds—whose yields are likely to decline as rate cuts begin. You might also like: Circle IPO priced above range at $31 per share ahead of NYSE debut Post IPO momentum to lose steam amid profit-taking Another reason Circle stock could retreat is the potential loss of post-IPO momentum, a common pattern observed with newly listed companies. For example, Coinbase opened at $380 on its IPO day and climbed to $430 shortly after, only to plunge to a record low of $30 in 2023. More recently, Webull stock jumped from $10 to $80 post-IPO and has since dropped to $11. Similarly, Robinhood rose from $35 to $84 after listing, then fell to $6.74 in 2022. Robinhood stock jumped from $35 on its IPO day to $84 on the following day, and then lost momentum, reaching a low of $6.74 in 2022. This performance happens as the post-IPO momentum fades and investors start to take profits. Also, the IPO hype will be followed by the fear of the December lock-up expiry, which will let insiders sell their stock. Historically, stocks drop towards the lock-up period.

Accordingly, technology exchange Nasdaq added four more altcoins to its cryptocurrency index, increasing the total number of assets from 5 to 9. Accordingly, Nasdaq filed Form 8-K with the SEC to add four altcoins, namely XRP, Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Stellar (XLM), to its crypto index. If Nasdaq’s application to the SEC for NCIUSS, which is a reference index, is accepted, XRP, SOL, XLM and ADA will be added to the fund, excluding Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Chainlink (LINK), Litecoin (LTC) and Uniswap (UNI). Hashdex’s ETF, which trades under the ticker NCIQ, also tracks this index and only offers investment in BTC and ETH due to regulations in the US, as restrictions imposed by the SEC prevent the ETF from holding digital assets other than BTC and ETH. However, if the SEC approves the application, Hasdex's NCIQ ETF will also be able to invest in all nine cryptocurrencies in the index. The SEC's final decision deadline is November 2, 2025, and a decision must be made by that date. *This is not investment advice.

After a successful Initial Public Offering (IPO), the company’s stock has soared in value. The announcement of two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) linked directly to CRCL shares adds more excitement. These changes mark a new beginning for Circle and show that it’s becoming more critical in modern financial technology and traditional investing. Circle’s ETFs Scheduled to Launch in August The ProShares Ultra CRCL ETF is designed to deliver twice the daily return of CRCL stock. As a leveraged ETF, it can amplify both gains and losses. However, it is intended for short-term use and requires daily management. This is because holding it over longer periods may lead to unpredictable results. The Bitwise CRCL Income ETF will employ a covered call strategy to generate income. This strategy is set to offer investors potential income while still being tied to the performance of Circle stock. Both ETFs are expected to go live on August 20, 2025, pending U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval. This is the first time in ETF history that such funds are directly tied to a crypto-fintech company like Circle. It shows that traditional finance is beginning to embrace the digital asset sector in new ways. The ETFs are expected to give investors more choices, and long-term investors can have another way to gain exposure to Circle’s stock. Investors looking for option income or leveraged short-term gains are now seeing a broader set of opportunities. This is especially because the USDC stablecoin issuer is now listed on New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Circle IPO Success Sparks Investor Interest Circle’s first day on the stock market was a big success. The stock price jumped 17% to $126.24, showing that many people believe in the company’s future. Big investors, like Ark Investment, quickly bought Circle shares. Ark bought $373 million worth of CRCL stock , which made the stock even more popular and helped increase its price. This shows that big players trust Circle’s new financial products. Meanwhile, digital investment company Arca recently gave up all its Circle shares . This came after the firm revealed it would no longer accept USDC as it closed all of its accounts with Circle. Circle Stock ETF Could Face Regulatory Roadblocks Remain While the ETF news has driven the stock higher, approval from the SEC is not guaranteed. Also, US macroeconomics reports from the Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI) could affect the market and investors’ sentiment. If the ETF is not approved soon or the market conditions change, the Circle’s stock price could stop rising.

Despite recent dips, DOGE still holds a solid 27% gain year-on-year, and growing chatter around whale accumulation could signal the start of a bigger move. Such price action emerges as self-proclaimed Dogecoin Millionaire Glauber Contessoto has recently been branching into other meme tokens, including PEPE, BRETT and WIF. But while this might seem like he has abandoned DOGE, Contessoto is still holding onto the meme token, indicating that he believes it has a very positive long-term price prediction . Dogecoin Price Prediction: ‘DOGE Millionaire’ Doubles Down on Memes – Which Coin is He Buying Now? Contessoto actually invested in PEPE back in February, ditching his Ethereum holdings and putting $1 million into the frog-themed meme token. $PEPE is at a $6 Billion dollar mcap 3 months after I posted this… Is it too early to revisit this tweet? My $PEPE is currently worth $1.5 Million https://t.co/y02LBflUw3 — SlumDOGE Millionaire (@ProTheDoge) May 12, 2025 The Doge Millionaire has also opened positions in BRETT and WIF in recent weeks, with the trader posting a couple of weeks ago that he switched from TOSHI to BRETT . But as mentioned above, he continues to hold just over 5 million DOGE , or about $925,000 at today’s prices. This stands as a big vote of confidence in the long-running meme token, which despite underwhelming in the first half of 2025 may have the potential to have a stronger second half of the year. And if we look at its chart today, we see that it’s potentially in a very bullish position, with its indicators bottoming out recently. Source: TradingView Its RSI (purple), for example, touched 30 a few days ago and now appears to have begun a climb upwards. At the same time, DOGE’s 30-day average (orange) is about to bottom out in relation to the 200-day (blue), another signal that we could be in for an upwards correction. But we may have to wait for the Dogecoin price to fall a little further before it has a sustained recovery, given that some whales have been sending the coin to exchanges in the past week . After that, it should return to $0.20 by the end of June, and $0.50+ by August. New Meme Tokens with Strong Fundamentals If DOGE still seems a little too uncertain for some traders, they may prefer to investigate newer meme tokens, with several new examples boasting interesting fundamentals. New ERC-20 token Bitcoin Bull (BULL) is capturing serious attention as it combines meme coin energy with real Bitcoin utility — including BTC airdrops for holders. With nearly $7 million raised and just 20 days left in its presale, investors are rushing to secure their bags before the next price increase. Hold tight, bulls. When Bitcoin hits $150K, BTCBULL airdrop goes live. Step by step. Candle by candle. pic.twitter.com/d9ctOBDSDn — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) June 4, 2025 What sets BTCBULL apart is its unique tokenomics: Bitcoin airdrops are distributed to $BTCBULL holders each time BTC hits a $50K milestone, starting at $150,000 . A token burn is triggered for every $25K BTC rise — beginning with a major burn at $125,000 — slashing supply and boosting scarcity. This dual reward structure not only incentivizes holding but also positions BTCBULL as one of the most explosive presale opportunities of the year. Built on Ethereum with a total supply of 21 billion tokens, BTCBULL is also fully stakeable , offering dynamic APYs during and after the presale. To join the sale before it’s too late, you need simply go to the Bitcoin Bull website and connect a wallet, such as Best Wallet . BTCBULL is available at $0.002555, a price which could end up seeming very cheap when the token goes live.

In premarket trading, Robinhood’s stock slid by almost 5%, as reported by CNBC . It had jumped 3.3% on Friday, pushing last week’s gain to more than 13%, before S&P Dow Jones Indices announced after the close that the S&P 500 lineup would remain the same. At the same time, other major stocks dropped, including the electric vehicle maker Tesla, which suffered a 2% dip. Baird had moved Tesla’s stock from ‘buy’ to ‘neutral’ on their preference list because Musk’s robotaxi plans were “a bit too optimistic.” The “considerable uncertainty” about Elon Musk’s relationship with Trump makes things worse. Robinhood was a major contender to join the S&P 500 according to BoA The quarterly rebalance, which normally takes place on the third Friday of the final month in each quarter, often drives billions of dollars of trading. Passive funds tied to the index typically buy large volumes of any company added in the days that follow. A recent winner from this process was crypto exchange Coinbase, whose shares leaped 24% in the session after its inclusion was revealed last month. Still, Robinhood has enjoyed a strong comeback this year. Its share price has roughly doubled, and it hit a fresh record high last week amid renewed strength in both stocks and cryptocurrencies. The firm had lost favor after the GameStop trading frenzy of 2021 faded and the collapse of FTX sparked a drop in digital assets. Meanwhile, Robinhood Markets, Inc. completed its acquisition of Bitstamp on May 2, 2025, finalizing a deal first announced in June 2024. The $200 million transaction was paid entirely in cash. Bitstamp, based in Luxembourg, is one of the oldest and most respected cryptocurrency exchanges, with a broad international reach and a loyal client base. Robinhood says the purchase marks a key step in its plan to broaden its presence in the global crypto market. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

In fact, Bitcoin funding rates remain low, which is indicative of a continued caution as the world’s leading crypto asset trades around the $107K mark. Bitcoin Traders Remain Cautious There’s a growing disconnect between public market enthusiasm for crypto equities and the underlying digital asset market. Circle’s IPO, which pushed its valuation to $24 billion – nearly $20 billion higher than Coinbase’s prior offer – has renewed Wall Street’s appetite for crypto-related stocks. However, Bitcoin’s muted funding rate, which has even turned negative, suggests that crypto traders remain cautious. According to Matrixport’s latest report , some investors may be betting on crypto stocks while shorting Bitcoin to hedge exposure. Despite the renewed institutional interest in equity markets, this optimism has yet to translate into a significant uptick in demand or price momentum within the broader crypto asset space. Signs Of Fatigue QCP Capital also pointed to the growing signs of stagnation in the Bitcoin market as implied volatility continues to decline ahead of summer. Implied vols are now at one-year lows and appear relatively cheap, yet realized volatility is even lower, which indicates a lack of price movement. Past data indicates that front-end volatility typically continues to decline as the market moves deeper into July. A similar pattern occurred last year, when 1-month at-the-money vols fell sharply from 80% in March to 40% by July, as Bitcoin repeatedly failed to break past the $70,000 resistance level. This year, QCP noted that no immediate macro catalyst is present to push Bitcoin meaningfully above $110,000 or below $100,000 levels, which it believes would be necessary to reignite market interest. While US equities rallied and gold dipped following a stronger-than-expected jobs report, Bitcoin remained largely unresponsive. As such, “signs of fatigue” are evident, with perpetual open interest weakening and spot Bitcoin ETF inflows beginning to slow. Options market activity mirrors this indecision, as traders roll their bullish positions from July to September in significant size, indicating a delay in expectations for any major upside move.

Bitcoin remains strong, and AI-driven tokens are experiencing explosive interest. Yet, in the midst of all this movement, traders and analysts alike are looking beyond the usual suspects. The excitement is now centered on the most popular cryptocurrency taking over the spotlight— Qubetics . As legacy coins lose momentum, the demand for more advanced, user-driven solutions is growing fast. Qubetics answers that call, building an ecosystem that merges real-world usability with cutting-edge blockchain features. With its focus on interoperability, decentralization, and smart financial tools, Qubetics is becoming the most popular cryptocurrency among serious participants and developers alike. The same market that once saw Bitcoin Cash rise now sees its successor. In 2025, Qubetics is being widely recognized as the most popular cryptocurrency redefining the future of digital finance—picking up where older projects fell short. When Bitcoin Cash Ruled—and Why That Chapter Is Over Bitcoin Cash (BCH) once promised a faster, cheaper alternative to Bitcoin. With its increased block size and transactional efficiency, it gained early momentum. During the 2021 bull market, BCH touched a peak of $1,636, and it’s listing on major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance drew immense public attention. Yet, with limited innovation and internal conflicts among developers, the momentum slowly faded. While Bitcoin Cash did serve as an experimental evolution of Bitcoin’s original intent, it fell short of supporting mainstream adoption. Its utility did not extend beyond payment facilitation, and that narrowed its growth potential. As networks like Ethereum, Solana, and newer Layer-1 chains integrated smart contracts, dApps, and DeFi protocols, BCH stood idle. That stagnation created a vacuum—a demand for smarter, broader blockchain solutions. Today, BCH struggles to stay relevant even as general crypto market activity surges again. Analysts point out that projects without progressive roadmaps, dynamic tokenomics, or utility in real-world scenarios tend to fall behind. Bitcoin Cash, despite its history, now reflects a missed opportunity for those seeking sustainable long-term growth in the digital finance sector. Qubetics: The Most Popular Cryptocurrency Entering Its Final Presale Phase Qubetics is now at the center of attention in blockchain circles. Already recognized as the most popular cryptocurrency in its class, Qubetics has managed to capture more than just market share—it has captured belief. Built around a next-gen Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, it goes beyond typical token utility to enable financial autonomy across chains, regions, and sectors. From freelancers needing stable cross-border payments, to retailers integrating decentralized checkout systems, Qubetics delivers a new digital economy framework: The Qubetics wallet enables secure storage and instant transfers across multiple chains—without middlemen. Business owners can bypass transaction bottlenecks using real-time DeFi liquidity protocols. Professionals—from attorneys to consultants—gain easy invoicing tools integrated with decentralized smart contracts. With over 515 million tokens sold to 27,700+ holders, and $17.8 million already raised in crypto presale , Qubetics’ numbers speak for themselves. At $0.3370 per $TICS token, only 10 million tokens remain in the 37th and final stage. Following a strategic supply cut from 4 billion to just 1.36 billion tokens, scarcity is being engineered to fuel post-launch momentum. This scarcity narrative is not manufactured—it’s encoded. With 38.55% of tokens going to public allocation and a listing price set at $0.40, the projected 20% immediate ROI is just the beginning. Analysts are forecasting a surge toward $10–$15 post-mainnet due to strong fundamentals, real-world utility, and community-first tokenomics. Qubetics has not simply created a cryptocurrency. It has structured a tokenomics system that prioritizes long-term value over hype cycles. While most altcoins promise scarcity without action, Qubetics has followed through by reducing its total supply by more than 66%. That alone shifts the dynamics of its token economy, but it’s the redistribution of power to the community that sets it apart. A full 38.55% of the supply is now publicly allocated, eliminating centralized whales and ensuring wider participation. Combined with a deflationary structure and strategic burns, the ecosystem becomes not only sustainable—but dynamic. The most popular cryptocurrency is rarely just about utility; it’s about how power is distributed, and Qubetics ensures that it stays with the user base. Furthermore, the built-in staking model incentivizes long-term holding and ecosystem involvement. With passive earning opportunities coded into the architecture, participants find more than just potential value—they gain practical benefits. Crypto analysts and market strategists are unanimous in their forecasts: $TICS is headed for a strong market debut. With increasing scarcity, growing demand, and the final presale ticking down, the setup is in place for a substantial price acceleration. This isn’t a pump—it’s protocol-level precision. Conclusion: Bitcoin Cash Was Yesterday. Qubetics Is What Comes Next The lesson of Bitcoin Cash is clear: even the most hyped projects can fall behind if they fail to grow. In contrast, Qubetics is actively building, integrating, and delivering. From its multi-chain wallet to smart DeFi protocols, it’s not just another token—it’s an entire infrastructure. That’s why many now see it as the most popular cryptocurrency with real long-term potential. What Bitcoin Cash hinted at, Qubetics is now achieving. With strong tokenomics, utility-first development, and growing community adoption, it’s cementing its role as the most popular cryptocurrency in this new market cycle. Unlike many hype-based coins, Qubetics is about sustained value—and users are paying attention. The story of missed opportunities doesn’t have to repeat. Qubetics stands ready as the most popular cryptocurrency of 2025, bridging the gap between promise and performance. The choice now is clear: look back, or move forward.

Market sentiment improved sharply, with the Fear and Greed Index rising from 46 on June 6 to 55 by June 10, its highest in early June. Over the same period, total crypto market capitalisation jumped 5.8%, climbing from $3.28 trillion to $3.47 trillion as capital flowed back into digital assets. Altcoin markets had also flipped positive at the time of writing, with gains seen across nearly all of the top 99 cryptocurrencies. Why is Bitcoin going up? Bitcoin’s latest rally comes amid renewed optimism over the outcome of high-stakes trade talks between the United States and China. As officials from both sides meet in London today, markets are hoping for signs of easing tensions in the long-running tariff standoff. The talks, led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, are expected to focus on key tariff barriers that have weighed on global trade. Traders are closely watching for any post-meeting statements from President Donald Trump, who last week signalled confidence, saying, “The meeting should go very well.” A meaningful breakthrough could help stabilise risk sentiment, with Bitcoin increasingly viewed as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty. For many, the success of Circle’s listing is a broader vote of confidence in the digital asset industry. Beyond geopolitics, institutional tailwinds are also fuelling the recovery. Circle, the issuer of USDC, officially began trading on the New York Stock Exchange last week and saw overwhelming demand that forced underwriters to upsize the offering by one-third.. The long-awaited public debut is being seen as a vote of confidence in digital asset infrastructure, boosting investor sentiment around crypto’s integration with traditional finance. In another key development, The Blockchain Group, a Paris-based firm positioning itself as Europe’s first Bitcoin treasury company, announced plans to raise over $340 million to expand its BTC holdings, just one week after purchasing $68 million worth of Bitcoin. Together, these catalysts have helped Bitcoin regain momentum after last week’s decline. If macro conditions continue to stabilise, analysts say BTC could soon test resistance levels last seen before the recent slump. What’s next for Bitcoin? Bitcoin managed to push past $106,000 over the weekend and reached as high as $107,000 on Monday, before encountering seller pressure near key resistance. The weekly close brought BTC/USD back near its opening level, effectively marking a full-circle recovery that traders say could carry technical significance. Analyst Rekt Capital noted that Bitcoin had broken its two-week downtrend and identified $106,600 as a key resistance level that needed to be flipped into support.

Bitcoin’s recent performance also marked its fourth consecutive weekly close in the green. Rekt Capital pointed to $104,400 as an important level that held, though a definitive bull market structure still appeared to be developing. Others see signs that Bitcoin may be building strength after its recent dip to $100,000. Trader CryptoKing described Bitcoin’s current structure as the “calm before the storm,” noting that Bitcoin was compressing just below $107,800 in what they called a classic volatility squeeze, with higher lows, fading volume, and a cooling RSI suggesting a breakout could be imminent. BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: CryptoKing/X Market participants are also keeping a close eye on liquidity patterns. Over the past month, Bitcoin’s price has frequently moved sharply in both directions to tap into thick liquidity zones. Daan Crypto Trades said the $100,000 mark now represents the key level to watch on the downside, warning that a break below it could “really accelerate” the correction.

Beyond technicals, macro factors are expected to impact Bitcoin’s trajectory. This week’s release of U.S. inflation data, including the May CPI and PPI prints on June 11–12, will serve as a crucial gauge of market sentiment. Although inflation has been gradually slowing in 2025, Fed officials have remained hesitant to commit to rate cuts. That reluctance has drawn criticism from President Trump and left risk asset traders anxiously watching the central bank’s next move. According to CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, markets are not expecting a cut at the upcoming June or July FOMC meetings. However, the possibility of a 25-basis-point cut in September remains open. Analysts say any signs of softer inflation could revive expectations of looser monetary policy, potentially serving as a tailwind for Bitcoin and other risk assets. According to Swissblock, a private wealth management firm, inflation data due this week could “unleash volatility” across risk markets. In a June 9 post on X, the firm noted that while Bitcoin bulls are “slowly rebuilding structure and regrouping,” a short-term pullback to the $104,000 range remains likely. That cautious outlook was echoed by Mickybull Crypto, who pointed to a head-and-shoulders formation emerging on the daily chart. The analyst projected a possible retracement to $101,500 before any renewed push to fresh highs. Some analysts argue that any short-term downside is unlikely to affect the long-term uptrend. Fellow analyst SuperBro noted that Bitcoin has now held above its highest weekly close from 2021 for four consecutive weeks and hasn’t fallen below the five-week EMA since early May. According to the analyst, these structural signals suggest that “bulls are fully in control,” and once Bitcoin decisively breaks the long-term trendline stretching back to 2021, the next leg higher could take it to the $140,000–$150,000 range.

The relatively flat movement came as the Altcoin Season Index rose to 29, up from 22 just three days ago, signaling a slight weakening in Bitcoin’s dominance. Ethereum (ETH), the largest altcoin by market cap, rose 0.85% over the past day to trade at $2,541 at the time of writing. Other major altcoins like Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and Hyperliquid (HYPE) saw gains ranging from 0.5% to 7%, while XRP (XRP) and Tron (TRX) recorded slight losses of 1.1% and 0.76%, respectively. Kaia (KAIA) led the altcoin rally with nearly 20% gains, followed by Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) and SPX6900 (SPX), which rose 13.7% and 13.3%, respectively.

Meanwhile, SPX6900’s (SPX) gains came after a cryptic post from fiat-to-crypto onramp Moonpay, sparking hype around a possible integration.

According to CNBC’s reporting , OpenAI hit this milestone in less than three years since the initial launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. According to an OpenAI spokesperson cited by CNBC, the ARR figure includes revenue from ChatGPT’s consumer and enterprise offerings, along with API services. The actual revenue figure is likely even larger as reported revenue does not include licensing fees from Microsoft and one-off deals. Profitability challenges remain This revenue growth follows OpenAI’s reported $5.5 billion ARR from 2024, effectively nearly doubling in just a year. However, CNBC notes that the hypergrowth comes at a cost. OpenAI reportedly posted a loss of about $5 billion in the same period, reflecting the capital-intensive nature of AI model development and infrastructure. Regardless, the revenue milestone adds weight to OpenAI’s lofty valuation. The company raised $40 billion in a record-breaking funding round earlier this year and is now valued at roughly 30 times its current revenue. Long-term ambitions OpenAI is also setting its sights even higher, reportedly targeting $125 billion in revenue by 2029, according to CNBC, which cited a person familiar with internal targets.

From hyperinflation-driven adoption in Argentina to innovation hubs in Brazil, the appetite for crypto is accelerating in the region. But that momentum isn’t reflected in media visibility. In Q1 2025, LATAM’s crypto-covering newsrooms showed signs of collapse. According to data from Outset PR , a boutique agency specializing in data-driven organic campaigns for Web3, nearly 73% of 55 active publishers lost traffic between January and March — exposing deep instability in the ecosystem meant to amplify crypto’s narrative. Specifically: Traffic across the analyzed sites dropped from 94.48 million visits in January to 81.53 million in February — a steep 13.71% decline. March brought some recovery, up to 85.59M, but most outlets remained below January levels. The Q1 dip coincided with Bitcoin’s 17% price drop and significant losses in altcoins, driven by exchange hacks, meme coin controversies, and tightening U.S. policy signals, alongside a major Google core update in March. Traffic Gainers Exist — But There’s a Catch Only 15 outlets recorded positive traffic growth during Q1. However, many of these aren’t true crypto-native sources. For example, El Diario and Money Times — both drawing millions of visitors month-over-month — are general finance or news portals that tend to boost crypto coverage only during market highs, leaving gaps when volatility kicks in. They’re also less useful for consistent storytelling or long-term Web3 brand building. Crypto-native growth was rare — but telling. A few dedicated outlets posted strong percentage gains: DiarioBitcoin: +204.31% CriptoTendencia: +98.86% Cripto247: +36.17% Yet their total reach still lagged far behind generalist publications . Even after these surges, the listed outlets operated in the 100,000–400,000 monthly visit range, not in the millions. And the cherry on top? Nearly half of Q1’s gainers averaged fewer than 91,000 monthly visitors. Bitcoin Mexico, Blocknews, and Criptomonedas.eu even sat in the sub-10,000 range, making them suitable for SEO or local targeting — but effectively irrelevant for scalable PR or distribution. The Real Crypto Influence Is in the Hands of a Few Sites — Even as They Decline Notably, the top crypto-focused outlets saw traffic declines in February, and many didn’t recover by March. These included: CriptoNoticias Cointelegraph Brasil Livecoins CriptoFacil BitFinanzas Portal do Bitcoin While their grip on attention is no longer stable, their reach remains unmatched . The report reveals a striking concentration: these six sites were the only publishers to surpass 400,000 average monthly visits in Q1 — together accounting for 69% of total crypto-native traffic. The mid-tier segment, represented by seven outlets including DiarioBitcoin, CriptoTendencia, and Cripto247, captured just 23% of crypto audiences. The remaining 8% was spread across 24 low-traffic sites, which consistently failed to exceed 110,000 monthly visits. Outset PR highlights that this long-tail fragmentation limits the utility of many “full coverage” PR packages — where legacy media lists include outlets that are not just declining, but becoming invisible. A prime example is CryptoNews Brasil, which lost its LATAM visibility entirely — likely due to growing regulatory friction, including domain filtering and stricter rules around betting-related advertising. What Crypto PR Needs in LATAM Now Outset PR’s findings highlight a fundamental shift: media performance is no longer predictable , and past reputation doesn’t guarantee present relevance. To build meaningful traction, crypto brands need to evolve their approach. Here’s what Outset PR recommends. Right moves Wrong moves Diversify across crypto-native outlets with proven stability and/or growth Rely on static media kits or outdated lists — focus on your goals and plan accordingly Mix niche crypto and finance portals for layered visibility during bullish cycles Assume high traffic means high crypto engagement — vet editorial consistency Track Google algorithm updates and local regulatory changes regularly Expect one or two publishers to carry your campaign — scale horizontally across tiers How Outset PR Does It Differently Outset PR doesn’t pitch blind. It audits the media landscape quarter by quarter, using a proprietary system to map reach, relevance, and algorithmic shifts across the markets. Campaigns are built with live performance data Each media outlet is hand-selected based on audience quality, not just quantity Market timing and platform resilience are factored into publishing decisions This data-driven, boutique model ensures that PR is a strategic asset aligned with your roadmap and resources.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) climbed to $108,000, its highest level since May 29, marking a 7.55% gain from its monthly low. Venice Token ( VVV ) rose to $3.52, sharply up from this month’s low of $2.56. Similarly, Kaia ( KAIA ), Ravencoin ( RVN ), Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ), and SPX6900 ( SPX ) jumped by over 10% on Monday. This surge brought the market capitalization of all coins to over $3.35 trillion. The likely catalyst was the easing of trade tensions between the United States and China, with negotiations beginning in London on Monday afternoon. Talks are expected to extend into Tuesday. Markets are hopeful that the two sides will reach an agreement to ease export controls and possibly reduce tariffs. Such an outcome would likely temper investor fears that have lingered for months amid escalating trade restrictions.

BTC and ETH have already seen massive growth, making a 10x rally in 2025 increasingly unlikely without a major macro shift. As a result, traders are now hunting for the next big cryptocurrency coins that offer low entry points and explosive upside. One new crypto catching serious attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , priced at $0.03, and positioned as one of the best cryptos to buy now thanks to its ambitious DeFi utility and early-stage potential. Over $10.2 million has been raised and the project now has 11700 holders. For those wondering what crypto to buy now, the next breakout may come from beyond the top 10. In a market where returns matter more than legacy, the shift toward undervalued altcoins may define the top crypto investments of the year. Why Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) Won’t 10x in 2025 Bitcoin (BTC) is traded at $103,799 and Ethereum (ETH) at about $2,415, both representing mature but consistent market positions. With current valuations, both BTC and ETH have huge mountains to climb in order to provide a 10x move within the year since such methamphetamine-type gains would necessitate out-of-the-box market changes or developments. Bitcoin’s price is showing consolidation above $100,000, which is a more established phase, while Ethereum, despite recent network upgrades, is in a rather constricted trading range. For the high-returning investor, newer altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — under $1 and rooted in DeFi innovation — are becoming the next potential next big cryptocurrency with more explosive potential. Transforming DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending by merging both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows users to lock stablecoins like USDT in liquidity pools backed by smart contracts, receiving passive income while making it easy for borrowers to borrow money easily. Meanwhile, the P2P model eliminates middlemen, allowing lenders and borrowers to directly negotiate with each other. Mutuum Finance stablecoin will launch on the Ethereum blockchain, fully collateralized and USD-pegged. Thanks to the safe, open and Certik-audited nature of this project, blockchain investors enjoy stability. Through the merger of modern finance tech and powerful infrastructure, Mutuum Finance is turning the future of decentralized finance upside down. A DeFi Disruptor Drawing Massive Investor Interest Still in presale, Mutuum Finance has already surpassed more than $10.2 million in funding and has amassed nearly 11,700 investors, making it a solid altcoin ready to experience a major breakthrough. Early Investors Rewarded, Community Continues to Grow With greater growth Mutuum Finance doesn’t forget its early supporters and continues rewarding them. From the investors 10 will be chosen to share a $100,000 giveaway each getting $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens for being part of the project from the beginning. After drawing in funding of over $10.2 million from 11,700 investors, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is growing rapidly and is predicted to be a leading DeFi project priced at only $0.03. Investors entering the round will gain at least a 2x reward as soon as the token is listed on the exchange for $0.06 and the unique lending model and strong Certik auditing provide support for the company’s future success. Since BTC and ETH are no longer growing at the same rate, MUTM is now a choice that investors might find attractive in 2025. Make sure you are part of this presale to catch the next big growth in decentralized finance.

At the time of writing, Ethereum is trying to register a footing above $2,500, but this subdued price action masks what an analyst is calling one of the most critical technical and on-chain moments in Ethereum’s recent history. Ethereum Weekly Engagement Hits Record High According to Crypto Patel, a crypto analyst on the social media platform X, Ethereum’s weekly engagement has reached an all-time high, surpassing all previous peaks seen since 2022. The accompanying chart below shows a steep rise in the number of unique addresses interacting with Ethereum’s ecosystem. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Back In Business? Morningstar Candlestick Pattern Tells A Story According to the most recent data, the number of weekly active addresses stands at 17.4 million, representing an increase of almost 17% in just seven days. Notably, May 2025 saw the most significant growth in engagement, with each of the past three weeks witnessing at least 15 million active addresses. Meanwhile, the Layer 2 multiplier, which reflects adoption across Ethereum’s scaling solutions, has climbed to 7.55x, marking an 18.63% jump over the same period. Crypto Patel described the development as impossible to ignore, adding that the momentum is building fast, and warned followers to stay ready as Ethereum prepares for what could be a dramatic next leg up. “It’s impossible to ignore $ETH right now,” he remarked. Despite a minor 4.31% decline in cross-chain activity in the past seven days, the overall engagement trend confirms that more users are entering the Ethereum ecosystem. Analyst Predicts $9,000 To $10,000 ETH Price Target Complementing this on-chain momentum is a broader technical perspective offered by another crypto analyst known as XForceGlobal on the social media platform X. In a detailed Elliott Wave analysis also shared on X, the analyst noted that Ethereum has successfully completed a complex corrective structure and is now poised to enter a powerful new impulsive phase. According to the chart, the bearish scenario has been invalidated by recent price behavior, and a new bullish cycle is now underway as Ethereum is currently playing out a bullish B wave. Related Reading: Ethereum Price At $8,000: Pundit Predicts Parabolic Run For ETH If this bullish B wave plays out as expected, XForceGlobal projects a major price surge with a target range between $9,000 and $10,000 for Ethereum. Specifically, the analyst identified a $9,410 price target for sometime in the next year. However, the analyst outlines a hypothetical fallback to the $576 zone if the C corrective wave unfolds. Nonetheless, the current wave structure shows an increased likelihood of Ethereum surging higher rather than breaking down. The analyst concluded by stating, “We can now confidently scrap the bearish case. The impulse opened the door for potential new highs.” At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,493 with a recent intraday high of $2,537.

33767162,[object Object],1749490258,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Analyst Reveals 4 Major Reasons Why Buying Dogecoin Now Is A Good Move,https://bitcoinist.com/4-major-reasons-to-buy-dogecoin/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) appears to be gearing up for a bullish reversal after enduring a prolonged downtrend. Notably, a crypto analyst has shared a technical report outlining four compelling reasons why now may be an opportune time to buy DOGE. With the meme coin expected to execute a breakout to new price highs soon, purchasing it at a lower price could set investors and traders up for potentially huge gains. Why Dogecoin Is The Smart Buy Now TradingView crypto analyst KJThaLibra has shared a detailed chart analysis of Dogecoin, explaining why buying the meme coin at its current price may be the smartest move investors could make. The analyst highlighted four compelling reasons that support a potential bullish breakout for Dogecoin . The first and most compelling reason outlined by the analyst is the presence of a Bullish Divergence pattern on the Relative Strength Index (RSI). While DOGE’s price recently recorded a lower low, the RSI has printed a higher low, signaling weakening bearish momentum. This divergence often precedes trend reversals and has historically been a reliable early indicator of upside movement. The second reason emphasized by the TradingView analyst is that Dogecoin’s RSI has entered oversold territory on the daily chart. This suggests that selling pressure may be overextended, and a price bounce could be imminent as buyers regain control. Further supporting this is the formation of a higher low in price action. This structural development breaks the pattern of lower lows that have defined Dogecoin’s multi-month downtrend . A higher low on the daily chart reflects a possibly strengthening market sentiment and a potential reversal from bearish conditions. Notably, Dogecoin’s higher low is positioned just below a critical descending trendline that has acted as a resistance since 2024, adding further weight to it’s bullish setup . Confirmed Resistance Sets Stage For Major DOGE Rally The aforementioned descending trendline has been tested multiple times by Dogecoin in the past. KJThaLibra has stated that typically, the more frequently a resistance trendline is respected, the more intense a breakout tends to be once it is finally breached. With Dogecoin currently trading just below this critical trendline, a decisive breakout above it, especially supported by strong volume , could trigger a wave of momentum, potentially propelling the meme coin’s price to new highs. According to KJThaLibra’s chart, the projected scenario points to a rally toward $0.4. This bullish thesis, underpinned by the confirmed resistance, is the final reason the analyst believes now is a good time to buy Dogecoin. Notably, the trajectory of the outlook involves a breakout above the trendline, followed by a brief retest of the broken resistance as a new support and then a possible bullish continuation to higher price levels . Currently, Dogecoin is trading at $0.18, meaning a surge to $0.4 would represent an impressive 122.22% increase.",Dogecoin|Bullish Divergence|Descending Trendline|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|KJThaLibra|meme coin|relative strength index|RSI,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-06-09 17:30:58

Telegram’s founder, Pavel Durov, pointed out that TON retained a leading position as a venue for NFT trading. TON is the second most active chain for NFT trading after Ethereum, thanks to the growth of Telegram Collectible Gifts . Pavel Durov, Telegram’s founder, pointed out the collection increased its activity rapidly in the past 30 days. Telegram Collectible Gifts went up in price several times in the past 30 days. TON is now the #1 blockchain by daily NFT trading volume (or #2 after Ethereum if off-chain trades are not counted). Data: https://t.co/RpDBtuccJH and https://t.co/b1hYZxDMMo pic.twitter.com/iGrF4O96qT — Pavel Durov (@durov) June 9, 2025 Gifts are integrated with all functions of the chat app and can be displayed in profiles, bought, and sold through the chat. The collectible gifts also move off-chain, and can be used as stickers in Telegram. Minting an NFT adds extra proof of ownership and the ability to trade. The popularity of gifts pushed TON ahead of Solana in terms of NFT activity, though still behind Ethereum with its large-scale legacy collections. Telegram took a novel approach, popularizing the collection of Stars and the ability to mint an NFT for a low fee. TON often gets ahead of Solana, though still lagging behind the on-chain NFT swaps on Ethereum. Telegram Collectible Gifts can also be swapped off-chain, with even higher activity and trading volumes. | Source: Dune Analytics The minting of NFT from gifts is also tied to the Telegram stars economy. The stars is a new type of digital reward token, also used on Telegram games. Boinkers was the game with the biggest production of stars, with over $821K in withdrawals. Unknown whales withdraw as much as $2M from the Telegram stars market. TON carries a total of 21 collections , some repeating well-known IPs like Pudgy Penguins. The additional collections are closer to classic NFT, while Telegram Collectible Gifts offer a more organic approach tied to the chat app. Telegram gift collections have existed for months, though they were off to a slow start. In the past few weeks, certain gifts acquired cult status, starting to generate hype with their price growth. Collectible gifts are scarce, with some of the most wanted stickers commanding higher prices. In total, Gifts achieved sales of over $36M , with more than half of the wallets created in 2025. The gifts are held in 184,021 wallets, creating an active user base, which also popularizes the collection on social media. Are NFTs still active? NFT volumes and speculation are still down over 95% across the board. Only the top collections are still changing hands. However, NFTs are not entirely forgotten. NFT lending has been abandoned, as most collections quickly erased 99% of their value. After the relaunch of OpenSea, the NFT marketplace reached its highest volume since 2023. PFP/avatar collections are still the most active, followed by art and utility NFT. The biggest obstacle to NFT activity was the lack of marketplaces, especially during the months when OpenSea was still building its new version. Telegram Collectible Gifts also picked up their activity after the launch of a dedicated trading platform, the Telegram Gifts Marketplace . The Telegram collections rely on rarity, which now led to a much higher valuation for some stickers. Initially, the items were minted at extremely low prices. The availability of liquidity and an open market, as well as the chance to start out small, is reviving NFT swaps on TON. Collectible gifts were first minted on-chain from February onward, gradually expanding their influence, as they are currently on the verge of an even bigger breakout on Telegram and other social media.

45728266,https://zycrypto.com/?p=107154,1749490347,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Standard Chartered Outlines When Solana Could Reach $500,https://zycrypto.com/standard-chartered-outlines-when-solana-could-reach-500/,"Standard Chartered has released a detailed forecast on the future price trajectory of Solana (SOL), predicting that the popular blockchain token could reach $500 by 2029. This optimistic long-term outlook comes alongside a more cautious near-term view, as the bank expects Solana to underperform compared to Ethereum over the next two to three years. According to Jeffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s global head of digital asset research, Solana’s price may climb to approximately $275 by the end of 2025, before pushing further towards $500 by 2029. However, he warned that in the short to medium term, Solana will likely lag Ethereum in terms of market momentum and value appreciation. Kendrick highlighted a key reason for this slower near-term growth, Solana’s current dominance in memecoin trading. While this niche has allowed the network to showcase its high throughput and low transaction fees, Kendrick notes that relying heavily on memecoin activity is both a strength and a weakness. “ Memecoin trading has stress-tested Solana’s infrastructure, but it is not a sustainable driver for growth,” he stated. According to the pundit, market participants appear to have discounted Solana’s future earnings potential based on this volatile and possibly waning sector. The analyst further introduced an insightful metric by comparing a blockchain’s market capitalization to its “GDP,” defined as the total revenue generated by applications and protocols operating on the network. Solana is undervalued by this measure, suggesting untapped potential beneath the surface. Looking forward, Kendrick anticipates that Solana’s true growth will be unlocked as it expands into new sectors requiring fast, low-cost transactions. Areas such as decentralized financial services, social networking platforms, and decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) could become key growth drivers. However, he cautioned that these sectors are still maturing and could take two to three years to develop fully, during which time ecosystem activity and Solana’s price momentum may slow down. Additionally, Standard Chartered projects that the ETH-to-SOL price ratio will increase from around 14 to 17 by the end of 2027, reflecting Ethereum’s expected near-term outperformance before the gap potentially narrows later on. Despite the promising long-term outlook, recent community debates, such as a rejected proposal to adjust Solana’s inflation rate, indicate ongoing challenges in boosting token value. Elsewhere, technical analysts like Ali Martinez have also noted bullish patterns, predicting on Monday a potential breakout for Solana beyond current levels, with some even speculating targets above $3,000 if a key inverse “cup and handle” pattern confirms. At press time, Solana was trading around $156, reflecting a modest 2.08% surge in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-09 17:32:27

45728484,https://zycrypto.com/?p=107156,1749490670,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Can Ethereum Keep Outshining Bitcoin and XRP in the Race for Big Money?,https://zycrypto.com/can-ethereum-keep-outshining-bitcoin-and-xrp-in-the-race-for-big-money/,"Ethereum is emerging as the preferred digital asset for institutional investors, outpacing both Bitcoin and XRP in capital inflows. According to CoinShares’ latest fund flows report dated June 2, 2025, Ether recorded $321 million in weekly inflows—more than any other crypto asset. Ether’s Institutional Surge Over the past six weeks, Ethereum has attracted $1.19 billion in institutional funds, including $889 million in the last month. Ether’s total assets under management (AUM) now exceed $14 billion, fueled by strong demand for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and a boost from spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. The $321 million inflow marks Ethereum’s strongest week since December 2024. With the digital asset market experiencing its seventh consecutive week of net inflows—$286 million this week alone—Ether’s dominance signals a trend of institutional diversification away from Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s Inflow Dilemma While the broader crypto market saw positive sentiment, Bitcoin bucked the trend. The asset posted $8 million in outflows, despite major purchases by firms like Michael Saylor’s Strategy. On June 3, Strategy added 705 BTC , bringing its holdings to 580,955 BTC. Japanese firm Metaplanet also acquired more BTC in the same week. Bitcoin prices dropped from a high of $111,000 to $106,000 following a New York court’s decision on former President Trump’s tariff proposal. The ruling triggered investor caution and contributed to Bitcoin’s tepid flow data. Yet, the decline does not suggest a mass exit. Instead, it indicates institutional hesitation amid macroeconomic uncertainties. XRP, once favored for its promise in cross-border payments, saw $28 million in outflows last week. The delay in the U.S. SEC decisions on its anticipated ETF hurt momentum. Despite positive year-to-date figures, monthly flows turned negative. Regulatory ambiguity remains a major hurdle. Source: Coinshares CoinShares also reported shifting geographic investment patterns. While the U.S. remained dominant with $199 million in inflows, other regions showed strength. Germany attracted $42.9 million, Australia $21.5 million, and Hong Kong reported $54.8 million—the highest since launching its crypto exchange-traded products over a year ago. What’s Next for Ethereum? Ethereum’s strong position comes amid broader market growth and rising utility in DeFi. Its advantage lies in active network use cases and growing adoption of ETH-based products. While dominant in market cap, Bitcoin now faces stiffer competition for institutional attention. XRP’s case highlights the influence of regulatory clarity on investment behavior. Until its legal status is resolved, XRP will likely trail its more established peers. Ethereum’s performance indicates a shift in institutional strategy. As DeFi platforms evolve and spot ETFs mature, ETH could remain a leader in the crypto investment race. Still, Bitcoin’s long-term appeal and XRP’s cross-border potential cannot be ruled out.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Ethereum News|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-09 17:37:50

Pepeto, an Ethereum-based project, combines zero-fee trading, a 281% staking yield, and a built-in educational hub, positioning itself as a utility-driven meme coin with real-time functionality. In contrast, Solaxy, a yet-to-launch Layer-2 solution for Solana’s congestion issues, has raised substantial funds but remains untested in the market. While Solaxy promises long-term infrastructure improvements, Pepeto is already delivering live products, audited contracts, and strong community growth. Pepeto: More Than a Meme, Built for Utility Pepeto is rapidly gaining momentum as a serious Ethereum-based project, not just another meme coin. It combines advanced tools like PepetoSwap with audited smart contracts to ensure security and transparency. The platform also has a seamless cross-chain bridge for quick and cheap swaps. Over $5.3 million has been raised in the ongoing Pepeto presale. REMINDER : LISTING APPLICATIONS IN PEPETO EXCHANGE ARE BEING VIEWED BY A DEDICATED TEAM, STARTING FROM TODAY. CHECK OFFIClAL WEBSITE TO FILL THE FORM IN. COMMENT $PEPETO ⬇️🔗 : https://t.co/uo5vOks5PH pic.twitter.com/Cjxbz0SFfw — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) April 24, 2025 Moreover, Pepeto ’s staking mechanism offers an aggressive 281% reward, attracting long-term holders looking for real gains. The e-learning hub aims to educate users while organically developing the ecosystem. These features position Pepeto for sustained user engagement and adoption. Furthermore, the project’s viral marketing, fueled by frog memes and the Elon connection, has provided some more momentum. A listing in a Tier 1 exchange will be added soon, making it more legit and liquid. Early buying at this high upside entry point is possible, as the current price is $0.000000133. Solaxy: Promising Layer-2, But Still Unlaunched Solaxy has drawn attention by raising over $44 million in presale, setting expectations for a high-profile launch. The new Layer-2 scaling solution is meant to resolve Solana’s congestion problem. This could result in faster and more reliable speeds in the Solana ecosystem when using transactions. However, Solaxy remains in presale, with eight days left until its final price of $0.001746 expires. Even though there is buzz, it has not taken off yet, which sounds like real functionality on exchanges. Listings and actual use cases have not materialized, and investors are continuing to be cautious. The potential of this project is to help Solana trading memes and the growth of Solana DeFi. But with congestion still unsolved on Solana, questions remain about Solaxy’s short-term impact. Until launch, it lacks the real-time ecosystem and utility that Pepeto already provides. Why Pepeto Leads the Pack Pepeto already operates with working products, real-time staking rewards, and zero-fee trading on PepetoSwap. The community's membership continues to rise, and the multi-chain bridge makes it simpler for users to exchange their cryptocurrencies. Unlike Solaxy, Pepeto is not limited to promises or future tech. Thanks to the 30% allocation from sales, stackers play a key role in the project. Marketing and other liquidity measures describe how the company intends to move forward firmly and develop. Besides being a meme, it is also an organized and operating crypto ecosystem. While Solaxy might have long-term potential, Pepeto is already delivering. The time to watch is over, Pepeto is active, evolving, and primed for the spotlight now. ABOUT PEPETO Pepeto is a cutting-edge cryptocurrency project blending the playful spirit of memecoins with a powerful utility-driven ecosystem. It features a zero-fee exchange, a cross-chain bridge for seamless swaps, and staking rewards designed to support the next generation of tokens.

Analysts See Ruvi AI (RUVI) as the Next Major Utility Project Following Its Path,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/missed-trons-trx-005-rise-analysts-see-ruvi-ai-ruvi-as-the-next-major-utility-project-following-its-path,"Tron (TRX) recently saw a modest yet significant rise of $0.05, capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts eager to ride its wave of success. However, for those who missed the boat, analysts are turning their focus to Ruvi AI, a blockchain project with major utility potential that is quickly emerging as a top contender for investors. With a robust presale performance, clear growth roadmap, and real-world applications, Ruvi AI may very well follow, or even exceed, Tron’s path to utility-driven success. Tron’s $0.05 Rise Reflects Steady Growth Tron is well-regarded for its decentralized platform focused on content sharing and smart contracts. Its recent $0.05 increase is a testament to its steady adoption and growing utility within decentralized apps (dApps). However, as a more mature project, such gains are in line with its measured growth outlook, and investors often need to wait for incremental increases over time. For those seeking a faster route to substantial returns, emerging projects like Ruvi AI offer more immediate opportunities to get in on the ground floor of an innovative utility-focused token. Ruvi AI’s Presale Momentum Drives Investor Excitement Ruvi AI is making waves during its presale phase, boasting impressive milestones that showcase its rising popularity. The project has already raised over $1.6 million and sold more than 140 million tokens during its Phase 2 presale, where tokens are priced at a low $0.015 per token. Investors who participated in Phase 1 saw a 50% ROI in mere weeks, cementing Ruvi AI as one of the year’s most promising blockchain ventures. Unlike many speculative projects, Ruvi AI operates with a predefined valuation trajectory, offering clarity and confidence to early participants. Upon completion of its presale, the token price will rise to $0.07, as outlined in the roadmap. Analysts have additionally predicted the token may reach a $1 valuation post-listing, giving early adopters massive upside potential. Real-World Applications Elevate Ruvi AI’s Utility What makes Ruvi AI stand out is its dedication to solving real-world problems across multiple industries by integrating blockchain and artificial intelligence. Its practical applications include: Healthcare: Ruvi AI empowers hospitals and care providers with AI-driven diagnostics, improved patient management, and better operational workflows. Logistics: Businesses can optimize supply chains, cut costs, and improve delivery timelines through Ruvi AI’s smart solutions. Finance: From enhanced fraud protection to secure and efficient financial transactions, Ruvi AI’s blockchain-assisted systems deliver innovation where it matters most. This broad functionality ensures Ruvi AI’s scalability and places it in a strong position for long-term adoption and growth. Unlike Tron, which primarily focuses on content-sharing ecosystems, Ruvi AI’s multi-industry focus expands its potential user base and ensures diversified demand. WEEX Partnership Boosts Credibility and Accessibility A recent highlight in Ruvi AI’s rapid evolution is its partnership with WEEX Exchange, a well-known trading platform. This collaboration improves Ruvi AI’s accessibility and liquidity, making it easier for investors worldwide to acquire the token. Partnerships like this enhance Ruvi AI’s reputation and demonstrate its focus on building a sustainable, credible ecosystem that instills investor confidence. Lucrative Returns Through VIP Investment Tiers Ruvi AI also offers an innovative VIP investment tier system, enabling early adopters to maximize their returns. Here’s a breakdown of the tiers: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. This tiered system presents an unparalleled opportunity for investors to achieve life-changing returns early, long before Ruvi AI’s post-listing growth takes off. Ruvi AI Is Ready to Follow Tron’s Path to Success While Tron’s steady rise reinforces its role in the dApp and blockchain ecosystem, Ruvi AI is carving out a path where faster returns and scalable utility meet. With over $1.6 million raised, 140 million tokens sold, and applications across diverse industries, Ruvi AI is well-positioned to become a standout utility project following in Tron’s footsteps. For investors eager to catch the next big opportunity, Ruvi AI’s presale is a rare chance to secure a stake in a project that’s set to shine both in the near-term and as a long-term player in the blockchain space. The question isn’t whether Ruvi AI has potential, but whether you’re ready to act before its value skyrockets.

The associations said the initiative is a step forward to protecting developers of non-custodial, peer-to-peer technologies while maintaining strong oversight of custodial financial institutions. The group noted that the updated bill reflects a careful balance – building on FinCEN’s 2019 guidance to clarify that developers and infrastructure providers shouldn’t be regulated like money transmitters when they don’t control customer funds. Coin Center’s Neeraj Agrawal argued that it was more important than ever as the DOJ, through their prosecutions, had ignored their guidance. BRCA aims to help software developers 🥳 New text of CLARITY Act in the House includes clarity for non-custodial devs on the question of unlicensed money transmission. Codifies the 2019 FinCEN guidance! Thank you to @RepFrenchHill , @RepBryanSteil , and of course BRCA original sponsors @GOPMajorityWhip and @RepRitchie ! https://t.co/DtxaNunSxn — Peter Van Valkenburgh (@valkenburgh) June 8, 2025 A group of prominent crypto policy organizations in Washington have issued a joint statement noting that Congress has incorporated the BRCA into market structure legislation. The associations include the Coin Center, the DeFi Education Fund, the Solana Policy Institute, The Digital Chamber, the Blockchain Association, the Crypto Council for Innovation, the Bitcoin Policy Institute, Paradigm, Uniswap Labs, and Jump Crypto. The organizations noted that developers in the U.S. are creating peer-to-peer, non-custodial software, and the infrastructure providers who enable decentralized networks have little in common with traditional financial institutions and should not be treated as such. According to the Blockchain Foundation, BRCA acknowledges that reality and ensures that when software developers do not control or custody customer funds, they are not required to register as money-transmitting businesses. Tom Emmer initially proposed the amendment on May 21 and has since gained bipartisan support, including from Senator Ritchie Torres. The bill aims to include clear protections for software developers and companies that support decentralized networks. “Our bill brings long-overdue clarity to the digital asset ecosystem, prioritizes consumer protection and American innovation, and builds off our work in the 118th Congress.” -French Hill, Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. Hill introduced the CLARITY Act on May 29, admitting it aims to establish a regulatory framework for crypto assets in the U.S., providing the long-awaited clarity and protection for the industry. The Financial Services Committee has scheduled a markup for the CLARITY Act for June 10, 2025, alongside multiple other bills. Emmer argued that the U.S. should be the global home for responsible innovation, not a place where developers are punished for building open-source software or experimenting with new technologies. She also believes that the legislation protects innovation, upholds civil rights, and strengthens the U.S.’ global competitiveness in the 21st-century economy. The CLARITY Act focuses on dividing responsibilities between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CTFC) regarding the regulation of digital assets. On June 2 , the group also requested Congress to refrain from adding new sections to the stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act , which they feared could delay progress. GENIUS Act advances to the Senate for approval A Foresight Ventures report noted that the Genius Act could boost the U.S. dollar’s dominance in Web3 by enforcing 1:1 stablecoin backing and compliance. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act aims to set clear rules for stablecoin collateralization and mandate compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws. The legislation advanced the bill in a 66-32 vote on May 20, establishing the first regulatory framework for issuers of stablecoins. The bill had garnered aggravated concerns among Democrats about the association between the Trump family’s crypto dealings and World Liberty Financial. The legislation includes a provision prohibiting any member of Congress or senior executive branch official from issuing a payment stablecoin product during their time in public service. Other Senate Democrats have also introduced bills targeting the Trump family’s crypto ventures to prevent the President from potentially profiting off of the deals. Senator Michael Bennet for Colorado plans to propose the STABLE Act, which would prevent elected officials and federal candidates from issuing or endorsing digital assets, as an amendment to the GENIUS Act.

Speaking at the Money20/20 conference in Amsterdam, Hoskinson framed his forecast not as mere speculation but as a reflection of accelerating global crypto adoption, regulatory evolution, and Institutional interest. He pointed to macroeconomic shifts and technological developments as key drivers behind his long-term Bitcoin valuation. “We’re entering a phase where crypto is no longer fringe,” he stated . “ Major financial institutions and corporate giants are now building bridges into our space, not just experimenting, but developing infrastructure that can seamlessly interact with public blockchain protocols.” He likened this transition to the early days of Wi-Fi, where formerly siloed systems are finally becoming interoperable. “We’re approaching a finance Wi-Fi moment,” Hoskinson added, referring to the emerging connectivity between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). According to him, these integrations pave the way for a new global financial architecture where value can move frictionlessly across platforms and jurisdictions. Bitcoin’s emerging role in decentralized finance is a cornerstone of his argument . While DeFi ecosystems have largely been dominated by Ethereum, Solana, and other smart contract platforms, Hoskinson believes Bitcoin remains a sleeping giant. “The DeFi opportunity around Bitcoin is at least four times the size of that of Ethereum and Solana combined,” he said. “ Cardano, with its UTXO-based model, is uniquely positioned to become the computational layer that enables this.” Hoskinson also discussed the role of privacy and identity as essential features of the next financial wave. He touched on “Midnight,” a Cardano-linked project set to launch later this year. It aims to enable customizable privacy for blockchain applications, critical in a world that demands both regulatory compliance and user confidentiality. He envisions a future where compliance and privacy are not mutually exclusive but programmable, using smart contracts that determine what data is disclosed and to whom. He concluded by asserting that Bitcoin’s trajectory is now deeply intertwined with global finance. “We’re not just dealing with speculation anymore; we’re building an entirely new financial fabric. With the level of institutional interest we’re seeing, $1 million Bitcoin by 2030 isn’t just possible, it’s probable.” That said, the pundit’s $1 million Bitcoin forecast aligns with a similarly ambitious outlook from ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood, who envisions the leading cryptocurrency reaching even greater heights by the decade’s end. In a recent interview on The Diary of a CEO podcast, Wood projected that Bitcoin could climb as high as $1.5 million by 2030, citing factors driving long-term growth. She explained that one of the key drivers is the rising wave of institutional adoption. Firms like Arkham, Strategy, and Metaplanet are among those embracing Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, a trend she expects to accelerate. While acknowledging the asset’s notorious volatility, Wood emphasized that this is diminishing as Bitcoin matures and more investors hold it for the long haul.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|Bitcoin News|Cardano|Charles Hoskinson,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-09 17:54:17

Ethereum Reaches Critical Inflection Point as Blockchain Moves Beyond Speculation, Says Bernstein Analysts “Bitcoin is great, we love it, and we still believe $200,000 is a conservative high price estimate this cycle,” the analysts wrote. “However, mainstream interest is expanding beyond Bitcoin’s ‘store of value’ role to financial innovations driven by blockchains. Ethereum deserves the love.” US spot Bitcoin ETFs, which launched in January 2024, have become one of the most successful investment vehicles in history, amassing over $120 billion in AUM. In comparison, spot Ethereum ETFs, approved in July 2024, currently manage around $9 billion. Modest in comparison, but increasingly significant as Ethereum’s market cap hits $300 billion, about one-seventh of Bitcoin’s $2.1 trillion size. Still, analysts argue that Ethereum’s value proposition is fundamentally different. “Ethereum functions as a decentralized computer, core blockchain innovations like stablecoins and tokenization are unique to Ethereum where it dominates the market share,” Chhugani said. Ethereum ETF inflows have increased sharply in recent weeks. Over the past 20 days, $815 million has flowed into Ethereum ETFs, bringing year-to-date net inflows to $658 million. The firm believes this signals a shift in narrative from crypto as a speculative asset to blockchain as a financial foundation. “This is the stage where crypto makes the leap from meme commerce to real finance,” the analysts said. “Blockchains now power capital markets, payments, and fintech applications, and Ethereum is at the center of this transformation.” Stablecoins, Tokenization, and Institutional Adoption The note points to the increasing adoption of stablecoins and tokenized assets among large traditional players. Visa, Mastercard, and Stripe are developing stablecoin strategies, while Coinbase, Robinhood, and Kraken are launching blockchain-based payment and tokenization platforms. *This is not investment advice.

Simon Gerovich, Metaplanet’s CEO, said in a post on the social media platform X that the firm, which operates hotels but has pivoted to primarily focusing on accumulating Bitcoin, is about to raise ¥770.9 billion ($5.4 billion) to buy more BTC. According to Gerovich, Metaplanet will be issuing 555 million shares via moving strike warrants, which give holders the right to buy or sell the underlying asset but with a “moving” or variable strike price. The CEO says the capital raise follows Metaplanet’s “highly successful” strategy to acquire 100,000 BTC by the end of 2026, and 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027, which would give the company 1% of all the Bitcoin that will ever exist. According to BitcoinTreasuries.net , MetaPlanet has the 10th-largest corporate holding of BTC in the world, just behind Coinbase Global. Says Gerovich, “Thanks to all of our shareholders. We are honored to be on this journey with you. Metaplanet is accelerating into the future — powered by Bitcoin.” At time of writing, shares of MetaPlanet are trading at ¥1,554, up 15% on the day and up 24% since the close on Friday.

This new all-time high comes amid expanding use cases and growing global adoption, sparking fresh speculation about a potential price breakout in the near future. According to data from Shib.io, as of Monday, the total number of SHIB holders has reached approximately 1,511,101, reflecting a steady increase, with nearly 3,000 new wallets added in just under two weeks since late May. While the daily addition of holders may seem modest, the overall trend points to sustained interest and expanding community engagement. LUCIE, Shiba Inu’s ecosystem marketing strategist, celebrated the milestone tweeting , “SHIB HOLDERS HIT NEW ATH! 1,511,101 wallets now hold SHIB — that’s 0.011% of global population. The army is growing. The mission is alive.” Alongside retail enthusiasm, significant whale activity has been observed. Over the past week, massive transfers of SHIB tokens, totaling roughly 7.5 trillion tokens valued at over $100 million, have been moved into Coinbase Institutional wallets. Notably, such moves could mean big holders are either preparing to sell for profits or rebalance, or that institutions are positioning for long-term involvement. Though motives aren’t clear, this activity shows SHIB’s growing significance beyond meme coin hype. Elsewhere, the Shiba Inu ecosystem continues to expand. Developments such as Shibarium, a Layer 2 blockchain solution, and emerging decentralized finance (DeFi) applications built around SHIB contribute to a growing real-world use case narrative. These innovations help differentiate SHIB from other meme coins by adding utility and encouraging a more engaged community. Significant buying volume has also emerged near the $0.000012 to $0.000013 price range, as per data from indicating strong investor interest and a potential support zone. The surge in trading volume by nearly 41% in the past 24 hours points to heightened market activity that could precede a consolidation phase or even a breakout. Meanwhile, despite the positive adoption signals, one headwind impacting price momentum is a sharp 63% drop in SHIB’s daily token burn rate . This decline in token burns raises concerns about SHIB’s ability to maintain deflationary pressure in the short term. That said, SHIB’s price action has also shown mixed trends with price trading mostly sideways. After hitting lows of $0.00001204 last Friday, the token recovered slightly over the weekend and was trading at $0.00001254 at press time, reflecting a 0.33% drop in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|SHIB|SHIBA INU,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-09 18:08:57

For those tracking the cryptocurrency market, understanding these broader macroeconomic trends is crucial, as they can significantly influence investor sentiment and capital flows. Recently, we’ve seen notable movement in the Euro Dollar exchange rate , with the Euro showing strength against the US Dollar. This shift isn’t happening in a vacuum; it’s largely tied to evolving prospects for interest rate cuts by major central banks. Understanding the Forces Behind the Euro Dollar Exchange Rate The relationship between the Euro (EUR) and the US Dollar (USD) is one of the most closely watched currency pairs globally. Its value is influenced by a multitude of factors, but central bank monetary policy, particularly decisions around interest rate cuts or hikes, plays a paramount role. When a central bank signals or enacts lower interest rates, it can make that currency less attractive to foreign investors seeking higher yields, potentially leading to depreciation. Conversely, expectations of higher rates or delayed cuts can strengthen a currency. The recent performance of the Euro Dollar exchange rate reflects a change in market expectations regarding the timing and pace of rate cuts by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the US Federal Reserve (Fed). European Central Bank (ECB) Outlook: The market has been pricing in potential rate cuts from the ECB, possibly starting sooner than the Fed. However, recent economic data and comments from ECB officials have introduced some uncertainty, leading to speculation about the pace of future cuts after an initial move. Federal Reserve (Fed) Outlook: Expectations for the Federal Reserve’s rate cuts have also shifted. Initially, aggressive cuts were anticipated, but persistent inflation and robust economic data in the US have tempered these expectations. The market now anticipates fewer cuts, or cuts starting later than previously thought. This relative shift – where the Fed might cut later or less aggressively than initially believed, while the ECB’s path remains data-dependent but still potentially involves cuts – narrows the expected interest rate differential between the Eurozone and the US. A smaller differential can make the Euro relatively more attractive compared to the Dollar, providing upward pressure on the Euro Dollar exchange rate . How Do Expected Interest Rate Cuts Impact Currencies? The prospect of interest rate cuts is a major driver for currency markets. Here’s a breakdown of the typical impact: For a Currency (like the USD in this scenario): Lower expected rates reduce the yield on government bonds and other interest-bearing assets denominated in that currency. This makes the currency less attractive to foreign investors seeking yield, potentially leading to reduced demand and depreciation. Conversely, if expectations for cuts are pushed back, or hikes are considered, the currency can strengthen as yields remain relatively high or are expected to rise. For a Currency (like the EUR in this scenario): Similarly, lower expected rates reduce yields on Euro-denominated assets. However, the *relative* difference matters. If the ECB is expected to cut less aggressively or later than another central bank (though the current scenario is more about the Fed cutting *later* than the ECB), or if market sentiment shifts towards the ECB maintaining rates longer than previously thought relative to others, the Euro can strengthen. The current Euro strength is partly due to the market adjusting its view on how much the Fed will cut versus the ECB’s expected path, narrowing the yield gap. Therefore, the recent gains in the Euro Dollar exchange rate are a direct consequence of this recalibration of interest rate cuts expectations by market participants for both the ECB and the Federal Reserve. What is the Current EUR USD Forecast Looking Like? Predicting the future movement of any currency pair, including the EUR USD forecast , is complex and subject to numerous variables. However, based on current central bank stances and economic indicators, analysts are adjusting their outlooks. Key factors influencing the near-term EUR USD forecast include: Inflation Data: Both Eurozone and US inflation reports are critical. Higher-than-expected inflation could delay rate cuts, while cooling inflation could accelerate them. Economic Growth: Stronger growth might give central banks less urgency to cut rates, while weaker growth could pressure them to ease monetary policy. Central Bank Communication: Statements and speeches from ECB and Fed officials are closely scrutinized for clues about future policy direction. Geopolitical Events: Global events can introduce uncertainty and drive safe-haven flows, impacting currency valuations. While specific price targets vary widely among analysts, the general sentiment acknowledges that the path of ECB interest rates and Federal Reserve rates will be the primary determinant of the EUR USD forecast in the coming months. A divergence in policy paths, where one central bank moves significantly differently or earlier than the other, could lead to more pronounced movements in the pair. The Role of ECB Interest Rates The European Central Bank’s monetary policy decisions are paramount for the Euro’s value. The level of ECB interest rates directly impacts borrowing costs, inflation, and economic activity across the Eurozone. When the ECB signals or implements rate cuts, it aims to stimulate economic growth, but it can also potentially weaken the Euro relative to currencies where rates are stable or rising. Recent discussions around ECB interest rates have focused on the timing of the first rate cut. While a June cut is widely anticipated by markets, the subsequent path remains uncertain, dependent on incoming data, particularly on services inflation and wage growth. The ECB’s communication style and forward guidance on the future trajectory of rates will be key in shaping market expectations and, consequently, the Euro’s performance. Understanding Federal Reserve Rates and Their Influence Similarly, the Federal Reserve’s decisions on Federal Reserve rates are the main driver for the US Dollar’s value. The Fed Funds rate influences borrowing costs throughout the US economy and impacts global capital flows. When the Fed is expected to cut rates, it can weigh on the Dollar, as dollar-denominated assets become less attractive compared to those in countries with higher yields. Expectations for Federal Reserve rates have been particularly volatile. Strong US economic data and sticky inflation in early 2024 led to a significant repricing, with the market anticipating fewer rate cuts than previously thought. This resilience in the US economy and the resulting delay in expected Fed cuts initially supported the Dollar. However, any signs of slowing US growth or cooling inflation could quickly shift expectations back towards earlier or more aggressive cuts, potentially weakening the Dollar against currencies like the Euro. Connecting Forex Trends to the Crypto Market While the article focuses on traditional currencies, it’s important for crypto enthusiasts to understand these dynamics. Macroeconomic conditions, influenced heavily by central bank policies and interest rate cuts , affect overall market liquidity and investor risk appetite. When global liquidity tightens due to higher interest rates or delayed cuts (especially by the Fed, given the Dollar’s global role), it can sometimes lead to a rotation out of riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, expectations of easing monetary policy and lower rates can increase liquidity and potentially support risk assets. Therefore, tracking the outlook for ECB interest rates and Federal Reserve rates , and observing the resulting movements in the Euro Dollar exchange rate , provides valuable context for understanding the broader financial environment in which the crypto market operates. It helps anticipate potential shifts in market sentiment driven by changes in global monetary policy. Challenges and Actionable Insights Challenges: Data Dependency: Central bank decisions are heavily dependent on incoming economic data, which can be unpredictable. Central Bank Communication: Interpreting subtle shifts in central bank language requires careful analysis. Geopolitical Risks: Unexpected global events can override economic fundamentals. Actionable Insights: Monitor key economic releases from the Eurozone and the US (inflation, employment, GDP). Pay close attention to speeches and press conferences by ECB and Fed officials. Understand that the EUR USD forecast is not static and will evolve with new information. Consider how shifts in global liquidity due to changing rate expectations might impact your investment strategy in various asset classes, including crypto. Conclusion: Navigating the Shifting Sands of Monetary Policy The recent strength of the Euro against the US Dollar highlights the critical role that expectations around interest rate cuts play in the Forex market. As both the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve navigate their paths towards potentially easing monetary policy, the relative timing and magnitude of their actions will continue to shape the Euro Dollar exchange rate . For investors across all markets, including cryptocurrency, keeping an eye on these central bank dynamics and the resulting currency movements provides essential insights into the broader economic forces at play.

After periods of intense price swings, observers are noting a significant shift: a noticeable drop in Bitcoin volatility . This change isn’t just a minor blip; it’s reaching levels not seen in a year, according to leading crypto trading firms like QCP Capital. What is Driving the Drop in Bitcoin Volatility? Crypto trading firm QCP Capital recently highlighted on its Telegram channel that Bitcoin’s implied volatility continues its downward trend, now sitting at yearly lows. This comes as the Bitcoin price remains stubbornly range-bound, failing to make significant moves up or down. Implied volatility is essentially the market’s expectation of how much the price of an asset will move in the future. When it drops like this, it suggests traders and investors anticipate less price fluctuation ahead. Several factors likely contribute to this phenomenon: Lack of Clear Catalysts: There haven’t been major, market-moving news events recently. Regulatory clarity remains elusive, significant institutional adoption announcements are sparse, and no major protocol upgrades for Bitcoin are on the immediate horizon. Macro Environment Stalemate: While macro factors like inflation data and central bank decisions usually influence crypto, recent events haven’t provided a strong directional push for the crypto market . The uncertainty might be leading to a ‘wait and see’ approach. Post-Event Lull: Following periods of high excitement or significant price movements (like the rally earlier in the year), markets often enter a consolidation phase where volatility naturally declines. Historical Patterns and Market Analysis QCP Capital pointed out that historical patterns suggest this low volatility environment could persist, potentially dropping further through July. Markets often experience a slowdown during the summer months, sometimes referred to as ‘summer doldrums,’ as trading activity decreases. This aligns with the current trend observed in market analysis . This period of reduced volatility isn’t necessarily negative, but it does signal a potential shift in market dynamics. It reflects a lack of strong conviction among participants regarding the immediate future direction of the Bitcoin price . Signs of Market Fatigue and Trader Positioning The report from QCP Capital explicitly mentions that the market is showing ‘signs of fatigue.’ What does this fatigue look like on the ground? Sideways Price Action: The most obvious sign is Bitcoin trading within a relatively narrow range, failing to break out convincingly in either direction. Lower Trading Volume: Often, periods of low volatility coincide with decreased trading volume as speculative interest wanes and participants await a clearer trend. Indecision: The market isn’t clearly bullish or bearish. There’s a balance between buyers and sellers, leading to stagnation. Interestingly, despite the current lull and fatigue, QCP Capital noted that traders are extending their bullish bets further out in time, specifically into September. This behavior might seem counterintuitive during a low-volatility period but reflects growing indecision about the near term. Traders aren’t necessarily bearish, but they aren’t confident enough for aggressive short-term directional plays. Instead, they are placing bets on a potential price increase occurring later in the year, perhaps anticipating catalysts like potential shifts in monetary policy or renewed institutional interest towards the end of Q3 or in Q4. This requires a careful trading strategy . Implications for Your Trading Strategy A low-volatility environment demands adjustments to one’s trading strategy . What worked during volatile periods might not be effective now. Challenges: Breakout Strategies Struggle: Strategies reliant on capturing large moves after price breaks out of a range will likely face multiple false signals or simply not trigger. Reduced Profit Potential for Directional Bets: If you’re betting on a large move up or down, the slow price action means it will take longer (if ever) to reach your target, tying up capital. Potential Opportunities & Adjustments: Range Trading: Trading within the established price channel, buying near support and selling near resistance, can be effective. Options Strategies: Selling options (like covered calls or puts) can be profitable in low-volatility environments as the premium decays over time. However, this requires understanding options risk. Accumulation: Long-term investors might view this as a period to accumulate Bitcoin at relatively stable prices before the next potential move. Focus on Altcoins: Sometimes, when Bitcoin is quiet, volatility shifts to altcoins. Traders might look for opportunities elsewhere in the crypto market , though this comes with higher risk. Patience: Perhaps the most crucial strategy is patience. Waiting for a clear trend to emerge before committing significant capital can prevent getting whipsawed by small, non-trending moves. Understanding the current market structure through careful market analysis is key to adapting your approach. What Could Break the Trend? While fatigue has set in and Bitcoin volatility is low, markets don’t stay quiet forever. Several potential catalysts could reignite volatility and drive the next significant move in the Bitcoin price : Macroeconomic Shifts: Clear signals on inflation, interest rate cuts (or hikes), or significant changes in global economic outlook. Regulatory Developments: Major news regarding crypto regulation in key jurisdictions like the US or Europe. Institutional Adoption News: Announcements of large firms or funds entering the space or launching new crypto products (like a spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the US, though the timeline is uncertain). Significant On-Chain Activity: Large movements of Bitcoin, changes in miner behavior, or significant increases in network usage. Black Swan Events: Unforeseen global events that drive investors towards or away from risk assets like Bitcoin. Until a strong catalyst emerges, the current low-volatility, range-bound environment for the crypto market may well persist, just as QCP Capital suggests. Conclusion: Navigating the Quiet Crypto Market The message from firms like QCP Capital is clear: Bitcoin volatility is currently subdued, hitting multi-month lows. This reflects a market showing signs of fatigue and indecision, influenced by a lack of immediate catalysts and a stable (if uncertain) macro backdrop. While traders are positioning for potential future moves, the present demands a careful and adapted trading strategy . Whether you’re range trading, exploring options, or simply waiting on the sidelines, understanding this low-volatility regime is crucial for navigating the current crypto market . Keep a close watch on potential catalysts that could eventually break the range and inject new life into the Bitcoin price action.

45730858,https://crypto.news/?p=14387274,1749496316,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/45730858.jpeg,Robinhood snubbed as S&P operator makes no changes: What’s next for HOOD stock?,https://crypto.news/robinhood-snubbed-as-sp-operator-makes-no-changes-whats-next-for-hood-stock/,"Robinhood’s stock has rallied hard in recent weeks on hopes of being added to the S&P 500 index, but many investors were disappointed with the announcment that S&P Dow Jones Indices will make no changes to the S&P 500 lineup S&P Dow Jones, the operator of the coveted S&P 500 index, confirmed Friday afternoon that it will make no changes to the index. Robinhood was widely considered to be the next stock added to the index so confirmation it will be left out sent Robinhood’s stock down sharply on Monday. Expectations were high as Bank of America analysts had recently called Robinhood the S&P 500’s “prime candidate” for inclusion. Robinhood’s stock was down around 5% Monday afternoon on a day when Bitcoin ( BTC ) moved higher. Robinhood has become big enough to qualify for the S&P 500. By mid-2025 its market capitalization was roughly $66 billion, well above the $20.5 billion minimum and far larger than most small-caps in the index. The company is U.S.-based, traded on Nasdaq, and otherwise meets S&P Global’s listing criteria. In fact, Robinhood’s stock doubled in 2025 leading up to the scheduled quarterly rebalance, reaching all-time highs as investors speculated on index inclusion. We can reasonably conclude that Robinhood was not excluded for failing to meet standards. Rather, it simply didn’t get a slot because the committee kept the lineup intact. Since the S&P 500 is a fixed roster of 500 stocks, adding a company requires removing another. In this case, the committee evidently saw no need to swap anyone out. As such, the omission was a matter of timing and index procedure, not a rating of the business itself. Recent Additions to the S&P 500 For context, the last companies actually added to the S&P 500 came in May and March 2025. On May 19, rival cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global became the first digital-asset company to enter the benchmark. Earlier, on March 24, DoorDash (DASH), communication firm TKO Group (TKO), retailer Williams-Sonoma (WSM), and oil-and-gas company Expand Energy (EXE) joined the index. Those names replaced Discover Financial, BorgWarner, Teleflex, Celanese and FMC. By comparison, the June rebalance brought no newcomers. Simply put, Robinhood missed its chance because the S&P 500 held steady. You might also like: The Coinbase hack that shadowed its S&P rise — and the investigators who saw it coming What If Robinhood Had Been Included? When a stock is added, all S&P-tracking funds must buy shares, often driving the price higher. When smaller companies join a major index, “millions of dollars could potentially flow to them” just from passive buying. Consider that the largest S&P 500 ETF (SPY) manages well over half a trillion dollars so any addition forces huge purchases. Moreover, index membership increases a stock’s visibility. In practical terms, that means a new S&P 500 addition often enjoys extra demand and publicity (at least in the short term) as mutual funds, pension plans and ETFs buy the stock. This “index effect” has historically lifted many stocks a few percent when they join the 500. In Robinhood’s case, analysts estimated that inclusion could have lifted it several percent higher, it had already spiked on the mere expectation of joining. What’s Next for Robinhood? Looking ahead, Robinhood remains well-positioned and continues to meet S&P requirements, so its candidacy remains intact. When another slot opens up, for instance when a current member is removed due to a takeover or other corporate action, Robinhood would likely be reconsidered. The pending Nippon Steel–U.S. Steel deal is the next possible catalyst outside of the regular shuffle for an index inclusion so it may be a matter of when, and not if Robinhood is promoted to the club. The next S&P 500 rebalancing (usually in September) may offer a fresh opportunity for Robinhood.",News|Bitcoin|Coinbase|Robinhood,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DASH|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-06-09 19:11:56

The operation allegedly used a Gold Coast-based security company to move cash and convert it to cryptocurrency. Authorities seized US$13 million in assets, including properties and vehicles, across two states. Australian law enforcement agencies have charged four people over an alleged money laundering scheme that moved illicit funds through a network of businesses and converted large volumes of cash into cryptocurrency. According to a June 9 statement , the charges follow an 18-month investigation coordinated by the Queensland Joint Organised Crime Taskforce (QJOCTF). Money Laundering Network Used Security Firm to Move Illicit Gains The operation allegedly used a Gold Coast-based security company to transfer A$190 million (~ US$123 million) in cash, some of which was mixed with legitimate business income and converted into crypto. The Australian Federal Police-led taskforce restrained assets worth approximately A$21 million (~ US$13 million) across Queensland and New South Wales, including 17 properties and multiple vehicles. Authorities executed 14 search warrants in Brisbane and the Gold Coast on June 5 and 6. The QJOCTF alleges the security company used courier services and complex banking arrangements to conceal the origin of the funds. Dead drops were used to collect cash in multiple Australian cities; the cash, which was then transported to Queensland by air and funneled into the laundering network. A 32-year-old Brisbane man linked to a sales promotion company allegedly received A$9.5 million (~ US$6.2 million) in cash and cryptocurrency and attempted to obscure his involvement by using his wife as a nominal company director. He has been charged and remanded in custody. Two other people, a 48-year-old man and a 35-year-old woman who directed and managed the security company, have been charged and granted bail. A fourth man, aged 58, allegedly operated a classic car business used to launder an additional A$6.4 million (~ US$4.2 million) and is facing multiple offenses. Keep your crypto records in check! — ato.gov.au (@ato_gov_au) March 13, 2025 Crypto Use in Cash Crimes Spurs Regulatory and Enforcement Collaboration The Australian Border Force, AUSTRAC, the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, and the Australian Taxation Office also contributed to the investigation. Authorities said inquiries into the origins of the full AUD $190 million remain ongoing. Criminal groups are increasingly using cryptocurrency to disguise large cash movements, prompting regulators to enhance blockchain tracing capabilities. Authorities worldwide are targeting how cash-based schemes exploit crypto platforms to avoid detection. In the meantime, cross-agency cooperation is becoming increasingly important when it comes to combating sophisticated criminal activities. Australian taskforces combining financial, customs, and crypto oversight may become a model for future investigations, especially as laundering networks operate across both physical and digital channels. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How do criminals typically integrate cryptocurrency into laundering operations? Criminals may convert cash into crypto via over-the-counter brokers, exchanges, or complicit businesses. Funds are then moved across wallets or platforms to reduce traceability before converting back to fiat or using them directly for purchases. What is the role of a “straw director” in financial crimes? A straw director is a person listed as a company director in name only, while control rests with another person. This tactic is often used to obscure real ownership and avoid legal accountability. How do “dead drops” function in laundering networks? Dead drops involve leaving cash at prearranged locations for pickup by couriers. This method avoids direct handovers and reduces exposure but requires tight coordination and is often used by large-scale operations.

When utility takes precedence over speculation, projects like Ruvi AI and Ripple (XRP) come into sharp focus. With Ruvi AI making waves during its presale and Ripple continuing to grow its cross-border payment solutions, the question is clear: which is better positioned to dominate the next bull run? Ripple’s established utility in cross-border transactions For years, Ripple has been the go-to cryptocurrency for seamless international payments. Its speed and low transaction fees have made it a favorite among financial institutions aiming to disrupt traditional banking systems. Ripple’s partnerships with prominent banks and payment providers add credibility to its standing in the crypto world. However, Ripple’s growth has been slowed by ongoing regulatory challenges, particularly in the United States. While it remains relevant, its role as a payment-focused platform limits its scalability compared to more versatile projects. Ruvi AI’s meteoric presale success Ruvi AI has positioned itself as a serious contender in the utility-driven token space. The project has already raised over $1.6 million and sold more than 140 million tokens during its presale, reflecting strong investor confidence. With a Phase 2 price of $0.015 per token, Ruvi AI offers an accessible entry point for those seeking high returns. Its structured valuation system stands out from the speculative pricing many new tokens rely on. At the end of the presale, Ruvi AI’s price will increase to $0.07, and analysts project it could climb to $1 per token post-listing, delivering massive returns for early adopters. These carefully planned milestones make Ruvi AI a clear choice for ROI-focused investors. Practical applications fuel Ruvi AI’s growth potential What makes Ruvi AI especially attractive is its focus on solving real-world problems through the integration of blockchain and artificial intelligence. Unlike Ripple, which is largely confined to financial transactions, Ruvi AI offers a diversified approach with disruptive potential across multiple industries: Healthcare: Ruvi AI’s AI-powered tools aim to improve medical diagnostics, streamline patient care, and reduce inefficiencies in healthcare systems. Logistics: By optimizing supply chains, Ruvi AI provides solutions that cut costs and enhance operational efficiency for businesses. Finance: Leveraging AI, Ruvi AI offers advanced fraud detection and transparency in transactions, making it a valuable asset for financial institutions. These use cases underscore Ruvi AI’s scalability and show why it has the potential to thrive across a wide range of industries, ensuring strong demand as adoption increases. WEEX exchange partnership adds credibility Ruvi AI’s credibility received a significant boost with its recent partnership with WEEX Exchange, a respected platform that enhances the project’s accessibility to global investors. Collaborations like this not only validate Ruvi AI’s legitimacy but also ensure liquidity and market reach. This strategic move establishes Ruvi AI as an emerging player with a clear commitment to long-term growth. VIP investment tiers deliver exceptional rewards Ruvi AI’s presale includes a VIP investment system that rewards early adopters with significant bonuses. This approach is designed to maximize investor returns and showcases the project’s commitment to backers. Here’s a breakdown of the tiers: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. This transparent and lucrative rewards system makes Ruvi AI a standout choice for investors aiming for high ROI. Ripple vs. Ruvi AI – who wins the bull run? While Ripple brings regulatory challenges and a narrower focus to the table, Ruvi AI offers versatility, scalability, and a structured growth plan designed to deliver exceptional returns. Its success across sectors like healthcare, logistics, and finance further cements its reputation as a future-ready project. For investors seeking practical utility and incredible growth potential, Ruvi AI has all the markings of a utility giant set to lead the next bull run.

As one court has stated, when a third party illegally uses an autonomous vehicle for their own benefit, you hold the perpetrator responsible, not the vehicle manufacturer.

The company now holds 582,000 BTC in its reserves, acquired for a total of $40.79 billion at an average price of about $70,086 per Bitcoin. The purchase comes as no surprise — Strategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor had already hinted at the deal on June 8. He has turned bitcoin accumulation into a true art form. Bitcoin rushes to records again Strategy’s timing is, admittedly, pretty good. Bitcoin is trading at $107,750, less than 4% off the all-time high of $111,000 recorded in May. Is the company buying at the peak? Or does that peak only seem like a peak? The company’s aggressive approach echoes the sentiments of financial educator Robert Kiyosaki, best known for ”Rich Dad Poor Dad.” Kiyosaki has been a vocal advocate for bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and frequently urges investors to consider digital assets as part of a strategic portfolio. His bullish stance on cryptocurrency aligns with Strategy’s relentless accumulation, highlighting a growing trend among influential financial thinkers and major corporations alike. Strategy clearly has no intention of stopping. The company recently announced a $1 billion stock offering — four times the originally announced $250 million. Where will the money go? That’s right — to buy more bitcoin and cover corporate expenses. A new tool for investors An interesting detail: the company is issuing 11.76 million shares of Series A Perpetual Stride preferred stock at $85 each. These securities promise a non-cumulative dividend of 10% — an attractive option for institutional investors seeking yield. After deducting underwriting expenses, Strategy expects to net about $979 million. That’s a solid amount to further build its bitcoin position. Strategy demonstrates enviable consistency in its bitcoin accumulation. Nine consecutive weeks of purchases is no longer an impulse, but a well-calibrated plan.

A significant development is on the horizon that could change how you gain exposure to the digital asset ecosystem. We’re talking about the potential launch of the very first Circle ETF products, offering targeted access to the company behind the popular USDC stablecoin. This isn’t just another broad crypto fund; these are specific, single-company plays bringing unique strategies to the market. What’s Happening with the Circle ETF Filings? The news broke courtesy of Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, who shared details on X (formerly Twitter) about new filings related to Circle (CRCL). Two major players in the ETF space, ProShares and Bitwise , have submitted plans for exchange-traded funds that will specifically track or utilize strategies based on Circle’s performance or valuation. These aren’t your typical broad market funds. They fall under the category of Single-Stock ETF products, though in this case, tied to a company that has recently become publicly accessible (Circle underwent a public listing process). This is a notable step, offering investors a way to bet directly on the fortunes of a specific entity deeply embedded in the cryptocurrency world, rather than just the price movements of Bitcoin or Ethereum. According to the filings, both ETFs are targeting an August 20th launch date. While ticker symbols and detailed fee structures are still under wraps, the filings reveal distinct approaches from each firm: ProShares: Known for their leveraged and inverse products, ProShares is planning a 2x leveraged Circle ETF . This means the fund aims to deliver double the daily performance of Circle. If Circle goes up 5% in a day, the ETF aims to go up 10% (before fees and expenses). Conversely, if Circle drops 5%, the ETF aims to drop 10%. Bitwise: A firm more traditionally focused on direct crypto exposure and thematic funds, Bitwise is proposing a covered call strategy Circle ETF . This type of fund typically holds the underlying asset (in this case, tied to Circle’s performance) and sells call options against it to generate income. This strategy can potentially provide yield but often limits upside participation. These filings highlight the increasing sophistication and variety within the realm of Crypto ETFs , moving beyond simple spot or futures tracking to more complex, company-specific strategies. Why a Single-Stock ETF on Circle? Circle is a pivotal company in the digital asset space, primarily known as the issuer of USDC, one of the largest and most widely used stablecoins. Stablecoins are crucial for trading, lending, and transferring value within the crypto ecosystem, acting as a bridge between traditional finance and decentralized applications. Circle’s recent public listing brings its financial performance, growth trajectory, and regulatory standing into sharper focus for traditional investors. Offering a Single-Stock ETF allows investors who believe in Circle’s business model, the continued growth of stablecoins, or its position in the evolving regulatory landscape to express that view without necessarily buying shares directly (once widely available and easily accessible) or needing deep expertise in the underlying crypto technology. For firms like ProShares and Bitwise , launching products tied to a prominent crypto-adjacent company like Circle makes strategic sense as they look to capture different segments of investor interest in the digital asset market. Exploring the Strategies: Leveraged vs. Covered Call Understanding the strategies proposed by ProShares and Bitwise is crucial for potential investors. These aren’t ‘buy and hold’ strategies in the traditional sense and come with distinct risk profiles. ProShares’ 2x Leveraged Circle ETF: High Potential, High Risk A 2x leveraged ETF aims to magnify daily returns. While this can be appealing in a rising market, it introduces significant risks, especially in volatile conditions. Here’s why: Compounding Risk: Leveraged ETFs reset daily. Over longer periods, their performance can deviate significantly from 2x the underlying asset’s return due to the effects of compounding, particularly in choppy or sideways markets. Volatility: Increased leverage means increased sensitivity to price swings. A small negative move in Circle could result in a much larger percentage loss for the ETF investor on a given day. Best for Short-Term: These products are generally designed for short-term trading strategies rather than long-term investment. Investors considering the ProShares leveraged product must have a high risk tolerance and a deep understanding of how leveraged ETFs work. Bitwise’s Covered Call Circle ETF: Income Focus, Capped Upside A covered call strategy involves holding an asset and selling call options on it. The goal is typically to generate income from the option premiums. Income Generation: The primary benefit is the potential for regular income from selling options. This can be attractive in low-yield environments. Limited Upside: By selling call options, the fund gives up the right to benefit from large price increases in the underlying asset above the strike price of the sold options. If Circle’s performance surges, the covered call ETF will likely lag significantly compared to holding Circle directly or a non-covered call fund. Reduced Volatility (Potentially): The income generated can help cushion losses in moderately down markets, but it doesn’t eliminate downside risk. The Bitwise covered call product is geared towards investors seeking potential income and perhaps a slightly less volatile ride than a direct exposure product, but they must accept limiting their participation in strong upward moves by Circle. How Do These Compare to Other Crypto ETFs? These proposed Circle ETFs are fundamentally different from existing spot Bitcoin or Ethereum ETFs. Spot crypto ETFs hold the actual underlying cryptocurrencies. These new funds are tied to a *company* operating in the crypto space. This means their performance will be driven by Circle’s business success, profitability, regulatory compliance, and stock valuation, rather than the direct price movements of USDC or other cryptocurrencies. While both fall under the umbrella of Crypto ETFs in the broader sense of offering exposure to the digital asset economy, the mechanism and risk drivers are distinct. Investors should carefully consider whether they want exposure to the assets themselves or to the companies building infrastructure and services within the sector. Actionable Insights for Investors As the August 20th potential launch date approaches, here are some points for investors to consider: Do Your Homework: Understand Circle’s business model, financials (as they become more transparent post-listing), and the specific risks facing a stablecoin issuer (regulatory scrutiny, competition, reserve management). Know the ETF Strategy: A leveraged fund is not the same as a covered call fund. Understand the mechanics, goals, and risks of the specific product you are considering. The ProShares fund is for short-term, high-risk bets, while the Bitwise fund is more about income and potentially lower volatility (at the cost of upside). Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Single-stock ETFs, especially leveraged ones, carry concentration risk and can be highly volatile. Ensure these products align with your overall investment goals and risk profile. Wait for Details: Ticker symbols and fee structures are yet to be announced. Fees can significantly impact the net returns of leveraged and covered call strategies. Wait for the prospectus to get the full picture. These filings signal continued innovation in the ETF market catering to interest in digital assets. However, the complexity and risks associated with leveraged and covered call Single-Stock ETF products require careful consideration. Conclusion: A New Avenue for Crypto Exposure The filings by ProShares and Bitwise for Circle-based ETFs mark an exciting development, offering investors novel ways to gain exposure to a key player in the stablecoin market. The introduction of a 2x leveraged option by ProShares and a covered call strategy by Bitwise provides distinct choices catering to different investor objectives – from high-conviction, short-term directional bets to income generation with potentially reduced volatility. While the August 20th launch is anticipated, potential investors must dive deep into the specifics of each product and understand the inherent risks of leveraged and options-based strategies, particularly when applied to a single company in the dynamic crypto sector.

With potential for growth, these cryptocurrencies are generating buzz. Delve into the dynamics behind Solana , XRP , and Stellar to discover why they are the ones to keep an eye on in the current market climate. Solana Price Trends: Past Performance and Current Market Insights Solana 's price experienced a significant drop of 12.90% over the past month and a 29.61% decline in the last six months. These reductions highlight a sustained downtrend that has impacted investor confidence. The selling pressure during these periods has led to gradual price erosion, prompting traders to adopt a cautious approach. Frequent pullbacks have resulted in a bearish market sentiment, with many investors waiting for stronger signals before committing to higher price entries. Currently, Solana trades between $136 and $182.20, with immediate support at $115.84 and resistance at $207.90. A secondary resistance level is seen at $253.93, while lower support is around $69.81. Market indicators, such as an Awesome Oscillator reading of -15.55, signal ongoing bearish pressure despite prices being near critical levels. The RSI at 40.92 suggests the coin is nearing oversold territory. Traders may look to buy if support holds at $115.84, while a breakout above $207.90 could attract new buying interest. XRP: Past Momentum and Current Key Price Levels XRP has shown a slight downtrend, with a monthly loss of approximately 4.66% and a half-year decline of about 5.85%. Despite these overall losses, there were moments of recovery, including a one-week increase of 2.50%, indicating potential short-term bullish interest. The price has frequently encountered established resistance and support zones in recent trading sessions. This behavior illustrates a coin that has weathered minor setbacks while presenting opportunities for recovery during bullish phases. Current price levels range between $1.95 and $2.53, with support at $1.73 and resistance near $2.88. A secondary support may be developing around $1.15, while a further resistance level is positioned at about $3.45. The RSI, currently at 48.85, shows a balanced market where neither bulls nor bears dominate. This environment suggests trading strategies focused on breakouts or pullbacks at key levels. Traders might consider buying if the price finds stability around support, while those shorting could wait for resistance to hold firm, allowing for strategic entries and exits based on market sentiment. Stellar Under Pressure: Analyzing Recent Declines and Key Levels Over the past month, Stellar has shown a notable drop of around 9.68%, and the fall reaches nearly 39.12% over six months. The coin’s performance during these periods reflects a clear weakening trend, with its price adjusting downward amid market uncertainty. Price behavior has illustrated low positive momentum, supported by oscillator readings near neutral zones. This decline has made traders cautious, prompting a revaluation of short-term positions and strategies. Currently, Stellar trades within a defined range between about $0.2333 and $0.3158, indicating a market in consolidation yet under bearish pressure. Immediate support is near $0.2015, while a secondary floor exists at roughly $0.1189, suggesting buying interest at these levels. Resistance is set around $0.3666, with a further ceiling at about $0.4491. The relative strength index at 43.36 shows subdued momentum, with bears currently dominant. Traders might consider short-term trades, buying near support levels and aiming for profits at resistance, with caution advised due to the overall bearish sentiment. Conclusion SOL , XRP , and XLM continue to draw significant attention. These cryptocurrencies show potential for growth and investment opportunities. Their unique features and recent developments make them worth keeping an eye on. As the market evolves, tracking these coins may provide insights into broader trends.

This slowdown has prompted many to look for more dynamic investment opportunities. One name that’s catching everyone’s attention is Ruvi AI, an AI-powered blockchain token that is already showing tremendous growth potential. With a highly successful presale and real-world applications, Ruvi AI offers a promising alternative for those seeking high returns in a market filled with uncertainty. Solana’s struggles raise concerns Solana earned its reputation as a high-performance blockchain capable of processing thousands of transactions per second. However, technical outages and concerns over network reliability have dimmed its once-bright prospects. The platform has struggled to rebound fully, leaving many investors questioning its ability to deliver the exponential returns it achieved in the past. For those now seeking a more innovative and growth-focused investment, Ruvi AI presents itself as a compelling alternative with the potential for explosive returns. Ruvi AI’s presale success points to big gains Ruvi AI is making waves during its presale phase, with over $1.6 million raised and more than 140 million tokens sold so far.

This collaboration expands the token’s accessibility and ensures greater liquidity, making it easier for a global audience to buy and trade Ruvi AI. Such partnerships enhance a project’s legitimacy and often indicate a well-thought-out execution strategy. For Ruvi AI, this means increased confidence among both retail and institutional investors. VIP investment tiers offer outstanding incentives Ruvi AI goes the extra mile by offering a VIP investment tier system that significantly rewards early adopters. Here’s how the tiers break down: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000.

The first places chosen to host these future innovation centers are Salem Township and Falls Township. According to Amazon , this big investment will likely make at least 1,250 new high-skilled jobs possible. It is also expected to help thousands of other jobs in the supply chain for Amazon Web Services (AWS) data centers. David Zapolsky, Amazon’s chief global affairs and legal officer, said, “ Amazon’s multi-billion-dollar investment in Pennsylvania reinforces our dedication to advancing AI innovation while creating lasting economic opportunities in the state.” Amazon promises to spend $30 billion in two states in the US Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has praised the initiative, saying that Pennsylvania has secured the largest private sector investment in the history of the state. He added, “Pennsylvania is competing again—and I’m proud to announce that with Amazon’s commitment of at least $20 billion to build new state-of-the-art data center campuses across our Commonwealth.” The Pennsylvania announcement comes days after Amazon announced another investment of $10 billion in North Carolina. The investment also expands its data center infrastructure to support AI and cloud computing technologies. According to the company, the investment is expected to create at least 500 new high-skilled jobs while supporting thousands of other jobs in the AWS data center supply chain. North Carolina Governor Josh Stein said that AI is changing work and innovation, “I am pleased that North Carolina will stay at the forefront of all that’s ahead as we continue to attract top technology companies like Amazon.” In addition, the company has also made significant investments in renewable energy, including two solar and wind farms. Once fully operational, these projects are expected to generate enough carbon-free energy to power an estimated 76,316 US homes each year. AI return on investment vs expenditure Companies worldwide are rushing to add AI to their plans, but a new study shows that the technology isn’t quite working as expected. This year, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft intend to spend over $320 billion, up from $230 billion in 2025. A new report from IBM , which polled 2,000 CEOs around the world in the first quarter of 2025, says that only 25% of AI projects have achieved the expected return on investment (ROI) over the past three years. However, CEOs are still sure that AI is the future, even though the results haven’t been great so far. 85% of these leaders think that investments in scaled AI efficiency and cost savings will pay off by 2027, and 77% think that investments in scaled AI growth and expansion will also pay off. Over the past few years, corporate America has been vocal about its excitement about AI. This could be because it streamlines internal processes, boosts productivity, upskill current employees, or improves customer service. In practice, though, they are having trouble executing. A Gallup poll from late 2024 found that only 15% of US workers said that their companies had made a clear AI plan. While some experts agree that President Trump’s on-again, off-again tariff policies have caused economic instability, others think that this will help speed up AI adoption in business. Studies have shown that business leaders were eager to accept new technologies to stay in business during economic trouble, such as the Great Depression, the Great Recession, and COVID-19.

This latest MicroStrategy Bitcoin acquisition underscores the company’s unwavering commitment to its digital asset strategy and sends a clear signal to the market about its long-term conviction in BTC. What Was the Latest Strategy Bitcoin Purchase? According to reports circulating on social media, specifically from @cryptounfolded on X, Strategy acquired a substantial amount of Bitcoin between June 2 and June 8. The details of this recent Strategy Bitcoin purchase are as follows: Amount Acquired: 1,045 BTC Average Price Per BTC: Approximately $105,426 Total Value of Acquisition: $110.20 million This acquisition, executed over a period of roughly one week, demonstrates Strategy’s consistent approach to dollar-cost averaging into its Bitcoin position, even during periods of market volatility or price fluctuations. It’s a strategic decision that has defined the company’s financial policy since it first began acquiring Bitcoin in August 2020. Why Does Strategy Pursue This BTC Acquisition Strategy? Strategy’s decision to convert a significant portion of its treasury reserves into Bitcoin was spearheaded by its co-founder and executive chairman, Michael Saylor. The core rationale behind this aggressive BTC acquisition strategy is multi-faceted, primarily rooted in macroeconomic concerns and a belief in Bitcoin’s potential as a superior store of value. Key drivers for Strategy’s approach include: Inflation Hedge: Viewing Bitcoin as a hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies due to inflation and quantitative easing. Store of Value: Believing Bitcoin is a more reliable and secure store of value over the long term compared to traditional assets or cash reserves. Digital Gold Narrative: Adopting the perspective that Bitcoin is emerging as a digital equivalent to gold, with finite supply and increasing adoption. Balance Sheet Optimization: Seeking to maximize the long-term value of the company’s treasury by holding a non-sovereign, hard-capped asset. This philosophy has transformed MicroStrategy from a business intelligence software company into a de facto Bitcoin holding company, closely watched by investors worldwide. How Does This Latest Purchase Fit into Strategy’s Overall Corporate Bitcoin Strategy? This recent addition of 1,045 BTC is not an isolated event but rather a continuation of Strategy’s well-defined Corporate Bitcoin strategy . The company has systematically acquired Bitcoin over the past few years through various means, including using excess cash flow, issuing convertible senior notes, and selling stock. While the exact total holdings and average price are updated periodically by the company, this purchase adds to an already massive stack. Each acquisition, regardless of size, reinforces their commitment and increases their overall exposure to the asset class. It demonstrates that despite market cycles, the company remains dedicated to accumulating Bitcoin. What Does Strategy’s Ongoing Bitcoin Investment Signify? Strategy’s continuous Bitcoin investment is often seen as a significant bullish signal by the cryptocurrency community. As the largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoin, their actions are closely scrutinized. Their willingness to allocate substantial capital to BTC is interpreted in several ways: Validation for Bitcoin: It provides institutional validation for Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class suitable for corporate treasuries. Leadership Example: It sets an example that other corporations might eventually follow, potentially driving broader institutional adoption. Long-Term Conviction: It signals a strong belief in Bitcoin’s future price appreciation and its role in the global financial system. While not every company can, or should, adopt such an aggressive strategy, Strategy’s approach provides a real-world case study on integrating Bitcoin into a corporate balance sheet. Benefits and Challenges of Strategy’s Approach Strategy’s pioneering approach comes with distinct benefits and potential challenges: Benefits: Potential for Significant Upside: If Bitcoin’s price continues to appreciate over the long term, Strategy’s substantial holdings could significantly increase the company’s overall value, potentially benefiting shareholders. Increased Visibility and Brand Recognition: The company has gained immense global recognition and attention within the financial and crypto worlds due to its Bitcoin strategy. Inflation Protection: Provides a potential hedge against the erosion of purchasing power of fiat currency held in treasury. Challenges: Volatility Risk: Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset. Fluctuations in its price directly impact the reported value of Strategy’s holdings, which can affect financial reporting and investor sentiment. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, posing potential risks. Execution Risk: Managing such a large and concentrated position requires expertise and carries operational risks. Despite these challenges, Strategy has maintained its course, indicating a strong belief that the long-term benefits outweigh the risks. Actionable Insights from Strategy’s Moves While Strategy’s large-scale corporate strategy isn’t directly applicable to individual investors, their actions offer insights: Long-Term Perspective: Strategy’s approach is inherently long-term. They are not day traders but rather accumulators with a multi-year horizon. This reinforces the idea of holding Bitcoin for the long haul. Conviction in Bitcoin’s Fundamentals: Their continued buying reflects a deep conviction in Bitcoin’s core properties – scarcity, decentralization, and potential as a global reserve asset. Dollar-Cost Averaging: Their consistent purchases over time, regardless of price highs or lows, exemplify a form of dollar-cost averaging, a strategy many individual investors use to mitigate volatility risk. Observing corporate players like Strategy can help investors understand the growing institutional interest and the different strategies employed in gaining exposure to Bitcoin. In Conclusion: Strategy Doubles Down on Bitcoin Strategy’s latest acquisition of 1,045 BTC for over $110 million is another clear indication that the company remains fully committed to its Bitcoin-centric corporate strategy. As the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, their continued accumulation provides a significant vote of confidence in the digital asset’s future. This move reinforces their position, highlights their long-term conviction in Bitcoin as a store of value and inflation hedge, and keeps them at the forefront of corporate digital asset adoption. While the path may involve volatility, Strategy’s actions signal a belief that the long-term rewards of their Bitcoin investment strategy are substantial.

It has been a rough month for SOL as the token has booked losses of nearly 9% during this period as the crypto market has cooled off after its April-May rally. Investors’ interest in meme coins , an important segment of the Solana ecosystem, has also waned during this period as top tokens like Popcat (POPCAT) and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) entered a distribution stage after they doubled and, in some cases, tripled their prices. However, one trader believes that SOL could make a new all-time high soon based on an Elliott Wave analysis. Here we present the most Bullish scenario for #SOL Having completed $SOL wave 3 to ATH, we have possibly completed a drawn out correction wave 4. From there we have 5 waves higher to make the 1st wave of 5 waves within a larger final wave 5 higher to make another ATH before down pic.twitter.com/AufdJBvH63 — Matthew Dixon – Veteran Financial Trader (@mdtrade) June 7, 2025 Matthew Dixon, a trader whose X account has more than 20,000 followers, shared a bullish Solana price prediction that classifies the latest pullback as wave #4 of an Elliott Wave progression and it could anticipate a big move to a new price record as wave #5 unfolds. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) supports his analysis as the oscillator has made a U-turn after nearing oversold levels in the daily chart. Meanwhile, another trader on X who analyzed SOL’s bounce off a key support at $141 also favors a bullish Solana price prediction as long as the token clears the $152 level – which is exactly what seems to be taking place this morning alongside some strong volumes. Solana Price Prediction: Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern Supports Move to $225 Solana’s daily chart shows confirmation of an inverse head and shoulders pattern that has been forming since early March. The price broke out above the neckline at $148 with strong trading volumes. However, the token encountered strong selling pressure at $185 and retreated off those levels two times in just a few days. As a result, the market has now retested and bounced off the neckline again. This could be the decisive move that pushes SOL above the $185 resistance if positive momentum accelerates. The outcome of the United States negotiations with China on the trade front today could either make or break this pattern’s bullish bias depending on what happens. However, based on technical indications solely, the price action supports a bullish Solana price prediction with a target set at $225 based on the size of the inverse H&S’s head. Meanwhile, as Solana’s meme coin and DeFi ecosystem keep expanding, the network needs to strengthen its infrastructure to keep up with rising transaction volumes. Solaxy (SOLX) is a layer-2 scaling protocol that addresses the congestion issues that have plagued the Solana blockchain in the past and it is currently the hottest crypto presales of the year having raised more than $46 million in just a few months. Only One More Week to Invest in Solaxy (SOLX) at Its Discounted Presale Price Solaxy (SOLX) has entered the last week of its presale event with $46 million raised. This layer-2 scaling solution has already launched a testnet and a block explorer that allows investors to check the project’s performance in real time. The L2 bundles transactions offline in a side chain before sending them to the mainnet to alleviate the layer-1 burden. This is helpful during peak network usage times like January this year when TRUMP and MELANIA were launched. The demand for $SOLX will skyrocket once the protocol is adopted by top wallets and exchanges. Hence, this token offers significant upside potential to early buyers who invest at its discounted presale price of $0.00175. To buy $SOLX before the presale event ends, head to the Solaxy website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap SOL or USDT for this token or use a bank card to invest.

While the crypto scene reacted fast, Wall Street climbed more cautiously. The S&P 500 rose 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite went up by nearly 0.4%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 106 points. Trump officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, sat across from Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng at Lancaster House, the site where Draghi made his 2012 euro pledge. The meeting came days after Donald Trump and Xi Jinping had a long phone call . A month ago, both sides agreed to slash some tariffs for 90 days to get trade talks moving. Monday’s sit-down was the first follow-up. It was about figuring out if China would reopen rare earth mineral exports and whether the U.S. would ease restrictions right after that. Kevin Hassett, head of Trump’s National Economic Council, said on CNBC, “The purpose of the meeting today is to make sure that they’re serious … to literally get handshakes … and get this thing behind us.” He also said the U.S. expects that “immediately after the handshake, any export controls from the U.S. will be eased, and the rare earths will be released in volume.” Chip stocks jump while Apple falls after WWDC On the tech side, traders bet big on semiconductors. Qualcomm soared over 4% after confirming it was buying chipmaker Alphawave for $2.4 billion. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices and Texas Instruments each gained more than 4%. Nvidia also edged higher. Investors pushed these names up as they’re seen as major winners if U.S.-China tensions drop. Larry Tentarelli, chief technical strategist at Blue Chip Daily Trend Report, said , “Investors are taking bullish trades today on China large caps and U.S. semiconductor stocks, which are both beneficiaries of U.S./China trade talks.” Alibaba moved up 2%, adding to the trend of confidence in Chinese big names. But not everything climbed. Apple slipped 1.5% during its 2025 Worldwide Developers Conference, where it showed its first major iOS redesign in more than a decade. It wasn’t enough to pull in the bulls, who were focused on geopolitics and macro data instead. Back in London, Trump’s team wasn’t just chasing minerals. By bringing Howard Lutnick, who manages controls over tech exports, they signaled that Trump may reverse some of the blocks on U.S. tech sales to China. That includes everything from jet engine parts to advanced microchips. The message? If China plays ball on exports, Washington might loosen its grip on the tech leash. Looking ahead, traders are waiting on inflation figures. The consumer price index is due Wednesday, and the producer price index comes Thursday. Both are expected to show how current tariffs are impacting prices. Investors want clear numbers before placing any new bets. Markets also just wrapped up a strong two-week run. The S&P 500 closed above 6,000 on Friday for the first time since February 21, now sitting less than 3% from its record high. Richard Saperstein, chief investment officer at Treasury Partners, said, “With the S&P 500 closing above 6,000 for the first time since February, stocks are effectively looking through the current tariff uncertainty into a more stimulative economic climate.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",Bitcoin|BTC|China|United States,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-09 19:34:08

This results in ultra-fast confirmations, with blocks added roughly every second, making it one of the most responsive networks in the space. Another standout feature is GhostDAG, a protocol that maintains consensus even during periods of high network traffic. ChatGPT projects a price range of $3 to $10 by 2030. According to the model’s estimate, if Kaspa hits the upper target, an investment of $8,000 today could grow into $1 million. Render (RNDR) For the second pick, ChatGPT selected Render (RNDR), a project aiming to become the decentralized supercomputer for AI, VFX, and the metaverse. It offers a gateway into the rapidly growing worlds of artificial intelligence and 3D computing. ChatGPT noted that Render’s core strength lies in its decentralized GPU rendering network, which uses underused graphics processing power to handle high-performance visual workloads. As demand for AI computing and immersive digital experiences grows, ChatGPT noted that Render stands out thanks to its strong industry partnerships and increasing real-world adoption. With RNDR currently trading at $3.98, ChatGPT forecasts a price range between $100 and $300 by 2030. RNDR seven-day price chart.

Even a more conservative outcome of about $199 could still yield a million dollars from a $20,000 stake. While both tokens, like all cryptocurrencies, come with inherent risk, they are backed by solid technology, strong use cases, and promising roadmaps. These factors could act as growth catalysts over the next five years, potentially turning early believers into millionaires.

The controversial comment was made in response to a post by the World of Statistics that asked, “What is a silent killer that people don’t realize is slowly killing them?” To that, Keiser simply replied, XRP. Known for his unabashed and often polarizing takes, Keiser’s remark has reignited long-standing tensions between Bitcoin purists and XRP supporters. While the original post was likely meant to evoke reflections on health or societal issues, Keiser’s decision to weaponize it against XRP speaks volumes about the enduring ideological divide in the cryptocurrency space. XRP https://t.co/wec1D1Lwcy — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) June 8, 2025 Jose F Sanchez’s Painful XRP Confession The impact of Keiser’s jab was amplified by the emotional comment that followed from an X user identified as Jose F Sanchez. Sharing his regret, Sanchez wrote: “XRP made me lose approximately 30 million dollars. I had $8,000 available to invest at the time and was considering buying Solana at $0.54, XRP at $0.16, and Bitcoin at $3,800. Long short story, All inside in XRP and just like that, today Solana is $175, XRP (I don’t even care).” Sanchez’s story resonated with many in the crypto community, highlighting the frustration felt by retail investors who invested in XRP for the long haul, expecting returns similar to those of Solana, Ethereum, and meme coins like Shiba Inu or Dogecoin. While XRP has made gains since its lows, its price trajectory has lagged behind many of its peers, especially during the explosive bull cycles of 2021 and the more recent 2024–2025 rallies. Ripple’s Ongoing Legal Woes and Price Stagnation XRP’s underperformance is not without context. Since December 2020, Ripple Labs, the company closely associated with XRP, has been locked in a high-stakes legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the case continues to cast a shadow over investor sentiment. These developments have significantly affected XRP’s momentum. While Ripple continues to make strides in enterprise blockchain adoption, including central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilots and cross-border payment solutions, the token itself has not seen price appreciation reflective of these advancements. This disconnect fuels the argument from critics like Keiser, who view XRP as a stagnating asset weighed down by centralized control and legal entanglements. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Keiser’s History of Anti-Altcoin Sentiment Max Keiser’s disdain for altcoins, particularly XRP, is nothing new. As an early Bitcoin evangelist and host of The Keiser Report, he has long dismissed all non-Bitcoin digital assets as inferior or even dangerous. He refers to them as “centralized scams” and frequently criticizes their tokenomics, governance models, and lack of true decentralization. His criticism of XRP specifically centers on the coin’s pre-mined nature and Ripple’s significant holdings, which he believes violate the principles of decentralization that underpin Bitcoin. By calling XRP a “silent killer,” Keiser implies that it lulls investors into a false sense of security while quietly eroding their capital and opportunity cost, a point echoed in Sanchez’s regretful account. A Divisive Legacy Max Keiser’s “silent killer” remark may be seen as harsh hyperbole by some, but it encapsulates a broader narrative: the vast ideological rift within the crypto ecosystem. Bitcoin purists view XRP as a relic of the traditional financial system , marked by centralization, lack of transparency, and regulatory trade-offs, which Bitcoin was designed to challenge. Meanwhile, for XRP proponents, the asset is a practical solution to real-world financial inefficiencies, unfairly persecuted by both regulators and rivals. Whether XRP ultimately vindicates its long-term holders or confirms the suspicions of its detractors remains to be seen.

After hitting impressive highs, the leading digital asset experienced a notable pullback, leaving investors and analysts pondering the next move. What’s driving this volatility, and what does it mean for the broader crypto market ? Understanding the Recent Bitcoin Pullback According to the latest Bitfinex Alpha report, the weekly analysis from U.S.-based crypto exchange Bitfinex, Bitcoin has seen its price drop by over 10% from its recent all-time highs. This isn’t just random market noise; several significant factors appear to be converging to create this downward pressure. Key drivers identified by Bitfinex include: Strong Spot Demand: While seemingly counterintuitive, persistent underlying demand can sometimes lead to rapid price increases that become unsustainable in the short term, setting the stage for corrections. Long-Term Holder Profit-Taking: After significant price appreciation, long-term holders who have held Bitcoin for years often decide to sell a portion of their holdings to realize profits. This adds substantial sell pressure to the market. Macroeconomic Strain: The broader global economic environment, particularly in major economies like the U.S., plays an increasingly important role in crypto asset performance. Signs of economic weakening or policy shifts can influence investor sentiment and capital flows. The Impact of Liquidation Events One of the most dramatic aspects of the recent price drop was the scale of liquidations. Bitfinex highlighted that on a single day, June 5th, over $875 million in long positions were liquidated. This figure is substantial and underscores the leveraged nature of much of the trading activity in the crypto market . What is Liquidation? Liquidation occurs in margin or futures trading when a trader’s position is forcibly closed because they don’t have enough margin to cover potential losses. When a leveraged long position (betting on the price going up) faces a significant price drop, the exchange automatically sells off the position to prevent the account balance from falling below zero. Large-scale liquidations can create a cascading effect, pushing the price down further and triggering more liquidations, accelerating the decline. The $875 million figure indicates that a large number of traders were positioned for further price increases using leverage. When the price moved against them, these positions were wiped out, adding significant sell volume to the market and contributing to the speed and depth of the 10% pullback. What Does Bitfinex Analysis Say About Support Levels? Despite the increased sell pressure and the recent dip, the Bitfinex analysis points to critical levels where Bitcoin’s price might find support. Identifying these levels is crucial for traders and investors trying to gauge potential bottoms or re-entry points. According to the report, key support levels for BTC to watch are: $103,700 $97,100 $95,600 These levels represent potential price points where buying interest might increase, historically significant price areas, or technical indicators suggesting a floor. While support levels are not guaranteed, they serve as important markers for market participants. How Are Macroeconomic Factors Influencing Bitcoin? The connection between traditional finance and the crypto market is becoming undeniable, and macroeconomic factors are playing a larger role than ever. The Bitfinex report specifically mentions signs of weakening in the U.S. economy. Indicators of this potential weakening include: Slowing job growth Contraction in manufacturing activity Contraction in services activity Rising inflation pressures (despite efforts to curb it) A weakening economy can influence asset prices in several ways. It might lead central banks to consider interest rate cuts, which could be seen as positive for risk assets like Bitcoin. Conversely, economic uncertainty can lead investors to become more risk-averse, pulling capital out of volatile markets. The interplay of these factors creates a complex backdrop for the Bitcoin price . Growth and Adoption Continue Amidst Volatility It’s important to note that even as the market experiences volatility and faces macro headwinds, the underlying trend of crypto adoption continues globally. The Bitfinex report highlights positive developments that showcase the increasing integration of digital assets into the traditional financial system and corporate strategies. Examples cited in the report include: IG Group Offering Spot Crypto Trading: A major global financial services provider like IG Group expanding its offerings to include spot crypto trading signals growing institutional and retail demand and acceptance. Japan’s Metaplanet Raising Funds for Bitcoin Holdings: A Japanese company actively raising capital ($5.4 billion mentioned in the report, though this figure might require verification as it seems exceptionally high for a single raise focused on Bitcoin, perhaps a typo in the source or a cumulative figure/future plan) specifically to increase its Bitcoin holdings mirrors the strategy adopted by companies like MicroStrategy and indicates increasing corporate adoption of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. These examples demonstrate that despite short-term price fluctuations driven by profit-taking and liquidation events, the long-term thesis for crypto adoption and integration remains strong. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Current Market Given the current environment, what should market participants consider? Monitor Macro Data: Pay close attention to economic indicators, central bank statements, and inflation reports, as these are increasingly influencing the crypto market . Watch Key Support Levels: The levels identified by Bitfinex ($103,700, $97,100, $95,600) are important technical points. Observing how the price reacts around these levels can provide clues about potential future movements. Understand Liquidation Risks: For those using leverage, the recent events are a stark reminder of the risks involved. Excessive leverage can lead to rapid losses during pullbacks. Focus on Long-Term Trends: While short-term volatility is normal, the continued growth in adoption and infrastructure development supports the long-term potential of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market . Risk Management: Always employ sound risk management practices, including setting stop-losses and not investing more than you can afford to lose. Conclusion: A Crossroads Moment for Bitcoin Bitcoin’s recent 10% pullback, analyzed by Bitfinex, highlights the complex interplay of market dynamics. Driven by profit-taking, significant liquidation events, and mounting macroeconomic factors , the price action underscores the asset’s sensitivity to both internal market structure and the external economic climate. While challenges like economic uncertainty and volatility persist, the continued march of global crypto adoption, exemplified by institutional interest and corporate treasury strategies, paints a picture of long-term resilience. Investors are now watching key support levels closely, trying to determine if this pullback is a temporary correction or the start of a deeper trend. Navigating this period requires a clear understanding of the forces at play and a focus on robust risk management, recognizing that the Bitcoin price journey is influenced by a multitude of global forces.

45731594,https://cryptonews.com/?p=369370,1749498115,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/45731594.jpeg,Cardano Price Prediction: One Key Level Holds the Fate of the Next ADA Rally – $100 Possible?,https://cryptonews.com/news/cardano-price-prediction-one-key-level-holds-the-fate-of-the-next-ada-rally-100-possible/,"Cardano (ADA) has gone down by nearly 16% in the past month as the crypto rally faltered amid rising tensions between the United States and China on the trade front. Investors’ sentiment has also been souring lately as reflected by the Fear and Greed Index , whose value has dropped from a local peak of 76 (Greed) to 55 at the time of writing, meaning that investors have now adopted a more cautious approach in what is a relatively uncertain scenario. Cardano’s trading volumes in the past 24 hours have increased by nearly 36% and have pushed the price 1% higher during this period. A key metric called the Market Value to Realized Value indicates that profits have started to shift from short-term to long-term holders as a result of the latest recovery. This is typically seen as a bullish signal, as it encourages long-term investors to hold their assets, reducing overall selling pressure. Given this setup, a reasonable Cardano price prediction would center around the $0.66 level—an area that has acted as a key accumulation zone and one which ADA quickly reclaimed after its recent bearish breakout. Cardano Price Prediction: What Needs to Happen for ADA to Reach $1? Cardano had been forming a falling wedge since mid-May when this latest pullback started to unfold. ADA has encountered strong support at $0.66 as traders pulled a bear trap right after the price action broke below this area. This falling wedge was broken already but trading volumes in the daily chart are still not high enough to confirm a solid breakout. As the price action is tagging a key support level, if ADA’s climb accelerates at this point, this would confirm a bullish Cardano price prediction with a near-term target set at $1 based on the height of the wedge. A golden cross between the 9-day and 21-day EMA would confirm this positive outlook while momentum indicators seem to be on pace to send a buy signal. And if Cardano adoption continues to grow and real-world utility expands, ADA could be on a path to $100 in the years ahead—especially if the broader market enters a new era of mass crypto integration. As the crypto market continues its unexpected recovery in this uncertain environment, the best crypto presales of the year like SUBBD (SUBBD) will deliver the highest returns to early buyers who enter while they are still flying below most investors’ radars.

The post, written in English and accompanied by a Spanish-language statement, asserted that Paraguay was launching a $5 million Bitcoin-backed reserve fund and integrating the cryptocurrency into its national financial system. It featured what appeared to be an official government decree, using the national coat of arms and official-looking formatting. The now-deleted tweet immediately drew skepticism due to its promotional tone, formatting inconsistencies, and absence from any official Paraguayan government channels. No confirmation appeared on government websites or state-run media.

However, after rejecting from local resistance at $1.80, the focus now shifts to whether bulls can defend support for continuation—or risk a full retrace within a broader range. After a strong and impulsive rally, UMA ( UMA ) has caught the attention of traders with a 26.54% move from support. This rally originated from a technically significant zone and marked a bullish shift in short-term momentum. However, price has now encountered resistance at $1.80, and a rejection has already formed, leaving a wick that may signal early exhaustion. The question now becomes: can UMA sustain this bullish structure—or is this just a temporary bounce in a broader range-bound market? Key technical points Rejection at $1.80: Price met resistance and sold off, forming a rejection wick. Key Support Zone at $1.60–$1.40: This zone includes a flipped order block and the local value area high. Bullish Continuation Depends on Holding Support: If the zone holds, a move toward $2.55 becomes more probable. UMAUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView The recent rally originated from a well-defined demand zone, supported by strong confluence—previous structure support, high-volume interest, and a flipped order block. This move marked a short-term bullish shift, but the price stalled at $1.80, a historically significant resistance level. A rejection wick formed at this level, suggesting profit-taking and early signs of bearish absorption. Since then, UMA has pulled back into the $1.60–$1.40 region, which now becomes a critical zone for the next directional move.

In addition, the value area high is also situated here, giving extra weight to this zone. If price remains above this area and begins forming higher lows, bulls could look to target $2.55 as the next significant resistance. However, failure to hold this support would invalidate the bullish thesis. A breakdown below $1.40 would likely lead to a full rotation back to the origin of the pump, indicating that UMA is still trading within a broader range defined by daily and monthly levels. In this case, the recent rally would be classified more as a deviation within a sideways structure rather than a breakout. What to expect in the coming price action All eyes are now on the $1.60–$1.40 support. If UMA can hold this zone, we could see continuation toward $2.55. If it breaks, expect a pullback to retest the lows of the range and re-enter accumulation.

According to a post on X , this update brings several new features that make it easier and more enjoyable for new and experienced crypto users. A key part of this update is the introduction of Precision Pools, a feature that changes how users earn rewards from liquidity. Shiba Inu DeFi Toolkit Brings Lots of Benefits With Precision Pools, users can customize the price ranges for their liquidity contributions. This makes them manage their risk effectively and earn more. Instead of spreading liquidity across a wide range, which can be inefficient, Precision Pools also enables users to focus on areas where they expect the most trading activity. Notably, the updated SHIB DeFi platform is user-friendly and easy to navigate, making it simple to earn income by providing liquidity. Participants can earn rewards, including a portion of trading fees, token rewards, and commissions. It is also worth noting that these rewards grow over time without effort. Another integral part of the upgrade is the new real-time token burn mechanism. As the number of tokens decreases, this may create scarcity, potentially increasing the token’s value over time. This strategy benefits holders and the wider community in the long run. Meanwhile, this upgrade reflects Shiba Inu’s goal of becoming a dynamic DeFi platform. Shiba Inu’s 2025 Price Target is $0.01 Recall that analysts have set a bold target of $0.01 for the Shiba Inu price in 2025. SHIB remains one of the strongest meme coins in the market, with a dedicated community and a growing ecosystem. To reach the targeted price, Shiba Inu needs mass adoption, token burns, and continued development of its DeFi ecosystem to fuel the surge. As of the time of writing, the Shiba Inu coin retails around $0.00001258, recording a 4% gain in the past 24 hours. Last month, it registered a monthly peak of $0.000017, suggesting the start of a market shift. Shiba Inu: The Hype Machine Launched in 2020, Shiba Inu was created as an experiment in decentralized community building. Dubbed the “Dogecoin Killer,” it quickly garnered attention and built a massive following. The Shiba Inu community, affectionately known as the “Shib Army,” rallied, driving the coin’s popularity and value to astronomical heights. Furthermore, Shiba Inu’s sense of purpose has helped solidify its standing in the crypto world, showing that meme coins can do more than just provide entertainment; they can also positively impact. Shiba Inu maintains a loyal user base as the market evolves, although it faces competition from other memecoins.

These inflows bring Ethereum’s seven-week total to US$1.5 billion, now accounting for 10.5% of total assets under management (AuM)—a level not seen since the U.S. elections in November 2024. “This represents the strongest run of inflows into Ethereum since last year’s U.S. election, signaling renewed investor confidence in the network’s long-term value,” said James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares. Bitcoin Sees Second Week of Outflows While Ethereum gained ground, Bitcoin (BTC) registered its second consecutive week of outflows, totaling US$56.5 million. Short-Bitcoin investment products also posted a second week of minor outflows, further suggesting that sentiment around Bitcoin remains cautious in the face of macroeconomic uncertainty. “Policy direction from the Fed continues to create hesitancy,” Butterfill noted. “Many investors are in wait-and-see mode ahead of inflation signals and rate decisions.” Despite this, the broader regional breakdown shows robust U.S. interest, with US$175 million of the total inflows coming from the U.S. Other regions contributing to the inflows include Germany (US$47.8M), Switzerland (US$15.7M), Canada (US$9.8M), and Australia (US$6.5M). Altcoins Remain Subdued as Focus Shifts to Majors Activity in altcoins remained relatively muted. Sui attracted US$1.1 million in minor inflows, while XRP experienced a third consecutive week of outflows, totaling US$6.6 million. Meanwhile, Hong Kong and Brazil were the only regions to see net outflows, with Hong Kong reversing recent record inflows with US$14.6 million in redemptions. As markets await more definitive direction from central banks, especially the U.S. Federal Reserve, the digital asset space appears to be consolidating. In the words of Butterfill, “The inflow slowdown reflects a cautious optimism—the capital is there, but conviction hinges on macro clarity.” The post Crypto Product Inflows Hit $224M, Momentum Slows Amid Fed Policy Uncertainty: CoinShares appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|CoinShares|ETFs|Federal Reserve,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-06-09 19:48:01

The company announced its first open market BitMine Bitcoin purchase , acquiring 100 BTC. BitMine Bitcoin Purchase: A New Chapter? According to a GlobeNewswire press release, BitMine confirmed its acquisition of 100 Bitcoin. What makes this particular purchase noteworthy is that it represents the company’s first direct acquisition of BTC from the open market. Furthermore, the funds used for this significant BitMine Bitcoin purchase were sourced from the proceeds of a recent stock offering, highlighting a deliberate capital allocation decision rather than simply holding mined Bitcoin. This initial purchase appears to be just the beginning, as BitMine stated its intention to expand its Bitcoin treasury holdings. This commitment suggests a longer-term vision for incorporating Bitcoin directly onto the company’s balance sheet. Why a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy? Increasingly, companies, especially those operating within or closely aligned with the digital asset ecosystem, are adopting a Bitcoin treasury strategy . This involves holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset alongside traditional fiat currency reserves. The rationale behind such a strategy often includes: Potential Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin is seen by some as a potential store of value that can act as a hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies over time. Upside Participation: Holding Bitcoin allows companies to directly benefit from potential price appreciation in the asset class. Signaling Confidence: For crypto-native companies, holding Bitcoin signals strong belief in the future and viability of the asset and the underlying technology. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset (in theory) to the balance sheet can provide diversification benefits. BitMine’s move indicates their embrace of this evolving corporate finance trend. Benefits for a Bitcoin Mining Company For a Bitcoin mining company like BitMine, holding BTC offers unique and compelling benefits that go beyond those for a typical corporation: Alignment of Interests: Directly aligns the company’s financial performance and balance sheet strength with the asset it produces and the network it helps secure. The company wins when Bitcoin’s value increases, reinforcing its core business model. Enhanced Balance Sheet: A growing Bitcoin treasury can significantly enhance the company’s balance sheet value, potentially improving financial ratios and investor perception. Operational Flexibility: While the purchased BTC wasn’t mined, a treasury allows for strategic decisions on when to sell mined BTC versus treasury BTC based on market conditions, operational needs, and growth plans. Industry Leadership: Joining the ranks of public companies with significant Bitcoin holdings can position the company as a leader in adopting forward-thinking treasury management practices within the sector. What Does This Mean for BMNR Stock and Investors? The decision to fund the BitMine Bitcoin purchase through a stock offering and commit to expanding holdings could have several implications for BMNR stock and its investors. For investors bullish on Bitcoin and the company’s long-term prospects, this move might be viewed positively. It signals management’s confidence in Bitcoin’s future value and aligns the company more closely with the performance of the digital asset itself. As BitMine accumulates more Bitcoin on its balance sheet, the performance of BMNR stock may become increasingly correlated with Bitcoin’s price movements, in addition to factors affecting its mining operations (like hash rate, energy costs, and mining difficulty). Investors will likely watch future treasury updates closely as a key metric alongside operational reports. The Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings BitMine joins a growing, albeit still relatively small, list of public and private companies accumulating substantial Corporate Bitcoin holdings . Pioneers like MicroStrategy have championed this approach, demonstrating that it is feasible for publicly traded entities to integrate Bitcoin into their financial strategy. This trend reflects increasing institutional acceptance, evolving accounting standards, and a strategic response to the macroeconomic environment. BitMine’s specific action – using capital raised via equity to buy Bitcoin on the open market – is a clear demonstration of a deliberate strategic choice to increase exposure to the asset beyond just the Bitcoin they mine. Understanding this broader movement of Corporate Bitcoin holdings is crucial for anyone following the intersection of traditional finance and the cryptocurrency market. Challenges and Considerations While the strategic benefits are clear, maintaining significant Corporate Bitcoin holdings is not without challenges. The primary challenge is Bitcoin’s price volatility, which can lead to significant fluctuations in the reported value of the treasury holdings on the balance sheet. Companies must also navigate complex accounting rules for digital assets, ensure robust security protocols to protect their private keys, and manage the liquidity of these holdings. Summary BitMine Immersion Technologies’ first open market BitMine Bitcoin purchase of 100 BTC, funded by a recent stock offering, marks a significant strategic pivot. It signals the company’s firm commitment to building and expanding its Bitcoin treasury strategy . By doing so, BitMine aligns itself with the increasing trend of Corporate Bitcoin holdings among public entities, including fellow Bitcoin mining company peers. This move has potential positive implications for BMNR stock , positioning the company to directly benefit from future Bitcoin price appreciation while adding a new dimension to its corporate value proposition. As the company proceeds with its plans to acquire more Bitcoin, it will be important to monitor how this strategy impacts its financial performance and standing within the competitive Bitcoin mining landscape.

45732148,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=743572,1749498659,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45732148.jpeg,Pump.fun plans to raise $1 billion through a token sale,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pump-fun-token-offering-liquidity-concerns/,"Pump.fun is currently in the early stages of a token offering after it reportedly decided to raise $1 billion toward making the effort a success. The development has many worried as a token sale of such magnitude risks drawing demand away from the coins launched on the platform. The platform, which is a revenue and activity machine on the Solana blockchain, is reportedly still in the early stages of the token offering, according to anonymous sources that spoke to Bloomberg. The offering would rank among the largest ever in crypto Details of the sale are not yet clear. However, the offering is being touted as one of the largest in crypto. The last major token sale was the Trump memecoin debut, which blew through the markets in January and generated billions of dollars in trading volume within a few days. It is no longer a secret that the memecoin market is an attention economy, and where attention goes, money follows. The increased trading volume of the Trump meme was brief, but it had a telling effect on the broader memecoin ecosystem, which witnessed a selloff as speculators sold off their other crypto assets to buy the President’s official token. Analysts are worried the same thing could happen, but on a much larger scale, which would strain the already volatile memecoin ecosystem, where less than 0.002% are able to sustain a market cap above $1 million. Ryan Watkins, co-founder of crypto investment fund Syncracy Capital, said : “The raise will take place over the course of a month. And I think during that month, any asset in the Solana ecosystem is vulnerable to being sold to fund that purchase.” Some market participants have also questioned the relatively high valuation of Pump.fun because of the token sale, which will be at a $4 billion fully diluted valuation, or FDV. “I would consider investing at $50 million FDV,” said Christine Fang, managing partner at Hong Kong-based crypto hedge fund PSE Trading. “Not sure if the $4 billion valuation is justified, especially with the lack of liquidity overall in altcoins.” An Airdrop could follow the token offering There are mixed opinions regarding the token offering, with some users on X suggesting the raise might be a strategic move to capitalize on hype, and others viewing it as a sign of diminishing liquidity in the crypto market. While the pessimists are accusing the platform of prioritizing insider gains over decentralization, the optimists argue that the sale could attract new capital from investors without memecoin exposure, which could potentially stabilize the market. This brings us to the topic of airdrops because some believe the offering will have to be paired with similar user incentives to stave off talks of insider gains. They are not far off point as talks of an airdrop have circulated for months now, despite repeated attempts to dispel them by Pump.fun executives. Also, about seven months ago, Pump.fun’s co-founder, @sapijiju, confirmed plans for a $PUMP token airdrop during a Twitter Spaces on October 19, 2024, boasting that it would be “a lot more lucrative than anyone else in the space.” Multiple sources have also reported that approximately 10% of the $PUMP token supply is earmarked for a community airdrop, potentially worth $400 million at a $4 billion fully diluted valuation. So, the likelihood of an airdrop happening is high, but the airdrop will be explicitly reserved for the early platform users, including those active on PumpSwap.

The proposal recommends keeping personal data off-chain and using privacy-preserving technologies to reduce exposure across Ethereum’s modular architecture. A new role classification framework would assign GDPR controller status only to front-end actors like wallets and dApps. Ethereum community member Eugenio Reggianini (“EugeRe”) has outlined a set of privacy and data management practices to help align Ethereum’s architecture with European Union data protection rules. The proposal was published on June 9 as part of the European Blockchain Association’s response to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) consultations. It recommends assigning data controller status to front-end actors, such as wallets and dApps, while lower-layer infrastructure should only process encrypted or anonymized data. Ethereum Roles Reclassified Under GDPR According to the proposal, personal data should be kept off-chain, with blockchain nodes relaying only references or proofs rather than identifiable information. To minimize exposure across the protocol, the proposal references a number of privacy-enhancing techniques. These include zk-SNARK execution, proposer-builder separation, data availability sampling, and homomorphic encryption. Reggianini suggests that recent developments like proto-danksharding could help enforce data minimization through temporary storage and automatic pruning. The document also proposes a new classification for blockchain participants under GDPR. Wallet providers and dApp developers would retain controller status, while mempool relays, validators, and data availability nodes would be treated as processors or considered out of scope if they handle only non-identifiable fragments. The proposal calls for Ethereum’s modular structure to serve as a framework for compliance, reducing exposure by design. Role separation within the execution, consensus, and data availability layers is emphasized as a strategy to manage risk while maintaining Ethereum’s permissionless nature. Announcing the Ethereum Foundation Treasury Policy https://t.co/bU566m1zX5 — Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) June 4, 2025 EU Rules Prompt Restructuring and Retreat The summary concludes that GDPR compliance for Ethereum is technically achievable if personal data remains at the application level and never propagates to base-layer infrastructure. This, it argues, would allow compliance with existing law without imposing central controls on the network. Several crypto projects have restructured to comply with GDPR by shifting identity checks and data storage off-chain. Others, lacking technical capacity or legal clarity, have withdrawn from the European Union altogether. The law’s strict definition of controllership has drawn criticism for applying centralized assumptions to decentralized networks. Projects like Worldcoin have faced bans over biometric data use, stressing the tension between data rights and open protocols. Reggianini’s proposal adds to growing calls for a more nuanced regulatory approach, one that recognizes the technical roles of blockchain participants rather than treating all nodes as data controllers. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why is the GDPR difficult for public blockchains like Ethereum? The GDPR was written for centralized systems with clear data controllers. Public blockchains, by contrast, distribute data processing across thousands of nodes, making it unclear who is responsible for compliance. What are the risks of non-compliance with GDPR in blockchain systems? Entities processing personal data without a legal basis could face heavy fines, enforcement actions, or be forced to exit the EU market altogether. Could GDPR frameworks eventually change to accommodate decentralized tech? Some policymakers and advocacy groups are calling for legal updates that better distinguish between active controllers and passive processors in blockchain networks, but no official changes have been made yet.

In its latest Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report , CoinShares finds that last week’s institutional crypto inflows, while positive, have fallen significantly in the last two weeks, perhaps due to uncertainty on US monetary policy. “Digital asset investment products saw US$224m in inflows last week, extending this 7-week streak to US$11bn. However, there has been a noticeable deceleration amid uncertainty over monetary policy, with investors adopting a wait-and-see stance ahead of further signals from the US Federal Reserve on inflation.” Source: CoinShares Regionally, the US led internationally with $175 million in inflows. Germany, Switzerland, Canada and Australia followed with $47.8 million, $15.7 million, $9.8 million and $6.5 million in inflows, respectively. “Minor outflows were seen in Brazil (US$9.2m) and Hong Kong (US$14.6m), with the latter marking an end to record inflows.” Leading smart contract platform, Ethereum ( ETH ), has been on a seven-week inflow streak, totaling $1.5 billion, with $296 million in inflows last week. This marks the strongest inflow run for ETH products since the US Election. Following last week’s trend, Bitcoin ( BTC ) saw its second consecutive week of outflows, resulting in $56.5 million in losses. “Altcoins were subdued.

This list covers four coins that meet those criteria: BlockDAG, Monero (XMR), Kaspa (KAS), and Filecoin (FIL). Each has different mechanics and risk levels, but all offer upside potential based on current price levels, upgrades, or adoption metrics. Whether you’re looking for breakout presale ROI or a privacy coin bouncing off a big run, these are some of the strongest names to track now. Here’s how they stack up in the high ROI crypto conversation for 2025. 1. BlockDAG – 2,520% ROI with Go-Live Days Away BlockDAG is currently in Batch 28 of its presale, selling coins at a special rate of $0.0018 with a return of 2,520% from Batch 1 to regular batch 28 price of $0.0262. It’s already raised over $291 million, sold more than 22 billion BDAG, and gained over 1.5 million users on its X1 miner app. With the GO LIVE reveal coming on June 13, this coin is heading into a major momentum phase. The event is expected to confirm listings on 20 top-tier exchanges and announce a partnership with a major NBA franchise. Add that to its current backing from Inter Milan and UFC star Alex Pereira, and BlockDAG has lined up real cultural and tech visibility even before launch. The testnet is live with over 100 deployed dApps and includes mobile and ASIC mining, no-code token creation tools, and a developer-friendly ecosystem. BlockDAG is already being used, not just promised. It runs a hybrid proof-of-work and DAG system for fast confirmations and scalability. What separates BDAG is that everything is happening now, not years from now. Its special presale price ends June 13, making this the final window to buy in before price surges. No other high ROI crypto has combined adoption, user tools, and presale growth at this scale so far in 2025. 2. Monero (XMR) – Privacy Rebound Could Reach $580 Monero is showing serious signs of strength this quarter. After rallying nearly 150% in Q2, XMR hit a local high near $420 and is now trading between $323 and $328. That kind of pullback is attracting attention, especially since analysts have highlighted a path to $580 in the near term. Technicals show no bearish divergence despite an RSI nearing oversold territory. That’s a bullish setup, and momentum could resume fast, especially with MoneroKon 2025 happening June 20–22 in Prague. XMR also saw a 6.85% gain on June 2, with on-chain activity up 22%, suggesting demand for privacy is growing again. It’s worth noting that Monero continues to face pressure from regulators, especially in Europe, but its community and use cases remain strong. Cuprate node upgrades have shortened sync times to just 20 hours. With institutional privacy infrastructure still limited and Monero dominating its niche, it holds a real shot at reclaiming $420 and possibly pushing further. It’s a proven coin that keeps bouncing back, making it one of the more established picks on this high ROI crypto list. 3. Kaspa (KAS) – Double-Bottom Reversal or Summer Dip? Kaspa is currently trading around $0.088, but analysts are split on whether that’s a bottom or the setup for another leg down. Some short-term forecasts expect a slide toward $0.068 by June 12. But if it holds support near $0.0797 and breaks the $0.092 neckline with volume, the chart signals a reversal that could push it 20–30% higher fast. This double-bottom pattern is what’s attracting close attention from traders right now. Zooming out, long-term price predictions look much better. Analysts are pointing to year-end targets of $0.11–$0.125, and some models even suggest a long shot $1.41 by 2030. It’s a volatile coin, its 30-day volatility is still above 11%, but that’s also where opportunities sit. KAS is not for passive holding, but for those who know how to watch patterns and confirm trends, it can be an active entry into the high ROI crypto zone. Key to watch: will this June drop form a real floor or break down further? 4. Filecoin (FIL) – Storage Bridge Upgrades and Slow Climb Ahead Filecoin is down slightly to around $2.46 after dropping 5% on June 5. That pushed it below its $2.54 support, but price forecasts from CoinCodex and Changelly still expect it to hover in the $2.45–2.50 range through June. Short-term upside is limited, but the ecosystem is pushing forward with important network upgrades and new features. A new cross-chain data bridge with Avalanche and an upgrade known as HyperDrive are aimed at boosting onboarding speed 10–25 times. The recent Filecoin Dev Summit in Toronto showcased those efforts, including governance updates and a focus on real-world adoption of decentralized storage. Year-end targets suggest a slow move to $2.58–$2.66, with stronger growth expected into 2026. This one isn’t flashing big gains right now, but for long-term buyers looking for infrastructure plays, FIL holds value. It may not be the flashiest on the high ROI crypto radar, but if tech upgrades hit and storage demand builds, the upside could gradually widen. Summing Up There’s no shortage of altcoins claiming to offer upside in 2025, but very few are delivering actual returns or making measurable progress. Monero is riding the comeback of privacy tech with real numbers backing it. Kaspa is in the middle of a possible reversal that could spark double-digit gains, and Filecoin is laying quiet groundwork with smart ecosystem upgrades. But BlockDAG is hitting every mark at once: tech, user growth, listings, and cultural visibility. It’s got over 1.5 million miners, $291 million raised, and a limited-time price of $0.0018 that’s ending on June 13. That’s why it’s leading the pack in the high ROI crypto category right now, and why many are treating this moment as the last chance to get in before the public markets take over.

In a recent leak posted on Instagram, Wall Street newsletter Exec Sum reports that the financial services titan is telling new recruits they’ll be let go if they accept another job during the first 18 months of working for the company. The memo from the bank appears to ask new recruits not to accept a position with another company before or within one and a half years of joining JPM in a potential crackdown on “talent poaching.” “As a reminder, job searching outside JPMorganChase must be done on your own time and should not interfere with your responsibilities. Avoiding potential conflicts of interest is crucial to maintaining the trust and confidence our clients place in us, so we have updated our policy regarding Investment Banking Analysts accepting future-dated job offers. Therefore, if you accept a position with another company before joining us or within your first 18 months, you will be provided notice and your employment with the firm will end.” According to a recent report from Fortune, JPMorgan’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said he views the activity as “unethical” as it can lead to conflicts of interest.

Binance Alpha, a dedicated corner within the broader Binance ecosystem designed to showcase promising early-stage crypto projects, has just added Seraph (SERAPH) to its platform. This move, recently announced via Binance’s official X account, shines a spotlight on Seraph, bringing it to the attention of a vast audience of crypto enthusiasts and potential early adopters. What is Binance Alpha and Why Does it Matter? Think of Binance Alpha as a curated gallery for emerging talent in the crypto world. It’s not the main trading floor (that’s the Binance Exchange), but rather a platform accessible via the Binance Wallet that aims to give visibility to projects that are still in their relatively nascent stages. Its primary goal is to help users discover and learn about these projects based on specific criteria. The selection process for inclusion on Binance Alpha isn’t arbitrary. According to Binance, projects are chosen based on factors like strong community engagement and alignment with current market trends. This suggests that Seraph has demonstrated a notable level of interest and activity within its community, catching the eye of the Binance Alpha team. For projects, being featured on Binance Alpha offers significant benefits: Increased Visibility: Access to millions of Binance Wallet users. Potential Early Adoption: Exposure to users interested in exploring new opportunities. Credibility Signal: While not a guarantee of future success, inclusion by Binance Alpha can signal potential interest from a major industry player. Introducing Seraph Crypto : What We Know The addition of Seraph crypto to Binance Alpha naturally sparks curiosity: what exactly is Seraph? Based on publicly available information, Seraph is often described as an action RPG built on blockchain technology. It aims to integrate blockchain elements, potentially including NFTs for in-game assets, into a traditional gaming experience. The focus on community engagement mentioned in the Binance Alpha selection criteria suggests that the Seraph crypto project has been actively building and interacting with its user base. This is a crucial factor for any emerging project, as a strong community can drive adoption, provide valuable feedback, and contribute to the ecosystem’s growth. While details available on Binance Alpha might be limited to project basics, this inclusion encourages interested users to delve deeper into the Seraph crypto ecosystem, exploring its whitepaper, team, technology, and community channels to understand its vision and potential. Navigating the World of Early Stage Crypto Projects The inclusion of Seraph on Binance Alpha highlights the platform’s role in showcasing early stage crypto projects . Investing or engaging with projects at this stage comes with both exciting opportunities and significant risks. These projects are often still under development, their technology unproven at scale, and their market adoption uncertain. Opportunities associated with early stage crypto projects : Potential for high growth if the project succeeds. Opportunity to be part of a project’s community from the ground floor. Access to tokens or assets at potentially lower valuations compared to established projects. Challenges and risks of early stage crypto projects : High volatility and price uncertainty. Risk of project failure or abandonment. Less liquidity compared to established assets. Potential for scams or poorly executed projects. Binance Alpha serves as a discovery tool, but it’s paramount that users conduct their own thorough research (DYOR – Do Your Own Research) before engaging with any early stage crypto projects featured on the platform or elsewhere. Understanding Inclusion vs. a Full Binance Listing It’s absolutely critical to understand the distinction between being featured on Binance Alpha and achieving a full Binance listing on the main exchange platform. Binance explicitly states that inclusion on Binance Alpha does not guarantee a future listing on Binance Exchange. A full Binance listing is a rigorous process with stringent criteria that projects must meet, including liquidity, trading volume, regulatory compliance, technology stability, and continued community support. While being on Binance Alpha might provide a project like Seraph with valuable exposure and potentially help it build some of these necessary factors, it is merely a stepping stone or a showcase, not an approval for trading on one of the world’s largest exchanges. Users should manage their expectations accordingly. Discovering Seraph via Binance Alpha is an opportunity to learn about a project, but it should not be interpreted as a signal that SERAPH tokens will soon be available for trading on Binance Exchange. Any potential Binance listing would be a separate, future announcement contingent on Seraph meeting Binance’s listing standards at that time. Staying Updated with the Latest Crypto News Keeping informed is key in the fast-paced world of digital assets. Following reliable sources for crypto news , like official announcements from platforms such as Binance and direct communications from projects like Seraph, is essential for anyone interested in this space. Binance Alpha’s addition of Seraph is a piece of crypto news that highlights the ongoing activity in the early-stage project landscape. Platforms like Binance Alpha provide a structured way to explore these developments, but complementing this with broader market analysis and specific project deep dives is always recommended. Where to find relevant crypto news and information: Official exchange announcements (like Binance’s X feed). Project whitepapers and official websites. Reputable crypto news outlets. Project community channels (Discord, Telegram – use caution against scams). Blockchain explorers to track on-chain activity. Staying proactive in seeking out and verifying crypto news helps you make more informed decisions. Conclusion: Exploring Seraph on Binance Alpha The addition of Seraph (SERAPH) to Binance Alpha offers an exciting opportunity for users to discover an early-stage blockchain project. Binance Alpha serves as a valuable platform for visibility, showcasing projects based on community interest and market relevance. While this inclusion brings Seraph to a wider audience, it is crucial to remember that it does not guarantee a future listing on the main Binance Exchange. As with all early-stage ventures, engaging with Seraph or similar projects requires careful consideration and thorough personal research into their fundamentals, risks, and potential. Binance Alpha provides the introduction; your own due diligence should guide your next steps in the dynamic world of crypto.

On Polymarket alone, bettors have staked more than half a million dollars on whether Donald Trump will face impeachment in 2025, while smaller markets are tracking odds on everything from Elon Musk unfollowing the President on X to the pair patching things up before July. The scale and granularity of these wagers reveal how closely crypto natives are treating the feud as both entertainment and a proxy for political risk. Musk and Trump’s feud is now fueling a frenzy on prediction markets. • $600K+ in bets on Polymarket. • 30% odds they reconcile by July. • 9% chance Musk runs for president in 2025. — Bitcoin.com News (@BTCTN) June 8, 2025 Musk’s musings about launching a centrist party nudged odds of him actually doing so to roughly one in five, for example, while a fleeting rumor of a Trump-Musk phone call sent reconciliation contracts surging before plummeting when Trump publicly dismissed the idea. Even the more outlandish contracts—such as a 4% chance that Trump could somehow land Musk behind bars—show traders’ appetite for turning every twist into a tradable event. Polymarket Bets on Musk’s Next Click Traders tracking the Trump-Musk feud have zeroed in on one symbolic act: whether Elon Musk will remove Donald Trump from his X-following list. The contract asking if Musk will unfollow the President before July 2025 hovered between 8% and 12% implied probability in recent sessions, reflecting guarded skepticism rather than outright dismissal of the move. Source: Polymarket / Will Elon Musk unfollow Donald Trump before July A short-term variant tied to an early June deadline drew about US$57,000 in volume—modest by Polymarket standards yet brisk for a pure etiquette play. Order-book data shows bursts of activity after each public jab: when Trump labeled Musk “the man who has lost his mind,” “Yes” shares briefly ticked up before sellers moved in, restoring the status quo. The market’s seesaw illustrates how quickly headlines translate into price swings on decentralized exchanges. Key takeaways at a glance: Implied odds: 8%–12% in recent sessions. Liquidity spikes : Align with new insults or supportive reposts on X. Average trade size: Under US$100, pointing to heavy retail participation. Sentiment split: Bulls frame an unfollow as a likely next-step escalation; bears note Musk’s penchant for monitoring rivals rather than muting them. Account Suspension Odds Plummet on X If an unfollow seems plausible, outright de-platforming does not. A separate contract asking whether Trump’s X account will be suspended by next Friday opened at a high of 3.9% but collapsed to ~1% within two trading days. Source: Polymarket / Will @realDonaldTrump be suspended by Friday? The sharp decline followed commentary from Musk reaffirming his free-speech stance and analysts pointing out the immense political cost of banning a sitting president. Liquidity on this market has thinned as the price approached its floor, indicating consensus that a suspension is near-impossible under current circumstances. Key points: Probability crash: 3.9% → ~1% in 48 hours. Low ongoing volume : The contract is now largely dormant. Driving factor: Musk’s public commitment to minimal content policing. Market interpretation: Bettors view a ban as “nuclear,” thus relegating it to tail-risk status. Together, these social-media flashpoints underline how the feud’s smallest gestures—an unfollow, a ban button left untouched—become tradable indicators, shaping real-time odds in the wider crypto prediction ecosystem. Reconciliation Odds Sway With Every Rumor The prospect of Donald Trump and Elon Musk burying the hatchet remains one of the most closely watched subplots of the Trump-Musk feud. On Polymarket, the “public reconciliation before July” contract has settled into a 24% range, but that figure has whipsawed with each new headline. When Politico floated the possibility of a private call between the two, “Yes” bids spiked; mere hours later, Trump’s televised remark that Musk had “lost his mind” sent the contract tumbling on a rush of “No” orders. A parallel, shorter-tenor wager on Kalshi mirrored the drama, diving from 36% to 14% on Friday.. Key momentum shifts: Event catalyst: Rumored phone call → brief rush of “Yes” buying. Trump rebuttal: Sharp verbal jab → immediate sell-off in reconciliation odds. Liquidity pattern: Trade volume peaks within 30 minutes of each news break. Current sentiment: Roughly two-thirds of traders expect continued acrimony through June. Apology and Insult Markets Paint a Bleak Picture If reconciliation seems uncertain, outright contrition appears fantastical. The Polymarket line on Trump apologizing to Musk by June 9 is pinned near 1%, a level that traders treat as functionally impossible. Source: Polymarket / Will Trump apologize to Elon by Monday? Conversely, the market questioning whether Trump would publicly insult Musk (a contract opened at 12%) rocketed to the maximum price once the “lost his mind” quote hit cable news, locking in a market-implied near-certainty of insult. Additional indicators from feud-focused contracts: Phone-call likelihood: 57% by year-end, only 14% this month. Meeting odds: Similar curve—low near-term, majority chance by December. Average ticket size: Under US$150, suggesting broad retail dabbling rather than whale dominance. Trader narrative: Ego clashes dominate discussion boards, with users betting that “spectacle sells better than a handshake.” Taken together, apology and insult pricing confirm that bettors view cordiality as a long shot while expecting more rhetorical fireworks before any détente takes shape. Musk’s Third-Party Gambit Gains Speculative Traction Barely a day after Elon Musk floated the idea of a centrist political party, posting an X poll that drew more than five million votes with roughly 80% in favor, prediction markets repriced the possibility. On Polymarket, the contract asking whether Musk will form a new U.S. party by December 2025 now implies a 17% chance. A shorter window ending in June 2025 carries just 5% odds, showing skepticism that such a complex undertaking will materialize quickly. Source: Polymarket / Will Elon Musk create a new political party by…? The very existence of a tradable line illustrates how the Trump-Musk feud has warped traditional political timelines; traders are willing to wager real money on a scenario that six months ago sounded like science fiction. Key data points shaping the market: Volume trend: Tens of thousands of dollars traded since the poll, with liquidity climbing whenever Musk revisits the subject on X. Investor split: Short-term bears cite logistical hurdles—ballot access, funding, and legal structures—while long-term bulls believe Musk’s brand and capital could upend the two-party status quo. Sentiment driver: Each favorable poll or supportive repost nudges “Yes” bids higher, but odds pull back whenever Musk shifts focus to SpaceX or Tesla updates. Historical context: No modern presidential contender has successfully launched a viable third party within two years, a fact repeatedly cited in trader chat rooms to cap enthusiasm. Impeachment Odds Show Real Political Risk While a Musk-led party remains speculative, the market for a 2025 impeachment of Donald Trump has become one of Polymarket’s largest cash magnets. Source: Polymarket / Will Trump be impeached in 2025? Open interest now exceeds US$800,000, and implied probability has crept up to 11%—a modest but measurable rise after Musk amplified calls for Trump’s removal over a GOP spending bill. For comparison, impeachment contracts for sitting presidents rarely breach the mid-teens without an active scandal, making a double-digit line this early in the term unusual. What traders are watching: Catalyst effect: Every sharp Musk criticism (especially tweets invoking impeachment) adds a percentage point or two to “Yes” pricing. Party control calculus: Skeptics emphasize Republican dominance in the House, keeping odds below 15%. Liquidity concentration: Large single-ticket wagers (US$10k+ blocks) suggest institutional or whale participation, a rarity in feud-specific markets. Risk hedging: Political consultants reportedly use the contract to hedge against legislative paralysis that could affect policy-sensitive sectors such as defense and energy. Together, the party-creation and impeachment markets show how the Trump-Musk feud is feeding long-horizon bets with genuine policy implications. As of 12:45 p.m. ET on June 9, 2025, the Solana-based Official Trump (TRUMP) token changes hands at $10.62, up 1.7% in the past 24 hours and roughly 4.8% on the week. Meanwhile, Dogecoin (DOGE)—still Elon Musk’s tongue-in-cheek favourite—trades at $0.1868, a slim 0.8% daily gain and about 2% higher than last Monday. Lawsuit Talk: Could the Courtroom Host the Next Round? While the Trump-Musk feud has largely played out on television screens and social feeds, a Kalshi contract now pegs the chance of Trump filing a lawsuit against Elon Musk in 2025 at roughly 18%. That probability may look small, yet it is high enough to attract steady inflows whenever the President hints at legal retaliation. Traders cite several theoretical flashpoints—from defamation claims to alleged business interference—as pathways to litigation, though none have been formally pursued. Key indicators: Liquidity pattern: Modest but growing; new money enters whenever Trump’s advisors reference “legal options.” Price sensitivity: A single Trump statement can move the line by 2–3 percentage points. Participant base: A mix of retail punters and a handful of larger accounts hedging reputational risk for companies exposed to the feud. Context check: Despite recurring threats, Trump has historically favored public sparring over protracted courtroom battles with high-profile entrepreneurs. Jail-Time Contract Shows Appetite for Extreme Outcomes The wildest of the crypto prediction market lines asks whether Trump will succeed in putting Musk behind bars during his term. On Polymarket, “Yes” shares briefly rallied to 6.8% before sanity reasserted itself, pushing the figure down to about 4%. Source: Polymarket / Will Trump jail Elon Musk? Though traders now see imprisonment as a remote possibility, the contract still commands attention, and roughly US$60,000 in combined open interest across Polymarket’s black-swan cluster. Key takeaways: Early spike catalyst: Trump’s off-the-cuff threats against Musk-linked businesses fanned speculative buying. Rapid correction: Legal experts on X argued the scenario had no practical basis, prompting a cascade of “No” sells. Current spread: The bid-ask gap has widened as volatility drops, showing consensus around a low-probability tail risk. Psychology angle: Bettors treat the line as both an insurance hedge and a tongue-in-cheek barometer of political animosity. Together, the lawsuit and jail-time contracts reveal a core dynamic of the feud’s more sensational wagers: even outcomes deemed highly unlikely still attract real dollars, illustrating how prediction markets convert headline hyperbole into quantifiable market sentiment. Why the Trump-Musk Feud Bets Matter Each price move in the Musk-Trump feud markets captures real money weighing reputational jolts, legislative risk, and even the remote chance of courtroom drama, giving outsiders a live barometer of public sentiment that traditional polling can’t match. The data show bettors doubt dramatic flashpoints such as an X suspension or a presidential apology, yet they assign meaningful probabilities to longer-horizon pivots: a Musk-branded third party, an impeachment push energized by the feud, or a strategic lawsuit. In other words, traders are discounting the theatrics while hedging against structural shocks. For readers, the takeaway is less about cheering for either protagonist and more about recognizing that decentralized markets now sit at the intersection of politics, celebrity, and finance, translating every tweet, press-conference jab, or viral poll into immediate, quantifiable fallout. Against the backdrop of soaring volumes, the markets offer a real-time snapshot of public sentiment toward two of the most polarizing figures in politics and tech, and they are rewriting how quickly narrative drama can be monetized.

Representatives from the two countries concluded their first meeting, which lasted more than six hours, at Lancaster House in London, according to US officials. The talks concluded at around 8pm and the sides will meet again at 5pm on Tuesday (tomorrow). “Things are going well with China. China is not an easy country,” President Trump told reporters at the White House, adding that he had only received positive reports. The U.S. delegation was led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer also took part in the talks. Lutnick's position as former Cantor Fitzgerald CEO underscored the importance of export controls in these talks. “We had a good meeting,” Bessent told reporters in London, while Lutnick described the talks as “productive.” The Chinese delegation was led by Deputy Prime Minister He Lifeng, but Lifeng left without speaking to the media. Related News: Today's Most Anticipated Event: SEC Holds Cryptocurrency Meeting, Chair Makes Statement The U.S. has said it is willing to lift some technology export restrictions in exchange for China easing restrictions on rare earths shipments. Rare earths are critical to many energy, defense and technology products, including smartphones, fighter jets and nuclear reactor rods. China accounts for 70% of the world’s production. The Trump administration is preparing to lift restrictions it put in place in recent weeks on chip design software, jet engine parts, chemicals and nuclear materials, but Trump has not made any specific announcements about lifting those restrictions, saying “we'll see.” The White House National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said in a statement from Washington that the U.S. expects to ease export restrictions after talks in London and China to ship more rare earths. But Hassett reiterated that the most advanced Nvidia chips will not be exempt from those restrictions. This first round of talks was a step toward understanding how well both sides are holding to their Geneva commitments. In talks last month, Washington and Beijing agreed to cut devastating tariffs for 90 days in an effort to balance trade. A phone call last week between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared to generate fresh momentum for a new deal. *This is not investment advice.

A recent, noteworthy development comes from the UK-listed firm, Anemoi, which has announced a significant allocation to the leading cryptocurrency. This move places Anemoi Bitcoin investment firmly on the radar of market watchers, highlighting a growing trend towards incorporating digital assets into traditional financial planning. Anemoi’s Strategic Shift: Embracing a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy In a move that underscores a revised approach to managing its financial assets, UK-listed Anemoi has strategically allocated a substantial portion of its cash reserves to Bitcoin. According to a company statement disseminated via EQS News, approximately 30% of Anemoi’s cash is now held in the pioneering cryptocurrency. The company’s board explicitly stated that this decision aligns with its updated treasury approach. This isn’t just a speculative flutter; it signals a deliberate and considered shift in how Anemoi views the management of its corporate funds, potentially setting a precedent for other firms, particularly within the UK market. The statement also hinted at further announcements regarding Anemoi’s financial and business strategies. This suggests the Bitcoin allocation is part of a broader strategic evolution within the company, indicating that stakeholders can expect more details on how this digital asset integration will impact their overall operations and financial health. Why Are Companies Like Anemoi Considering Corporate Treasury Bitcoin ? Anemoi’s decision is not isolated. It reflects a burgeoning trend of companies, both large and small, evaluating or executing investments in Bitcoin for their treasury holdings. Several factors are driving this interest: Inflation Hedge: In an era of quantitative easing and concerns about currency devaluation, Bitcoin’s fixed supply is seen by some as a potential hedge against inflation, preserving purchasing power over the long term. Store of Value: Often dubbed ‘digital gold’, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a robust store of value, offering a potential alternative to traditional safe-haven assets. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a treasury portfolio can offer diversification away from traditional assets like cash, bonds, and equities, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk (though introducing new forms of risk). Potential for Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has demonstrated significant long-term price appreciation, offering the potential for substantial returns on treasury funds that would otherwise yield minimal interest in traditional low-rate environments. Future-Proofing: Embracing digital assets can position a company at the forefront of financial innovation, potentially aligning with future trends in finance and technology. For a UK Company Bitcoin allocation is still relatively novel compared to some counterparts in the US, making Anemoi’s move particularly notable within the British corporate landscape. The Rise of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption : Anemoi Joins the Ranks Anemoi’s investment is another data point in the accelerating trend of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption . While giants like MicroStrategy and Tesla captured early headlines with large-scale Bitcoin purchases, the movement is broadening. Smaller and mid-sized companies across various sectors are now considering or implementing similar strategies. This growing institutional interest lends legitimacy to Bitcoin as an asset class and can contribute to its price stability and wider acceptance. This adoption isn’t limited to direct treasury investments. It also includes: Financial institutions offering Bitcoin-related products (ETFs, custody services). Payment processors integrating Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Venture capital funding flowing into crypto startups. Anemoi’s decision, therefore, is part of a larger global narrative where traditional finance is increasingly intersecting with the digital asset space. It highlights that the conversation around Bitcoin is moving beyond individual investors and becoming a serious consideration in corporate boardrooms. Navigating the Challenges of a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy While the potential benefits are attractive, adopting a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy comes with significant challenges that companies like Anemoi must address: Challenge Description Volatility Bitcoin’s price can experience rapid and significant fluctuations, potentially impacting the reported value of treasury holdings. Regulatory Uncertainty The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, including in the UK, posing compliance and legal risks. Security Risks Storing and managing private keys requires robust security protocols to prevent loss or theft. Accounting and Tax Treatment Accounting for Bitcoin holdings can be complex, and tax implications vary by jurisdiction and can be challenging to navigate. Public Perception Investing in a volatile and sometimes controversial asset like Bitcoin can impact shareholder and public perception. Companies must have a clear understanding of these risks and implement appropriate risk management strategies, including secure custody solutions and clear accounting policies, before making such an allocation. Anemoi’s board likely considered these factors as part of their revised treasury approach. What Anemoi’s Move Could Mean for the Future Anemoi’s allocation of 30% of its cash to Bitcoin is a significant statement. It suggests a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its role within a diversified corporate treasury. As a UK Company Bitcoin investor, Anemoi’s experience will likely be watched closely by other firms in the region contemplating similar moves. The company’s promise of further updates on its financial and business strategies indicates that this is just the beginning of their journey with digital assets. Future announcements might shed light on: The specific timing and price of the Bitcoin purchase(s). Their chosen custody solution for the Bitcoin holdings. How the Bitcoin holdings will be accounted for on their balance sheet. Any potential integration of blockchain technology or cryptocurrencies into their core business operations. This development reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is transitioning from a fringe asset to a more mainstream component of corporate finance, driven by evolving views on monetary policy, asset diversification, and technological innovation. Concluding Thoughts: A Bold Step in Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Anemoi’s decision to allocate 30% of its cash reserves to Bitcoin is a bold move that highlights the increasing confidence among some corporate leaders in digital assets. This Bitcoin Treasury Strategy by a UK Company Bitcoin investor like Anemoi serves as a tangible example of the accelerating trend of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption . While challenges remain, the strategic rationale cited by Anemoi—aligning with a revised treasury approach—suggests a long-term perspective. As more companies explore Corporate Treasury Bitcoin allocations, the line between traditional finance and the digital asset ecosystem will continue to blur, potentially reshaping corporate balance sheets and investment strategies for years to come.
