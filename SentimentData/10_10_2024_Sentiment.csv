Despite recent market stagnation, the analyst highlights several key factors—including the application of Elliott Wave theory—that suggest a significant upward movement is imminent. Why XRP Looks Still ‘Super Bullish’ According to Dark Defender, the XRP price is currently determined by three trend lines. Two of these trend lines form a symmetrical triangle pattern, while the third—a downward-sloping orange line—represents a long-term downtrend that XRP has recently broken above on the monthly chart. Related Reading: Bollinger Bands Indicate XRP Price Surge Ahead Despite SEC Challenges: Expert The symmetrical triangle, formed by two converging trendlines, shows a 4-year long period of consolidation. This pattern is generally considered a continuation pattern, meaning that the price is likely to continue in the direction of the existing trend upon breakout. In XRP’s case, the price has tried to break to the upside several times – thus far without success. The third trendline, the downward-sloping orange line, has been acting as a significant resistance level for XRP since summer 2021. The fact that XRP has broken above this long-term downtrend line on the monthly chart is a strong bullish signal. This breakout suggests a shift in market sentiment from bearish to bullish, potentially leading to substantial price appreciation. Integral to Dark Defender’s analysis is the application of Elliott Wave theory to XRP’s price action. The chart shared by the analyst displays an Elliott Wave count that suggests XRP is poised to enter a Wave 3 impulse move, historically the most powerful and extended wave in the five-wave trend sequence. In this context, the analyst believes that XRP has completed Wave 2—a corrective phase characterized by downward price movement—and is now embarking on Wave 3. This wave is often marked by strong momentum and increased market participation, potentially explaining the anticipated surge above $5.85. The projected target aligns with Fibonacci extension levels commonly associated with Wave 3 movements, providing a technical basis for the significant price increase. In the short term, the 70.2% Fibonacci price level at $0.6649 is the most crucial resistance for XRP. If this barrier breaks, wave 3 could be confirmed. A first major extension target would be the 161.8% Fibonacci level at $1.88. The ultimate target could be the 261.8% Fibonacci level at $5.85. Related Reading: XRP Macro Charts Signal Explosive Bullish Move Despite SEC Appeal: Analyst The analyst also points out that the Heikin Ashi candles are currently averaging at $0.57 on the monthly chart. “When Heikin Ashi Candles (average-price candles, currently at $0.57) are considered, the monthly average price stays above the support level, which is critical for XRP to continue the momentum,” Dark Defender notes. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator on the monthly timeframe has printed a green dot, a bullish signal suggesting increasing upward momentum. The MACD is a momentum oscillator that helps traders identify potential trend reversals. A green dot typically signifies that the MACD line has crossed above the signal line, indicating a positive shift in momentum. Ultimately, Dark Defender contends that XRP’s price action is largely independent of external news events, including developments related to the SEC lawsuit against Ripple. While acknowledging that such news can have a minor impact, the analyst argues that technical patterns and indicators hold more sway over XRP’s movements. “As most expected, nothing happened after the appeal decision. XRP just were at the Ichimoku clouds top around $0.60+ levels and bounced back from there to $0.50+. I am Bullish; why? As I always highlight, XRP does not follow any news such as SEC. OK, they have a minor impact, but that’s it,” Dark Defender notes. Based on the technical factors outlined—including the breakout above the long-term downtrend line, the significance of the symmetrical triangle, the importance of the Heikin Ashi monthly average price, bullish signals from the MACD, and the Elliott Wave count—Dark Defender is “super bullish” on XRP. The analyst anticipates that the asset will follow historical patterns leading to a price exceeding $5.85. At press time, XRP traded at $0.53.

Following a dramatic series of price swings—first a 27% surge, then a 20% retrace, then a 10% rise, and now a 7% dip to $0.34—Cardano finds itself at one of its most critical support levels. Holding this level is essential for bulls to maintain momentum and avoid a deeper decline. Related Reading: Dogecoin Analyst Expects A ‘Multi-Year Bullish Breakout’ – 200% Surge Potential Market data from Coinglass indicates that ADA may be entering a consolidation phase, often preceding a significant price move. Investors and traders closely watch this level, as it could determine whether Cardano is poised for a bullish breakout or a deeper correction. With the entire crypto market in a state of anticipation, ADA’s upcoming price action will be key in signaling its next trend. As sentiment remains mixed, this consolidation period will likely set the tone for Cardano’s direction in the coming weeks. Cardano Funding Rate Suggests Market Consolidation Cardano (ADA) is showing signs of entering a potential consolidation phase, a crucial moment for investors as they evaluate the next move. Recent on-chain data highlights a surge in large transactions followed by stabilization, suggesting that the market is cooling off after weeks of volatility. This stabilization could pave the way for more balanced price action as ADA hovers around a key support level. Coinglass data further reinforces the consolidation narrative. The ADA Open Interest (OI)-Weighted Funding Rate has declined yet remains positive. A declining but positive funding rate indicates that demand for ADA is slowing down, but not to a degree where the market expects heavy short-selling. In crypto, when funding rates dip but stay in positive territory, the market consolidates rather than preparing for a sharp downward movement. This suggests that while ADA’s upward momentum has slowed, there isn’t yet an overwhelming bearish sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Failed Attempt To Break $64,000 Could Lead To A Disaster – Analyst If ADA manages to hold above current levels during this consolidation phase, it would signal healthy price action. The key is whether bulls can defend these levels, potentially leading to a more sustained rally in the weeks ahead. Investors must monitor these indicators closely as the market tests ADA’s resilience. ADA Testing Crucial Support Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.34 after failing to reclaim two critical levels: the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) at $0.356 and the 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $0.359. These indicators are crucial for ADA to regain bullish momentum, and their rejection signals potential weakness in the price action. Despite this, ADA is still holding above a key support level at $0.34. If this level is lost, the price could face a significant retracement, with lower demand levels around $0.32 and potentially $0.30 being tested. This makes the $0.34 support critical for maintaining current market sentiment. Conversely, if ADA can reclaim the 4-hour 200 MA and 200 EMA, breaking above $0.36, it could set the stage for a rally toward higher resistance levels. The next significant supply zone to watch would be around $0.41, where further bullish momentum could face its next challenge. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Reclaim $2,700 As Key Data Signals Reduced Selling Pressure The coming days will be pivotal for ADA as it consolidates and prepares for its next move.

This decision comes at a critical time for the crypto market, as creditors are poised to receive more than $12 billion through the court-sanctioned payout plan, raising the possibility that some of these funds could be reinvested into the digital asset ecosystem, potentially influencing market prices. Market Awaits FTX Liquidation Impact In June, FTX reported having $12.6 billion available for customer repayments, a figure that could increase to $16.5 billion as additional assets are identified and liquidated. The initial distribution of around $1.1 billion, while relatively modest, is expected to provide support for Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies such as Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH), according to Alex Thorn, the head of research at Galaxy Digital Holdings. Related Reading: ETH’s Fate Hinges On $2,300: Will Ethereum Soar To $6,000 Or Dive To $1,600? Benjamin Celermajer, co-chief investment officer at Magnet Capital, also noted that the upcoming payouts “effectively provide liquidity to known crypto traders”. He highlighted the likelihood that some of these funds will flow back into the cryptocurrency market, potentially acting as a price catalyst for “liquidity-starved assets.” However, it is important to note that the repayments from FTX will not occur immediately. Bloomberg reports that the exchange must establish a trust and hire a company to oversee the distribution process. Repayments Expected To Take Years? Galaxy Digital says payments to smaller creditors may begin as early as December, while larger claims will be addressed in the first half of next year. Some remaining claims could take up to three years to resolve. Research firm K33 has estimated a “latent demand from FTX reallocators” of around $2.4 billion. However, they caution that the impact on the crypto market may be “soft” due to the staggered nature of the repayments expected over the next year.

Ellison has reached a settlement that includes the transfer of her assets that have not already been confiscated by the government or used for legal fees, FTX said in a court filing on Monday. Ellison, who is also the former romantic partner of the now convicted Sam Bankman-Fried, also agreed to cooperate with the bankruptcy estate in current and future investigations. Upon completion of the settlement, Ellison will retain only certain physical personal property. When writing, the defunct exchange’s native token FTT is trading at $2.25, down from an 8-month high of $3 reached after the bankruptcy plan was approved on Monday.

Bitcoin: Gauging The Performances Of Two Crypto Giants This Cycle,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/dogecoin-bitcoin-this-cycle/,"Crypto analyst James has compared Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bitcoin (BTC) and provided insights into what to expect from these major cryptocurrencies in this market cycle. Based on his analysis, the foremost meme coin will likely outperform the flagship cryptocurrency in this bull run. What To Expect From Dogecoin And Bitcoin In This Cycle James suggested in an X post that Dogecoin will likely outperform Bitcoin in this market cycle. The analyst noted that since Dogecoin’s launch in 2013, the foremost meme coin has consistently outperformed the flagship crypto in every cycle despite the over 90% drawdowns witnessed in those cycles. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Massive 8,400% Rise For XRP Price To $44, Calls It ‘Conservative’ The analyst also highlighted the performances of these coins since their inception. He noted that most of Bitcoin’s gain came during its first cycle, likely because it was the first cryptocurrency. However, since then, Bitcoin’s gains have decreased over the last three cycles. Meanwhile, Dogecoin has enjoyed price gains in every successive market cycle. The foremost meme coin is said to have surged by over 54,000% in the 2018 bull market and a price gain of over 54,800% in the 2021 bull run. In line with this, James is confident that Dogecoin will again surpass its previous two cycles’ percentage gains while Bitcoin will record smaller gains in this bull run compared to the previous cycles. Interestingly, the analyst asserted that Dogecoin is the “stronger cryptocurrency and is poised to take over the world.” Like James, crypto analysts like Kevin Capital and Crypto Kaleo also previously predicted that Dogecoin will outperform Bitcoin in this market cycle. More recently, crypto analyst Master Kenobi also echoed a similar sentiment, citing Dogecoin’s historical performance and community-driven momentum as the reason it will outperform the flagship crypto. The Foremost Meme Coin Is Lagging Behind Despite these bullish predictions for Dogecoin, it is worth mentioning that the foremost meme coin is currently lagging behind the flagship crypto in this market cycle. CoinMarketCap data shows that the meme coin boasts a year-to-date (YTD) gain of just over 21% compared to Bitcoin, which has recorded a price gain of over 47%. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Set To Rally Over 2430% To $0.000047 As Trend Oscillator Turns Bullish Moreover, the flagship crypto already hit a new all-time high (ATH) in this bull run. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is still way below its current ATH of $0.7. However, considering James’ analysis that the meme coin has outperformed Bitcoin in previous cycles despite suffering a 90% drawdown, there remains the possibility that DOGE will still top BTC in this market cycle. Analysts like Crypto Kaleo, Kevin, and Master Kenobi have all predicted that Dogecoin could reach $1 in this bull run. That represents a price gain of over 500% from its current price. Therefore, DOGE will likely outperform BTC if it eventually reaches this price target.

An investment of $235.2 million in Bitcoin ETFs occurred on October 8, indicating a substantial increase in investor appetite. This surge, based on data from Farside Investors, follows a relatively uneventful beginning to the month, but it indicates a resurgence in investor confidence in the cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Earns Recognition For Charitable Contributions – Impact On Price Fidelity And BlackRock Lead The Way This was led by Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) with a $103.7 million inflow. iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), managed by BlackRock, received $97.9 million of inflows. Bitwise ETF BITB and ARK Invest ETF Arkb also joined with $13.1 million and $12.6 million respectively. The combined trading volume of all Bitcoin ETFs steadily grew to over a cool $1.22 billion up from just the other day. Given the erratic Bitcoin values, the comeback in ETF inflows is especially remarkable. Bitcoin was trading at roughly $62,485 at the time of writing, somewhat declining from its previous high of $66,000 to show some bearish pressure. Notwithstanding the recent price drop, the strong demand for Bitcoin ETFs shows that institutional investors are ready to profit from possible future increases. Bitcoin Edges Ethereum ETFs Unlike the optimistic sentiment connected with Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum’s ETFs tell a different story: Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were on low inflows of $7.4 million on October 6 and had no new activity on October 7. This stagnation is quite different from the active movement within Bitcoin ETFs. Analysts point out that this difference could point to changing investor tastes or worries on Ethereum’s market dynamics. The lack of inflows into Ethereum ETFs brings even more questions about whether, at present, there is any better overall market sentiment toward altcoins. Investor interest in Ethereum has subsided somewhat, as indicated, though the phenomenon of Bitcoin draws enormous volumes of institutional capital. Market Sentiment And Future Outlook Recent increases in Bitcoin ETF inflows reflect the direction of a larger market trend resulting from conjecture over possible Federal Reserve rate reduction. Many investors think this move will strengthen the market and keep prices on the ascent. If history has anything to teach us, it is that such financial easing usually encourages additional investment in risk assets including cryptocurrency. Related Reading: BlackRock Declares Bitcoin The New ‘Gold Alternative’ – Here’s Why Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas emphasizes that, given the excellent performances of both FBTC and IBIT, they are going to be very important for the future of Bitcoin ETFs. They may even touch “stud level” with over $10 billion in assets under management. And by the end of 2024 in the fourth quarter, this institutional interest is on the rise which may well bring us the bull run. Ethereum’s ETFs are presently experiencing stagnation, despite the fact that Bitcoin ETFs are experiencing a resurgence that is characterized by significant inflows and increased trading volumes. Investors are closely monitoring the market as they prepare for potential changes that may result from evolving market dynamics and changes in monetary policy. As they jointly navigate these turbulent waters, the next few weeks will be critical for both Bitcoin and Ethereum.

The next key resistance could be $0.5450. A clear move above the $0.5450 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5500 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5650 resistance or even $0.580 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $0.600. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5350 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5220 level. The next major support is near the $0.520 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.520 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5150 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.5080 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

A CryptoQuant analyst under the pseudonym “datascope” recently posted on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, providing an in-depth analysis of Bitcoin’s current price movements. The analyst highlighted that Bitcoin is at a critical psychological turning point, where market sentiment could shift towards optimism or pessimism based on its trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Loss Nears 20%: Could This Trigger A Fresh Surge? Bitcoin Historical Patterns Suggest Optimism Could Persist According to datascope, Bitcoin’s price, which currently trades just above $62,000 is sitting in a range where historical data suggests that the market participants’ outlook can sway in either direction, depending on whether they are in profit. The analyst further explained that as long as Bitcoin stays within this critical range, the chances of a significant price decline are minimal. This “zone of optimism” range has been a determining factor in previous bull markets, most notably in 2016 and 2020. The CryptoQuant analyst emphasized that the “Supply in Profit” metric, which measures the portion of Bitcoin’s circulating supply held by investors who are in profit, is a vital indicator in understanding market sentiment. In the past, whenever a significant portion of Bitcoin’s supply was in profit, it resulted in an optimistic outlook, supporting the price to push higher. Bitcoin’s current position within this zone of optimism suggests that a continued rally could be in store if the price maintains stability. #Bitcoin at a Critical Psychological Turning Point “Bitcoin’s price is sitting at a psychologically important level. Historically, when prices stayed within this range, the market continued its upward trend.” – By @0xDataScope Read more 👇https://t.co/q6FzjuhRHS pic.twitter.com/ouZIuztaJd — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) October 9, 2024 Looking back at historical bull markets, the analyst pointed out that during the bull runs of 2016 and 2020, Bitcoin maintained its position between a psychological turning point and the optimism zone, allowing the market to enter a sustained upward trend. Key Indicators To Watch Moving Forward In addition to the “Supply in Profit” metric, the CryptoQuant analyst suggests monitoring the overall market sentiment and Bitcoin’s price movements in the coming days. Should Bitcoin stay within this critical psychological range, it is less likely to experience a significant price drop. However, if Bitcoin fails to hold this zone and breaks below, market sentiment could turn bearish, leading to a further price decline.

TRX is outperforming Bitcoin and could start a fresh increase above $0.1600. Tron is stable and holding gains above $0.1560 against the US dollar. The price is trading below $0.1580 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1585 on the hourly chart of the TRX/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to climb higher toward $0.1620 or even $0.1650. Tron Price Remains Supported Recently, Bitcoin and Ethereum saw a fresh decline below $62,000 and $2,400 respectively. However, Tron price remained stable above the $0.1560 support. The price climbed higher above the $0.160 resistance level. A high was formed at $0.1618 and recently there was a downside correction. The price dipped below the $0.1600 level. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1555 swing low to the $0.1618 high. TRX price is now trading above $0.1580 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1585 on the hourly chart of the TRX/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1555 swing low to the $0.1618 high. On the upside, an initial resistance is near the $0.160 level. The first major resistance is near $0.1620, above which the price could accelerate higher. The next resistance is $0.1650. A close above the $0.1650 resistance might send TRX further higher toward $0.1685. The next major resistance is near the $0.1700 level, above which the bulls are likely to aim for a larger increase toward $0.1720 in the near term. Are Dips Supported in TRX? If TRX price fails to clear the $0.1600 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1585 zone and the trend line. The first major support is near the $0.1570 level, below which it could test $0.1550. Any more losses might send Tron toward the $0.1520 support in the coming sessions.

Key Factors To Consider, According To Analysts",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/could-xrp-finally-hit-1-key-factors-to-consider-according-to-analysts/,"Many XRP holders expect the altcoin to break $1 soon. XRP has traded around $0.50 for a while despite lingering pressure in the crypto market. Some analysts recently predicted that XRP’s long-awaited bull run will commence as Bitcoin’s dominance declines. Related Reading: $6 Million ETH Sale: Ethereum Foundation Joins Whale Liquidation Frenzy XRP Price Forecast: Positive Signs Ahead? The current price projections for XRP from CoinCheckup suggest a bullish trajectory. Analysts anticipate a 14% increase in the altcoin over the next three months, despite the fact that it is currently trading 18.77% below the estimate for the following month. This modest ascent can be a precursor of a sustainable rally, which will present traders with steady increases. XRP is seen climbing 150% in the next half-year period and 125% by 2025. The positive forecasts for this coin, therefore, suggest that this is the beginning of a strong price growth phase, courtesy of increased consumer confidence and broader adoption. Very crucial for #XRP to close this weekly candle above 55 cents or else we’ll test the support at 40 cents. The #Bitcoin dominance is almost near the top and once it starts dumping we’ll see all #Altcoins pull a 2-5x easy. Just accumulate coming year is very bullish! #Crypto pic.twitter.com/Dk0ARRnjE9 — THE GOAT TRADERS (@TheGoatTraders) October 6, 2024 Key Resistance Levels To Watch Even with these positive outlooks, XRP still has to break over a few significant resistance levels before a real bull run can start. The “GOAT” trader pointed out that in order for XRP to keep moving higher and hit $1, it needs to close above $0.55 on the weekly chart. If it fails, the altcoin might fall as low as $0.40, testing crucial support levels before attempting another rally. Another technical analyst, “Charting Guy,” has joined in, suggesting that XRP’s price movement will be greatly influenced by Bitcoin’s performance. According to him, XRP will trade between $0.43 and $0.67 until Bitcoin overcomes its $70K resistance. for people asking me when will $XRP moon or is it over, etc etc. i will repeat for the millionth time$XRP and other lagging altcoins will do NOTHING significant until $BTC breaks into price discovery it’ll range between 0.43 – 0.67 until then monthly bollinger bands continue… pic.twitter.com/GwSrwJEDI0 — Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy) October 6, 2024 Bitcoin’s Impact On XRP’s Future Bitcoin has been in a quite limited trading range and has not yet broken beyond $70,000. Although the top coin peaked in March at $73K, it struggled to maintain the level and finally encountered continuous obstacles that is preventing it from reaching a new price discovery phase. So long as Bitcoin is below this crucial level, Altcoins that are underperforming, such as XRP could continue to trade sideways. According to Charting Guy, breaking resistance would be the critical support for the upward trajectory of XRP. Related Reading: Analyst Foresees 90% Cardano Price Drop in Next 6 Months Bollinger Band Tightening: What It Means For The Altcoin Meanwhile, XRP’s Bollinger Bands have tightened on the monthly chart. This tightening typically indicates that a significant price shift is approaching. Charting Guy speculated that if XRP closes over $0.67, it might spark a big rise. On the other hand, a monthly close below $0.43 could result in a significant drop. Investors should keep a close eye on these important levels to see where XRP may go next.

Factors To Propel Bitcoin To $80,000 Hougan highlighted three essential conditions that could push BTC to new all-time highs (ATH) in 2024. First, he pointed to November’s upcoming U.S. presidential elections, which could influence BTC’s future price trajectory. According to Hougan, anything other than a Democratic sweep would benefit the top cryptocurrency by market cap. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst: Bull Market Hinges On This Indicator Reaching 45% In the memo, Hougan explained that while many view the election as a binary choice – with Republican candidate Donald Trump favorable for the crypto industry and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris seen as detrimental – the reality on the Democratic side is more nuanced. He said: The Democratic Party has disparate views on crypto, from Senator Elizabeth Warren’s (D-Mass.) “Anti-Crypto Army” to Representative Ritchie Torres’ (D-N.Y.) deep support. The problem of the past four years is that the Warren wing has controlled policy and agency appointments, and that has created a hostile environment for the sector. Hougan expressed confidence in the Republicans, stating that a win for them would “undoubtedly” be positive for crypto. However, he also referenced a recent comment by Democrat Maxine Waters, who said that “crypto is inevitable,” suggesting that Democrats may become more open to digital assets. Second, Hougan brought attention to the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) interest rate cuts. On September 18, the Fed lowered key interest rates by 50 basis points (bps), sparking a crypto rally. Further, the People’s Bank of China’s (PBoC) decision to inject economic stimulus into the Chinese economy gave more fuel to digital assets to propel. Hougan noted that the market expects another 50 bps rate cut from the Fed before year-end, along with additional Chinese fiscal stimulus. The crypto market could see a strong Q4 2024 rally if both occur. Finally, Hougan mentioned that a period with no major surprises would support BTC’s potential rally to $80,000. He concluded that negative surprises, such as a significant crypto exchange hack, new lawsuits, or the release of previously locked coins could derail this momentum. Key Ingredient For The Rip To $100,000 BTC Hougan also stated that growing pro-crypto sentiment would be necessary for BTC to reach the ambitious $100,000 target in the coming months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tumbles Following Higher Than Anticipated US Core Inflation Data He recalled the famous “DeFi summer” of 2020 as an example and envisions a similar market-wide shift toward crypto, driven by the rising use of stablecoins, high-throughput blockchains, and innovation in passive yield solutions. In related news, CEO of crypto mining firm CleanSpark, Zach Bradford, recently opined that Bitcoin could reach as high as $200,000 in the next 18 months given the right conditions. That being said, recent geopolitical escalations in the Middle East can adversely impact risk-on assets such as stocks and crypto in the short term. BTC trades at $61,999 at press time, down 1.4% in the last 24 hours.

The post, shared on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, highlights notable changes in both long-term and short-term holder behaviour of Bitcoin, as well as in realized profit and loss figures. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Non-Realized Profits Hit Negative Levels—What Does This Mean for Investors? Key Bitcoin Metrics Suggesting Market Shifts Taha begins by explaining the fundamental difference between short-term and long-term Bitcoin holders. Short-term holders (STH) are traders who engage in brief buying and selling activities, often employing strategies like day trading or swing trading to capitalize on Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. On the other hand, long-term holders (LTH) adopt a buy-and-hold strategy, aiming for long-term gains by holding onto their Bitcoin for extended periods. This distinction sets the stage for understanding the recent changes in market activity. In his analysis, Taha noted a sharp decline in the realized capitalization for long-term holders, which dropped from $19 billion to -$5 billion. This indicates that long-term holders have been taking profits or closing their positions, potentially signalling reduced confidence in further price gains. On the flip side, short-term holders have increased their buying activity, with their realized capitalization rising from -$17 billion to $11 billion. This suggests that short-term traders either take on more risk or bet on potential price increases, creating a more volatile market environment. Additionally, Taha touched on the Korea Premium Index, often called the “Kimchi Premium.” This index tracks the price difference between Bitcoin traded on South Korean and global exchanges. Currently, the index is near zero or negative, meaning Bitcoin is trading at a lower price in South Korea than the rest of the world. This implies reduced buying pressure from Korean traders, who have historically played a large role in increasing cryptocurrency prices due to the local trading culture. A negative premium suggests low demand from South Korean investors, potentially adding to the market’s uncertainty. Net Realized Profit And Loss Trends Another key metric Taha focused on is Bitcoin’s net realized profit and loss (NRPL), which tracks market participants’ total net profit or loss. Positive NRPL values indicate that more investors are taking profits, while negative values suggest more losses are being realized. Currently, the NRPL is approaching a critical $4 billion mark. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forecast: This Week’s Trends And Historical Patterns For Q4 Taha highlighted that crossing the $4 billion threshold in past market cycles has often coincided with significant market peaks or troughs. The red line marking the $4 billion level across the chart (above) represents a key point of market activity. According to the analyst, when NRPL crosses this line, it can indicate a surge in trading activity as more investors either lock in their profits or cut their losses. Taha further pointed out that these points have historically been pivotal moments in Bitcoin’s price action, and the current proximity to this level suggests that another significant market movement could be on the horizon.
