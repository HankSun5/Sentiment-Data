Despite recent market stagnation, the analyst highlights several key factors—including the application of Elliott Wave theory—that suggest a significant upward movement is imminent. Why XRP Looks Still ‘Super Bullish’ According to Dark Defender, the XRP price is currently determined by three trend lines. Two of these trend lines form a symmetrical triangle pattern, while the third—a downward-sloping orange line—represents a long-term downtrend that XRP has recently broken above on the monthly chart. Related Reading: Bollinger Bands Indicate XRP Price Surge Ahead Despite SEC Challenges: Expert The symmetrical triangle, formed by two converging trendlines, shows a 4-year long period of consolidation. This pattern is generally considered a continuation pattern, meaning that the price is likely to continue in the direction of the existing trend upon breakout. In XRP’s case, the price has tried to break to the upside several times – thus far without success. The third trendline, the downward-sloping orange line, has been acting as a significant resistance level for XRP since summer 2021. The fact that XRP has broken above this long-term downtrend line on the monthly chart is a strong bullish signal. This breakout suggests a shift in market sentiment from bearish to bullish, potentially leading to substantial price appreciation. Integral to Dark Defender’s analysis is the application of Elliott Wave theory to XRP’s price action. The chart shared by the analyst displays an Elliott Wave count that suggests XRP is poised to enter a Wave 3 impulse move, historically the most powerful and extended wave in the five-wave trend sequence. In this context, the analyst believes that XRP has completed Wave 2—a corrective phase characterized by downward price movement—and is now embarking on Wave 3. This wave is often marked by strong momentum and increased market participation, potentially explaining the anticipated surge above $5.85. The projected target aligns with Fibonacci extension levels commonly associated with Wave 3 movements, providing a technical basis for the significant price increase. In the short term, the 70.2% Fibonacci price level at $0.6649 is the most crucial resistance for XRP. If this barrier breaks, wave 3 could be confirmed. A first major extension target would be the 161.8% Fibonacci level at $1.88. The ultimate target could be the 261.8% Fibonacci level at $5.85. Related Reading: XRP Macro Charts Signal Explosive Bullish Move Despite SEC Appeal: Analyst The analyst also points out that the Heikin Ashi candles are currently averaging at $0.57 on the monthly chart. “When Heikin Ashi Candles (average-price candles, currently at $0.57) are considered, the monthly average price stays above the support level, which is critical for XRP to continue the momentum,” Dark Defender notes. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator on the monthly timeframe has printed a green dot, a bullish signal suggesting increasing upward momentum. The MACD is a momentum oscillator that helps traders identify potential trend reversals. A green dot typically signifies that the MACD line has crossed above the signal line, indicating a positive shift in momentum. Ultimately, Dark Defender contends that XRP’s price action is largely independent of external news events, including developments related to the SEC lawsuit against Ripple. While acknowledging that such news can have a minor impact, the analyst argues that technical patterns and indicators hold more sway over XRP’s movements. “As most expected, nothing happened after the appeal decision. XRP just were at the Ichimoku clouds top around $0.60+ levels and bounced back from there to $0.50+. I am Bullish; why? As I always highlight, XRP does not follow any news such as SEC. OK, they have a minor impact, but that’s it,” Dark Defender notes. Based on the technical factors outlined—including the breakout above the long-term downtrend line, the significance of the symmetrical triangle, the importance of the Heikin Ashi monthly average price, bullish signals from the MACD, and the Elliott Wave count—Dark Defender is “super bullish” on XRP. The analyst anticipates that the asset will follow historical patterns leading to a price exceeding $5.85. At press time, XRP traded at $0.53.

Following a dramatic series of price swings—first a 27% surge, then a 20% retrace, then a 10% rise, and now a 7% dip to $0.34—Cardano finds itself at one of its most critical support levels. Holding this level is essential for bulls to maintain momentum and avoid a deeper decline. Related Reading: Dogecoin Analyst Expects A ‘Multi-Year Bullish Breakout’ – 200% Surge Potential Market data from Coinglass indicates that ADA may be entering a consolidation phase, often preceding a significant price move. Investors and traders closely watch this level, as it could determine whether Cardano is poised for a bullish breakout or a deeper correction. With the entire crypto market in a state of anticipation, ADA’s upcoming price action will be key in signaling its next trend. As sentiment remains mixed, this consolidation period will likely set the tone for Cardano’s direction in the coming weeks. Cardano Funding Rate Suggests Market Consolidation Cardano (ADA) is showing signs of entering a potential consolidation phase, a crucial moment for investors as they evaluate the next move. Recent on-chain data highlights a surge in large transactions followed by stabilization, suggesting that the market is cooling off after weeks of volatility. This stabilization could pave the way for more balanced price action as ADA hovers around a key support level. Coinglass data further reinforces the consolidation narrative. The ADA Open Interest (OI)-Weighted Funding Rate has declined yet remains positive. A declining but positive funding rate indicates that demand for ADA is slowing down, but not to a degree where the market expects heavy short-selling. In crypto, when funding rates dip but stay in positive territory, the market consolidates rather than preparing for a sharp downward movement. This suggests that while ADA’s upward momentum has slowed, there isn’t yet an overwhelming bearish sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Failed Attempt To Break $64,000 Could Lead To A Disaster – Analyst If ADA manages to hold above current levels during this consolidation phase, it would signal healthy price action. The key is whether bulls can defend these levels, potentially leading to a more sustained rally in the weeks ahead. Investors must monitor these indicators closely as the market tests ADA’s resilience. ADA Testing Crucial Support Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.34 after failing to reclaim two critical levels: the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) at $0.356 and the 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $0.359. These indicators are crucial for ADA to regain bullish momentum, and their rejection signals potential weakness in the price action. Despite this, ADA is still holding above a key support level at $0.34. If this level is lost, the price could face a significant retracement, with lower demand levels around $0.32 and potentially $0.30 being tested. This makes the $0.34 support critical for maintaining current market sentiment. Conversely, if ADA can reclaim the 4-hour 200 MA and 200 EMA, breaking above $0.36, it could set the stage for a rally toward higher resistance levels. The next significant supply zone to watch would be around $0.41, where further bullish momentum could face its next challenge. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Reclaim $2,700 As Key Data Signals Reduced Selling Pressure The coming days will be pivotal for ADA as it consolidates and prepares for its next move.

34511431,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647176,1728522031,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,FTX Bankruptcy: Key Dates For The $16 Billion Payout And Potential Market Effects,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ftx-ftt-bankman/ftx-bankruptcy-key-dates-for-the-16-billion-payout-and-potential-market-effects/,"On Monday, a US bankruptcy court officially approved the liquidation plan for cryptocurrency exchange FTX, allowing the company to repay its customers using approximately $16 billion in recovered assets. This decision comes at a critical time for the crypto market, as creditors are poised to receive more than $12 billion through the court-sanctioned payout plan, raising the possibility that some of these funds could be reinvested into the digital asset ecosystem, potentially influencing market prices. Market Awaits FTX Liquidation Impact In June, FTX reported having $12.6 billion available for customer repayments, a figure that could increase to $16.5 billion as additional assets are identified and liquidated. The initial distribution of around $1.1 billion, while relatively modest, is expected to provide support for Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies such as Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH), according to Alex Thorn, the head of research at Galaxy Digital Holdings. Related Reading: ETH’s Fate Hinges On $2,300: Will Ethereum Soar To $6,000 Or Dive To $1,600? Benjamin Celermajer, co-chief investment officer at Magnet Capital, also noted that the upcoming payouts “effectively provide liquidity to known crypto traders”. He highlighted the likelihood that some of these funds will flow back into the cryptocurrency market, potentially acting as a price catalyst for “liquidity-starved assets.” However, it is important to note that the repayments from FTX will not occur immediately. Bloomberg reports that the exchange must establish a trust and hire a company to oversee the distribution process. Repayments Expected To Take Years? Galaxy Digital says payments to smaller creditors may begin as early as December, while larger claims will be addressed in the first half of next year. Some remaining claims could take up to three years to resolve. Research firm K33 has estimated a “latent demand from FTX reallocators” of around $2.4 billion. However, they caution that the impact on the crypto market may be “soft” due to the staggered nature of the repayments expected over the next year.

Ellison has reached a settlement that includes the transfer of her assets that have not already been confiscated by the government or used for legal fees, FTX said in a court filing on Monday. Ellison, who is also the former romantic partner of the now convicted Sam Bankman-Fried, also agreed to cooperate with the bankruptcy estate in current and future investigations. Upon completion of the settlement, Ellison will retain only certain physical personal property. When writing, the defunct exchange’s native token FTT is trading at $2.25, down from an 8-month high of $3 reached after the bankruptcy plan was approved on Monday.

Bitcoin: Gauging The Performances Of Two Crypto Giants This Cycle,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/dogecoin-bitcoin-this-cycle/,"Crypto analyst James has compared Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bitcoin (BTC) and provided insights into what to expect from these major cryptocurrencies in this market cycle. Based on his analysis, the foremost meme coin will likely outperform the flagship cryptocurrency in this bull run. What To Expect From Dogecoin And Bitcoin In This Cycle James suggested in an X post that Dogecoin will likely outperform Bitcoin in this market cycle. The analyst noted that since Dogecoin’s launch in 2013, the foremost meme coin has consistently outperformed the flagship crypto in every cycle despite the over 90% drawdowns witnessed in those cycles. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Massive 8,400% Rise For XRP Price To $44, Calls It ‘Conservative’ The analyst also highlighted the performances of these coins since their inception. He noted that most of Bitcoin’s gain came during its first cycle, likely because it was the first cryptocurrency. However, since then, Bitcoin’s gains have decreased over the last three cycles. Meanwhile, Dogecoin has enjoyed price gains in every successive market cycle. The foremost meme coin is said to have surged by over 54,000% in the 2018 bull market and a price gain of over 54,800% in the 2021 bull run. In line with this, James is confident that Dogecoin will again surpass its previous two cycles’ percentage gains while Bitcoin will record smaller gains in this bull run compared to the previous cycles. Interestingly, the analyst asserted that Dogecoin is the “stronger cryptocurrency and is poised to take over the world.” Like James, crypto analysts like Kevin Capital and Crypto Kaleo also previously predicted that Dogecoin will outperform Bitcoin in this market cycle. More recently, crypto analyst Master Kenobi also echoed a similar sentiment, citing Dogecoin’s historical performance and community-driven momentum as the reason it will outperform the flagship crypto. The Foremost Meme Coin Is Lagging Behind Despite these bullish predictions for Dogecoin, it is worth mentioning that the foremost meme coin is currently lagging behind the flagship crypto in this market cycle. CoinMarketCap data shows that the meme coin boasts a year-to-date (YTD) gain of just over 21% compared to Bitcoin, which has recorded a price gain of over 47%. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Set To Rally Over 2430% To $0.000047 As Trend Oscillator Turns Bullish Moreover, the flagship crypto already hit a new all-time high (ATH) in this bull run. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is still way below its current ATH of $0.7. However, considering James’ analysis that the meme coin has outperformed Bitcoin in previous cycles despite suffering a 90% drawdown, there remains the possibility that DOGE will still top BTC in this market cycle. Analysts like Crypto Kaleo, Kevin, and Master Kenobi have all predicted that Dogecoin could reach $1 in this bull run. That represents a price gain of over 500% from its current price. Therefore, DOGE will likely outperform BTC if it eventually reaches this price target.

An investment of $235.2 million in Bitcoin ETFs occurred on October 8, indicating a substantial increase in investor appetite. This surge, based on data from Farside Investors, follows a relatively uneventful beginning to the month, but it indicates a resurgence in investor confidence in the cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Earns Recognition For Charitable Contributions – Impact On Price Fidelity And BlackRock Lead The Way This was led by Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) with a $103.7 million inflow. iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), managed by BlackRock, received $97.9 million of inflows. Bitwise ETF BITB and ARK Invest ETF Arkb also joined with $13.1 million and $12.6 million respectively. The combined trading volume of all Bitcoin ETFs steadily grew to over a cool $1.22 billion up from just the other day. Given the erratic Bitcoin values, the comeback in ETF inflows is especially remarkable. Bitcoin was trading at roughly $62,485 at the time of writing, somewhat declining from its previous high of $66,000 to show some bearish pressure. Notwithstanding the recent price drop, the strong demand for Bitcoin ETFs shows that institutional investors are ready to profit from possible future increases. Bitcoin Edges Ethereum ETFs Unlike the optimistic sentiment connected with Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum’s ETFs tell a different story: Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were on low inflows of $7.4 million on October 6 and had no new activity on October 7. This stagnation is quite different from the active movement within Bitcoin ETFs. Analysts point out that this difference could point to changing investor tastes or worries on Ethereum’s market dynamics. The lack of inflows into Ethereum ETFs brings even more questions about whether, at present, there is any better overall market sentiment toward altcoins. Investor interest in Ethereum has subsided somewhat, as indicated, though the phenomenon of Bitcoin draws enormous volumes of institutional capital. Market Sentiment And Future Outlook Recent increases in Bitcoin ETF inflows reflect the direction of a larger market trend resulting from conjecture over possible Federal Reserve rate reduction. Many investors think this move will strengthen the market and keep prices on the ascent. If history has anything to teach us, it is that such financial easing usually encourages additional investment in risk assets including cryptocurrency. Related Reading: BlackRock Declares Bitcoin The New ‘Gold Alternative’ – Here’s Why Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas emphasizes that, given the excellent performances of both FBTC and IBIT, they are going to be very important for the future of Bitcoin ETFs. They may even touch “stud level” with over $10 billion in assets under management. And by the end of 2024 in the fourth quarter, this institutional interest is on the rise which may well bring us the bull run. Ethereum’s ETFs are presently experiencing stagnation, despite the fact that Bitcoin ETFs are experiencing a resurgence that is characterized by significant inflows and increased trading volumes. Investors are closely monitoring the market as they prepare for potential changes that may result from evolving market dynamics and changes in monetary policy. As they jointly navigate these turbulent waters, the next few weeks will be critical for both Bitcoin and Ethereum.

34516890,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647245,1728533331,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,XRP Price Slows Down: Will Bears Take Over or Bulls Fight Back?,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-slows-down-0-5220/,"XRP price is still trading in a range below the $0.550 level. The price is slowly moving lower and there could be more downsides below $0.520. XRP price is still stuck in a range above the $0.5080 support. The price is now trading below $0.5300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.5285 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.5300 and $0.5320 resistance levels. XRP Price Dips Further XRP price failed to start a fresh increase above the $0.5350 resistance. It started another decline and traded below the $0.5250 support level. However, losses were limited compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. A low was formed at $0.5210 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor increase within a range and the price climbed above the $0.5250 resistance. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.5354 swing high to the $0.5210 low. The price is now trading below $0.5320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is another increase, the price might face resistance near the $0.5300 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.5285 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.5354 swing high to the $0.5210 low. The first major resistance is near the $0.5350 level. The next key resistance could be $0.5450. A clear move above the $0.5450 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5500 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5650 resistance or even $0.580 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $0.600. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5350 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5220 level. The next major support is near the $0.520 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.520 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5150 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.5080 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.5220 and $0.5200.
