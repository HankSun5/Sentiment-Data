Despite recent market stagnation, the analyst highlights several key factors—including the application of Elliott Wave theory—that suggest a significant upward movement is imminent. Why XRP Looks Still ‘Super Bullish’ According to Dark Defender, the XRP price is currently determined by three trend lines. Two of these trend lines form a symmetrical triangle pattern, while the third—a downward-sloping orange line—represents a long-term downtrend that XRP has recently broken above on the monthly chart. Related Reading: Bollinger Bands Indicate XRP Price Surge Ahead Despite SEC Challenges: Expert The symmetrical triangle, formed by two converging trendlines, shows a 4-year long period of consolidation. This pattern is generally considered a continuation pattern, meaning that the price is likely to continue in the direction of the existing trend upon breakout. In XRP’s case, the price has tried to break to the upside several times – thus far without success. The third trendline, the downward-sloping orange line, has been acting as a significant resistance level for XRP since summer 2021. The fact that XRP has broken above this long-term downtrend line on the monthly chart is a strong bullish signal. This breakout suggests a shift in market sentiment from bearish to bullish, potentially leading to substantial price appreciation. Integral to Dark Defender’s analysis is the application of Elliott Wave theory to XRP’s price action. The chart shared by the analyst displays an Elliott Wave count that suggests XRP is poised to enter a Wave 3 impulse move, historically the most powerful and extended wave in the five-wave trend sequence. In this context, the analyst believes that XRP has completed Wave 2—a corrective phase characterized by downward price movement—and is now embarking on Wave 3. This wave is often marked by strong momentum and increased market participation, potentially explaining the anticipated surge above $5.85. The projected target aligns with Fibonacci extension levels commonly associated with Wave 3 movements, providing a technical basis for the significant price increase. In the short term, the 70.2% Fibonacci price level at $0.6649 is the most crucial resistance for XRP. If this barrier breaks, wave 3 could be confirmed. A first major extension target would be the 161.8% Fibonacci level at $1.88. The ultimate target could be the 261.8% Fibonacci level at $5.85. Related Reading: XRP Macro Charts Signal Explosive Bullish Move Despite SEC Appeal: Analyst The analyst also points out that the Heikin Ashi candles are currently averaging at $0.57 on the monthly chart. “When Heikin Ashi Candles (average-price candles, currently at $0.57) are considered, the monthly average price stays above the support level, which is critical for XRP to continue the momentum,” Dark Defender notes. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator on the monthly timeframe has printed a green dot, a bullish signal suggesting increasing upward momentum. The MACD is a momentum oscillator that helps traders identify potential trend reversals. A green dot typically signifies that the MACD line has crossed above the signal line, indicating a positive shift in momentum. Ultimately, Dark Defender contends that XRP’s price action is largely independent of external news events, including developments related to the SEC lawsuit against Ripple. While acknowledging that such news can have a minor impact, the analyst argues that technical patterns and indicators hold more sway over XRP’s movements. “As most expected, nothing happened after the appeal decision. XRP just were at the Ichimoku clouds top around $0.60+ levels and bounced back from there to $0.50+. I am Bullish; why? As I always highlight, XRP does not follow any news such as SEC. OK, they have a minor impact, but that’s it,” Dark Defender notes. Based on the technical factors outlined—including the breakout above the long-term downtrend line, the significance of the symmetrical triangle, the importance of the Heikin Ashi monthly average price, bullish signals from the MACD, and the Elliott Wave count—Dark Defender is “super bullish” on XRP. The analyst anticipates that the asset will follow historical patterns leading to a price exceeding $5.85. At press time, XRP traded at $0.53.

Following a dramatic series of price swings—first a 27% surge, then a 20% retrace, then a 10% rise, and now a 7% dip to $0.34—Cardano finds itself at one of its most critical support levels. Holding this level is essential for bulls to maintain momentum and avoid a deeper decline. Related Reading: Dogecoin Analyst Expects A ‘Multi-Year Bullish Breakout’ – 200% Surge Potential Market data from Coinglass indicates that ADA may be entering a consolidation phase, often preceding a significant price move. Investors and traders closely watch this level, as it could determine whether Cardano is poised for a bullish breakout or a deeper correction. With the entire crypto market in a state of anticipation, ADA’s upcoming price action will be key in signaling its next trend. As sentiment remains mixed, this consolidation period will likely set the tone for Cardano’s direction in the coming weeks. Cardano Funding Rate Suggests Market Consolidation Cardano (ADA) is showing signs of entering a potential consolidation phase, a crucial moment for investors as they evaluate the next move. Recent on-chain data highlights a surge in large transactions followed by stabilization, suggesting that the market is cooling off after weeks of volatility. This stabilization could pave the way for more balanced price action as ADA hovers around a key support level. Coinglass data further reinforces the consolidation narrative. The ADA Open Interest (OI)-Weighted Funding Rate has declined yet remains positive. A declining but positive funding rate indicates that demand for ADA is slowing down, but not to a degree where the market expects heavy short-selling. In crypto, when funding rates dip but stay in positive territory, the market consolidates rather than preparing for a sharp downward movement. This suggests that while ADA’s upward momentum has slowed, there isn’t yet an overwhelming bearish sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Failed Attempt To Break $64,000 Could Lead To A Disaster – Analyst If ADA manages to hold above current levels during this consolidation phase, it would signal healthy price action. The key is whether bulls can defend these levels, potentially leading to a more sustained rally in the weeks ahead. Investors must monitor these indicators closely as the market tests ADA’s resilience. ADA Testing Crucial Support Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.34 after failing to reclaim two critical levels: the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) at $0.356 and the 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $0.359. These indicators are crucial for ADA to regain bullish momentum, and their rejection signals potential weakness in the price action. Despite this, ADA is still holding above a key support level at $0.34. If this level is lost, the price could face a significant retracement, with lower demand levels around $0.32 and potentially $0.30 being tested. This makes the $0.34 support critical for maintaining current market sentiment. Conversely, if ADA can reclaim the 4-hour 200 MA and 200 EMA, breaking above $0.36, it could set the stage for a rally toward higher resistance levels. The next significant supply zone to watch would be around $0.41, where further bullish momentum could face its next challenge. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Reclaim $2,700 As Key Data Signals Reduced Selling Pressure The coming days will be pivotal for ADA as it consolidates and prepares for its next move.
