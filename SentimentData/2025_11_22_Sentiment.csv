Alex insists that Palantir is “the most important software company in America and therefore in the world.” That claim came as he confronted renewed criticism over Palantir’s role in government systems capable of linking tax files, biometric information, and personal records. Palantir software powers deportations, drones, and NHS Questions over whether Alex is the “scariest CEO in the world” resurfaced after his media appearances. Some point to Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Peter Thiel as competition, but trust me, Alex brings his own entirely different eccentric style to the party. Viewers saw him speak at rapid speed, shake both fists on CNBC’s Squawk Box and demand to know why short sellers were targeting Palantir when its stock had climbed almost 600% in a year. “It’s super triggering,” he said. “Why do they have to go after us?” Palantir’s influence reaches across the US government. Its AI tools help ICE carry out deportations, support the Pentagon’s drone program and guide police departments in their crime-prediction work. Outside the US, its software supports the Israel Defense Forces in Gaza, assists Ukrainian forces in their defense against Russia and is used by police and corporations in Europe and beyond. In the UK, Labour’s military and NHS modernization plans rely heavily on Palantir systems. When Keir Starmer visited Washington in February, his first stop after the White House was Palantir’s office, where Alex showed him military technology. A new biography titled The Philosopher in the Valley , written by journalist Michael Steinberger, outlines Alex’s personality in detail. Steinberger writes that “fear is something that really drives him” and describes Palantir as “the embodiment, in a lot of ways, of Karp.” He says Alex built the company around his personal view of the world and his own need for security. Steinberger found Alex contradictory, intense, and shaped by a past that still affects him today. Anyway, Alex earned $6.8 billion in 2024 and owns roughly 20 homes, many designed like sparse ski huts. He calls Palantir “an artists’ colony” and compares himself to Larry David, joking once that his style of humor “might be called Karp Your Enthusiasm.” Alex’s weird political evolution Alex met Peter Thiel in law school at Stanford, where the two connected despite opposing views. Thiel later co-founded PayPal with Elon Musk, while Alex went to Frankfurt to pursue a PhD in social theory. As a Jew, Steinberger writes, Alex wanted to understand “how Germany… descended into barbarism.” When he reconnected with Thiel in 2004 and joined Palantir, he couldn’t code but understood ontology, how information is organized. He persuaded engineers and researchers to join him and pushed the company toward work that other tech firms avoided. Palantir’s mission centered on “defending the west” from the beginning. While tech giants avoided military contracts, Palantir embraced them. Its tools supported the US military in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the company sued the Army in 2016 over blocked contracts. Palantir was connected to the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018, and during the pandemic, its software tracked virus spread and vaccine allocation, while today it works with the CIA, FBI, DHS, NSA, ICE and other federal agencies. Steinberger argues that people misunderstand what Palantir actually does, arguing that Alex does not collect or store people’s data but builds software that lets others use their own data. Politically, Alex is hard to pin down. He opposed Donald Trump in 2016, voted for Hillary Clinton and backed Kamala Harris in 2024. But once Trump returned to the White House, Alex adjusted. He wrote a $1 million inauguration check, and Palantir gave $5 million to Trump’s military parade. In an interview with Axios, he called himself “an independent who admires what Trump has done on many things.” Steinberger said Alex believes that “the price of doing business with the government is making nice with Trump.” Critics say this contradicts Alex’s past warnings about fascism, especially since Palantir’s tools aid ICE in street arrests that sometimes include innocent people. Steinberger said Alex rejects the idea that Trump is fascist and argues that the US still has a working court system and free press. Steinberger added that Alex claims Palantir prevented “innumerable terror attacks” in Europe. On immigration, Alex argues that “if the left doesn’t take this concern seriously, voters are going to turn to people who do, and the left isn’t going to like the outcome. That’s how you got the first Trump presidency, and arguably it’s one of the reasons you got the second one.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

According to Arkham data, a total of $7.5 million worth of cryptocurrency was transferred to different wallets in the last 24 hours. Authorities transferred $300,000 worth of NEXO, $3 million worth of WETH, and $4.2 million worth of TRX in the last 24 hours. The NEXO and TRX assets were reportedly seized two years ago as part of Alameda Research investigations, while the WETH reportedly came from cryptocurrencies seized between 2022 and 2024 in the Bitfinex hacker Ilya Lichtenstein case.

The token remains priced at only $0.035, but demand has been extreme to an extent that its current stage is nearing a sell out. It is emerging as one of the most successful projects in the new crypto and DeFi crypto categories as more investors observe early-stage projects entering Q4 2025. The question most investors are currently raising is how come the support of the project is taking off so fast. Developing a Dual-Lending DeFi System Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating a two-sided lending organization that is lender-borrower-based. It has passive-yield tools, risk controls and automatic functions, which maintain stability in the lending markets. mtTokens is one of the internal characteristics. Users get to receive mtTokens when they provide their assets. These tokens monitor deposits and allow one to realize yield with time. Using the example of the user, who provides his assets worth $1,000, the value of his mtTokens will keep rising with the accrual of interests in the liquidity pool. Mutuum Finance also involves the borrowing markets which have variable and stable rates. Borrowers abide by straight LTV regulations, and all positions are liquidated via automated procedures using smart contracts. In case the value of collateral becomes too low, the liquidation bot will intervene in an attempt to stabilize the loan. This helps in minimizing risks throughout the protocol as well as contributing to reliability in the long-run. Mutuum Finance operates on a buy-distribute channel. The one part of the protocol revenue purchases MUTM on the market and reinvests it into users that stake mtTokens on the safety module. This generates stable token demand that is associated with platform activity but not hype. Security has too been a concern. Mutuum Finance underwent the CertiK audit with a high score of the 90/100 Token Scan score and a bug bounty of $50k that targets the vulnerability of its code. Presale Momentum Mutuum finance is currently conducting one of the most vibrant offerings of tokens within the top crypto initiatives below $1. The presale has already raised approximately $18.8M, as well as established a community of more than 18,000 holders. The pre-sale was launched at the start of 2025, with the token being issued at the low price of $0.01. It has since risen to the current $0.035 that is 250% higher than in the initial stage. The present stage is already about 90% allocated in which we can see that the buyers are rapidly buying The 24-hour leaderboard also helps to support demand. This element will award the best daily buyer $500 of MUTM, and enhance the activity and interest in every day of presale. Card payments are also available at Mutuum finance, and this will have more participants joining the ecosystem with less dependency on crypto transfer. V1 Launch in Q4 2025 The team affirmed that the Mutuum Finance V1 protocol would exist in the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. The basic elements of the lending system (a liquidity pool, issuing of mtTokens) are present in this first version, as well as the debt tokens and the liquidation bot, which are supported by ETH and USDT as supply and borrow and collateral assets. This change of building to testing is important. Mutuum Finance is already on the step of users interacting with the product. The transitioning of theory into actual performance is where the interest of the investor is more likely to rise. Together with an already established CertiK audit and an open bug bounty, the protocol demonstrates that security was the key focus of the design. Growth Drivers In future steps, Mutuum Finance also has plans of USD-pegged stable-coin. According to many analysts, this will be able to bolster long-term value since stablecoins provide consistent demand, liquidity and real utility within lending markets. It is also on the roadmap to expand layer-2. Expanding into several chains has the potential to increase the number of users and subsequently cost a column on transactions, which offers an expansion opportunity to MUTM. According to these characteristics, there are analysts of MUTM that say MUTM’s price could increase many times more than it did before sales, when V1 is launched and its demand with the help of real protocols usage grows. Whale Interest Building As Phase 6 approaches being 100% allocated, the window at the current price of $0.035 is being closed rapidly. The increase of investors is continuing to rise and the involvement of whales has been rising as major milestones are reached by the project. This is a mix of fast presale gains, high utility design, back of the security and a guarantee of V1 release that has placed Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as one of the most highly anticipated new crypto-tokens under $0.05.

After a period of decisive movements, the market now finds itself in a state where previous directional force has largely dissipated, allowing for a re-evaluation of its path. A Necessary Reset Before Bitcoin’s Next Big Push In an X post, Swissblock has mentioned that Bitcoin momentum is clearly in a reset phase, and the question now is how long until it flips. Historically, in late February to early April 2025, the bottom required roughly 7 weeks for a full momentum to reset. Moving further back to late June to late September 2024, the correction took close to 14 weeks for a full reset and consolidation before a clear trend emerged. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bear Market Confirmed? Expert Predicts Price Target Of $40,000 By Late 2026 Data shows that the current momentum reset has been underway for weeks, placing BTC right inside the window where past cycles have typically reached exhaustion. This zone historically marks the point where downside pressure weakens and the higher probability of a counter-trend move increases sharply. The crypto market is collapsing. An industry-leading commentary on the global capital markets, The Kobeissi Letter, revealed that on October 6th, just 45 days ago, Bitcoin touched an all-time high of $126,272, with the total crypto market capitalization reaching $2.5 trillion. However, everything changed on October 10th, when President Donald Trump threatened 100% tariffs on China, shifting the surface of the crypto market. This announcement triggered a chain reaction record of $19.2 billion in liquidations, the highest ever recorded in a single event, and BTC never truly recovered from the shock. Even when a trade deal between the US and China was reached on October 30th, the liquidation pressures only worsened. Since November 10th, BTC price action has moved into a literal straight line lower, with average daily liquidations approaching $1 billion. Throughout this entire 45-day bear market, there has been an absence of bearish fundamental developments within the crypto space. Kobeissi concluded that this is a mechanical bear market driven by an excessive level of leverage and sporadic liquidations, claiming the market is efficient, and it will iron itself out. Will BTC Emerge Stronger From This Test? This current Bitcoin correction has now fallen perfectly in line with the previous major drawdowns of this cycle. A full-time crypto trader and investor, Daan Crypto Trades, highlighted that each of these corrections in the ongoing cycle has their own story, but this one is hitting the market the hardest.

He outlined an upcoming shift in how the cryptocurrency will be accessed , pointing to a future where the altcoin is obtained only through institutional products. Why Buying XRP Could Become Impossible In The Future On Thursday, Van Code announced via an X post that XRP is on track to become inaccessible for direct retail purchase as the market transitions toward institutionally controlled vehicles. He predicts that within a couple of years, major custodians will hold nearly all native XRP, leaving retail investors to gain exposure only through ETFs or bank-managed market marker style products. The market expert ties this outlook to a broader 15-year roadmap he believes is steadily unfolding and expected to reach completion by 2030. He described a future in which XRP would eventually be held mainly by major custodians acting on behalf of banks , fund managers, and other large financial entities. According to him, retail investors would interact with XRP only through products managed by these institutions rather than holding the asset in their own wallets. Van Code also projected that the altcoin could become a wholesale token used strictly for settlement, custody, and transfers between financial institutions. In this model, the majority of retail market participation could shift away from the cryptocurrency itself, instead relying on ETF products that track its performance without granting direct ownership . He referred to this potential evolution as the endgame for both the XRP Ledger and its native token, XRP. He also stressed that many holders have not fully grasped the scale of this potentially ongoing transition or the significance of the token they hold. Where To Store Your Coins Ahead Of The Transition Following Van Code’s prediction, a crypto community member asked where XRP should be held ahead of these potential market changes, noting conflicting advice on exchanges, cold wallets, and possible bank custody. Van Code responded by outlining the strengths and weaknesses of each option. He stated that crypto exchanges offer simplicity for users with limited technical knowledge but require trust that the platform remains solvent. On the other hand, cold wallets provide complete control and ownership of private keys but introduce higher risks of user error, permanent loss, and estate-planning complications. Van Code noted that ETFs are likely the safest option from a security and inheritance standpoint because they rely on established stock-register infrastructure with bank-grade protection and compliance. However, they come with fees , may not allow conversion back to native XRP, and could trigger capital gain taxes if a holder sells their existing tokens to buy into an ETF. Ultimately, the market expert explained that the best place to store XRP depends on the holders’ comfort level, technical knowledge, discipline in managing seed phrases, and the amount of tokens held.

54724913,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=866082,1763762528,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54724913.jpeg,Trump is considering allowing Nvidia to export H200 chips to China,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-chinas-xi-jinping-nvidias-h200-chips/,"Donald Trump is now seriously discussing whether to allow Nvidia to send its H200 artificial intelligence chips to China, despite U.S. restrictions that were put in place three years ago. According to Bloomberg, conversations inside the White House have already begun. Trump’s aides have been weighing whether to issue export licenses that would allow Nvidia’s chips, used to train massive AI systems, to reach Chinese firms again. Nothing’s been finalized, but the fact that these talks are happening at all is a major reversal from earlier policies. This debate comes as Trump looks for potential openings with Xi Jinping. Last month, he met with the Chinese leader but didn’t formally bring up Nvidia’s latest chips. That said, people involved in the follow-up say U.S. officials have kept the door open. Discussions are now centered on what type of processors could be sold, without putting what Trump’s team sees as national security at risk. Trump officials push H200 over Blackwell The H200 chip is stronger than the current H20 model allowed in China but is still based on Nvidia’s older Hopper design. The Blackwell line, which is used in the U.S., remains banned. By letting China buy the H200, the administration could offer a middle option, something more powerful than the current legal ceiling but not America’s top-tier chips. Trump’s Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said recently that he could imagine sending Blackwell chips to China, but only once they’re outdated. “Maybe in a year or two,” Bessent told lawmakers. Five months ago, he had said the administration had “no intent” to expand China’s access to advanced semiconductors and confirmed they had even blocked the weaker H20 , something the Biden White House didn’t do. Then weeks later, the U.S. quietly greenlit shipments of the H20 in return for a 15% cut of revenue, an informal deal with no formal legal agreement behind it. Officials at the time said it was part of a wider trade deal with China for rare-earth minerals. But six people familiar with the deal in London allegedly said there was no such trade deal. China’s Commerce Ministry said it approved rare-earth exports because the U.S. had lifted other restrictions, and separately acknowledged the H20 license approval. Howard Lutnick, Trump’s Commerce Secretary, defended the H20 exports by saying, “They’ll get addicted to our tech,” and that it wouldn’t hurt the U.S. because they weren’t selling China the most advanced chips, “not our best stuff, not our second-best stuff, not even our third-best.” Beijing rejects Nvidia’s limited chips, but still wants access Despite Washington’s green light, Beijing told its companies not to buy the H20 or another China-specific Nvidia product. China’s government has been pushing its firms to adopt domestic hardware from players like Huawei, even though most tech companies in the country still want Nvidia’s chips. The local alternatives are weaker and harder to scale. Nvidia, for its part, has been pushing back on U.S. policy. In a statement, it said the restrictions “leave that massive market to our rapidly growing foreign competitors.” The company also said, “Our foreclosure from the China data center compute market has no impact on our ability to supply customers in the USA.” CEO Jensen Huang has been meeting with U.S. officials trying to reverse the restrictions. This internal fight has also reached Congress. A bipartisan group of senators is now writing legislation that would force the Commerce Department to deny all current license applications for advanced chips to China. If that bill passes, the Trump administration’s entire H200 plan would be dead. The White House and Commerce have refused to comment on whether they support H200 exports. But Trump’s team is still debating the best move. Some aides see the H200 as a reasonable middle ground, better than the watered-down chips already available in China, but far behind Blackwell. Others inside the administration want no additional chips sold at all. Lawmakers on both sides agree that too many exports could give China an edge in artificial intelligence.

Dara, 36, formally launched his campaign on Thursday, announcing he will seek the Republican nomination to unseat Democratic incumbent Letitia James. Lawfare isn’t just wrong – it’s costly. I’m running for Attorney General to end lawfare, enforce the law, and create a better business climate in New York to tackle the affordability crisis. Join the fight. Donate today. https://t.co/GhQIuwvIM3 pic.twitter.com/n8Fynf6esq — Khurram Dara (@KhurramDara) November 20, 2025 His message centers on ending what he calls “lawfare,” the use of legal actions as political weapons, and reversing years of aggressive crypto enforcement under James’s leadership. Ex-Coinbase Lawyer Says James’ Crypto Crackdowns Are Pushing Businesses Out of New York Dara has been showing his political ambitions since August, often criticizing James’ approach as harmful to innovation and the state’s business climate. He argues that New York’s regulatory environment has driven companies, investment, and jobs elsewhere, while contributing to rising costs that residents are struggling to manage. “I’ve seen the cost of lawfare firsthand,” he said during a recent interview. “It drives up the cost of doing business, erodes trust in government, and makes New York less affordable at a time when people are already stretched.” New York needs an Attorney General that will enforce the law, not politicize it. That’s why I’m running. Join the fight. Donate today: https://t.co/GhQIuwvIM3 pic.twitter.com/TFCAQ7PCda — Khurram Dara (@KhurramDara) November 21, 2025 The former Coinbase lawyer brings a long résumé from inside the crypto regulatory world. Until July, he served as the regulatory and policy principal at Bain Capital Crypto, the digital assets arm of the global investment firm. He previously held positions at Fluidity and AirSwap before joining Coinbase in 2022, just as the exchange faced an SEC investigation that would help define the Biden-era crackdown on crypto. He often credits that period with shaping his views on what he sees as unchecked regulatory overreach. Letitia James, who has held office since 2019, has built a national profile through high-profile cases involving Donald Trump, the NRA, and Andrew Cuomo. But she has also made crypto enforcement a central part of her agenda. Her office has brought actions against Gemini, Tether, Digital Currency Group, Genesis, KuCoin, NovaTech, and Galaxy Digital. One of her biggest cases, the 2023 lawsuit against Gemini , Genesis, and DCG, resulted in the return of about $50 million to Gemini Earn users and a broader settlement that effectively shut Genesis’ lending operations in New York. Her critics argue that she has stretched the boundaries of the Martin Act, a century-old law that grants the state broad authority to investigate financial misconduct. Source: Journal of Business & Technology Law NY’s 2026 Ballot Gains Another Crypto-Aligned Candidate as Dara Steps In Dara’s platform calls for limiting how the Act is used and ending contingency-fee deals with private law firms, which allow outside attorneys to take a share of recovered funds. He argues that these arrangements can encourage overly aggressive litigation and turn major enforcement decisions into a form of political theater. His campaign also touches broader statewide concerns, echoing themes from recent local races, including those raised by Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, who won on a message centered on affordability. @ZohranKMamdani has been elected as New York City’s next mayor, marking a notable win for crypto prediction markets. #Mamdani #Crypto https://t.co/UGbQ5fFNBQ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 5, 2025 Dara says ending regulatory excess and streamlining oversight would help lower costs for businesses and ultimately consumers. Political forces around the race are beginning to shift. Some New York business leaders publicly welcomed Dara’s announcement, pointing to heightened uncertainty after the city’s recent mayoral election. “It is encouraging to see a candidate with a pro-business, pro-innovation approach who could help restore confidence in our great city,” said Keith Grossman, president of MoonPay. James is expected to seek a third term despite facing new political headwinds, including federal charges last month alleging mortgage fraud connected to a property in Virginia, charges she has pleaded not guilty to and described as politically motivated. The state’s 2026 political field is also beginning to show more crypto-aligned candidates. John Deaton, the attorney known for representing XRP holders in the SEC’s case against Ripple, recently announced he will again run as a Republican, this time challenging Senator Ed Markey in Massachusetts after losing his 2024 bid against Elizabeth Warren. Crypto attorney John Deaton is running for the U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts again, but hasn't mentioned any pro-crypto policies in his campaign. #JohnDeaton #CryptoLawyer #MassachusettsSenateRace https://t.co/vNoEGNTp6q — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 12, 2025 Crypto’s growing political footprint suggests the issue will be central in several 2026 races, but nowhere more so than New York, home to Wall Street, a major share of U.S. crypto companies, and the country’s toughest digital-asset rules. Under state nominating laws, Dara will need either 25% of the vote at the GOP convention in February or enough petition signatures to enter the primary. His only declared Republican opponent so far is Michael Henry, the party’s 2022 nominee.

The conversation focused on why the pardon was granted, how the process worked, and the many rumors circulating online. Guillén Addresses Public Controversy The lawyer explained that CZ was accused of failing to implement proper anti-money laundering programs and compliance systems at Binance, but emphasized that this was a regulatory issue, not a criminal offence, and that no illegal activity had taken place. “He was pardoned because he should not have been prosecuted in the first place,” she said, adding that the pardon statement from President Trump proved that he had not committed any crime. Guillén described CZ as the only individual ever prosecuted for such regulatory violations, noting that this treatment was inconsistent with how executives at large financial institutions are typically handled. She also believes that the Binance founder became a target in what she described as part of regulators’ “war on crypto,” particularly in the aftermath of the FTX collapse. Explaining the pardon process, the legal professional said applications usually undergo extensive review by multiple offices, including the Department of Justice, the Office of the Pardon Attorney, and the White House Counsel, before the president makes the final decision. She rejected claims of a “quid pro quo” or corruption, describing such speculation as based on misinterpretations and unverified sources. The attorney also addressed misunderstandings regarding CZ’s business relationships, including links to firms like World Liberty Financial, clarifying that these connections have been widely misread. Guillén added that political statements, such as those made by Senator Elizabeth Warren, were inaccurate and showed how much influence public officials have over perception. Zhao’s Return to Binance Guillén has also confirmed that Zhao will not return to the company at this time, as Binance continues to operate under restrictions from multiple U.S. agencies, including the Department of JUSTICE (DOJ), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and the Treasury Department. She explained that these measures remain in place despite the absence of fraud, victims, or a criminal record, limiting Binance’s operations in the U.S. market. The lawyer concluded that while the pardon clarified the accusations against CZ, the broader consequences have affected him and the exchange, while the U.S has lost access to the liquidity and opportunities that come from hosting one of the world’s largest crypto platforms. Meanwhile, she also praised Zhao for remaining calm and positive throughout the ordeal, saying that he handled media scrutiny and public criticism with composure.

The crypto sector has endured a string of sharp pullbacks over the past month as overleveraged positions were wiped out. Bitcoin is now hovering above $85,000, marking a seven-month low. Still, the broader outlook isn’t entirely bleak. Blockchain technology continues to advance, and XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin remain some of crypto’s most resilient long-term players, so there are optimistic scenarios for them in a recovery cycle. Here’s how Gemini AI projects the situation could evolve as the holiday season approaches. XRP (XRP): Gemini AI Predicts a Slump Down to $1 Next Month Gemini AI’s predictive models indicate that Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could slump to around $1 by Christmas, a drop of roughly 50% from its current price near $2. Source: Gemini AI Such a decline would be a dramatic reversal for Ripple’s flagship token, which surged to a seven-year peak of $3.65 in July following Ripple’s major courtroom victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Over the past year, XRP has climbed 70%, outperforming both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Technically, XRP has been trading within a tight consolidation channel for months, repeatedly forming bullish flag setups that have failed to break upward. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) uptrending to 40, XRP is no longer oversold, and some buying momentum could lead to a weekend recovery and stabilisation. However, Gemini AI also outlines a more bullish alternative. A strong move upward could be triggered by this week’s US SEC approval of the 9 XRP spot ETF, which can generate substantial inflows if Bitcoin and Ethereum’s history are anything to go by. Furthermore, large-scale institutional partnerships or favorable U.S. regulatory developments could push XRP to reach $5 to $10 by 2026. Pi Network (PI): Gemini AI Sees a Sudden Rebound and Fast Growth Pi Network ($PI) is unique for its mobile mining system that rewards users with crypto for daily tapping. Now priced around $0.23, PI has risen 8.5% over the past week, highlighting its resilience. However, Gemini AI forecasts a bear market scenario where Pi sinks to $0.04. The alternative trajectory in a bull market is over 100x that figure, possibly reaching $4.34. After a prolonged downtrend following its debut, November appears to be at a turning point. Recent momentum may be tied to Pi Network’s partnership with AI startup OpenMind, which demonstrated that node operators can provide computational services for external enterprises, a groundbreaking use case for blockchain networks. The Pi testnet has also added support for decentralized exchanges, automated market makers, liquidity tools, and a more advanced KYC system, all of which significantly expand the ecosystem’s practical utility. Ethereum (ETH): Gemini AI Projects a Rally Toward $15,000 Ethereum ($ETH) , the core infrastructure powering decentralized apps, smart contracts, and much of modern DeFi, continues to dominate Web3 development. With a market cap above $332 billion and more than $64.5 billion in total value locked in its DeFi protocols, Ethereum remains crypto’s leading programmable network. Gemini AI anticipates that ETH could drop 37% from its current price of $2,799 to $1,763 by the end of the year if current bearishness persists. However, Ethereum’s strong security profile, reliable settlement layer, and commanding role in stablecoins and real-world asset tokenization position it to benefit from institutional inflows should US regulators deliver their long-promised comprehensive crypto legislation. ETH currently faces heavy resistance in the upper $4,000 range. In Gemin’s bull-case scenario, achieving a breakout above this ceiling could pave the way for a new all-time high anywhere between $5,000 and $12,300 by Christmas. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A Rising Meme Coin Outside Gemini AI’s Purview Even in a declining market, capital continues flowing into presales, where traders hunt for low-priced tokens with high upside potential. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is emerging as one of the most intriguing new contenders. The project has already raised nearly $4.2 million in its presale, combining classic Dogecoin-style humor with a modern, energy-efficient blockchain foundation. According to its lore, Maxi Doge spent the early days of crypto watching Dogecoin succeed while he trained in his mother’s basement, aiming to become a top-tier degen. Today, MAXI emphasizes community participation through viral challenges, meme contests, and a strong social media identity. Built on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, MAXI benefits from the network’s scalability, low environmental impact, and large developer ecosystem, advantages that the older, proof-of-work Dogecoin lacks. The token has a total supply of 150.24 billion, with 25% allocated to a “Maxi Fund” intended for marketing and ecosystem growth. Staking rewards currently offer up to 74% APY, though rates decrease as more users join. The presale price begins today at $0.000269, with scheduled increases across later stages. Investors can participate using MetaMask or Best Wallet . Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages.

54725385,https://cryptonews.com/?p=454754,1763764500,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/54725385.jpeg,"Best Crypto to Buy Now 21 November – XRP, Solana, PEPE",https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-21-november-xrp-solana-pepe/,"After briefly touching a record peak of $126,080 on October 6, Bitcoin has spent the past few weeks steadily slipping lower. Now trading around $83,814, the asset has dropped to its lowest level in six months and appears to be in freefall. Even with the retreat, some seasoned market watchers remain unfazed, describing the pullback as a typical market cycle, flushing out excess leverage and easing speculative trading after months of rapid accumulation. In this argument, these bear cycles create a stronger base for the next bull run. At the same time, a new narrative is emerging: Bitcoin may not be the main catalyst of the approaching bull cycle. With that in mind, here’s why XRP, Solana, and Pepe may be the best cryptos to buy at the current discount. XRP (XRP): Positioned to Power a New Global Payments Standard Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) continues to attract attention across the fintech world thanks to its fast, low-cost settlement protocol, technology Ripple argues could eventually serve as a more efficient replacement to SWIFT. XRP has appeared in digital finance reports from the UN Capital Development Fund and the White House, reinforcing its reputation as a top-tier payments asset. Ripple’s expanding partnerships with banks and global payment providers have helped XRP sustain its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of over $116 billion. Ripple’s rollout of RLUSD, a U.S. dollar–backed stablecoin, highlights its broader ambitions in the payments arena. Each RLUSD transaction on Ripple’s ledger burns a small quantity of XRP, linking long-term token value directly to network activity. XRP has climbed 70% over the past year, reaching a new all-time high of $3.65 in July, its first in six years. Over the same period, Bitcoin slipped 14%. With its Relative Strength Index near 31, XRP is a little oversold, which will draw bargain buyers, particularly at its current price of $1.94, a steal for those who believe in the project’s longevity. The launch of nine XRP ETFs this week could spark a dramatic reversal. Additionally, if regulators move ahead with Project Crypto, the proposed national digital asset framework, analysts suggest XRP could aim for $10 or more by 2026. Solana (SOL): Ethereum’s Toughest Rival Eyes a Run Toward $1,000 Solana ($SOL) has quickly become one of the fastest and most scalable smart-contract ecosystems in crypto. With a market capitalization above $71 billion and nearly $9 billion in total value locked across its DeFi network, Solana stands firmly as Ethereum’s strongest competitor. The introduction of Solana spot ETFs from Grayscale and Bitwise on the NYSE earlier this year opened the door for significant institutional inflows, an event that previously fueled major rallies in both Bitcoin and Ethereum. SOL bottomed around $100 earlier this year. At its current price of $128, it’s perilously close to bottoming again. Technical analysts highlight a bullish flag pattern forming since mid-September, with its current level emerging as a key support zone and heavier resistance anticipated around $250. A decisive breakout above that region could send SOL beyond its record high of $293.31, with some projecting a possible run toward $750 during a strong Q4 cycle. Solana’s combination of low fees and high speed continues to attract Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization initiatives, with major firms such as Franklin Templeton and BlackRock utilizing its technology. Pepe (PEPE): The Frog Meme Aiming for a Fresh All-Time High Launched in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) quickly captured the collective imagination of the crypto community, drawing inspiration from Matt Furie’s iconic character from the Boy’s Club webcomic. Now valued at more than $1.7 billion, PEPE has reached global meme-coin status. Even Dogecoin/Bitcoin holder Elon Musk briefly adopted the Pepe meme as his X profile photo, sparking widespread speculation about his holdings across social media. Currently trading at about $0.000004255, the token sits roughly 85% below its late-2024 peak of $0.00002803, weighed down by a slow summer and 2025’s “Downtober” slump. Pepe currently holds an RSI near 31, indicating the likelihood of an accumulation cycle over the weekend, though it trades at its lowest point for nearly a year and eight months. Still, if US regulators deliver securities policy reform to cater to crypto companies, a market reversal and risk-on appetite could push PEPE beyond its previous record before year-end. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): Meme Branding Meets High-Speed Bitcoin Layer-2 Tech A rising star heading into 2026 is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a Bitcoin layer-2 solution packaged as a meme coin. Despite its playful aesthetic, the project is serious in its aims to enhance Bitcoin with fast throughput, low fees, and full smart-contract support. Running on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), the network features decentralized governance and a Canonical Bridge that enables rapid, secure Bitcoin transfers across blockchains. The HYPER presale has already generated more than $28.25 million. Popular analyst Borch Crypto has suggested the token could yield returns up to 100×. A recent audit by Coinsult revealed no smart-contract vulnerabilities, further boosting confidence in the project. HYPER powers transaction fees, governance, and staking, with early presale buyers earning yields of up to 41% APY. Bitcoin is going HYPER in 2026!

Washington couple were involved in Tesla accident The accident reportedly involved a Tesla Model 3 in January 2023, resulting in a fiery crash that left the car so damaged that rescuers allegedly had a difficult time prying open the vehicle’s doors. The couple, Jeffery Dennis and his wife, Wendy, had been running errands on that Saturday afternoon in the Model 3 sedan when it “suddenly and rapidly accelerated out of control,” coming to a stop after it ran into a utility pole, after which it burst into flames, according to the suit, which was filed on Friday. The complaint blames Tesla’s “unique and defective door handle design” for rendering the doors inoperable and impeding the rescue process. This led to Wendy Dennis dying at the scene, and Jeffery Dennis suffering injuries, including burns to his legs. “Several bystanders ran to the vehicle and attempted to assist Jeff and Wendy Dennis, but the Model 3’s door handles would not operate,” the couple’s lawyers said in the lawsuit. “Several good Samaritans even attempted to use a baseball bat to break the car windows to help the Dennisses out of the burning vehicle.” The lawsuit accuses Tesla of negligence and misleading customers, claiming that Elon Musk’s company knew the door handles could become inoperable after a crash and was aware of fire hazards from the lithium-ion battery pack, but did nothing to address either issue. It also alleges that the Model 3 the couple had been driving had a defect that caused the sudden acceleration out of control, and that the automatic emergency braking system failed. Tesla’s door design has been targeted in lawsuits Tesla vehicles come with two built-in batteries: one for low-voltage power that controls interior functions like windows, doors, and the touchscreen, and the high-voltage pack that propels the car. Should the low-voltage battery die or be disabled, which is possible after a serious crash, the doors may not unlock and must be opened manually from the inside. Unfortunately, while Teslas come with manual releases, many owners and passengers reportedly don’t know where they are located or how to operate them. The problem is snowballing into a huge crisis, which has forced the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to start investigating whether some Tesla doors are defective, citing incidents in which exterior handles stopped working and trapped children and other occupants inside. Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla’s design chief, has said the company is working on a redesign of its door handles to make them more intuitive for occupants “in a panic situation.” However, that has not happened yet, and news of Tesla mishaps continues to filter in. The issue has even drawn the attention of Bloomberg’s news investigation team, which also reported there have been incidents in which people were seriously injured or died after they were unable to open doors following a loss of power, particularly after crashes. The latest lawsuit comes weeks after one was filed against Tesla in Wisconsin after a Model S crash killed five occupants who allegedly became trapped in a fast-moving inferno because the doors wouldn’t budge. Separately, Tesla was sued in October due to alleged defects in the doors of a crashed Cybertruck in Piedmont, California, that turned it into a “death trap” that prevented three college students from escaping before they died of smoke inhalation. Then in July, a lawsuit was filed on behalf of the sole survivor of a Tesla crash in Murrieta, California, in which three teenagers died. Despite the mounting cases, authorities have been slow on the uptake as far as the U.S. is concerned; however, in other countries, officials have been moving to remedy the problem. In China, a top regulator is reportedly considering a ban on fully concealed door handles, while in Europe, they have taken incremental measures to improve post-crash rescue and extrication protocols.

The publicly traded company informed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it suspended CEO Peter Tassiopoulos effective October 16, despite an internal email that reportedly revealed that the board placed him on temporary leave on September 4. That discrepancy is what securities law experts say could have violated federal disclosure rules. The September message, sent by Alt5 Sigma’s chief operations officer Ron Pitters and signed by director David Danziger, informed employees that a special board committee was investigating unspecified “certain matters concerning the company”. Chief revenue officer Vay Tham was also placed on leave, according to the email obtained by Forbes from two sources close to the company. Potential regulatory violations Under SEC regulations, public companies must file a Form 8-K within four business days when an executive officer effectively stops serving in their role. Sharing his insight on the matter, James Park, a securities law professor at UCLA, reportedly stated that materially false or misleading filings could violate federal anti-fraud provisions. “There is a high hurdle to establish such a violation,” Park noted, adding that prosecutors would need to prove intent and possibly harm to investors. Alan Palmiter, a professor emeritus of securities law at Wake Forest University, was more direct about the stakes. “Knowingly filing false, material information is a sure way to get into lots of trouble,” he said. “The question then is, first, whether the SEC has the guts to investigate. And here, maybe not.” An Alt5 Sigma spokesperson confirmed the board’s special committee is investigating matters, including a subsidiary’s legal troubles in Rwanda, where it was found criminally liable for illicit enrichment and money laundering. The company is appealing the verdict whilst claiming it was the victim of fraud. However, Alt5 Sigma did not provide answers to the questions of whether the Rwanda issue was the reason behind the executive suspensions, nor did it explain the discrepancy in the SEC filing date. The Trump connection The timing of potential regulatory problems is particularly sensitive given Alt5 Sigma’s deep ties to World Liberty Financial, the crypto venture co-founded by Donald Trump and his three sons. In August, Alt5 Sigma accumulated 7.28 billion WLFI tokens through a circular deal that reportedly routed an estimated $500 million to an entity affiliated with the president. A Trump-affiliated limited liability company owns approximately 38% of World Liberty Financial and is entitled to around 75% of proceeds from token sales. As of Friday morning, Alt5 Sigma’s WLFI token holdings were valued at approximately $894 million, more than four times the company’s $205 million market capitalization. The company’s stock has plummeted about 80% from $8.42 when the World Liberty deal was announced to $1.67 at Thursday’s close. What happens next? The SEC, now chaired by Trump appointee Paul Atkins, declined to comment on whether it would investigate the disclosure discrepancy. So far, there is no evidence of company insiders trading Alt5 Sigma shares during the six weeks between the internal September message and the October filing. Palmiter stated that while SEC action may be unlikely given the current political environment, private securities fraud class action lawsuits remain a possibility. “If there is a law firm interested in getting a little bit of lawyers’ fees, these securities fraud class actions are often prevalent,” he said. Tassiopoulos remains an Alt5 Sigma employee and board member, according to a World Liberty Financial attorney. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

54726207,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=856565,1763766000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/54726207.jpeg,"Crypto Crash Is A Forced Crypto Seller Unwind, Glassnode Co-Founders Claim",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-crashforced-crypto-seller-unwind/,"Glassnode co-founders Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, who publish under the @Negentropic handle on X, argue that the current crypto crash is being driven not by a broad narrative turn, but by a single, systematic source of sell pressure whose footprint is most visible in Bitcoin and is spilling into the wider complex. Their core assertion is categorical: “What’s happening in Bitcoin right now isn’t a narrative shift: it’s a mechanical unwind.” In that framing, the tape is reflecting the forced exit of one participant rather than an organic repricing of crypto risk. Why Is The Crypto Market Crashing? Negentropic’s thesis starts with momentum indicators behaving in ways they say are inconsistent with “natural markets.” They note that “the 1D MACD just printed a new all-time low… yet price is only down ~33% from the highs,” and add, “This doesn’t happen in natural markets. You only get this when someone is dumping in a straight line.” They pair that observation with capitulation-like oscillators that are not accompanied by the usual macro or leverage shock. As they put it, RSI is near capitulation, “but there’s no macro stress, no credit shock, no leverage detonation, no ETF outflows.” The mismatch matters to their conclusion: “It’s extreme momentum without a catalyst: classic signature of mechanical selling.” Related Reading: Crypto Traders See Bullish Tailwind: Hassett Jumps In Fed Chair Odds They then contrast today’s setup with prior episodes where MACD and RSI reached similar extremes. In those historical cases, Negentropic says, “Price was down 60%, derivatives were blowing out, funding was deeply negative.” By contrast, their read of the present is that confirming stress isn’t there. “ETFs remain net positive, their cost basis is still intact,” they write, and they emphasize that “long-term holders are removing supply aggressively.” They also point to cross-crypto resilience: “Solana ETF inflows are steady, altcoins are holding up relatively well vs btc & eth,” and “eth is holding stronger than btc.” For Negentropic, those relative-strength signals are the tell that this is not a systemwide risk-off event. “If this were real sentiment, all of that would be breaking. It isn’t,” they conclude. Flow regularity is the other pillar of the Glassnode co-founders’ case. They describe a pattern that they say has repeated since October 10: “Same timestamps, same venue-specific thinness, same lack of reflexive bids.” The implication is mechanical intent rather than discretionary trading. “It’s a schedule, not a market,” they write, claiming “21 days of consistent toxic flow.” That sequence, in their view, aligns with “one explanation”: “a liquidity provider or fund was structurally damaged on October 10th,” and “the entity tied to that failure has been reducing risk in a forced, rules-based manner.” Independent tape watchers are describing a remarkably similar cadence. Front Runners (@frontrunnersx) reports that a large seller on Binance has been hitting the market with clock-like consistency. Over “two weeks straight,” they say, the entity “hit the sell button exactly at 9:30 EST, every US market open, without fail.” They add that “kind of consistency usually points to a sophisticated actor operating under specific mandates or time windows,” and that it looks “less like random flow and more like a single entity (or a tightly-coordinated group).” Macro analyst Alex Krüger expands on how that could manifest across venues. He suggests the seller could be “dumping during US hours via a broker or OTC desk that employs smart order routing or hedging strategies across multiple venues.” In his view, the dominance of Binance prints doesn’t require Binance to be the origin. “Most volume naturally” would flow there, he argues, “since it’s where the bulk of the liquidity resides.” Related Reading: Crypto Market Wipes Out $1 Trillion Since October: Analyzing The Forces Behind The Crash Krüger also highlights venue asymmetries that fit a routed-flow story: he has seen “relatively little spot selling routed via Coinbase this week,” while noting “extraordinary levels of spot selling via Bitfinex.” Will The Crypto Crash Be Short-Lived? Delphi Ventures founding partner Tommy Shaughnessy focuses on the urgency implied by the pace. If the flow has been present since 10/10, he writes, “the speed at which they’re selling BTC is pretty crazy.” He interprets that as compulsion rather than strategy: “Means they are price insensitive and need to exit, fast.” Shaughnessy characterizes the move as “violent,” but adds a key qualifier consistent with Negentropic’s finite-seller framing: it’s likely “short lived because it’s not orderly.” If there is a body from 10/10 the speed at which they’re selling $BTC is pretty crazy Means they are price insensitive and need to exit, fast. (Someone had that chart of all red candles for days) Violent but means it’s hopefully short lived because it’s not orderly https://t.co/kaJAKh5Z4M — Tommy (@Shaughnessy119) November 21, 2025 Multicoin Capital founder Tushar Jain likewise describes what he sees as forced liquidation behavior. “It feels like a big forced seller is in the market,” he writes, adding, “We are seeing systematic selling during specific hours.” Jain explicitly ties this to the same October window Negentropic flags, calling it “probably a consequence of 10/10 liquidations,” and says it’s “hard to imagine this scale of forced selling continues for much longer.” He also situates the moment within a longer unwind process, recalling a lesson from prior cycles: “it takes some time for all the bankruptcies to reveal themselves after a big liquidation flush like this,” because “shops are running around trying to figure out what their exposure to insolvent counterparties is.” It feels like a big forced seller is in the market. We are seeing systematic selling during specific hours. Probably a consequence of 10/10 liquidations. Hard to imagine this scale of forced selling continues for much longer. https://t.co/JO6kRmJUUb — Tushar Jain (@tushar_jain) November 19, 2025 Taken together, the sources are presenting a coherent, internally consistent read: crypto’s downside is being dominated by a single, time-boxed, price-insensitive seller whose execution pattern is systematic enough to warp momentum indicators and intraday structure. Negentropic’s bottom line is not merely descriptive but interpretive: “This is not capitulation. This is not a trend break.” It is, instead, “a constrained unwinding through a fractured market.” And because mechanical sellers end when inventory or mandate ends, the Glassnode co-founders argue that when it does, “the rebound will likely be far sharper than the decline that preceded it.” At press time, the total crypto market cap was at $2.83 trillion.

54726211,632259,1763766015,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54726211.jpeg,Cardano Founder Reveals Midnight Launch Roadmap,https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-midnight-launch-roadmap/,"At the Midnight Summit, Cardano founder and Input Output Global CEO Charles Hoskinson set out a staged rollout for Midnight, a privacy-and-identity network he describes as crypto’s next generational layer. In a Dapp Central interview , he positioned Midnight as an extender of existing ecosystems rather than a competitor: “We’re here to make your life easier and allow you to do new things your network doesn’t do… and you can pay in that network’s token,” pointing to interoperability with major chains such as Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin and XRP. Cardano Sidechain Launches In Four Stages Hoskinson’s deployment plan is a four-gate launch intended to move from distribution to full decentralization through sequential upgrades. The first gate is liquidity and token delivery. The Cardano founder said NIGHT claims and initial market trading begin on December 8, 2025, the point at which Midnight becomes price-discoverable: “They get the tokens, they can trade them on exchanges and DEXes… it creates a price signal it’s on CoinMarketCap, it’s a real thing.” He tied this to the Glacier Drop and Scavenger Mine funnels, estimating participation at “well more than a million users,” while acknowledging wallet counts don’t map cleanly to individuals. The second gate is a federated mainnet targeted for Q1 2026. Hoskinson described a production environment with mixed operators—some nodes run by IOG and some by external enterprises, including a Fortune 500 participant—so Midnight’s builder base can deploy applications with real users before final decentralization. He cited more than 100 partners already building for Midnight, and summit materials likewise list federated mainnet as the next milestone after NIGHT liquidity. The third gate is an incentivized testnet to onboard stake pool operators and validate Midnight’s final consensus protocol. Hoskinson said the protocol has formal liveness and safety proofs and targets roughly 5,000 transactions per second with sub-second blocks, but has never been deployed on Substrate. “It would be irresponsible just to kind of launch that out,” he said, arguing that both the algorithm and operator tooling must be proven under incentives before mainnet adoption. The fourth gate follows once the incentivized testnet is stable: a hard fork into the final mainnet consensus and a completed end-to-end network. The Cardano founder expects this phase to coincide with broad exchange access and a transition from Cardano-adjacent rollout to general cross-chain privacy services: “Midnight wakes up… to a Midnight-Ethereum, Midnight-Solana, Midnight-Bitcoin […] Midnight-XRP .” In his framing, this is when Midnight becomes a neutral privacy layer that other ecosystems consume rather than a single-community product. Midnight’s adoption strategy hinges on dual-token economics. NIGHT holders generate DUST , a consumable fuel for computation. Through a “capacity exchange,” DUST can be sold for other chains’ tokens or delegated by DApp builders so users can interact without first buying crypto. Hoskinson framed this as importing Web2’s frictionless payment expectation into Web3: “If you have NIGHT […] your users […] can use your DApp for free without having a token […] That’s an entirely new thing in the cryptocurrency space.” Hoskinson also argued that AI makes privacy economically existential. He said models are “hoovering up… your likeness and your output,” enabling uncompensated digital replicas and accelerating job displacement: “People realize this is existential now […] it’s I no longer have a job.” In response, Midnight’s selective-disclosure stack is meant to let users reclaim data ownership and use zero-knowledge proofs to verify properties—such as humanity or eligibility—without revealing identity, countering what he described as bot-heavy online participation. Governance is presented as a correction to Cardano’s institutional friction. Hoskinson said Midnight’s code governance will be housed at the Linux Foundation and executed by a KPI-driven Midnight Foundation, aiming for clearer accountability and faster delivery. Hoskinson summarized the endpoint as a “crypto triumvirate”: “Bitcoin is the trust and value layer […] Cardano the computation layer […] Midnight the privacy and identity layer.” If the four gates land as described—December 8 liquidity, Q1 2026 federated mainnet, Q2 2026 incentivized testnet, then a final mainnet hard fork—Midnight’s cross-ecosystem privacy thesis will move from roadmap to live infrastructure through 2026.

Trading volume has surged 48% to nearly $9 billion in the past 24 hours, now making up 8% of XRP’s circulating supply. Momentum is now deeply oversold. The Relative Strength Index has crashed to 24 on lower time frames, a level that often precedes short-term bounces. If XRP holds here and forms a double bottom, the path to recovery could target the $2.30 zone, offering a potential 21% rebound from current prices.

This explosive growth signals a fundamental shift in how enterprises are embracing artificial intelligence for customer service operations. How Sierra AI is Revolutionizing Enterprise Customer Service Sierra’s rapid ascent to $100 million ARR demonstrates the massive demand for intelligent AI solutions in the enterprise space. The company’s AI agents are handling complex customer interactions that previously required human intervention, from healthcare patient authentication to mortgage applications and credit card replacements. The Power Behind Sierra AI’s Customer Service Transformation Founded by industry veterans Bret Taylor and Clay Bavor, Sierra AI brings together decades of tech expertise. Taylor’s background includes co-creating Google Maps, founding FriendFeed, serving as Facebook’s CTO, and co-leading Salesforce. Bavor spent 18 years at Google overseeing products like Gmail and Google Drive. Enterprise AI Adoption Reaches Tipping Point What surprised even the founders was the breadth of industry adoption. While tech companies like Deliveroo, Discord, and Rivian were expected early adopters, traditional businesses including ADT, Bissell, Vans, Cigna, and SiriusXM have also embraced Sierra’s AI agents. Customer Type Examples Use Cases Tech Companies Deliveroo, Discord, Ramp, Rivian, SoFi, Tubi Customer support, order processing, technical assistance Traditional Enterprises ADT, Bissell, Vans, Cigna, SiriusXM Patient authentication, returns processing, mortgage applications Bret Taylor’s Vision for AI-Driven Business Transformation Taylor and Bavor’s partnership dates back to 2005 when Taylor hired Bavor at Google. Their combined experience in building scalable consumer and enterprise products has positioned Sierra AI as a category leader in the competitive AI customer service market. Why AI Agents Are Becoming Essential for Modern Businesses Sierra’s success highlights several key advantages of AI-powered customer service: 24/7 Availability : AI agents provide round-the-clock support without human limitations Cost Efficiency : Outcomes-based pricing model charges only for completed work Scalability : Handles fluctuating demand without additional hiring Consistency : Delivers uniform service quality across all interactions Competitive Landscape and Market Position While facing competition from startups like Decagon and Intercom, Sierra claims leadership in the AI customer service category. The company’s recent $350 million funding round led by Greenoaks Capital valued Sierra at $10 billion, representing a 100x revenue multiple based on current ARR. Investment Backing and Future Growth Trajectory Sierra’s investor roster reads like a who’s who of venture capital, including Sequoia, Benchmark, ICONIQ, and Thrive Capital. This strong financial backing, combined with the company’s innovative outcomes-based pricing model, positions Sierra for continued rapid expansion. Frequently Asked Questions What is Sierra AI’s current valuation? Sierra was last valued at $10 billion following a $350 million funding round in September. Who are Sierra AI’s founders? The company was founded by Bret Taylor , former Salesforce co-CEO, and Clay Bavor , Google veteran who led products like Gmail and Google Drive. What types of customers use Sierra AI? Customers range from tech companies like Deliveroo , Discord , and Rivian to traditional businesses including ADT , Bissell , and Cigna . How does Sierra AI’s pricing work? The company uses an outcomes-based model, charging customers for completed work rather than flat subscription fees. What makes Sierra AI different from competitors? Sierra focuses on building AI agents that handle complex, multi-step customer service tasks rather than simple chatbot interactions. The Future of AI in Enterprise Customer Service Sierra’s remarkable $100 million ARR achievement in under two years demonstrates that AI transformation in customer service is no longer a future possibility but a present reality. As businesses across all sectors recognize the efficiency and scalability benefits of AI agents, companies like Sierra are positioned to redefine how enterprises interact with their customers. The speed of adoption and diverse industry penetration suggests we’re witnessing just the beginning of a fundamental shift in business operations.

The platform now accepts ETH as collateral, a move that could strengthen bullish Ethereum price predictions in the weeks ahead. Previously available only to Bitcoin holders, the loan product now allows eligible users to borrow up to $1 million in USDC without selling their ETH. If you believe in somΞTHing, this one's for you. ETH-backed loans are here. You can borrow USDC against your Ethereum, unlocking liquidity without selling. Available now in the U.S. (ex. NY). pic.twitter.com/eOvJ2BWPfr — Coinbase (@coinbase) November 20, 2025 The integration aims to serve long-term holders seeking liquidity for expenses such as down payments or debt refinancing, without creating a taxable event. A service that has been seeing increasing demand this cycle. Crypto-collateralized lending hit a record $73.6 billion in Q3, according to a Galaxy Research report . Coinbase’s BTC-backed loans alone have already facilitated over $1.27 billion in borrowing and $1.38 billion in collateral from roughly 16,000 customers, according to company data . For Ethereum, this strengthens its broader financial appeal by helping bridge TradFi and DeFi. The structure mirrors traditional securities-backed credit lines, making ETH a more dependable balance-sheet asset for institutions. Ethereum Price Predictions: Institutions Could Save the ETH Downtrend This long-term holding incentive could help stabilize price movements against recent market headwinds, particularly as ETH navigates a potential bullish head-and-shoulder pattern. A historical demand zone around $2,750 stands as a potential bottom to the right shoulder, particularly as momentum indicators flash a reversal.

The MACD confirms weakening sell pressure, flattening below the signal line in the early stages of a trend shift. A fully realised pattern breakout could see the neckline reclaimed around $5,500 , surpassing past all-time highs into new price discovery with a 100% move. But as the bull market matures, if Ethereum continues to feature on mainstream balance sheets through corporate treasuries and ETF accumulation, the push could extend 365% to $10,000 . PepeNode: A New Way to Make Passive Crypto Mining Income With the market at a standstill, investors are seeking more reliable income strategies that don’t hinge on market sentiment. With PepeNode ($PEPENODE) , the process is a simple mine-to-earn (M2E) game. No hardware needed. Just log in, buy virtual nodes , stack rigs, and start earning passive rewards across top-performing meme coins. Momentum is climbing fast. The presale has already passed $2.1 million, while early stakers are still earning up to 593% APY. And thanks to a built-in deflationary model, where 70% of all $PEPENODE spent on nodes and rigs is burned, scarcity supports long-term token value. PepeNode stands out as a smarter way to capture some of the market’s strongest upside—without worrying about timing the perfect entry.

Bitcoin and Ethereum have dropped by 10% in 24 hours, while some major altcoins (e.g., Sui, Aptos, Pump.fun) have suffered losses in excess of 15%. These falls come as stock markets in the United States and elsewhere wobble in the face of AI-related uncertainty, and in response to fears that the Federal Reserve may hold off cutting interest rates. However, while this may be bad news in the near term, this article takes a closer look at PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , which we’ve selected as the best altcoin coin to buy for anyone wanting to make gains during the current bear market. Best Altcoin Coin to Buy During the Crypto Crash – 21 November Running on the Ethereum blockchain, PEPENODE isn’t simply another run-of-the-mill meme coin, but rather a mine-to-earn token that gives holders the opportunity to mine without having to invest in expensive equipment and hardware. Calm hands. Sharp focus. Full bags https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/31MHQsE8GZ — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) November 21, 2025 It opened its presale in late September and has now raised $2.1 million from enthusiastic investors, who are buying into its roadmap. As a mine-to-earn token, it enables users to build and run their own virtual mining rig, which they can grow by spending PEPENODE tokens on more virtual mining nodes. More nodes result in greater rewards, with PEPENODE issuing mining rewards in the form of third-party tokens such as Fartcoin and the original Pepe. This mining platform provides a strong incentive to acquire PEPENODE, meaning that the token could attract massive demand once its platform launches. If that weren’t enough, it also benefits from an attractive staking system, which currently pays an annual yield of 593%. This could make PEPENODE a hugely lucrative token to own and hold, which perhaps accounts for why its presale has been gaining momentum in recent weeks. PEPENODE Could Be One of the Biggest Altcoins of 2026 Given PEPENODE’s tokenomics, it has every chance of surging once it lists in the near future. It will have a max supply of 210 billion tokens, which it will allocate between its treasury, development, node rewards, listings, and marketing. Investors can join its presale now by going to its official website , where they can connect a compatible wallet (e.g., Best Wallet) and buy the token at the current price of $0.0011592. This price rises every three days until the sale ends, so interested buyers should act sooner rather than later, so that they can lock in the biggest potential return. While the market is currently in a bad position, PEPENODE has the potential to make gains even in a bearish climate, which is why it’s our best altcoin coin to buy right now. And in a more positive environment, it could take off in 2026.

54727236,https://timestabloid.com/?p=90328,1763767810,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Bloomberg: November 24 Is Special Day For XRP. Here’s What’s Coming,https://timestabloid.com/bloomberg-november-24-is-special-day-for-xrp-heres-whats-coming/,"Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart has released a revised projection for when the remaining spot XRP exchange-traded funds might begin trading in the United States. Interest in these products has intensified following the recent introduction of the Canary XRP ETF (XRPC) and the Bitwise XRP ETF (XRP), both of which have generated significant attention from market participants anticipating broader institutional access to the asset. Projected Debut Dates for Grayscale and Franklin Templeton Products Seyffart addressed the potential timeline for upcoming funds from Grayscale and Franklin Templeton after new filings from the two issuers hinted at progress. In a recent post on X, he stated that his current expectation is for the Grayscale XRP ETF (GXRP), which is transitioning from an existing trust structure, to begin trading on Monday, November 24, 2025. He added that Franklin Templeton’s proposed XRP ETF (EZRP) could also become available on the same date, although he emphasized that this remains a probable rather than guaranteed outcome. Our base case is that @Grayscale 's XRP ETF will go live on Monday the 24th. So will the Grayscale Dogecoin ETF. And I think the @FTI_US XRP ETF could go live on Monday the 24th as well. Lots happening next week. https://t.co/TkA6EE0D6T — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) November 19, 2025 The updated forecast follows several procedural steps by both firms. Grayscale initially revealed plans at the beginning of the year to convert its long-running XRP Trust into an exchange-traded fund. The firm later submitted an amended filing on November 3 aimed at accelerating the conversion through the Form 8-A mechanism. This approach allows the issuer to move forward without waiting for explicit SEC approval, provided that the required 20-day period elapses without intervention. Based on that timeline, the earliest feasible launch date aligns with Seyffart’s November 24 estimate. Franklin Templeton made similar adjustments to its application. Its November 4 amendment removed the language that would have automatically delayed effectiveness, a change that positioned the firm to target the same launch window as Grayscale. Seyffart also noted that Grayscale’s proposed Dogecoin ETF could debut on the same day, potentially making that week one of the busiest in the digital asset ETF landscape in recent months. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Status of Pending Applications from Other Issuers A number of additional asset managers have also filed for spot XRP ETFs, but their launch dates remain uncertain. Companies such as 21Shares, CoinShares, and WisdomTree still await regulatory clearance, and none of the three have taken the procedural steps that would allow their applications to become effective without direct approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In particular, CoinShares and WisdomTree have retained the deferral language in their S-1 documents, and 21Shares preserved the same provision even after its November 7 update. As a result, none of these products is expected to reach the market until the SEC grants explicit authorization. While several issuers await further progress, the two spot XRP ETFs already trading in the U.S. continue to attract investor interest. Combined net inflows into these products have reached $410.76 million. The majority originates from Canary’s XRPC, which has accumulated $305.40 million. Bitwise’s fund, which launched only recently, has drawn $105.36 million so far. The growing number of filings and the rapid asset growth of early entrants indicate sustained institutional demand for regulated exposure to XRP. The coming weeks are positioned to shape expectations for how quickly additional products may join the market, particularly if Seyffart’s projected timeline proves accurate.

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/7-7-billion-in-xrp-in-three-months-heres-what-happened/,"New data from the XRP rich list shows that large investors have significantly increased their positions since August, adding more than $7.7 billion worth of the asset during a period marked by declining prices and weakened market confidence. While some market participants reduced exposure during the downturn, the largest holders have steadily grown their balances, indicating a sustained accumulation phase. Whale Activity During a Prolonged Market Decline XRP has been under persistent selling pressure since mid-July 2025, following its peak price of $3.66. The asset has continued to record lower highs for three consecutive months, and its current valuation of $1.89 reflects a 48% decline from its July high. This extended drawdown has contributed to a largely negative sentiment among retail investors. However, on-chain metrics reveal that substantial holders have adopted a markedly different approach. Instead of reducing their exposure, many of the largest wallets have expanded their positions during the price drop. Data compiled from the community-maintained rich list indicates broad-based accumulation among major holders, with particularly strong activity among accounts holding tens or hundreds of millions of tokens. Increase in Balances Among Large XRP Whales Wallets containing between 20 million and 500 million XRP tokens have shown the most pronounced growth. When these wallet segments were last reviewed on August 21, they collectively held 17.378 billion tokens, representing more than a quarter of the circulating supply at that time. Within that group, 159 addresses held between 20 million and 100 million XRP, with a combined balance of 6.315 billion tokens. Another 55 addresses contained between 100 million and 500 million XRP, accounting for 11.063 billion XRP. Current figures show notable expansion. There are now 215 wallets in the 20–100 million XRP category, and their total holdings have risen to 10.021 billion. This increase amounts to 3.706 billion additional XRP, valued at approximately $7.11 billion based on the prevailing price. Balances in the 100–500 million XRP bracket have also risen. While the number of wallets in this group has not changed, their collective holdings now stand at 11.385 billion XRP. This reflects an increase of 364 million tokens, equivalent to roughly $698 million at current market rates. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Combined, these large whale categories have accumulated 4.07 billion XRP in just three months, holdings now valued at roughly $7.81 billion. As a result, they currently control approximately 21.406 billion XRP, accounting for 35.5% of the circulating supply. Accumulation Trends Among Smaller Address Tiers Although the largest wallets show the most dramatic growth, several smaller address groups have also expanded their positions. Holders with 20 to 500 XRP have increased their combined total from 210 million to 215 million XRP. Addresses containing 1,000 to 5,000 XRP collectively added nearly 7 million XRP over the same period. The pattern of accumulation is even more pronounced among mid-sized wallets. Addresses holding between 10,000 and 25,000 XRP have increased their combined balance by more than 113 million XRP in the last quarter. Several other categories between 5,000 and 100,000 XRP have also recorded steady increases, reinforcing the broader trend of accumulation despite prevailing market conditions. While many investor groups have expanded their holdings, not all high-value addresses followed the same trajectory. Wallets containing between 500 million and 1 billion XRP reduced their combined balances by more than 2.1 billion tokens since late August. In contrast, the largest category, wallets with at least 1 billion XRP, has expanded by over 1.5 billion tokens during the same timeframe.

According to Santiment analytics, wallets holding between one million and ten million tokens were the primary contributors, adding significant sell-side liquidity to an already fragile market. This sudden influx of supply arrived at a time when XRP was already battling bearish sentiment across the broader crypto space. The asset slipped 10.32% in 24 hours, falling below the key $2 psychological level, touching lows near $1.85, and posting double-digit losses within a single day. XRP's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview Extreme Fear Grips the Market Market indicators paint a grim picture. XRP is trading below both its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages, signalling sustained downward momentum. The Fear & Greed Index sits at 14, firmly in “extreme fear” territory, while selling volume surged past $7.2 billion in 24 hours. Analysts warn that a failure to reclaim resistance near $2.30 could open the door to deeper losses, with short-term projections suggesting a potential drop toward $1.50 if bearish pressure continues. The weakness is not isolated to XRP. Bitcoin’s retreat below the $85,000 zone and Ethereum’s slide below $3,000 have triggered market-wide liquidations, with macro uncertainty adding fuel. Concerns over a possible delay in Federal Reserve rate cuts, driven by soft U.S. jobs data and rising unemployment, have dented investor appetite for risk assets across the board. Will XRP Stabilize or Sink Further? The big question now is whether whales will continue distributing or pause their offloading. If no new wave of large-scale selling emerges, analysts believe XRP could stabilize and attempt to reclaim the $2 mark in the coming sessions. Recovery projections place the short-term target between $2.50 and $2.70, though this would require a decisive break above long-standing resistance. Medium-term predictions remain cautiously optimistic but restrained. Many experts expect XRP to trade between $1.96 and $2.27 into the end of 2025, with stronger upside momentum unlikely until regulatory clarity and upcoming ETF activity begin shaping demand heading into 2026.
