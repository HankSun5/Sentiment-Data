Alex insists that Palantir is “the most important software company in America and therefore in the world.” That claim came as he confronted renewed criticism over Palantir’s role in government systems capable of linking tax files, biometric information, and personal records. Palantir software powers deportations, drones, and NHS Questions over whether Alex is the “scariest CEO in the world” resurfaced after his media appearances. Some point to Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Peter Thiel as competition, but trust me, Alex brings his own entirely different eccentric style to the party. Viewers saw him speak at rapid speed, shake both fists on CNBC’s Squawk Box and demand to know why short sellers were targeting Palantir when its stock had climbed almost 600% in a year. “It’s super triggering,” he said. “Why do they have to go after us?” Palantir’s influence reaches across the US government. Its AI tools help ICE carry out deportations, support the Pentagon’s drone program and guide police departments in their crime-prediction work. Outside the US, its software supports the Israel Defense Forces in Gaza, assists Ukrainian forces in their defense against Russia and is used by police and corporations in Europe and beyond. In the UK, Labour’s military and NHS modernization plans rely heavily on Palantir systems. When Keir Starmer visited Washington in February, his first stop after the White House was Palantir’s office, where Alex showed him military technology. A new biography titled The Philosopher in the Valley , written by journalist Michael Steinberger, outlines Alex’s personality in detail. Steinberger writes that “fear is something that really drives him” and describes Palantir as “the embodiment, in a lot of ways, of Karp.” He says Alex built the company around his personal view of the world and his own need for security. Steinberger found Alex contradictory, intense, and shaped by a past that still affects him today. Anyway, Alex earned $6.8 billion in 2024 and owns roughly 20 homes, many designed like sparse ski huts. He calls Palantir “an artists’ colony” and compares himself to Larry David, joking once that his style of humor “might be called Karp Your Enthusiasm.” Alex’s weird political evolution Alex met Peter Thiel in law school at Stanford, where the two connected despite opposing views. Thiel later co-founded PayPal with Elon Musk, while Alex went to Frankfurt to pursue a PhD in social theory. As a Jew, Steinberger writes, Alex wanted to understand “how Germany… descended into barbarism.” When he reconnected with Thiel in 2004 and joined Palantir, he couldn’t code but understood ontology, how information is organized. He persuaded engineers and researchers to join him and pushed the company toward work that other tech firms avoided. Palantir’s mission centered on “defending the west” from the beginning. While tech giants avoided military contracts, Palantir embraced them. Its tools supported the US military in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the company sued the Army in 2016 over blocked contracts. Palantir was connected to the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018, and during the pandemic, its software tracked virus spread and vaccine allocation, while today it works with the CIA, FBI, DHS, NSA, ICE and other federal agencies. Steinberger argues that people misunderstand what Palantir actually does, arguing that Alex does not collect or store people’s data but builds software that lets others use their own data. Politically, Alex is hard to pin down. He opposed Donald Trump in 2016, voted for Hillary Clinton and backed Kamala Harris in 2024. But once Trump returned to the White House, Alex adjusted. He wrote a $1 million inauguration check, and Palantir gave $5 million to Trump’s military parade. In an interview with Axios, he called himself “an independent who admires what Trump has done on many things.” Steinberger said Alex believes that “the price of doing business with the government is making nice with Trump.” Critics say this contradicts Alex’s past warnings about fascism, especially since Palantir’s tools aid ICE in street arrests that sometimes include innocent people. Steinberger said Alex rejects the idea that Trump is fascist and argues that the US still has a working court system and free press. Steinberger added that Alex claims Palantir prevented “innumerable terror attacks” in Europe. On immigration, Alex argues that “if the left doesn’t take this concern seriously, voters are going to turn to people who do, and the left isn’t going to like the outcome. That’s how you got the first Trump presidency, and arguably it’s one of the reasons you got the second one.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

According to Arkham data, a total of $7.5 million worth of cryptocurrency was transferred to different wallets in the last 24 hours. Authorities transferred $300,000 worth of NEXO, $3 million worth of WETH, and $4.2 million worth of TRX in the last 24 hours. The NEXO and TRX assets were reportedly seized two years ago as part of Alameda Research investigations, while the WETH reportedly came from cryptocurrencies seized between 2022 and 2024 in the Bitfinex hacker Ilya Lichtenstein case.

The token remains priced at only $0.035, but demand has been extreme to an extent that its current stage is nearing a sell out. It is emerging as one of the most successful projects in the new crypto and DeFi crypto categories as more investors observe early-stage projects entering Q4 2025. The question most investors are currently raising is how come the support of the project is taking off so fast. Developing a Dual-Lending DeFi System Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating a two-sided lending organization that is lender-borrower-based. It has passive-yield tools, risk controls and automatic functions, which maintain stability in the lending markets. mtTokens is one of the internal characteristics. Users get to receive mtTokens when they provide their assets. These tokens monitor deposits and allow one to realize yield with time. Using the example of the user, who provides his assets worth $1,000, the value of his mtTokens will keep rising with the accrual of interests in the liquidity pool. Mutuum Finance also involves the borrowing markets which have variable and stable rates. Borrowers abide by straight LTV regulations, and all positions are liquidated via automated procedures using smart contracts. In case the value of collateral becomes too low, the liquidation bot will intervene in an attempt to stabilize the loan. This helps in minimizing risks throughout the protocol as well as contributing to reliability in the long-run. Mutuum Finance operates on a buy-distribute channel. The one part of the protocol revenue purchases MUTM on the market and reinvests it into users that stake mtTokens on the safety module. This generates stable token demand that is associated with platform activity but not hype. Security has too been a concern. Mutuum Finance underwent the CertiK audit with a high score of the 90/100 Token Scan score and a bug bounty of $50k that targets the vulnerability of its code. Presale Momentum Mutuum finance is currently conducting one of the most vibrant offerings of tokens within the top crypto initiatives below $1. The presale has already raised approximately $18.8M, as well as established a community of more than 18,000 holders. The pre-sale was launched at the start of 2025, with the token being issued at the low price of $0.01. It has since risen to the current $0.035 that is 250% higher than in the initial stage. The present stage is already about 90% allocated in which we can see that the buyers are rapidly buying The 24-hour leaderboard also helps to support demand. This element will award the best daily buyer $500 of MUTM, and enhance the activity and interest in every day of presale. Card payments are also available at Mutuum finance, and this will have more participants joining the ecosystem with less dependency on crypto transfer. V1 Launch in Q4 2025 The team affirmed that the Mutuum Finance V1 protocol would exist in the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. The basic elements of the lending system (a liquidity pool, issuing of mtTokens) are present in this first version, as well as the debt tokens and the liquidation bot, which are supported by ETH and USDT as supply and borrow and collateral assets. This change of building to testing is important. Mutuum Finance is already on the step of users interacting with the product. The transitioning of theory into actual performance is where the interest of the investor is more likely to rise. Together with an already established CertiK audit and an open bug bounty, the protocol demonstrates that security was the key focus of the design. Growth Drivers In future steps, Mutuum Finance also has plans of USD-pegged stable-coin. According to many analysts, this will be able to bolster long-term value since stablecoins provide consistent demand, liquidity and real utility within lending markets. It is also on the roadmap to expand layer-2. Expanding into several chains has the potential to increase the number of users and subsequently cost a column on transactions, which offers an expansion opportunity to MUTM. According to these characteristics, there are analysts of MUTM that say MUTM’s price could increase many times more than it did before sales, when V1 is launched and its demand with the help of real protocols usage grows. Whale Interest Building As Phase 6 approaches being 100% allocated, the window at the current price of $0.035 is being closed rapidly. The increase of investors is continuing to rise and the involvement of whales has been rising as major milestones are reached by the project. This is a mix of fast presale gains, high utility design, back of the security and a guarantee of V1 release that has placed Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as one of the most highly anticipated new crypto-tokens under $0.05.

After a period of decisive movements, the market now finds itself in a state where previous directional force has largely dissipated, allowing for a re-evaluation of its path. A Necessary Reset Before Bitcoin’s Next Big Push In an X post, Swissblock has mentioned that Bitcoin momentum is clearly in a reset phase, and the question now is how long until it flips. Historically, in late February to early April 2025, the bottom required roughly 7 weeks for a full momentum to reset. Moving further back to late June to late September 2024, the correction took close to 14 weeks for a full reset and consolidation before a clear trend emerged. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bear Market Confirmed? Expert Predicts Price Target Of $40,000 By Late 2026 Data shows that the current momentum reset has been underway for weeks, placing BTC right inside the window where past cycles have typically reached exhaustion. This zone historically marks the point where downside pressure weakens and the higher probability of a counter-trend move increases sharply. The crypto market is collapsing. An industry-leading commentary on the global capital markets, The Kobeissi Letter, revealed that on October 6th, just 45 days ago, Bitcoin touched an all-time high of $126,272, with the total crypto market capitalization reaching $2.5 trillion. However, everything changed on October 10th, when President Donald Trump threatened 100% tariffs on China, shifting the surface of the crypto market. This announcement triggered a chain reaction record of $19.2 billion in liquidations, the highest ever recorded in a single event, and BTC never truly recovered from the shock. Even when a trade deal between the US and China was reached on October 30th, the liquidation pressures only worsened. Since November 10th, BTC price action has moved into a literal straight line lower, with average daily liquidations approaching $1 billion. Throughout this entire 45-day bear market, there has been an absence of bearish fundamental developments within the crypto space. Kobeissi concluded that this is a mechanical bear market driven by an excessive level of leverage and sporadic liquidations, claiming the market is efficient, and it will iron itself out. Will BTC Emerge Stronger From This Test? This current Bitcoin correction has now fallen perfectly in line with the previous major drawdowns of this cycle. A full-time crypto trader and investor, Daan Crypto Trades, highlighted that each of these corrections in the ongoing cycle has their own story, but this one is hitting the market the hardest.

He outlined an upcoming shift in how the cryptocurrency will be accessed , pointing to a future where the altcoin is obtained only through institutional products. Why Buying XRP Could Become Impossible In The Future On Thursday, Van Code announced via an X post that XRP is on track to become inaccessible for direct retail purchase as the market transitions toward institutionally controlled vehicles. He predicts that within a couple of years, major custodians will hold nearly all native XRP, leaving retail investors to gain exposure only through ETFs or bank-managed market marker style products. The market expert ties this outlook to a broader 15-year roadmap he believes is steadily unfolding and expected to reach completion by 2030. He described a future in which XRP would eventually be held mainly by major custodians acting on behalf of banks , fund managers, and other large financial entities. According to him, retail investors would interact with XRP only through products managed by these institutions rather than holding the asset in their own wallets. Van Code also projected that the altcoin could become a wholesale token used strictly for settlement, custody, and transfers between financial institutions. In this model, the majority of retail market participation could shift away from the cryptocurrency itself, instead relying on ETF products that track its performance without granting direct ownership . He referred to this potential evolution as the endgame for both the XRP Ledger and its native token, XRP. He also stressed that many holders have not fully grasped the scale of this potentially ongoing transition or the significance of the token they hold. Where To Store Your Coins Ahead Of The Transition Following Van Code’s prediction, a crypto community member asked where XRP should be held ahead of these potential market changes, noting conflicting advice on exchanges, cold wallets, and possible bank custody. Van Code responded by outlining the strengths and weaknesses of each option. He stated that crypto exchanges offer simplicity for users with limited technical knowledge but require trust that the platform remains solvent. On the other hand, cold wallets provide complete control and ownership of private keys but introduce higher risks of user error, permanent loss, and estate-planning complications. Van Code noted that ETFs are likely the safest option from a security and inheritance standpoint because they rely on established stock-register infrastructure with bank-grade protection and compliance. However, they come with fees , may not allow conversion back to native XRP, and could trigger capital gain taxes if a holder sells their existing tokens to buy into an ETF. Ultimately, the market expert explained that the best place to store XRP depends on the holders’ comfort level, technical knowledge, discipline in managing seed phrases, and the amount of tokens held.

54724913,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=866082,1763762528,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54724913.jpeg,Trump is considering allowing Nvidia to export H200 chips to China,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-chinas-xi-jinping-nvidias-h200-chips/,"Donald Trump is now seriously discussing whether to allow Nvidia to send its H200 artificial intelligence chips to China, despite U.S. restrictions that were put in place three years ago. According to Bloomberg, conversations inside the White House have already begun. Trump’s aides have been weighing whether to issue export licenses that would allow Nvidia’s chips, used to train massive AI systems, to reach Chinese firms again. Nothing’s been finalized, but the fact that these talks are happening at all is a major reversal from earlier policies. This debate comes as Trump looks for potential openings with Xi Jinping. Last month, he met with the Chinese leader but didn’t formally bring up Nvidia’s latest chips. That said, people involved in the follow-up say U.S. officials have kept the door open. Discussions are now centered on what type of processors could be sold, without putting what Trump’s team sees as national security at risk. Trump officials push H200 over Blackwell The H200 chip is stronger than the current H20 model allowed in China but is still based on Nvidia’s older Hopper design. The Blackwell line, which is used in the U.S., remains banned. By letting China buy the H200, the administration could offer a middle option, something more powerful than the current legal ceiling but not America’s top-tier chips. Trump’s Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said recently that he could imagine sending Blackwell chips to China, but only once they’re outdated. “Maybe in a year or two,” Bessent told lawmakers. Five months ago, he had said the administration had “no intent” to expand China’s access to advanced semiconductors and confirmed they had even blocked the weaker H20 , something the Biden White House didn’t do. Then weeks later, the U.S. quietly greenlit shipments of the H20 in return for a 15% cut of revenue, an informal deal with no formal legal agreement behind it. Officials at the time said it was part of a wider trade deal with China for rare-earth minerals. But six people familiar with the deal in London allegedly said there was no such trade deal. China’s Commerce Ministry said it approved rare-earth exports because the U.S. had lifted other restrictions, and separately acknowledged the H20 license approval. Howard Lutnick, Trump’s Commerce Secretary, defended the H20 exports by saying, “They’ll get addicted to our tech,” and that it wouldn’t hurt the U.S. because they weren’t selling China the most advanced chips, “not our best stuff, not our second-best stuff, not even our third-best.” Beijing rejects Nvidia’s limited chips, but still wants access Despite Washington’s green light, Beijing told its companies not to buy the H20 or another China-specific Nvidia product. China’s government has been pushing its firms to adopt domestic hardware from players like Huawei, even though most tech companies in the country still want Nvidia’s chips. The local alternatives are weaker and harder to scale. Nvidia, for its part, has been pushing back on U.S. policy. In a statement, it said the restrictions “leave that massive market to our rapidly growing foreign competitors.” The company also said, “Our foreclosure from the China data center compute market has no impact on our ability to supply customers in the USA.” CEO Jensen Huang has been meeting with U.S. officials trying to reverse the restrictions. This internal fight has also reached Congress. A bipartisan group of senators is now writing legislation that would force the Commerce Department to deny all current license applications for advanced chips to China. If that bill passes, the Trump administration’s entire H200 plan would be dead. The White House and Commerce have refused to comment on whether they support H200 exports. But Trump’s team is still debating the best move. Some aides see the H200 as a reasonable middle ground, better than the watered-down chips already available in China, but far behind Blackwell. Others inside the administration want no additional chips sold at all. Lawmakers on both sides agree that too many exports could give China an edge in artificial intelligence.

Dara, 36, formally launched his campaign on Thursday, announcing he will seek the Republican nomination to unseat Democratic incumbent Letitia James. Lawfare isn’t just wrong – it’s costly. I’m running for Attorney General to end lawfare, enforce the law, and create a better business climate in New York to tackle the affordability crisis. Join the fight. Donate today. https://t.co/GhQIuwvIM3 pic.twitter.com/n8Fynf6esq — Khurram Dara (@KhurramDara) November 20, 2025 His message centers on ending what he calls “lawfare,” the use of legal actions as political weapons, and reversing years of aggressive crypto enforcement under James’s leadership. Ex-Coinbase Lawyer Says James’ Crypto Crackdowns Are Pushing Businesses Out of New York Dara has been showing his political ambitions since August, often criticizing James’ approach as harmful to innovation and the state’s business climate. He argues that New York’s regulatory environment has driven companies, investment, and jobs elsewhere, while contributing to rising costs that residents are struggling to manage. “I’ve seen the cost of lawfare firsthand,” he said during a recent interview. “It drives up the cost of doing business, erodes trust in government, and makes New York less affordable at a time when people are already stretched.” New York needs an Attorney General that will enforce the law, not politicize it. That’s why I’m running. Join the fight. Donate today: https://t.co/GhQIuwvIM3 pic.twitter.com/TFCAQ7PCda — Khurram Dara (@KhurramDara) November 21, 2025 The former Coinbase lawyer brings a long résumé from inside the crypto regulatory world. Until July, he served as the regulatory and policy principal at Bain Capital Crypto, the digital assets arm of the global investment firm. He previously held positions at Fluidity and AirSwap before joining Coinbase in 2022, just as the exchange faced an SEC investigation that would help define the Biden-era crackdown on crypto. He often credits that period with shaping his views on what he sees as unchecked regulatory overreach. Letitia James, who has held office since 2019, has built a national profile through high-profile cases involving Donald Trump, the NRA, and Andrew Cuomo. But she has also made crypto enforcement a central part of her agenda. Her office has brought actions against Gemini, Tether, Digital Currency Group, Genesis, KuCoin, NovaTech, and Galaxy Digital. One of her biggest cases, the 2023 lawsuit against Gemini , Genesis, and DCG, resulted in the return of about $50 million to Gemini Earn users and a broader settlement that effectively shut Genesis’ lending operations in New York. Her critics argue that she has stretched the boundaries of the Martin Act, a century-old law that grants the state broad authority to investigate financial misconduct. Source: Journal of Business & Technology Law NY’s 2026 Ballot Gains Another Crypto-Aligned Candidate as Dara Steps In Dara’s platform calls for limiting how the Act is used and ending contingency-fee deals with private law firms, which allow outside attorneys to take a share of recovered funds. He argues that these arrangements can encourage overly aggressive litigation and turn major enforcement decisions into a form of political theater. His campaign also touches broader statewide concerns, echoing themes from recent local races, including those raised by Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, who won on a message centered on affordability. @ZohranKMamdani has been elected as New York City’s next mayor, marking a notable win for crypto prediction markets. #Mamdani #Crypto https://t.co/UGbQ5fFNBQ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 5, 2025 Dara says ending regulatory excess and streamlining oversight would help lower costs for businesses and ultimately consumers. Political forces around the race are beginning to shift. Some New York business leaders publicly welcomed Dara’s announcement, pointing to heightened uncertainty after the city’s recent mayoral election. “It is encouraging to see a candidate with a pro-business, pro-innovation approach who could help restore confidence in our great city,” said Keith Grossman, president of MoonPay. James is expected to seek a third term despite facing new political headwinds, including federal charges last month alleging mortgage fraud connected to a property in Virginia, charges she has pleaded not guilty to and described as politically motivated. The state’s 2026 political field is also beginning to show more crypto-aligned candidates. John Deaton, the attorney known for representing XRP holders in the SEC’s case against Ripple, recently announced he will again run as a Republican, this time challenging Senator Ed Markey in Massachusetts after losing his 2024 bid against Elizabeth Warren. Crypto attorney John Deaton is running for the U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts again, but hasn't mentioned any pro-crypto policies in his campaign. #JohnDeaton #CryptoLawyer #MassachusettsSenateRace https://t.co/vNoEGNTp6q — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 12, 2025 Crypto’s growing political footprint suggests the issue will be central in several 2026 races, but nowhere more so than New York, home to Wall Street, a major share of U.S. crypto companies, and the country’s toughest digital-asset rules. Under state nominating laws, Dara will need either 25% of the vote at the GOP convention in February or enough petition signatures to enter the primary. His only declared Republican opponent so far is Michael Henry, the party’s 2022 nominee.

The conversation focused on why the pardon was granted, how the process worked, and the many rumors circulating online. Guillén Addresses Public Controversy The lawyer explained that CZ was accused of failing to implement proper anti-money laundering programs and compliance systems at Binance, but emphasized that this was a regulatory issue, not a criminal offence, and that no illegal activity had taken place. “He was pardoned because he should not have been prosecuted in the first place,” she said, adding that the pardon statement from President Trump proved that he had not committed any crime. Guillén described CZ as the only individual ever prosecuted for such regulatory violations, noting that this treatment was inconsistent with how executives at large financial institutions are typically handled. She also believes that the Binance founder became a target in what she described as part of regulators’ “war on crypto,” particularly in the aftermath of the FTX collapse. Explaining the pardon process, the legal professional said applications usually undergo extensive review by multiple offices, including the Department of Justice, the Office of the Pardon Attorney, and the White House Counsel, before the president makes the final decision. She rejected claims of a “quid pro quo” or corruption, describing such speculation as based on misinterpretations and unverified sources. The attorney also addressed misunderstandings regarding CZ’s business relationships, including links to firms like World Liberty Financial, clarifying that these connections have been widely misread. Guillén added that political statements, such as those made by Senator Elizabeth Warren, were inaccurate and showed how much influence public officials have over perception. Zhao’s Return to Binance Guillén has also confirmed that Zhao will not return to the company at this time, as Binance continues to operate under restrictions from multiple U.S. agencies, including the Department of JUSTICE (DOJ), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and the Treasury Department. She explained that these measures remain in place despite the absence of fraud, victims, or a criminal record, limiting Binance’s operations in the U.S. market. The lawyer concluded that while the pardon clarified the accusations against CZ, the broader consequences have affected him and the exchange, while the U.S has lost access to the liquidity and opportunities that come from hosting one of the world’s largest crypto platforms. Meanwhile, she also praised Zhao for remaining calm and positive throughout the ordeal, saying that he handled media scrutiny and public criticism with composure.

The crypto sector has endured a string of sharp pullbacks over the past month as overleveraged positions were wiped out. Bitcoin is now hovering above $85,000, marking a seven-month low. Still, the broader outlook isn’t entirely bleak. Blockchain technology continues to advance, and XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin remain some of crypto’s most resilient long-term players, so there are optimistic scenarios for them in a recovery cycle. Here’s how Gemini AI projects the situation could evolve as the holiday season approaches. XRP (XRP): Gemini AI Predicts a Slump Down to $1 Next Month Gemini AI’s predictive models indicate that Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could slump to around $1 by Christmas, a drop of roughly 50% from its current price near $2. Source: Gemini AI Such a decline would be a dramatic reversal for Ripple’s flagship token, which surged to a seven-year peak of $3.65 in July following Ripple’s major courtroom victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Over the past year, XRP has climbed 70%, outperforming both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Technically, XRP has been trading within a tight consolidation channel for months, repeatedly forming bullish flag setups that have failed to break upward. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) uptrending to 40, XRP is no longer oversold, and some buying momentum could lead to a weekend recovery and stabilisation. However, Gemini AI also outlines a more bullish alternative. A strong move upward could be triggered by this week’s US SEC approval of the 9 XRP spot ETF, which can generate substantial inflows if Bitcoin and Ethereum’s history are anything to go by. Furthermore, large-scale institutional partnerships or favorable U.S. regulatory developments could push XRP to reach $5 to $10 by 2026. Pi Network (PI): Gemini AI Sees a Sudden Rebound and Fast Growth Pi Network ($PI) is unique for its mobile mining system that rewards users with crypto for daily tapping. Now priced around $0.23, PI has risen 8.5% over the past week, highlighting its resilience. However, Gemini AI forecasts a bear market scenario where Pi sinks to $0.04. The alternative trajectory in a bull market is over 100x that figure, possibly reaching $4.34. After a prolonged downtrend following its debut, November appears to be at a turning point. Recent momentum may be tied to Pi Network’s partnership with AI startup OpenMind, which demonstrated that node operators can provide computational services for external enterprises, a groundbreaking use case for blockchain networks. The Pi testnet has also added support for decentralized exchanges, automated market makers, liquidity tools, and a more advanced KYC system, all of which significantly expand the ecosystem’s practical utility. Ethereum (ETH): Gemini AI Projects a Rally Toward $15,000 Ethereum ($ETH) , the core infrastructure powering decentralized apps, smart contracts, and much of modern DeFi, continues to dominate Web3 development. With a market cap above $332 billion and more than $64.5 billion in total value locked in its DeFi protocols, Ethereum remains crypto’s leading programmable network. Gemini AI anticipates that ETH could drop 37% from its current price of $2,799 to $1,763 by the end of the year if current bearishness persists. However, Ethereum’s strong security profile, reliable settlement layer, and commanding role in stablecoins and real-world asset tokenization position it to benefit from institutional inflows should US regulators deliver their long-promised comprehensive crypto legislation. ETH currently faces heavy resistance in the upper $4,000 range. In Gemin’s bull-case scenario, achieving a breakout above this ceiling could pave the way for a new all-time high anywhere between $5,000 and $12,300 by Christmas. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A Rising Meme Coin Outside Gemini AI’s Purview Even in a declining market, capital continues flowing into presales, where traders hunt for low-priced tokens with high upside potential. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is emerging as one of the most intriguing new contenders. The project has already raised nearly $4.2 million in its presale, combining classic Dogecoin-style humor with a modern, energy-efficient blockchain foundation. According to its lore, Maxi Doge spent the early days of crypto watching Dogecoin succeed while he trained in his mother’s basement, aiming to become a top-tier degen. Today, MAXI emphasizes community participation through viral challenges, meme contests, and a strong social media identity. Built on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, MAXI benefits from the network’s scalability, low environmental impact, and large developer ecosystem, advantages that the older, proof-of-work Dogecoin lacks. The token has a total supply of 150.24 billion, with 25% allocated to a “Maxi Fund” intended for marketing and ecosystem growth. Staking rewards currently offer up to 74% APY, though rates decrease as more users join. The presale price begins today at $0.000269, with scheduled increases across later stages. Investors can participate using MetaMask or Best Wallet . Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages.

54725385,https://cryptonews.com/?p=454754,1763764500,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/54725385.jpeg,"Best Crypto to Buy Now 21 November – XRP, Solana, PEPE",https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-21-november-xrp-solana-pepe/,"After briefly touching a record peak of $126,080 on October 6, Bitcoin has spent the past few weeks steadily slipping lower. Now trading around $83,814, the asset has dropped to its lowest level in six months and appears to be in freefall. Even with the retreat, some seasoned market watchers remain unfazed, describing the pullback as a typical market cycle, flushing out excess leverage and easing speculative trading after months of rapid accumulation. In this argument, these bear cycles create a stronger base for the next bull run. At the same time, a new narrative is emerging: Bitcoin may not be the main catalyst of the approaching bull cycle. With that in mind, here’s why XRP, Solana, and Pepe may be the best cryptos to buy at the current discount. XRP (XRP): Positioned to Power a New Global Payments Standard Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) continues to attract attention across the fintech world thanks to its fast, low-cost settlement protocol, technology Ripple argues could eventually serve as a more efficient replacement to SWIFT. XRP has appeared in digital finance reports from the UN Capital Development Fund and the White House, reinforcing its reputation as a top-tier payments asset. Ripple’s expanding partnerships with banks and global payment providers have helped XRP sustain its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of over $116 billion. Ripple’s rollout of RLUSD, a U.S. dollar–backed stablecoin, highlights its broader ambitions in the payments arena. Each RLUSD transaction on Ripple’s ledger burns a small quantity of XRP, linking long-term token value directly to network activity. XRP has climbed 70% over the past year, reaching a new all-time high of $3.65 in July, its first in six years. Over the same period, Bitcoin slipped 14%. With its Relative Strength Index near 31, XRP is a little oversold, which will draw bargain buyers, particularly at its current price of $1.94, a steal for those who believe in the project’s longevity. The launch of nine XRP ETFs this week could spark a dramatic reversal. Additionally, if regulators move ahead with Project Crypto, the proposed national digital asset framework, analysts suggest XRP could aim for $10 or more by 2026. Solana (SOL): Ethereum’s Toughest Rival Eyes a Run Toward $1,000 Solana ($SOL) has quickly become one of the fastest and most scalable smart-contract ecosystems in crypto. With a market capitalization above $71 billion and nearly $9 billion in total value locked across its DeFi network, Solana stands firmly as Ethereum’s strongest competitor. The introduction of Solana spot ETFs from Grayscale and Bitwise on the NYSE earlier this year opened the door for significant institutional inflows, an event that previously fueled major rallies in both Bitcoin and Ethereum. SOL bottomed around $100 earlier this year. At its current price of $128, it’s perilously close to bottoming again. Technical analysts highlight a bullish flag pattern forming since mid-September, with its current level emerging as a key support zone and heavier resistance anticipated around $250. A decisive breakout above that region could send SOL beyond its record high of $293.31, with some projecting a possible run toward $750 during a strong Q4 cycle. Solana’s combination of low fees and high speed continues to attract Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization initiatives, with major firms such as Franklin Templeton and BlackRock utilizing its technology. Pepe (PEPE): The Frog Meme Aiming for a Fresh All-Time High Launched in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) quickly captured the collective imagination of the crypto community, drawing inspiration from Matt Furie’s iconic character from the Boy’s Club webcomic. Now valued at more than $1.7 billion, PEPE has reached global meme-coin status. Even Dogecoin/Bitcoin holder Elon Musk briefly adopted the Pepe meme as his X profile photo, sparking widespread speculation about his holdings across social media. Currently trading at about $0.000004255, the token sits roughly 85% below its late-2024 peak of $0.00002803, weighed down by a slow summer and 2025’s “Downtober” slump. Pepe currently holds an RSI near 31, indicating the likelihood of an accumulation cycle over the weekend, though it trades at its lowest point for nearly a year and eight months. Still, if US regulators deliver securities policy reform to cater to crypto companies, a market reversal and risk-on appetite could push PEPE beyond its previous record before year-end. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): Meme Branding Meets High-Speed Bitcoin Layer-2 Tech A rising star heading into 2026 is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a Bitcoin layer-2 solution packaged as a meme coin. Despite its playful aesthetic, the project is serious in its aims to enhance Bitcoin with fast throughput, low fees, and full smart-contract support. Running on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), the network features decentralized governance and a Canonical Bridge that enables rapid, secure Bitcoin transfers across blockchains. The HYPER presale has already generated more than $28.25 million. Popular analyst Borch Crypto has suggested the token could yield returns up to 100×. A recent audit by Coinsult revealed no smart-contract vulnerabilities, further boosting confidence in the project. HYPER powers transaction fees, governance, and staking, with early presale buyers earning yields of up to 41% APY. Bitcoin is going HYPER in 2026!

Washington couple were involved in Tesla accident The accident reportedly involved a Tesla Model 3 in January 2023, resulting in a fiery crash that left the car so damaged that rescuers allegedly had a difficult time prying open the vehicle’s doors. The couple, Jeffery Dennis and his wife, Wendy, had been running errands on that Saturday afternoon in the Model 3 sedan when it “suddenly and rapidly accelerated out of control,” coming to a stop after it ran into a utility pole, after which it burst into flames, according to the suit, which was filed on Friday. The complaint blames Tesla’s “unique and defective door handle design” for rendering the doors inoperable and impeding the rescue process. This led to Wendy Dennis dying at the scene, and Jeffery Dennis suffering injuries, including burns to his legs. “Several bystanders ran to the vehicle and attempted to assist Jeff and Wendy Dennis, but the Model 3’s door handles would not operate,” the couple’s lawyers said in the lawsuit. “Several good Samaritans even attempted to use a baseball bat to break the car windows to help the Dennisses out of the burning vehicle.” The lawsuit accuses Tesla of negligence and misleading customers, claiming that Elon Musk’s company knew the door handles could become inoperable after a crash and was aware of fire hazards from the lithium-ion battery pack, but did nothing to address either issue. It also alleges that the Model 3 the couple had been driving had a defect that caused the sudden acceleration out of control, and that the automatic emergency braking system failed. Tesla’s door design has been targeted in lawsuits Tesla vehicles come with two built-in batteries: one for low-voltage power that controls interior functions like windows, doors, and the touchscreen, and the high-voltage pack that propels the car. Should the low-voltage battery die or be disabled, which is possible after a serious crash, the doors may not unlock and must be opened manually from the inside. Unfortunately, while Teslas come with manual releases, many owners and passengers reportedly don’t know where they are located or how to operate them. The problem is snowballing into a huge crisis, which has forced the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to start investigating whether some Tesla doors are defective, citing incidents in which exterior handles stopped working and trapped children and other occupants inside. Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla’s design chief, has said the company is working on a redesign of its door handles to make them more intuitive for occupants “in a panic situation.” However, that has not happened yet, and news of Tesla mishaps continues to filter in. The issue has even drawn the attention of Bloomberg’s news investigation team, which also reported there have been incidents in which people were seriously injured or died after they were unable to open doors following a loss of power, particularly after crashes. The latest lawsuit comes weeks after one was filed against Tesla in Wisconsin after a Model S crash killed five occupants who allegedly became trapped in a fast-moving inferno because the doors wouldn’t budge. Separately, Tesla was sued in October due to alleged defects in the doors of a crashed Cybertruck in Piedmont, California, that turned it into a “death trap” that prevented three college students from escaping before they died of smoke inhalation. Then in July, a lawsuit was filed on behalf of the sole survivor of a Tesla crash in Murrieta, California, in which three teenagers died. Despite the mounting cases, authorities have been slow on the uptake as far as the U.S. is concerned; however, in other countries, officials have been moving to remedy the problem. In China, a top regulator is reportedly considering a ban on fully concealed door handles, while in Europe, they have taken incremental measures to improve post-crash rescue and extrication protocols.

The publicly traded company informed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it suspended CEO Peter Tassiopoulos effective October 16, despite an internal email that reportedly revealed that the board placed him on temporary leave on September 4. That discrepancy is what securities law experts say could have violated federal disclosure rules. The September message, sent by Alt5 Sigma’s chief operations officer Ron Pitters and signed by director David Danziger, informed employees that a special board committee was investigating unspecified “certain matters concerning the company”. Chief revenue officer Vay Tham was also placed on leave, according to the email obtained by Forbes from two sources close to the company. Potential regulatory violations Under SEC regulations, public companies must file a Form 8-K within four business days when an executive officer effectively stops serving in their role. Sharing his insight on the matter, James Park, a securities law professor at UCLA, reportedly stated that materially false or misleading filings could violate federal anti-fraud provisions. “There is a high hurdle to establish such a violation,” Park noted, adding that prosecutors would need to prove intent and possibly harm to investors. Alan Palmiter, a professor emeritus of securities law at Wake Forest University, was more direct about the stakes. “Knowingly filing false, material information is a sure way to get into lots of trouble,” he said. “The question then is, first, whether the SEC has the guts to investigate. And here, maybe not.” An Alt5 Sigma spokesperson confirmed the board’s special committee is investigating matters, including a subsidiary’s legal troubles in Rwanda, where it was found criminally liable for illicit enrichment and money laundering. The company is appealing the verdict whilst claiming it was the victim of fraud. However, Alt5 Sigma did not provide answers to the questions of whether the Rwanda issue was the reason behind the executive suspensions, nor did it explain the discrepancy in the SEC filing date. The Trump connection The timing of potential regulatory problems is particularly sensitive given Alt5 Sigma’s deep ties to World Liberty Financial, the crypto venture co-founded by Donald Trump and his three sons. In August, Alt5 Sigma accumulated 7.28 billion WLFI tokens through a circular deal that reportedly routed an estimated $500 million to an entity affiliated with the president. A Trump-affiliated limited liability company owns approximately 38% of World Liberty Financial and is entitled to around 75% of proceeds from token sales. As of Friday morning, Alt5 Sigma’s WLFI token holdings were valued at approximately $894 million, more than four times the company’s $205 million market capitalization. The company’s stock has plummeted about 80% from $8.42 when the World Liberty deal was announced to $1.67 at Thursday’s close. What happens next? The SEC, now chaired by Trump appointee Paul Atkins, declined to comment on whether it would investigate the disclosure discrepancy. So far, there is no evidence of company insiders trading Alt5 Sigma shares during the six weeks between the internal September message and the October filing. Palmiter stated that while SEC action may be unlikely given the current political environment, private securities fraud class action lawsuits remain a possibility. “If there is a law firm interested in getting a little bit of lawyers’ fees, these securities fraud class actions are often prevalent,” he said. Tassiopoulos remains an Alt5 Sigma employee and board member, according to a World Liberty Financial attorney. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

54726207,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=856565,1763766000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/54726207.jpeg,"Crypto Crash Is A Forced Crypto Seller Unwind, Glassnode Co-Founders Claim",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-crashforced-crypto-seller-unwind/,"Glassnode co-founders Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, who publish under the @Negentropic handle on X, argue that the current crypto crash is being driven not by a broad narrative turn, but by a single, systematic source of sell pressure whose footprint is most visible in Bitcoin and is spilling into the wider complex. Their core assertion is categorical: “What’s happening in Bitcoin right now isn’t a narrative shift: it’s a mechanical unwind.” In that framing, the tape is reflecting the forced exit of one participant rather than an organic repricing of crypto risk. Why Is The Crypto Market Crashing? Negentropic’s thesis starts with momentum indicators behaving in ways they say are inconsistent with “natural markets.” They note that “the 1D MACD just printed a new all-time low… yet price is only down ~33% from the highs,” and add, “This doesn’t happen in natural markets. You only get this when someone is dumping in a straight line.” They pair that observation with capitulation-like oscillators that are not accompanied by the usual macro or leverage shock. As they put it, RSI is near capitulation, “but there’s no macro stress, no credit shock, no leverage detonation, no ETF outflows.” The mismatch matters to their conclusion: “It’s extreme momentum without a catalyst: classic signature of mechanical selling.” Related Reading: Crypto Traders See Bullish Tailwind: Hassett Jumps In Fed Chair Odds They then contrast today’s setup with prior episodes where MACD and RSI reached similar extremes. In those historical cases, Negentropic says, “Price was down 60%, derivatives were blowing out, funding was deeply negative.” By contrast, their read of the present is that confirming stress isn’t there. “ETFs remain net positive, their cost basis is still intact,” they write, and they emphasize that “long-term holders are removing supply aggressively.” They also point to cross-crypto resilience: “Solana ETF inflows are steady, altcoins are holding up relatively well vs btc & eth,” and “eth is holding stronger than btc.” For Negentropic, those relative-strength signals are the tell that this is not a systemwide risk-off event. “If this were real sentiment, all of that would be breaking. It isn’t,” they conclude. Flow regularity is the other pillar of the Glassnode co-founders’ case. They describe a pattern that they say has repeated since October 10: “Same timestamps, same venue-specific thinness, same lack of reflexive bids.” The implication is mechanical intent rather than discretionary trading. “It’s a schedule, not a market,” they write, claiming “21 days of consistent toxic flow.” That sequence, in their view, aligns with “one explanation”: “a liquidity provider or fund was structurally damaged on October 10th,” and “the entity tied to that failure has been reducing risk in a forced, rules-based manner.” Independent tape watchers are describing a remarkably similar cadence. Front Runners (@frontrunnersx) reports that a large seller on Binance has been hitting the market with clock-like consistency. Over “two weeks straight,” they say, the entity “hit the sell button exactly at 9:30 EST, every US market open, without fail.” They add that “kind of consistency usually points to a sophisticated actor operating under specific mandates or time windows,” and that it looks “less like random flow and more like a single entity (or a tightly-coordinated group).” Macro analyst Alex Krüger expands on how that could manifest across venues. He suggests the seller could be “dumping during US hours via a broker or OTC desk that employs smart order routing or hedging strategies across multiple venues.” In his view, the dominance of Binance prints doesn’t require Binance to be the origin. “Most volume naturally” would flow there, he argues, “since it’s where the bulk of the liquidity resides.” Related Reading: Crypto Market Wipes Out $1 Trillion Since October: Analyzing The Forces Behind The Crash Krüger also highlights venue asymmetries that fit a routed-flow story: he has seen “relatively little spot selling routed via Coinbase this week,” while noting “extraordinary levels of spot selling via Bitfinex.” Will The Crypto Crash Be Short-Lived? Delphi Ventures founding partner Tommy Shaughnessy focuses on the urgency implied by the pace. If the flow has been present since 10/10, he writes, “the speed at which they’re selling BTC is pretty crazy.” He interprets that as compulsion rather than strategy: “Means they are price insensitive and need to exit, fast.” Shaughnessy characterizes the move as “violent,” but adds a key qualifier consistent with Negentropic’s finite-seller framing: it’s likely “short lived because it’s not orderly.” If there is a body from 10/10 the speed at which they’re selling $BTC is pretty crazy Means they are price insensitive and need to exit, fast. (Someone had that chart of all red candles for days) Violent but means it’s hopefully short lived because it’s not orderly https://t.co/kaJAKh5Z4M — Tommy (@Shaughnessy119) November 21, 2025 Multicoin Capital founder Tushar Jain likewise describes what he sees as forced liquidation behavior. “It feels like a big forced seller is in the market,” he writes, adding, “We are seeing systematic selling during specific hours.” Jain explicitly ties this to the same October window Negentropic flags, calling it “probably a consequence of 10/10 liquidations,” and says it’s “hard to imagine this scale of forced selling continues for much longer.” He also situates the moment within a longer unwind process, recalling a lesson from prior cycles: “it takes some time for all the bankruptcies to reveal themselves after a big liquidation flush like this,” because “shops are running around trying to figure out what their exposure to insolvent counterparties is.” It feels like a big forced seller is in the market. We are seeing systematic selling during specific hours. Probably a consequence of 10/10 liquidations. Hard to imagine this scale of forced selling continues for much longer. https://t.co/JO6kRmJUUb — Tushar Jain (@tushar_jain) November 19, 2025 Taken together, the sources are presenting a coherent, internally consistent read: crypto’s downside is being dominated by a single, time-boxed, price-insensitive seller whose execution pattern is systematic enough to warp momentum indicators and intraday structure. Negentropic’s bottom line is not merely descriptive but interpretive: “This is not capitulation. This is not a trend break.” It is, instead, “a constrained unwinding through a fractured market.” And because mechanical sellers end when inventory or mandate ends, the Glassnode co-founders argue that when it does, “the rebound will likely be far sharper than the decline that preceded it.” At press time, the total crypto market cap was at $2.83 trillion.

54726211,632259,1763766015,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54726211.jpeg,Cardano Founder Reveals Midnight Launch Roadmap,https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-midnight-launch-roadmap/,"At the Midnight Summit, Cardano founder and Input Output Global CEO Charles Hoskinson set out a staged rollout for Midnight, a privacy-and-identity network he describes as crypto’s next generational layer. In a Dapp Central interview , he positioned Midnight as an extender of existing ecosystems rather than a competitor: “We’re here to make your life easier and allow you to do new things your network doesn’t do… and you can pay in that network’s token,” pointing to interoperability with major chains such as Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin and XRP. Cardano Sidechain Launches In Four Stages Hoskinson’s deployment plan is a four-gate launch intended to move from distribution to full decentralization through sequential upgrades. The first gate is liquidity and token delivery. The Cardano founder said NIGHT claims and initial market trading begin on December 8, 2025, the point at which Midnight becomes price-discoverable: “They get the tokens, they can trade them on exchanges and DEXes… it creates a price signal it’s on CoinMarketCap, it’s a real thing.” He tied this to the Glacier Drop and Scavenger Mine funnels, estimating participation at “well more than a million users,” while acknowledging wallet counts don’t map cleanly to individuals. The second gate is a federated mainnet targeted for Q1 2026. Hoskinson described a production environment with mixed operators—some nodes run by IOG and some by external enterprises, including a Fortune 500 participant—so Midnight’s builder base can deploy applications with real users before final decentralization. He cited more than 100 partners already building for Midnight, and summit materials likewise list federated mainnet as the next milestone after NIGHT liquidity. The third gate is an incentivized testnet to onboard stake pool operators and validate Midnight’s final consensus protocol. Hoskinson said the protocol has formal liveness and safety proofs and targets roughly 5,000 transactions per second with sub-second blocks, but has never been deployed on Substrate. “It would be irresponsible just to kind of launch that out,” he said, arguing that both the algorithm and operator tooling must be proven under incentives before mainnet adoption. The fourth gate follows once the incentivized testnet is stable: a hard fork into the final mainnet consensus and a completed end-to-end network. The Cardano founder expects this phase to coincide with broad exchange access and a transition from Cardano-adjacent rollout to general cross-chain privacy services: “Midnight wakes up… to a Midnight-Ethereum, Midnight-Solana, Midnight-Bitcoin […] Midnight-XRP .” In his framing, this is when Midnight becomes a neutral privacy layer that other ecosystems consume rather than a single-community product. Midnight’s adoption strategy hinges on dual-token economics. NIGHT holders generate DUST , a consumable fuel for computation. Through a “capacity exchange,” DUST can be sold for other chains’ tokens or delegated by DApp builders so users can interact without first buying crypto. Hoskinson framed this as importing Web2’s frictionless payment expectation into Web3: “If you have NIGHT […] your users […] can use your DApp for free without having a token […] That’s an entirely new thing in the cryptocurrency space.” Hoskinson also argued that AI makes privacy economically existential. He said models are “hoovering up… your likeness and your output,” enabling uncompensated digital replicas and accelerating job displacement: “People realize this is existential now […] it’s I no longer have a job.” In response, Midnight’s selective-disclosure stack is meant to let users reclaim data ownership and use zero-knowledge proofs to verify properties—such as humanity or eligibility—without revealing identity, countering what he described as bot-heavy online participation. Governance is presented as a correction to Cardano’s institutional friction. Hoskinson said Midnight’s code governance will be housed at the Linux Foundation and executed by a KPI-driven Midnight Foundation, aiming for clearer accountability and faster delivery. Hoskinson summarized the endpoint as a “crypto triumvirate”: “Bitcoin is the trust and value layer […] Cardano the computation layer […] Midnight the privacy and identity layer.” If the four gates land as described—December 8 liquidity, Q1 2026 federated mainnet, Q2 2026 incentivized testnet, then a final mainnet hard fork—Midnight’s cross-ecosystem privacy thesis will move from roadmap to live infrastructure through 2026.

Trading volume has surged 48% to nearly $9 billion in the past 24 hours, now making up 8% of XRP’s circulating supply. Momentum is now deeply oversold. The Relative Strength Index has crashed to 24 on lower time frames, a level that often precedes short-term bounces. If XRP holds here and forms a double bottom, the path to recovery could target the $2.30 zone, offering a potential 21% rebound from current prices.

This explosive growth signals a fundamental shift in how enterprises are embracing artificial intelligence for customer service operations. How Sierra AI is Revolutionizing Enterprise Customer Service Sierra’s rapid ascent to $100 million ARR demonstrates the massive demand for intelligent AI solutions in the enterprise space. The company’s AI agents are handling complex customer interactions that previously required human intervention, from healthcare patient authentication to mortgage applications and credit card replacements. The Power Behind Sierra AI’s Customer Service Transformation Founded by industry veterans Bret Taylor and Clay Bavor, Sierra AI brings together decades of tech expertise. Taylor’s background includes co-creating Google Maps, founding FriendFeed, serving as Facebook’s CTO, and co-leading Salesforce. Bavor spent 18 years at Google overseeing products like Gmail and Google Drive. Enterprise AI Adoption Reaches Tipping Point What surprised even the founders was the breadth of industry adoption. While tech companies like Deliveroo, Discord, and Rivian were expected early adopters, traditional businesses including ADT, Bissell, Vans, Cigna, and SiriusXM have also embraced Sierra’s AI agents. Customer Type Examples Use Cases Tech Companies Deliveroo, Discord, Ramp, Rivian, SoFi, Tubi Customer support, order processing, technical assistance Traditional Enterprises ADT, Bissell, Vans, Cigna, SiriusXM Patient authentication, returns processing, mortgage applications Bret Taylor’s Vision for AI-Driven Business Transformation Taylor and Bavor’s partnership dates back to 2005 when Taylor hired Bavor at Google. Their combined experience in building scalable consumer and enterprise products has positioned Sierra AI as a category leader in the competitive AI customer service market. Why AI Agents Are Becoming Essential for Modern Businesses Sierra’s success highlights several key advantages of AI-powered customer service: 24/7 Availability : AI agents provide round-the-clock support without human limitations Cost Efficiency : Outcomes-based pricing model charges only for completed work Scalability : Handles fluctuating demand without additional hiring Consistency : Delivers uniform service quality across all interactions Competitive Landscape and Market Position While facing competition from startups like Decagon and Intercom, Sierra claims leadership in the AI customer service category. The company’s recent $350 million funding round led by Greenoaks Capital valued Sierra at $10 billion, representing a 100x revenue multiple based on current ARR. Investment Backing and Future Growth Trajectory Sierra’s investor roster reads like a who’s who of venture capital, including Sequoia, Benchmark, ICONIQ, and Thrive Capital. This strong financial backing, combined with the company’s innovative outcomes-based pricing model, positions Sierra for continued rapid expansion. Frequently Asked Questions What is Sierra AI’s current valuation? Sierra was last valued at $10 billion following a $350 million funding round in September. Who are Sierra AI’s founders? The company was founded by Bret Taylor , former Salesforce co-CEO, and Clay Bavor , Google veteran who led products like Gmail and Google Drive. What types of customers use Sierra AI? Customers range from tech companies like Deliveroo , Discord , and Rivian to traditional businesses including ADT , Bissell , and Cigna . How does Sierra AI’s pricing work? The company uses an outcomes-based model, charging customers for completed work rather than flat subscription fees. What makes Sierra AI different from competitors? Sierra focuses on building AI agents that handle complex, multi-step customer service tasks rather than simple chatbot interactions. The Future of AI in Enterprise Customer Service Sierra’s remarkable $100 million ARR achievement in under two years demonstrates that AI transformation in customer service is no longer a future possibility but a present reality. As businesses across all sectors recognize the efficiency and scalability benefits of AI agents, companies like Sierra are positioned to redefine how enterprises interact with their customers. The speed of adoption and diverse industry penetration suggests we’re witnessing just the beginning of a fundamental shift in business operations.

Bitcoin and Ethereum have dropped by 10% in 24 hours, while some major altcoins (e.g., Sui, Aptos, Pump.fun) have suffered losses in excess of 15%. These falls come as stock markets in the United States and elsewhere wobble in the face of AI-related uncertainty, and in response to fears that the Federal Reserve may hold off cutting interest rates. However, while this may be bad news in the near term, this article takes a closer look at PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , which we’ve selected as the best altcoin coin to buy for anyone wanting to make gains during the current bear market. Best Altcoin Coin to Buy During the Crypto Crash – 21 November Running on the Ethereum blockchain, PEPENODE isn’t simply another run-of-the-mill meme coin, but rather a mine-to-earn token that gives holders the opportunity to mine without having to invest in expensive equipment and hardware. Calm hands. Sharp focus. Full bags https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/31MHQsE8GZ — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) November 21, 2025 It opened its presale in late September and has now raised $2.1 million from enthusiastic investors, who are buying into its roadmap. As a mine-to-earn token, it enables users to build and run their own virtual mining rig, which they can grow by spending PEPENODE tokens on more virtual mining nodes. More nodes result in greater rewards, with PEPENODE issuing mining rewards in the form of third-party tokens such as Fartcoin and the original Pepe. This mining platform provides a strong incentive to acquire PEPENODE, meaning that the token could attract massive demand once its platform launches. If that weren’t enough, it also benefits from an attractive staking system, which currently pays an annual yield of 593%. This could make PEPENODE a hugely lucrative token to own and hold, which perhaps accounts for why its presale has been gaining momentum in recent weeks. PEPENODE Could Be One of the Biggest Altcoins of 2026 Given PEPENODE’s tokenomics, it has every chance of surging once it lists in the near future. It will have a max supply of 210 billion tokens, which it will allocate between its treasury, development, node rewards, listings, and marketing. Investors can join its presale now by going to its official website , where they can connect a compatible wallet (e.g., Best Wallet) and buy the token at the current price of $0.0011592. This price rises every three days until the sale ends, so interested buyers should act sooner rather than later, so that they can lock in the biggest potential return. While the market is currently in a bad position, PEPENODE has the potential to make gains even in a bearish climate, which is why it’s our best altcoin coin to buy right now. And in a more positive environment, it could take off in 2026.

The platform now accepts ETH as collateral, a move that could strengthen bullish Ethereum price predictions in the weeks ahead. Previously available only to Bitcoin holders, the loan product now allows eligible users to borrow up to $1 million in USDC without selling their ETH. If you believe in somΞTHing, this one's for you. ETH-backed loans are here. You can borrow USDC against your Ethereum, unlocking liquidity without selling. Available now in the U.S. (ex. NY). pic.twitter.com/eOvJ2BWPfr — Coinbase (@coinbase) November 20, 2025 The integration aims to serve long-term holders seeking liquidity for expenses such as down payments or debt refinancing, without creating a taxable event. A service that has been seeing increasing demand this cycle. Crypto-collateralized lending hit a record $73.6 billion in Q3, according to a Galaxy Research report . Coinbase’s BTC-backed loans alone have already facilitated over $1.27 billion in borrowing and $1.38 billion in collateral from roughly 16,000 customers, according to company data . For Ethereum, this strengthens its broader financial appeal by helping bridge TradFi and DeFi. The structure mirrors traditional securities-backed credit lines, making ETH a more dependable balance-sheet asset for institutions. Ethereum Price Predictions: Institutions Could Save the ETH Downtrend This long-term holding incentive could help stabilize price movements against recent market headwinds, particularly as ETH navigates a potential bullish head-and-shoulder pattern. A historical demand zone around $2,750 stands as a potential bottom to the right shoulder, particularly as momentum indicators flash a reversal. ETH / USD 1-day chart, bullish head-and-shoulder pattern. Source: TradingView. The RSI has hit the 30 oversold threshold, a typical bottom marker as sellers reach exhaustion and buyers step in. The MACD confirms weakening sell pressure, flattening below the signal line in the early stages of a trend shift. A fully realised pattern breakout could see the neckline reclaimed around $5,500 , surpassing past all-time highs into new price discovery with a 100% move. But as the bull market matures, if Ethereum continues to feature on mainstream balance sheets through corporate treasuries and ETF accumulation, the push could extend 365% to $10,000 . PepeNode: A New Way to Make Passive Crypto Mining Income With the market at a standstill, investors are seeking more reliable income strategies that don’t hinge on market sentiment. With PepeNode ($PEPENODE) , the process is a simple mine-to-earn (M2E) game. No hardware needed. Just log in, buy virtual nodes , stack rigs, and start earning passive rewards across top-performing meme coins. Momentum is climbing fast. The presale has already passed $2.1 million, while early stakers are still earning up to 593% APY. And thanks to a built-in deflationary model, where 70% of all $PEPENODE spent on nodes and rigs is burned, scarcity supports long-term token value. PepeNode stands out as a smarter way to capture some of the market’s strongest upside—without worrying about timing the perfect entry.

Here’s What’s Coming,https://timestabloid.com/bloomberg-november-24-is-special-day-for-xrp-heres-whats-coming/,"Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart has released a revised projection for when the remaining spot XRP exchange-traded funds might begin trading in the United States. Interest in these products has intensified following the recent introduction of the Canary XRP ETF (XRPC) and the Bitwise XRP ETF (XRP), both of which have generated significant attention from market participants anticipating broader institutional access to the asset. Projected Debut Dates for Grayscale and Franklin Templeton Products Seyffart addressed the potential timeline for upcoming funds from Grayscale and Franklin Templeton after new filings from the two issuers hinted at progress. In a recent post on X, he stated that his current expectation is for the Grayscale XRP ETF (GXRP), which is transitioning from an existing trust structure, to begin trading on Monday, November 24, 2025. He added that Franklin Templeton’s proposed XRP ETF (EZRP) could also become available on the same date, although he emphasized that this remains a probable rather than guaranteed outcome. Our base case is that @Grayscale 's XRP ETF will go live on Monday the 24th. So will the Grayscale Dogecoin ETF. And I think the @FTI_US XRP ETF could go live on Monday the 24th as well. Lots happening next week. https://t.co/TkA6EE0D6T — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) November 19, 2025 The updated forecast follows several procedural steps by both firms. Grayscale initially revealed plans at the beginning of the year to convert its long-running XRP Trust into an exchange-traded fund. The firm later submitted an amended filing on November 3 aimed at accelerating the conversion through the Form 8-A mechanism. This approach allows the issuer to move forward without waiting for explicit SEC approval, provided that the required 20-day period elapses without intervention. Based on that timeline, the earliest feasible launch date aligns with Seyffart’s November 24 estimate. Franklin Templeton made similar adjustments to its application. Its November 4 amendment removed the language that would have automatically delayed effectiveness, a change that positioned the firm to target the same launch window as Grayscale. Seyffart also noted that Grayscale’s proposed Dogecoin ETF could debut on the same day, potentially making that week one of the busiest in the digital asset ETF landscape in recent months. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Status of Pending Applications from Other Issuers A number of additional asset managers have also filed for spot XRP ETFs, but their launch dates remain uncertain. Companies such as 21Shares, CoinShares, and WisdomTree still await regulatory clearance, and none of the three have taken the procedural steps that would allow their applications to become effective without direct approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In particular, CoinShares and WisdomTree have retained the deferral language in their S-1 documents, and 21Shares preserved the same provision even after its November 7 update. As a result, none of these products is expected to reach the market until the SEC grants explicit authorization. While several issuers await further progress, the two spot XRP ETFs already trading in the U.S. continue to attract investor interest. Combined net inflows into these products have reached $410.76 million. The majority originates from Canary’s XRPC, which has accumulated $305.40 million. Bitwise’s fund, which launched only recently, has drawn $105.36 million so far. The growing number of filings and the rapid asset growth of early entrants indicate sustained institutional demand for regulated exposure to XRP. The coming weeks are positioned to shape expectations for how quickly additional products may join the market, particularly if Seyffart’s projected timeline proves accurate.

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/7-7-billion-in-xrp-in-three-months-heres-what-happened/,"New data from the XRP rich list shows that large investors have significantly increased their positions since August, adding more than $7.7 billion worth of the asset during a period marked by declining prices and weakened market confidence. While some market participants reduced exposure during the downturn, the largest holders have steadily grown their balances, indicating a sustained accumulation phase. Whale Activity During a Prolonged Market Decline XRP has been under persistent selling pressure since mid-July 2025, following its peak price of $3.66. The asset has continued to record lower highs for three consecutive months, and its current valuation of $1.89 reflects a 48% decline from its July high. This extended drawdown has contributed to a largely negative sentiment among retail investors. However, on-chain metrics reveal that substantial holders have adopted a markedly different approach. Instead of reducing their exposure, many of the largest wallets have expanded their positions during the price drop. Data compiled from the community-maintained rich list indicates broad-based accumulation among major holders, with particularly strong activity among accounts holding tens or hundreds of millions of tokens. Increase in Balances Among Large XRP Whales Wallets containing between 20 million and 500 million XRP tokens have shown the most pronounced growth. When these wallet segments were last reviewed on August 21, they collectively held 17.378 billion tokens, representing more than a quarter of the circulating supply at that time. Within that group, 159 addresses held between 20 million and 100 million XRP, with a combined balance of 6.315 billion tokens. Another 55 addresses contained between 100 million and 500 million XRP, accounting for 11.063 billion XRP. Current figures show notable expansion. There are now 215 wallets in the 20–100 million XRP category, and their total holdings have risen to 10.021 billion. This increase amounts to 3.706 billion additional XRP, valued at approximately $7.11 billion based on the prevailing price. Balances in the 100–500 million XRP bracket have also risen. While the number of wallets in this group has not changed, their collective holdings now stand at 11.385 billion XRP. This reflects an increase of 364 million tokens, equivalent to roughly $698 million at current market rates. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Combined, these large whale categories have accumulated 4.07 billion XRP in just three months, holdings now valued at roughly $7.81 billion. As a result, they currently control approximately 21.406 billion XRP, accounting for 35.5% of the circulating supply. Accumulation Trends Among Smaller Address Tiers Although the largest wallets show the most dramatic growth, several smaller address groups have also expanded their positions. Holders with 20 to 500 XRP have increased their combined total from 210 million to 215 million XRP. Addresses containing 1,000 to 5,000 XRP collectively added nearly 7 million XRP over the same period. The pattern of accumulation is even more pronounced among mid-sized wallets. Addresses holding between 10,000 and 25,000 XRP have increased their combined balance by more than 113 million XRP in the last quarter. Several other categories between 5,000 and 100,000 XRP have also recorded steady increases, reinforcing the broader trend of accumulation despite prevailing market conditions. While many investor groups have expanded their holdings, not all high-value addresses followed the same trajectory. Wallets containing between 500 million and 1 billion XRP reduced their combined balances by more than 2.1 billion tokens since late August. In contrast, the largest category, wallets with at least 1 billion XRP, has expanded by over 1.5 billion tokens during the same timeframe.

According to Santiment analytics, wallets holding between one million and ten million tokens were the primary contributors, adding significant sell-side liquidity to an already fragile market. This sudden influx of supply arrived at a time when XRP was already battling bearish sentiment across the broader crypto space. The asset slipped 10.32% in 24 hours, falling below the key $2 psychological level, touching lows near $1.85, and posting double-digit losses within a single day. XRP's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview Extreme Fear Grips the Market Market indicators paint a grim picture. XRP is trading below both its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages, signalling sustained downward momentum. The Fear & Greed Index sits at 14, firmly in “extreme fear” territory, while selling volume surged past $7.2 billion in 24 hours. Analysts warn that a failure to reclaim resistance near $2.30 could open the door to deeper losses, with short-term projections suggesting a potential drop toward $1.50 if bearish pressure continues. The weakness is not isolated to XRP. Bitcoin’s retreat below the $85,000 zone and Ethereum’s slide below $3,000 have triggered market-wide liquidations, with macro uncertainty adding fuel. Concerns over a possible delay in Federal Reserve rate cuts, driven by soft U.S. jobs data and rising unemployment, have dented investor appetite for risk assets across the board. Will XRP Stabilize or Sink Further? The big question now is whether whales will continue distributing or pause their offloading. If no new wave of large-scale selling emerges, analysts believe XRP could stabilize and attempt to reclaim the $2 mark in the coming sessions. Recovery projections place the short-term target between $2.50 and $2.70, though this would require a decisive break above long-standing resistance. Medium-term predictions remain cautiously optimistic but restrained. Many experts expect XRP to trade between $1.96 and $2.27 into the end of 2025, with stronger upside momentum unlikely until regulatory clarity and upcoming ETF activity begin shaping demand heading into 2026.

Kiyosaki noted that the sale averaged around $90,000, and that he acquired these assets years ago at around $6,000 per coin. Kiyosaki plans to use the cash to purchase two surgical centers and invest in a billboard advertising business. He expects these investments to generate a monthly tax-exempt cash flow of approximately $27,500 starting in February of next year. The renowned author stated that he already has real estate investments that have been generating positive cash flow for years, and that the new revenues will “further strengthen his position.” Related News: Is Bitcoin Receiving Another Blow from Japan This Time?

This happened during a violent market correction that blindsided traders across the United States and Asia, which dragged Bitcoin down to about $80,500 on Friday, putting the token on track for its worst month since Terra’s collapse in 2022 wiped out $60 billion and triggered the bankruptcies that later pulled FTX under. Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin holdings. Source: Arkham Intelligence/X The broader market lost around half a trillion dollars in Bitcoin value during these past weeks. Even though Bitcoin is still up compared to the pre-election low it hit before President Donald Trump returned to the White House last November, most of that early rally has evaporated during his first year back in office. This time, the pain is hitting new players too. Exchange-traded funds brought in retail traders and Wall Street firms, but those same positions are now under pressure as prices keep sliding. Institutional exits sabotage Bitcoin The trigger for this slide hasn’t been clear. The new ETF structure didn’t exist during previous crashes. But funds tied to Bitcoin saw billions flow out this month, with buyers such as Harvard’s endowment and hedge funds pulling back. Digital-asset treasury companies (those publicly traded companies modeled after Michael Saylor’s Strategy) faced even heavier withdrawals. Investors are questioning why a corporate shell holding coins should be valued above the tokens it owns. Crypto’s investor base has expanded far beyond long-term enthusiasts willing to HODL through storms. Now the market includes institutional players who don’t hesitate to cut risk. Fadi Aboualfa, head of research at Copper Technologies, said, “What’s happened these last two months was like rocket fuel, as if people were expecting this to crash. That’s what institutional investors do. They’re not there to hold, they don’t have that mentality. They rebalance their portfolio.” Even after the plunge, Bitcoin remains up about 50% from its pre-election low. But this decline is far smaller than the 75% crash during the 2021–2022 bear market, a period that exposed many major failures, including Celsius, BlockFi, and Three Arrows. Tracking the liquidity strains weighing crypto down This selloff didn’t start with fraud or a new scandal. Some traders think it’s driven by weak liquidity, technical pressure, and shaken confidence. Luke Youngblood, founder of Moonwell, said : “We aren’t following the same path down; overall macro conditions, government support, and fewer bad actors in the space make today’s market more resilient. The foundations crypto is building on are stronger, even if there are causes for concern down the line.” The key event was a flash crash on October 10, when $19 billion in leveraged bets was liquidated within hours. Weak weekend liquidity and too much leverage on certain exchanges pushed Bitcoin off its peak of $126,251 reached days earlier. Cantor analysts Brett Knoblauch and Gareth Gacetta wrote, “It feels as if some big players in the space are being forced to sell, as what happened on 10/10 might have had a far-larger impact on balance sheets than initially thought.” Liquidity is still thin. Market makers weakened by the crash can’t always support prices. Another $1.6 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated on Friday as the latest drop hit traders. Bitcoin’s “digital gold” image faded while actual gold held steady. Crypto is trading like a pure risk asset again. This week, Bitcoin tangled with volatile trading in tech stocks. The S&P 500 jumped early Thursday on strong Nvidia earnings, then recorded its biggest intraday reversal since the April tariff turbulence. Analysts at Nomura linked part of the move to crypto. Bill Ackman said Fannie and Freddie holdings behaved like a crypto proxy. The market is tied to AI-driven optimism, and any fear can spark selling. Inside crypto, risk is rising as companies try to copy Michael Saylor’s treasury model. If confidence breaks, forced selling could follow, especially since many holders are already underwater. Adam Morgan McCarthy from Kaiko said, “When you’ve got a medical device company or a cancer research firm rebranding as a crypto treasury, it’s a sign of where you are in the cycle.” Sentiment keeps sliding. The Fear and Greed Index dropped to 11 out of 100, showing extreme fear. Chris Newhouse from Ergonia said, “Fear sentiment has spiked to relative highs while structural demand for spot remains notably absent, leaving the market without the natural buyers typically present during significant corrections.” Join Bybit now and claim a $50 bonus in minutes",News|BTC|Gold|USD,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-22 14:30:00

Our ENA price prediction expects a maximum of $0.82 in 2025. In 2031, we expect the ENA price to achieve $7.38. Ethena is a stablecoin project built on Ethereum that offers USDe, a fully decentralized coin pegged to the US dollar. Unlike stablecoins such as USDC or USDT, USDe doesn’t depend on banks or centralized companies for reserves. Instead, it uses a cash-and-carry trading strategy to keep its value equal to the dollar. For investors who prioritize decentralization, USDe could be an appealing choice — especially since it currently offers staking rewards above 9%. However, critics caution that since the project is still new, it’s uncertain whether USDe’s high yields and dollar peg can remain stable during a market downturn. Based on these developments, we’ve compiled our Ethena price prediction from 2025-2031. In this article, we’ll find out “Will ENA reach $10?” and explore the factors behind ENA price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethena Ticker ENA Price $0.23 (-4.5%) Market cap $3.59 Trading volume (24-hour) $457M Circulating supply 7.15B ENA All-time high $1.52 (11 April, 2024) All-time low $0.1858 (11 October, 2025) ENA technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.23 Price Prediction $ 0.2240 (-1.24%) Fear & Greed Index 42 (Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 13.66% (Very High) Green Days 11/30 (37%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.5147 200-Day SMA $ 0.4819 14-Day RSI 32.19 (Neutral) ENA price analysis Resistance for ENA is at $0.2505 Support for ENA/USD is at $0.218 The ENA price analysis for November 22 confirms that ENA witnessed bearish pressure as it declines toward $0.227. Currently, the ENA price is preparing for a bearish rally. Ethena price analysis 1-day chart: ENA price triggers bearish momentum Analyzing the daily price chart of ENA tokens, ENA witnessed a bearish correction after sellers pushed the price toward support lines. Sellers are now aiming for a hold below the immediate Fib channels around $0.227. The 24-hour volume surged to $33.9 million, showing a surge in interest in trading today. Ethena’s price is currently trading at $0.23, which has dropped by over 4.5% in the last 24 hours. ENA/USDT Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and hovers within the neutral level at 27, showing that bears control price momentum slightly. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. ENA/USDT 4-hour price chart: Buyers aim big above EMA levels The 4-hour ENA price chart suggests that ENA experienced a bearish activity around EMA lines, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart. Currently, buyers aim for a strong rebound above the EMA20 trend line. ENA/USDT Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a bullish region at 0.03, suggesting that buyers are trying to build pressure near resistance levels and boost upward correction. However, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening selling positions. ENA price predictions: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.4590 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.4286 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.4654 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.4656 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.5147 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.6009 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.4819 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.4700 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.5112 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.5680 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.6112 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.5906 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.5263 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.4938 SELL What to expect from ENA price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the ENA price from an immediate surge. However, if the ENA price successfully breaks above $0.2505, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.2866. ENA/USDT Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, ENA price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.218, resulting in a correction to $0.2003. Is ENA a good investment? Whether ENA is a good investment depends on your goals and how much risk you’re comfortable with. Ethena has been ranked among the 100 cryptocurrencies. Still, there are questions about its demand, given its similarity to algorithmic stablecoins — a concept that lost trust after LUNA’s collapse in 2022. Even so, Ethena has shown strong performance during market surges, making it a solid project in the crypto market. If you believe in the project’s future and don’t mind the ups and downs, it might be worth putting in a small amount. Why is the ENA price down today? ENA’s price gained selling pressure around recent highs, resulting in a minor downward push. This created a decline toward $0.23. Will Ethena price recover? If buyers hold above the $0.3 level, we might see a comeback in buying demand. Will ENA reach $10? ENA price might reach the $10 mark in 2032 if buying demand surges and ENA attracts altcoin investors. Will ENA reach $100? The $100 mark is a distant dream for ENA. This price level is achievable in the long run if ENA continues to expand its offerings and attract buying demand. Is Ethena a good long-term investment? ENA has gained popularity due to strong community support. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment. Recent news/ Opinion on ENA Terminal Finance, a decentralized exchange (DEX) incubated by Ethena Labs, has attracted more than $262 million in total value locked (TVL) ahead of its upcoming launch. Ethena (ENA) price prediction November 2025 Over the last few days, ENA prices have aimed to surge above crucial Fib levels. If the BTC price aims for a hold above $120K in November, we might see a solid surge in the ENA price. According to technical analysis, the ENA price might record a maximum level of $0.44 and a minimum of $0.25, with an average value of $0.35 throughout November.

ENA historical price sentiment ENA Price History: Coinmarketcap Ethena’s price history from mid-2024 to late 2025 shows a period of intense volatility marked by sharp fluctuations in both price and market capitalization. In early 2024, Ethena traded strongly, reaching highs around $1.20 in April, supported by high trading volumes exceeding $8 billion. However, by mid-2024, the token began to decline steadily, closing near $0.38 by July as investor sentiment weakened and market activity cooled. The latter half of 2024 saw further instability. Ethena’s price dropped as low as $0.20 in September, reflecting a major correction phase in the broader crypto market. Despite these setbacks, the token demonstrated resilience, climbing back above $1.00 by December 2024. This late-year rally suggested renewed interest from traders and potential ecosystem developments. In 2025, Ethena continued to experience wide swings. The token opened the year near $1.25 but faced sustained downward pressure through the spring, dipping below $0.30 by June. A strong recovery followed in the third quarter, with prices surpassing $0.70 in August and stabilizing near $0.50 by October.

Look Outside Of AI But Stay Invested,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846878-hunting-for-ai-bubbles-look-outside-but-stay-invested?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"Summary Nvidia delivered a stellar Q3 FY26 report, yet market volatility reflects rising concerns about broader macro fears rather than an AI bubble. Recent market jitters stem from global liquidity concerns, rising US dollar, and crypto liquidations, not fundamental weaknesses in AI or tech. Current market pullback presents attractive entry points in AI names, Mag 7 stocks, semiconductors, and select networking and software names. Investors should focus on macro factors—liquidity, interest rates, and central bank actions—while remaining rational & pragmatic in AI-related opportunities. Investment Thesis Despite literally crushing every expectation in the Q3 FY26 ER, Nvidia’s ( NVDA ) Huang appeared bewildered at the market’s volatile reaction to the company’s shares at an all-hands meeting yesterday , where he reportedly said: ""If we delivered a bad quarter, it is evidence there's an AI bubble. If we delivered a great quarter, we are fueling the AI bubble."" It’s not just Jensen Huang. Almost every investor (including myself) in this market feels as bewildered with the eruptive sentiment surrounding AI. Accounting 101 masterclasses from Michael Burry don’t help soothe the sentiment further. But at such times, I believe a deeper and more fundamental peek beneath the hoods of arguments is warranted. Per my observations over the past month or so, there have been a few macro events that have silently crept up, causing a few jitters in the shadows, leading to AI taking the fall for these macro jitters, pushing deep fear in the markets. I strongly believe this fear has created new opportunities for investors to get back into the AI game, leading me to be bullish on the entire stock market. Its Not AI Silly, Look On The Outside Of AI To start with, I have to give it to Dr. Michael Burry and his timing of the AI bubble warning . That was followed up by the quarterly 13F filing showing his now viral puts against Nvidia and Palantir and a series of tweets like the one I hyperlinked to in the section above. In reality, problems in the markets started a month before Dr. Burry’s opinions divided the markets, and crypto markets felt the initial reverberations. Exhibit A: Markets kept ignoring fringe systemic risks that were on the horizon in alternate markets complicated by the rise of the USD. (TradingView) A new tariff threat on China on October 10 kindled intense speculation among risk assets, with crypto feeling the brunt of it. That particular tariff threat sparked probably the largest liquidation of crypto assets, especially in Bitcoin, with almost about $19B in digital assets being liquidated . Plus, the US dollar ( DXY ) had continued its upward trend that started in mid-September this year, reaching ~$99 around that time. Currently DXY sits at $100 and remains range bound. Every investor knows by now that a relatively rising dollar is not good for tech companies since it diminishes the value of their revenue base. Markets continued to ignore these threats in the crypto markets and from the advancing dollar while balancing a very thin line between diverging theories about AI bubbles. Ironically, Sam Altman was one of the first proponents , starting in August this year. Since August, many tech voices have either raised concerns or butted heads against these concerns about the AI bubble. Within the Mag 7 complex, Microsoft’s ( MSFT ) Satya Nadella remains optimistic on AI investments, saying that “their biggest problem was not a glut of data centers, but a lack of them.” This week, Alphabet’s ( GOOG ) Sundar Pichai echoed similar sentiments , calling the AI investments an ""extraordinary moment,"" while still warning there were some ""elements of irrationality"" in this AI boom. In addition to these views, fears about the circular financing stemming from the trillion-dollar capex commitments that OpenAI was announcing almost every other day were adding more concern than optimism. In my view, the glamour of Big Tech, OpenAI, and all its capex commitments and circular financing was masking another issue creeping up underneath. Fears of the Japanese yen ( USD:JPY ) carry trades unwinding, complicated by the rise of the DXY as I noted earlier, were adding more pressure to the overall global liquidity environment, which is extremely crucial to stock markets but even more important for high beta assets and digital assets, like I explained in my post this week on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). I increasingly view Bitcoin as the leading indicator of global liquidity in the markets, so if Bitcoin sells off, it would pay to watch for signs of structural imbalances in the economy even if it means outside of AI. This is what happened so far through much of October and November, including the day that Nvidia reported a robust Q3 ER this week. Markets should actually have jumped on Nvidia’s Q3 ER, and it actually did during after-market hours on Nov 19 and pre-market hours on Nov 20. But liquidations in the crypto market surged to almost $1 billion in a 24-hour window, which is extremely large and abnormal, which confused many investors on Thursday, including Nvidia’s Jensen Huang. I do expect the current liquidity crunch to improve in a few weeks and believe investors should think rationally rather than giving in to fears about AI bubbles. As I explain below, the fears from the current rout have led to quite a few opportunities within the AI ecosystem that are now extremely appealing once again. Segregating Market’s Fears From Rational Investment Opportunities In the past ~2 months, as fears and confusion intensified in the markets, the S&P 500’s forward earnings multiple reached the higher end, >23x. As per the latest data released yesterday , the S&P 500 now trades at a forward multiple of 21.5x, retreating ~8% from its October high of 23.4x. The current PE multiple also trades ~6% higher than its 5-year average of 20x. Further, the S&P 500 trades at the same PE it traded at the start of this year , at 21.5x. Exhibit B: S&P 500 forward PE has come down to ~21.5x closer to its 5 year average of 20x (Macromicro) But when it comes to EPS estimates, analysts project the S&P 500 to report ~11% growth in EPS this year to ~$270.6 per share. In the past 5 years, the S&P 500 has grown its EPS by a ~6-8% CAGR. And next year, the EPS growth should accelerate, with ~14% EPS growth expected in CY26. The expected growth ahead should actually continue to warrant a higher forward earnings multiple of 23-23.5x, which implies upside in the high teens for the S&P 500. Exhibit C: S&P 500 EPS per year vs CY25 and CY26 expectations. (FactSet) However, there are some concerns that still exist in the current market, which mean while investors will get quite a few opportunities to buy shares at current valuations, markets will not give the all-clear signal until the FOMC meeting in early December. Investors now have and will get opportunities to invest in AI and tech spaces over the next few weeks, and in my opinion, selective opportunities in the Mag 7, semiconductor and networking spaces. Among the Mag 7 stocks, Amazon ( AMZN ), Alphabet ( GOOG ) and Microsoft look very interesting. Among semiconductor stocks, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ), Broadcom as well as networking stocks like Astera Labs ( ALAB ), Credo ( CRDO ), Celestica ( CLS ) look appealing. Separately, I also believe the software space also looks very appealing, with the backlog beginning to show first signs of growth in at least 15-18 months. Risks & Other Factors To Note At the moment, I see the VIX spiked to 27, which could be one of the earliest signals of a capitulation in the markets. Exhibit D: VIX spiked to +27 this week after Nvidia’s earnings. (TradingView) But I believe markets are going to wait for at least three things before they proceed. First, the crypto markets need to show more signs of health and a return to normalcy. There are rumors of a big player facing mega liquidations. Second, markets need to believe that the equilibrium between BoJ’s interest rate regime and the US Fed will not be disturbed and the BoJ will find a way to maintain stable policy rate decisions despite fears of the Japanese yen falling further. BoJ’s next meeting falls on Dec 18-19 . But before that, and most importantly, all eyes will be on what the US Fed does and says. Therefore, thirdly, the US Fed’s actions, decisions, and projections on Dec 9-10 will be ultra crucial to mold the market’s perspectives of its path ahead. US Feds did calm the markets somewhat yesterday. For now, NYFed Chairman, part of the leadership troika at the US Fed, did calm markets after saying that “there is more room to lower rates without spiking inflation.” Markets did calm down on Friday after the volatile whipsaw post Nvidia’s ER. So no matter how bullish I am about the next year or how much I believe in AI, I do strongly suspect much of the next 2 weeks will be spent in picking on clues about interest rates, broader market stability and global liquidity and I strongly recommend investors focus on these macro factors first. Takeaway The past few weeks have been tough for investors, with diverging conversations increasingly showing up for and against AI, dividing investors over the growth prospects of AI. However, as explained above, I believe macro factors like liquidity and interest rate uncertainty are more to blame than fears about AI bubbles. I strongly urge investors to remain calm, stay rational, and be selective in the opportunities they pick to benefit from alpha in a market that is now giving more opportunities to investors due to the irrational fears about AI bubbles.",NVDA|MSFT|GOOG|AMZN|AMD|ALAB|CRDO|CLS|CLS:CA|MAGS|SP500|COMP:IND|QQQ|DJI|SPX|SPY,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|ZRX|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-22 14:55:52

The analyst believes that XRP’s future depends on measurable utility rather than market hype, positioning the cryptocurrency as an asset built for deep financial integration, which could fuel a prolonged upward rally. Why A $1,000 XRP Price Is Not A Dream Pseudonymous crypto analyst 24HRSCRYPTO predicted on X this Friday that XRP could climb from its current price of above $1.9 to $1,000. He described the path to this ambitious target as a matter of scaling rather than a dream. He also framed it as a math-based outcome, essentially driven by XRP’s foundational role as a global payments currency. Related Reading: Analyst Claims XRP Price Will Surge To $220 Due To ETFs, But Is This Possible? The analyst noted that XRP’s upside potential is more closely tied to real financial infrastructure than to short-lived speculation-driven appreciation. He emphasized that investors often overlook the role of utility, global settlement demands, and deep liquidity, which he believes are the backbone of XRP’s trajectory. These factors set XRP apart from other cryptocurrencies that mainly depend on traders buying at consistently rising prices. 24HRSCRYPTO uses a simple comparison to illustrate the difference that drives cryptocurrency prices. In his view, the Bitcoin price reaches new all-time highs primarily through speculation, while XRP grows through real financial activity supported by its innovative technology. According to the analyst, this disparity is why he believes patience and consistency matter more than hype cycles. The analyst also insists that XRP’s design positions it for long-term use in financial infrastructure where trillions of dollars flow, creating steady demand. He explained that even a modest investment of $5,000 held with discipline until 2030 can grow when supported by real value. This bullish scenario puts a $100 target for XRP within reach as global settlement usage increases. The same logic also supports the analyst’s bold $1,000 price projection. XRP Technical Analysis Signals Growing Strength The XRP price has been dragged down amid the broader market slump, recently crashing to new lows below $2. Despite the altcoin’s weak price action, analysts still hold out hope for a potential market shift to the upside. Related Reading: Analyst Claims XRP Will Flip Bitcoin As These Developments Play Out In a recent technical analysis, crypto market expert Rose Premium Signals notes that XRP has tapped the same demand zone for the third time, creating a strong triple bottom on the weekly timeframe. The analyst’s chart shows that each time the price returns to the $1.8 to $1.9 demand zone, it triggers strong buying. This repeated pattern confirms the formation of a triple bottom, which she considers a classic high-timeframe reversal signal. The chart also reveals that XRP’s recent downtrend has been controlled and met by a well-defended support level. Rose Premium Signals emphasized that each bounce from this support area has triggered progressively stronger reactions. If momentum is confirmed, she predicts that XRP could surge above $3 in the mid-term.

His breakdown of how assets typically behave when exchange-traded funds enter the market has prompted a range of reactions, as participants attempt to understand the current downturn and its implications on XRP. The discussion reflects an effort to determine whether the current XRP price volatility aligns with previous ETF-driven cycles or new conditions are shaping a different outcome. Here is the process 1. ETFs go live 2. Market Makers dump 3. ETFs soak up supply 4. The asset then pumps Just look at the BTC 13 day “dump” after its ETFs followed by 51 days of a 90% rally. — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) November 20, 2025 Rector’s Four-Step Sequence Rector pointed to a familiar structure that has played out in previous ETF launches. His outline begins with the ETFs going live, which historically introduces a new source of structured market participation. Following this, he noted that market makers often initiate selling pressure, creating a temporary downturn. According to his framework, ETFs then gradually absorb the available supply, ultimately setting the stage for the asset to move upward once the initial imbalance stabilizes. He referenced Bitcoin’s experience as the most recent example. After its ETFs launched, Bitcoin faced a 13-day decline before transitioning into a sustained period of growth. The subsequent 51-day rally produced a significant upward move of roughly 90%, illustrating how quickly momentum can shift once the market completes that early post-ETF adjustment period. Rector’s core point is that such patterns have precedents, and that short-term downturns following ETF approval do not necessarily indicate weakening fundamentals or a long-term reversal. Community Reactions and Diverging Views Not all observers agreed that the current environment would mirror previous cycles. An X user known as Ullr argued that the present situation differs because much of the crypto market remains closely tied to Bitcoin’s performance. His view suggests that the broader dependence on Bitcoin makes it less likely for assets to follow individual ETF-driven trajectories in the near term. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Matthew Giannini took a more moderate position, acknowledging that there may be truth to the outlined sequence but adding that the current downturn appears to extend beyond ETF dynamics. He described the situation as part of a larger global market issue, expressing hope that the recent decline represents a temporary setback rather than a coordinated reaction to ETF launches. Another user, PowMan, focused on the emotional impact of the widespread downturn, noting that the entire market is in decline and that XRP is following the trend without showing resistance. He clarified that the movement does not alter his long-term strategy but acknowledged the discouraging nature of the present conditions. The differing interpretations highlight a market still searching for clarity. Rector’s model provides a structured way to view the current price action, while responses from other participants underscore the complexity of today’s macro-environment. Whether the present decline aligns with previous ETF cycles or reflects broader pressures, the coming weeks will determine which perspective more accurately describes this phase of the market.

The article delves into which cryptocurrencies are poised for growth and why they could be key players in the upcoming market rebound. Ethena (ENA) Sees Potential Growth Despite Recent Price Drop Source: tradingview Ethena's price has been fluctuating between the low twenties and thirties in cents. Recently, it has seen a drop of over forty percent in the last month. Currently, it trades in the range of $0.23 to $0.34. Despite the dip, there's potential for growth as the nearest resistance level is $0.40, which suggests a possible increase of twenty percent. If momentum strengthens, it might reach $0.51, marking a possible rise of over fifty percent from the current low. With the RSI under 40, there's room for upward movement when buyers step in. Investors may find this an intriguing opportunity for gains if upward trends are realized. Algorand (ALGO) Eyes Potential Recovery Amidst Price Struggles Source: tradingview Algorand (ALGO) has recently been found trading within a low to mid-price range, hinting at potential recovery. Despite its shaky position and recent drop of around 25% in the last month, ALGO remains above its lowest support level of just less than ten cents. If it manages to breach its nearest resistance level, just over twenty cents, ALGO could experience approximately a 15% hike from its current position. This recovery could pick up pace towards a second hurdle, giving it around a 30% boost. However, patient investors should watch closely, as overcoming current price trends may require some time and positive market signals. Mantle (MNT) Struggles Yet Hints at Rebound, Eye on Resistance Levels Source: tradingview Mantle (MNT) is in a challenging phase, dropping about 19% this week and 40% over the past month but showing nearly 30% growth over six months. Currently fluctuating between a low of $1.11 and a high of $1.33, it faces a resistance hurdle at $1.46. If it manages to break this, Mantle could make a strong push towards the next resistance at $1.68, representing a potential rise of about 25%. The support level sits at $1.02, helping to keep it from falling too far. With the Relative Strength Index nearing a neutral zone, there might be room for an upward trend soon. Conclusion In conclusion, these three coins show strong potential to recover quickly from recent oversold conditions. Solana presents robust fundamentals and a committed community. Cardano continues to make significant progress with its technological developments and promising partnerships. Polkadot benefits from its unique approach to interoperability and scalability. These factors position them well for a rebound. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Gilbertie claims Ripple is ‘literally building a JP Morgan rival,’ a fully capitalized, highly disciplined institution engineered for global scale. At the heart of Ripple’s vision is XRP, which Gilbertie underscores as the core of the entire ecosystem. Unlike traditional institutions that sell assets to stay afloat, Ripple has no plans to offload its XRP holdings. Instead, it treats XRP as a long-term strategic reserve, an appreciating asset designed to anchor its financial infrastructure. This strategy elevates XRP beyond a simple cryptocurrency, positioning it as a foundational pillar of a next-generation global financial network. Gilbertie’s view of Ripple goes far beyond its balance sheet. He describes the company as “a machine,” a tightly integrated ecosystem where top talent circulates across projects while staying anchored to the XRPL. This structure, he argues, continuously compounds the network’s strength, driving innovation, scalability, and long-term resilience. By retaining expertise in-house while expanding its global reach, Ripple is positioning itself as a dynamic, future-proof hub capable of challenging entrenched financial giants. Therefore, the implications are massive. If Ripple secures its banking license, it gains the regulatory foundation to operate at full global scale, putting it in direct competition with the world’s most powerful financial institutions. But unlike traditional banks, Ripple is built on a blockchain-native backbone, with XRP functioning both as a liquid reserve asset and a real-time bridge for cross-border value transfer. This dual role positions Ripple to redefine global money movement with speed, efficiency, and transparency that legacy systems simply cannot match. Gilbertie’s remarks highlight a major shift in crypto: the move from speculation to real financial infrastructure. Ripple’s strategic stewardship of $XRP signals a long-term plan where digital assets function not as trading chips but as foundational components of a global payments engine. By retaining control of its token and cultivating a tightly integrated ecosystem of talent, liquidity, and innovation, Ripple is building a self-reinforcing network designed to scale, strengthen, and influence the broader financial landscape. Gilbertie’s claim that “Ripple is at the center of the universe” underscores the scale of its ambition. Ripple isn’t just evolving with the future of finance, it’s trying to shape it. By leveraging XRP, regulatory readiness, and a disciplined, unified team, the company is positioning itself to challenge the dominance of traditional banking giants. If Ripple executes on this vision, it could transform a blockchain network into a fully integrated global bank, redefining what digital finance means for the decade ahead. Conclusion Gilbertie casts Ripple not as a fringe player, but as a disciplined, strategically aligned force with the potential to reshape global finance. Should it secure a banking license and continue anchoring its ecosystem around $XRP, Ripple could become one of the first truly blockchain-native financial institutions capable of challenging legacy banking giants. Rivaling JP Morgan is still a question of scale, but the direction is clear: Ripple is building the infrastructure, talent, and capital base for long-term dominance. If Gilbertie’s assessment proves true, the world may soon see a financial landscape where Ripple, and $XRP, sit at the center of a new digital monetary era.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-22 15:21:59

The correction, now over 45%, has brought the price into key technical areas that analysts say could support a market rebound. Several traders have adjusted their market outlooks, now expecting a longer cycle and higher upside targets. Daily volume sits at $50.3 billion. Ethereum is down 10% in the past 24 hours and nearly 15% over the past week. This move has brought ETH into areas where previous buyer interest was strong. Structure Shifts to Wave 2 StockTrader_Max posted an updated Elliott Wave count showing that ETH has broken into its previous Wave 1 range. This rules out a Wave 4 correction and suggests a Wave 2 retracement is now underway. These types of pullbacks usually happen earlier in a cycle. “ETH is already at the 0.618 FIB… this is an area where I expect to see a low form,” the analyst noted. Notably, the 0.618 retracement level sits around $2,748. It often acts as support in trending markets. Based on this count, the next move — Wave 3 — could target $8,800. That replaces a prior estimate of $6,000 for the end of Wave 5. Source: StockTrader_Max/X Price Nears Major Support Zone Bleeding Crypto shared a chart showing ETH inside a wide Fibonacci support zone. This area includes the 0.618 level at $2,748, the 0.706 level at $2,433, and the 0.786 level at $2,147. These zones line up with a price range where ETH traded sideways earlier this year. The drop has brought ETH back into this prior consolidation range. That kind of structure has provided support in the past. The correction is deep but within the range of past cycles. If the asset stays in this area, it could form a base for future moves. In addition, Ash Crypto posted that Ethereum has now filled a CME gap on the daily chart. It was left open for about four months, and it was between $2,850 and $3,000. “Most CME gaps are filled before a big move,” the post said. Meanwhile, some traders see this as a technical step often completed before a shift in trend. The price is now in a key area, and watching volume and structure will be important in the next sessions. $2,800 Flips From Support to Resistance Ted pointed out that ETH has dropped below $2,800 and touched $2,650. “If ETH doesn’t reclaim the $2,800 level soon, expect a drop towards the $2,500 level,” he wrote. This zone is also where realized prices of several wallet groups converge . That adds weight to it as a key level. If the market holds this range, it may offer a short-term bottom. If not, lower targets will stay in view.

This setback has cast doubts on the network’s reliability. The upcoming analysis will delve into whether its developers can regain users’ trust and examine which cryptocurrencies show promise for an upward trend amidst this uncertainty. Cardano (ADA) Eyes Potential Rebound Amid Recent Slump Source: tradingview Cardano hovers between forty-four and fifty-seven cents, nearing key resistance at sixty-five cents. Despite a dip of over 36% this month, ADA exhibits resilience. Its RSI, under 40, signals it's oversold, hinting at possible upward momentum. If it breaks past sixty-five cents, it could aim for seventy-eight cents, marking a rise of about 36% from current levels. Traders watch closely, hoping for a bounce that might signal recovery. However, ADA needs to maintain above its support at thirty-nine cents to ward off further declines. As it stands, Cardano’s future could see a rebound, but stability is key for sustained growth. Conclusion The pressure is on for Cardano's developers to regain trust after a recent setback. Eyes are on how quickly issues can be fixed and if the improvements will boost Cardano's standing. This challenge could influence other coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, and Binance Coin. Their paths may offer lessons or warnings for Cardano's future. Success in overcoming this hurdle could lead to renewed interest and support. Failure to address problems promptly might result in a loss of confidence. The outcome will shape opinions and investment choices moving forward. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Bitcoin took the brunt of the move, plunging as traders reassessed liquidity conditions and repriced recession risks. With volatility surging and key technical levels under pressure, investors are now asking the same question: what comes next for BTC? This analysis is powered by Outset PR , a crypto-native PR agency built on data, trends, and market timing. It helps Web3 leaders make the most of every moment. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Key Support at $83,500 Holds as Market Searches for Direction Source: tradingview Bitcoin is trading in a wide consolidation band between $88,000 and slightly above $103,000, struggling to regain momentum after a sharp multi-week decline. The asset has fallen more than 15% over the past week and over 22% across both the monthly and six-month timeframe, reflecting deepening risk aversion and continued deleveraging across crypto markets. Despite the drawdown, BTC is approaching a major support zone near $83,500, a level that previously served as a strong base during periods of heightened volatility. Analysts say this area will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin can stabilize and attempt a rebound, or if further downside pressure could push the market toward new local lows. A successful defense of the $83,500 level could set up a recovery toward the next significant resistance at $112,700 — representing a potential upside of roughly 27% from current prices. Such a move would require renewed buyer interest, improved liquidity conditions, and a slowdown in the recent sell-program activity triggered by macro uncertainty. For now, the market remains fragile, and price action is likely to stay choppy. Traders are watching whether Bitcoin can maintain footing above key support levels in the coming sessions. If it does, the groundwork for a moderate relief rally may begin to take shape; if not, the path ahead could bring deeper volatility.

54753658,632647,1763825458,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54753658.jpeg,Ex-Coinbase Lawyer Reveals Agenda In Bid For New York AG Office – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/ex-coinbase-lawyer-reveals-agenda-in-bid-for-ny-ag/,"Khurram Dara, a former policy counsel at cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, officially announced his intention to run for the office of New York State Attorney General. Former Coinbase Attorney Accuses New York AG Of Partisanship On Friday, November 21, Dara announced his candidacy on the social media platform X and revealed his agenda for the office of New York State Attorney General. According to his campaign message, the former Coinbase counsel intends to put an end to the “lawfare” by the current New York AG, Letitia James, on businesses and innovations. Dara accused James of partisanship and putting her political ambitions first in the disposition of her duties as Attorney General. With his regulatory and policy experience in the crypto and fintech space—most notably at Coinbase and Bain Capital Crypto, Dara claims to have seen firsthand these companies being unfairly targeted by the government. A part of the former Coinbase attorney’s campaign message read: Dara’s platform includes ending lawfare, prioritizing public safety and making New York more business- and innovation-friendly. Dara says he plans to make specific changes to the office to address affordability and the cost of doing business, such as curbing the office’s use of the Martin Act, ending the practice of hiring private law firms on a contingency-fee basis, and fighting unlawful regulations. The ex-Coinbase lawyer said that he intends to run under the Republican Party, speaking about tackling New Yorkers’ concerns about the cost of living and affordability. Over the years, James has gained popularity for her enforcement of strict regulations on the cryptocurrency space. Since taking office in 2019, the Attorney General has filed lawsuits against several crypto companies, including Gemini, Genesis, KuCoin, and Nexo, while agreeing to significant settlement deals with some of these firms. A New Dawn For Crypto In New York? Interestingly, the New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani seems to lean more towards James’s approach to consumer protection-focused crypto regulation. Such an instance was seen in 2023 when Mamdani, who was then a member of the New York City Assembly, agreed to AG James’s bill to protect vulnerable New York investors. It is worth noting, though, that the New York Mayor-elect has never taken a clear public stance on cryptocurrencies , with his past comments suggesting improved regulation rather than unchecked scrutiny. All in all, the city administration’s influence over the state and federal crypto infrastructure is limited. As of this writing, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization stands at around $2.87 trillion. With most large-cap assets under significant bearish pressure, the crypto market saw its value shrink by nearly 10% in the past week.

The sudden shift in investor sentiment has caused a ripple effect across various cryptocurrencies. This article explores the reasons behind the downturn and highlights coins that might offer growth potential in these turbulent times. Discover which altcoins are poised to recover despite the current market challenges. In a rapidly evolving landscape where focus and narratives constantly shift, timely interventions and sustained visibility are paramount. This is why data-driven agencies like Outset PR go beyond merely tracking token prices; they also monitor the wider media environment. Outset Data Pulse delivers current intelligence on crypto media performance, significantly enhancing the effectiveness of PR campaigns. Solana's Rollercoaster: Will the Tide Turn? Source: tradingview Solana (SOL) is on a downward trend, currently priced between around $124 and $161. The cryptocurrency's recent drop, with a one-month decrease of over 31%, raises questions about its future. Despite this, its potential for growth remains. If Solana breaks the nearest resistance at $185, it could climb higher, with the next target at $222, which signifies a potential rise of about 36% from its low end. However, if the price tumbles again, support at nearly $110 can provide a cushion. Current indicators suggest bearish momentum, but market shifts may change this scenario. Keep an eye on those resistance and support levels to better understand where Solana is heading next. How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Conclusion SOL has faced a significant drop, reflecting a broader trend impacting the whole altcoin market. Other major coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum are also experiencing similar declines. Risk-off sentiment is influencing investor decisions, pushing down prices across the board. As market uncertainty continues, traders remain cautious. This downturn signals a challenging period ahead for altcoins, with SOL's dip being a clear indicator. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Here’s What Analysts Say",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/has-the-bitcoin-decline-ended-or-is-there-more-to-come-heres-what-analysts-say/,"Cryptocurrency analyst Steven Ehrlich commented on Bitcoin following the sharp sell-off in the market. According to Ehrlich, although Bitcoin briefly reclaimed the $85,000 level in the morning hours following New York Fed President John Williams' “dovish” statements about the possibility of a new interest rate cut next month, this rise is not expected to be permanent. Ehrlich noted that technical indicators indicate the downtrend is not yet complete, saying, “Tactical signals suggest the market still has a long way to go.” The analyst argued that, unlike previous sharp declines, this time Bitcoin is not just setting its own direction, but the direction of the entire crypto market. Related News: Renowned Author Robert Kiyosaki Reveals He Sold His Bitcoin - What Will He Do Next? Ehrlich noted that Bitcoin broke through the lower bound of its multi-year upward channel, which began in 2023 and strengthened by the acceleration during the Trump era. He noted that this level has served as support many times in the past, but failed to hold this time. According to the analyst, the market is currently searching for new support.

Projects rise and fall on sentiment, momentum, and community trust. Data-driven PR brings stability to this landscape: instead of relying on intuition, you shape stories, timing, and positioning using measurable signals from the market, media, and community. Data-driven PR is only as strong as the systems behind it. Outset PR built its model around measurable impact—not guesswork, not generic outreach, and not “spray-and-pray” distribution. The result is a PR approach that consistently delivers more reach, better placement quality, and stronger business outcomes for crypto companies. Mapping Publications Through Quantifiable Performance Data Outset PR’s strategy begins with systematic evaluation of crypto and finance outlets. Their internal tool, Syndication Map , tracks metrics such as: consistent domain activity month-to-month visibility changes audience geography traffic origin (direct, social, search, aggregator-driven) historical syndication patterns likelihood of downstream republication This allows the team to categorize publications based on actual performance rather than reputation or assumptions. Instead of distributing press releases broadly, campaigns focus on outlets with the strongest potential to generate sustained reach—not simply first-layer impressions. Selecting Outlets Based on Measurable Syndication Potential The majority of impressions in crypto PR do not come from the initial placement. They come from secondary republications across aggregators and news platforms. Outset PR evaluates outlets according to their syndication behavior with the use of its proprietary Syndication Map. The resulting patterns help forecast how widely a story may spread before a campaign is even launched. A targeted tier-1 placement, selected for high syndication probability, can drive exponential lift.The StealthEX case demonstrated this clearly: a focused pitching strategy resulted in 92 republications and an estimated 3+ billion impressions across global platforms. Aligning PR Angles With Data From Market Trends Strong impressions depend on relevance and proper timing . Outset PR uses trend monitoring—search patterns, social volume, narrative cycles—to determine which angles are more likely to be picked up within a given week or month. For example, if data indicates increased interest in AI-driven DeFi or RWA tokens, campaigns are structured to intersect with these themes. This doesn't mean adjusting the truth of a story; it means articulating the narrative in a way that meets demonstrated demand from editors and audiences. The advantage is straightforward: announcements enter the media cycle at the point where the topic has measurable momentum. Using Analytical Insights to Shape Future Campaigns Outset PR’s in-house intelligence system Outset Data Pulse continuously updates outlet performance data. This includes: shifts in domain authority seasonal variations in traffic changes in syndication networks geographic redistribution of reader interest growth or decline among algorithmic aggregators For clients, this translates into forward-looking guidance: which outlets are gaining ground, which are declining, where regional interest is shifting, and how a story is likely to behave once released. This predictive view reduces uncertainty in campaign planning and gives teams a realistic sense of expected outcomes. Maintaining Editorial Access Through Consistent Professional Standards Media relations matter most when paired with relevant, well-prepared material. Outset PR’s team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , maintains strong editorial access by prioritizing accurate, grounded pitches and consistent communication. The relationship is functional: editors respond to teams who deliver useful information, follow formatting norms, and avoid overclaiming. This reliability increases the likelihood of timely review—an important factor in crypto journalism, where news cycles are short and editors handle large volumes of inbound mail. Why Outset PR Can Produce High Impressions Large outreach numbers are not produced by chance. They are a result of: selecting publications based on performance data creating narratives aligned with current media demand forecasting syndication pathways maintaining reliable editorial communication adjusting campaigns according to measurable results This combination addresses long-standing inefficiencies in Web3 PR: generic messaging, poor alignment with media needs, and campaigns that focus on quantity instead of demonstrable reach. Data-driven PR offers a clearer path: a structured process that connects where a story is published to how far it travels and which audiences it reaches. FAQ Section Why is data-driven PR important in the crypto industry? Crypto media cycles move quickly and are heavily influenced by narrative trends. A data-driven approach allows PR teams to time announcements accurately, select publications based on measurable performance, and forecast the syndication potential of each placement. This results in more predictable and higher-impact campaigns. What is Outset PR’s Syndication Map? Syndication Map is Outset PR’s internal tool that analyzes the behavior of crypto and finance publications. It evaluates their traffic sources, domain activity, audience geography, and historical republication patterns to identify outlets with the highest likelihood of generating extended reach beyond the initial publication. How does syndication contribute to total impressions? Most impressions in crypto PR come from republications on aggregators and algorithm-driven feeds, not from the original article. Platforms like CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance frequently pick up stories from selected outlets. With proper outlet targeting, this secondary distribution can multiply outreach several times. Are media relationships still relevant in a data-focused PR model? Yes. Editorial relationships ensure that data-backed pitches are reviewed promptly and handled by the right editors. Reliable communication and accurate narratives increase the likelihood of being considered for coverage, which then enables syndication. How does Outset PR decide which outlets to pitch? Outlet selection is based on domain performance, audience match, syndication history, and shifts in visibility patterns. Outset PR uses its proprietary Outset Data Pulse intelligence to pick the outlets that work best. The goal is to prioritize publications that are statistically more likely to produce sustained reach. Can smaller crypto projects benefit from this approach? Yes. Data-driven PR is not limited to large brands. Smaller projects can benefit from precise targeting, better narrative alignment, and insights into which outlets provide the highest value for limited budgets.

Imagine waking up to discover your modest investment in PEPE memecoin has multiplied beyond your wildest dreams. The green frog mascot that started as an internet joke now represents one of the most talked-about cryptocurrency investments. Our comprehensive PEPE price prediction analysis examines whether this viral sensation can realistically reach the elusive 1 cent milestone by 2030. Understanding PEPE Memecoin’s Current Market Position The Pepe memecoin emerged during the 2023 memecoin frenzy, capturing attention with its nostalgic internet culture roots. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies with complex technological foundations, PEPE’s value derives primarily from community sentiment and social media momentum. This cryptocurrency analysis begins by examining PEPE’s tokenomics and circulating supply, which currently stands in the quadrillions, creating significant challenges for price appreciation. PEPE Price Prediction 2025: Short-Term Outlook Our technical analysis suggests PEPE faces several critical resistance levels in the coming year. Key factors influencing our 2025 PEPE price prediction include: Market capitalization requirements for price milestones Community engagement and social media trends Broader cryptocurrency market conditions Regulatory developments affecting memecoins Year Conservative Prediction Optimistic Prediction Key Factors 2025 $0.000008 $0.000015 Market recovery, community growth 2026 $0.000012 $0.000025 Mainstream adoption, exchange listings 2030 $0.00008 $0.0002 Long-term ecosystem development The Mathematics Behind Reaching 1 Cent Can Pepe memecoin realistically achieve the 1 cent target?

MUTM’s performance in its early stages, with its steadily increasing community and utilization-based model, now has more upside than some heavyweight performers such as Solana (SOL) in the short term itself. Although Solana is now firmly establishing itself in the elite ranks of blockchain platforms, its short-term growth momentum looks to be more controlled than MUTM’s rapidly increasing demand. MUTM, now in its sixth stage of presale, with over 95% sold out, is now being noticed for its real-world applications in its DeFi crypto with its lending-borrowing functionalities, interest-based token model, and its unusually rapidly increasing community, which in itself now places MUTM among those few new tokens with upside to outperform major altcoin in its next market cycle. This makes MUTM the top crypto for investors seeking real utility and growth potential in 2025. Solana Shows Signs of Recovery After Sharply Dropping? Since November 11, Solana (SOL) has indicated an encouraging V-shaped recovery on its four-hour chart after slipping by 25% from its peak at $173. Bears pulled out, and buyers regained their ground, pushing prices higher, with its Relative Strength Index rising from 28 to 50, indicating increasing bullishness for the index. On analysis based on its weekly graph, there is some impressive support for SOL at $130, which has in the past sparked some remarkable rises, such as an 108% jump to $265 in late 2024 and a 98% jump to $250 in early 2025. But if patterns repeat, there could be some increase in SOL’s recovery to about the $180-$200 level, especially with support from its 20-day EMA at $160. It’s in such a scenario, with some level of recovery, volatility, and growth, that market players have begun to analyze Mutuum Finance, one of the leading DeFi cryptos gaining traction. MUTM Presale: Tapping into Investor Interest Mutuum Finance (MUTM) remains in the headlines for being the top crypto in 2025. Mutuum Finance has successfully engaged over 18,120 individual participants, with more than $18.85 million received to date, marking market confidence in the project. At present, Phase 6 tokens cost $0.035. But given the upcoming Phase 7, there’s an increase in cost by 20% to $0.04, thereby affording subscribers a short-term opportunity to acquire early-access MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance differs from other typical altcoins in highlighting genuine adoption, thereby identifying it as one such DeFi crypto with tremendous growth potential, especially in the lead-up to Phase 7. Convenient Access: Purchase MUTM Using Credit Cards and Debit Cards To facilitate new participants, Mutuum Finance introduces support for buying MUTM via Credit and Debit Cards . MUTM is now among the easiest DeFi cryptos to invest in, with fewer obstacles to entry for new participants. By achieving wider usability, MUTM remains the top crypto to monitor in 2025. Preparing for a Full-Featured Lending and Borrowing Platform Mutuum Finance’s team is moving forward in full steam with its project to launch its overall lending and borrowing platform. Its platform will utilize smart contracts to enable secure loans and borrowing, with an interface scalable for mass adoption. One crucial point in this stage would be the launch of the test network for the Sepolia project, which will enable its users to test its lending, borrowing, and repayment features in a controlled environment. Its primary aim would be to test its functionality and security. Early MUTM Investors Might Outperform SOL Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already partnered with over 18,120 investors, having raised over $18.85 million, with Phase 6 sold out over 95% at just $0.035 per token, while Phase 7 is set to drive prices to $0.04. It’s not too early to invest in Mutuum given its rapidly growing network, its real-world applications in DeFi, and its upcoming testnet launch for its version 1 protocol, with MUTM’s growth potential likely to outperform some major altcoins such as Solana (SOL). Join MUTM now to be part of the top crypto projects in 2025.

São Paulo remains the largest cryptocurrency hub in Brazil, accounting for 31.3% of the country’s rich and diverse investor base. These stories demonstrate the changing landscape of bitcoin acceptance, legislation, and market activity in Latin America. El Salvador’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy under scrutiny The Salvadoran government has received renewed worldwide attention after purchasing 1,089 BTC after a dramatic market collapse on Wednesday, in which Bitcoin briefly dipped below $90,000. This acquisition increases the country’s overall holdings to over 7,474 BTC, reinforcing its accumulation strategy despite market volatility and a nearly 27% decline from Bitcoin’s all-time high. Officials stressed that the acquisition, which was made in three big transactions totalling more than $100 million, demonstrates sustained trust in Bitcoin as a long-term strategic asset. The action came amid increased uncertainty and macroeconomic pressure, sparking debate about its economic implications. Despite the fact that Bitcoin is no longer legal tender in the country as a result of IMF accords, the administration continues to accumulate the asset, touting it as a cornerstone of its financial strategy. While some analysts see the endurance of these purchases as evidence of institutional conviction, others believe that the market’s fragility raises concerns about long-term risk and sustainability. Argentina’s LIBRA crypto investigation reaches critical stage The Argentine Congress’s LIBRA Investigative Commission issued its long-awaited final report , coinciding with the unexpected transfer of millions of dollars from inactive wallets associated with the case. The report, which was created after months of testimony, technical research, and judicial cooperation, seeks to analyse political accountability, judicial oversight, and fund management in one of Argentina’s most contentious cryptocurrency investigations. Commission President Maxi Ferraro stated that the report investigates any indirect payments to public officials and assesses acts or omissions that may have enabled or failed to prevent the developments in the LIBRA affair. Meanwhile, on-chain experts discovered considerable wallet activity, with previously inactive wallets transferring more than $58 million in USDC to SOL, a currency that cannot be frozen, raising concerns about timing and intent. United States officials momentarily froze and then released the money, while Argentine prosecutors continue to seek freeze orders. The report’s release represents a watershed moment for judicial oversight, political accountability, and intensified scrutiny of LIBRA-linked wallets, as analysts warn that these recent transactions could be the last visible evidence of significant cash. São Paulo leads Brazil’s crypto market, says poll According to a 2025 Altside survey, São Paulo now accounts for 31.3% of all cryptocurrency investors in Brazil , exceeding the combined proportion of the North and Northeast regions (16.3%). According to the report, Brazilian crypto investors are becoming more mature and rich, with an average wealth of BRL 521,900, more than three times that of traditional investors, and more than a quarter owning assets worth more than BRL 1 million. This generational shift indicates that cryptocurrencies are no longer simply for enthusiasts but are being used in asset management and diversification plans. The report also reveals evolving investor behaviour: an average of six cryptoassets per portfolio, 54.2% in self-custody, and a virtually even distribution of risk profiles. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Tether/USDT, and XRP are popular assets, with 19% staking and 17.5% investing in yield-generating stablecoins, indicating an increasing sophistication. These trends reflect worldwide developments, such as Bitcoin ETFs and institutional engagement from corporations such as BlackRock and Fidelity, which coincide with new BTC highs in 2025.

The analyst emphasized that the current low price allows exchange-traded products to acquire significantly larger quantities of XRP, suggesting an intensified acceleration of a possible future supply shock. This perspective has attracted direct responses from X users who offered contrasting explanations, creating a broader conversation on how off-exchange activity may be influencing visible market data. ETF Buying and the Supply Shock Expectation According to the analyst, the reduced market price enables institutional products to secure substantially higher volumes than they could at elevated price levels. The analyst added that this dynamic is contributing to a rapid increase in locked-in supply, reinforcing the view that a supply shock may be developing faster than previously anticipated. This position aligns with ongoing expectations that institutional involvement will eventually alter the structure of XRP’s liquidity as more units become absorbed through long-term holdings . The current low price means ETFs are buying twice as much XRP. This is accelerating the supply shock dramatically. — {x} (@unknowDLT) November 20, 2025 Counterarguments About Price Behavior An X user, Jack Lee, challenged the analyst’s conclusion by pointing out that the price has continued to decline despite the alleged increased accumulation. He questioned the logic of the claim, given that market prices have not yet reflected upward pressure. His remark underscored the uncertainty shared by investors who look to exchange-based metrics as primary indicators of demand. Explanation of Off-Exchange Accumulation Another participant, OrangePineGood, responded to Jack Lee with an explanation centered on off-exchange buying mechanisms. He stated that a substantial portion of institutional acquisition occurs through over-the-counter arrangements and other non-exchange channels. According to his view, these transactions are not visible in central exchange pricing, which is why the spot market does not reflect the scale of ongoing accumulation. He added that what becomes measurable later is the effect once larger capital flows transition onto exchanges, where the reduced available supply forces price adjustments. He also noted that wallet movements occasionally provide indirect signs of these off-exchange activities.

She stated that even if XRP remained at $2 for an extended period, supporters would view the situation positively because prolonged lower prices would allow further accumulation before a potential upward adjustment. Her comment highlighted the segment of holders who consider temporary stagnation an advantage rather than a drawback. The discussion following the analyst’s statement illustrates the range of interpretations regarding how institutional buying interacts with visible market data. While some investors question the absence of direct price movement, others maintain that off-exchange accumulation and delayed price impact explain the current market behavior. As institutional participation continues to grow, these differing viewpoints reflect the ongoing attempt to understand how supply conditions may evolve in the periods ahead.

The extreme volatility occurred despite a substantial decline in overall trading activity across the Dogecoin ecosystem. The liquidation event resulted in total losses of $462,340 within one hour. Long position traders bore the brunt of the losses, with $287,990 in liquidations compared to $174,350 for short positions. This disparity reveals that bullish traders suffered disproportionately during the volatile period. Trading Volume Plummets as Price Declines Market data shows Dogecoin's trading volume dropped 41.14% to $2.36 billion during the period. The sharp decline in trading activity directly impacted the token's price performance. Dogecoin's value fell to $0.1369, representing a 1.46% decrease within the timeframe. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1382, suggesting a 0.96% increase in the last 24 hours.

Market participants appeared optimistic about a potential recovery but were caught off guard by sudden market shifts.

ETF Announcement Sparks Community Interest Market excitement had intensified following 21Shares' announcement of a 2x Long Dogecoin exchange-traded fund.

Investors viewed the ETF launch as a potential catalyst for increased institutional adoption and additional Dogecoin-based investment products.

Zcash (ZEC), one of the privacy tokens daring to defy the fearful market sentiment, has experienced a steady, choppy price action as market forces struggle to establish control. Interestingly, a prominent market analyst with the X username PlanD has discovered significant bearish potential on the horizon. Related Reading: Why is Zcash Surging? Analysts Break Down the ZEC Rally and What Comes Next Zcash To Fall To $281 – Is The Party Over? Despite its performance amid the general crypto market correction, Zcash struggles to break past a formidable barrier in the $750 price zone. In the last week, the privacy coin experienced this rejection in the two instances it climbed above the $700 price mark. According to PlanD, ZEC’s multiple rejections are also threatening the viability of an ascending channel that began in October. Notably, Zcash has broken below the lower boundary of this channel at $672, in successive moments, signaling increasing bearish pressure and weakening upward structure. If the market bears assume a dominant hand of the privacy coin, PlanD is projecting a price crash to around $281, indicating a potential 50% price loss from the present market prices. PlanD’s prediction is similar to that by fellow analyst Ali Martinez, who has since tipped ZEC could correct to around $325, following its struggles at the $750 price zone. However, while technical indicators point to an impending price collapse, strong fundamental developments provide bullishness for a continuous price uptrend. These include institutional endorsements as Cypherpunk Technologies, backed by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, which has recently launched a $50 million Zcash treasury strategy. Furthermore, the upcoming Zcash halving event, slated for November 28, adds another layer of bullish undertone as an increase in token scarcity is expected to drive demand pressure and subsequently boost prices.

Meanwhile, daily trading volume is down by 6.1% and valued at $2.24 billion. Nevertheless, ZEC’s monthly performance stands at a staggering 99.41% representing the coin’s defying bullish performance during a time when the total crypto market cap has reduced by 28%. In the last year alone, the privacy coin has surged by 928%, highlighting a remarkable and sustained bullish trajectory. With a market cap of $7.8 billion, ZEC now ranks as the 13th largest cryptocurrency in the world.

The plan aims to cut new supply at a much quicker pace, bringing Solana’s terminal inflation rate of 1.5% far sooner than the original timeline. The shift gives the network a leaner supply curve and reshapes how future emissions reach the market. Moreover, the proposal arrives during a tense price phase as Solana trades near a key technical zone and large holders reposition funds. Supply Curve That Tightens Faster The new SIMD-0411 proposal intends to double the disinflation rate without adjusting validator rewards. Hence, the network would remove roughly 22 million future tokens from expected emissions. Analysts note that this change eliminates billions in possible sell pressure over the next several years. Additionally, this move places Solana among the most aggressive chains in terms of supply discipline. Market watchers say the proposal strengthens Solana’s long-term scarcity narrative. The network already processes high transaction volumes and continues to attract developers. Hence, faster disinflation adds a new economic layer that reinforces its growth path and institutional interest. Solana trades at $126.83 after a modest daily increase. However, it remains down more than 10% this week. The circulating supply stands near 560 million tokens, giving the asset a market value of about $70.8 billion. Daily Chart Compression and Oversold Readings Satoshi Flipper reported that Solana’s daily chart shows a classic falling wedge pattern. The structure tightens at the apex while sellers lose strength. Price now presses into the $123–$127 support area as the RSI sinks deeply into oversold conditions. Source: X A breakout above $135 opens room toward $150. However, a close under $120 signals a deeper slide toward $110. Consequently, traders watch the wedge’s lower boundary closely for signs of a momentum shift. Large Transfers Surface as Forward Industries Moves Tokens Lookonchain reported that Forward Industries transferred 1.727 million SOL to an external wallet. The firm previously accumulated more than 6.8 million SOL at an average of $232, leaving it with a large unrealized loss.

As the landscape shifts, tools like GeeFi stand out as secure solutions for managing XRP investments and safeguarding assets against uncertainty. The company recently secured a massive $500 million funding round, pushing its valuation to an impressive $40 billion. Despite this massive injection of institutional capital, the price of XRP remains stubbornly flat, hovering around the $2.20 mark. This disconnect between corporate success and token performance has left many investors scratching their heads, wondering when the market will catch up to the headlines. The Hidden Risk of Waiting for the Breakout While investors wait for XRP to potentially capture trillions in volume, the immediate danger isn’t just market stagnation, it’s asset security. Holding your XRP on centralized exchanges while waiting for a price pump exposes you to unnecessary counterparty risks, including hacks, insolvencies, and frozen withdrawals. The golden rule of crypto remains: not your keys, not your coins . GeeFi addresses this critical vulnerability directly. It is a non-custodial crypto wallet designed to give you absolute sovereignty over your digital wealth. By ensuring you control your private keys, GeeFi eliminates the risks associated with third-party custodians. This security is essential for investors positioning themselves for the long haul, allowing them to hold their assets safely regardless of market volatility or exchange stability. A Fortress for Your Digital Assets The GeeFi wallet is engineered to be a sophisticated command center for the modern investor. Since development began in 2023, the GeeFi Team has prioritized building a wallet with robust defenses. This includes multi-factor security that combines biometric authentication with a unique passphrase, creating a formidable barrier against unauthorized access. GeeFi also tackles the anxiety of crypto transactions. It features human-readable addresses and transaction notes, minimizing the risk of sending funds to the wrong destination. Furthermore, the wallet’s built-in risk flags and scam link detection system actively monitor for threats, shielding you from the increasing number of phishing attacks and fraud attempts in the crypto space. The Ultimate Hub for Your Portfolio Managing a diverse portfolio can be chaotic, but GeeFi simplifies it with a single, unified dashboard. It offers native support for XRP, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, BNB, Dogecoin, Cardano, TRON, Sui, Avalanche, Shiba Inu, and many other networks. This cross-chain portfolio view allows you to track and manage all your investments in one place, without switching between multiple apps. The wallet is also packed with intelligent tools to optimize your trading. A gas and fee optimizer ensures you never overpay for transactions, while a pre-trade price impact preview protects you from slippage on swaps. With configurable auto-backups and social recovery options , you never have to worry about losing access to your funds. The app is live on Android, with an iOS version in development. An Unmissable Early-Stage Opportunity At the core of this ecosystem is the GeeFi Token (GEE) , which unlocks premium features like fee discounts and staking rewards. The presale has already generated massive interest, raising over $250,000 in its first 24 hours by selling more than 5.3 million tokens . This rapid uptake signals strong investor confidence in the project’s vision and utility. The presale is live now at just $0.05 per token . Early entry into high-utility projects is often where the most significant gains are made in crypto. This is a rare chance to get in on the ground floor of a platform poised to redefine self-custody. Prepare for the Future of Finance While the market debates XRP’s current price versus its trillion-dollar potential, smart investors are securing their positions. Whether Ripple captures 14% of SWIFT or not, the need for secure, self-custody solutions is undeniable. GeeFi provides the security you need today and an investment opportunity for tomorrow.

On the charts, the token is struggling to hold the critical $21 support level , battling bearish sentiment that has driven prices down significantly over the past few weeks. Yet, headlines tell a drastically different story. Reports indicate Avalanche plans to raise a massive $1 billion to bolster its corporate treasuries, a move that could eventually inject massive liquidity and confidence into the ecosystem. This disconnect between current price action and future ambition leaves investors at a crossroads. While institutions position themselves for the long game, retail traders must navigate the immediate chop. In such unpredictable times, where you store your assets matters as much as what you buy. The GeeFi wallet offers a secure, non-custodial solution, ensuring that while Avalanche builds its treasury, you maintain absolute sovereignty over your own. The Necessity of Self-Custody Market dips often expose the fragility of centralized exchanges. When panic sets in, withdrawal pauses and liquidity crunches become real threats. GeeFi eliminates this counterparty risk entirely. As a non-custodial platform, it guarantees that you are the only person with access to your private keys. This means your wealth remains untouchable by third-party failures, giving you the staying power to ride out the market’s volatility alongside the institutional giants. Engineered for Maximum Security The GeeFi Team began development in 2023 with a singular focus: building a fortress for digital assets. The wallet employs a robust multi-factor security system, combining biometric data with a unique passphrase. Beyond locking down access, GeeFi actively defends you from external threats. Built-in risk flags and scam link detection monitor transactions in real-time, protecting you from the phishing attempts that frequently target crypto investors during high-news cycles. Simplifying Portfolio Management Managing a portfolio across different blockchains can be chaotic, but GeeFi brings clarity to the experience. It features a unified, cross-chain portfolio view supporting Avalanche, Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, XRP, Dogecoin, Cardano, Solana, Tron, Sui, and Shiba Inu. You can track your entire net worth from one dashboard. Additionally, human-readable addresses and clear transaction notes ensure you never have to worry about copying and pasting complex strings of characters incorrectly. Tools for the Active Trader For those actively trading the AVAX volatility, GeeFi provides essential utilities to protect your bottom line. A gas and fee optimizer keeps network costs low, while a pre-trade price impact preview prevents slippage from eating into your profits. If you worry about losing your device, configurable auto-backups and social recovery options provide a decentralized safety net. The platform is also evolving rapidly. The roadmap includes an integrated DEX for instant swaps, fiat on/off-ramps for easy liquidity access, and native staking. Perhaps most exciting is the upcoming crypto card , which will allow you to spend your digital assets in the real world, bridging the gap between decentralized finance and daily life. A Rare Ground-Floor Opportunity The engine behind this ecosystem is the GeeFi Token (GEE) . The presale has just launched, and the market’s appetite is voracious. In just the first 24 hours, the project raised over $250,000 , selling more than 5.3 million tokens . This rapid accumulation suggests that investors see immense value in a utility-driven infrastructure project launching during a pivotal market moment. The presale is live right now at $0.05 per token . Opportunities to enter a high-growth project at this valuation are rare.

54755002,https://timestabloid.com/?p=90383,1763830977,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Liquidation Map Going Wild,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-liquidation-map-going-wild/,"The latest market data shared by crypto analyst and investor Xaif presents a notable shift in XRP’s derivatives landscape. Within 24 hours, the asset recorded approximately 94 million XRP in liquidations, representing roughly $179 million. This places XRP among the most heavily liquidated digital assets in the current market cycle. The scale of these forced position closures highlights rapid fluctuations in leveraged trading activity as traders adjusted their positions around the $1.90 price level. Xaif’s breakdown shows that short positions made up a slightly higher share of the total liquidations at 52%, with long positions accounting for the remaining 48%. This imbalance, although not large, suggests that traders expecting a downward move were more exposed during the period. The liquidation trend reflects how both sides of the market were caught in a tightening price zone, creating an environment where leveraged positions became increasingly vulnerable. XRP LIQUIDATION MAP GOING WILD 94M XRP liquidated in 24h $179M gone. Shorts slightly dominate (52%) as price hits $1.90. Biggest wipeout: 38.8M XRP Longs loaded at $1.5–$2.0 Shorts trapped at $2.5–$3.0 https://t.co/WCQU3RkvZV pic.twitter.com/qL8BtEK4gb — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) November 21, 2025 Key Levels Behind the Liquidation Surge According to the data, the largest single liquidation event reached 38.8 million XRP. This figure alone illustrates the high-risk leverage levels deployed by traders attempting to anticipate momentum. Xaif pointed to long positions being heavily concentrated between $1.50 and $2.00, a zone where traders were attempting to capitalize on the potential continuation of upward momentum. In contrast, short positions were positioned between $2.50 and $3.00, showing that many traders had anticipated a rejection or resistance before XRP could test higher ranges. The liquidation density map suggests that long traders entered aggressively at lower support zones, while short traders attempted to capitalize on expected exhaustion near higher resistance points. Price failing to reach the upper short-heavy regions and instead retracing downward resulted in a significant portion of leveraged positions being wiped out. Market Impact and Current Conditions XRP’s current price at $1.90 aligns with a local decline that saw the asset fall by more than 10% within the same 24-hour window. This downward movement contributed directly to the elevated number of liquidations, as traders with insufficient margin found their positions closed automatically. The USD value of liquidations exceeded $179 million. This supports the weight of trading activity around these price ranges. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The long-to-short ratio, while near even, leans slightly toward short dominance. This indicates a cautious market leaning, where traders may be expecting further corrections or at least a reduced probability of an immediate breakout above the psychological $2.00 level. What This Might Mean for XRP Moving Forward If liquidation levels remain elevated, XRP may enter a phase of reduced leveraged exposure as traders become more conservative. Historically, periods of high liquidation often lead to temporary stabilization, as extreme leverage is removed from the market. Should the $1.50–$2.00 long-heavy zone continue to hold, it may act as a foundation for renewed confidence. Conversely, failure to maintain support in this region may invite additional downward pressure. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to Pal, his approach involves continuing to add to positions throughout the sell-off while accepting the likelihood of large swings in performance, as he explained in an X post on November 21. The finance veteran framed this as a long-term, multi-year strategy designed to capitalize on deep market dislocations, though he stressed that every investor’s circumstances and time horizons differ. “The current price action is showing no signs of letting up yet even though we are massively oversold, but having lived through huge rapid de-rsking events before in many markets, this too shall pass. My strategy is to add into these sell offs but Im ok with large swings in P&L in a long-term multi-year trend as I’ve explained many times, but everyone circumstances and time horizons are different,” Pal said. Pal’s conviction in this method stems from what he sees as familiar patterns in the current decline. He described today’s market as unusually intense, driven by rapid unwinding of positions and thinning liquidity as concerns circulate about weakened market-maker balance sheets. The environment, he noted, closely resembles past shocks that initially appeared alarming but later reversed with equal force. Lessons from past crashes To illustrate this, he pointed back to 2021, when a four-week correction drove ( BTC ) down by more than half its value and pushed Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ) even lower before all three rebounded sharply to reach new highs. Earlier cycles show a similar dynamic, including a severe 72% plunge from 2019 into 2020 during the pandemic and a series of large Bitcoin drawdowns between 2016 and 2017 that repeatedly jolted the market before the uptrend resumed. Crypto market past performance. Source: Raoul Pal Additionally, alternative cryptocurrencies consistently experienced steeper losses during those phases, reflecting a pattern he believes is visible again today. Although the current price action shows few signs of easing and the market appears heavily oversold, Pal argues that the broader macro backdrop remains supportive. To him, the present turbulence fits within the long history of rapid de-risking events that eventually give way to renewed strength. With traders confronting sharp declines and uncertainty heightened by rumour rather than concrete negative developments, he suggested that stepping back from screens and temporarily disconnecting can help restore clarity. Despite the discomfort, he maintained that such periods, while painful, are not outside the norm for crypto’s long-running cycles.

This strategic move aims to accelerate power plant construction for its massive AI data centers, creating ripple effects across technology and cryptocurrency sectors. For crypto enthusiasts, this signals a major shift in how large-scale computing operations secure energy resources. Why Meta Electricity Trading Matters for Tech Giants Meta’s push into electricity trading represents a fundamental shift in how technology companies approach energy security. The company, along with Microsoft, is asking federal regulators for permission to trade power directly in wholesale markets. This approach allows Meta to make long-term commitments to purchase electricity from new power plants while maintaining flexibility to resell excess power when needed. Urvi Parekh, Meta’s head of global energy, explained the rationale to Bloomberg: “Power plant developers want to know that the consumers of power are willing to put skin in the game. Without Meta taking a more active voice in the need to expand the amount of power that’s on the system, it’s not happening as quickly as we would like.” The Unprecedented Energy Demands of AI Data Centers The driving force behind Meta’s electricity trading ambitions is the explosive growth of artificial intelligence. AI data centers consume enormous amounts of power, creating energy requirements that existing grids struggle to meet. Bloomberg highlights the scale of this challenge, noting that at least three new gas-powered plants will need construction just to power Meta’s Louisiana data center campus. AI model training requires continuous high-power computing Data center energy consumption has doubled in three years Traditional energy infrastructure cannot keep pace with demand Tech companies must become energy market participants How Energy Markets Are Evolving for Technology Meta’s entry into electricity trading follows Apple’s successful approval for similar activities. This trend indicates a broader movement where technology companies are no longer passive energy consumers but active market participants. The strategy offers multiple benefits: Advantage Description Impact Price Stability Long-term power purchase agreements Predictable operating costs Risk Management Ability to resell excess power Reduced financial exposure Infrastructure Development Direct investment in new plants Faster capacity expansion Market Influence Active participation in pricing Better negotiating position What This Means for Cryptocurrency Mining Operations The energy strategies of major tech companies have significant implications for cryptocurrency mining. As Meta and other giants secure large energy blocks, they could potentially: Increase competition for affordable electricity Drive innovation in energy-efficient computing Create new models for energy procurement Influence regulatory approaches to large energy consumers Cryptocurrency miners, who also require massive amounts of reliable power, may need to adopt similar strategies to ensure their energy needs are met in increasingly competitive markets. The Future of Power Consumption in Digital Industries Meta’s electricity trading initiative signals a new era where digital infrastructure and energy markets become deeply intertwined. The success of this approach could establish a blueprint for how technology companies manage their growing energy footprints while supporting grid stability and new power generation development. Frequently Asked Questions Which companies are seeking electricity trading approval? Meta and Microsoft are both seeking federal approval for electricity trading, while Apple has already received similar approval. Who is Meta’s head of global energy? Urvi Parekh serves as Meta’s head of global energy and has been instrumental in developing the company’s electricity trading strategy. What specific data center project demonstrates these energy needs? Meta’s Louisiana data center campus requires at least three new gas-powered plants to meet its electricity demands, highlighting the scale of AI infrastructure energy requirements. How does this affect cryptocurrency mining operations? Increased competition for electricity resources and potential changes in energy market dynamics could impact cryptocurrency mining operations that also require substantial power resources. Meta’s revolutionary move into electricity trading represents a pivotal moment for technology and energy markets. By becoming active participants in power markets, tech giants are not just consuming energy—they’re shaping its future distribution and availability. This strategic shift will have lasting implications for AI development, cryptocurrency operations, and global energy infrastructure for years to come.

With liquidity being aggressively flushed above and below the price, ETH is approaching a major decision point where either a relief rebound or a deeper capitulation into the lower demand zones may unfold. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart ETH has continued its sharp corrective leg, sliding from the $3.5K–$3.6K supply zone and breaking decisively below both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages. This breakdown has placed the asset directly inside the $2.7K–$2.85K demand region, which previously acted as the launchpad for the July breakout. The daily market structure remains firmly bearish, with a clear sequence of lower highs and lower lows. The descending channel, combined with the failed retest of the 200-day MA, suggests that sellers are still in full control. The current zone around $2.7K is where the price last accumulated before the August rally. A clean loss of this area would expose the next major decision level at $2.45K–$2.55K, where long-term bids previously stepped in. On the other hand, any sustained recovery must begin with a reclaim of $3K and a close back above the 100-day MA to signal a meaningful shift in momentum. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour timeframe highlights the precision of the downtrend. The asset continues respecting the descending trendline originating from the $4.2K breakdown, and each retest of this trendline has generated new waves of selling. ETH has now reached the lower boundary of the descending channel while sitting inside the $2.7K demand block. Short-term liquidity sweeps have been occurring on both sides of the range, indicating increasing volatility and the potential formation of a local bottom. If buyers defend the current channel low, the first upside target becomes the $3.05K–$3.15K imbalance region, followed by a more significant test of the $3.45K supply area. Without a clear breakout above the trendline, however, any rebound is more likely to remain corrective rather than structural. Onchain Analysis By Shayan The two-week liquidation heatmap reveals that ETH is surrounded by dense liquidation clusters above the current price, particularly between $3.1K and $3.6K. These zones reflect the heavy accumulation of short positions and forced exits during the recent drop. Historically, when price enters a deep liquidity vacuum below major clusters, markets often overshoot to the downside before staging a volatile rebound as liquidity above price becomes the next target. Currently, clear liquidity voids sit above $3.2K, matching the major daily fair value gap. These areas tend to act as magnets during rapid corrections. With liquidity compressed below and large unfilled pockets above, ETH is approaching a pivotal zone. A temporary capitulation into the lower demand region cannot be ruled out, but this same motion has historically preceded strong recovery phases once exhausted sellers are cleared.

An extremely small-scale Solo CK miner has mined a block single-handedly, earning approximately 3,146 BTC and approximately $265,000 in transaction fees at current prices. According to on-chain data, the miner's computing power at the time the block was discovered was just 6 terahashes per second (TH/s). For comparison, the Bitcoin network's average hash rate in October was 855.7 exahashes per second (EH/s). This means the miner's share represents only 0.0000007% of the network, or about 1/7 billionth of the total. Related News: Bloomberg Analyst Responds to Claims That “Bitcoin Is Dead” CKpool founder Con Kolivas, in a statement on X, said that the probability of a miner of this size solving a block every day is one in 180 million, and that the event involves exceptional luck. This block was the 308th solo block mined using the CKpool software, marking the first such achievement in nearly three months. Considered one of the luckiest solo mining examples in recent years, this event surpassed previous similar cases. In 2022, a miner with 126 TH/s managed to mine a block with a probability of 1 in 1.3 million on a network that was around 170 EH/s at the time. *This is not investment advice.

Despite several bounce attempts, both the USDT and BTC pairs are struggling below key resistance levels. Buyers have failed to reclaim momentum, and the price action remains confined within bearish structures. XRP Price Technical Research By Shayan The USDT Pair XRPUSDT broke down decisively from the descending channel structure and is now trading below the $2 key support level, which has now turned into a resistance zone. The recent move has been sharp, with the price falling toward the next major demand area around $1.75. The RSI is also nearing oversold levels, currently around 30, which may suggest a short-term bounce. However, without reclaiming the $2 level, the structure remains bearish. If selling pressure continues, the next downside target lies near the $1.50 range. The BTC Pair Against Bitcoin, XRP is showing relative weakness as well. The price is struggling to hold above the 2,200 SAT mark and has failed to break through the confluence of the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, both acting as dynamic resistance near the 2,400 SAT zone, which is a major barrier to upside continuation itself. The RSI on this pair is neutral around 46, signaling that the market still lacks momentum in either direction. A breakdown below the 2,000 SAT support level could trigger a further decline toward the 1,700 SAT zone and even deeper toward the critical 1,500 SAT area.

The injunction was granted after the Court found a “serious issue to be tried” regarding Maple’s alleged misuse of Core Foundation’s confidential information and breach of a 24-month exclusivity clause. Under the order, Maple is prohibited from launching or promoting syrupBTC, its allegedly competing product, and from dealing in CORE tokens without prior written consent pending arbitration. Partnership Gone Wrong According to Core Foundation, the partnership began in early 2025, and both parties collaborated on lstBTC, a Bitcoin yield product designed to keep BTC securely custodied at firms like BitGo. Core said it invested significant financial and technical resources into development, marketing, and subsidies, and noted that the partnership’s public launch at Consensus Hong Kong in February 2025 was well received. At that time, Maple Finance reportedly managed less than $500 million in assets, and Core stated that early revenue and traction from the Bitcoin Yield product beginning in April 2025 contributed to Maple’s rapid growth. Core alleged that by mid-2025, Maple began using its confidential information and work product while simultaneously accepting Core’s resources to develop syrupBTC, which it considers a directly competitive product in breach of exclusivity. In a judgment dated September 26 and published on October 30 of this year, Justice Jalil Asif KC held that damages would not be an adequate remedy due to the risk of Maple dealing in or shedding CORE tokens and the potential head start Maple would gain by launching its competing offering. Core Foundation also stated that Maple had brought over $150 million in Bitcoin to the early OTC version of the yield product, and that, based on Maple’s representations, the Bitcoin was expected to be held in fully bankruptcy-remote segregated portfolios at reputable custodians. It added that the BTC Yield product included CORE price protection via third-party put options, and that it had paid out millions of dollars on these protections until Maple’s alleged breaches, at which point Core sought the injunction and terminated the agreements. Core Foundation said Maple has since indicated it must declare an impairment affecting Bitcoin lenders, but Core said it is unclear why Maple cannot return the Bitcoin or whether Maple has the right to impair it, while citing its understanding that the assets were held with licensed custodians. Core described Maple’s position as concerning and said it is pursuing legal action. Response In response, Maple Finance said it “stands firmly in defense of lender rights” and stressed that there is no impact on its broader business operations. The on-chain asset manager denied any wrongdoing and tweeted , “Core Foundation’s actions are directly against lender interests. Maple denies any allegations of wrongdoing on its part and will be pursuing all available remedies aggressively to ensure Core Foundation is held responsible for the consequences of their actions.” The post Core Foundation Claims Maple Misused Confidential Data: Court Says ‘Serious Issue to Be Tried’ appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|DeFi,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|CORE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-11-22 17:56:52

Rather than presenting a speculative vision, Schwartz focused on the practical limitations of single-network dominance and the technical reasons XRP was engineered differently from other major blockchains. Crypto enthusiast Diana highlighted the exchange, underscoring why it is being regarded as one of the most consequential XRP-related interviews of the year. BREAKING: Ripple CTO Says “Bitcoin Can’t Win Alone — XRP Was Built to Replace the Global Finance in Next Couple of Years"" @JoelKatz , Ripple’s CTO, sat down with @EleanorTerrett and @Matt_Hougan , and honestly… this might be one of the most important XRP interviews of the… pic.twitter.com/qqIl7kxhpe — Diana (@InvestWithD) November 20, 2025 Why Bitcoin Alone Cannot Sustain a Global Financial System Schwartz made it clear that a single-chain financial world is not realistic. His position emphasized that the broader ecosystem advances together or not at all, and that Bitcoin cannot serve as the sole foundational layer for global transactions. He pointed to early Bitcoin tribalism as a factor that slowed industry progress, noting that institutions now increasingly recognize that XRP does not compete with Bitcoin’s narrative but fills structural gaps Bitcoin cannot address. According to him, multiple networks will be required to support a scalable, resilient financial architecture, with XRP positioned as one of the essential components. XRP’s Design Choices and Their Functional Impact Schwartz highlighted that XRP was built with a distinct architecture, not derived from Bitcoin’s codebase. He identified several features that differentiate it from Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, stressing that XRP does not rely on proof-of-work and introduced issued assets earlier than others. Its built-in decentralized exchange and its curated foundation of financial primitives formed part of his explanation for why the XRP Ledger is optimized for settlement-oriented use cases. He described the XRP Ledger as intentionally structured for financial operations rather than generalized computation. He also reiterated that any infrastructure Ripple builds inherently benefits XRP. Because XRP is the network’s universal settlement asset, fee token, and neutral bridge with no counterparty, its role persists even when end-users are not directly aware of its involvement. Each liquidity pool, new stablecoin, or tokenized asset deployed on the ledger automatically increases XRP’s background utility, as the network routes trades through it when necessary. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Projected Role of XRP in the Coming Financial Transition Schwartz stated that significant portions of traditional finance will migrate on-chain over the next several years. In his view, banking functions, lending activities, investment products, and international payments will operate on blockchain rails, with XRP serving as a neutral settlement component in this transition. He framed this evolution as a change for ordinary users and institutions, driven by efficiency and reliability rather than ideology. An X user, Derivatives Trading, questioned the measurable basis for XRP’s role in institutional settlement, asking what concrete data supports these claims. Diana responded by pointing to observable metrics such as XRP Ledger DEX volume patterns, On-Demand Liquidity corridor activity, settlement finality of three to five seconds , stable, low transaction costs, and strong liquidity indicators from exchanges frequently engaged during ODL operations. She emphasized that these data points are verifiable on-chain and not promotional assertions. This latest discussion reinforces how Ripple’s leadership views XRP’s structural role in a multi-chain financial future, with a focus on measurable performance and system-level design rather than narrative positioning.

KuCoin CEO BC Wong and James Pinch joined a fireside chat moderated by Winston McLaren, Australian Head of Compliance, titled “Regulated, Connected, Converging: The Future of Digital and Traditional Finance.” The session reaffirmed KuCoin’s commitment to trust, localisation, and long-term investment in Australia’s digital asset landscape. The discussion explored Australia’s transition from early crypto experimentation to integrating digital assets into mainstream finance. Structured around three pillars— Regulated, Connected, and Converging —the conversation outlined the foundations required for crypto to become a trusted, everyday asset class. “Security and compliance are structural, not reactive,” said BC Wong. “KuCoin has made significant investments in secure, transparent infrastructure, including the launch of our $2 Billion Trust Project earlier this year. Our strategy for Australia follows the same principle: regulation acts as a stabiliser for innovation, not a restriction.” Drawing on his extensive experience in traditional financial services, James Pinch added: “Clear and progressive regulation is essential for broad crypto adoption. While global regulatory frameworks remain fragmented, they are expected to consolidate and mature over the next 5–10 years. Regulators worldwide are becoming increasingly open-minded, making ongoing dialogue and collaboration critical.” Localisation was another key theme. “Being local” means hiring Australian talent, understanding domestic regulations, tailoring products, and contributing meaningfully to the local economy. KuCoin reiterated its confidence in the Australian team to adapt global products responsibly while prioritising consumer protection and education. These values—discipline, integrity, patience, and long-term commitment—align strongly with Australian expectations. The session also featured KuCoin’s new brand film with global brand ambassador Adam Scott. Debuting in Australia, the campaign highlights shared values of discipline, resilience, and long-term focus, further supported by KuCoin’s role as Official Partner and exclusive crypto exchange partner of the 2025 BMW Australian PGA Championship. Looking to the future, BC Wong noted that digital and traditional finance are no longer separate systems but “one ecosystem with two origins—now converging.” As assets, payments, and trading continue to digitise, KuCoin aims to provide secure, transparent access to this integrated financial future. This discussion builds on KuCoin’s broader Australian expansion, including new roles across compliance, operations, cybersecurity, and product development. With a focus on regulatory alignment and cultural integration, KuCoin aims to support a more mature and trusted crypto ecosystem in Australia.
