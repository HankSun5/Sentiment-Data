40700758,https://coingape.com/?post_type=markets&p=240475,1740259728,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,PEPE Price Rebounds 6% as Analyst Predicts Ethereum Gains from Bybit Losses,https://coingape.com/markets/pepe-price-rebounds-6-as-analyst-predicts-ethereum-gains-from-bybit-losses/,"PEPE price surged 6%, defying market turmoil after Bybit’s $1.4 billion hack—could this be the start of a major rebound? PEPE rebounds 6% as traders bet on Ethereum gains from Bybit Hack PEPE suffered considerable losses on Friday, mirroring the $75 billion crypto market capitulation in the aftermath of the Bybit hack . The Bybit exploit, linked to the notorious Lazarus Group , saw the exchange lose over 400,000 ETH—worth approximately $1.4 billion at the time of the breach. Given that the stolen funds were in ETH, Ethereum-hosted assets like PEPE bore the brunt of the sell-off. PEPE’s price plummeted by 10% on Friday, while rival meme coins such as Dogecoin and Solana’s Dogwifhat (WIF) contained their losses below 5% in the immediate hours following the hack. PEPE Price Action, Feb 22, 2025 | Source: TradingView However, the broader crypto industry quickly rallied to provide support. Binance transferred over 50,000 ETH to Bybit, helping to stabilize liquidity for traders seeking withdrawals. Additionally, Bybit’s CEO reassured users about the safety of their funds. These interventions appear to have averted a systemic market collapse reminiscent of previous exchange mishaps, such as the FTX crash, which saw global crypto market capitalization shrink by nearly 50% within 10 days. However, 24 hours of the Bybit hack, PEPE price showed early signs of recovery, climbing 6% to reclaim the $0.00009 level at press time. Bulls bet $9M on PEPE rally as analysts hint at Ethereum buy-back to offset Bybit losses At press time, the Bybit exploit remains unresolved, with the stolen funds still sitting in a series of cold wallets identified by Arkham Intelligence. While Bybit’s security team collaborates with law enforcement agencies, speculation has emerged over how the exchange might recover the stolen assets. Some market analysts suggest that Bybit may be forced to repurchase the equivalent of the stolen ETH to reimburse customers and balance its books. Prominent analyst Ash Crypto echoed this view while alerting his 1.6 million followers on X (formerly Twitter) about the hack on Friday: “BYBIT hacker can’t sell $1.45 billion ETH for USDC or USDT because it will get frozen by Circle or Tether. So he just took $1.46 billion selling pressure from ETH. For BYBIT to cover customer ETH, they will have to buy $1.46 billion worth of ETH from (the) market.” — Ash Crypto, (Analyst) Feb. 21, 2025 With approximately 120 million ETH in circulation, the 400,000 ETH stolen from Bybit represents about 3% of total supply. If Bybit moves to repurchase the stolen ETH from the open market, it could significantly constrain available liquidity, potentially triggering a sharp price surge for Ethereum and other ecosystem tokens. Meanwhile, PEPE’s 6% price recovery appears to be bolstered by aggressive positioning in the derivatives market. Data from Coinglass, a leading on-chain analytics platform, suggests that strategic traders are already speculating on a continued rebound. PEPE Liquidation Map, Feb 22, 2025 | Coinglass Coinglass ’ liquidation heatmaps track the total capital deployed in leveraged long and short positions for specific assets, providing real-time insights into shifts in market sentiment. As the broader market stabilized, PEPE traders aggressively built up long positions. The latest data indicates that PEPE long positions have reached $9 million, significantly outpacing short positions at just $2.9 million—a disparity of nearly 70%. This substantial leverage gap implies that, as the market recovery unfolds, short traders may be reluctant to cover their positions, further fueling upside momentum. While PEPE remains below the $0.000010 threshold and has yet to fully erase its 10% losses from the Friday crash, the growing long interest suggests sustained bullish momentum in the days ahead. If Ethereum’s price action strengthens due to anticipated buy-backs, PEPE’s recovery phase could gain additional traction, positioning it for further upside. PEPE Price Forecast: Close Above $0.000011 Could Kickstart Recovery Phase PEPE price forecast suggests an emerging recovery phase as the Ethereum-hosted memecoin rebounds 6% following Friday’s sharp drop triggered by the Bybit hack. The chart shows a notable shift in momentum, with PEPE rising above the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) at $0.00000948, indicating that recent buyers have been willing to pay slightly higher prices to secure their positions. This suggests competitive demand, with traders positioning ahead of a potential full recovery to pre-Bybit crash levels. PEPE Price Forecast The daily candlestick structure presents a mixed outlook. The lower Bollinger Band has provided dynamic support, preventing deeper declines, while PEPE’s latest green candle signals an early attempt at a trend reversal. However, a confirmed breakout above the upper Donchian Channel resistance at $0.00001144 is crucial to sustain a bullish continuation. A close above this level could accelerate momentum, driving prices toward the $0.00001200 resistance. On the downside, failure to hold above VWAP could invite another wave of selling, potentially retesting Friday’s lows near $0.00000796. The volume delta remains negative overall, suggesting sellers are still present, but the uptick in green bars during the daily time frame signals a bump in PEPE spot market liquidity as buying interest gradually returns. If bulls maintain dominance in the derivatives markets, PEPE could regain lost ground, solidifying its recovery phase.

Kanye West announced that he will launch his own token next week. However, in his previous statements, he said that all tokens were for the purpose of scamming his followers and declared that he would never release a token. On the other hand, there may be an unusual partnership in the memecoin that West will launch. West retweeted Binance founder Changpeng Zhao’s tweet that “decentralized exchanges are very hard to use.” In addition, it is noteworthy that the only person West, who has 33 million followers, follows on Twitter is Changpeng Zhao.

VanEck Research Weighs In,https://thecoinrise.com/can-bitcoin-pay-off-u-s-debt-vaneck-research-weighs-in/,"The idea of using Bitcoin to reduce the U.S. national debt has been making headlines, especially in President Donald Trump’s speech at the Nashville Bitcoin Conference in July 2024. Following his remarks, the US. Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced a bill proposing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. She said the bill was proposed to help cut down the country’s massive debt. As reported by Crypto.News, a new report from VanEck, an investment management firm, sheds light on whether this plan is feasible. What VanEck’s Research Says According to VanEck’s latest findings, the U.S. government would need to buy one million bitcoins over the next five years and hold them for 20 years. If this plan goes ahead, by 2049, the total value of these bitcoins could reach around $21 trillion. However, this would only cover approximately 18% of the national debt, which is expected to hit $116 trillion by then. It was stated in the report that to achieve these figures, Bitcoin’s price would need to grow at an average rate of 25% per year, eventually reaching $21 billion per coin. Meanwhile, the national debt is projected to rise by 5% annually. While Bitcoin has seen much growth in the past, there is no guarantee it will maintain this pace for the next two decades. In addition, the report mentioned that the acquisition of one million bitcoins would bring about many challenges. This is because the total supply of Bitcoin is currently capped at 21 million. So, any attempts at large government purchases could drive up prices. This will make acquisitions more expensive. Could Bitcoin Ever Erase U.S. Debt? Despite rumors that Bitcoin could wipe out U.S. debt, VanEck’s research suggests otherwise. Paying off the entire debt would require over five million bitcoins at today’s projected growth rates. However, since only 21 million bitcoins exist, this is simply impossible. Furthermore, even if Bitcoin reached $1 million per coin, the U.S. government would still need 36 million bitcoins to clear its debt. On top of that, selling such a massive amount would likely crash the market, further diminishing the value of the reserves. Bitcoin as a Partial Solution While Bitcoin could contribute to debt reduction, it is far from a complete solution. As Senator Lummis initially stated, the aim is to reduce debt, not eliminate it. VanEck’s research supports this perspective, showing that while a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve might help, it is not a magic fix. Since Senator Lummis introduced the bill, several state lawmakers across the U.S. have been considering similar proposals for Bitcoin reserves. For instance, Utah’s Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Bill recently passed the House with an 8-1 vote and is now under review by the Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee. Also, other states, including Florida, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Oklahoma, have also moved to establish Bitcoin reserves. The post Can Bitcoin Pay Off U.S. Debt?

In Berkshire Hathaway’s annual letter to shareholders, Buffett warns the stability and purchasing power of the US dollar can be easily eroded. “Paper money can see its value evaporate if fiscal folly prevails. In some countries, this reckless practice has become habitual, and, in our country’s short history, the U.S. has come close to the edge. Fixed-coupon bonds provide no protection against runaway currency.” Buffett says capitalism itself is suffering from historic levels of abuse within the system, although its power to promote prosperity remains unmatched. “One way or another, the sensible – better yet imaginative – deployment of savings by citizens is required to propel an ever-growing societal output of desired goods and services. This system is called capitalism. It has its faults and abuses – in certain respects more egregious now than ever – but it also can work wonders unmatched by other economic systems… The American process has not always been pretty – our country has forever had many scoundrels and promoters who seek to take advantage of those who mistakenly trust them with their savings. But even with such malfeasance – which remains in full force today – and also much deployment of capital that eventually floundered because of brutal competition or disruptive innovation, the savings of Americans has delivered a quantity and quality of output beyond the dreams of any colonist.” The 94 year-old Berkshire Hathaway CEO says it won’t be long before he ends his historic 60-year tenure at the firm. “At 94, it won’t be long before Greg Abel replaces me as CEO and will be writing the annual letters… We are impartial in our choice of equity vehicles, investing in either variety based upon where we can best deploy your (and my family’s) savings. Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities.

Analys Weigh In,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/could-this-0-00020-token-eclipse-solana-and-ripples-early-success-analys-weigh-in/,"As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve in 2025, THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN has emerged as a potential game-changer, currently priced at $0.20. This Trump-inspired memecoin has captured significant attention, raising over $3 million in its presale phase. To understand its potential, let’s compare it to the early success stories of Solana and Ripple, two established players in the crypto space. Historical Growth Analysis: Solana (SOL) Solana has been a solid performer in the crypto landscape, known for its high-speed transactions and low fees. Its dual-layer consensus system, combining Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of History (PoH), allows for high throughput and low latency. This technological edge has made Solana a preferred platform for DeFi, NFT marketplaces, and gaming applications. Solana’s growth has been impressive, with its price reaching $219.47 and a 24-hour trading volume of $3.25 billion. The network’s ability to handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) under optimal conditions has positioned it as a strong competitor in the high-throughput blockchain space. Historical Growth Analysis: Ripple (XRP) Ripple has focused on revolutionizing cross-border payments, partnering with over 300 financial institutions globally. Its XRP Ledger processes 1,500 TPS, with transactions settling in 3-5 seconds at a cost of around $0.0002 per transaction. Despite facing regulatory challenges, including an ongoing legal battle with the SEC, Ripple has maintained its position as a leader in the payments sector. The outcome of its legal issues could significantly impact its adoption within institutional finance. THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN: The Trending Memecoin Set To Explode ACT FAST! USE PROMO CODE MAGA50X NOW AND CLAIM YOUR 50% EXTRA BONUS! THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN has shown remarkable potential, with its presale raising $3,076,115.19. Currently priced at $0.0001978 per token, it’s set to list at $0.007, indicating substantial growth potential. Key factors driving THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN’s potential include: A limited supply of 100 billion tokens, creating scarcity Strong community backing with over 60,000 supporters Unique blend of political branding and crypto innovation Analysts predict that THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN could reach $1 in 2025, potentially delivering significant returns for early investors. Comparative Market Potential While Solana and Ripple have established themselves in specific niches – Solana in high-performance blockchain applications and Ripple in cross-border payments – THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN is positioning itself as a community-driven, politically charged token with broad appeal. The current market environment, characterized by increasing regulatory clarity and institutional adoption, could benefit all three tokens. However, MAGACOIN’s unique positioning and viral potential could lead to explosive growth similar to or surpassing the early days of Solana and Ripple. Don’t Miss the Rise of THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN – Invest at $0.00020 Today! THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN presents a unique opportunity in the evolving crypto landscape of 2025. With its strong community support, limited supply, and potential for viral growth, it could eclipse the early success of both Solana and Ripple. The token’s current price of $0.20 offers an attractive entry point for investors seeking high-growth potential.

SHIB’s technical indicators have analysts debating a potential rally, while LTC is navigating a key price point. BlockDAG, having raised over $197 million and sold 18.5 billion coins in its presale, is making waves in the Web3 space, attracting a massive influx of developer talent through its HackerEarth partnership. This article explores these exciting developments, providing insights into the Shiba Inu breakout forecast, Litecoin’s potential, and BlockDAG’s ambitious vision for the future of decentralized technology. Shiba Inu Breakout Forecast: A 23% Surge on the Horizon? The Shiba Inu breakout forecast is a major topic among traders following the coin’s earlier price climb. A subsequent dip has raised questions about the forecast’s validity. However, some technical observers highlight a golden cross formation on the daily chart, a potentially bullish signal. The Shiba Inu breakout forecast also considers a key Fibonacci retracement level where the coin found support. A prior golden cross event led to a substantial price increase, prompting speculation about a possible 23% rally. The Shiba Inu breakout forecast is being closely watched by many in the crypto community. Litecoin Price Trends: Targeting $140 and Beyond? The Litecoin (LTC) price prediction is attracting attention as the coin holds above $126, a level some view as a springboard for further gains. Some analysts suggest that breaking through this resistance could propel LTC toward $140 or higher, particularly given improving market sentiment related to regulatory clarity. Expert LTC price predictions point to potential higher targets if trading volume remains robust. However, mixed indicators have led to some caution among traders. A symmetrical triangle pattern on daily charts adds to the uncertainty. Upcoming ETF news could also impact Litecoin’s outlook, with the possibility of reaching $200 if conditions are favorable. BlockDAG x HackerEarth: Building the Next Generation of Web3 BlockDAG’s partnership with HackerEarth is creating significant excitement. By hosting global hackathons, BlockDAG is engaging over 10,000 developers. This initiative highlights BlockDAG’s commitment to building a vibrant Web3 ecosystem. With over $197 million raised and 18.5 billion coins sold, BlockDAG’s presale is demonstrating incredible momentum. Early participants have seen substantial returns, and there is talk of even greater returns in the future. These hackathons are not just for show. BlockDAG aims to be the leading developer-friendly Layer 1 platform, facilitating the creation of over 200 new Web3 projects across various sectors. This focus on developer engagement is expected to drive innovation, resulting in dApps tailored to specific markets and industries. BlockDAG’s leadership emphasizes the crucial role of the HackerEarth partnership in attracting top-tier talent. Localized events ensure that developers from all regions have the chance to contribute to the Web3 revolution. BlockDAG’s presale success reflects the project’s growing community and potential for mainstream adoption. With its focus on scalability, developer experience, and real-world applications, BlockDAG is positioning itself as a key player in the blockchain arena. A Quick Recap Traders are carefully observing market trends, including the Shiba Inu breakout forecast. The coin’s earlier price surge has sparked discussions about the potential for another upward move. Litecoin’s price prediction is also in focus as the coin consolidates above a key level, with analysts speculating about a push toward higher targets. BlockDAG’s collaboration with HackerEarth is expected to accelerate Web3 development.

Franklin Templeton’s Franklin Crypto Index ETF (EZPZ) has attracted around $2.5 million in net assets since launching on Feb. 20, while Hashdex’s Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF (NCIQ) has gathered just over $1 million since its Feb. 14 debut. By comparison, Franklin Templeton’s spot Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) saw significantly higher interest, pulling in approximately $50 million on its first day in January 2024, with Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) reaching nearly $240 million on its debut. Diversification Limits and Regulatory Barriers The two ETFs aim to provide investors with exposure to a diverse crypto index. However, due to regulatory restrictions, they currently hold only Bitcoin and Ether, which dominate their portfolios. The hope is to expand to other cryptocurrencies pending regulatory approval.

According to data provided by Binance and analyzed by CryptoQuant, the number of Binance Pay users tripled from the previous year, reaching 41.7 million. This rapid adoption highlights the increasing role of crypto in everyday transactions. Stablecoins Lead the Charge The total transaction volume processed through Binance Pay in 2024 stood at $72.4 billion, the report found. This is a notable rise from $2.5 billion in 2021. Stablecoins, particularly Tether (USDT), dominated Binance Pay transactions as it accounted for 80% of the total payment volume, which equated to $57 billion. Top crypto assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Binance Coin (BNB) followed suit, contributing $6.6 billion, $2.4 billion, and $2.2 billion, respectively, and represented 9%, 3%, and 3% of the total transaction value. Another popular stablecoin, USD Coin (USDC), exhibited notable year-over-year growth, with a 1,338% increase in transaction count and a 48% rise in transaction volume. Broader market trends indicate a rise in high-frequency token transactions on Binance Pay, with Solana (SOL) leading the surge. In fact, CryptoQuant found that SOL payments reached $724 million in 2024 and represented a 656% year-over-year increase. During the same period, Bitcoin transactions rose by 73% to $6.6 billion, while Ethereum payments grew by 69% to $2.4 billion. USDC and BNB also recorded notable growth, increasing by 48% and 29%, respectively. Binance Pay’ s expansion aligns with the overall growth of the crypto market and Binance’s increasing role in facilitating transactions. This trend is further validated by a significant rise in Binance’s cryptocurrency reserves. The USD value of its Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, and USDC reserves exceeded $100 billion in 2024, marking a 137% increase from the start of the year when reserves stood at $43 billion. The increasing use of Binance Pay reflects a larger global trend as cryptocurrency ownership continues to rise. Crypto Adoption Global cryptocurrency ownership witnessed a 13% increase in 2024, rising from 583 million in January to 659 million in December, according to a report by Crypto.com. Bitcoin ownership grew by 13.1%, reaching 337 million users and accounting for over 51% of all crypto owners. Ethereum saw a 13.6% increase, with owners rising from 125 million to 142 million, and represented 21.7% of global ownership. Additionally, between 300,000 and 1.2 million people may have invested in BTC through US spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Institutional interest and pro-crypto policies from US President-elect Donald Trump were major factors driving BTC adoption. The report observed that ETH’s growth was fueled by Ethereum Layer 2 network rallies following the Dencun upgrade and the launch of spot Ethereum ETFs, which contributed to increased investor participation.

If this happens, we could see XRP usage skyrocket as more financial institutions jump on board, which might drive up its price significantly – we’ll check it out in detail below. While XRP is bringing changes in traditional finance, PlutoChain could bring new functionalities in the Bitcoin space. Their hybrid L2 technology could give Bitcoin’s ecosystem a serious upgrade in the coming weeks. Let’s check out the details. XRP Price Prediction: Japanese Banks’ XRP Adoption Could Signal Major Price Movement – Is $10 on the Horizon? Japan’s financial sector might be on the verge of a major shift toward XRP adoption. SBI Group’s leader Yoshitaka Kitao envisions XRP revolutionizing how Japan’s migrant workers send money home, making transfers faster and cheaper. Industry insiders suggest a massive wave of adoption is building, with potentially 80% of Japanese banks considering XRP integration. This could dramatically boost both trading activity and market liquidity as banks tap into XRP for international transfers. The ripple effect could spread beyond Japan’s borders – if other Asian financial hubs follow suit, we might see unprecedented demand for XRP. Market analyst Farshad Rouhani has set an ambitious target, suggesting XRP could break $10 in early 2025 as Japanese banks roll out XRP-based payment systems. PlutoChain’s Hybrid Layer-2 Solution Could Transform Bitcoin’s Ecosystem Bitcoin continues to face challenges with its core infrastructure – users often encounter lengthy transaction times, high fees, and network bottlenecks that could limit its mainstream adoption. These scaling issues might become even more pressing as usage grows. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could offer a solution through its hybrid Layer-2 architecture that potentially works in parallel with Bitcoin’s main chain. By redirecting transaction traffic to its network, PlutoChain might significantly reduce fees and ease congestion, while potentially solving Bitcoin’s long-standing scalability challenges. The speed difference could be transformative. While Bitcoin typically requires 10 minutes to process blocks, trailing behind networks like Ethereum and Solana, PlutoChain’s Layer-2 solution might achieve block times of approximately 2 seconds. This improvement could enable faster smart contract execution while maintaining the robust security guarantees of Bitcoin’s network. A key feature of PlutoChain is its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. This feature could create a bridge between Bitcoin and the vast ecosystem of Ethereum-based applications. Projects focused on decentralized finance, NFT marketplaces, and emerging AI applications might soon flourish within Bitcoin’s ecosystem, potentially breathing new life into the network. Early performance indicators appear promising – testnet results show PlutoChain could process up to 43,200 transactions per day without experiencing slowdowns, suggesting robust scalability potential. Security is important in PlutoChain’s development approach. The project has undergone comprehensive audits from respected firms including SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi . Regular stress testing could help ensure the network maintains reliability even under heavy load conditions. Community governance stands as another cornerstone of the project. Through its decentralized governance model, PlutoChain could empower users to actively participate in the network’s evolution. Community members might propose changes and vote on crucial protocol decisions, potentially creating a more democratic and user-driven development process. The Bottom Line XRP’s momentum in Japanese banking could drive major price movements, while PlutoChain could gain traction as a potential upgrade in the Bitcoin ecosystem. By tackling Bitcoin’s core challenges with its hybrid Layer-2 solution, this project might revolutionize how we use the world’s largest digital asset – potentially offering faster transactions and lower fees while maintaining Bitcoin’s legendary security. ——- The information in this article does not represent financial or investment advice.

Their discussion about a potential national XRP reserve has ignited speculation – could this be the catalyst to propel XRP to $30? Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could be interesting to watch because of its innovative hybrid Layer-2 solution for Bitcoin. Designed to tackle Bitcoin’s long-standing issues like sluggish transaction speeds and limited scalability, this project could redefine Bitcoin as we know it. Let’s check out the details. XRP Is Showing Great Potential For a $30 Rally – What Are Analysts Saying? XRP is making noise in the crypto community with whispers of a potential $30 price surge, fueled by reported discussions between Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and President Donald Trump. It’s currently trading at $2.73 showing great potential for a breakout, and this high-profile chatter could be the match to light the fuse. XRP 7-day chart, Source: Binance Technically, XRP’s flexing strength, sitting below the 200-day EMA – a bullish bedrock. Resistance at $2.65 and $3.00 is in its crosshairs, and the RSI at 36 approaching oversold territory, a potential short-term bounce. The volume’s simmered to $4.2 billion daily from January’s $10 billion peak, but a Trump-Ripple bombshell could unleash a torrent of buying. A bullish pennant on the daily chart screams breakout potential – $3.66 could fall fast, paving the way to double digits. Historically, XRP thrives on regulatory clarity; a friendly nod from Trump could mirror 2017’s epic rally . Analysts are all-in on this bullish wave. DeepSeek AI model predicts that XRP could skyrocket to $30 in 2025, driven by increased institutional adoption and potential market share in global foreign exchange. On the other hand, CoinCodex experts indicate that XRP could reach as high as $4.24 by April 2025, based on historical data and market trends – significantly lower than the previous prediction but still promising. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Could Transform Bitcoin Into a Hub For Development and Innovation – New Layer-2 Blockchain Offers Smart Contracts and EVM Compatibility PlutoChain ($PLUTO) emerges as a hybrid Layer-2 blockchain with the potential to redefine Bitcoin’s role in the crypto ecosystem. Unlike Bitcoin’s base layer, which excels in security but lags in speed, this project could deliver an impressive upgrade. It offers a block time of 2 seconds compared to Bitcoin’s standard 10 minutes and scales to handle over 43,200 transactions per day, per testnet results. This leap in performance could position Bitcoin as a dynamic platform, not just a passive asset, appealing to enthusiasts eager for broader utility. Developers stand at the forefront of this shift. PlutoChain equips Bitcoin with smart contracts, unlocking the ability to build sophisticated decentralized applications directly on its network. Its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility adds another layer of appeal, enabling developers to seamlessly adapt Ethereum projects for Bitcoin’s infrastructure. This cross-chain potential could streamline workflows and inspire novel solutions, while users benefit from swift, low-fee transactions and access to innovative tools, all underpinned by Bitcoin’s reliability. For the DeFi community, PlutoChain offers a fresh angle. Bitcoin’s DeFi footprint remains minimal next to Ethereum’s and Solana’s. By weaving DeFi capabilities into Bitcoin, such as lending protocols and liquidity pools, PlutoChain could elevate and potentially challenge Ethereum or Solana’s established networks. Security holds firm as a cornerstone. PlutoChain has cleared audits from respected names like SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi , validating its technical integrity. Beyond that, its decentralized governance structure invites community members to shape the project’s future through Discord -based voting, ensuring decisions reflect community priorities and maintain accountability. PlutoChain’s vision taps into Bitcoin’s untapped potential, blending speed, scalability, and programmability. It hands developers a powerful canvas to innovate and users a more versatile network to explore. Conclusion XRP’s potential surge to $30 is gaining traction following discussions between Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Donald Trump, with speculation around a national XRP reserve adding fuel to the rally. Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could expand Bitcoin’s capabilities with its hybrid Layer-2 solution, enabling smart contracts, faster transactions, and DeFi integration. By merging Bitcoin’s security with Ethereum-like functionality, it could lead the way in the blockchain industry. ——- Please keep in mind that this article is not financial advice.

40702703,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=680672,1740262834,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40702703.jpeg,mETH Protocol and Tether lead campaign to freeze Bybit hacker’s bounty,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/meth-protocol-tether-freeze-bybit-hackers/,"The cryptocurrency space was ripe for a black swan event, and one promptly presented itself with the $1.4 billion Bybit hack. However, unlike previous debacles that led to near-total collapses, the industry has managed this episode fairly well—further highlighting the maturity of the digital asset space. In what many are calling the biggest crypto hack of all time, Bybit lost more than $1.4 billion in ETH and stETH early Friday. An investigation is ongoing, however, according to prominent on-chain sleuth ZachXBT, it is highly likely North Korea’s Lazarus group was behind the hack thanks to patterns consistent with their MO. After news of the hack spread, there was initial panic in the markets as Bybit users rushed to get their funds off the CEX, reminded all too well of how FTX folded following a series of panic withdrawals. Fortunately, it did not take long for order to be restored, and the crypto community has shown its resilience and togetherness after the early sensationalism that followed the big headline. mETH protocol joins Binance, others in supporting Bybit Shortly after news got out about the hack, mETH Protocol, a decentralized, permissionless platform built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to stake their ETH and receive liquid staking tokens, known as mETH, released a post-mortem of the hack. The report revealed that the attacker executed multiple transactions to move assets off the platform. According to mETH’s report, 8,000 mETH were swapped for ETH across three transactions via a DEX, and a 15,000 cmETH withdrawal was initiated via mETH Protocol. However, it did not allow the hackers to complete the transaction. The hackers would have gotten away with the funds if not for the protocol’s security measures, which include an 8-hour withdrawal delay built into the protocol to prevent the immediate withdrawal of cmETH. The protocol also blacklisted the exploiter’s address, reducing the cmETH liquidity on Mantle Network and the recovery of about 15,000 cmETH from the exploiter’s address to a recovery address, reinstating the integrity of cmETH supply. Aside from the mETH Protocol, other notable groups in crypto that have stepped up to help include Binance and Tether. On Friday, Paolo Ardoino, the CEO of Tether, revealed his firm had frozen $181,000 worth of the UDST linked to the stolen Bybit funds, thanks to the help of ZachXBT. “Might not be much but it’s honest work,” Ardoino wrote on X. “We keep monitoring.” On Binance’s part, it chose to provide a bridge loan to Bybit so that it can continue to process client withdrawals without delay, ensuring that users can access their funds despite the hack. Bitget has also provided a 64,452 ETH loan to Bybit, and MEXC transferred 12,652 stETH to Bybit’s cold wallet as a sign of solidarity. By now, it is clear that Bybit has weathered the storm from the attack. Following the breach, the firm confirmed that withdrawals were still active but warned that some users might experience delays due to network congestion. Despite the warning, Bybit was able to process 70% of the withdrawal requests successfully, and efforts are underway to address the remaining backlog. Now that the worst has passed, the company is focusing on recovery. On Saturday, Bybit stated it would offer 10% of recovered funds—up to $140 million—to any on-chain security experts who could help the firm get the stolen assets back. In a statement, Bybit co-founder and CEO Ben Zhou highlighted the show of solidarity from the space and promised it was not taken for granted. “We have shared in a dark moment of crypto history, and we’ve proven we are better than the malicious actors,” Zhou said. “We want to officially reward our community who lent us their expertise, experience, and support through the Recovery Bounty Program, and our efforts to make this difficult lesson a valuable one does not stop here.” Ben also noted that the hackers are moving some of the funds to Chainflip.io as a bridge to convert into BTC. He shared an SOS to any bridges with the capacity to freeze or even recover the funds stolen from his exchange, saying “If you are a bridge, Please help us to block and prevent further conversion to other chains.” Projects that have the potential to join the asset-freezing effort According to reports, most of the stolen funds are in native Ethereum, which is not easy to recover since it lacks a centralized freezing mechanism. About 8,000–15,000 mETH and approximately 181,000 USDT were also stolen. While Bybit pursues justice, onlookers have urged more entities currently sitting on the sidelines to join the effort by freezing the assets of the hackers. Some other projects people are expecting to take action include Lido (stETH) and Ethereum (ETH). Lido is a major liquid staking protocol and the issuer of stETH (Staked ETH). It could help by blacklisting stETH addresses, but this might only happen if it is pressured by Bybit or regulators. Also, its decentralized nature makes swift action less likely unless the effort is spearheaded by exchanges or law enforcement. While native ETH cannot be frozen by a single entity because of the chain’s decentralization, a hard fork or rollback could in theory invalidate the stolen funds. This was done once in 2016 when there was a DAO hack. It would require consensus from miners, nodes, and the community. While thought leaders like Arthur Hayes have been talking about the possibility of an Ethereum rollback, given the hack’s scale, there has been no official announcement, and the community’s willingness to do such a thing is uncertain. If there is no overwhelming support from the community, a rollback is unlikely to happen, and blacklisting at the protocol level isn’t feasible, although exchanges could tag and block exploiter addresses. Should the hackers also make the mistake of swapping the stolen ETH into other ERC-20 tokens like USDC, those projects have the ability to freeze funds as long as their contracts permit it. Circle (USDC) has been known to freeze stolen funds in the past, however in those cases, significant USDC had been lost. That is not the case this time. Some analysts are convinced the hackers will eventually convert the ETH to ERC-20 tokens before moving it to BTC and finally fiat via Asian exchanges.

Although it has a current price of $176 , according to CoinGecko, experts say this rise might happen as a result of USD/GBP exchange rates shift. Investors are watching closely because these currency changes can influence SOL’s growth. Meanwhile, Panshibi , a new meme coin, shines as a top crypto pick. Its presale, with only 30 days left, has already raised over $1,000,000. This article explores how USD/GBP fluctuations will push SOL’s price and why Panshibi is gaining attention in the cryptocurrency world today. USD/GBP Swings Push SOL Toward $375 Milestone Based on data from CoinMarketcap , Solana (SOL) trades at approximately $176 on February 21, 2025. Now, experts predict it could reach $375 soon due to the influence of swings in the USD/GBP exchange rate. The rate compares the US dollar to the British pound and its changes affect cryptocurrency prices globally. When the USD strengthens against the GBP, crypto often becomes more appealing to investors using pounds, boosting demand for coins like SOL. SOL’s price has been steady, hovering between $170 and $200 over the past week, with a market cap of about $85.57 billion . Its blockchain is known for fast transactions up to 65,000 per second and low fees of $0.0025 per transaction on an average, according to Solana’s official site. These strengths make it a top crypto pick among developers and investors, supporting its growth. Also, some analysts have noted SOL’s potential to double in value soon, driven by these currency dynamics and its solid technology. Unlike some coins, SOL’s rise is backed by real use in decentralized apps and finance. However, the market remains unpredictable. If the USD/GBP stabilizes, SOL’s climb might slow. Still, with its current trajectory and global economic factors at play, reaching $375 seems within reach. Investors are keeping a close eye on exchange rates, knowing they could push SOL, a top crypto pick even higher in the coming weeks. Panshibi’s Final 30 Days: A Rising Star in Crypto Panshibi, a new meme coin, is in the spotlight as a top crypto pick with just 30 days left in its presale as of February 22, 2025. It has raised over $1,000,000 at stage 4 of the presale with a token price of $0.005. This success shows strong interest from investors. Unlike many meme coins, Panshibi blends fun with real utility, offering AI features and Social-Fi rewards. The coin’s appeal comes from its community focus and unique design. Panshibi is set to offer a 1200% increase during its presale and a 145,000% increase after its launch. This has attracted investors who want profit and stability. It also plans to list on major exchanges, boosting its visibility. With 720 million tokens in the presale already and a total supply of 1.2 billion, Panshibi allows investors to become early adopters. Since meme coins often rely on hype, Panshibi’s mix of innovation, tech and community sets it apart. Now, the final 30 days are critical. Early buyers could see big returns if it follows the path of coins like Shiba Inu, which soared after launch. With strong backing and a clear plan, Panshibi is set to be the top crypto pick for 2025. Conclusion Solana’s push toward $375 reflects how USD/GBP swings shape the crypto market. On other news, Panshibi emerges as a top crypto pick with its presale nearing its end with less than 30 days left. After the launch, Panshibi will list on Uniswap and multiple CEXs. Don’t miss out on this lifetime opportunity, join Panshibi’s presale now and be part of its innovation before it’s too late.

With a growing community, strategic tokenomics, and expanding utility, Pepeto stands out in a crowded market. Dogecoin Set the Standard #Dogecoin started as a joke but became a pioneer in the meme coin sector. Dogecoin attained widespread mainstream popularity because it developed both a powerful community structure and high levels of virality. Over time, Dogecoin gained utility through tipping, payments, and integrations with major businesses. The coin’s duration demonstrates that meme coins can endure longer than momentary speculation. Influential figures, including Elon Musk, contributed to Dogecoin growth. Despite its initial playful nature, Dogecoin remains a key player in the crypto space. Pepe Followed with a Fresh Approach The new investor base came to market through #Pepe because it incorporated contemporary meme-based design elements. Young investors received exposure to Pepe through their engagement with online communities and viral marketing. Users interested in Pepe pursued its deflationary framework because it presented investment benefits that were dissimilar to those of Dogecoin. These developments demonstrated how internet culture defines the future of meme coins as an investment opportunity. The market saw potential in Pepe, which led investors to value it significantly high. Pepe’s success confirmed that meme cryptocurrency investments survive through distinctive branding and restricted token availability mechanisms. Pepeto Leads with Innovation and Utility #Pepeto takes meme coins further by combining strong branding with real-world use cases.

DOGE meme coin eyes breakout as SEC reviews spot ETF filing Dogecoin (DOGE) is approaching a critical juncture, with technical indicators pointing to a potential 25% breakout. A symmetrical triangle pattern on the 1-hour chart suggests Dogecoin’s price is consolidating, preparing for a significant move. Analysts are closely watching whether Dogecoin surges higher or faces another downturn. According to Crypto Analyst Ali Martinez, the symmetrical triangle signals an impending breakout as Dogecoin’s price squeezes between trendlines. Meanwhile, the SEC has acknowledged Grayscale’s filing for a spot Dogecoin ETF, marking the beginning of its review process. If approved, the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust could bring Dogecoin to mainstream investment markets. The DOGE meme coin trades at $0.26, and analysts expect a rally to $1. Dogecoin is still a top crypto contender with growing institutional interest and technical momentum building. Dogwifhat (WIF) struggles below $1 after 87% drop Dogwifhat (WIF) was among the best cryptos to perform during the last market cycle, advancing 3,000% to an all-time high in March 2024. Dogwifhat was the largest meme coin in the Solana ecosystem and rapidly grew well-known, but it is now not among the top 100 cryptocurrencies. The downturn began in November 2024 and extended into 2025, with Dogwifhat plummeting 87% from its peak. On Feb. 3, 2025, Dogwifhat hit a low of $0.55 and struggled to recover. Currently, Dogwifhat trades at $0.60, sitting below the crucial $1 threshold needed to trigger bullish momentum. Despite its decline, Dogwifhat remains a key player in Solana’s meme coin sector. Analysts suggest that a break back above $1 could reignite investor interest, but until then, Dogwifhat faces an uncertain path in the volatile crypto market. 1Fuel (OFT): Cross-chain trading, AI tools, and exclusive bonuses 1Fuel (OFT) is transforming decentralized trading with its cross-chain compatibility, allowing seamless transactions across multiple blockchains.

However, this bullish dream ended almost immediately after it started as nearly $1.5 billion worth of ETH tokens were drained from the ByBit exchange. Ethereum, which traded as high as $2,840 earlier on Friday, February 21, dropped towards $2,600 on the back of news of the ByBit hack. Interestingly, recent on-chain data suggests that the altcoin’s price could still make its way to $4,000 before the end of this cycle. Could ETH Price Still Record A 60% Rally This Cycle? In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, an analyst with the pseudonym Crypto Sunmoon identified a particular bullish divergence that offers insight into the Ethereum price performance in the near future. This bullish observation is based on recent movements of ETH’s “taker buy/sell ratio” across all exchanges. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price On The Edge: Breakout Or Breakdown—What’s Next? This metric measures the taker buy and taker sell volumes for a specific cryptocurrency (Ethereum, in this case). When the taker buy/sell ratio is greater than one, it implies that the taker buy volume is higher than the taker sell volume. This is typically considered a bullish signal, indicating the willingness of investors to pay a higher price for an asset. On the contrary, a less-than-one taker buy/sell ratio indicates that sellers are overwhelming the buyers in the market. This scenario suggests that more sellers are willing to offload their assets at a lower price, signaling a bearish shift in investor sentiment. Crypto Sunmoon noted that the 100-day exponential moving average (EMA) of the Ethereum taker buy/sell ratio on all exchanges has been rising in recent weeks. The Ethereum price, on the other hand, has been declining since mid-December. According to the analyst, this divergence is positive, as it indicates that a bearish trend has ended and an upward trend could be starting. The last time this bullish divergence occurred, the Ethereum price traveled from beneath $2,500 to above $4,000 (over 60% rally). While investors would view a reclaim of $3,000 as a victory for Ethereum, history and this bullish divergence suggest that the altcoin’s price could still climb toward the $4,000 mark before the end of the current cycle. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Ethereum stands around $2,650, reflecting a nearly 4% decline in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: More Pain Ahead For Solana?

In what he categorized as the ELI5 explainer to non-technical community members, Beiko explained why a rollback is impossible. Historical Trend Behind Chain Rollback The conversations around potential Ethereum rollback followed the $1.4 billion Bybit hack . With over 401,000 ETH siphoned on-chain, top industry leaders are now advocating for a chain halt to reverse the transactions. According to Tim Beiko on X , the rollback trend is not a new trend. He returned to memory lane, noting that they started with Bitcoin in 2010. At the time, a client software minted 184 billion Bitcoins in block 74638. At the time, it was easy for Satoshi Nakamoto to deploy a software patch to address the bug. Also, TheDAO, an Ethereum protocol, suffered a hack in which bad actors siphoned approximately 15% of all ETH it had in custody. Luckily, at the time, there was a fail-safe system where funds withdrawn were frozen for 30 days before access was granted. This allowed the Ethereum developers to rollback the chain, creating a new chain. Tim Beiko noted that the updated chain at the time became Ethereum, while the old chain remained Ethereum Classic. Why is Ethereum Rollback Impossible? In justifying why it is impossible to reverse the transactions on the Ethereum Block that led to the hack, Beiko pointed out the complexity of the current ETH chain. Unlike Bitcoin in 2010, which had limited adoption and a price of $0.07, Ethereum powers real-world economic transactions. The researcher said attempting to roll back the transaction will significantly affect the ecosystem. In addition, he noted that the Lazarus Group behind the hack had moved the Ethereum funds, aligning with earlier reports. Unlike TheDAO, Beiko pointed out the complications in rolling back these transactions. Lastly, he identified the opposition to the rollback of Ethereum in 2018 in a situation related to Parity’s multisig wallet. Despite the over 500,000 Ethereum involved in the case, developers within the ecosystem did not agree to the move. The Ethereum Pectra Upgrade Challenge While Tim Beiko did not highlight this, the protocol is expecting the Pectra upgrade to launch in April. This upgrade, which has been under development for over a year, is set to enter the testing phase in the coming week. Some experts are concerned that the chain rollback plans may also impact the Pectra upgrade. The Ethereum network roadmap is on track; however, industry backlash on the siphoned funds has yet to be resolved.

Ripple (XRP) has long been a key player in cross-border transactions, gaining institutional adoption despite regulatory uncertainties. However, new projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are emerging with strong utility and fresh opportunities, drawing attention from early investors. Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a major force in decentralized finance (DeFi), offering a lending platform where users can supply assets, borrow funds, and earn passive income. Unlike XRP, which is primarily focused on payments, MUTM brings a self-sustaining ecosystem with real financial applications. With over $1 million raised in its presale and Phase 1 nearly sold out, analysts are beginning to view Mutuum Finance as a high-upside opportunity with strong fundamentals backing its long-term growth. Ripple (XRP) XRP has remained a strong contender in the crypto market, largely due to its role in facilitating fast and low-cost cross-border transactions. Its adoption among financial institutions has positioned it as a promising asset, and some analysts believe it could eventually reach $5. However, the timeline for such growth remains uncertain, as XRP’s price movements have been influenced by regulatory challenges and market fluctuations. While its long-term potential is still debated, investors looking for faster returns are exploring alternatives like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which offers a dynamic ecosystem with immediate utility and a structured growth strategy. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly establishing itself as a strong contender in decentralized finance (DeFi), attracting both experienced investors and newcomers seeking high-growth opportunities. Unlike many early-stage projects, Mutuum Finance provides tangible financial utility through its decentralized lending protocol. Users can supply assets to earn passive income or borrow funds while keeping their holdings intact, creating a sustainable economic model that drives continuous demand for the MUTM token. These real-world applications set it apart from speculative tokens and position it for long-term success. The project’s presale has already demonstrated remarkable traction, raising over $1,040,000 in a short time while surpassing 2,200 holders. With more than 97% of Phase 1 tokens sold out, early investors are securing MUTM at $0.01 before the next price increase. Analysts point to this rapid fundraising as a key indicator of growing confidence in the project. As more participants enter the ecosystem and upcoming exchange listings expand accessibility, many believe Mutuum Finance is positioned for exponential growth. Mutuum Finance’s long-term value is further reinforced by its ecosystem utilities, which are designed to create sustained demand and price appreciation. The integration of an overcollateralized stablecoin ensures stability in lending and borrowing, while the buy-and-distribute mechanism continuously supports token demand by using platform revenue to repurchase MUTM from the market. This self-sustaining approach fosters price stability and encourages long-term holding, benefiting both lenders and borrowers. Mutuum Finance’s overcollateralized stablecoin operates on the Ethereum network, maintaining a 1:1 backing with on-chain collateral. This ensures that every minted token is fully secured, allowing users to borrow stable-value assets while keeping their crypto holdings intact. When users lock assets as collateral, they can generate the stablecoin, which is later burned upon loan repayment or liquidation. This process stabilizes supply and demand, offering a transparent and decentralized alternative to traditional stablecoins while improving liquidity within the platform’s lending ecosystem. With a clear roadmap, growing adoption, and strong early-stage momentum, Mutuum Finance is gaining recognition as one of the most promising DeFi projects of 2025. Analysts predict that as adoption increases and the platform scales, MUTM’s value will surge by 4,500%, offering significant upside potential for early investors. Those who recognize its growth potential now have the opportunity to secure a position before the project gains widespread market attention.

XRP – Facilitating Global Financial Transactions XRP continues to be influential in the crypto sphere, especially for its efficiency in handling large-scale, low-cost transactions across borders. Supported by numerous financial institutions, XRP recently gained attention due to speculation about the SEC potentially dropping its lawsuit against Ripple, sparking optimism. As financial infrastructures more fully embrace blockchain, XRP emerges as a top contender among the best crypto coins to buy now, thanks to its practical applications in global finance. Its capability for quick, cost-effective transactions positions it well for expanded use.

Beginning February 17, Jupiter will dedicate 50% of protocol fees to repurchase and lock JUP tokens for three years, bolstering long-term value and stability. With a transparent buyback dashboard, Jupiter is strategically poised for continued growth in the DeFi sector. The current price of JUP is $0.00073409, with the buyback strategy expected to significantly enhance its market value moving forward. Final Words!

XRP remains a top choice for cross-border payments, and Jupiter’s strategic buyback plan positions it as a key player in decentralized exchanges. For investors exploring the best crypto coins to buy now , these assets offer promising avenues for both immediate and long-term growth.

This comes after several recent events suggest a significant change in how the agency handles crypto rules. OpenSea Lawsuit End: New Era for Crypto Oversight? OpenSea has been under investigation since last year when it received a “Wells notice from the SEC. This is a formal warning that the regulatory agency might take legal action. The SEC believed some NFTs on OpenSea could be unregistered securities. This raised questions about how digital collectibles fit into existing laws. Meanwhile, the SEC decided to drop the case against OpenSea shortly after it announced plans to dismiss its lawsuit against Coinbase. These back-to-back decisions suggest the agency is easing its tough approach to crypto, which was what the former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s leadership was known for. Under new leadership, the SEC is changing its strategy. Acting Chairman Mark T. Uyeda has put Commissioner Hester Peirce, a strong supporter of fair crypto rules, in charge of a new unit called the Crypto Task Force. This task force’s role is to work on clearer regulations and communicate directly with crypto companies. OpenSea Victory and the Future of NFT Regulation For OpenSea, the SEC’s decision removes a big legal risk. CEO Devin Finzer criticized the investigation, saying it was unfair to artists and creators. Now that the case is closed, OpenSea can focus on its plans, including the launch of its SEA token airdrop, which will be available to U.S. users. The company hinted at the airdrop after recently introducing its new OS2 platform . Crypto airdrops have always been in a legal gray area. In September, members of Congress asked the SEC to clarify their rules, saying the uncertainty hurts U.S. investors. With the SEC changing its approach, future airdrops and NFT marketplaces may face fewer legal issues. SEC’s Changing Stance on Crypto Cases This is not the first time the SEC has stepped back from a crypto investigation. Last year, it looked into Paxos’ BUSD stablecoin, saying it might be a security, but later dropped the case. The SEC also ended its investigation into Ethereum’s switch to proof-of-stake. Now, with Peirce’s task force working with companies on issues like staking ETFs, the SEC seems more focused on crypto advancements. This marks a shift from its previous strict enforcement approach.

Details,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-ceo-stresses-major-shift-end-of-xrp-case-is-near-details/,"Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently shared his perspective on the SEC’s regulatory stance, suggesting that the agency under its current leadership is moving away from the enforcement-driven policies of the previous administration. Acknowledging the impatience of many within the crypto community, he noted that the SEC appears to be taking a different approach, signaling a potential shift in regulatory strategy. His statement quickly gained traction among XRP supporters and the broader cryptocurrency industry, sparking speculation about the potential resolution of the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit. Many see this as a sign that the prolonged legal battle, which began in December 2020, could be approaching its conclusion. BREAKING: CEO of @Ripple – Brad Garlinghouse says: “This SEC has demonstrated a clear interest in moving on quickly (!) from the failed regulation by enforcement policies of the last Administration.” The End Of The SEC v. RIPPLE Case Is Near! #XRP pic.twitter.com/GrqTukv7OB — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) February 21, 2025 Community Reactions and Speculation The response from the crypto community was immediate. X user JackTheRippler shared Garlinghouse’s statement, emphasizing its significance by framing it as a major development. His post suggested that the SEC is moving from its previous regulatory approach, fueling optimism among XRP enthusiasts. Not everyone was convinced. Kailas Worlds expressed skepticism, questioning why there had been no official dismissal of the lawsuit. He called for “less talk, more action,” reflecting the impatience of many XRP supporters waiting for a resolution for years. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 On the other hand, TraderJoe struck a more optimistic tone. He pointed out that the U.S. crypto market is expanding rapidly and suggested that this regulatory shift could pave the way for greater institutional adoption of XRP. According to him, once the lawsuit is resolved, XRP could see a significant increase in usage and market activity. Implications of a Regulatory Shift Garlinghouse’s remarks imply that the SEC may be re-evaluating its regulatory approach. The enforcement-heavy tactics of the previous administration have faced widespread criticism from industry leaders and policymakers, who argue that such an approach has created uncertainty rather than clarity. If the SEC is indeed adopting a more structured and transparent regulatory framework, this could be a welcome change for blockchain companies operating in the U.S. For Ripple and XRP, the potential shift raises questions about the lawsuit’s future. If the SEC truly intends to “move on quickly,” as Garlinghouse hinted, this could mean an openness to resolving outstanding enforcement actions rather than prolonging them. However, no official confirmation has been provided regarding a resolution, leaving the community in anticipation.

With the market’s constant ebb and flow, it’s easy to miss out on potential goldmines. Let’s dive into two top crypto assets : one that might’ve sailed past you—Near Protocol—and another that’s still docked, waiting for you to hop on board—Qubetics. Near Protocol: The One That Got Away Remember when Bitcoin was just a whisper among tech geeks? Those who got in early are probably lounging on private islands now. Near Protocol had a similar buzz. Launched to tackle scalability issues, it promised faster transactions and lower fees. But if you’re hearing about it now, you might’ve missed the boat. Back in January 2022, Near Protocol hit its all-time high at $20.44. Fast forward to today, and it’s trading around $3.58. That’s a significant drop, but hindsight’s 20/20, right? Analysts had high hopes, predicting it could reach $6.59 by 2025. But the crypto seas are unpredictable, and not all ships sail as expected. So, what happened? The market’s a wild beast. While Near Protocol offered innovative solutions, competition is fierce. Newer platforms emerged, each claiming to be the next big thing. If you didn’t jump on Near Protocol during its peak, you might feel like you missed out. But don’t beat yourself up; the crypto world is full of second chances. Qubetics: Your Ticket to the Next Big Thing Missed out on Near Protocol? Don’t sweat it. Qubetics is here, and it’s making waves. Imagine a world where your online privacy isn’t just a myth. Qubetics offers a decentralized VPN (dVPN) that ensures your data isn’t being hawked to the highest bidder. Traditional VPNs? They’re like using a screen door on a submarine. Centralized and prone to data leaks. Qubetics flips the script with its peer-to-peer network. No central authority means no single point of failure. Whether you’re a journalist dodging censorship or just someone who values their Netflix binge sessions without regional blocks, Qubetics has your back. But wait, there’s more. Qubetics isn’t just about privacy; it’s about opportunity. The crypto presale is in its 22nd stage, and folks are buzzing. Over 484 million tokens sold to more than 20,900 holders, raking in a cool $13.6 million. Right now, $TICS tokens are up for grabs at $0.08073 each. But don’t drag your feet; each stage lasts just seven days, with a 10% price bump every Sunday at midnight. Analysts are whispering sweet nothings about $TICS, predicting it could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale—a juicy 209.67% return on investment. And if the stars align? We might see $1 post-presale and even $15 after the mainnet launch. That’s some serious cheddar. Think about it. An investment of $7,500 today snags you about 92,887 $TICS tokens. If $TICS climbs to $1, you’re looking at $92,887. And if it moonshots to $10? That’s a whopping $928,870. Not too shabby for a day’s work. Interoperability: Bridging the Digital Divide Beyond the dVPN, Qubetics is all about interoperability. In plain English? Making sure different systems play nice together. Picture this: you’re a freelance graphic designer juggling multiple platforms—PayPal, Venmo, crypto wallets. It’s a headache. Qubetics streamlines this mess, allowing seamless transactions across various platforms. Or imagine a business owner dealing with suppliers overseas. Currency conversions, transfer fees, and delays are the norm. With Qubetics, transactions are swift, fees are slashed, and everyone’s happy. It’s like having a universal translator for your financial dealings. Don’t Let This Ship Sail Without You The crypto seas are choppy, and opportunities can slip through your fingers. Near Protocol might’ve been a missed chance, but Qubetics is anchored and ready. With its innovative solutions and a heating up presale, now’s the time to act. Head over to their official site and snag your $TICS tokens before the next price hike. Remember, in the world of crypto, fortune favors the bold. Don’t let this golden opportunity become another “what if.” For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is Qubetics? Qubetics is a decentralized platform offering a VPN service that ensures online privacy through a peer-to-peer network, eliminating centralized control. How can I purchase $TICS tokens? Visit the Qubetics presale page, select your preferred cryptocurrency for payment, enter the desired amount of $TICS tokens, and follow the prompts to complete your purchase. What are the benefits of using Qubetics’ dVPN? Unlike traditional VPNs, Qubetics’ dVPN offers enhanced privacy by operating on a decentralized network, making it resistant to censorship and data breaches. What is interoperability in the context of Qubetics? Interoperability refers to Qubetics’ ability to facilitate seamless transactions across different platforms and systems, simplifying processes for businesses and individuals. Why is there urgency in purchasing $TICS tokens now? The presale is structured in stages, with each stage lasting seven days and a 10% price increase at the end of each stage. Purchasing now secures a lower price before the next hike.

The interaction triggered a $5 billion capital inflow within hours. Binance Coin (BNB) Price Surges 6% amid Kanye West and CZ Chats Binance exchange native coin BNB has been subject to intense market volatility in recent days. Within hours of the Bybit exchange hack , Binance transferred 50,000 ETH to provide emergency support and liquidity for user withdrawals, which successfully helped ease panic and avoid systemic risks. BNB Price Action, Feb 22, 2025 | TradingView BNB price made rapid 6% recovery from Friday’s shock sell-off, as Billionaire rapper and fashion entrepreneur Kanye West, known for his controversial online statements, made enquiries about launching a new crypto project and called Changpeng Zhao’s attention in his latest series of cryptic posts on X (prev. Twitter). Kanye West’s Token Launch Enquiry with CZ Sparks Intense Speculation Kanye West, recognized for his unpredictable ventures in music, fashion, and politics, took to social media on February 22 to discuss cryptocurrency. In a series of posts, he shared screenshots of private messages debating whether to launch his own blockchain rather than simply creating a meme coin. West reposted a message from Mikey Shelton stating, “You are the brand. Whatever it is will do well. Some things are better than others. It’s about who you trust.” This suggested that West is considering a serious blockchain project rather than jumping onto meme coin trends. Another post showed a conversation with Edward, who advised him: “Using Cardano as an example, they had the Cardano token, a wallet system, a whitepaper, a roadmap website, etc. You could set up a similar structure.” Kanye West inquires about BNB | Feb 22, 2025 | Source: X.com/Kanyewest Adding to the speculation, Kanye recently followed Changpeng Zhao on X, making CZ the only person he follows. CZ responded humorously, posting: “DEX is so much harder to use…” further fueling rumors of a collaboration. West’s interest comes amid a growing wave of celebrity-driven crypto projects. In recent years, figures like Iggy Azalea, Caitlyn Jenner, and former NBA stars have launched their own tokens, with mixed results. BNB Price Forecast: $700 Breakout Imminent if CZ Talks with Ye Advance Further BNB price forecast chart suggests strong upside momentum, consolidating above key technical levels. The 12-hour chart shows BNB trading at $669.5, gaining 3.41% on the session. BNB Price Forecast | BNBUSD Bollinger Bands Expansion: The price is pressing against the upper band at $689.8, signaling increasing bullish pressure. A breakout above this level could propel BNB toward $700, particularly if discussions between Kanye and CZ sparks more speculative demand. Volume Delta Surge: Buying volume is outpacing selling pressure. A significant 24.48K increase in volume on the latest green candle aligns with a 5.35% price gain, indicating strong market participation. On-Balance Volume (OBV) Trend: OBV has flipped positive, confirming accumulation. Historically, such a shift precedes sustained rallies, making a retest of $700 likely. A rejection at $689.8 could trigger a short-term pullback to the middle Bollinger Band at $663.1, while the lower band at $636.5 serves as the last line of defense against a broader correction. For BNB to sustain its uptrend, it must establish firm support above $680. A failure to hold this level could invalidate the bullish outlook, leading to increased volatility.

TIA price has climbed 3.80% in the last 24 hours, but it’s still down 83.15% from a year ago. The market sentiment remains bearish, and Celestia is trading below key resistance levels. Meanwhile, FTX token is up 15% in a week as excitement builds around the exchange’s repayment plan, set to begin on February 18. Short-term momentum looks strong, but long-term uncertainty remains. While some tokens are struggling, BlockDAG is growing fast. Its TG Tap Miner now has over 200,000 users, proving to be one of the hottest play-to-earn opportunities. With BDAG projected to hit $1 in 2025, this free mining game is fueling the entire ecosystem, making BlockDAG a top crypto to buy in 2025. BlockDAG’s TG Tap Miner Crosses 200K Users—Why It’s a Game-Changer Mining crypto doesn’t have to be complicated, and BlockDAG’s TG Tap Miner proves it. With over 200,000 users, this Telegram-based game makes earning BDAG as easy as tapping a screen. Each session lets players earn Tap Points, which will convert into BDAG when the blockchain goes live. As BDAG’s price is projected to hit $1 in 2025, early participants are stacking up potential future rewards. The ease of use and growing adoption make BlockDAG’s ecosystem one of the most exciting developments in the space. The BlockDAG presale is another sign of its momentum, with over $197 million raised so far. BDAG is currently priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27, with 18.4 billion coins sold. With plans to list on 10+ major exchanges, the project is attracting serious attention. The presale’s rapid growth shows why many are considering BlockDAG a top crypto to buy in 2025, offering a chance to get in before the price surges. With both the TG Tap Miner and presale driving adoption, BlockDAG is building a strong foundation. The X1 Miner app has already surpassed 500,000 active users, adding to the network’s reach. As the launch approaches, BlockDAG continues to stand out as a top crypto to buy in 2025. Is a Rebound Coming? Latest TIA Price Update The TIA price has gained 3.80% in the last 24 hours, showing some short-term recovery, but the overall trend remains bearish. It is still down 35.92% in the past month and 83.15% over the past year, trading at $3.18. With key resistance at $3.10, $3.17, and $3.23, TIA needs a strong push to break higher. Analysts predict a possible jump to $3.99 by February 22, which would be a 29.66% increase, but sentiment remains weak, with 22 indicators bearish and only 4 bullish. Celestia hit an all-time high of $20.85 in February 2024, making the current TIA price a steep decline from its peak. Technical indicators show mixed signals, with some suggesting further downside. With market uncertainty still in play, breaking past resistance levels will be key for a potential recovery. Can the FTX Token Keep Climbing as Repayments Begin? The FTX token has jumped 15% in the past week, currently trading at $2.2172 after a 2.13% gain in the last 24 hours. The price surge comes as FTX prepares to start creditor repayments on February 18. Wallets with claims under $50,000 will reportedly receive 118% of their owed USD value within three business days. With this repayment plan in motion, speculation is building around whether FTT can push past key resistance levels at $2.8360 and $3.50. Despite recent gains, uncertainty remains. The 50/200-day EMA just recorded a Death Cross, a bearish signal that hints at potential downside. If FTX token breaks below $2.2050, it could fall toward $1.58. On the other hand, if bullish sentiment holds, analysts suggest a possible FTT rally to $5.50 this year, making the next few weeks critical for its direction. Summing Up TIA price is up 3.80% today but still struggling to recover from its 83.15% drop over the past year. Analysts predict a possible move to $3.99, but with sentiment still bearish, breaking resistance will be a challenge. Meanwhile, FTX token has surged 15% in a week, fueled by the exchange’s repayment plan starting February 18. With small creditors set to receive 118% of their claims, FTT is seeing renewed interest, though technical indicators remain mixed. While these tokens face uncertainty, BlockDAG is proving to be a top crypto to buy in 2025. With over 200,000 users tapping to earn BDAG and its presale surpassing $197 million, the ecosystem is expanding fast.

According to analysts at JPMorgan, there’s been a notable decline in institutional interest in the crypto industry, particularly through Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts. Institutional Demand Declines, Futures Market Signals Weakness Institutional investors have been a major primer for Bitcoin’s price rallies in the past year and they have been influential in Bitcoin’s break above the $100,000 mark. However, since breaking above this level, the Bitcoin price has failed to push further, which is a sign of a slowdown in institutional investments. Related Reading: Bitcoin Ready For ‘Take Off’—Analyst Reveals Key Signals This slowdown in institutional investments was confirmed by analysts at JPMorgan in a recent note to clients. One of the most pressing revelations from JPMorgan’s analysis is the apparent decline in the Bitcoin and Ethereum futures markets on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The bank’s research highlights a growing trend of backwardation, a scenario in which spot prices exceed futures prices. Typically, a healthy market sees futures contracts priced higher than the spot price due to the expectation of future growth. However, the current inversion suggests that institutional players remain hesitant, likely due to a lack of immediate bullish catalysts. “This is a negative development and indicative of demand weakness,” JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note to clients. “Lower demand from systematic and momentum-driven funds, such as CTAs, has also affected bitcoin and ether futures,” he added. Speaking of bullish catalysts, there has been a major slowdown in the euphoria surrounding crypto-positive developments from the new Trump administration in the US. Any supportive policies or regulatory reforms for the crypto industry are unlikely to take effect until the latter half of 2025. As such, Bitcoin and the rest of the market are currently stuck in limbo without any bullish catalysts and continued profit-taking. Allegations Of Market Manipulation Beyond the shifts in institutional sentiment, suspicions of artificial market suppression have gained traction within the crypto community. Industry leaders, including Samson Mow, CEO of Jan3, have voiced concerns that Bitcoin’s inability to gain sustained upward momentum above $100,000 appears “manufactured.” According to him, some large market participants are selling even as retail buyers are dollar-cost averaging and buying. These allegations are not new, as Bitcoin’s history has been punctuated by periods of suspected price manipulation by whales. The recent influx of more institutional investors even makes this price manipulation more possible than in the previous cycles.

Given the current trend, Bitcoin might continue consolidating around $100,000 in the short term, at least until the second half of 2025. However, long-term price targets from analysts for Bitcoin range from between $150,000 to $2 million.

Tokens under $1 often combine strong fundamentals with significant adoption potential, making them an appealing choice. With 2025 expected to be a pivotal year for digital assets, the top 4 altcoins under $1 are gaining momentum. Some of these projects are already making waves with key ecosystem upgrades, while others are leading the charge in Web3, payments, and blockchain innovation. For those seeking value and potential, these altcoins stand out as options worth considering. 1. Web3Bay – Reshaping E-Commerce with Blockchain Web3Bay is redefining online shopping by eliminating intermediaries and giving users full control over transactions. This decentralized marketplace allows buyers and sellers to interact seamlessly using crypto, with its native token, 3BAY, facilitating payments, rewards, and governance. Currently priced at $0.004562625, Web3Bay’s presale has raised over $1.5 million, with more than 375 million tokens sold. The structured presale model increases the token price by 15% per stage, setting the foundation for its launch price of $0.1959. Web3Bay goes beyond traditional e-commerce by integrating blockchain for secure, fee-free transactions while offering governance rights through a DAO. The roadmap for 2025 includes the expansion of crypto payment options, NFT-based commerce, and a transition to full decentralization. As one of the top 4 altcoins under $1 , Web3Bay stands out with practical utility and long-term growth prospects. 2. Cardano (ADA) – A Research-Backed Blockchain for the Future Cardano has built its reputation on a methodical and research-driven approach to blockchain development. Trading at $0.772737, ADA remains an attractive asset for investors looking for long-term blockchain projects with sustainability and scalability in mind. The network continues rolling out upgrades, with a focus on smart contracts, decentralized applications, and institutional adoption. Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, has expressed confidence in ADA’s potential, comparing its trajectory to that of Ethereum and XRP. The 2025 roadmap includes further decentralization, increased DeFi integrations, and expanding real-world applications. As one of the top 4 altcoins under $1 , Cardano’s measured, long-term approach positions it as a strong contender in blockchain development. 3. Stellar (XLM) – Enabling Fast, Global Transactions Stellar remains a dominant player in blockchain-based financial services, offering near-instant and low-cost cross-border transactions. With XLM trading at $0.345041, it provides an accessible entry point for those looking to invest in scalable blockchain infrastructure. Stellar’s ability to process transactions within 3 to 5 seconds, coupled with minimal fees, has positioned it as a preferred choice for businesses and individuals seeking efficient payment solutions. The network continues to expand its partnerships with fintech firms and financial institutions, reinforcing its real-world use cases. As adoption increases, Stellar’s role in the digital finance space strengthens. Among the top 4 altcoins under $1 , Stellar remains a strong option for those who see blockchain as a disruptor to traditional financial systems. 4. Tron (TRX) – Growing Its Role in DeFi Tron has steadily gained recognition for its expanding footprint in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. Currently priced at $0.242291, TRX has recorded a 2.65% gain recently, signaling resilience amid market fluctuations. With its blockchain optimized for speed and low fees, Tron is becoming an increasingly attractive platform for DeFi applications and entertainment-based blockchain services. Beyond its technical capabilities, Tron’s presence in the DeFi space continues to grow. It is frequently cited as a small-cap asset with the potential for significant returns under favorable market conditions. If the DeFi ecosystem expands further, Tron’s utility and adoption could increase, supporting its price growth. With these factors in play, TRX solidifies its position among the top 4 altcoins under $1 as a promising player in the evolving blockchain landscape. Key Highlights! Finding undervalued cryptocurrencies with high potential goes beyond just looking at low prices—it’s about identifying projects with strong fundamentals and meaningful use cases. The top 4 altcoins under $1 listed here bring distinct value propositions, whether through Web3Bay’s decentralized e-commerce model, Stellar’s rapid transaction capabilities, Cardano’s research-driven framework, or Tron’s growing role in DeFi. Each of these projects is positioned for significant developments in 2025. Web3Bay’s presale momentum is growing, while Tron continues expanding its DeFi applications. Meanwhile, Cardano and Stellar remain focused on scaling their ecosystems. With these four cryptos in focus, there’s plenty of room for growth as blockchain adoption accelerates.

In an interview with Rob Nelson on Roundtable, Boiron explained that Bitcoin scarcity and growing demand will drive the surge of the token’s price. He said: You’ve got this one asset that has this fixed supply, and all you need to figure out is whether demand is going to increase for this asset or not. It’s literally that simple. Marc Boiron Boiron has high expectations for Bitcoin, claiming the token poses less of a threat to investors in the current market state The CEO argued that Bitcoin is the easiest financial asset to figure out, yet most people don’t understand this concept. He even believes the asset could trade as high as $250,000 in the year, adding that Bitcoin will rise as demand for it grows and supply remains the same. He even pointed to the token’s scarcity as a reason for its potential growth. Moreover, he stated that, given the current market, Bitcoin has less downside risk despite the token’s history of price volatility. Boiron stated that with upcoming regulations, he can see that Bitcoin will pose less of a risk to investors than it typically does. Bitcoin dropped to less than $97,000 on Friday after the Bybit hack Crypto prices dipped on Friday after hackers drained almost $1.5 billion from crypto exchange Bybit. According to security analysts, North Korea’s Lazarus group was responsible for the attack. However, these analysts are overly concerned about the group’s advanced techniques, seeing how they pulled the largest attack in crypto history. Bitcoin fell to less than $97,000, down from close to $100,000 after the attack. Currently, the asset is trading at only $96,581, though it represents a 1.36% rise in the last 24 hours. Ether also slipped by nearly 4%, trading below $2.700. However, the coin is doing so much better now, showing a 5% rise in the last 24 hours to $2,774 . On Friday, Coinglass also reported they were over $500 million in liquidations.

At the same time, Shiba Inu coin has seen its burn rate soar by 2,000%, reducing supply and driving speculation about future prices. While these moves grab attention, a bigger shift might be unfolding in Web3 e-commerce. Web3Bay is reshaping the Shopify model by removing middlemen and fees. This blockchain-powered marketplace gives sellers full control over their stores. With a fast-moving presale, those who act early could join a major shift in online selling. Web3Bay Disrupts E-Commerce: No Middlemen, No Extra Charges! Shopify made it simple for anyone to start an online store, but Web3Bay is going further by cutting out platform fees and third parties. Sellers on Web3Bay maintain complete control without depending on banks, payment processors, or centralized platforms that charge high fees. Transactions happen directly on the blockchain, ensuring lower costs, faster payments, and no risk of frozen funds. This is a game changer for small businesses struggling with hidden fees on platforms like Shopify. Web3Bay is already gaining attention. Its presale has raised over $1.5 million, with the 3BAY token priced at $0.004562625 in the current stage. The price increases by 15% at each stage, offering growth potential for those who get in early. At launch, 3BAY is expected to reach $0.1959, making it one of the most promising presales right now. LTC crypto has shown how decentralized finance is reshaping industries, and Web3Bay is bringing the same approach to online shopping. Sellers connect directly with customers, eliminating platform interference, while buyers enjoy lower prices. As Web3 commerce grows, Web3Bay is positioning itself as a leading platform that could challenge traditional e-commerce giants. Litecoin Eyes ETF Approval as Price Momentum Builds Litecoin is gaining attention as talks of spot ETF approval gain steam. Bloomberg analysts estimate a 90% chance that the SEC will approve Litecoin’s ETF this year, which could attract more traditional traders. With Bitcoin paving the way for crypto ETFs, Litecoin’s solid track record and growing institutional adoption could push its price higher. Recent trends also suggest bullish momentum. Litecoin’s price has climbed 24.3% in the past week, outperforming the broader crypto market’s 5% growth. GameStop’s reported interest in crypto assets, including Litecoin, adds to the excitement. If ETF approval happens, Litecoin could see a surge in demand, making it a coin to watch in 2025. Shiba Inu Coin’s Burn Rate Surges 2,000% as Whale Activity Rises Shiba Inu coin is showing strong on-chain activity, with its burn rate jumping over 2,000% in the past 24 hours. More than 14 million SHIB tokens have been taken out of circulation, increasing speculation about future price movements. Reducing supply has always been key to SHIB’s price potential. Recent large withdrawals by whale wallets—such as the 85.5 billion SHIB moved from Coinbase—suggest growing interest. Unlike Litecoin, which is focused on mainstream adoption through ETFs, Shiba Inu aims to build a long-term ecosystem. Lead developer Shytoshi Kusama has shared an ambitious plan to make SHIB a global player by 2030. With rising burns, whale interest, and strategic growth, SHIB could be gearing up for a significant move. Summing Up! Litecoin could experience a major shift if ETF approval boosts demand from traditional traders. Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu coin is gaining traction with its 2,000% burn rate spike and whale transactions tightening supply, which could affect future prices. Both coins are attracting attention for different reasons. However, Web3 e-commerce is emerging as another major force, with Web3Bay leading the way. With its presale surpassing $1.5 million, Web3Bay offers an alternative to Shopify by giving sellers full control and removing platform fees. As traditional platforms continue to charge high fees, Web3Bay’s model could be the breakthrough that small businesses need as e-commerce evolves.

While Bitcoin (BTC) enjoys a well-deserved surge, whispers are circulating about another cryptocurrency poised to benefit even more significantly. FloppyPepe (FPPE) , an AI-powered meme token, is being tipped for the largest gains. Hence, the question is, why is FloppyPepe (FPPE) attracting so much attention in the wake of the BlackRock massive Bitcoin (BTC) buy-in? BlackRock Go Big On Bitcoin (BTC) With $127M Investment On February 16, BlackRock bought $127 million of Bitcoin (BTC). While BlackRock is known for its large investments, its purchases often show their faith in the token’s growth. However, an analyst has said their recent investment in Bitcoin (BTC) will take an unexpected turn. Crypto veterans expect Bitcoin (BTC) to surge but believe an AI-powered meme token will benefit the most from this transaction. Their rationale is that the combination of this token’s AI feature and its Real-world asset (RWA) attribute will make it a lifeline investment . FloppyPepe (FPPE): A High-Growth AI-powered Meme Token in a Bitcoin-Influenced Market The recent Bitcoin (BTC) surge, triggered by BlackRock’s $127 million investment, dominates news headlines, but seasoned investors pay attention to other developments. FloppyPepe (FPPE) emerged quickly into the spotlight as an AI-powered meme token with significant growth opportunities. Market analysts suggest that this AI-driven coin stands out due to its ability to capitalize on Bitcoin’s (BTC) rising power to draw in both meme enthusiasts and investors seeking quick profits. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is distinct from traditional meme coins because it incorporates AI-driven utilities to strengthen its sustainability. Its AI video agent delivers immediate market analysis for investors to make better decisions. Users will have the opportunity to earn revenue from AI-produced images through a forthcoming text-to-image feature on its Telegram channel. This inventive approach allows FloppyPepe (FPPE) to tap into rapidly expanding areas of the cryptocurrency market. Through its strategic tokenomics model, the FloppyPepe (FPPE) AI-powered Meme token offers more than technology. Through a 3% transaction redistribution system, current holders can earn passive income alongside the benefits of stability and scarcity. By implementing a deflationary burn mechanism, the platform increases asset value and creates opportunities for significant profit growth with rising demand. FloppyPepe (FPPE) prioritizes security and credibility within its fundamental objectives. As such, the network completed a smart contract audit by SolidProof to strengthen its transparency against possible exploits. The project spends a fraction of its revenue on wildlife preservation while showing dedication to improving investor portfolios and creating worldwide change. These elements have improved market trust in this AI-powered meme token. At its current price of $0.0000002 , FloppyPepe (FPPE) presents investors with affordability and profitable potential. Top YouTube crypto influencer NASS Crypto joins market veterans and analysts who support FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) future success. Bitcoin (BTC) leads institutional adoption, but major percentage gains might emerge from AI-powered meme tokens like FloppyPepe (FPPE). This AI-based meme coin stands ready to surpass Bitcoin (BTC) instead of merely following its momentum. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Gains Traction After BlackRock’s Buy-in Bitcoin (BTC) remains the leading cryptocurrency in the world, and BlackRock remains at the top of influential whale networks. Hence, the recent BlackRock investment in Bitcoin (BTC) has strengthened market trust. The most eye-catching aspect of this development is how this move affects altcoins like FloppyPepe (FPPE) . Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent rise demonstrates its established market position, while FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) expected profits demonstrate how the crypto market continues to evolve dynamically. Due to its mix of meme coin characteristics and AI functionalities, this AI-powered meme token benefits from growing interest in intelligent, community-focused projects. While it is uncertain if FloppyPepe (FPPE) will outperform Bitcoin’s (BTC) gains, its rapid growth rate shows it is the most prospective token in the 2025 market. Its affordable entry point makes it an attractive asset for a prosperous crypto market.

Toncoin is hovering near $4 as whale investors pour in $250 million, signaling a possible breakout. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu price is struggling around $0.000016, with whale transactions down 88%, adding pressure on support levels. While these assets fight for momentum, one project is flipping the script with a new way to engage in crypto. BlockDAG just made crypto buying more exciting with its Achievements Page, where users earn XP, complete missions, and level up for exclusive perks. Every action—buying BDAG, referring friends, or engaging with the platform—pushes you higher on the leaderboard. The best crypto to buy now isn’t just about gains; it’s about unlocking power-ups before others do. BlockDAG Turns Crypto Buying Into a Rewards Game BlockDAG has introduced a new Achievements Page, turning every transaction into a chance to earn XP, unlock perks, and climb the leaderboard.

The best crypto to buy now isn’t just about price—it’s about seizing every advantage before the next surge. Whales Drive Big Moves as Toncoin Price Eyes Key Levels Toncoin price is hovering near $4, consolidating after a $250 million whale accumulation over three days. Large investors picked up 68 million TON tokens, signaling confidence in its long-term potential. However, the market is at a crossroads, with low volatility and a tight trading range between $3.70 and $3.90. Technical indicators show mixed signals—while the Money Flow Index (MFI) at 16.79 suggests oversold conditions, the Parabolic SAR remains bearish. If TON breaks past $4.50, a trend reversal could take shape. On-chain data shows diverging trends among holders. Addresses holding 1-100 TON are up 32%, but daily active addresses have dropped 45% since last August, when Toncoin price peaked at $7.50. The market is waiting for a decisive move—whale interest suggests strength, but clearing resistance at $4.50 and $4.79 will be the real test. Whale Exit Signals Pressure as Shiba Inu Price Fights to Hold Support Shiba Inu price has been stuck near $0.000016 for the past two weeks, with whale transactions dropping 88% in that time. On-chain data shows a sharp decline in large-scale activity, with the average transaction size falling from $39,000 to just $4,707. This signals hesitation among big holders, increasing the risk of a drop below $0.000015. Technical indicators also point to uncertainty—the RSI hovers at 40.73, showing weak buying momentum, while the 50-day EMA at $0.00001682 and the 100-day EMA at $0.00001889 remain key resistance levels. Despite the slowdown, some signs suggest a potential reversal. If Shiba Inu price stabilizes and whale activity picks up, a move toward $0.000018 could follow. The meme coin sector is still strong after the DOGE ETF acknowledgment, and renewed hype could bring SHIB back into an uptrend—but bulls need to step in soon. Summing Up Toncoin price is at a critical point, consolidating around $4 while whales accumulate $250 million worth of TON. If it clears $4.50, a breakout could follow, but weak network activity raises concerns. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu price struggles at $0.000016, with whale transactions dropping 88%, increasing risks of a dip below $0.000015 unless buying pressure returns. While TON and SHIB battle resistance, BlockDAG is bringing a new way to engage with crypto. Its Achievements Page turns every action—buying BDAG, referring friends, and platform engagement—into XP and exclusive perks. The best crypto to buy now isn’t just about holding—it’s about leveling up before others do. As BDAG heads toward major CEX listings, those racking up XP now will be first in line for rewards.

Polkadot (DOT) and Hedera (HBAR) are both experiencing key market movements, with DOT pushing past resistance levels and HBAR approaching a potential reversal zone. But while these assets navigate price surges and corrections, Web3Bay is taking decentralization to a new frontier—e-commerce. Much like OpenSea revolutionized NFTs, Web3Bay eliminates intermediaries, giving users full control over online transactions. With a successful presale and rising adoption, Web3Bay presents a first-mover advantage in reshaping digital commerce. Web3Bay Drives the Shift Toward User-Owned E-Commerce Web3Bay isn’t just tweaking existing models—it’s flipping the entire e-commerce structure by prioritizing ownership and decentralization. Traditional platforms like Amazon and eBay act as intermediaries, collecting high fees and controlling transactions. Web3Bay removes these barriers, allowing merchants to retain full control over their stores and profits. Much like how OpenSea transformed NFT trading, Web3Bay is setting the stage for a decentralized marketplace, where sellers operate independently without interference from corporate platforms. Adoption is gaining speed. With over 375 million coins sold and a presale surpassing $1.5 million, Web3Bay is attracting both investors and early adopters. Currently in Stage 4, the presale price has risen to $0.004562625, reflecting increasing demand and confidence in its long-term impact. By integrating smart contracts for secure, transparent transactions, Web3Bay minimizes risks and reduces the fees that have long been a burden on sellers. As decentralization gains traction, Web3Bay presents an alternative to corporate-controlled online markets, offering users an efficient and community-driven commerce solution. Hedera (HBAR) Approaches Key Resistance—Will It Break Through? Hedera (HBAR) is holding ground at $0.228258, reflecting a minor 0.02196% dip from its last close. Intraday movement saw prices fluctuate between $0.239214 and $0.227705, placing HBAR at a key decision point. Looking at broader market patterns, HBAR appears to be finalizing a corrective Wave 4 within its Elliott Wave cycle, having recently tested the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.218. Historically, this range has acted as strong support, suggesting a potential reversal is forming. Technical indicators reinforce this view. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has entered oversold territory, a typical precursor to bullish momentum. Additionally, a descending wedge breakout on the 1-hour chart suggests an imminent upward push. If the current support holds, the next target sits at $0.31, with further resistance at $0.35 and $0.39. However, if HBAR falls below $0.218, traders may see a downward move toward critical support at $0.177. Polkadot (DOT) Surges—Is $10 the Next Stop? Polkadot (DOT) is breaking barriers, pushing past key resistance levels and showing strong bullish momentum. Analysts highlight DOT’s decisive breakout above $7.30, a historically challenging price zone. The move is backed by increasing trading volume and positive on-chain data, signaling growing investor confidence. If this momentum sustains, DOT could reach $8.50 next, with a stronger push toward $10 possible if buying pressure remains. Supporting this outlook, technical indicators such as the RSI and Moving Averages confirm increasing demand, positioning DOT for further gains. Beyond price action, Polkadot’s expanding ecosystem is adding to its strength. Parachain adoption and rising staking participation continue to reinforce its market standing. Still, traders remain cautious of potential market shifts, making $7.00 a key support level to watch. If DOT maintains its current trajectory, further bullish movement seems likely in the coming weeks. Final Thoughts As Polkadot (DOT) breaks through resistance and Hedera (HBAR) hovers near key reversal levels, both highlight the increasing demand for decentralized solutions in the market. However, Web3Bay is approaching decentralization from a different angle—one that could impact real-world commerce on a broader scale. Unlike traditional e-commerce platforms that dictate fees and policies, Web3Bay ensures direct transactions between buyers and sellers. Much like OpenSea changed how NFTs are bought and sold, Web3Bay is shaping the next phase of online trade. With a successful presale and strong adoption trends, it’s not just another blockchain project—it’s a potential game-changer for digital commerce.

With new projects emerging regularly, many crypto enthusiasts are always on the lookout for the next big thing. As we gear up for the next bull run crypto , it’s clear that certain digital assets are primed to dominate the scene. Among them, Qubetics, Ethereum, and Chainlink are making waves in the blockchain industry, each with its unique features and groundbreaking advancements. So, if you’re looking to understand how these players are setting the stage for the future of digital finance, this comparative article will break it down. Ethereum, widely recognized as the pioneer of smart contracts, has been a cornerstone of decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi). The Ethereum network continues to evolve with new improvements, including the transition to Ethereum 2.0, which focuses on scalability, security, and energy efficiency. This shift is expected to propel Ethereum further into the spotlight, and many are betting that it will play a significant role in the upcoming bull run crypto cycle. Meanwhile, Chainlink, the oracle network connecting smart contracts to real-world data, is another vital player in the crypto space. As decentralized applications rely heavily on accurate external data, Chainlink’s integration with various blockchain platforms has positioned it as an essential infrastructure for the entire DeFi ecosystem. With its growing adoption, Chainlink’s impact is only set to grow as we approach the next bull run crypto. But there’s another rising star in the crypto universe that is worth talking about: Qubetics . This innovative project is making waves with its next-gen, non-custodial multi-chain wallet, designed to streamline transactions across different blockchains while ensuring top-notch security. Through its partnerships with 1inch and SWFT, Qubetics is shaping up to be a significant player in the future of blockchain and digital finance. So, how does it compare to the likes of Ethereum and Chainlink? Let’s dive into each of these projects and see what sets them apart. Qubetics: A Game-Changer in Blockchain with Revolutionary Wallet Solutions When we talk about the next bull run crypto, it’s essential to highlight emerging projects that are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. One such project is Qubetics, which is swiftly gaining attention in the crypto community, and for a good reason. With its non-custodial multi-chain wallet, Qubetics is reshaping how users interact with the blockchain. First off, the Qubetics Wallet offers a seamless cross-chain experience, making it easier for users to perform transactions across different blockchain networks. This multi-chain compatibility is essential as the crypto world grows increasingly complex, with various networks and tokens coexisting. But it doesn’t stop there—Qubetics has also partnered with industry leaders like 1inch and SWFT to optimize trading and enhance security. Qubetics’ partnership with SWFT Blockchain introduces a wallet that redefines user expectations. This collaboration focuses on offering lightning-fast transactions and a level of cross-chain functionality that has never been seen before. With SWFT’s cutting-edge technology, users can easily swap assets and manage their portfolios across different blockchains. Security is a top priority, and the Qubetics Wallet boasts advanced encryption to protect users’ funds, making it one of the most secure options available. Moreover, the integration with 1inch further elevates the Qubetics Wallet. 1inch’s DeFi aggregation technology allows users to trade across hundreds of decentralized exchanges, ensuring optimized prices and unmatched liquidity. This means that Qubetics users will benefit from efficient trading with the best possible rates, regardless of market conditions. As the presale for Qubetics continues to gain momentum, analysts are predicting significant returns. The project has already sold over 484 million tokens to more than 20,900 holders, raising over $13.6 million. With the presale entering its 22nd stage, the price of $TICS tokens stands at $0.08073, and experts predict returns as high as 11,380% after the mainnet launch. The Qubetics presale offers an exciting opportunity, but it won’t last forever. In essence, Qubetics is more than just a wallet—it’s a comprehensive solution for anyone involved in decentralized finance, whether you’re an investor, business, or professional. By offering an intuitive user experience and powerful features, Qubetics is perfectly positioned to play a major role in the next bull run crypto. Ethereum: The Blockchain Giant Leading the Way in Smart Contracts Ethereum has long been a foundational element in the world of cryptocurrency, and as we approach the next bull run crypto, its importance remains undeniable. As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum’s blockchain is the go-to platform for smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The Ethereum network’s primary selling point is its ability to execute smart contracts—self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code. This has opened the door for decentralized applications to thrive, and it’s no surprise that Ethereum has become the backbone of the DeFi revolution. Developers and innovators flock to Ethereum for its reliability and scalability, making it an essential player in the next bull run crypto cycle. With the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, Ethereum aims to address its scalability issues and transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). This shift is expected to reduce energy consumption significantly while improving transaction speeds and lowering costs. Ethereum’s move to PoS will also reward holders of ETH with staking rewards, further driving interest in the ecosystem. Despite its dominance, Ethereum does face competition from newer blockchain platforms such as Solana and Avalanche, which offer faster and cheaper transactions. However, Ethereum’s extensive ecosystem, developer support, and ongoing upgrades ensure that it will continue to be a major player in the next bull run crypto. Chainlink: The Oracle Network Powering DeFi Chainlink is another blockchain project that is perfectly positioned for the next bull run crypto. Unlike Ethereum, which is focused on smart contracts and dApps, Chainlink’s main function is to provide reliable, tamper-proof data to smart contracts. Known as an oracle network, Chainlink acts as a bridge between the blockchain and real-world data, enabling smart contracts to interact with external systems, such as price feeds, weather data, and other APIs. Chainlink’s ability to provide accurate and secure data is crucial for the success of decentralized finance applications, which rely on real-time data for their operations. By connecting blockchains to the off-chain world, Chainlink makes it possible for decentralized applications to operate more efficiently and securely. Over the years, Chainlink has integrated with various blockchains and DeFi protocols, establishing itself as the go-to oracle solution for developers. As the DeFi ecosystem grows, Chainlink’s importance will only increase, making it a prime candidate for the next bull run crypto. The Power of the Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, Partnership with 1inch and SWFT As we’ve discussed, Qubetics’ non-custodial multi-chain wallet, in partnership with 1inch and SWFT, is set to reshape how users interact with the blockchain. This wallet is designed to address the challenges of managing assets across multiple blockchains, offering seamless trading, enhanced security, and a user-friendly interface. Whether you’re an investor, business owner, or crypto enthusiast, the Qubetics Wallet is designed to make your blockchain experience smoother, safer, and more efficient. With SWFT Blockchain’s advanced technology and 1inch’s liquidity aggregation, Qubetics is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the crypto space. Users can trade assets across multiple decentralized exchanges with optimized pricing, making it easier to maximize profits. Additionally, the non-custodial nature of the wallet ensures that users maintain full control over their assets, providing a sense of security and ownership that’s essential in today’s digital finance world. Conclusion: As we approach the next bull run crypto, it’s clear that Ethereum, Chainlink, and Qubetics are all playing pivotal roles in shaping the future of blockchain and digital finance. While Ethereum continues to lead the way with its smart contract capabilities, and Chainlink’s oracles provide critical data for decentralized applications, Qubetics is offering innovative solutions that address real-world issues with its cutting-edge wallet technology. The Qubetics crypto presale is an exciting opportunity for those looking to get involved in a project that’s poised to make a significant impact in the crypto space. With a strong community, strategic partnerships, and a forward-thinking approach, Qubetics has the potential to generate significant returns in the next bull run crypto. So, don’t miss out—now is the time to get involved in the future of digital finance.

However, the price now seems to be moving toward a retest of the ascending trendline support. This decline is driven by bearish market sentiment and the recent heist experienced by Bybit. Cardano (ADA) Current Momentum As the ADA price nears the support level, it becomes crucial to see whether the asset will hold this level. If the market does not experience a massive sell-off, the price may stabilize. However, if selling pressure increases, the market will likely continue this trend until sentiment shifts. ADA Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, ADA still holds its upside potential as long as it trades above the ascending trendline or the $0.73 mark. Looking at the daily and four-hour time frames, ADA appears to be forming a bullish cup-and-handle pattern along with an ascending triangle pattern, reinforcing its bullish outlook. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, ADA could soon hit the $0.85 level once it crosses the $0.78 mark. However, given the current market sentiment, if ADA falls and closes a four-hour candle below the $0.74 level, we could witness a heavy sell-off and a notable 10% price drop, bringing it down to the $0.65 level. As of now, the asset is trading below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the four-hour time frame, indicating that it is still in a downtrend. Meanwhile, its Average Directional Index (ADX) stands at 12, suggesting weak trend strength, which could be a key reason why ADA has failed to rally. Current Price Momentum and Over-Leveraged Levels Looking at the current market sentiment, intraday traders are over-leveraged at the $0.76 level on the long side, with $2.23 million worth of long positions. Meanwhile, the $0.785 level is another over-leveraged zone where traders betting on the short side have built $2 million worth of short positions. Source: Coinglass Examining these over-leveraged positions, it appears that bulls are dominating, which could help ADA’s price stay above the crucial trendline. ADA is currently trading near $0.77 and has experienced a modest 0.50% price surge in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume dropped by 50%, indicating fear among traders and investors, leading to lower participation compared to the previous day.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ADA|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-23 02:55:59
40711513,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=701324,1740279623,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/40711513.jpeg,Crypto CEO Calls Start Of The Altcoin Season With A Caveat,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/crypto-ceo-calls-start-of-the-altcoin-season-with-a-caveat/,"According to CryptoQuant’s data, the long-awaited altcoin season may have officially arrived. The CEO of the crypto market company, Ki Young Ju, has pointed out a significant surge in altcoin volume on Centralised Exchanges (CEXs). Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Tightens — CZ Says There’s ‘No Escape’ From Crypto CryptoQuant CEO Says Altcoin Season Has Begun Presenting a detailed price chart of the volume ratio of Bitcoin versus altcoins on CEXs, Ju disclosed that altcoins have been seeing significantly higher trading volume than BTC. Unlike previous bull market cycles, Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) is no longer the sole factor in determining the start of the altcoin season. Some analysts even suggest that the altcoin season is no longer dependent on Bitcoin dominance. Typically, during past altcoin seasons, investors and holders rotated their profits between Bitcoin and altcoins. This time, the CryptoQuant CEO suggests that even stablecoin holders move the market, favoring altcoins more than BTC and directly entering positions. Yu’s chart shows that altcoin volume on CEXs has exceeded that of Bitcoin by 2.71x based on the 90-day Moving Average (MA). Despite this increase, the CryptoQuant CEO warns that the rally set to follow the altcoin season will be selective, and not all altcoins may benefit. During the last bull run, the same event occurred, where only the most prominent coins, with proper utility, robust community, and a grand narrative, skyrocketed. On the other hand, low-cap altcoins experienced an increase, however, not as explosive as the ones recorded by coins like Solana, Cardano, and more. Based on Yu’s analysis the Bitcoin dominance no longer defines an altcoin season; rather, the trading volume does. Historically, a rise in BTC.D is seen as a deterrent to an altcoin season as the market is supposedly more interested in Bitcoin. Conversely, a decline in Bitcoin dominance is an indication of a shift in the market’s sentiment toward altcoins, signaling the possible onset of the altcoin season. Analyst Forecasts A Final Market Decline Before Altcoin Season While the start of an altcoin season could alleviate current bearish pressures on altcoins in the market, uncertainty still looms about whether this highly anticipated and recurring historical trend will occur in this bull cycle. A crypto analyst, identified as the ‘Alternative Bull’ has projected a final decline before the potential start of an altcoin season. The analyst forecasts that the altcoin season index chart will experience a significant drop and then skyrocket towards the 90 threshold before the end of 2025, as seen in the chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin Ready For ‘Take Off’—Analyst Reveals Key Signals Presently, the altcoin market cap, standing at $280.5 billion, has completed the second part of its previously formed Double Bottom pattern. This unique technical pattern is often seen as a bullish indicator, signaling a potential reversal from a downtrend to an uptrend. According to Rekt Capital on X, the altcoin market cap is attempting to break out of this pattern and initiate a bullish move towards a $300 billion valuation.

Jito (JTO) is making waves on the Solana network, having recently breached significant resistance levels, signaling a bullish trend, while PEPE is struggling to regain its footing following a sharp decline. But, it’s Web3Bay ’s 3BAY token that truly stands out, providing concrete utility in the burgeoning field of decentralized e-commerce. Unlike purely speculative tokens, 3BAY offers a multifaceted functionality encompassing staking, governance, and transactional utilities, reminiscent of Binance’s BNB. With a presale that has already amassed over $1.5 million, Web3Bay distinguishes itself as the best crypto investment with practical applications in the real world. Web3Bay’s 3BAY Token: The Best Crypto Investment for Early Backers? Web3Bay’s 3BAY token merges critical elements such as staking, governance, rewards, and transaction utility—akin to Binance’s BNB but with a focus on e-commerce. Token holders can enjoy benefits like passive income through staking, a voice in governance decisions, and discounts on transaction fees, making it a multipurpose asset within the Web3Bay ecosystem. With the presale rapidly progressing and over 375 million coins already sold, raising $1.5 million to date, the buzz around 3BAY continues to build. Currently priced at $0.004562625 per coin in its fourth presale stage, 3BAY offers investors an accessible entry point with substantial upside potential. Market analysts suggest that early adoption coupled with growing platform utilization could potentially drive the token’s value up by 100x, particularly as the demand for decentralized e-commerce solutions intensifies. For those looking for the best crypto investment with tangible utility and significant application in the real world, 3BAY presents an irresistible proposition just as it’s poised to capture the mainstream market. Jito’s Bullish Breakout Eyes $4.60 Amid Surging Demand Jito (JTO), a prominent liquid staking protocol on the Solana network, has recently soared past the crucial $2.90 resistance level, indicating a transition from bearish to bullish market sentiment, which could pave the way for further gains. This breakout has also seen a significant 76.01% spike in trading volume, underlining a growing interest in JTO tokens, while Open Interest has climbed by 6.46%, signaling increased market participation. Currently trading at $3.02 and eyeing the next resistance at $3.50, JTO has its sights set on a $4.60 target. However, sustaining momentum above the $2.90 mark remains key to continuing this bullish trend; failing which could lead to a pullback to support zones around $2.00 to $2.20. PEPE’s Price Struggles: Prospects for a Recovery? PEPE experienced a meteoric rise of nearly 30,000% to a peak of $0.0000283 in December 2024 but then suffered a 70% decline to $0.0000079 by February 2025. Recently, it broke below the $0.0000165 support level, now a formidable resistance, complicating its recovery efforts. Despite a rebound from a 308-day ascending support line suggesting a potential rally, indicators like the RSI and MACD remain bearish, hinting at continued weak momentum. Currently confined within a descending parallel channel—a typical indicator of ongoing corrections—PEPE’s short-term prospects hinge on overcoming this resistance. Long-term wave analysis suggests a potential extended correction phase lasting until December 2025, with a low target of $0.0000022. While there’s some optimism for short-term gains, PEPE faces significant hurdles ahead. Concluding Thoughts While Jito (JTO) capitalizes on its bullish momentum and PEPE grapples with overcoming resistance, Web3Bay’s 3BAY token stands out as a Best Crypto Investment with its foundation in real-world utility. Market fluctuations offer short-term opportunities, but the enduring value of a crypto asset is anchored in solid use cases. With 3BAY’s combination of staking, governance, and transaction benefits designed for the decentralized e-commerce space, it offers more than speculative potential. The strong presale performance, accumulating over $1.5 million, reflects robust investor confidence in 3BAY. As the cryptocurrency landscape matures, utility-focused tokens like 3BAY are likely to sustain growth, making them a prudent choice over alternatives driven by hype alone.

The token initially surged to $1.84 but quickly dropped to $0.64 as trading activity intensified. This early sell-off suggested that many holders took the opportunity to liquidate their tokens after the network transitioned to an open trading environment. However, the price has since rebounded dramatically, increasing by 97% in the last 24 hours. This rapid rise has made Pi the top trending coin on CoinMarketCap. Additionally, a community vote on Binance showed that 85% of users supported listing PI on the platform, which has further fueled interest in the coin. In just one day, Pi Coin saw an impressive 159.83% surge in price, reaching as high as $1.72 before stabilizing around $1.40. This rebound reflects strong buying interest and renewed confidence from the Pi Network community. Currently, Pi Coin is priced at $1.32, with a high of $1.52 and a low of $0.72. The price has shown signs of a bullish rally after breaking through key resistance levels, but some signs of potential short-term pullbacks are also emerging, with some traders noting bearish RSI divergence. Looking ahead, analysts are watching whether Pi will be able to maintain its momentum. If the price can hold above $1.10, there may be potential for further growth. However, if the coin fails to sustain its current price levels, it could face a pullback toward $0.94 to $1.00.

However, amid these established names, a fresh, vibrant token is emerging, catching the attention of shrewd traders with its promise of phenomenal value growth. With the bullish wave sweeping through the market, these opportunities are ripe for exploration, offering tantalizing prospects for unprecedented returns. The Enigmatic Allure of Catzilla: From Quirky Concept to Potential Powerhouse At the heart of this crypto adventure is Catzilla ($CATZILLA), a coin that marries the whimsical worlds of kaiju culture, internet memes, and digital currency. This peculiar blend is more than meets the eye. Beneath its playful façade lies a robust framework, evidenced by its structured presale and an expanding community driving the project forward. A Journey Through Catzilla’s Presale: The Strategic Path Ahead Catzilla's presale is ingeniously segmented into 14 stages, a tactic that ensures continued investor engagement. Each stage witnesses a price increment, rewarding early adopters with more favorable entry points. Insight into Current Presale Metrics: Current Price: $0.0009 Next Stage Price: $0.0010 Final Presale Price: $0.0016 Funds Raised So Far: $2.2M+ and growing Presently at Stage 7, there's palpable optimism within the CoinMarketCap community about its trajectory. As prices ascend with each stage, investors are eyeing these early stages for advantageous positions before market debut. Catch the $CATZILLA Wave Before It Escalates What Distinguishes Catzilla in the Meme Coin Universe? Although memes often drive coin popularity, Catzilla boasts additional merits besides mere viral charm. A Unique Concept The coin’s identity is rooted in a kaiju-style narrative, where a massive cat mascot wrecks havoc and collects rewards, offering a playful yet compelling storyline. Engaging Diverse Communities By intertwining anime, gaming, and meme cultures, Catzilla extends its appeal beyond typical crypto enthusiasts, aiming to draw: Investors seeking novel early-stage endeavors Fans of internet-driven viral phenomena Anime and gaming aficionados captivated by the kaiju motif Such a diverse audience base could bolster its long-term sustainability. Fostering Community Engagement A cornerstone of Catzilla's strategy is fostering robust community participation through governance voting, staking benefits, and play-to-earn elements, enhancing ecosystem vibrancy and longevity. Evaluating the Investment Proposition The presale is unfolding at a brisk pace, and with incremental price increases per stage, timing becomes crucial. Like most meme coins, it presents speculative risks but also significant potential, particularly with its gaming integration and community incentives. The project's future hinges on executing its roadmap effectively, making it a token worth monitoring closely. Consider the $CATZILLA Opportunity Cardano's Dual-Layer Advantage: A Deep Dive Cardano, renowned for its environmentally conscious proof-of-stake mechanism, leverages its dual-layer architecture to enhance scalability and smart contract execution. Its Settlement Layer handles transactions efficiently, while the Computing Layer supports complex contracts. These capabilities position ADA as a formidable player in the crypto landscape, promising scalability and lower transaction costs. Solana: Innovating with Scalability Solana focuses on delivering unmatched scalability, positioning itself as a robust platform for decentralized applications. Unlike its peers, it eschews sharding and second-layer solutions, opting for a unique architecture that enhances its high-capacity network. This, coupled with SOL's role in fueling the ecosystem, underscores its appeal to developers and investors alike. Wrapping Up While Cardano and Solana pursue ambitious price targets, Catzilla emerges as a compelling alternative, especially during its presale phase, with features that integrate community participation and game mechanics. It represents a vibrant opportunity for those ready to embrace its speculative allure and potentially considerable returns.

40715405,https://invezz.com/?p=2582142,1740282411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Crypto price predictions: Mantra, DeXe, Toncoin, IOTA",https://invezz.com/news/2025/02/23/crypto-price-predictions-mantra-dexe-toncoin-iota/,"Crypto prices rebounded during the weekend, with the total market of all coins soaring to over $3.20 trillion and the fear and greed index moving to the neutral level. This rebound was driven by speculation among crypto investors, who believe that these coins will do well this year. This article explores some of the top coins, including Mantra (OM), DeXe (DEXE), Toncoin (TON), and IOTA (IOTA). Mantra (OM) price forecast OM chart by TradingView Mantra price has done well in the past 12 months as it moved from being a fairly small coin into a $7 billion juggernaut. Its price has moved from $0.09 in 2023 to over $9 for the first time. The weekly chart shows that the OM price has soared in the past five consecutive months, beating other popular coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It has done this because of its high staking yield, regular airdrops to holders, and the fact that it is in the fast-growing Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization industry. Mantra price has remained above all moving averages, while all oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the stochastic oscillator have moved to the overbought level. There are signs that it remains in the markup phase of the Wyckoff Theory, which is characterized by high demand. Therefore, there is a likelihood that the Mantra price will keep soaring as bulls eye the target point at $10, and then resume the downtrend. Toncoin price analysis TON chart by TradingView Toncoin, the crypto project by Telegram, has been under pressure since Pavel Durov’s legal issues started in France a year ago. The TON price has crashed, while the total value locked (TVL) in its DeFi ecosystem has crashed. Most notably, the ecosystem has not done well, with tokens of most of its tap-to-earn games like Hamster Kombat and Notcoin crashing. The weekly chart shows that the TON price has retreated in the past few months after peaking at $8.24 in June last year. It has moved below $4, and crashed below the 50-week and 100-week moving averages. The MACD and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) have all pointed downwards, a sign that it is losing momentum. Therefore, the TON price will likely continue falling as sellers target the key support at $2.9154, the highest swing in October 2022. A drop below that point will point to a further retreat to $2. DeXe price forecast DeXe Protocol is a Web3 governance protocol whose token is well-known for the substantial staking yields it offers to its holders. Like Mantra, DEXE price has done well in the past few months as it surged from $1.87 in October last year to $20 in 2025. The DeXe token price has recently moved above the key resistance level at $18.18, the highest swing on April 1. This was an important price since it was the upper side of the cup and handle pattern, one of the most bullish patterns in the market. It is now in the handle phase, which is known for some consolidation. The DeXe price remains above the 50-week moving average, while the RSI and MACD are pointing upwards. Therefore, the price will likely explode higher in the long-term, with the next point to watch being at $27.20, the highest swing in November 2021. IOTA price analysis IOTA chart by TradingView The daily chart shows that the IOTA price peaked at $0.6362 in December last year and has now plunged to $0.2280. The 100-day and 50-day exponential moving averages are about to form a bearish crossover pattern, which is widely seen as a mini death cross. On the positive side, there are signs that it is about to form a bullish divergence pattern as the RSI and the MACD point upwards. It has also formed a falling wedge chart pattern, a popular bullish reversal sign. Therefore, the IOAT price will likely have a strong bullish breakout, with the next reference level being at $0.35.

The JV intends to apply for a license under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) new regulatory framework. HKD-Backed Stablecoin According to the official press release , SCBHK, Animoca Brands, and HKT have engaged in HKMA’s stablecoin issuer sandbox since July 2024. The trio has been assessing how stablecoins can facilitate financial market development and payments by connecting Web3 and traditional finance. The partnership is in line with Hong Kong’s ambition to strengthen its role as a global digital assets hub. By leveraging expertise across banking, telecommunications, and blockchain, the JV aims to create a secure and regulatory-compliant stablecoin framework. The initiative aligns with the city-state’s broader strategy to boost digital finance adoption while ensuring compliance with evolving regulatory requirements. In an official statement, Bill Winters, Group Chief Executive of Standard Chartered, said, “Digital assets are here to stay and the development of different forms of tokenized money is integral to the advancement of this industry. That is why we are actively involved in various Central Bank Digital Currencies, tokenized deposits, and, of course, stablecoins projects. We are introducing solutions and instruments that service this market and meet the growing client demand. As public chain instruments with proven use cases, stablecoins play a critical role in the overall digital asset ecosystem.” Hong Kong Eyes Bitcoin as a Strategic Asset Besides the ambitious stablecoin initiative, Hong Kong is also considering adding Bitcoin (BTC) to its fiscal reserves as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. Wu Jiexhuang, a Hong Kong legislative council member, recently proposed using foreign exchange funds to acquire Bitcoin, citing potential benefits such as attracting talent, boosting the local crypto industry, and increasing tax revenue. He said that leveraging China’s “one country, two systems” framework, adding Bitcoin to Hong Kong’s reserves could give the region an early advantage and help mitigate economic instability from its wider adoption in traditional financial markets.

In its filing with the SEC, Franklin Templeton revealed that it may occasionally stake a portion of the ETF’s assets through one or more trusted staking providers. According to the firm, the “Fund” would receive Solana tokens as rewards (which would also be treated as “income to the Fund”) for engaging in any staking activity. This spot Solana ETF would join the Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds in Franklin Templeton’s growing list of crypto products in the United States. Earlier this week, the asset manager launched its combined ETH and BTC ETF after receiving SEC approval in December 2024. Franklin Templeton’s proposal to offer the staking option in its spot Solana ETF is not exactly novel, as multiple issuers have considered this in other crypto products. For instance, the New York Stock Exchange filed for staking on Grayscale’s Ethereum ETFs, while Cboe BZX Exchange is looking to offer staking on 21Shares’ Ethereum fund. With the digital asset regulatory landscape improving in the United States, it is no surprise to see more traditional firms file for new crypto-based financial products . The growing clarity in the US crypto space was spotlighted by the SEC’s decision to drop its case against Coinbase. Solana Price Overview The price of SOL barely reacted to the news of Franklin Templeton’s spot Solana ETF filing. As of this writing, the Solana price stands at around $170, reflecting a 2% decline in the past 24 hours.",Solana|Franklin Templeton|solana|Solana ETF|Solana price|US SEC,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-23 04:00:08

Investors seeking the next high-growth opportunity have turned to FloppyPepe (FPPE) , a progressive AI agent token at the intersection of AI technology, DeFi, and blockchain that has already captured the market’s interest with its presale success. Solana’s (SOL) Struggles To Pave The Way For AI Agent Tokens Solana (SOL) faces mounting challenges that threaten its dominance. Once regarded as a top-tier blockchain network, Solana (SOL) now struggles with network congestion, security concerns, and competition from emerging AI tokens. Investors who previously looked to Solana (SOL) for high-growth opportunities are now shifting their focus toward AI tokens for scalability but groundbreaking advancements. The recent setbacks in the Solana (SOL) price performance and market volatility have raised concerns about the Solana (SOL) long-term viability, reinforcing the urgency for investors to explore more opportunities like FloppyPepe (FPPE). FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Explosive AI Agent Token FloppyPepe (FPPE) represents the evolution of AI-driven cryptocurrencies, positioning itself as the most promising AI agent token for 2025. The project’s unique AI-powered ecosystem is designed to transform content creation and user engagement, setting it apart from the wave of speculative tokens in the market. The AI agent token has Meme-o-Matic , a state-of-the-art AI meme generator that allows users to input text, video clips, and images, instantly converting them into viral content. This advanced AI agent token utility elevates FloppyPepe (FPPE) beyond meme coin status. FloppyPepe (FPPE) has already proven its market appeal, raising $500,000 in the first three days of its presale. The private round sold out at an astonishing $907,200 in just 24 hours, signaling the overwhelming demand for this AI agent token. With an AI beta launch scheduled for next week, the project is on track to surpass $1 million in presale revenue in its first week alone. Compared to any other AI agent token with a larger market cap, FloppyPepe (FPPE) still has enormous room for growth. The platform’s AI-powered video generation tool, FloppyX , empowers users to create top-tier video content with automated pipelines and character consistency features. Meanwhile, its text-to-image AI agent , launching on Telegram in two weeks, will further solidify its standing as a transformative AI project. Unlike the countless rug-pull meme coins flooding the market, this AI agent token guarantees authenticity through multi-signature wallets, a bug bounty program, and a smart contract audited by SolidProof. With plans for multi-chain integration across Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Solana (SOL), this AI agent token is set to capture an even broader investor base. The FloppyPepe (FPPE) ecosystem continues to gain traction, supported by a rapidly growing Telegram and X (Twitter) community, reinforcing its status as one of the most community-driven AI tokens in the market. With a 1% token burn mechanism built into its tokenomics, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is designed to increase in value as supply decreases over time. The redistribution model assures that investors can stake their tokens and receive rewards, with 3% of every transaction redistributed to the community, further incentivizing long-term holding. Experts predict that FloppyPepe (FPPE) could surge from the price of $0.0000002 by an astonishing 12,560%, turning even modest investments of $1,000, $5,000, or $10,000 into life-changing returns. With AI agent tokens dominating the market, now is the time to secure an early position before prices skyrocket. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is Taking Over The AI crypto sector is experiencing explosive growth, and FloppyPepe (FPPE) is at the forefront as the most compelling AI agent token on the market. With its presale raising $500,000 in just three days and its AI beta set to launch next week, the project is on an unstoppable trajectory toward massive gains. Its powerful AI-driven trading strategy, coupled with its forward-thinking DeFi applications, make it the ultimate AI investment for 2025. As Solana (SOL) struggles to maintain its relevance, the opportunity to capitalize on the next wave of AI crypto evolution is here. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is the future of AI-agent cryptocurrencies, and the time to adopt it is now.

The crypto market has been under strain since the highs of mid-January, but some changes stand out more than others. Ripple XRP is facing a key moment with a potential XRP ETF on the table, which could bring new institutional interest. Meanwhile, the Solana network is dealing with short-term price drops due to upcoming token unlocks but remains a strong force in blockchain development. Both assets are making moves, but they aren’t the only ones changing the game. While XRP and Solana push forward, a new force in Web3 and ecommerce is gaining attention. Web3Bay is taking on traditional marketplaces like Amazon and eBay, cutting out middlemen and giving users direct control over their transactions. The project has gained fame when crypto experts were found discussing its potential. Could this shift redefine online shopping the same way XRP is transforming payments? Web3 and E-commerce: A Shift Away from Traditional Marketplaces For years, online shopping has been dominated by centralized platforms like Amazon and eBay, which control transactions and charge high fees. Web3Bay is taking a different approach, offering a decentralized marketplace where buyers and sellers interact directly without intermediaries. Built on blockchain technology, it ensures transparency, security, and lower costs—all while giving users full ownership of their data and transactions. Its presale numbers show strong demand. Web3Bay has raised over $1.5 million, with more than 375 million 3BAY tokens sold. Currently in Stage 4 of 28, 3BAY is priced at $0.004562625, with prices increasing at each stage. By the time of launch, the token is expected to hit $0.1959, delivering an ROI of 6,430% to early participants. On top of the strong presale numbers, Web3Bay has also raised a lot of discussions about its disruptive potential and long-term returns, becoming a favourite of crypto Twitter. Just as Ripple XRP is reshaping cross-border payments and the Solana network is fueling decentralized applications, Web3Bay is positioning itself as the future of online shopping. With traditional platforms under pressure for high fees and control over users, a decentralized alternative like Web3Bay could become the go-to marketplace for Web3 commerce. Ripple XRP: ETF Speculation and Market Moves Ripple XRP is trading around $2.57, with its price movements closely tied to regulatory developments. The U.S. SEC is reviewing an application for an XRP ETF, which, if approved, could open the door for institutional investors. This would be a game-changing moment for XRP, making it more accessible to a broader market. Meanwhile, Ripple is expanding its real-world use cases, with recent efforts to integrate tokenized U.S. Treasuries on the XRP Ledger, further positioning it as a key player in blockchain-based finance. However, XRP isn’t the only crypto at a crossroads. The Solana network is facing its own challenges, but its long-term potential remains strong. As XRP navigates regulatory hurdles, Solana is dealing with supply pressures that could impact its price in the coming weeks. Solana Network: Price Pressure vs. Long-Term Strength The Solana network is currently priced at $166.31, with a recent 9% decline adding short-term uncertainty. A major factor behind this drop is the upcoming March 1 token unlock, which could flood the market with more SOL. Additionally, network activity has slowed, with active addresses dropping 55% since November 2024. Despite this, Solana remains a top choice for developers due to its high-speed, low-fee transactions, keeping it well-positioned for future growth. Market sentiment around Ripple XRP and other major cryptos is also influencing Solana’s price. Political shifts, such as Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance, have added optimism to the space, but overall volatility remains a challenge. While short-term uncertainty looms, Solana’s core technology and growing adoption could fuel a recovery in the long run. But while XRP and Solana focus on finance and blockchain infrastructure, Web3Bay is bringing blockchain’s benefits to an entirely different industry—online shopping. Key Insights Ripple XRP is at a key moment, with potential ETF approval bringing fresh opportunities. Meanwhile, the Solana network faces short-term price swings but continues to be a strong player in blockchain development. Both projects are driving innovation in their respective sectors, but Web3Bay is taking blockchain to an entirely new space—online commerce. Instead of just being another crypto project, Web3Bay is offering a real-world use case in Web3 and e-commerce, cutting out middlemen and empowering users. With a rapidly selling presale and a 6,430% ROI projected by launch, it’s shaping up to be one of the most disruptive platforms in the space. As the push for decentralization grows, Web3Bay could redefine online shopping in the same way XRP and Solana are transforming finance.

The price is currently facing resistance between $2.65 and $2.80. On the downside, there is significant support around $2.50, and below that, a stronger support zone between $2.25 and $2.30. Resistance Levels According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, the primary resistance zone for XRP lies between $2.65 and $2.80. The price has yet to break above this range, and until it does, the upward movement remains limited. If XRP can close above the $2.80 mark with confirmed candles, we could see a continued upward movement towards $3. Once reaching $3, however, the price could encounter resistance again around this level. Support Levels On the downside, XRP has decent support at around $2.50. Should the price fall below this level, there is stronger support in the range of $2.25 to $2.30. If the price fails to hold these levels, it could signal further downside potential. Long-Term Predictions On the larger time frame, XRP began a rally in July and has been following a potential upward structure. The key support area is between $1.20 and $1.27, and as long as the price stays above this range, the bullish outlook remains intact. This sideways range between $1.20 and $4.20 has been a common pattern for XRP, and it could continue for a while. The current price movement suggests the upside may still be incomplete, and a break above the previous highs of $2.65 to $2.80 could signal a continuation toward the $5-$6 target range for the next cycle.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-23 04:07:39

Some, like Bitcoin, Mantra, and BNB have become highly popular and rewarding to their investors. Mantra has had quadruple gains in the past 12 months. Ghost chains refer to layer-1 and layer-2 blockchains that don’t have a thriving ecosystem of applications. These chains differ from other popular ones like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche that have an active ecosystem. So, this article explores some of the most overvalued ghost chain crypto coins to avoid in 2025. Cardano (ADA) Cardano is the most overvalued ghost chain crypto coin in the industry, with a market cap of over $27 billion. It has become the 9th biggest cryptocurrency in the world, making it bigger than popular tokens like Avalanche, Stellar, and Litecoin. Cardano’s popularity surged in 2021 when it was seen as the best alternative to Ethereum, which was then a proof-of-work (PoW) network. At its peak, Cardano was valued at over $90 billion. Today, Cardano is a ghost chain with no ecosystem. According to DeFi Llama , Cardano has a total value locked (TVL) of over $368 million and just $21 million in stablecoins. A closer look at its ecosystem shows that most of the biggest players are not popular. Liqwid, the biggest lending network in Cardano has a TVL of just $81 million. In contrast, AAVE, the biggest lending player in DeFi has over $20 billion. Minswap, the biggest DeX netwok in Cardano, handles less than $10,000 in volume a day. Near Protocol (NEAR) Near Potocol is another large ghost chain in the crypto industry. The NEAR token has a market cap of over $4 billion, making it the 29th biggest player in the crypto industry. Near Protocol is a layer-1 network that aims to be a better alternative to Ethereum and Cardano. It was one of the first chains to incorporate the concept of sharding, which slashed blocks into shards to supercharge its throughput. Near Protocol is a ghost chain because of its relatively small ecosystem. It has just 30 dApps in the decentralized finance industry. Burrow, a lending protocol, is the biggest dApp in the Near Protocol ecosystem with a TVL of $125 million. It is followed by Ref Finance, a DEX network that handles little volume a day. Near Protocol has established itself as a top c rypto coin in the artificial intelligence industry, but there are no major notable dApps so far. Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) Hedera Hashgraph is another overvalued ghost chain coin in the crypto industry. HBAR token has gained a market cap of over $9 billion. This growth was mostly because of its huge partnerships with top companies like IBM, Google, and Servicenow. HBAR token has also surged as odds of a spot Hedera ETF rose. Hedera Hashgraph has a relatively small ecosystem to justify the $9 billion market cap. It only has a total value locked of just $114 million, down from $214 million earlier this month. The biggest players in the ecosystem are Stader, SaucerSwap, and Bonzo Finance. Other popular ghost chain crypto coins to avoid There are many other popular ghost chain crypto coins to avoid this year. The most notable of them are Algorand , Stacks, Celo, Injective, Internet Computer, and XDC Network. To be clear: at times, these ghost chain crypto coins may surge in the long term. That’s because it is always difficult to value a cryptocurrency. Besides, mene coins, which have no utility have a combined market cap of over $73 billion, with the biggest ones being the likes of Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe.

The American rapper and businessman had yet another full-on Nazi meltdown, after failing to get Changpeng Zhao’s (CZ) phone number. Ye first teased plans for launching his “real” coin, then spiraled into a racial slur-filled tirade, as per usual. The hitmaker shared a chat with Mikey Shelton, who told him, “You are the brand. Whatever it is will do well. Some things are better than others. It’s about who you trust.” Another message showed Edward explaining , “Using Cardano as an example, they had the Cardano token, a wallet system, a whitepaper, a roadmap website, etc. You could set up a similar structure.” Kanye follows CZ, demands his number, then snapped Ye had suddenly followed Binance’s CZ on X Saturday, making him the only person he followed. The action immediately triggered collaboration rumors within the community, which CZ fueled with lighthearted replies to Ye’s tweets. Kanye then publicly asked CZ for his number, writing: “Wait Why all these n*ggas HONKEYS Jews & f*ggots won’t give me CZ’s number?” Moments later, he posted, “Oh wait CZ DM’d me I still stand on what I said though.” Ye was referring to the fact that CZ had commented under his tweet asking for the number and said “DM’ed you,” along with a laughing emoji. As of press time, CZ remains unfollowed by Ye, who has replaced him with Polychain Capital founder Olaf Carlson-Wee and grifter Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports. Then, Ye posted an edited/rebranded Binance logo featuring a swastika with the caption, “New Binance Logo.” Yeah, it’s that bad. Now folks in the community are saying Binance’s CZ is definitely backing out of the collaboration now. CZ, notably, has remained quiet, but we don’t see how he’s gonna get over this. Community Notes warn Kanye’s crypto posts are a scam As Kanye rambled about his Nazi-inspired crypto (Swasticoin), Community Notes flagged his tweets, claiming he “sold access to his account to Christian Barker, aka @barkmeta on X.” Users pointed out suspicious changes in dark/light mode and time formats in his screenshots, saying that multiple people were posting from his account. One note read, “This will be a major liquidity extraction event.” Another warning said, “It appears that Ye has sold access to his X account to a known crypto scammer. His tweets may promote a malicious token launch and are intended to scam users. Please be cautious and avoid engaging with these tweets or any related links.” Ye posted a video of himself to prove he didn’t sell the account, with Olaf of Polychain. He has now ignored the warnings and keeps posting erratically. He declared, “I’M PUTTING MY SWASTICOIN ON A DEX BECAUSE ITS DECENTRALIZED.” Ye also said that his token was already attracting attention, writing, “PEOPLE WHO DIDN’T LIKE THE NAZI POSTS HITTING ME UP FOR THE CA ON MY SWASTICOIN. Wait What’s a CA?” At the same time, Kanye insisted he was creating a legitimate financial system. In one post, he wrote, “YEEZY IS HERE TO CREATE A REAL CURRENCY ANY FIELD I GO INTO I LEARN FROM THE BEST AND TREAT THEIR LIFE LONG WORK WITH THE HIGHEST RESPECT.” But minutes later, he contradicted himself again, stating, “I TRULY LIKE JEWISH PEOPLE THEY JUST CAN NO LONGER BE THE CREATIVE DIRECTORS OF THE PLANET THEY ARE THE BULLIES, NO I’M THE BULLY.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Are You Making These Web3 Resume Mistakes? - Find Out Here",News|Binance,EN,0,0,BNB|EXCHANGE|ADA|PEOPLE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-23 04:36:35

This issue is gaining renewed attention after rapper Kanye West, who now goes by “Ye,” announced plans to launch a so-called “Swasticoin” in a series of controversial social media posts. West’s statements, which included antisemitic remarks about the Jewish community, mark a shift from his previous criticism of celebrity-backed coins that “prey” on fans. You might also like: Kanye West’s Super Bowl 2025 ad sparks Nazi-themed crypto frenzy On Saturday, West seemingly changed his mind. “I’m going to open the CA [contract address] for my Swasticoin to Jewish people and my friends and family first,” he wrote. Alongside this announcement, the “Jesus Walks” singer appeared to seek guidance on blockchain networks like Ethereum, Solana and BNB Chain, while also attempting to contact Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao. The posts sparked backlash, but they also highlighted a broader issue: the increasing number of meme coins promoting extremist ideology. A troubling trend Ye’s proposed token is not an isolated case. Over the past year, a wave of racist and offensive tokens have launched, prompting discussions about whether decentralized platforms should implement content moderation. Some of these tokens used racial slurs or Nazi imagery in their branding, attempting to gain traction in online extremist communities. “Hitler Musk,” for example, appeared on Pump.fun about a month ago after X owner Elon Musk, while speaking at President Donald Trump’s inauguration event, did a straight-a rm salute twice (observers interpreted it as a reference to Nazi-fascism). Before that, in 2021, a token named “HITLER” briefly surfaced before being delisted from exchanges. Another coin, “Groyper,” has been linked to far-right online communities. Despite the fleeting nature of these projects, their presence underscores how blockchain technology—while open and permissionless—can be exploited to spread harmful ideologies. Who’s addressing the issue? As racist meme coins proliferate, some in the crypto industry are taking steps to curb their spread. The Solana Foundation has acknowledged the problem, with Austin Federa, the foundation’s head of strategy, suggesting that in-app filtering could be a potential solution. This would allow wallet apps and decentralized exchanges to screen out tokens with offensive names or imagery. However, implementing such measures in a decentralized system remains a challenge. Racist meme coins can be dealt with by in-app filtering, argues @SolanaFndn 's @Austin_Federa , @thesamreynolds writes https://t.co/e6U1FGVgng — CoinDesk (@CoinDesk) March 29, 2024 Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has also criticized the rise of meme coins associated with dictatorships and racist themes , calling for higher-quality projects in the crypto space. Last March, Buterin expressed concern over the growing number of speculative assets that provide little value beyond short-term hype. He specifically pointed to Solana-based meme coins that he described as “openly super-racist” and condemned tokens linked to totalitarian regimes. Buterin emphasized that he has “zero enthusiasm” for projects driven by scams, rugpulls, or fleeting excitement that ultimately disappoints investors. But, in today’s day and age, where anyone can launch a token with meme coin generators (i.e., Pump.fun) without oversight. As a result, the problem persists. What’s Next? According to Coindesk, West’s planned token—possibly named “YZY” rather than “Swasticoin”—is intended as a workaround for Shopify’s restrictions on his Yeezy store. Reports suggest he plans to keep 70% of the token’s supply for himself, further fueling speculation that this is more about financial gain than ideology. This would align with Ye’s previous attempts to monetize Nazi imagery, including selling T-shirts labeled “HH-01” (widely interpreted as shorthand for “Heil Hitler”), which were removed after a Super Bowl ad directed traffic to his website. Despite Ye’s claim that the token will launch next week, it remains unclear if the project will materialize—or if it is another instance of inflammatory rhetoric designed to provoke outrage. His latest post simply read: “Time to launch my own blockchain,” leaving his actual crypto ambitions uncertain. West was reportedly inspired by Official Trump ( TRUMP ), the meme coin President Trump launched two days before his second inauguration. It’s currently down 78% from its all-time high. Trump raised eyebrows for his similarly massive insider-ownership distribution: 80% of TRUMP is currently held by CIC Digital, a business entity with ties to the president. Ye, too, wanted an 80% ownership stake but was negotiated down to 70%, CoinDesk. Should his token achieve even a fraction of TRUMP’s success, his stake could still be worth many millions of dollars. What is certain, however, is that racist meme coins continue to test the boundaries of crypto’s “wild-west” nature while industry leaders grapple with how to moderate offensive content.

He compared prediction markets to traditional news sources, asserting that prediction markets communicate information more quickly than newspapers or broadcast media. In an interview, Tenev described the potential of prediction markets and their place in Robinhood’s business model. The CEO of Robinhood believes without a doubt that prediction markets are the future of trading and information. Robinhood’s election prediction market sees record activity Robinhood saw a lot of activity around the prediction market for the 2024 U.S. presidential election. The platform tracked Donald Trump’s victory to a large extent, although Kamala Harris had a late surge after an Iowa poll was found to be inaccurate. Increased interest in the election drove a spike in prediction markets across multiple betting platforms. Robinhood had previously launched Super Bowl event contracts earlier this year but suspended their rollout after a CFTC request. Yet amid regulatory uncertainty, Tenev is optimistic about the future of the sector. He noted prediction markets are here to stay and asserted that this will be revealed over time. Tenev made the company’s broader aims for prediction markets known during Robinhood’s Q4 2024 earnings call. “We had more than half a billion contracts traded in just about a week leading into the election. You can expect a full events platform from us, with access to prediction markets across many diverse contracts later this year,” said Vlad Tenev Aside from Robinhood’s efforts, several major players, such as UMA, Polymarket, and EigenLayer, are working together to build a next-generation oracle infrastructure for prediction markets. This joint effort has several advantages, including improved mechanisms for resolving disputes, aligned participant incentives, and scalability and security. Advanced oracles shape decentralized truth in prediction markets Since its launch in 2020, Polymarket—the leading decentralized prediction market—has passed $6 billion in lifetime volume and resolved 14,000+ markets. Oracle systems available today do not scale well and suffer from subjective market outcomes. To solve these limitations, UMA , Polymarket, and EigenLayer are joining forces to research and develop the next-generation generation oracle based on EigenLayer’s intersubjective verification and UMA’s Optimistic Oracle (OO). With multi-token dispute resolution, the use of different tokens for staking and governance, and several other fundamental improvements, this next-generation mechanism will be a great leap forward as compared to our current system. In addition, it introduces dynamic bonding and AI integration, establishing dynamic bond commitments designed to strengthen economic security. The new oracle will also have improved bribery resistance through the security model of EigenLayer, which minimizes manipulation threats in the new oracle and increases scalability for high-volume markets, increasing dispute resolution efficiency for markets with thousands of active contracts. Polymarket’s founder, Shayne Coplan, highlighted the need for solid oracle solutions, noting that integrating Polymarket’s infrastructure, UMA’s optimistic oracle and EigenLayer’s security framework will reshape the establishment of decentralized truth. With Robinhood and the top players in the blockchain industry leading the charge, prediction markets could soon become a mainstream instrument for real-time, data-informed forecasting in multiple industries.

At the same time, Avalanche continues to struggle, and buyers are taking advantage of the discounted price. Lunex Network is also recording high adoption rates as the broader market sentiment is slowly but surely turning bullish. Litecoin (LTC) Could Become Third US Spot ETF with $580 Million Yearly Inflow Canary Capital filed an application for a Litecoin ETF in October 2024, making analysts optimistic about a potential approval during Q1. Litecoin’s proof-of-work consensus makes it less likely to be labeled as a security. Analysts are already anticipating up to $580 million in first-year inflows by the Litecoin ETF, opening up an avenue of new opportunities for Litecoin traders. Litecoin is currently trading for $129 after a 5.2% intraday decrease. Litecoin’s trading volume has recorded a 30% decline during the last 24 hours which suggests decreased market participation. Despite the minor pullback, Litecoin is still trading above all of its Exponential Moving Averages on the LTC/USDT daily chart. Since Litecoin’s Momentum Indicator also suggests bullish dominance, Litecoin’s price could rally toward the critical $200 resistance before the end of Q1. Avalanche (AVAX) Struggles Continue As It Rests On Support Avalanche’s price broke below the critical $34 level in early February and the AVAX price entered a downward spiral amid the market-wide bearish sentiment. Before the breakdown, Avalanche’s whale wallets also recorded positive net inflows in January leading to a $600 million capital inflow for Avalanche. Although most of these positions are now underwater, confidence in Avalanche’s long-term prospects is still high as analysts expect a major comeback once the market regains its footing. Avalanche is now trading for $24.60 after an intraday increase of 3.4%. Right now, Avalanche is trading below most of its long-term Exponential Moving Averages on the AVAX/USDT daily chart which means that its price is still in bearish territory. Lunex Network (LNEX) Attracts Capital Inflow with B2B Payment Gateway Lunex Network may not have an ETF of its own, but it has still managed to accumulate more than $7.2 million in capital inflows within a few weeks of its presale launch. Lunex Network’s altcoin is trending in the market for several reasons, but the most standout feature is the interconnected ecosystem that facilitates seamless cross-chain trading. By integrating the latest Web3 technology, Lunex Network is removing the barriers between isolated blockchain networks and bridging them with its disruptive ecosystem. With more than 50,000 compatible tokens, Lunex Network allows users to trade cryptocurrencies across 40+ different blockchains without any additional cost.

Cryptocurrency exchange behemoth Bybit suffered a $1.4 billion hack this week, whereas BTC and altcoins remained stagnant despite market advancements. Simultaneously, the meme coin sector panicked amid the emergence of the Argentinian LIBRA token. Here’s a brief collection of some of the top crypto market updates reported by CoinGape Media over the past week. Weekly Crypto Highlights: ByBit Exchange Hacked By N. Korean Group The renowned cryptocurrency exchange Bybit was hacked by ‘The Lazarus Group’ this week, resulting in a massive exploitation of funds. Reportedly, the North Korean criminal organization stole $1.4 billion worth of ETH from the crypto exchange. As a result, the broader crypto market saw a whopping $566 million liquidated in a day as investors started panic selling. In turn, BTC and altcoins reversed recent gains, backtracking to previous lows. BTC price closed the week at around $96K, whereas ETH was near $2,800. XRP & SOL also reversed recent gains, trading in the red this weekend. It’s also worth mentioning that ByBit rolled out a $140 million bounty for cybersecurity experts to recover $1.4 billion stolen in Ethereum. LIBRA Token Panic: What Happened? Meanwhile, Argentinian President Javier Milei endorsed the Solana-based LIBRA meme token this week, which soon rocketed in value. However, the market was taken by storm when insiders cashed out massive amounts amid the rally, urging LIBRA price to crash over 90%. This saga raised rug-pull concerns surrounding the crypto, further bringing heat to its price. However, President Javier Milei ordered a probe into the launch and KIP Protocol, aiming to rectify the error and bolster the token. This saga has emerged as another noteworthy crypto highlight this week, underscoring the market’s risky nature. ETF Filings This Week Simultaneously, a stockpile of ETF advancements was witnessed this week. Canary Capital’s Litecoin ETF emerged on Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), solidifying chances of approval. Further, Grayscale’s XRP ETF entered the U.S. SEC’s review mode. Also, asset manager Franklin Templeton filed an S-1 to launch a spot Solana ETF with the U.S. SEC this week.

40716623,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=133082,1740289055,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent: Bitcoin ETFs Bleed for 4th Day – Is Investor Confidence Shaken?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-etf-outflows-investor-confidence/,"Just when Bitcoin seemed to be riding an unstoppable wave of institutional adoption fueled by the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, a concerning trend has emerged. For four consecutive days, these much-hyped investment vehicles have experienced net outflows, signaling a potential shift in investor sentiment. Are we witnessing a temporary profit-taking phase, or is this the beginning of a deeper correction in the crypto market? Let’s delve into the details of these Bitcoin ETF outflows and understand what’s driving this recent market activity. Decoding the Data: Spot Bitcoin ETFs See Continued Outflows According to data from Farside Investors, February 21st marked the fourth straight day of net Bitcoin ETF outflows in the U.S. A total of $62.9 million exited these funds, painting a contrasting picture to the massive inflows witnessed in the weeks following their launch. To understand the nuances of this situation, let’s break down the performance of individual ETFs: Grayscale’s GBTC: The veteran ETF, GBTC, continued to experience significant withdrawals, leading the pack with a substantial $60 million outflow. This ongoing trend is likely attributed to investors capitalizing on arbitrage opportunities and moving away from GBTC’s higher fee structure compared to newer ETFs. Bitwise’s BITB: BITB saw a considerable $16.6 million in net outflows, suggesting that the selling pressure wasn’t limited to GBTC alone. Fidelity’s FBTC: FBTC, another major player, also recorded net outflows of $12.5 million, indicating a broader trend across the established spot Bitcoin ETFs . However, it’s not all gloom and doom. Interestingly, two ETFs bucked the trend, showcasing continued investor interest in specific offerings: BlackRock’s IBIT: BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, a standout performer since launch, continued its inflow streak, attracting a net $21.6 million. This positive momentum suggests strong investor confidence in BlackRock’s brand and ETF management. VanEck’s HODL: VanEck’s HODL also reported inflows, albeit smaller, at $4.7 million. This indicates a niche appeal or potentially different investor base for HODL. Other ETFs: The remaining spot Bitcoin ETFs reported negligible changes, suggesting a mixed bag of investor activity across the board. To get a clearer picture, let’s look at a table summarizing the inflows and outflows on February 21st: ETF Net Flow (USD Million) Grayscale (GBTC) -60.0 Bitwise (BITB) -16.6 Fidelity (FBTC) -12.5 BlackRock (IBIT) +21.6 VanEck (HODL) +4.7 Others Negligible Change Total Net Flow -62.9 Why are Bitcoin ETF Outflows Happening Now? Several factors could be contributing to this recent trend of Bitcoin ETF outflows . It’s crucial to consider these possibilities to understand the bigger picture: GBTC Fee Structure: As mentioned earlier, GBTC’s relatively higher management fee (1.5%) compared to new entrants (many offering fees below 0.3% and even fee waivers initially) makes it less attractive for long-term holders. Investors might be rotating out of GBTC to benefit from lower fees in competing crypto ETFs . Profit Taking: Bitcoin has experienced a significant price surge since the beginning of the year, fueled partly by the ETF hype. Some investors might be taking profits off the table after this substantial run-up, leading to temporary outflows. Market Correction: The broader crypto market, and Bitcoin specifically, often experiences periods of correction after rapid growth. These bitcoin etf outflows could be a symptom of a natural market pullback, as investors reassess their positions and risk appetite. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic uncertainties, inflation concerns, and changes in interest rate expectations can influence investor behavior across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Shifts in macroeconomic sentiment could be triggering some of the outflows. Rotation into Altcoins: With Bitcoin’s price appreciating significantly, some investors might be rotating profits into alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) which often exhibit higher volatility and potentially greater short-term gains during certain market cycles. Impact on Bitcoin Price and Market Sentiment While four days of outflows don’t necessarily signify a long-term bearish trend, they do warrant attention. Sustained Bitcoin ETF outflows could exert downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, especially if the selling momentum intensifies. The market closely monitors ETF flows as indicators of institutional and retail investor sentiment. Negative flows can be interpreted as a lack of confidence or reduced demand, potentially triggering further selling or dampening buying interest. However, it’s important to remember that: IBIT’s Inflows are Positive: BlackRock’s IBIT continuing to attract inflows is a significant positive sign, indicating that institutional demand for Bitcoin exposure through ETFs remains robust. Long-Term Perspective: The spot Bitcoin ETFs are still relatively new. Market dynamics and investor behavior are likely to evolve over time. Short-term fluctuations in flows are expected and don’t necessarily negate the long-term potential of these investment products. Overall ETF Success: Despite recent outflows, the overall launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs has been considered a massive success, bringing billions of dollars into the crypto market and broadening access to Bitcoin for mainstream investors. What’s Next for Spot Bitcoin ETFs? The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether these crypto ETF outflows are a temporary blip or the start of a more sustained trend. Market participants will be closely watching daily flow data, Bitcoin price action, and broader market sentiment. Key questions to consider include: Will GBTC outflows continue to dominate, or will they eventually stabilize? Can IBIT and other ETFs maintain their inflow momentum to offset outflows from other funds? How will Bitcoin’s price react to these ETF flow dynamics? Will macroeconomic events or regulatory developments further influence ETF flows? Final Thoughts: Navigating the Bitcoin ETF Landscape The recent net outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs serve as a reminder of the inherent volatility and dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the initial euphoria surrounding ETF launches may be moderating, it’s crucial to maintain a balanced perspective. The market is still in its early stages of integrating these new investment vehicles. Understanding the nuances of ETF flows, individual ETF performance, and broader market trends is essential for investors navigating this exciting, yet evolving landscape. Don’t panic based on short-term fluctuations; instead, focus on long-term trends and the fundamental drivers of Bitcoin and the crypto market.

But what happens when the very institutions designed to safeguard AI are facing the chopping block? News has emerged that the US AI Safety Institute (AISI), a crucial body within the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is facing potentially devastating budget cuts. This development sends shockwaves through the tech community, raising serious questions about the future of AI regulation and safety in the United States. Why the Concern Over US AI Safety Institute Cuts? Imagine building a super-fast car without brakes. That’s essentially what unchecked AI development could become. The AISI was established to be the ‘brake’ – the organization studying potential AI risks and setting crucial safety standards. Created just last year under a previous presidential executive order, its mission is to ensure that AI development proceeds responsibly. However, recent reports paint a grim picture: Massive Layoffs Looming: Axios and Bloomberg reports indicate that NIST, the parent organization of AISI, is planning significant layoffs, potentially affecting up to 500 staffers. These cuts are expected to heavily impact probationary employees, many of whom are likely working within the AISI and Chips for America initiatives. AISI ‘Gutted’: Sources suggest that the US AI Safety Institute is being specifically targeted and could be “gutted” by these layoffs. This means a significant reduction in personnel and resources dedicated to AI safety research and development. Leadership Vacuum: Adding to the turmoil, AISI’s director recently departed in February. This leadership gap, combined with potential staff reductions, creates a perfect storm of instability for the fledgling organization. Policy Reversal: The executive order that initially established AISI was repealed by the current administration, casting further doubt on the institute’s long-term viability and political backing. These potential AI Safety Institute cuts are not just numbers on a spreadsheet; they represent a tangible threat to the nation’s capacity to navigate the complex landscape of AI safety. Expert Voices Raise the Alarm on AI Regulation Impact The news of potential layoffs has been met with widespread criticism from AI safety and policy experts. Jason Green-Lowe, executive director of the Center for AI Policy, voiced serious concerns, stating that these cuts would “severely impact the government’s capacity to research and address critical AI safety concerns.” His sentiment is echoed across the AI safety community. Cutting resources from AISI now is seen as incredibly short-sighted, especially when: AI Risks are Escalating: As AI models become more powerful and integrated into various aspects of life, the potential risks – from bias and misuse to unforeseen consequences – are also growing. Global Race in AI: Nations worldwide are investing heavily in AI research and development. Weakening the US’s AI safety infrastructure could put the country at a disadvantage in the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies. Need for Standards: AISI’s role in developing standards and best practices for AI is crucial for ensuring interoperability, safety, and ethical considerations are built into AI systems from the ground up. Reduced capacity in this area could lead to fragmented and potentially unsafe AI development. The Broader Implications of NIST Layoffs for AI and Tech While the focus is on the US AI Safety Institute , the reported NIST layoffs AI extend beyond just this single organization. NIST plays a vital role in numerous sectors, including technology, manufacturing, and cybersecurity. Cuts of this magnitude could have ripple effects across various critical areas: NIST Area Potential Impact of Cuts AI Safety Research Slowdown in research, reduced capacity to identify and mitigate AI risks. Chips for America Potential delays or scaling back of initiatives to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing. Technology Standards Development Slower development of crucial technology standards, impacting innovation and interoperability. Cybersecurity Weakened cybersecurity research and standards, potentially increasing vulnerability to cyber threats. These potential cuts raise serious questions about the direction of Government AI safety policy and the prioritization of technological safety and regulation in the current political climate. Are we sacrificing long-term safety and responsible innovation for short-term budget savings? Navigating the Uncertain Future of AI Safety The situation surrounding the US AI Safety Institute is fluid and concerning. While the reports of layoffs are still developing, the potential consequences for AI safety and regulation are significant. It underscores the ongoing tension between fostering innovation and ensuring responsible technological development. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, the implications are also relevant. AI is increasingly intertwined with blockchain technology, from enhancing security and efficiency to powering new decentralized applications. A robust and well-regulated AI ecosystem is essential for the continued growth and trust in decentralized technologies. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining the extent of these cuts and their lasting impact on the AI regulation impact and the future of AI safety in the US.

Similarly, the burgeoning field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) faces its own tests of credibility, especially when it comes to AI benchmarks . This week, a public spat erupted, echoing the crypto world’s demand for accountability, as an OpenAI employee publicly questioned the integrity of xAI , Elon Musk’s AI venture, accusing them of presenting potentially misleading benchmarks for their latest model, Grok 3. Was xAI truly showcasing Grok 3’s capabilities accurately, or were these AI benchmarks designed to paint a rosier picture? Let’s delve into this fascinating AI showdown. The Benchmark Battleground: Are Grok 3’s Claims Valid? The heart of the controversy lies in how AI benchmarks are reported, and more crucially, interpreted. xAI , aiming to position Grok 3 as a leading AI, released a blog post highlighting its performance on the AIME 2025 (American Invitational Mathematics Examination) dataset. This dataset, despite some debates about its suitability as a definitive AI benchmark , is widely used to gauge a model’s mathematical reasoning prowess. xAI’s initial graph touted two versions of Grok 3 – Grok 3 Reasoning Beta and Grok 3 mini Reasoning – as outperforming OpenAI’s ‘o3-mini-high’ model on AIME 2025. However, this claim quickly drew fire from OpenAI insiders on X (formerly Twitter). The crux of their argument? The graph conveniently omitted a critical detail: ‘cons@64’ scores for OpenAI’s model. What is ‘cons@64’ and Why Does It Matter for AI Benchmarks? For those unfamiliar, ‘cons@64’ is short for ‘consensus@64.’ Imagine giving an AI model 64 attempts to solve each problem in a benchmark. ‘cons@64’ essentially does this, selecting the most frequently generated answers as the model’s final responses. This method can significantly inflate benchmark scores, making a model appear more capable than it might be in a single-attempt scenario. Think of it like this: @1 (Single Attempt): This reflects the model’s performance on its first try – arguably a more realistic measure of its immediate capability. cons@64 (64 Attempts Consensus): This shows the model’s potential best performance after multiple tries, leveraging statistical probability to arrive at the ‘best’ answer. By not including the ‘cons@64’ score for o3-mini-high, xAI’s graph potentially created a skewed comparison, suggesting Grok 3 surpassed OpenAI’s model when, in reality, the picture might be more nuanced. Grok 3 vs. OpenAI: Decoding the Benchmark Data Looking at the ‘@1’ scores, the initial performance metric, reveals a different story. Grok 3 Reasoning Beta and Grok 3 mini Reasoning actually fall short of o3-mini-high’s score on AIME 2025. Furthermore, Grok 3 Reasoning Beta even slightly lags behind OpenAI’s ‘o1’ model, even when the ‘o1’ model is set to ‘medium’ computing resources. Despite these figures, xAI is actively marketing Grok 3 as the “world’s smartest AI.” This bold claim, juxtaposed with the benchmark data nuances, raises eyebrows and fuels the debate about transparency in AI marketing. Was xAI’s Benchmark Presentation Misleading? Igor Babushkin, a co-founder of xAI , defended the company’s approach on X, arguing that OpenAI has also, in the past, presented misleading benchmarks – albeit in charts comparing their own models. This tit-for-tat highlights a broader issue: the lack of standardized and transparent practices in reporting AI benchmarks across the industry. Adding another layer to the discussion, a neutral observer, Teortaxes (@teortaxesTex on X), compiled a more comprehensive graph. This graph included ‘cons@64’ scores for a wider range of models, providing a more balanced perspective. Hilarious how some people see my plot as attack on OpenAI and others as attack on Grok while in reality it’s DeepSeek propaganda (I actually believe Grok looks good there, and openAI’s TTC chicanery behind o3-mini-*high*-pass@”””1″””” deserves more scrutiny.) pic.twitter.com/3WH8FOUfic — Teortaxes (DeepSeek 推特 铁粉 2023 – ∞) (@teortaxesTex) February 20, 2025 This neutral graph aimed to present a clearer picture, though it inadvertently sparked further debate, showcasing the sensitivity and complexity surrounding AI benchmark comparisons. The Missing Piece: Computational Cost in AI Benchmarks AI researcher Nathan Lambert brought up a crucial, often overlooked, point. He highlighted that the computational and financial resources required for each model to achieve its benchmark scores remain largely undisclosed. This lack of transparency is a significant limitation of current AI benchmarks . A model might achieve a high score, but at what cost? Is it computationally efficient, or does it require massive resources, making it less practical for real-world applications? Consider these questions: Efficiency: How much computing power does each model consume to reach its benchmark score? Cost: What is the financial implication of running each model at scale? Practicality: Is a high-scoring but resource-intensive model truly superior to a slightly lower-scoring, but far more efficient, alternative? Without this crucial context of computational cost, AI benchmarks offer an incomplete picture of a model’s true capabilities and limitations. Navigating the AI Benchmark Maze: What Does This Mean for the Future? The Grok 3 benchmark controversy underscores a critical need for greater transparency and standardization in the AI industry. For users, investors, and the broader public to make informed decisions about AI technologies, we need AI benchmarks that are: Comprehensive: Going beyond single scores to include various performance metrics and contexts. Transparent: Clearly outlining testing methodologies, including details like ‘cons@64’ and computational costs. Standardized: Adhering to industry-wide accepted protocols to ensure fair comparisons across different models and labs. The debate surrounding Grok 3’s misleading benchmarks serves as a potent reminder: scrutiny and critical evaluation are essential, not just in the crypto space, but also in the rapidly evolving world of Artificial Intelligence. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into our lives, demanding clarity and honesty in performance claims is more important than ever. The future of AI hinges not just on technological advancement, but also on building trust and accountability within the industry.

He argued that Argentina is willing to have a mutual free trade deal with the United States, saying its only hindrance is its membership ties to Mercosur, the South American trade bloc. He commented : “I want to take this chance to announce that Argentina wants to be the first country in the world to join this reciprocal accord that the Trump administration proposed on trade matters.” – Javier Milei Argentina’s Milei endorsed Trump’s reciprocal tariff plans Javier Milei met with Donald Trump on the sidelines of the CPAC conference and showed support for the billionaire’s reciprocal tariff plans, which many other countries have seemingly criticized. According to the Argentine government, the two also spoke about the economic measures Milei is advancing in his country and how crucial it is for both countries to collaborate with each other. Moreover, during his speech at the conference, the Argentine president repeatedly endorsed some of Trump’s strategies while bashing what he called “a political class with a God complex.” He also promised to work together with countries that share his vision of freedom and want to root out state bureaucracy, seeing Trump as one of his ideological allies. Aside from Trump, Milei also met with Tesla CEO Elon Musk and even handed him a chainsaw, his government’s symbol of ending state bureaucracy. He also talked with International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva about an IMF loan, which he believes could help grow his country’s economy. Milei is still under investigation for marketing a suspicious meme token While the Argentine leader is seemingly showing more interest in his relationship with the US, he is facing corruption allegations and is currently under investigation for promoting a rather speculative crypto coin. Just after its launch, Milei posted about the LIBRA meme coin on X on the grounds that he wanted to support growing businesses and startups. His post quickly encouraged a price surge for the token, bringing its market valuation to over $4 billion. However, as traders started to withdraw their assets, the token collapsed, with analysts saying the coin showed all the signs of a rug pull. The LIBRA crypto scandal is now locally known as “cryptogate”, with a few influential characters involved, including a 28-year-old American entrepreneur who helped launch First Lady Melania Trump’s meme coin. Meanwhile, the libertarian president distanced himself from the crypto project soon after its dip, even deleting his initial X post, but he did ask the Justice Ministry’s Anti-Corruption Office to investigate the case. Milei and five more others, however, are currently under probe for creating and marketing the token and possible crimes of fraud, abuse of authority, and bribes.

In line with this, he revealed price levels to watch for as DOGE eyes a bullish breakout. Levels To Watch For As Dogecoin Price Confirms Final Retest In a TradingView post, Basic Trading highlighted $0.2, $0.5, and $5 as the levels to watch out for as the Dogecoin price confirms a final retest. This came as the analyst noted that market participants are about to witness a textbook ‘break and retest’ for Dogecoin. Alluding to the monthly chart, the analyst said that DOGE is obviously in an upward trend despite recent corrections. Related Reading: Dogecoin $10 Price Target Back In Play? Here’s What The Charts Say Basic Trading also remarked that the Dogecoin price has seen the expected correction of about 50% following its textbook retest of the previous all-time high about three months ago. The analyst is confident that the foremost meme coin is about to confirm the bullish break and retest, which would eventually lead to a parabolic rally and new highs. He predicts that DOGE will witness significant buy pressure, pushing the Dogecoin price to its current local high of around $0.5. This potential breakout would pave the way for a rally to a new ATH. Basic Trading believes that the foremost meme coin can rally to as high as $5 because of its performance in previous cycles. The analyst noted that the Dogecoin price enjoyed an 8,000% gain in the 2017 bull cycle and a 50,000% in the 2021 cycle. As such, he believes the $5 price level is a conservative target for DOGE in this bull run. Crypto analyst Dima Potts also recently predicted that Dogecoin could reach $10 in this cycle as it is mirroring a similar pattern from the 2017 bull cycle. $3 Remains A Strong Possibility For DOGE In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed how the Dogecoin price could rally to as high as $3 in this market cycle. He noted that the most critical support zone for DOGE is between $0.19 and $0.16. According to him, if this level holds, the $3 target remains a strong possibility for the foremost meme coin. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Knocks Off Second Major Correction, When Will The Recovery To $1 Resume? Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade also provided a bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price. In an X post, he stated that DOGE’s macro chart is showing a similar price pattern. The analyst remarked that if it mirrors the 2017 moves, DOGE could soon experience another massive surge. His accompanying chart showed that the meme coin could reach $1.7 when this massive surge happens.

The SOL token plunged to $160 this week, and is about to form the highly-risky death cross chart pattern on the daily chart. So, what next for Solana as market experts move to Minotaurus (MTAUR) ? Solana price forecast Solana, one of the biggest players in the crypto industry, has crashed into a bear market, falling from near $300 to $173. This coin has more downside as it is about to form a death cross pattern, which happens when the 200-day and 50-day moving averages flip each other. Solana also formed a double-top chart pattern at $264, and whose neckline was at $170. A double-top is one of the most bearish patterns in technical analysis. It has also moved below the Ichimoku cloud indicator. Additionally, Solana fell below the crucial ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since August 5 last year. Moving below that level is a sign that market participants expect it to crash much further in the next few months. Therefore, there is a likelihood that Solana price will drop to $110 in this bear market cycle. Such a crash would imply a 37% plunge from the current level. On the other hand, a move above the resistance level at $203, the 50-day moving average, will invalidate the bearish outlook. Why SOL price is imploding There are two main reasons why the Solana price is crashing. First, the drop happened because of the ongoing plunge of other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has dropped from $109,300 to $95,000, while most tokens like Cardano and Tron are in a steep bear market. Second, Solana has crashed because of the prevalence of meme coins in its ecosystem. Most of the recently launched meme coins have all plunged, costing many participants billions and making insiders millions. The best examples of this are Official Trump and Libra, which was promoted by Javier Milei. All this has led to concerns that Solana is a scam blockchain. It has also led to a sharp plunge of the volume handled by its DEX protocols. Experts flock to Minotaurus Crypto experts, fearful of the ongoing woes on Solana, have flocked to Minotaurus, an upcoming player in the gaming industry. Minotarus developers are creating a game that will be available on Android and iOS. It will be a simple-to-play game that millions of users are expected to enjoy. Minotaurus has already crossed the 1.75 million USDT mark in presale token sales in the past few weeks, and the momentum is gaining steam. This trajectory is happening because many of the participants know its potential. For one, it is in the blockchain and leisure gaming industry that has a total addressable market or TAM of over $50 billion.Participants are also buying the MTAUR token because of the promising upward path during presale. The MTAUR token is now priced at 0.00010518, much lower than the eventual listing price of 0.000200. Users also stand a chance to win big through the 100,000 USDT giveaway.
