40700758,https://coingape.com/?post_type=markets&p=240475,1740259728,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,PEPE Price Rebounds 6% as Analyst Predicts Ethereum Gains from Bybit Losses,https://coingape.com/markets/pepe-price-rebounds-6-as-analyst-predicts-ethereum-gains-from-bybit-losses/,"PEPE price surged 6%, defying market turmoil after Bybit’s $1.4 billion hack—could this be the start of a major rebound? PEPE rebounds 6% as traders bet on Ethereum gains from Bybit Hack PEPE suffered considerable losses on Friday, mirroring the $75 billion crypto market capitulation in the aftermath of the Bybit hack . The Bybit exploit, linked to the notorious Lazarus Group , saw the exchange lose over 400,000 ETH—worth approximately $1.4 billion at the time of the breach. Given that the stolen funds were in ETH, Ethereum-hosted assets like PEPE bore the brunt of the sell-off. PEPE’s price plummeted by 10% on Friday, while rival meme coins such as Dogecoin and Solana’s Dogwifhat (WIF) contained their losses below 5% in the immediate hours following the hack. PEPE Price Action, Feb 22, 2025 | Source: TradingView However, the broader crypto industry quickly rallied to provide support. Binance transferred over 50,000 ETH to Bybit, helping to stabilize liquidity for traders seeking withdrawals. Additionally, Bybit’s CEO reassured users about the safety of their funds. These interventions appear to have averted a systemic market collapse reminiscent of previous exchange mishaps, such as the FTX crash, which saw global crypto market capitalization shrink by nearly 50% within 10 days. However, 24 hours of the Bybit hack, PEPE price showed early signs of recovery, climbing 6% to reclaim the $0.00009 level at press time. Bulls bet $9M on PEPE rally as analysts hint at Ethereum buy-back to offset Bybit losses At press time, the Bybit exploit remains unresolved, with the stolen funds still sitting in a series of cold wallets identified by Arkham Intelligence. While Bybit’s security team collaborates with law enforcement agencies, speculation has emerged over how the exchange might recover the stolen assets. Some market analysts suggest that Bybit may be forced to repurchase the equivalent of the stolen ETH to reimburse customers and balance its books. Prominent analyst Ash Crypto echoed this view while alerting his 1.6 million followers on X (formerly Twitter) about the hack on Friday: “BYBIT hacker can’t sell $1.45 billion ETH for USDC or USDT because it will get frozen by Circle or Tether. So he just took $1.46 billion selling pressure from ETH. For BYBIT to cover customer ETH, they will have to buy $1.46 billion worth of ETH from (the) market.” — Ash Crypto, (Analyst) Feb. 21, 2025 With approximately 120 million ETH in circulation, the 400,000 ETH stolen from Bybit represents about 3% of total supply. If Bybit moves to repurchase the stolen ETH from the open market, it could significantly constrain available liquidity, potentially triggering a sharp price surge for Ethereum and other ecosystem tokens. Meanwhile, PEPE’s 6% price recovery appears to be bolstered by aggressive positioning in the derivatives market. Data from Coinglass, a leading on-chain analytics platform, suggests that strategic traders are already speculating on a continued rebound. PEPE Liquidation Map, Feb 22, 2025 | Coinglass Coinglass ’ liquidation heatmaps track the total capital deployed in leveraged long and short positions for specific assets, providing real-time insights into shifts in market sentiment. As the broader market stabilized, PEPE traders aggressively built up long positions. The latest data indicates that PEPE long positions have reached $9 million, significantly outpacing short positions at just $2.9 million—a disparity of nearly 70%. This substantial leverage gap implies that, as the market recovery unfolds, short traders may be reluctant to cover their positions, further fueling upside momentum. While PEPE remains below the $0.000010 threshold and has yet to fully erase its 10% losses from the Friday crash, the growing long interest suggests sustained bullish momentum in the days ahead. If Ethereum’s price action strengthens due to anticipated buy-backs, PEPE’s recovery phase could gain additional traction, positioning it for further upside. PEPE Price Forecast: Close Above $0.000011 Could Kickstart Recovery Phase PEPE price forecast suggests an emerging recovery phase as the Ethereum-hosted memecoin rebounds 6% following Friday’s sharp drop triggered by the Bybit hack. The chart shows a notable shift in momentum, with PEPE rising above the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) at $0.00000948, indicating that recent buyers have been willing to pay slightly higher prices to secure their positions. This suggests competitive demand, with traders positioning ahead of a potential full recovery to pre-Bybit crash levels. PEPE Price Forecast The daily candlestick structure presents a mixed outlook. The lower Bollinger Band has provided dynamic support, preventing deeper declines, while PEPE’s latest green candle signals an early attempt at a trend reversal. However, a confirmed breakout above the upper Donchian Channel resistance at $0.00001144 is crucial to sustain a bullish continuation. A close above this level could accelerate momentum, driving prices toward the $0.00001200 resistance. On the downside, failure to hold above VWAP could invite another wave of selling, potentially retesting Friday’s lows near $0.00000796. The volume delta remains negative overall, suggesting sellers are still present, but the uptick in green bars during the daily time frame signals a bump in PEPE spot market liquidity as buying interest gradually returns. If bulls maintain dominance in the derivatives markets, PEPE could regain lost ground, solidifying its recovery phase.

Kanye West announced that he will launch his own token next week. However, in his previous statements, he said that all tokens were for the purpose of scamming his followers and declared that he would never release a token. On the other hand, there may be an unusual partnership in the memecoin that West will launch. West retweeted Binance founder Changpeng Zhao’s tweet that “decentralized exchanges are very hard to use.” In addition, it is noteworthy that the only person West, who has 33 million followers, follows on Twitter is Changpeng Zhao.

VanEck Research Weighs In,https://thecoinrise.com/can-bitcoin-pay-off-u-s-debt-vaneck-research-weighs-in/,"The idea of using Bitcoin to reduce the U.S. national debt has been making headlines, especially in President Donald Trump’s speech at the Nashville Bitcoin Conference in July 2024. Following his remarks, the US. Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced a bill proposing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. She said the bill was proposed to help cut down the country’s massive debt. As reported by Crypto.News, a new report from VanEck, an investment management firm, sheds light on whether this plan is feasible. What VanEck’s Research Says According to VanEck’s latest findings, the U.S. government would need to buy one million bitcoins over the next five years and hold them for 20 years. If this plan goes ahead, by 2049, the total value of these bitcoins could reach around $21 trillion. However, this would only cover approximately 18% of the national debt, which is expected to hit $116 trillion by then. It was stated in the report that to achieve these figures, Bitcoin’s price would need to grow at an average rate of 25% per year, eventually reaching $21 billion per coin. Meanwhile, the national debt is projected to rise by 5% annually. While Bitcoin has seen much growth in the past, there is no guarantee it will maintain this pace for the next two decades. In addition, the report mentioned that the acquisition of one million bitcoins would bring about many challenges. This is because the total supply of Bitcoin is currently capped at 21 million. So, any attempts at large government purchases could drive up prices. This will make acquisitions more expensive. Could Bitcoin Ever Erase U.S. Debt? Despite rumors that Bitcoin could wipe out U.S. debt, VanEck’s research suggests otherwise. Paying off the entire debt would require over five million bitcoins at today’s projected growth rates. However, since only 21 million bitcoins exist, this is simply impossible. Furthermore, even if Bitcoin reached $1 million per coin, the U.S. government would still need 36 million bitcoins to clear its debt. On top of that, selling such a massive amount would likely crash the market, further diminishing the value of the reserves. Bitcoin as a Partial Solution While Bitcoin could contribute to debt reduction, it is far from a complete solution. As Senator Lummis initially stated, the aim is to reduce debt, not eliminate it. VanEck’s research supports this perspective, showing that while a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve might help, it is not a magic fix. Since Senator Lummis introduced the bill, several state lawmakers across the U.S. have been considering similar proposals for Bitcoin reserves. For instance, Utah’s Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Bill recently passed the House with an 8-1 vote and is now under review by the Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee. Also, other states, including Florida, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Oklahoma, have also moved to establish Bitcoin reserves. The post Can Bitcoin Pay Off U.S. Debt?

In Berkshire Hathaway’s annual letter to shareholders, Buffett warns the stability and purchasing power of the US dollar can be easily eroded. “Paper money can see its value evaporate if fiscal folly prevails. In some countries, this reckless practice has become habitual, and, in our country’s short history, the U.S. has come close to the edge. Fixed-coupon bonds provide no protection against runaway currency.” Buffett says capitalism itself is suffering from historic levels of abuse within the system, although its power to promote prosperity remains unmatched. “One way or another, the sensible – better yet imaginative – deployment of savings by citizens is required to propel an ever-growing societal output of desired goods and services. This system is called capitalism. It has its faults and abuses – in certain respects more egregious now than ever – but it also can work wonders unmatched by other economic systems… The American process has not always been pretty – our country has forever had many scoundrels and promoters who seek to take advantage of those who mistakenly trust them with their savings. But even with such malfeasance – which remains in full force today – and also much deployment of capital that eventually floundered because of brutal competition or disruptive innovation, the savings of Americans has delivered a quantity and quality of output beyond the dreams of any colonist.” The 94 year-old Berkshire Hathaway CEO says it won’t be long before he ends his historic 60-year tenure at the firm. “At 94, it won’t be long before Greg Abel replaces me as CEO and will be writing the annual letters… We are impartial in our choice of equity vehicles, investing in either variety based upon where we can best deploy your (and my family’s) savings. Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities.

Analys Weigh In,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/could-this-0-00020-token-eclipse-solana-and-ripples-early-success-analys-weigh-in/,"As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve in 2025, THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN has emerged as a potential game-changer, currently priced at $0.20. This Trump-inspired memecoin has captured significant attention, raising over $3 million in its presale phase. To understand its potential, let’s compare it to the early success stories of Solana and Ripple, two established players in the crypto space. Historical Growth Analysis: Solana (SOL) Solana has been a solid performer in the crypto landscape, known for its high-speed transactions and low fees. Its dual-layer consensus system, combining Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of History (PoH), allows for high throughput and low latency. This technological edge has made Solana a preferred platform for DeFi, NFT marketplaces, and gaming applications. Solana’s growth has been impressive, with its price reaching $219.47 and a 24-hour trading volume of $3.25 billion. The network’s ability to handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) under optimal conditions has positioned it as a strong competitor in the high-throughput blockchain space. Historical Growth Analysis: Ripple (XRP) Ripple has focused on revolutionizing cross-border payments, partnering with over 300 financial institutions globally. Its XRP Ledger processes 1,500 TPS, with transactions settling in 3-5 seconds at a cost of around $0.0002 per transaction. Despite facing regulatory challenges, including an ongoing legal battle with the SEC, Ripple has maintained its position as a leader in the payments sector. The outcome of its legal issues could significantly impact its adoption within institutional finance. THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN: The Trending Memecoin Set To Explode ACT FAST! USE PROMO CODE MAGA50X NOW AND CLAIM YOUR 50% EXTRA BONUS! THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN has shown remarkable potential, with its presale raising $3,076,115.19. Currently priced at $0.0001978 per token, it’s set to list at $0.007, indicating substantial growth potential. Key factors driving THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN’s potential include: A limited supply of 100 billion tokens, creating scarcity Strong community backing with over 60,000 supporters Unique blend of political branding and crypto innovation Analysts predict that THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN could reach $1 in 2025, potentially delivering significant returns for early investors. Comparative Market Potential While Solana and Ripple have established themselves in specific niches – Solana in high-performance blockchain applications and Ripple in cross-border payments – THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN is positioning itself as a community-driven, politically charged token with broad appeal. The current market environment, characterized by increasing regulatory clarity and institutional adoption, could benefit all three tokens. However, MAGACOIN’s unique positioning and viral potential could lead to explosive growth similar to or surpassing the early days of Solana and Ripple. Don’t Miss the Rise of THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN – Invest at $0.00020 Today! THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN presents a unique opportunity in the evolving crypto landscape of 2025. With its strong community support, limited supply, and potential for viral growth, it could eclipse the early success of both Solana and Ripple. The token’s current price of $0.20 offers an attractive entry point for investors seeking high-growth potential.

SHIB’s technical indicators have analysts debating a potential rally, while LTC is navigating a key price point. BlockDAG, having raised over $197 million and sold 18.5 billion coins in its presale, is making waves in the Web3 space, attracting a massive influx of developer talent through its HackerEarth partnership. This article explores these exciting developments, providing insights into the Shiba Inu breakout forecast, Litecoin’s potential, and BlockDAG’s ambitious vision for the future of decentralized technology. Shiba Inu Breakout Forecast: A 23% Surge on the Horizon? The Shiba Inu breakout forecast is a major topic among traders following the coin’s earlier price climb. A subsequent dip has raised questions about the forecast’s validity. However, some technical observers highlight a golden cross formation on the daily chart, a potentially bullish signal. The Shiba Inu breakout forecast also considers a key Fibonacci retracement level where the coin found support. A prior golden cross event led to a substantial price increase, prompting speculation about a possible 23% rally. The Shiba Inu breakout forecast is being closely watched by many in the crypto community. Litecoin Price Trends: Targeting $140 and Beyond? The Litecoin (LTC) price prediction is attracting attention as the coin holds above $126, a level some view as a springboard for further gains. Some analysts suggest that breaking through this resistance could propel LTC toward $140 or higher, particularly given improving market sentiment related to regulatory clarity. Expert LTC price predictions point to potential higher targets if trading volume remains robust. However, mixed indicators have led to some caution among traders. A symmetrical triangle pattern on daily charts adds to the uncertainty. Upcoming ETF news could also impact Litecoin’s outlook, with the possibility of reaching $200 if conditions are favorable. BlockDAG x HackerEarth: Building the Next Generation of Web3 BlockDAG’s partnership with HackerEarth is creating significant excitement. By hosting global hackathons, BlockDAG is engaging over 10,000 developers. This initiative highlights BlockDAG’s commitment to building a vibrant Web3 ecosystem. With over $197 million raised and 18.5 billion coins sold, BlockDAG’s presale is demonstrating incredible momentum. Early participants have seen substantial returns, and there is talk of even greater returns in the future. These hackathons are not just for show. BlockDAG aims to be the leading developer-friendly Layer 1 platform, facilitating the creation of over 200 new Web3 projects across various sectors. This focus on developer engagement is expected to drive innovation, resulting in dApps tailored to specific markets and industries. BlockDAG’s leadership emphasizes the crucial role of the HackerEarth partnership in attracting top-tier talent. Localized events ensure that developers from all regions have the chance to contribute to the Web3 revolution. BlockDAG’s presale success reflects the project’s growing community and potential for mainstream adoption. With its focus on scalability, developer experience, and real-world applications, BlockDAG is positioning itself as a key player in the blockchain arena. A Quick Recap Traders are carefully observing market trends, including the Shiba Inu breakout forecast. The coin’s earlier price surge has sparked discussions about the potential for another upward move. Litecoin’s price prediction is also in focus as the coin consolidates above a key level, with analysts speculating about a push toward higher targets. BlockDAG’s collaboration with HackerEarth is expected to accelerate Web3 development.

Franklin Templeton’s Franklin Crypto Index ETF (EZPZ) has attracted around $2.5 million in net assets since launching on Feb. 20, while Hashdex’s Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF (NCIQ) has gathered just over $1 million since its Feb. 14 debut. By comparison, Franklin Templeton’s spot Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) saw significantly higher interest, pulling in approximately $50 million on its first day in January 2024, with Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) reaching nearly $240 million on its debut. Diversification Limits and Regulatory Barriers The two ETFs aim to provide investors with exposure to a diverse crypto index. However, due to regulatory restrictions, they currently hold only Bitcoin and Ether, which dominate their portfolios. The hope is to expand to other cryptocurrencies pending regulatory approval.

According to data provided by Binance and analyzed by CryptoQuant, the number of Binance Pay users tripled from the previous year, reaching 41.7 million. This rapid adoption highlights the increasing role of crypto in everyday transactions. Stablecoins Lead the Charge The total transaction volume processed through Binance Pay in 2024 stood at $72.4 billion, the report found. This is a notable rise from $2.5 billion in 2021. Stablecoins, particularly Tether (USDT), dominated Binance Pay transactions as it accounted for 80% of the total payment volume, which equated to $57 billion. Top crypto assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Binance Coin (BNB) followed suit, contributing $6.6 billion, $2.4 billion, and $2.2 billion, respectively, and represented 9%, 3%, and 3% of the total transaction value. Another popular stablecoin, USD Coin (USDC), exhibited notable year-over-year growth, with a 1,338% increase in transaction count and a 48% rise in transaction volume. Broader market trends indicate a rise in high-frequency token transactions on Binance Pay, with Solana (SOL) leading the surge. In fact, CryptoQuant found that SOL payments reached $724 million in 2024 and represented a 656% year-over-year increase. During the same period, Bitcoin transactions rose by 73% to $6.6 billion, while Ethereum payments grew by 69% to $2.4 billion. USDC and BNB also recorded notable growth, increasing by 48% and 29%, respectively. Binance Pay’ s expansion aligns with the overall growth of the crypto market and Binance’s increasing role in facilitating transactions. This trend is further validated by a significant rise in Binance’s cryptocurrency reserves. The USD value of its Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, and USDC reserves exceeded $100 billion in 2024, marking a 137% increase from the start of the year when reserves stood at $43 billion. The increasing use of Binance Pay reflects a larger global trend as cryptocurrency ownership continues to rise. Crypto Adoption Global cryptocurrency ownership witnessed a 13% increase in 2024, rising from 583 million in January to 659 million in December, according to a report by Crypto.com. Bitcoin ownership grew by 13.1%, reaching 337 million users and accounting for over 51% of all crypto owners. Ethereum saw a 13.6% increase, with owners rising from 125 million to 142 million, and represented 21.7% of global ownership. Additionally, between 300,000 and 1.2 million people may have invested in BTC through US spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Institutional interest and pro-crypto policies from US President-elect Donald Trump were major factors driving BTC adoption. The report observed that ETH’s growth was fueled by Ethereum Layer 2 network rallies following the Dencun upgrade and the launch of spot Ethereum ETFs, which contributed to increased investor participation.

If this happens, we could see XRP usage skyrocket as more financial institutions jump on board, which might drive up its price significantly – we’ll check it out in detail below. While XRP is bringing changes in traditional finance, PlutoChain could bring new functionalities in the Bitcoin space. Their hybrid L2 technology could give Bitcoin’s ecosystem a serious upgrade in the coming weeks. Let’s check out the details. XRP Price Prediction: Japanese Banks’ XRP Adoption Could Signal Major Price Movement – Is $10 on the Horizon? Japan’s financial sector might be on the verge of a major shift toward XRP adoption. SBI Group’s leader Yoshitaka Kitao envisions XRP revolutionizing how Japan’s migrant workers send money home, making transfers faster and cheaper. Industry insiders suggest a massive wave of adoption is building, with potentially 80% of Japanese banks considering XRP integration. This could dramatically boost both trading activity and market liquidity as banks tap into XRP for international transfers. The ripple effect could spread beyond Japan’s borders – if other Asian financial hubs follow suit, we might see unprecedented demand for XRP. Market analyst Farshad Rouhani has set an ambitious target, suggesting XRP could break $10 in early 2025 as Japanese banks roll out XRP-based payment systems. PlutoChain’s Hybrid Layer-2 Solution Could Transform Bitcoin’s Ecosystem Bitcoin continues to face challenges with its core infrastructure – users often encounter lengthy transaction times, high fees, and network bottlenecks that could limit its mainstream adoption. These scaling issues might become even more pressing as usage grows. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could offer a solution through its hybrid Layer-2 architecture that potentially works in parallel with Bitcoin’s main chain. By redirecting transaction traffic to its network, PlutoChain might significantly reduce fees and ease congestion, while potentially solving Bitcoin’s long-standing scalability challenges. The speed difference could be transformative. While Bitcoin typically requires 10 minutes to process blocks, trailing behind networks like Ethereum and Solana, PlutoChain’s Layer-2 solution might achieve block times of approximately 2 seconds. This improvement could enable faster smart contract execution while maintaining the robust security guarantees of Bitcoin’s network. A key feature of PlutoChain is its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. This feature could create a bridge between Bitcoin and the vast ecosystem of Ethereum-based applications. Projects focused on decentralized finance, NFT marketplaces, and emerging AI applications might soon flourish within Bitcoin’s ecosystem, potentially breathing new life into the network. Early performance indicators appear promising – testnet results show PlutoChain could process up to 43,200 transactions per day without experiencing slowdowns, suggesting robust scalability potential. Security is important in PlutoChain’s development approach. The project has undergone comprehensive audits from respected firms including SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi . Regular stress testing could help ensure the network maintains reliability even under heavy load conditions. Community governance stands as another cornerstone of the project. Through its decentralized governance model, PlutoChain could empower users to actively participate in the network’s evolution. Community members might propose changes and vote on crucial protocol decisions, potentially creating a more democratic and user-driven development process. The Bottom Line XRP’s momentum in Japanese banking could drive major price movements, while PlutoChain could gain traction as a potential upgrade in the Bitcoin ecosystem. By tackling Bitcoin’s core challenges with its hybrid Layer-2 solution, this project might revolutionize how we use the world’s largest digital asset – potentially offering faster transactions and lower fees while maintaining Bitcoin’s legendary security. ——- The information in this article does not represent financial or investment advice.

Their discussion about a potential national XRP reserve has ignited speculation – could this be the catalyst to propel XRP to $30? Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could be interesting to watch because of its innovative hybrid Layer-2 solution for Bitcoin. Designed to tackle Bitcoin’s long-standing issues like sluggish transaction speeds and limited scalability, this project could redefine Bitcoin as we know it. Let’s check out the details. XRP Is Showing Great Potential For a $30 Rally – What Are Analysts Saying? XRP is making noise in the crypto community with whispers of a potential $30 price surge, fueled by reported discussions between Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and President Donald Trump. It’s currently trading at $2.73 showing great potential for a breakout, and this high-profile chatter could be the match to light the fuse. XRP 7-day chart, Source: Binance Technically, XRP’s flexing strength, sitting below the 200-day EMA – a bullish bedrock. Resistance at $2.65 and $3.00 is in its crosshairs, and the RSI at 36 approaching oversold territory, a potential short-term bounce. The volume’s simmered to $4.2 billion daily from January’s $10 billion peak, but a Trump-Ripple bombshell could unleash a torrent of buying. A bullish pennant on the daily chart screams breakout potential – $3.66 could fall fast, paving the way to double digits. Historically, XRP thrives on regulatory clarity; a friendly nod from Trump could mirror 2017’s epic rally . Analysts are all-in on this bullish wave. DeepSeek AI model predicts that XRP could skyrocket to $30 in 2025, driven by increased institutional adoption and potential market share in global foreign exchange. On the other hand, CoinCodex experts indicate that XRP could reach as high as $4.24 by April 2025, based on historical data and market trends – significantly lower than the previous prediction but still promising. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Could Transform Bitcoin Into a Hub For Development and Innovation – New Layer-2 Blockchain Offers Smart Contracts and EVM Compatibility PlutoChain ($PLUTO) emerges as a hybrid Layer-2 blockchain with the potential to redefine Bitcoin’s role in the crypto ecosystem. Unlike Bitcoin’s base layer, which excels in security but lags in speed, this project could deliver an impressive upgrade. It offers a block time of 2 seconds compared to Bitcoin’s standard 10 minutes and scales to handle over 43,200 transactions per day, per testnet results. This leap in performance could position Bitcoin as a dynamic platform, not just a passive asset, appealing to enthusiasts eager for broader utility. Developers stand at the forefront of this shift. PlutoChain equips Bitcoin with smart contracts, unlocking the ability to build sophisticated decentralized applications directly on its network. Its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility adds another layer of appeal, enabling developers to seamlessly adapt Ethereum projects for Bitcoin’s infrastructure. This cross-chain potential could streamline workflows and inspire novel solutions, while users benefit from swift, low-fee transactions and access to innovative tools, all underpinned by Bitcoin’s reliability. For the DeFi community, PlutoChain offers a fresh angle. Bitcoin’s DeFi footprint remains minimal next to Ethereum’s and Solana’s. By weaving DeFi capabilities into Bitcoin, such as lending protocols and liquidity pools, PlutoChain could elevate and potentially challenge Ethereum or Solana’s established networks. Security holds firm as a cornerstone. PlutoChain has cleared audits from respected names like SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi , validating its technical integrity. Beyond that, its decentralized governance structure invites community members to shape the project’s future through Discord -based voting, ensuring decisions reflect community priorities and maintain accountability. PlutoChain’s vision taps into Bitcoin’s untapped potential, blending speed, scalability, and programmability. It hands developers a powerful canvas to innovate and users a more versatile network to explore. Conclusion XRP’s potential surge to $30 is gaining traction following discussions between Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Donald Trump, with speculation around a national XRP reserve adding fuel to the rally. Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could expand Bitcoin’s capabilities with its hybrid Layer-2 solution, enabling smart contracts, faster transactions, and DeFi integration. By merging Bitcoin’s security with Ethereum-like functionality, it could lead the way in the blockchain industry. ——- Please keep in mind that this article is not financial advice.

40702703,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=680672,1740262834,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40702703.jpeg,mETH Protocol and Tether lead campaign to freeze Bybit hacker’s bounty,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/meth-protocol-tether-freeze-bybit-hackers/,"The cryptocurrency space was ripe for a black swan event, and one promptly presented itself with the $1.4 billion Bybit hack. However, unlike previous debacles that led to near-total collapses, the industry has managed this episode fairly well—further highlighting the maturity of the digital asset space. In what many are calling the biggest crypto hack of all time, Bybit lost more than $1.4 billion in ETH and stETH early Friday. An investigation is ongoing, however, according to prominent on-chain sleuth ZachXBT, it is highly likely North Korea’s Lazarus group was behind the hack thanks to patterns consistent with their MO. After news of the hack spread, there was initial panic in the markets as Bybit users rushed to get their funds off the CEX, reminded all too well of how FTX folded following a series of panic withdrawals. Fortunately, it did not take long for order to be restored, and the crypto community has shown its resilience and togetherness after the early sensationalism that followed the big headline. mETH protocol joins Binance, others in supporting Bybit Shortly after news got out about the hack, mETH Protocol, a decentralized, permissionless platform built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to stake their ETH and receive liquid staking tokens, known as mETH, released a post-mortem of the hack. The report revealed that the attacker executed multiple transactions to move assets off the platform. According to mETH’s report, 8,000 mETH were swapped for ETH across three transactions via a DEX, and a 15,000 cmETH withdrawal was initiated via mETH Protocol. However, it did not allow the hackers to complete the transaction. The hackers would have gotten away with the funds if not for the protocol’s security measures, which include an 8-hour withdrawal delay built into the protocol to prevent the immediate withdrawal of cmETH. The protocol also blacklisted the exploiter’s address, reducing the cmETH liquidity on Mantle Network and the recovery of about 15,000 cmETH from the exploiter’s address to a recovery address, reinstating the integrity of cmETH supply. Aside from the mETH Protocol, other notable groups in crypto that have stepped up to help include Binance and Tether. On Friday, Paolo Ardoino, the CEO of Tether, revealed his firm had frozen $181,000 worth of the UDST linked to the stolen Bybit funds, thanks to the help of ZachXBT. “Might not be much but it’s honest work,” Ardoino wrote on X. “We keep monitoring.” On Binance’s part, it chose to provide a bridge loan to Bybit so that it can continue to process client withdrawals without delay, ensuring that users can access their funds despite the hack. Bitget has also provided a 64,452 ETH loan to Bybit, and MEXC transferred 12,652 stETH to Bybit’s cold wallet as a sign of solidarity. By now, it is clear that Bybit has weathered the storm from the attack. Following the breach, the firm confirmed that withdrawals were still active but warned that some users might experience delays due to network congestion. Despite the warning, Bybit was able to process 70% of the withdrawal requests successfully, and efforts are underway to address the remaining backlog. Now that the worst has passed, the company is focusing on recovery. On Saturday, Bybit stated it would offer 10% of recovered funds—up to $140 million—to any on-chain security experts who could help the firm get the stolen assets back. In a statement, Bybit co-founder and CEO Ben Zhou highlighted the show of solidarity from the space and promised it was not taken for granted. “We have shared in a dark moment of crypto history, and we’ve proven we are better than the malicious actors,” Zhou said. “We want to officially reward our community who lent us their expertise, experience, and support through the Recovery Bounty Program, and our efforts to make this difficult lesson a valuable one does not stop here.” Ben also noted that the hackers are moving some of the funds to Chainflip.io as a bridge to convert into BTC. He shared an SOS to any bridges with the capacity to freeze or even recover the funds stolen from his exchange, saying “If you are a bridge, Please help us to block and prevent further conversion to other chains.” Projects that have the potential to join the asset-freezing effort According to reports, most of the stolen funds are in native Ethereum, which is not easy to recover since it lacks a centralized freezing mechanism. About 8,000–15,000 mETH and approximately 181,000 USDT were also stolen. While Bybit pursues justice, onlookers have urged more entities currently sitting on the sidelines to join the effort by freezing the assets of the hackers. Some other projects people are expecting to take action include Lido (stETH) and Ethereum (ETH). Lido is a major liquid staking protocol and the issuer of stETH (Staked ETH). It could help by blacklisting stETH addresses, but this might only happen if it is pressured by Bybit or regulators. Also, its decentralized nature makes swift action less likely unless the effort is spearheaded by exchanges or law enforcement. While native ETH cannot be frozen by a single entity because of the chain’s decentralization, a hard fork or rollback could in theory invalidate the stolen funds. This was done once in 2016 when there was a DAO hack. It would require consensus from miners, nodes, and the community. While thought leaders like Arthur Hayes have been talking about the possibility of an Ethereum rollback, given the hack’s scale, there has been no official announcement, and the community’s willingness to do such a thing is uncertain. If there is no overwhelming support from the community, a rollback is unlikely to happen, and blacklisting at the protocol level isn’t feasible, although exchanges could tag and block exploiter addresses. Should the hackers also make the mistake of swapping the stolen ETH into other ERC-20 tokens like USDC, those projects have the ability to freeze funds as long as their contracts permit it. Circle (USDC) has been known to freeze stolen funds in the past, however in those cases, significant USDC had been lost. That is not the case this time. Some analysts are convinced the hackers will eventually convert the ETH to ERC-20 tokens before moving it to BTC and finally fiat via Asian exchanges.

Although it has a current price of $176 , according to CoinGecko, experts say this rise might happen as a result of USD/GBP exchange rates shift. Investors are watching closely because these currency changes can influence SOL’s growth. Meanwhile, Panshibi , a new meme coin, shines as a top crypto pick. Its presale, with only 30 days left, has already raised over $1,000,000. This article explores how USD/GBP fluctuations will push SOL’s price and why Panshibi is gaining attention in the cryptocurrency world today. USD/GBP Swings Push SOL Toward $375 Milestone Based on data from CoinMarketcap , Solana (SOL) trades at approximately $176 on February 21, 2025. Now, experts predict it could reach $375 soon due to the influence of swings in the USD/GBP exchange rate. The rate compares the US dollar to the British pound and its changes affect cryptocurrency prices globally. When the USD strengthens against the GBP, crypto often becomes more appealing to investors using pounds, boosting demand for coins like SOL. SOL’s price has been steady, hovering between $170 and $200 over the past week, with a market cap of about $85.57 billion . Its blockchain is known for fast transactions up to 65,000 per second and low fees of $0.0025 per transaction on an average, according to Solana’s official site. These strengths make it a top crypto pick among developers and investors, supporting its growth. Also, some analysts have noted SOL’s potential to double in value soon, driven by these currency dynamics and its solid technology. Unlike some coins, SOL’s rise is backed by real use in decentralized apps and finance. However, the market remains unpredictable. If the USD/GBP stabilizes, SOL’s climb might slow. Still, with its current trajectory and global economic factors at play, reaching $375 seems within reach. Investors are keeping a close eye on exchange rates, knowing they could push SOL, a top crypto pick even higher in the coming weeks. Panshibi’s Final 30 Days: A Rising Star in Crypto Panshibi, a new meme coin, is in the spotlight as a top crypto pick with just 30 days left in its presale as of February 22, 2025. It has raised over $1,000,000 at stage 4 of the presale with a token price of $0.005. This success shows strong interest from investors. Unlike many meme coins, Panshibi blends fun with real utility, offering AI features and Social-Fi rewards. The coin’s appeal comes from its community focus and unique design. Panshibi is set to offer a 1200% increase during its presale and a 145,000% increase after its launch. This has attracted investors who want profit and stability. It also plans to list on major exchanges, boosting its visibility. With 720 million tokens in the presale already and a total supply of 1.2 billion, Panshibi allows investors to become early adopters. Since meme coins often rely on hype, Panshibi’s mix of innovation, tech and community sets it apart. Now, the final 30 days are critical. Early buyers could see big returns if it follows the path of coins like Shiba Inu, which soared after launch. With strong backing and a clear plan, Panshibi is set to be the top crypto pick for 2025. Conclusion Solana’s push toward $375 reflects how USD/GBP swings shape the crypto market. On other news, Panshibi emerges as a top crypto pick with its presale nearing its end with less than 30 days left. After the launch, Panshibi will list on Uniswap and multiple CEXs. Don’t miss out on this lifetime opportunity, join Panshibi’s presale now and be part of its innovation before it’s too late.

With a growing community, strategic tokenomics, and expanding utility, Pepeto stands out in a crowded market. Dogecoin Set the Standard #Dogecoin started as a joke but became a pioneer in the meme coin sector. Dogecoin attained widespread mainstream popularity because it developed both a powerful community structure and high levels of virality. Over time, Dogecoin gained utility through tipping, payments, and integrations with major businesses. The coin’s duration demonstrates that meme coins can endure longer than momentary speculation. Influential figures, including Elon Musk, contributed to Dogecoin growth. Despite its initial playful nature, Dogecoin remains a key player in the crypto space. Pepe Followed with a Fresh Approach The new investor base came to market through #Pepe because it incorporated contemporary meme-based design elements. Young investors received exposure to Pepe through their engagement with online communities and viral marketing. Users interested in Pepe pursued its deflationary framework because it presented investment benefits that were dissimilar to those of Dogecoin. These developments demonstrated how internet culture defines the future of meme coins as an investment opportunity. The market saw potential in Pepe, which led investors to value it significantly high. Pepe’s success confirmed that meme cryptocurrency investments survive through distinctive branding and restricted token availability mechanisms. Pepeto Leads with Innovation and Utility #Pepeto takes meme coins further by combining strong branding with real-world use cases.

DOGE meme coin eyes breakout as SEC reviews spot ETF filing Dogecoin (DOGE) is approaching a critical juncture, with technical indicators pointing to a potential 25% breakout. A symmetrical triangle pattern on the 1-hour chart suggests Dogecoin’s price is consolidating, preparing for a significant move. Analysts are closely watching whether Dogecoin surges higher or faces another downturn. According to Crypto Analyst Ali Martinez, the symmetrical triangle signals an impending breakout as Dogecoin’s price squeezes between trendlines. Meanwhile, the SEC has acknowledged Grayscale’s filing for a spot Dogecoin ETF, marking the beginning of its review process. If approved, the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust could bring Dogecoin to mainstream investment markets. The DOGE meme coin trades at $0.26, and analysts expect a rally to $1. Dogecoin is still a top crypto contender with growing institutional interest and technical momentum building. Dogwifhat (WIF) struggles below $1 after 87% drop Dogwifhat (WIF) was among the best cryptos to perform during the last market cycle, advancing 3,000% to an all-time high in March 2024. Dogwifhat was the largest meme coin in the Solana ecosystem and rapidly grew well-known, but it is now not among the top 100 cryptocurrencies. The downturn began in November 2024 and extended into 2025, with Dogwifhat plummeting 87% from its peak. On Feb. 3, 2025, Dogwifhat hit a low of $0.55 and struggled to recover. Currently, Dogwifhat trades at $0.60, sitting below the crucial $1 threshold needed to trigger bullish momentum. Despite its decline, Dogwifhat remains a key player in Solana’s meme coin sector. Analysts suggest that a break back above $1 could reignite investor interest, but until then, Dogwifhat faces an uncertain path in the volatile crypto market. 1Fuel (OFT): Cross-chain trading, AI tools, and exclusive bonuses 1Fuel (OFT) is transforming decentralized trading with its cross-chain compatibility, allowing seamless transactions across multiple blockchains.

However, this bullish dream ended almost immediately after it started as nearly $1.5 billion worth of ETH tokens were drained from the ByBit exchange. Ethereum, which traded as high as $2,840 earlier on Friday, February 21, dropped towards $2,600 on the back of news of the ByBit hack. Interestingly, recent on-chain data suggests that the altcoin’s price could still make its way to $4,000 before the end of this cycle. Could ETH Price Still Record A 60% Rally This Cycle? In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, an analyst with the pseudonym Crypto Sunmoon identified a particular bullish divergence that offers insight into the Ethereum price performance in the near future. This bullish observation is based on recent movements of ETH’s “taker buy/sell ratio” across all exchanges. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price On The Edge: Breakout Or Breakdown—What’s Next? This metric measures the taker buy and taker sell volumes for a specific cryptocurrency (Ethereum, in this case). When the taker buy/sell ratio is greater than one, it implies that the taker buy volume is higher than the taker sell volume. This is typically considered a bullish signal, indicating the willingness of investors to pay a higher price for an asset. On the contrary, a less-than-one taker buy/sell ratio indicates that sellers are overwhelming the buyers in the market. This scenario suggests that more sellers are willing to offload their assets at a lower price, signaling a bearish shift in investor sentiment. Crypto Sunmoon noted that the 100-day exponential moving average (EMA) of the Ethereum taker buy/sell ratio on all exchanges has been rising in recent weeks. The Ethereum price, on the other hand, has been declining since mid-December. According to the analyst, this divergence is positive, as it indicates that a bearish trend has ended and an upward trend could be starting. The last time this bullish divergence occurred, the Ethereum price traveled from beneath $2,500 to above $4,000 (over 60% rally). While investors would view a reclaim of $3,000 as a victory for Ethereum, history and this bullish divergence suggest that the altcoin’s price could still climb toward the $4,000 mark before the end of the current cycle. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Ethereum stands around $2,650, reflecting a nearly 4% decline in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: More Pain Ahead For Solana?

In what he categorized as the ELI5 explainer to non-technical community members, Beiko explained why a rollback is impossible. Historical Trend Behind Chain Rollback The conversations around potential Ethereum rollback followed the $1.4 billion Bybit hack . With over 401,000 ETH siphoned on-chain, top industry leaders are now advocating for a chain halt to reverse the transactions. According to Tim Beiko on X , the rollback trend is not a new trend. He returned to memory lane, noting that they started with Bitcoin in 2010. At the time, a client software minted 184 billion Bitcoins in block 74638. At the time, it was easy for Satoshi Nakamoto to deploy a software patch to address the bug. Also, TheDAO, an Ethereum protocol, suffered a hack in which bad actors siphoned approximately 15% of all ETH it had in custody. Luckily, at the time, there was a fail-safe system where funds withdrawn were frozen for 30 days before access was granted. This allowed the Ethereum developers to rollback the chain, creating a new chain. Tim Beiko noted that the updated chain at the time became Ethereum, while the old chain remained Ethereum Classic. Why is Ethereum Rollback Impossible? In justifying why it is impossible to reverse the transactions on the Ethereum Block that led to the hack, Beiko pointed out the complexity of the current ETH chain. Unlike Bitcoin in 2010, which had limited adoption and a price of $0.07, Ethereum powers real-world economic transactions. The researcher said attempting to roll back the transaction will significantly affect the ecosystem. In addition, he noted that the Lazarus Group behind the hack had moved the Ethereum funds, aligning with earlier reports. Unlike TheDAO, Beiko pointed out the complications in rolling back these transactions. Lastly, he identified the opposition to the rollback of Ethereum in 2018 in a situation related to Parity’s multisig wallet. Despite the over 500,000 Ethereum involved in the case, developers within the ecosystem did not agree to the move. The Ethereum Pectra Upgrade Challenge While Tim Beiko did not highlight this, the protocol is expecting the Pectra upgrade to launch in April. This upgrade, which has been under development for over a year, is set to enter the testing phase in the coming week. Some experts are concerned that the chain rollback plans may also impact the Pectra upgrade. The Ethereum network roadmap is on track; however, industry backlash on the siphoned funds has yet to be resolved.

Ripple (XRP) has long been a key player in cross-border transactions, gaining institutional adoption despite regulatory uncertainties. However, new projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are emerging with strong utility and fresh opportunities, drawing attention from early investors. Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a major force in decentralized finance (DeFi), offering a lending platform where users can supply assets, borrow funds, and earn passive income. Unlike XRP, which is primarily focused on payments, MUTM brings a self-sustaining ecosystem with real financial applications. With over $1 million raised in its presale and Phase 1 nearly sold out, analysts are beginning to view Mutuum Finance as a high-upside opportunity with strong fundamentals backing its long-term growth. Ripple (XRP) XRP has remained a strong contender in the crypto market, largely due to its role in facilitating fast and low-cost cross-border transactions. Its adoption among financial institutions has positioned it as a promising asset, and some analysts believe it could eventually reach $5. However, the timeline for such growth remains uncertain, as XRP’s price movements have been influenced by regulatory challenges and market fluctuations. While its long-term potential is still debated, investors looking for faster returns are exploring alternatives like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which offers a dynamic ecosystem with immediate utility and a structured growth strategy. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly establishing itself as a strong contender in decentralized finance (DeFi), attracting both experienced investors and newcomers seeking high-growth opportunities. Unlike many early-stage projects, Mutuum Finance provides tangible financial utility through its decentralized lending protocol. Users can supply assets to earn passive income or borrow funds while keeping their holdings intact, creating a sustainable economic model that drives continuous demand for the MUTM token. These real-world applications set it apart from speculative tokens and position it for long-term success. The project’s presale has already demonstrated remarkable traction, raising over $1,040,000 in a short time while surpassing 2,200 holders. With more than 97% of Phase 1 tokens sold out, early investors are securing MUTM at $0.01 before the next price increase. Analysts point to this rapid fundraising as a key indicator of growing confidence in the project. As more participants enter the ecosystem and upcoming exchange listings expand accessibility, many believe Mutuum Finance is positioned for exponential growth. Mutuum Finance’s long-term value is further reinforced by its ecosystem utilities, which are designed to create sustained demand and price appreciation. The integration of an overcollateralized stablecoin ensures stability in lending and borrowing, while the buy-and-distribute mechanism continuously supports token demand by using platform revenue to repurchase MUTM from the market. This self-sustaining approach fosters price stability and encourages long-term holding, benefiting both lenders and borrowers. Mutuum Finance’s overcollateralized stablecoin operates on the Ethereum network, maintaining a 1:1 backing with on-chain collateral. This ensures that every minted token is fully secured, allowing users to borrow stable-value assets while keeping their crypto holdings intact. When users lock assets as collateral, they can generate the stablecoin, which is later burned upon loan repayment or liquidation. This process stabilizes supply and demand, offering a transparent and decentralized alternative to traditional stablecoins while improving liquidity within the platform’s lending ecosystem. With a clear roadmap, growing adoption, and strong early-stage momentum, Mutuum Finance is gaining recognition as one of the most promising DeFi projects of 2025. Analysts predict that as adoption increases and the platform scales, MUTM’s value will surge by 4,500%, offering significant upside potential for early investors. Those who recognize its growth potential now have the opportunity to secure a position before the project gains widespread market attention.

XRP – Facilitating Global Financial Transactions XRP continues to be influential in the crypto sphere, especially for its efficiency in handling large-scale, low-cost transactions across borders. Supported by numerous financial institutions, XRP recently gained attention due to speculation about the SEC potentially dropping its lawsuit against Ripple, sparking optimism. As financial infrastructures more fully embrace blockchain, XRP emerges as a top contender among the best crypto coins to buy now, thanks to its practical applications in global finance. Its capability for quick, cost-effective transactions positions it well for expanded use.

Beginning February 17, Jupiter will dedicate 50% of protocol fees to repurchase and lock JUP tokens for three years, bolstering long-term value and stability. With a transparent buyback dashboard, Jupiter is strategically poised for continued growth in the DeFi sector. The current price of JUP is $0.00073409, with the buyback strategy expected to significantly enhance its market value moving forward. Final Words!

XRP remains a top choice for cross-border payments, and Jupiter’s strategic buyback plan positions it as a key player in decentralized exchanges. For investors exploring the best crypto coins to buy now , these assets offer promising avenues for both immediate and long-term growth.

This comes after several recent events suggest a significant change in how the agency handles crypto rules. OpenSea Lawsuit End: New Era for Crypto Oversight? OpenSea has been under investigation since last year when it received a “Wells notice from the SEC. This is a formal warning that the regulatory agency might take legal action. The SEC believed some NFTs on OpenSea could be unregistered securities. This raised questions about how digital collectibles fit into existing laws. Meanwhile, the SEC decided to drop the case against OpenSea shortly after it announced plans to dismiss its lawsuit against Coinbase. These back-to-back decisions suggest the agency is easing its tough approach to crypto, which was what the former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s leadership was known for. Under new leadership, the SEC is changing its strategy. Acting Chairman Mark T. Uyeda has put Commissioner Hester Peirce, a strong supporter of fair crypto rules, in charge of a new unit called the Crypto Task Force. This task force’s role is to work on clearer regulations and communicate directly with crypto companies. OpenSea Victory and the Future of NFT Regulation For OpenSea, the SEC’s decision removes a big legal risk. CEO Devin Finzer criticized the investigation, saying it was unfair to artists and creators. Now that the case is closed, OpenSea can focus on its plans, including the launch of its SEA token airdrop, which will be available to U.S. users. The company hinted at the airdrop after recently introducing its new OS2 platform . Crypto airdrops have always been in a legal gray area. In September, members of Congress asked the SEC to clarify their rules, saying the uncertainty hurts U.S. investors. With the SEC changing its approach, future airdrops and NFT marketplaces may face fewer legal issues. SEC’s Changing Stance on Crypto Cases This is not the first time the SEC has stepped back from a crypto investigation. Last year, it looked into Paxos’ BUSD stablecoin, saying it might be a security, but later dropped the case. The SEC also ended its investigation into Ethereum’s switch to proof-of-stake. Now, with Peirce’s task force working with companies on issues like staking ETFs, the SEC seems more focused on crypto advancements. This marks a shift from its previous strict enforcement approach.

Details,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-ceo-stresses-major-shift-end-of-xrp-case-is-near-details/,"Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently shared his perspective on the SEC’s regulatory stance, suggesting that the agency under its current leadership is moving away from the enforcement-driven policies of the previous administration. Acknowledging the impatience of many within the crypto community, he noted that the SEC appears to be taking a different approach, signaling a potential shift in regulatory strategy. His statement quickly gained traction among XRP supporters and the broader cryptocurrency industry, sparking speculation about the potential resolution of the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit. Many see this as a sign that the prolonged legal battle, which began in December 2020, could be approaching its conclusion. BREAKING: CEO of @Ripple – Brad Garlinghouse says: “This SEC has demonstrated a clear interest in moving on quickly (!) from the failed regulation by enforcement policies of the last Administration.” The End Of The SEC v. RIPPLE Case Is Near! #XRP pic.twitter.com/GrqTukv7OB — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) February 21, 2025 Community Reactions and Speculation The response from the crypto community was immediate. X user JackTheRippler shared Garlinghouse’s statement, emphasizing its significance by framing it as a major development. His post suggested that the SEC is moving from its previous regulatory approach, fueling optimism among XRP enthusiasts. Not everyone was convinced. Kailas Worlds expressed skepticism, questioning why there had been no official dismissal of the lawsuit. He called for “less talk, more action,” reflecting the impatience of many XRP supporters waiting for a resolution for years. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 On the other hand, TraderJoe struck a more optimistic tone. He pointed out that the U.S. crypto market is expanding rapidly and suggested that this regulatory shift could pave the way for greater institutional adoption of XRP. According to him, once the lawsuit is resolved, XRP could see a significant increase in usage and market activity. Implications of a Regulatory Shift Garlinghouse’s remarks imply that the SEC may be re-evaluating its regulatory approach. The enforcement-heavy tactics of the previous administration have faced widespread criticism from industry leaders and policymakers, who argue that such an approach has created uncertainty rather than clarity. If the SEC is indeed adopting a more structured and transparent regulatory framework, this could be a welcome change for blockchain companies operating in the U.S. For Ripple and XRP, the potential shift raises questions about the lawsuit’s future. If the SEC truly intends to “move on quickly,” as Garlinghouse hinted, this could mean an openness to resolving outstanding enforcement actions rather than prolonging them. However, no official confirmation has been provided regarding a resolution, leaving the community in anticipation.

With the market’s constant ebb and flow, it’s easy to miss out on potential goldmines. Let’s dive into two top crypto assets : one that might’ve sailed past you—Near Protocol—and another that’s still docked, waiting for you to hop on board—Qubetics. Near Protocol: The One That Got Away Remember when Bitcoin was just a whisper among tech geeks? Those who got in early are probably lounging on private islands now. Near Protocol had a similar buzz. Launched to tackle scalability issues, it promised faster transactions and lower fees. But if you’re hearing about it now, you might’ve missed the boat. Back in January 2022, Near Protocol hit its all-time high at $20.44. Fast forward to today, and it’s trading around $3.58. That’s a significant drop, but hindsight’s 20/20, right? Analysts had high hopes, predicting it could reach $6.59 by 2025. But the crypto seas are unpredictable, and not all ships sail as expected. So, what happened? The market’s a wild beast. While Near Protocol offered innovative solutions, competition is fierce. Newer platforms emerged, each claiming to be the next big thing. If you didn’t jump on Near Protocol during its peak, you might feel like you missed out. But don’t beat yourself up; the crypto world is full of second chances. Qubetics: Your Ticket to the Next Big Thing Missed out on Near Protocol? Don’t sweat it. Qubetics is here, and it’s making waves. Imagine a world where your online privacy isn’t just a myth. Qubetics offers a decentralized VPN (dVPN) that ensures your data isn’t being hawked to the highest bidder. Traditional VPNs? They’re like using a screen door on a submarine. Centralized and prone to data leaks. Qubetics flips the script with its peer-to-peer network. No central authority means no single point of failure. Whether you’re a journalist dodging censorship or just someone who values their Netflix binge sessions without regional blocks, Qubetics has your back. But wait, there’s more. Qubetics isn’t just about privacy; it’s about opportunity. The crypto presale is in its 22nd stage, and folks are buzzing. Over 484 million tokens sold to more than 20,900 holders, raking in a cool $13.6 million. Right now, $TICS tokens are up for grabs at $0.08073 each. But don’t drag your feet; each stage lasts just seven days, with a 10% price bump every Sunday at midnight. Analysts are whispering sweet nothings about $TICS, predicting it could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale—a juicy 209.67% return on investment. And if the stars align? We might see $1 post-presale and even $15 after the mainnet launch. That’s some serious cheddar. Think about it. An investment of $7,500 today snags you about 92,887 $TICS tokens. If $TICS climbs to $1, you’re looking at $92,887. And if it moonshots to $10? That’s a whopping $928,870. Not too shabby for a day’s work. Interoperability: Bridging the Digital Divide Beyond the dVPN, Qubetics is all about interoperability. In plain English? Making sure different systems play nice together. Picture this: you’re a freelance graphic designer juggling multiple platforms—PayPal, Venmo, crypto wallets. It’s a headache. Qubetics streamlines this mess, allowing seamless transactions across various platforms. Or imagine a business owner dealing with suppliers overseas. Currency conversions, transfer fees, and delays are the norm. With Qubetics, transactions are swift, fees are slashed, and everyone’s happy. It’s like having a universal translator for your financial dealings. Don’t Let This Ship Sail Without You The crypto seas are choppy, and opportunities can slip through your fingers. Near Protocol might’ve been a missed chance, but Qubetics is anchored and ready. With its innovative solutions and a heating up presale, now’s the time to act. Head over to their official site and snag your $TICS tokens before the next price hike. Remember, in the world of crypto, fortune favors the bold. Don’t let this golden opportunity become another “what if.” For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is Qubetics? Qubetics is a decentralized platform offering a VPN service that ensures online privacy through a peer-to-peer network, eliminating centralized control. How can I purchase $TICS tokens? Visit the Qubetics presale page, select your preferred cryptocurrency for payment, enter the desired amount of $TICS tokens, and follow the prompts to complete your purchase. What are the benefits of using Qubetics’ dVPN? Unlike traditional VPNs, Qubetics’ dVPN offers enhanced privacy by operating on a decentralized network, making it resistant to censorship and data breaches. What is interoperability in the context of Qubetics? Interoperability refers to Qubetics’ ability to facilitate seamless transactions across different platforms and systems, simplifying processes for businesses and individuals. Why is there urgency in purchasing $TICS tokens now? The presale is structured in stages, with each stage lasting seven days and a 10% price increase at the end of each stage. Purchasing now secures a lower price before the next hike.

The interaction triggered a $5 billion capital inflow within hours. Binance Coin (BNB) Price Surges 6% amid Kanye West and CZ Chats Binance exchange native coin BNB has been subject to intense market volatility in recent days. Within hours of the Bybit exchange hack , Binance transferred 50,000 ETH to provide emergency support and liquidity for user withdrawals, which successfully helped ease panic and avoid systemic risks. BNB Price Action, Feb 22, 2025 | TradingView BNB price made rapid 6% recovery from Friday’s shock sell-off, as Billionaire rapper and fashion entrepreneur Kanye West, known for his controversial online statements, made enquiries about launching a new crypto project and called Changpeng Zhao’s attention in his latest series of cryptic posts on X (prev. Twitter). Kanye West’s Token Launch Enquiry with CZ Sparks Intense Speculation Kanye West, recognized for his unpredictable ventures in music, fashion, and politics, took to social media on February 22 to discuss cryptocurrency. In a series of posts, he shared screenshots of private messages debating whether to launch his own blockchain rather than simply creating a meme coin. West reposted a message from Mikey Shelton stating, “You are the brand. Whatever it is will do well. Some things are better than others. It’s about who you trust.” This suggested that West is considering a serious blockchain project rather than jumping onto meme coin trends. Another post showed a conversation with Edward, who advised him: “Using Cardano as an example, they had the Cardano token, a wallet system, a whitepaper, a roadmap website, etc. You could set up a similar structure.” Kanye West inquires about BNB | Feb 22, 2025 | Source: X.com/Kanyewest Adding to the speculation, Kanye recently followed Changpeng Zhao on X, making CZ the only person he follows. CZ responded humorously, posting: “DEX is so much harder to use…” further fueling rumors of a collaboration. West’s interest comes amid a growing wave of celebrity-driven crypto projects. In recent years, figures like Iggy Azalea, Caitlyn Jenner, and former NBA stars have launched their own tokens, with mixed results. BNB Price Forecast: $700 Breakout Imminent if CZ Talks with Ye Advance Further BNB price forecast chart suggests strong upside momentum, consolidating above key technical levels. The 12-hour chart shows BNB trading at $669.5, gaining 3.41% on the session. BNB Price Forecast | BNBUSD Bollinger Bands Expansion: The price is pressing against the upper band at $689.8, signaling increasing bullish pressure. A breakout above this level could propel BNB toward $700, particularly if discussions between Kanye and CZ sparks more speculative demand. Volume Delta Surge: Buying volume is outpacing selling pressure. A significant 24.48K increase in volume on the latest green candle aligns with a 5.35% price gain, indicating strong market participation. On-Balance Volume (OBV) Trend: OBV has flipped positive, confirming accumulation. Historically, such a shift precedes sustained rallies, making a retest of $700 likely. A rejection at $689.8 could trigger a short-term pullback to the middle Bollinger Band at $663.1, while the lower band at $636.5 serves as the last line of defense against a broader correction. For BNB to sustain its uptrend, it must establish firm support above $680. A failure to hold this level could invalidate the bullish outlook, leading to increased volatility.

TIA price has climbed 3.80% in the last 24 hours, but it’s still down 83.15% from a year ago. The market sentiment remains bearish, and Celestia is trading below key resistance levels. Meanwhile, FTX token is up 15% in a week as excitement builds around the exchange’s repayment plan, set to begin on February 18. Short-term momentum looks strong, but long-term uncertainty remains. While some tokens are struggling, BlockDAG is growing fast. Its TG Tap Miner now has over 200,000 users, proving to be one of the hottest play-to-earn opportunities. With BDAG projected to hit $1 in 2025, this free mining game is fueling the entire ecosystem, making BlockDAG a top crypto to buy in 2025. BlockDAG’s TG Tap Miner Crosses 200K Users—Why It’s a Game-Changer Mining crypto doesn’t have to be complicated, and BlockDAG’s TG Tap Miner proves it. With over 200,000 users, this Telegram-based game makes earning BDAG as easy as tapping a screen. Each session lets players earn Tap Points, which will convert into BDAG when the blockchain goes live. As BDAG’s price is projected to hit $1 in 2025, early participants are stacking up potential future rewards. The ease of use and growing adoption make BlockDAG’s ecosystem one of the most exciting developments in the space. The BlockDAG presale is another sign of its momentum, with over $197 million raised so far. BDAG is currently priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27, with 18.4 billion coins sold. With plans to list on 10+ major exchanges, the project is attracting serious attention. The presale’s rapid growth shows why many are considering BlockDAG a top crypto to buy in 2025, offering a chance to get in before the price surges. With both the TG Tap Miner and presale driving adoption, BlockDAG is building a strong foundation. The X1 Miner app has already surpassed 500,000 active users, adding to the network’s reach. As the launch approaches, BlockDAG continues to stand out as a top crypto to buy in 2025. Is a Rebound Coming? Latest TIA Price Update The TIA price has gained 3.80% in the last 24 hours, showing some short-term recovery, but the overall trend remains bearish. It is still down 35.92% in the past month and 83.15% over the past year, trading at $3.18. With key resistance at $3.10, $3.17, and $3.23, TIA needs a strong push to break higher. Analysts predict a possible jump to $3.99 by February 22, which would be a 29.66% increase, but sentiment remains weak, with 22 indicators bearish and only 4 bullish. Celestia hit an all-time high of $20.85 in February 2024, making the current TIA price a steep decline from its peak. Technical indicators show mixed signals, with some suggesting further downside. With market uncertainty still in play, breaking past resistance levels will be key for a potential recovery. Can the FTX Token Keep Climbing as Repayments Begin? The FTX token has jumped 15% in the past week, currently trading at $2.2172 after a 2.13% gain in the last 24 hours. The price surge comes as FTX prepares to start creditor repayments on February 18. Wallets with claims under $50,000 will reportedly receive 118% of their owed USD value within three business days. With this repayment plan in motion, speculation is building around whether FTT can push past key resistance levels at $2.8360 and $3.50. Despite recent gains, uncertainty remains. The 50/200-day EMA just recorded a Death Cross, a bearish signal that hints at potential downside. If FTX token breaks below $2.2050, it could fall toward $1.58. On the other hand, if bullish sentiment holds, analysts suggest a possible FTT rally to $5.50 this year, making the next few weeks critical for its direction. Summing Up TIA price is up 3.80% today but still struggling to recover from its 83.15% drop over the past year. Analysts predict a possible move to $3.99, but with sentiment still bearish, breaking resistance will be a challenge. Meanwhile, FTX token has surged 15% in a week, fueled by the exchange’s repayment plan starting February 18. With small creditors set to receive 118% of their claims, FTT is seeing renewed interest, though technical indicators remain mixed. While these tokens face uncertainty, BlockDAG is proving to be a top crypto to buy in 2025. With over 200,000 users tapping to earn BDAG and its presale surpassing $197 million, the ecosystem is expanding fast.

Tokens under $1 often combine strong fundamentals with significant adoption potential, making them an appealing choice. With 2025 expected to be a pivotal year for digital assets, the top 4 altcoins under $1 are gaining momentum. Some of these projects are already making waves with key ecosystem upgrades, while others are leading the charge in Web3, payments, and blockchain innovation. For those seeking value and potential, these altcoins stand out as options worth considering. 1. Web3Bay – Reshaping E-Commerce with Blockchain Web3Bay is redefining online shopping by eliminating intermediaries and giving users full control over transactions. This decentralized marketplace allows buyers and sellers to interact seamlessly using crypto, with its native token, 3BAY, facilitating payments, rewards, and governance. Currently priced at $0.004562625, Web3Bay’s presale has raised over $1.5 million, with more than 375 million tokens sold. The structured presale model increases the token price by 15% per stage, setting the foundation for its launch price of $0.1959. Web3Bay goes beyond traditional e-commerce by integrating blockchain for secure, fee-free transactions while offering governance rights through a DAO. The roadmap for 2025 includes the expansion of crypto payment options, NFT-based commerce, and a transition to full decentralization. As one of the top 4 altcoins under $1 , Web3Bay stands out with practical utility and long-term growth prospects. 2. Cardano (ADA) – A Research-Backed Blockchain for the Future Cardano has built its reputation on a methodical and research-driven approach to blockchain development. Trading at $0.772737, ADA remains an attractive asset for investors looking for long-term blockchain projects with sustainability and scalability in mind. The network continues rolling out upgrades, with a focus on smart contracts, decentralized applications, and institutional adoption. Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, has expressed confidence in ADA’s potential, comparing its trajectory to that of Ethereum and XRP. The 2025 roadmap includes further decentralization, increased DeFi integrations, and expanding real-world applications. As one of the top 4 altcoins under $1 , Cardano’s measured, long-term approach positions it as a strong contender in blockchain development. 3. Stellar (XLM) – Enabling Fast, Global Transactions Stellar remains a dominant player in blockchain-based financial services, offering near-instant and low-cost cross-border transactions. With XLM trading at $0.345041, it provides an accessible entry point for those looking to invest in scalable blockchain infrastructure. Stellar’s ability to process transactions within 3 to 5 seconds, coupled with minimal fees, has positioned it as a preferred choice for businesses and individuals seeking efficient payment solutions. The network continues to expand its partnerships with fintech firms and financial institutions, reinforcing its real-world use cases. As adoption increases, Stellar’s role in the digital finance space strengthens. Among the top 4 altcoins under $1 , Stellar remains a strong option for those who see blockchain as a disruptor to traditional financial systems. 4. Tron (TRX) – Growing Its Role in DeFi Tron has steadily gained recognition for its expanding footprint in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. Currently priced at $0.242291, TRX has recorded a 2.65% gain recently, signaling resilience amid market fluctuations. With its blockchain optimized for speed and low fees, Tron is becoming an increasingly attractive platform for DeFi applications and entertainment-based blockchain services. Beyond its technical capabilities, Tron’s presence in the DeFi space continues to grow. It is frequently cited as a small-cap asset with the potential for significant returns under favorable market conditions. If the DeFi ecosystem expands further, Tron’s utility and adoption could increase, supporting its price growth. With these factors in play, TRX solidifies its position among the top 4 altcoins under $1 as a promising player in the evolving blockchain landscape. Key Highlights! Finding undervalued cryptocurrencies with high potential goes beyond just looking at low prices—it’s about identifying projects with strong fundamentals and meaningful use cases. The top 4 altcoins under $1 listed here bring distinct value propositions, whether through Web3Bay’s decentralized e-commerce model, Stellar’s rapid transaction capabilities, Cardano’s research-driven framework, or Tron’s growing role in DeFi. Each of these projects is positioned for significant developments in 2025. Web3Bay’s presale momentum is growing, while Tron continues expanding its DeFi applications. Meanwhile, Cardano and Stellar remain focused on scaling their ecosystems. With these four cryptos in focus, there’s plenty of room for growth as blockchain adoption accelerates.

According to analysts at JPMorgan, there’s been a notable decline in institutional interest in the crypto industry, particularly through Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts. Institutional Demand Declines, Futures Market Signals Weakness Institutional investors have been a major primer for Bitcoin’s price rallies in the past year and they have been influential in Bitcoin’s break above the $100,000 mark. However, since breaking above this level, the Bitcoin price has failed to push further, which is a sign of a slowdown in institutional investments. Related Reading: Bitcoin Ready For ‘Take Off’—Analyst Reveals Key Signals This slowdown in institutional investments was confirmed by analysts at JPMorgan in a recent note to clients. One of the most pressing revelations from JPMorgan’s analysis is the apparent decline in the Bitcoin and Ethereum futures markets on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The bank’s research highlights a growing trend of backwardation, a scenario in which spot prices exceed futures prices. Typically, a healthy market sees futures contracts priced higher than the spot price due to the expectation of future growth. However, the current inversion suggests that institutional players remain hesitant, likely due to a lack of immediate bullish catalysts. “This is a negative development and indicative of demand weakness,” JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note to clients. “Lower demand from systematic and momentum-driven funds, such as CTAs, has also affected bitcoin and ether futures,” he added. Speaking of bullish catalysts, there has been a major slowdown in the euphoria surrounding crypto-positive developments from the new Trump administration in the US. Any supportive policies or regulatory reforms for the crypto industry are unlikely to take effect until the latter half of 2025. As such, Bitcoin and the rest of the market are currently stuck in limbo without any bullish catalysts and continued profit-taking. Allegations Of Market Manipulation Beyond the shifts in institutional sentiment, suspicions of artificial market suppression have gained traction within the crypto community. Industry leaders, including Samson Mow, CEO of Jan3, have voiced concerns that Bitcoin’s inability to gain sustained upward momentum above $100,000 appears “manufactured.” According to him, some large market participants are selling even as retail buyers are dollar-cost averaging and buying. These allegations are not new, as Bitcoin’s history has been punctuated by periods of suspected price manipulation by whales. The recent influx of more institutional investors even makes this price manipulation more possible than in the previous cycles. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Tightens — CZ Says There’s ‘No Escape’ From Crypto At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $96,180, down by 2% in the past 24 hours. Given the current trend, Bitcoin might continue consolidating around $100,000 in the short term, at least until the second half of 2025. However, long-term price targets from analysts for Bitcoin range from between $150,000 to $2 million.

In an interview with Rob Nelson on Roundtable, Boiron explained that Bitcoin scarcity and growing demand will drive the surge of the token’s price. He said: You’ve got this one asset that has this fixed supply, and all you need to figure out is whether demand is going to increase for this asset or not. It’s literally that simple. Marc Boiron Boiron has high expectations for Bitcoin, claiming the token poses less of a threat to investors in the current market state The CEO argued that Bitcoin is the easiest financial asset to figure out, yet most people don’t understand this concept. He even believes the asset could trade as high as $250,000 in the year, adding that Bitcoin will rise as demand for it grows and supply remains the same. He even pointed to the token’s scarcity as a reason for its potential growth. Moreover, he stated that, given the current market, Bitcoin has less downside risk despite the token’s history of price volatility. Boiron stated that with upcoming regulations, he can see that Bitcoin will pose less of a risk to investors than it typically does. Bitcoin dropped to less than $97,000 on Friday after the Bybit hack Crypto prices dipped on Friday after hackers drained almost $1.5 billion from crypto exchange Bybit. According to security analysts, North Korea’s Lazarus group was responsible for the attack. However, these analysts are overly concerned about the group’s advanced techniques, seeing how they pulled the largest attack in crypto history. Bitcoin fell to less than $97,000, down from close to $100,000 after the attack. Currently, the asset is trading at only $96,581, though it represents a 1.36% rise in the last 24 hours. Ether also slipped by nearly 4%, trading below $2.700. However, the coin is doing so much better now, showing a 5% rise in the last 24 hours to $2,774 . On Friday, Coinglass also reported they were over $500 million in liquidations.

At the same time, Shiba Inu coin has seen its burn rate soar by 2,000%, reducing supply and driving speculation about future prices. While these moves grab attention, a bigger shift might be unfolding in Web3 e-commerce. Web3Bay is reshaping the Shopify model by removing middlemen and fees. This blockchain-powered marketplace gives sellers full control over their stores. With a fast-moving presale, those who act early could join a major shift in online selling. Web3Bay Disrupts E-Commerce: No Middlemen, No Extra Charges! Shopify made it simple for anyone to start an online store, but Web3Bay is going further by cutting out platform fees and third parties. Sellers on Web3Bay maintain complete control without depending on banks, payment processors, or centralized platforms that charge high fees. Transactions happen directly on the blockchain, ensuring lower costs, faster payments, and no risk of frozen funds. This is a game changer for small businesses struggling with hidden fees on platforms like Shopify. Web3Bay is already gaining attention. Its presale has raised over $1.5 million, with the 3BAY token priced at $0.004562625 in the current stage. The price increases by 15% at each stage, offering growth potential for those who get in early. At launch, 3BAY is expected to reach $0.1959, making it one of the most promising presales right now. LTC crypto has shown how decentralized finance is reshaping industries, and Web3Bay is bringing the same approach to online shopping. Sellers connect directly with customers, eliminating platform interference, while buyers enjoy lower prices. As Web3 commerce grows, Web3Bay is positioning itself as a leading platform that could challenge traditional e-commerce giants. Litecoin Eyes ETF Approval as Price Momentum Builds Litecoin is gaining attention as talks of spot ETF approval gain steam. Bloomberg analysts estimate a 90% chance that the SEC will approve Litecoin’s ETF this year, which could attract more traditional traders. With Bitcoin paving the way for crypto ETFs, Litecoin’s solid track record and growing institutional adoption could push its price higher. Recent trends also suggest bullish momentum. Litecoin’s price has climbed 24.3% in the past week, outperforming the broader crypto market’s 5% growth. GameStop’s reported interest in crypto assets, including Litecoin, adds to the excitement. If ETF approval happens, Litecoin could see a surge in demand, making it a coin to watch in 2025. Shiba Inu Coin’s Burn Rate Surges 2,000% as Whale Activity Rises Shiba Inu coin is showing strong on-chain activity, with its burn rate jumping over 2,000% in the past 24 hours. More than 14 million SHIB tokens have been taken out of circulation, increasing speculation about future price movements. Reducing supply has always been key to SHIB’s price potential. Recent large withdrawals by whale wallets—such as the 85.5 billion SHIB moved from Coinbase—suggest growing interest. Unlike Litecoin, which is focused on mainstream adoption through ETFs, Shiba Inu aims to build a long-term ecosystem. Lead developer Shytoshi Kusama has shared an ambitious plan to make SHIB a global player by 2030. With rising burns, whale interest, and strategic growth, SHIB could be gearing up for a significant move. Summing Up! Litecoin could experience a major shift if ETF approval boosts demand from traditional traders. Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu coin is gaining traction with its 2,000% burn rate spike and whale transactions tightening supply, which could affect future prices. Both coins are attracting attention for different reasons. However, Web3 e-commerce is emerging as another major force, with Web3Bay leading the way. With its presale surpassing $1.5 million, Web3Bay offers an alternative to Shopify by giving sellers full control and removing platform fees. As traditional platforms continue to charge high fees, Web3Bay’s model could be the breakthrough that small businesses need as e-commerce evolves.

While Bitcoin (BTC) enjoys a well-deserved surge, whispers are circulating about another cryptocurrency poised to benefit even more significantly. FloppyPepe (FPPE) , an AI-powered meme token, is being tipped for the largest gains. Hence, the question is, why is FloppyPepe (FPPE) attracting so much attention in the wake of the BlackRock massive Bitcoin (BTC) buy-in? BlackRock Go Big On Bitcoin (BTC) With $127M Investment On February 16, BlackRock bought $127 million of Bitcoin (BTC). While BlackRock is known for its large investments, its purchases often show their faith in the token’s growth. However, an analyst has said their recent investment in Bitcoin (BTC) will take an unexpected turn. Crypto veterans expect Bitcoin (BTC) to surge but believe an AI-powered meme token will benefit the most from this transaction. Their rationale is that the combination of this token’s AI feature and its Real-world asset (RWA) attribute will make it a lifeline investment . FloppyPepe (FPPE): A High-Growth AI-powered Meme Token in a Bitcoin-Influenced Market The recent Bitcoin (BTC) surge, triggered by BlackRock’s $127 million investment, dominates news headlines, but seasoned investors pay attention to other developments. FloppyPepe (FPPE) emerged quickly into the spotlight as an AI-powered meme token with significant growth opportunities. Market analysts suggest that this AI-driven coin stands out due to its ability to capitalize on Bitcoin’s (BTC) rising power to draw in both meme enthusiasts and investors seeking quick profits. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is distinct from traditional meme coins because it incorporates AI-driven utilities to strengthen its sustainability. Its AI video agent delivers immediate market analysis for investors to make better decisions. Users will have the opportunity to earn revenue from AI-produced images through a forthcoming text-to-image feature on its Telegram channel. This inventive approach allows FloppyPepe (FPPE) to tap into rapidly expanding areas of the cryptocurrency market. Through its strategic tokenomics model, the FloppyPepe (FPPE) AI-powered Meme token offers more than technology. Through a 3% transaction redistribution system, current holders can earn passive income alongside the benefits of stability and scarcity. By implementing a deflationary burn mechanism, the platform increases asset value and creates opportunities for significant profit growth with rising demand. FloppyPepe (FPPE) prioritizes security and credibility within its fundamental objectives. As such, the network completed a smart contract audit by SolidProof to strengthen its transparency against possible exploits. The project spends a fraction of its revenue on wildlife preservation while showing dedication to improving investor portfolios and creating worldwide change. These elements have improved market trust in this AI-powered meme token. At its current price of $0.0000002 , FloppyPepe (FPPE) presents investors with affordability and profitable potential. Top YouTube crypto influencer NASS Crypto joins market veterans and analysts who support FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) future success. Bitcoin (BTC) leads institutional adoption, but major percentage gains might emerge from AI-powered meme tokens like FloppyPepe (FPPE). This AI-based meme coin stands ready to surpass Bitcoin (BTC) instead of merely following its momentum. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Gains Traction After BlackRock’s Buy-in Bitcoin (BTC) remains the leading cryptocurrency in the world, and BlackRock remains at the top of influential whale networks. Hence, the recent BlackRock investment in Bitcoin (BTC) has strengthened market trust. The most eye-catching aspect of this development is how this move affects altcoins like FloppyPepe (FPPE) . Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent rise demonstrates its established market position, while FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) expected profits demonstrate how the crypto market continues to evolve dynamically. Due to its mix of meme coin characteristics and AI functionalities, this AI-powered meme token benefits from growing interest in intelligent, community-focused projects. While it is uncertain if FloppyPepe (FPPE) will outperform Bitcoin’s (BTC) gains, its rapid growth rate shows it is the most prospective token in the 2025 market. Its affordable entry point makes it an attractive asset for a prosperous crypto market.

Toncoin is hovering near $4 as whale investors pour in $250 million, signaling a possible breakout. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu price is struggling around $0.000016, with whale transactions down 88%, adding pressure on support levels. While these assets fight for momentum, one project is flipping the script with a new way to engage in crypto. BlockDAG just made crypto buying more exciting with its Achievements Page, where users earn XP, complete missions, and level up for exclusive perks. Every action—buying BDAG, referring friends, or engaging with the platform—pushes you higher on the leaderboard. The best crypto to buy now isn’t just about gains; it’s about unlocking power-ups before others do. BlockDAG Turns Crypto Buying Into a Rewards Game BlockDAG has introduced a new Achievements Page, turning every transaction into a chance to earn XP, unlock perks, and climb the leaderboard.

The best crypto to buy now isn’t just about price—it’s about seizing every advantage before the next surge. Whales Drive Big Moves as Toncoin Price Eyes Key Levels Toncoin price is hovering near $4, consolidating after a $250 million whale accumulation over three days. Large investors picked up 68 million TON tokens, signaling confidence in its long-term potential. However, the market is at a crossroads, with low volatility and a tight trading range between $3.70 and $3.90. Technical indicators show mixed signals—while the Money Flow Index (MFI) at 16.79 suggests oversold conditions, the Parabolic SAR remains bearish. If TON breaks past $4.50, a trend reversal could take shape. On-chain data shows diverging trends among holders. Addresses holding 1-100 TON are up 32%, but daily active addresses have dropped 45% since last August, when Toncoin price peaked at $7.50. The market is waiting for a decisive move—whale interest suggests strength, but clearing resistance at $4.50 and $4.79 will be the real test. Whale Exit Signals Pressure as Shiba Inu Price Fights to Hold Support Shiba Inu price has been stuck near $0.000016 for the past two weeks, with whale transactions dropping 88% in that time. On-chain data shows a sharp decline in large-scale activity, with the average transaction size falling from $39,000 to just $4,707. This signals hesitation among big holders, increasing the risk of a drop below $0.000015. Technical indicators also point to uncertainty—the RSI hovers at 40.73, showing weak buying momentum, while the 50-day EMA at $0.00001682 and the 100-day EMA at $0.00001889 remain key resistance levels. Despite the slowdown, some signs suggest a potential reversal. If Shiba Inu price stabilizes and whale activity picks up, a move toward $0.000018 could follow. The meme coin sector is still strong after the DOGE ETF acknowledgment, and renewed hype could bring SHIB back into an uptrend—but bulls need to step in soon. Summing Up Toncoin price is at a critical point, consolidating around $4 while whales accumulate $250 million worth of TON. If it clears $4.50, a breakout could follow, but weak network activity raises concerns. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu price struggles at $0.000016, with whale transactions dropping 88%, increasing risks of a dip below $0.000015 unless buying pressure returns. While TON and SHIB battle resistance, BlockDAG is bringing a new way to engage with crypto. Its Achievements Page turns every action—buying BDAG, referring friends, and platform engagement—into XP and exclusive perks. The best crypto to buy now isn’t just about holding—it’s about leveling up before others do. As BDAG heads toward major CEX listings, those racking up XP now will be first in line for rewards.

Polkadot (DOT) and Hedera (HBAR) are both experiencing key market movements, with DOT pushing past resistance levels and HBAR approaching a potential reversal zone. But while these assets navigate price surges and corrections, Web3Bay is taking decentralization to a new frontier—e-commerce. Much like OpenSea revolutionized NFTs, Web3Bay eliminates intermediaries, giving users full control over online transactions. With a successful presale and rising adoption, Web3Bay presents a first-mover advantage in reshaping digital commerce. Web3Bay Drives the Shift Toward User-Owned E-Commerce Web3Bay isn’t just tweaking existing models—it’s flipping the entire e-commerce structure by prioritizing ownership and decentralization. Traditional platforms like Amazon and eBay act as intermediaries, collecting high fees and controlling transactions. Web3Bay removes these barriers, allowing merchants to retain full control over their stores and profits. Much like how OpenSea transformed NFT trading, Web3Bay is setting the stage for a decentralized marketplace, where sellers operate independently without interference from corporate platforms. Adoption is gaining speed. With over 375 million coins sold and a presale surpassing $1.5 million, Web3Bay is attracting both investors and early adopters. Currently in Stage 4, the presale price has risen to $0.004562625, reflecting increasing demand and confidence in its long-term impact. By integrating smart contracts for secure, transparent transactions, Web3Bay minimizes risks and reduces the fees that have long been a burden on sellers. As decentralization gains traction, Web3Bay presents an alternative to corporate-controlled online markets, offering users an efficient and community-driven commerce solution. Hedera (HBAR) Approaches Key Resistance—Will It Break Through? Hedera (HBAR) is holding ground at $0.228258, reflecting a minor 0.02196% dip from its last close. Intraday movement saw prices fluctuate between $0.239214 and $0.227705, placing HBAR at a key decision point. Looking at broader market patterns, HBAR appears to be finalizing a corrective Wave 4 within its Elliott Wave cycle, having recently tested the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.218. Historically, this range has acted as strong support, suggesting a potential reversal is forming. Technical indicators reinforce this view. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has entered oversold territory, a typical precursor to bullish momentum. Additionally, a descending wedge breakout on the 1-hour chart suggests an imminent upward push. If the current support holds, the next target sits at $0.31, with further resistance at $0.35 and $0.39. However, if HBAR falls below $0.218, traders may see a downward move toward critical support at $0.177. Polkadot (DOT) Surges—Is $10 the Next Stop? Polkadot (DOT) is breaking barriers, pushing past key resistance levels and showing strong bullish momentum. Analysts highlight DOT’s decisive breakout above $7.30, a historically challenging price zone. The move is backed by increasing trading volume and positive on-chain data, signaling growing investor confidence. If this momentum sustains, DOT could reach $8.50 next, with a stronger push toward $10 possible if buying pressure remains. Supporting this outlook, technical indicators such as the RSI and Moving Averages confirm increasing demand, positioning DOT for further gains. Beyond price action, Polkadot’s expanding ecosystem is adding to its strength. Parachain adoption and rising staking participation continue to reinforce its market standing. Still, traders remain cautious of potential market shifts, making $7.00 a key support level to watch. If DOT maintains its current trajectory, further bullish movement seems likely in the coming weeks. Final Thoughts As Polkadot (DOT) breaks through resistance and Hedera (HBAR) hovers near key reversal levels, both highlight the increasing demand for decentralized solutions in the market. However, Web3Bay is approaching decentralization from a different angle—one that could impact real-world commerce on a broader scale. Unlike traditional e-commerce platforms that dictate fees and policies, Web3Bay ensures direct transactions between buyers and sellers. Much like OpenSea changed how NFTs are bought and sold, Web3Bay is shaping the next phase of online trade. With a successful presale and strong adoption trends, it’s not just another blockchain project—it’s a potential game-changer for digital commerce.

With new projects emerging regularly, many crypto enthusiasts are always on the lookout for the next big thing. As we gear up for the next bull run crypto , it’s clear that certain digital assets are primed to dominate the scene. Among them, Qubetics, Ethereum, and Chainlink are making waves in the blockchain industry, each with its unique features and groundbreaking advancements. So, if you’re looking to understand how these players are setting the stage for the future of digital finance, this comparative article will break it down. Ethereum, widely recognized as the pioneer of smart contracts, has been a cornerstone of decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi). The Ethereum network continues to evolve with new improvements, including the transition to Ethereum 2.0, which focuses on scalability, security, and energy efficiency. This shift is expected to propel Ethereum further into the spotlight, and many are betting that it will play a significant role in the upcoming bull run crypto cycle. Meanwhile, Chainlink, the oracle network connecting smart contracts to real-world data, is another vital player in the crypto space. As decentralized applications rely heavily on accurate external data, Chainlink’s integration with various blockchain platforms has positioned it as an essential infrastructure for the entire DeFi ecosystem. With its growing adoption, Chainlink’s impact is only set to grow as we approach the next bull run crypto. But there’s another rising star in the crypto universe that is worth talking about: Qubetics . This innovative project is making waves with its next-gen, non-custodial multi-chain wallet, designed to streamline transactions across different blockchains while ensuring top-notch security. Through its partnerships with 1inch and SWFT, Qubetics is shaping up to be a significant player in the future of blockchain and digital finance. So, how does it compare to the likes of Ethereum and Chainlink? Let’s dive into each of these projects and see what sets them apart. Qubetics: A Game-Changer in Blockchain with Revolutionary Wallet Solutions When we talk about the next bull run crypto, it’s essential to highlight emerging projects that are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. One such project is Qubetics, which is swiftly gaining attention in the crypto community, and for a good reason. With its non-custodial multi-chain wallet, Qubetics is reshaping how users interact with the blockchain. First off, the Qubetics Wallet offers a seamless cross-chain experience, making it easier for users to perform transactions across different blockchain networks. This multi-chain compatibility is essential as the crypto world grows increasingly complex, with various networks and tokens coexisting. But it doesn’t stop there—Qubetics has also partnered with industry leaders like 1inch and SWFT to optimize trading and enhance security. Qubetics’ partnership with SWFT Blockchain introduces a wallet that redefines user expectations. This collaboration focuses on offering lightning-fast transactions and a level of cross-chain functionality that has never been seen before. With SWFT’s cutting-edge technology, users can easily swap assets and manage their portfolios across different blockchains. Security is a top priority, and the Qubetics Wallet boasts advanced encryption to protect users’ funds, making it one of the most secure options available. Moreover, the integration with 1inch further elevates the Qubetics Wallet. 1inch’s DeFi aggregation technology allows users to trade across hundreds of decentralized exchanges, ensuring optimized prices and unmatched liquidity. This means that Qubetics users will benefit from efficient trading with the best possible rates, regardless of market conditions. As the presale for Qubetics continues to gain momentum, analysts are predicting significant returns. The project has already sold over 484 million tokens to more than 20,900 holders, raising over $13.6 million. With the presale entering its 22nd stage, the price of $TICS tokens stands at $0.08073, and experts predict returns as high as 11,380% after the mainnet launch. The Qubetics presale offers an exciting opportunity, but it won’t last forever. In essence, Qubetics is more than just a wallet—it’s a comprehensive solution for anyone involved in decentralized finance, whether you’re an investor, business, or professional. By offering an intuitive user experience and powerful features, Qubetics is perfectly positioned to play a major role in the next bull run crypto. Ethereum: The Blockchain Giant Leading the Way in Smart Contracts Ethereum has long been a foundational element in the world of cryptocurrency, and as we approach the next bull run crypto, its importance remains undeniable. As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum’s blockchain is the go-to platform for smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The Ethereum network’s primary selling point is its ability to execute smart contracts—self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code. This has opened the door for decentralized applications to thrive, and it’s no surprise that Ethereum has become the backbone of the DeFi revolution. Developers and innovators flock to Ethereum for its reliability and scalability, making it an essential player in the next bull run crypto cycle. With the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, Ethereum aims to address its scalability issues and transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). This shift is expected to reduce energy consumption significantly while improving transaction speeds and lowering costs. Ethereum’s move to PoS will also reward holders of ETH with staking rewards, further driving interest in the ecosystem. Despite its dominance, Ethereum does face competition from newer blockchain platforms such as Solana and Avalanche, which offer faster and cheaper transactions. However, Ethereum’s extensive ecosystem, developer support, and ongoing upgrades ensure that it will continue to be a major player in the next bull run crypto. Chainlink: The Oracle Network Powering DeFi Chainlink is another blockchain project that is perfectly positioned for the next bull run crypto. Unlike Ethereum, which is focused on smart contracts and dApps, Chainlink’s main function is to provide reliable, tamper-proof data to smart contracts. Known as an oracle network, Chainlink acts as a bridge between the blockchain and real-world data, enabling smart contracts to interact with external systems, such as price feeds, weather data, and other APIs. Chainlink’s ability to provide accurate and secure data is crucial for the success of decentralized finance applications, which rely on real-time data for their operations. By connecting blockchains to the off-chain world, Chainlink makes it possible for decentralized applications to operate more efficiently and securely. Over the years, Chainlink has integrated with various blockchains and DeFi protocols, establishing itself as the go-to oracle solution for developers. As the DeFi ecosystem grows, Chainlink’s importance will only increase, making it a prime candidate for the next bull run crypto. The Power of the Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, Partnership with 1inch and SWFT As we’ve discussed, Qubetics’ non-custodial multi-chain wallet, in partnership with 1inch and SWFT, is set to reshape how users interact with the blockchain. This wallet is designed to address the challenges of managing assets across multiple blockchains, offering seamless trading, enhanced security, and a user-friendly interface. Whether you’re an investor, business owner, or crypto enthusiast, the Qubetics Wallet is designed to make your blockchain experience smoother, safer, and more efficient. With SWFT Blockchain’s advanced technology and 1inch’s liquidity aggregation, Qubetics is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the crypto space. Users can trade assets across multiple decentralized exchanges with optimized pricing, making it easier to maximize profits. Additionally, the non-custodial nature of the wallet ensures that users maintain full control over their assets, providing a sense of security and ownership that’s essential in today’s digital finance world. Conclusion: As we approach the next bull run crypto, it’s clear that Ethereum, Chainlink, and Qubetics are all playing pivotal roles in shaping the future of blockchain and digital finance. While Ethereum continues to lead the way with its smart contract capabilities, and Chainlink’s oracles provide critical data for decentralized applications, Qubetics is offering innovative solutions that address real-world issues with its cutting-edge wallet technology. The Qubetics crypto presale is an exciting opportunity for those looking to get involved in a project that’s poised to make a significant impact in the crypto space. With a strong community, strategic partnerships, and a forward-thinking approach, Qubetics has the potential to generate significant returns in the next bull run crypto. So, don’t miss out—now is the time to get involved in the future of digital finance.

However, the price now seems to be moving toward a retest of the ascending trendline support. This decline is driven by bearish market sentiment and the recent heist experienced by Bybit. Cardano (ADA) Current Momentum As the ADA price nears the support level, it becomes crucial to see whether the asset will hold this level. If the market does not experience a massive sell-off, the price may stabilize. However, if selling pressure increases, the market will likely continue this trend until sentiment shifts. ADA Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, ADA still holds its upside potential as long as it trades above the ascending trendline or the $0.73 mark. Looking at the daily and four-hour time frames, ADA appears to be forming a bullish cup-and-handle pattern along with an ascending triangle pattern, reinforcing its bullish outlook. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, ADA could soon hit the $0.85 level once it crosses the $0.78 mark. However, given the current market sentiment, if ADA falls and closes a four-hour candle below the $0.74 level, we could witness a heavy sell-off and a notable 10% price drop, bringing it down to the $0.65 level. As of now, the asset is trading below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the four-hour time frame, indicating that it is still in a downtrend. Meanwhile, its Average Directional Index (ADX) stands at 12, suggesting weak trend strength, which could be a key reason why ADA has failed to rally. Current Price Momentum and Over-Leveraged Levels Looking at the current market sentiment, intraday traders are over-leveraged at the $0.76 level on the long side, with $2.23 million worth of long positions. Meanwhile, the $0.785 level is another over-leveraged zone where traders betting on the short side have built $2 million worth of short positions. Source: Coinglass Examining these over-leveraged positions, it appears that bulls are dominating, which could help ADA’s price stay above the crucial trendline. ADA is currently trading near $0.77 and has experienced a modest 0.50% price surge in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume dropped by 50%, indicating fear among traders and investors, leading to lower participation compared to the previous day.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ADA|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-23 02:55:59
40711513,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=701324,1740279623,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/40711513.jpeg,Crypto CEO Calls Start Of The Altcoin Season With A Caveat,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/crypto-ceo-calls-start-of-the-altcoin-season-with-a-caveat/,"According to CryptoQuant’s data, the long-awaited altcoin season may have officially arrived. The CEO of the crypto market company, Ki Young Ju, has pointed out a significant surge in altcoin volume on Centralised Exchanges (CEXs). Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Tightens — CZ Says There’s ‘No Escape’ From Crypto CryptoQuant CEO Says Altcoin Season Has Begun Presenting a detailed price chart of the volume ratio of Bitcoin versus altcoins on CEXs, Ju disclosed that altcoins have been seeing significantly higher trading volume than BTC. Unlike previous bull market cycles, Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) is no longer the sole factor in determining the start of the altcoin season. Some analysts even suggest that the altcoin season is no longer dependent on Bitcoin dominance. Typically, during past altcoin seasons, investors and holders rotated their profits between Bitcoin and altcoins. This time, the CryptoQuant CEO suggests that even stablecoin holders move the market, favoring altcoins more than BTC and directly entering positions. Yu’s chart shows that altcoin volume on CEXs has exceeded that of Bitcoin by 2.71x based on the 90-day Moving Average (MA). Despite this increase, the CryptoQuant CEO warns that the rally set to follow the altcoin season will be selective, and not all altcoins may benefit. During the last bull run, the same event occurred, where only the most prominent coins, with proper utility, robust community, and a grand narrative, skyrocketed. On the other hand, low-cap altcoins experienced an increase, however, not as explosive as the ones recorded by coins like Solana, Cardano, and more. Based on Yu’s analysis the Bitcoin dominance no longer defines an altcoin season; rather, the trading volume does. Historically, a rise in BTC.D is seen as a deterrent to an altcoin season as the market is supposedly more interested in Bitcoin. Conversely, a decline in Bitcoin dominance is an indication of a shift in the market’s sentiment toward altcoins, signaling the possible onset of the altcoin season. Analyst Forecasts A Final Market Decline Before Altcoin Season While the start of an altcoin season could alleviate current bearish pressures on altcoins in the market, uncertainty still looms about whether this highly anticipated and recurring historical trend will occur in this bull cycle. A crypto analyst, identified as the ‘Alternative Bull’ has projected a final decline before the potential start of an altcoin season. The analyst forecasts that the altcoin season index chart will experience a significant drop and then skyrocket towards the 90 threshold before the end of 2025, as seen in the chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin Ready For ‘Take Off’—Analyst Reveals Key Signals Presently, the altcoin market cap, standing at $280.5 billion, has completed the second part of its previously formed Double Bottom pattern. This unique technical pattern is often seen as a bullish indicator, signaling a potential reversal from a downtrend to an uptrend. According to Rekt Capital on X, the altcoin market cap is attempting to break out of this pattern and initiate a bullish move towards a $300 billion valuation.

Jito (JTO) is making waves on the Solana network, having recently breached significant resistance levels, signaling a bullish trend, while PEPE is struggling to regain its footing following a sharp decline. But, it’s Web3Bay ’s 3BAY token that truly stands out, providing concrete utility in the burgeoning field of decentralized e-commerce. Unlike purely speculative tokens, 3BAY offers a multifaceted functionality encompassing staking, governance, and transactional utilities, reminiscent of Binance’s BNB. With a presale that has already amassed over $1.5 million, Web3Bay distinguishes itself as the best crypto investment with practical applications in the real world. Web3Bay’s 3BAY Token: The Best Crypto Investment for Early Backers? Web3Bay’s 3BAY token merges critical elements such as staking, governance, rewards, and transaction utility—akin to Binance’s BNB but with a focus on e-commerce. Token holders can enjoy benefits like passive income through staking, a voice in governance decisions, and discounts on transaction fees, making it a multipurpose asset within the Web3Bay ecosystem. With the presale rapidly progressing and over 375 million coins already sold, raising $1.5 million to date, the buzz around 3BAY continues to build. Currently priced at $0.004562625 per coin in its fourth presale stage, 3BAY offers investors an accessible entry point with substantial upside potential. Market analysts suggest that early adoption coupled with growing platform utilization could potentially drive the token’s value up by 100x, particularly as the demand for decentralized e-commerce solutions intensifies. For those looking for the best crypto investment with tangible utility and significant application in the real world, 3BAY presents an irresistible proposition just as it’s poised to capture the mainstream market. Jito’s Bullish Breakout Eyes $4.60 Amid Surging Demand Jito (JTO), a prominent liquid staking protocol on the Solana network, has recently soared past the crucial $2.90 resistance level, indicating a transition from bearish to bullish market sentiment, which could pave the way for further gains. This breakout has also seen a significant 76.01% spike in trading volume, underlining a growing interest in JTO tokens, while Open Interest has climbed by 6.46%, signaling increased market participation. Currently trading at $3.02 and eyeing the next resistance at $3.50, JTO has its sights set on a $4.60 target. However, sustaining momentum above the $2.90 mark remains key to continuing this bullish trend; failing which could lead to a pullback to support zones around $2.00 to $2.20. PEPE’s Price Struggles: Prospects for a Recovery? PEPE experienced a meteoric rise of nearly 30,000% to a peak of $0.0000283 in December 2024 but then suffered a 70% decline to $0.0000079 by February 2025. Recently, it broke below the $0.0000165 support level, now a formidable resistance, complicating its recovery efforts. Despite a rebound from a 308-day ascending support line suggesting a potential rally, indicators like the RSI and MACD remain bearish, hinting at continued weak momentum. Currently confined within a descending parallel channel—a typical indicator of ongoing corrections—PEPE’s short-term prospects hinge on overcoming this resistance. Long-term wave analysis suggests a potential extended correction phase lasting until December 2025, with a low target of $0.0000022. While there’s some optimism for short-term gains, PEPE faces significant hurdles ahead. Concluding Thoughts While Jito (JTO) capitalizes on its bullish momentum and PEPE grapples with overcoming resistance, Web3Bay’s 3BAY token stands out as a Best Crypto Investment with its foundation in real-world utility. Market fluctuations offer short-term opportunities, but the enduring value of a crypto asset is anchored in solid use cases. With 3BAY’s combination of staking, governance, and transaction benefits designed for the decentralized e-commerce space, it offers more than speculative potential. The strong presale performance, accumulating over $1.5 million, reflects robust investor confidence in 3BAY. As the cryptocurrency landscape matures, utility-focused tokens like 3BAY are likely to sustain growth, making them a prudent choice over alternatives driven by hype alone.

The token initially surged to $1.84 but quickly dropped to $0.64 as trading activity intensified. This early sell-off suggested that many holders took the opportunity to liquidate their tokens after the network transitioned to an open trading environment. However, the price has since rebounded dramatically, increasing by 97% in the last 24 hours. This rapid rise has made Pi the top trending coin on CoinMarketCap. Additionally, a community vote on Binance showed that 85% of users supported listing PI on the platform, which has further fueled interest in the coin. In just one day, Pi Coin saw an impressive 159.83% surge in price, reaching as high as $1.72 before stabilizing around $1.40. This rebound reflects strong buying interest and renewed confidence from the Pi Network community. Currently, Pi Coin is priced at $1.32, with a high of $1.52 and a low of $0.72. The price has shown signs of a bullish rally after breaking through key resistance levels, but some signs of potential short-term pullbacks are also emerging, with some traders noting bearish RSI divergence. Looking ahead, analysts are watching whether Pi will be able to maintain its momentum. If the price can hold above $1.10, there may be potential for further growth. However, if the coin fails to sustain its current price levels, it could face a pullback toward $0.94 to $1.00.

However, amid these established names, a fresh, vibrant token is emerging, catching the attention of shrewd traders with its promise of phenomenal value growth. With the bullish wave sweeping through the market, these opportunities are ripe for exploration, offering tantalizing prospects for unprecedented returns. The Enigmatic Allure of Catzilla: From Quirky Concept to Potential Powerhouse At the heart of this crypto adventure is Catzilla ($CATZILLA), a coin that marries the whimsical worlds of kaiju culture, internet memes, and digital currency. This peculiar blend is more than meets the eye. Beneath its playful façade lies a robust framework, evidenced by its structured presale and an expanding community driving the project forward. A Journey Through Catzilla’s Presale: The Strategic Path Ahead Catzilla's presale is ingeniously segmented into 14 stages, a tactic that ensures continued investor engagement. Each stage witnesses a price increment, rewarding early adopters with more favorable entry points. Insight into Current Presale Metrics: Current Price: $0.0009 Next Stage Price: $0.0010 Final Presale Price: $0.0016 Funds Raised So Far: $2.2M+ and growing Presently at Stage 7, there's palpable optimism within the CoinMarketCap community about its trajectory. As prices ascend with each stage, investors are eyeing these early stages for advantageous positions before market debut. Catch the $CATZILLA Wave Before It Escalates What Distinguishes Catzilla in the Meme Coin Universe? Although memes often drive coin popularity, Catzilla boasts additional merits besides mere viral charm. A Unique Concept The coin’s identity is rooted in a kaiju-style narrative, where a massive cat mascot wrecks havoc and collects rewards, offering a playful yet compelling storyline. Engaging Diverse Communities By intertwining anime, gaming, and meme cultures, Catzilla extends its appeal beyond typical crypto enthusiasts, aiming to draw: Investors seeking novel early-stage endeavors Fans of internet-driven viral phenomena Anime and gaming aficionados captivated by the kaiju motif Such a diverse audience base could bolster its long-term sustainability. Fostering Community Engagement A cornerstone of Catzilla's strategy is fostering robust community participation through governance voting, staking benefits, and play-to-earn elements, enhancing ecosystem vibrancy and longevity. Evaluating the Investment Proposition The presale is unfolding at a brisk pace, and with incremental price increases per stage, timing becomes crucial. Like most meme coins, it presents speculative risks but also significant potential, particularly with its gaming integration and community incentives. The project's future hinges on executing its roadmap effectively, making it a token worth monitoring closely. Consider the $CATZILLA Opportunity Cardano's Dual-Layer Advantage: A Deep Dive Cardano, renowned for its environmentally conscious proof-of-stake mechanism, leverages its dual-layer architecture to enhance scalability and smart contract execution. Its Settlement Layer handles transactions efficiently, while the Computing Layer supports complex contracts. These capabilities position ADA as a formidable player in the crypto landscape, promising scalability and lower transaction costs. Solana: Innovating with Scalability Solana focuses on delivering unmatched scalability, positioning itself as a robust platform for decentralized applications. Unlike its peers, it eschews sharding and second-layer solutions, opting for a unique architecture that enhances its high-capacity network. This, coupled with SOL's role in fueling the ecosystem, underscores its appeal to developers and investors alike. Wrapping Up While Cardano and Solana pursue ambitious price targets, Catzilla emerges as a compelling alternative, especially during its presale phase, with features that integrate community participation and game mechanics. It represents a vibrant opportunity for those ready to embrace its speculative allure and potentially considerable returns.

40715405,https://invezz.com/?p=2582142,1740282411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Crypto price predictions: Mantra, DeXe, Toncoin, IOTA",https://invezz.com/news/2025/02/23/crypto-price-predictions-mantra-dexe-toncoin-iota/,"Crypto prices rebounded during the weekend, with the total market of all coins soaring to over $3.20 trillion and the fear and greed index moving to the neutral level. This rebound was driven by speculation among crypto investors, who believe that these coins will do well this year. This article explores some of the top coins, including Mantra (OM), DeXe (DEXE), Toncoin (TON), and IOTA (IOTA). Mantra (OM) price forecast OM chart by TradingView Mantra price has done well in the past 12 months as it moved from being a fairly small coin into a $7 billion juggernaut. Its price has moved from $0.09 in 2023 to over $9 for the first time. The weekly chart shows that the OM price has soared in the past five consecutive months, beating other popular coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It has done this because of its high staking yield, regular airdrops to holders, and the fact that it is in the fast-growing Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization industry. Mantra price has remained above all moving averages, while all oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the stochastic oscillator have moved to the overbought level. There are signs that it remains in the markup phase of the Wyckoff Theory, which is characterized by high demand. Therefore, there is a likelihood that the Mantra price will keep soaring as bulls eye the target point at $10, and then resume the downtrend. Toncoin price analysis TON chart by TradingView Toncoin, the crypto project by Telegram, has been under pressure since Pavel Durov’s legal issues started in France a year ago. The TON price has crashed, while the total value locked (TVL) in its DeFi ecosystem has crashed. Most notably, the ecosystem has not done well, with tokens of most of its tap-to-earn games like Hamster Kombat and Notcoin crashing. The weekly chart shows that the TON price has retreated in the past few months after peaking at $8.24 in June last year. It has moved below $4, and crashed below the 50-week and 100-week moving averages. The MACD and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) have all pointed downwards, a sign that it is losing momentum. Therefore, the TON price will likely continue falling as sellers target the key support at $2.9154, the highest swing in October 2022. A drop below that point will point to a further retreat to $2. DeXe price forecast DeXe Protocol is a Web3 governance protocol whose token is well-known for the substantial staking yields it offers to its holders. Like Mantra, DEXE price has done well in the past few months as it surged from $1.87 in October last year to $20 in 2025. The DeXe token price has recently moved above the key resistance level at $18.18, the highest swing on April 1. This was an important price since it was the upper side of the cup and handle pattern, one of the most bullish patterns in the market. It is now in the handle phase, which is known for some consolidation. The DeXe price remains above the 50-week moving average, while the RSI and MACD are pointing upwards. Therefore, the price will likely explode higher in the long-term, with the next point to watch being at $27.20, the highest swing in November 2021. IOTA price analysis IOTA chart by TradingView The daily chart shows that the IOTA price peaked at $0.6362 in December last year and has now plunged to $0.2280. The 100-day and 50-day exponential moving averages are about to form a bearish crossover pattern, which is widely seen as a mini death cross. On the positive side, there are signs that it is about to form a bullish divergence pattern as the RSI and the MACD point upwards. It has also formed a falling wedge chart pattern, a popular bullish reversal sign. Therefore, the IOAT price will likely have a strong bullish breakout, with the next reference level being at $0.35.

The JV intends to apply for a license under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) new regulatory framework. HKD-Backed Stablecoin According to the official press release , SCBHK, Animoca Brands, and HKT have engaged in HKMA’s stablecoin issuer sandbox since July 2024. The trio has been assessing how stablecoins can facilitate financial market development and payments by connecting Web3 and traditional finance. The partnership is in line with Hong Kong’s ambition to strengthen its role as a global digital assets hub. By leveraging expertise across banking, telecommunications, and blockchain, the JV aims to create a secure and regulatory-compliant stablecoin framework. The initiative aligns with the city-state’s broader strategy to boost digital finance adoption while ensuring compliance with evolving regulatory requirements. In an official statement, Bill Winters, Group Chief Executive of Standard Chartered, said, “Digital assets are here to stay and the development of different forms of tokenized money is integral to the advancement of this industry. That is why we are actively involved in various Central Bank Digital Currencies, tokenized deposits, and, of course, stablecoins projects. We are introducing solutions and instruments that service this market and meet the growing client demand. As public chain instruments with proven use cases, stablecoins play a critical role in the overall digital asset ecosystem.” Hong Kong Eyes Bitcoin as a Strategic Asset Besides the ambitious stablecoin initiative, Hong Kong is also considering adding Bitcoin (BTC) to its fiscal reserves as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. Wu Jiexhuang, a Hong Kong legislative council member, recently proposed using foreign exchange funds to acquire Bitcoin, citing potential benefits such as attracting talent, boosting the local crypto industry, and increasing tax revenue. He said that leveraging China’s “one country, two systems” framework, adding Bitcoin to Hong Kong’s reserves could give the region an early advantage and help mitigate economic instability from its wider adoption in traditional financial markets.

Once regarded as a top-tier blockchain network, Solana (SOL) now struggles with network congestion, security concerns, and competition from emerging AI tokens. Investors who previously looked to Solana (SOL) for high-growth opportunities are now shifting their focus toward AI tokens for scalability but groundbreaking advancements. The recent setbacks in the Solana (SOL) price performance and market volatility have raised concerns about the Solana (SOL) long-term viability, reinforcing the urgency for investors to explore more opportunities like FloppyPepe (FPPE). FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Explosive AI Agent Token FloppyPepe (FPPE) represents the evolution of AI-driven cryptocurrencies, positioning itself as the most promising AI agent token for 2025. The project’s unique AI-powered ecosystem is designed to transform content creation and user engagement, setting it apart from the wave of speculative tokens in the market. The AI agent token has Meme-o-Matic , a state-of-the-art AI meme generator that allows users to input text, video clips, and images, instantly converting them into viral content. This advanced AI agent token utility elevates FloppyPepe (FPPE) beyond meme coin status. FloppyPepe (FPPE) has already proven its market appeal, raising $500,000 in the first three days of its presale. The private round sold out at an astonishing $907,200 in just 24 hours, signaling the overwhelming demand for this AI agent token. With an AI beta launch scheduled for next week, the project is on track to surpass $1 million in presale revenue in its first week alone. Compared to any other AI agent token with a larger market cap, FloppyPepe (FPPE) still has enormous room for growth. The platform’s AI-powered video generation tool, FloppyX , empowers users to create top-tier video content with automated pipelines and character consistency features. Meanwhile, its text-to-image AI agent , launching on Telegram in two weeks, will further solidify its standing as a transformative AI project. Unlike the countless rug-pull meme coins flooding the market, this AI agent token guarantees authenticity through multi-signature wallets, a bug bounty program, and a smart contract audited by SolidProof. With plans for multi-chain integration across Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Solana (SOL), this AI agent token is set to capture an even broader investor base. The FloppyPepe (FPPE) ecosystem continues to gain traction, supported by a rapidly growing Telegram and X (Twitter) community, reinforcing its status as one of the most community-driven AI tokens in the market. With a 1% token burn mechanism built into its tokenomics, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is designed to increase in value as supply decreases over time. The redistribution model assures that investors can stake their tokens and receive rewards, with 3% of every transaction redistributed to the community, further incentivizing long-term holding. Experts predict that FloppyPepe (FPPE) could surge from the price of $0.0000002 by an astonishing 12,560%, turning even modest investments of $1,000, $5,000, or $10,000 into life-changing returns. With AI agent tokens dominating the market, now is the time to secure an early position before prices skyrocket. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is Taking Over The AI crypto sector is experiencing explosive growth, and FloppyPepe (FPPE) is at the forefront as the most compelling AI agent token on the market. With its presale raising $500,000 in just three days and its AI beta set to launch next week, the project is on an unstoppable trajectory toward massive gains. Its powerful AI-driven trading strategy, coupled with its forward-thinking DeFi applications, make it the ultimate AI investment for 2025. As Solana (SOL) struggles to maintain its relevance, the opportunity to capitalize on the next wave of AI crypto evolution is here. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is the future of AI-agent cryptocurrencies, and the time to adopt it is now.

The crypto market has been under strain since the highs of mid-January, but some changes stand out more than others. Ripple XRP is facing a key moment with a potential XRP ETF on the table, which could bring new institutional interest. Meanwhile, the Solana network is dealing with short-term price drops due to upcoming token unlocks but remains a strong force in blockchain development. Both assets are making moves, but they aren’t the only ones changing the game. While XRP and Solana push forward, a new force in Web3 and ecommerce is gaining attention. Web3Bay is taking on traditional marketplaces like Amazon and eBay, cutting out middlemen and giving users direct control over their transactions. The project has gained fame when crypto experts were found discussing its potential. Could this shift redefine online shopping the same way XRP is transforming payments? Web3 and E-commerce: A Shift Away from Traditional Marketplaces For years, online shopping has been dominated by centralized platforms like Amazon and eBay, which control transactions and charge high fees. Web3Bay is taking a different approach, offering a decentralized marketplace where buyers and sellers interact directly without intermediaries. Built on blockchain technology, it ensures transparency, security, and lower costs—all while giving users full ownership of their data and transactions. Its presale numbers show strong demand. Web3Bay has raised over $1.5 million, with more than 375 million 3BAY tokens sold. Currently in Stage 4 of 28, 3BAY is priced at $0.004562625, with prices increasing at each stage. By the time of launch, the token is expected to hit $0.1959, delivering an ROI of 6,430% to early participants. On top of the strong presale numbers, Web3Bay has also raised a lot of discussions about its disruptive potential and long-term returns, becoming a favourite of crypto Twitter. Just as Ripple XRP is reshaping cross-border payments and the Solana network is fueling decentralized applications, Web3Bay is positioning itself as the future of online shopping. With traditional platforms under pressure for high fees and control over users, a decentralized alternative like Web3Bay could become the go-to marketplace for Web3 commerce. Ripple XRP: ETF Speculation and Market Moves Ripple XRP is trading around $2.57, with its price movements closely tied to regulatory developments. The U.S. SEC is reviewing an application for an XRP ETF, which, if approved, could open the door for institutional investors. This would be a game-changing moment for XRP, making it more accessible to a broader market. Meanwhile, Ripple is expanding its real-world use cases, with recent efforts to integrate tokenized U.S. Treasuries on the XRP Ledger, further positioning it as a key player in blockchain-based finance. However, XRP isn’t the only crypto at a crossroads. The Solana network is facing its own challenges, but its long-term potential remains strong. As XRP navigates regulatory hurdles, Solana is dealing with supply pressures that could impact its price in the coming weeks. Solana Network: Price Pressure vs. Long-Term Strength The Solana network is currently priced at $166.31, with a recent 9% decline adding short-term uncertainty. A major factor behind this drop is the upcoming March 1 token unlock, which could flood the market with more SOL. Additionally, network activity has slowed, with active addresses dropping 55% since November 2024. Despite this, Solana remains a top choice for developers due to its high-speed, low-fee transactions, keeping it well-positioned for future growth. Market sentiment around Ripple XRP and other major cryptos is also influencing Solana’s price. Political shifts, such as Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance, have added optimism to the space, but overall volatility remains a challenge. While short-term uncertainty looms, Solana’s core technology and growing adoption could fuel a recovery in the long run. But while XRP and Solana focus on finance and blockchain infrastructure, Web3Bay is bringing blockchain’s benefits to an entirely different industry—online shopping. Key Insights Ripple XRP is at a key moment, with potential ETF approval bringing fresh opportunities. Meanwhile, the Solana network faces short-term price swings but continues to be a strong player in blockchain development. Both projects are driving innovation in their respective sectors, but Web3Bay is taking blockchain to an entirely new space—online commerce. Instead of just being another crypto project, Web3Bay is offering a real-world use case in Web3 and e-commerce, cutting out middlemen and empowering users. With a rapidly selling presale and a 6,430% ROI projected by launch, it’s shaping up to be one of the most disruptive platforms in the space. As the push for decentralization grows, Web3Bay could redefine online shopping in the same way XRP and Solana are transforming finance.

The price is currently facing resistance between $2.65 and $2.80. On the downside, there is significant support around $2.50, and below that, a stronger support zone between $2.25 and $2.30. Resistance Levels According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, the primary resistance zone for XRP lies between $2.65 and $2.80. The price has yet to break above this range, and until it does, the upward movement remains limited. If XRP can close above the $2.80 mark with confirmed candles, we could see a continued upward movement towards $3. Once reaching $3, however, the price could encounter resistance again around this level. Support Levels On the downside, XRP has decent support at around $2.50. Should the price fall below this level, there is stronger support in the range of $2.25 to $2.30. If the price fails to hold these levels, it could signal further downside potential. Long-Term Predictions On the larger time frame, XRP began a rally in July and has been following a potential upward structure. The key support area is between $1.20 and $1.27, and as long as the price stays above this range, the bullish outlook remains intact. This sideways range between $1.20 and $4.20 has been a common pattern for XRP, and it could continue for a while. The current price movement suggests the upside may still be incomplete, and a break above the previous highs of $2.65 to $2.80 could signal a continuation toward the $5-$6 target range for the next cycle.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-23 04:07:39

Some, like Bitcoin, Mantra, and BNB have become highly popular and rewarding to their investors. Mantra has had quadruple gains in the past 12 months. Ghost chains refer to layer-1 and layer-2 blockchains that don’t have a thriving ecosystem of applications. These chains differ from other popular ones like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche that have an active ecosystem. So, this article explores some of the most overvalued ghost chain crypto coins to avoid in 2025. Cardano (ADA) Cardano is the most overvalued ghost chain crypto coin in the industry, with a market cap of over $27 billion. It has become the 9th biggest cryptocurrency in the world, making it bigger than popular tokens like Avalanche, Stellar, and Litecoin. Cardano’s popularity surged in 2021 when it was seen as the best alternative to Ethereum, which was then a proof-of-work (PoW) network. At its peak, Cardano was valued at over $90 billion. Today, Cardano is a ghost chain with no ecosystem. According to DeFi Llama , Cardano has a total value locked (TVL) of over $368 million and just $21 million in stablecoins. A closer look at its ecosystem shows that most of the biggest players are not popular. Liqwid, the biggest lending network in Cardano has a TVL of just $81 million. In contrast, AAVE, the biggest lending player in DeFi has over $20 billion. Minswap, the biggest DeX netwok in Cardano, handles less than $10,000 in volume a day. Near Protocol (NEAR) Near Potocol is another large ghost chain in the crypto industry. The NEAR token has a market cap of over $4 billion, making it the 29th biggest player in the crypto industry. Near Protocol is a layer-1 network that aims to be a better alternative to Ethereum and Cardano. It was one of the first chains to incorporate the concept of sharding, which slashed blocks into shards to supercharge its throughput. Near Protocol is a ghost chain because of its relatively small ecosystem. It has just 30 dApps in the decentralized finance industry. Burrow, a lending protocol, is the biggest dApp in the Near Protocol ecosystem with a TVL of $125 million. It is followed by Ref Finance, a DEX network that handles little volume a day. Near Protocol has established itself as a top c rypto coin in the artificial intelligence industry, but there are no major notable dApps so far. Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) Hedera Hashgraph is another overvalued ghost chain coin in the crypto industry. HBAR token has gained a market cap of over $9 billion. This growth was mostly because of its huge partnerships with top companies like IBM, Google, and Servicenow. HBAR token has also surged as odds of a spot Hedera ETF rose. Hedera Hashgraph has a relatively small ecosystem to justify the $9 billion market cap. It only has a total value locked of just $114 million, down from $214 million earlier this month. The biggest players in the ecosystem are Stader, SaucerSwap, and Bonzo Finance. Other popular ghost chain crypto coins to avoid There are many other popular ghost chain crypto coins to avoid this year. The most notable of them are Algorand , Stacks, Celo, Injective, Internet Computer, and XDC Network. To be clear: at times, these ghost chain crypto coins may surge in the long term. That’s because it is always difficult to value a cryptocurrency. Besides, mene coins, which have no utility have a combined market cap of over $73 billion, with the biggest ones being the likes of Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe.

The American rapper and businessman had yet another full-on Nazi meltdown, after failing to get Changpeng Zhao’s (CZ) phone number. Ye first teased plans for launching his “real” coin, then spiraled into a racial slur-filled tirade, as per usual. The hitmaker shared a chat with Mikey Shelton, who told him, “You are the brand. Whatever it is will do well. Some things are better than others. It’s about who you trust.” Another message showed Edward explaining , “Using Cardano as an example, they had the Cardano token, a wallet system, a whitepaper, a roadmap website, etc. You could set up a similar structure.” Kanye follows CZ, demands his number, then snapped Ye had suddenly followed Binance’s CZ on X Saturday, making him the only person he followed. The action immediately triggered collaboration rumors within the community, which CZ fueled with lighthearted replies to Ye’s tweets. Kanye then publicly asked CZ for his number, writing: “Wait Why all these n*ggas HONKEYS Jews & f*ggots won’t give me CZ’s number?” Moments later, he posted, “Oh wait CZ DM’d me I still stand on what I said though.” Ye was referring to the fact that CZ had commented under his tweet asking for the number and said “DM’ed you,” along with a laughing emoji. As of press time, CZ remains unfollowed by Ye, who has replaced him with Polychain Capital founder Olaf Carlson-Wee and grifter Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports. Then, Ye posted an edited/rebranded Binance logo featuring a swastika with the caption, “New Binance Logo.” Yeah, it’s that bad. Now folks in the community are saying Binance’s CZ is definitely backing out of the collaboration now. CZ, notably, has remained quiet, but we don’t see how he’s gonna get over this. Community Notes warn Kanye’s crypto posts are a scam As Kanye rambled about his Nazi-inspired crypto (Swasticoin), Community Notes flagged his tweets, claiming he “sold access to his account to Christian Barker, aka @barkmeta on X.” Users pointed out suspicious changes in dark/light mode and time formats in his screenshots, saying that multiple people were posting from his account. One note read, “This will be a major liquidity extraction event.” Another warning said, “It appears that Ye has sold access to his X account to a known crypto scammer. His tweets may promote a malicious token launch and are intended to scam users. Please be cautious and avoid engaging with these tweets or any related links.” Ye posted a video of himself to prove he didn’t sell the account, with Olaf of Polychain. He has now ignored the warnings and keeps posting erratically. He declared, “I’M PUTTING MY SWASTICOIN ON A DEX BECAUSE ITS DECENTRALIZED.” Ye also said that his token was already attracting attention, writing, “PEOPLE WHO DIDN’T LIKE THE NAZI POSTS HITTING ME UP FOR THE CA ON MY SWASTICOIN. Wait What’s a CA?” At the same time, Kanye insisted he was creating a legitimate financial system. In one post, he wrote, “YEEZY IS HERE TO CREATE A REAL CURRENCY ANY FIELD I GO INTO I LEARN FROM THE BEST AND TREAT THEIR LIFE LONG WORK WITH THE HIGHEST RESPECT.” But minutes later, he contradicted himself again, stating, “I TRULY LIKE JEWISH PEOPLE THEY JUST CAN NO LONGER BE THE CREATIVE DIRECTORS OF THE PLANET THEY ARE THE BULLIES, NO I’M THE BULLY.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Are You Making These Web3 Resume Mistakes? - Find Out Here",News|Binance,EN,0,0,BNB|EXCHANGE|ADA|PEOPLE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-23 04:36:35

This issue is gaining renewed attention after rapper Kanye West, who now goes by “Ye,” announced plans to launch a so-called “Swasticoin” in a series of controversial social media posts. West’s statements, which included antisemitic remarks about the Jewish community, mark a shift from his previous criticism of celebrity-backed coins that “prey” on fans. You might also like: Kanye West’s Super Bowl 2025 ad sparks Nazi-themed crypto frenzy On Saturday, West seemingly changed his mind. “I’m going to open the CA [contract address] for my Swasticoin to Jewish people and my friends and family first,” he wrote. Alongside this announcement, the “Jesus Walks” singer appeared to seek guidance on blockchain networks like Ethereum, Solana and BNB Chain, while also attempting to contact Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao. The posts sparked backlash, but they also highlighted a broader issue: the increasing number of meme coins promoting extremist ideology. A troubling trend Ye’s proposed token is not an isolated case. Over the past year, a wave of racist and offensive tokens have launched, prompting discussions about whether decentralized platforms should implement content moderation. Some of these tokens used racial slurs or Nazi imagery in their branding, attempting to gain traction in online extremist communities. “Hitler Musk,” for example, appeared on Pump.fun about a month ago after X owner Elon Musk, while speaking at President Donald Trump’s inauguration event, did a straight-a rm salute twice (observers interpreted it as a reference to Nazi-fascism). Before that, in 2021, a token named “HITLER” briefly surfaced before being delisted from exchanges. Another coin, “Groyper,” has been linked to far-right online communities. Despite the fleeting nature of these projects, their presence underscores how blockchain technology—while open and permissionless—can be exploited to spread harmful ideologies. Who’s addressing the issue? As racist meme coins proliferate, some in the crypto industry are taking steps to curb their spread. The Solana Foundation has acknowledged the problem, with Austin Federa, the foundation’s head of strategy, suggesting that in-app filtering could be a potential solution. This would allow wallet apps and decentralized exchanges to screen out tokens with offensive names or imagery. However, implementing such measures in a decentralized system remains a challenge. Racist meme coins can be dealt with by in-app filtering, argues @SolanaFndn 's @Austin_Federa , @thesamreynolds writes https://t.co/e6U1FGVgng — CoinDesk (@CoinDesk) March 29, 2024 Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has also criticized the rise of meme coins associated with dictatorships and racist themes , calling for higher-quality projects in the crypto space. Last March, Buterin expressed concern over the growing number of speculative assets that provide little value beyond short-term hype. He specifically pointed to Solana-based meme coins that he described as “openly super-racist” and condemned tokens linked to totalitarian regimes. Buterin emphasized that he has “zero enthusiasm” for projects driven by scams, rugpulls, or fleeting excitement that ultimately disappoints investors. But, in today’s day and age, where anyone can launch a token with meme coin generators (i.e., Pump.fun) without oversight. As a result, the problem persists. What’s Next? According to Coindesk, West’s planned token—possibly named “YZY” rather than “Swasticoin”—is intended as a workaround for Shopify’s restrictions on his Yeezy store. Reports suggest he plans to keep 70% of the token’s supply for himself, further fueling speculation that this is more about financial gain than ideology. This would align with Ye’s previous attempts to monetize Nazi imagery, including selling T-shirts labeled “HH-01” (widely interpreted as shorthand for “Heil Hitler”), which were removed after a Super Bowl ad directed traffic to his website. Despite Ye’s claim that the token will launch next week, it remains unclear if the project will materialize—or if it is another instance of inflammatory rhetoric designed to provoke outrage. His latest post simply read: “Time to launch my own blockchain,” leaving his actual crypto ambitions uncertain. West was reportedly inspired by Official Trump ( TRUMP ), the meme coin President Trump launched two days before his second inauguration. It’s currently down 78% from its all-time high. Trump raised eyebrows for his similarly massive insider-ownership distribution: 80% of TRUMP is currently held by CIC Digital, a business entity with ties to the president. Ye, too, wanted an 80% ownership stake but was negotiated down to 70%, CoinDesk. Should his token achieve even a fraction of TRUMP’s success, his stake could still be worth many millions of dollars. What is certain, however, is that racist meme coins continue to test the boundaries of crypto’s “wild-west” nature while industry leaders grapple with how to moderate offensive content.

40715412,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=680691,1740286827,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40715412.jpeg,Robinhood CEO declares prediction markets the “future” of trading and information,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/robinhood-prediction-markets-are-future/,"Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev is optimistic about the prediction market’s potential, noting that his company is betting big on it. He compared prediction markets to traditional news sources, asserting that prediction markets communicate information more quickly than newspapers or broadcast media. In an interview, Tenev described the potential of prediction markets and their place in Robinhood’s business model. The CEO of Robinhood believes without a doubt that prediction markets are the future of trading and information. Robinhood’s election prediction market sees record activity Robinhood saw a lot of activity around the prediction market for the 2024 U.S. presidential election. The platform tracked Donald Trump’s victory to a large extent, although Kamala Harris had a late surge after an Iowa poll was found to be inaccurate. Increased interest in the election drove a spike in prediction markets across multiple betting platforms. Robinhood had previously launched Super Bowl event contracts earlier this year but suspended their rollout after a CFTC request. Yet amid regulatory uncertainty, Tenev is optimistic about the future of the sector. He noted prediction markets are here to stay and asserted that this will be revealed over time. Tenev made the company’s broader aims for prediction markets known during Robinhood’s Q4 2024 earnings call. “We had more than half a billion contracts traded in just about a week leading into the election. You can expect a full events platform from us, with access to prediction markets across many diverse contracts later this year,” said Vlad Tenev Aside from Robinhood’s efforts, several major players, such as UMA, Polymarket, and EigenLayer, are working together to build a next-generation oracle infrastructure for prediction markets. This joint effort has several advantages, including improved mechanisms for resolving disputes, aligned participant incentives, and scalability and security. Advanced oracles shape decentralized truth in prediction markets Since its launch in 2020, Polymarket—the leading decentralized prediction market—has passed $6 billion in lifetime volume and resolved 14,000+ markets. Oracle systems available today do not scale well and suffer from subjective market outcomes. To solve these limitations, UMA , Polymarket, and EigenLayer are joining forces to research and develop the next-generation generation oracle based on EigenLayer’s intersubjective verification and UMA’s Optimistic Oracle (OO). With multi-token dispute resolution, the use of different tokens for staking and governance, and several other fundamental improvements, this next-generation mechanism will be a great leap forward as compared to our current system. In addition, it introduces dynamic bonding and AI integration, establishing dynamic bond commitments designed to strengthen economic security. The new oracle will also have improved bribery resistance through the security model of EigenLayer, which minimizes manipulation threats in the new oracle and increases scalability for high-volume markets, increasing dispute resolution efficiency for markets with thousands of active contracts. Polymarket’s founder, Shayne Coplan, highlighted the need for solid oracle solutions, noting that integrating Polymarket’s infrastructure, UMA’s optimistic oracle and EigenLayer’s security framework will reshape the establishment of decentralized truth. With Robinhood and the top players in the blockchain industry leading the charge, prediction markets could soon become a mainstream instrument for real-time, data-informed forecasting in multiple industries.

At the same time, Avalanche continues to struggle, and buyers are taking advantage of the discounted price. Lunex Network is also recording high adoption rates as the broader market sentiment is slowly but surely turning bullish. Litecoin (LTC) Could Become Third US Spot ETF with $580 Million Yearly Inflow Canary Capital filed an application for a Litecoin ETF in October 2024, making analysts optimistic about a potential approval during Q1. Litecoin’s proof-of-work consensus makes it less likely to be labeled as a security. Analysts are already anticipating up to $580 million in first-year inflows by the Litecoin ETF, opening up an avenue of new opportunities for Litecoin traders. Litecoin is currently trading for $129 after a 5.2% intraday decrease. Litecoin’s trading volume has recorded a 30% decline during the last 24 hours which suggests decreased market participation. Despite the minor pullback, Litecoin is still trading above all of its Exponential Moving Averages on the LTC/USDT daily chart. Since Litecoin’s Momentum Indicator also suggests bullish dominance, Litecoin’s price could rally toward the critical $200 resistance before the end of Q1. Avalanche (AVAX) Struggles Continue As It Rests On Support Avalanche’s price broke below the critical $34 level in early February and the AVAX price entered a downward spiral amid the market-wide bearish sentiment. Before the breakdown, Avalanche’s whale wallets also recorded positive net inflows in January leading to a $600 million capital inflow for Avalanche. Although most of these positions are now underwater, confidence in Avalanche’s long-term prospects is still high as analysts expect a major comeback once the market regains its footing. Avalanche is now trading for $24.60 after an intraday increase of 3.4%. Right now, Avalanche is trading below most of its long-term Exponential Moving Averages on the AVAX/USDT daily chart which means that its price is still in bearish territory. Lunex Network (LNEX) Attracts Capital Inflow with B2B Payment Gateway Lunex Network may not have an ETF of its own, but it has still managed to accumulate more than $7.2 million in capital inflows within a few weeks of its presale launch. Lunex Network’s altcoin is trending in the market for several reasons, but the most standout feature is the interconnected ecosystem that facilitates seamless cross-chain trading. By integrating the latest Web3 technology, Lunex Network is removing the barriers between isolated blockchain networks and bridging them with its disruptive ecosystem.

Cryptocurrency exchange behemoth Bybit suffered a $1.4 billion hack this week, whereas BTC and altcoins remained stagnant despite market advancements. Simultaneously, the meme coin sector panicked amid the emergence of the Argentinian LIBRA token. Here’s a brief collection of some of the top crypto market updates reported by CoinGape Media over the past week. Weekly Crypto Highlights: ByBit Exchange Hacked By N. Korean Group The renowned cryptocurrency exchange Bybit was hacked by ‘The Lazarus Group’ this week, resulting in a massive exploitation of funds. Reportedly, the North Korean criminal organization stole $1.4 billion worth of ETH from the crypto exchange. As a result, the broader crypto market saw a whopping $566 million liquidated in a day as investors started panic selling. In turn, BTC and altcoins reversed recent gains, backtracking to previous lows. BTC price closed the week at around $96K, whereas ETH was near $2,800. XRP & SOL also reversed recent gains, trading in the red this weekend. It’s also worth mentioning that ByBit rolled out a $140 million bounty for cybersecurity experts to recover $1.4 billion stolen in Ethereum. LIBRA Token Panic: What Happened? Meanwhile, Argentinian President Javier Milei endorsed the Solana-based LIBRA meme token this week, which soon rocketed in value. However, the market was taken by storm when insiders cashed out massive amounts amid the rally, urging LIBRA price to crash over 90%. This saga raised rug-pull concerns surrounding the crypto, further bringing heat to its price. However, President Javier Milei ordered a probe into the launch and KIP Protocol, aiming to rectify the error and bolster the token. This saga has emerged as another noteworthy crypto highlight this week, underscoring the market’s risky nature. ETF Filings This Week Simultaneously, a stockpile of ETF advancements was witnessed this week. Canary Capital’s Litecoin ETF emerged on Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), solidifying chances of approval. Further, Grayscale’s XRP ETF entered the U.S. SEC’s review mode. Also, asset manager Franklin Templeton filed an S-1 to launch a spot Solana ETF with the U.S. SEC this week. Mentioned above are the top crypto market highlights for this week, which appear to have substantially impacted investor sentiment.

40716623,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=133082,1740289055,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent: Bitcoin ETFs Bleed for 4th Day – Is Investor Confidence Shaken?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-etf-outflows-investor-confidence/,"Just when Bitcoin seemed to be riding an unstoppable wave of institutional adoption fueled by the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, a concerning trend has emerged. For four consecutive days, these much-hyped investment vehicles have experienced net outflows, signaling a potential shift in investor sentiment. Are we witnessing a temporary profit-taking phase, or is this the beginning of a deeper correction in the crypto market? Let’s delve into the details of these Bitcoin ETF outflows and understand what’s driving this recent market activity. Decoding the Data: Spot Bitcoin ETFs See Continued Outflows According to data from Farside Investors, February 21st marked the fourth straight day of net Bitcoin ETF outflows in the U.S. A total of $62.9 million exited these funds, painting a contrasting picture to the massive inflows witnessed in the weeks following their launch. To understand the nuances of this situation, let’s break down the performance of individual ETFs: Grayscale’s GBTC: The veteran ETF, GBTC, continued to experience significant withdrawals, leading the pack with a substantial $60 million outflow. This ongoing trend is likely attributed to investors capitalizing on arbitrage opportunities and moving away from GBTC’s higher fee structure compared to newer ETFs. Bitwise’s BITB: BITB saw a considerable $16.6 million in net outflows, suggesting that the selling pressure wasn’t limited to GBTC alone. Fidelity’s FBTC: FBTC, another major player, also recorded net outflows of $12.5 million, indicating a broader trend across the established spot Bitcoin ETFs . However, it’s not all gloom and doom. Interestingly, two ETFs bucked the trend, showcasing continued investor interest in specific offerings: BlackRock’s IBIT: BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, a standout performer since launch, continued its inflow streak, attracting a net $21.6 million. This positive momentum suggests strong investor confidence in BlackRock’s brand and ETF management. VanEck’s HODL: VanEck’s HODL also reported inflows, albeit smaller, at $4.7 million. This indicates a niche appeal or potentially different investor base for HODL. Other ETFs: The remaining spot Bitcoin ETFs reported negligible changes, suggesting a mixed bag of investor activity across the board. To get a clearer picture, let’s look at a table summarizing the inflows and outflows on February 21st: ETF Net Flow (USD Million) Grayscale (GBTC) -60.0 Bitwise (BITB) -16.6 Fidelity (FBTC) -12.5 BlackRock (IBIT) +21.6 VanEck (HODL) +4.7 Others Negligible Change Total Net Flow -62.9 Why are Bitcoin ETF Outflows Happening Now? Several factors could be contributing to this recent trend of Bitcoin ETF outflows . It’s crucial to consider these possibilities to understand the bigger picture: GBTC Fee Structure: As mentioned earlier, GBTC’s relatively higher management fee (1.5%) compared to new entrants (many offering fees below 0.3% and even fee waivers initially) makes it less attractive for long-term holders. Investors might be rotating out of GBTC to benefit from lower fees in competing crypto ETFs . Profit Taking: Bitcoin has experienced a significant price surge since the beginning of the year, fueled partly by the ETF hype. Some investors might be taking profits off the table after this substantial run-up, leading to temporary outflows. Market Correction: The broader crypto market, and Bitcoin specifically, often experiences periods of correction after rapid growth. These bitcoin etf outflows could be a symptom of a natural market pullback, as investors reassess their positions and risk appetite. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic uncertainties, inflation concerns, and changes in interest rate expectations can influence investor behavior across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Shifts in macroeconomic sentiment could be triggering some of the outflows. Rotation into Altcoins: With Bitcoin’s price appreciating significantly, some investors might be rotating profits into alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) which often exhibit higher volatility and potentially greater short-term gains during certain market cycles. Impact on Bitcoin Price and Market Sentiment While four days of outflows don’t necessarily signify a long-term bearish trend, they do warrant attention. Sustained Bitcoin ETF outflows could exert downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, especially if the selling momentum intensifies. The market closely monitors ETF flows as indicators of institutional and retail investor sentiment. Negative flows can be interpreted as a lack of confidence or reduced demand, potentially triggering further selling or dampening buying interest. However, it’s important to remember that: IBIT’s Inflows are Positive: BlackRock’s IBIT continuing to attract inflows is a significant positive sign, indicating that institutional demand for Bitcoin exposure through ETFs remains robust. Long-Term Perspective: The spot Bitcoin ETFs are still relatively new. Market dynamics and investor behavior are likely to evolve over time. Short-term fluctuations in flows are expected and don’t necessarily negate the long-term potential of these investment products. Overall ETF Success: Despite recent outflows, the overall launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs has been considered a massive success, bringing billions of dollars into the crypto market and broadening access to Bitcoin for mainstream investors. What’s Next for Spot Bitcoin ETFs? The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether these crypto ETF outflows are a temporary blip or the start of a more sustained trend. Market participants will be closely watching daily flow data, Bitcoin price action, and broader market sentiment. Key questions to consider include: Will GBTC outflows continue to dominate, or will they eventually stabilize? Can IBIT and other ETFs maintain their inflow momentum to offset outflows from other funds? How will Bitcoin’s price react to these ETF flow dynamics? Will macroeconomic events or regulatory developments further influence ETF flows? Final Thoughts: Navigating the Bitcoin ETF Landscape The recent net outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs serve as a reminder of the inherent volatility and dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the initial euphoria surrounding ETF launches may be moderating, it’s crucial to maintain a balanced perspective. The market is still in its early stages of integrating these new investment vehicles. Understanding the nuances of ETF flows, individual ETF performance, and broader market trends is essential for investors navigating this exciting, yet evolving landscape. Don’t panic based on short-term fluctuations; instead, focus on long-term trends and the fundamental drivers of Bitcoin and the crypto market.

40716737,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=133127,1740289341,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Action: OKX Blacklists Bybit Hacker Address in Swift Crypto Security Move,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/okx-blacklist-bybit-hacker-address/,"In a dramatic turn of events highlighting the collaborative spirit within the cryptocurrency industry, OKX exchange has taken decisive action following a recent security incident at Bybit. Hong Fang, CEO of OKX, announced via X (formerly Twitter) that OKX has proactively added the hacker’s address associated with the Bybit breach to its blacklist. This swift response underscores the increasing vigilance and coordinated efforts within the crypto space to combat illicit activities and bolster crypto exchange security . Why is Crypto Exchange Security More Critical Than Ever? The digital asset landscape is rapidly evolving, attracting both legitimate investors and malicious actors. As cryptocurrency adoption grows, so does the incentive for cybercriminals to target exchanges, which often hold vast amounts of digital assets. Crypto exchange security is not just a feature; it’s the bedrock of trust and sustainability in the crypto ecosystem. Recent events have spotlighted vulnerabilities, making robust security measures paramount. Consider these critical aspects: Escalating Cyber Threats: Hacks, phishing attacks, and sophisticated exploits are becoming increasingly common. Exchanges must stay ahead of these threats with cutting-edge security protocols. Regulatory Scrutiny: Global regulators are intensifying their focus on crypto exchanges, demanding higher standards of security and compliance to protect users and maintain market integrity. User Confidence: Breaches erode user trust, which is fundamental for the long-term growth of the crypto market. Demonstrating strong security measures is vital to building and retaining user confidence. Financial and Reputational Risks: A successful hack can lead to significant financial losses, reputational damage, and even regulatory penalties for exchanges. In this context, OKX’s proactive stance in response to the Bybit incident sends a powerful message about the industry’s commitment to safeguarding user assets and maintaining a secure trading environment. The Bybit Hack Incident: A Quick Recap While details surrounding the Bybit hack are still emerging, it’s clear that the incident prompted a swift and coordinated response from within the crypto community. Although specific details of the vulnerability exploited or the extent of the breach haven’t been fully disclosed publicly, the aftermath demonstrates the industry’s capacity to react quickly to mitigate potential damage and prevent further illicit fund movement. The fact that OKX immediately took action to blacklist the identified hacker address indicates a level of inter-exchange communication and cooperation that is crucial in these situations. This kind of rapid response is essential to: Limit Fund Movement: Blacklisting addresses on major exchanges makes it significantly harder for hackers to liquidate or move stolen funds. Aid Investigations: Shared intelligence and blacklisting efforts can assist law enforcement and security firms in tracking down and potentially recovering stolen assets. Deter Future Attacks: A united front against hackers sends a strong deterrent message and encourages exchanges to continuously improve their security measures. OKX’s Decisive Action: Blacklisting the Hacker Address Hong Fang’s announcement on X provided reassurance to the crypto community. OKX blacklist action is a significant step in hindering the hacker’s ability to profit from the Bybit breach. According to the announcement, OKX engineers are actively monitoring the blacklisted address and are prepared to take immediate action should any funds be transferred through their platform. This involves: Real-time Monitoring: Utilizing advanced blockchain analytics tools to track the movement of funds associated with the blacklisted address. Transaction Blocking: Implementing systems to automatically block any transactions originating from or directed to the blacklisted address within the OKX ecosystem. Collaboration with Bybit: Offering IT security expertise and liquidity support to Bybit, showcasing industry solidarity and a commitment to mutual assistance in times of crisis. This proactive approach by OKX not only helps in mitigating the immediate fallout from the Bybit hack but also reinforces the importance of collaborative digital asset protection across the crypto industry. Understanding Hacker Address Blacklisting: How Effective Is It? Blacklisting a hacker address is a critical first step in responding to crypto theft. But how effective is this measure in the grand scheme of things? Let’s examine the pros and cons: Advantages of Blacklisting Limitations of Blacklisting Immediate Disruption: Quickly hinders the hacker’s ability to move funds through compliant exchanges. Circumvention Tactics: Hackers can use decentralized exchanges (DEXs), mixers, or privacy coins to bypass blacklists. Increased Scrutiny: Flags the address across multiple platforms, making it harder for hackers to operate undetected. New Addresses: Hackers can generate new addresses, requiring continuous monitoring and updates to blacklists. Aids Asset Recovery: Provides a trail for law enforcement and asset recovery specialists to track funds. Global Reach Challenges: Blacklists are most effective when implemented globally and consistently across all major exchanges, which can be challenging to coordinate. Deters Future Use: Makes it riskier and more complex for hackers to reuse the same addresses. False Positives: While rare, there’s a risk of mistakenly blacklisting legitimate addresses, requiring careful verification processes. While blacklisting isn’t a silver bullet, it’s an essential component of a comprehensive digital asset protection strategy. Its effectiveness is amplified when combined with other measures like enhanced security protocols, proactive threat intelligence, and international collaboration. The Broader Implications for Crypto Users and the Industry The swift response from OKX and the industry’s collective action following the Bybit hack highlight several important takeaways for crypto users and the broader ecosystem: Exchanges are Taking Security Seriously: The rapid blacklisting and offers of support demonstrate that major exchanges are prioritizing security and are willing to collaborate to protect the industry. Importance of Choosing Secure Exchanges: Users should prioritize exchanges with a proven track record of security, transparency, and proactive incident response. Community Collaboration is Key: The incident underscores the importance of information sharing and cooperation within the crypto community to combat cybercrime effectively.

But what happens when the very institutions designed to safeguard AI are facing the chopping block? News has emerged that the US AI Safety Institute (AISI), a crucial body within the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is facing potentially devastating budget cuts. This development sends shockwaves through the tech community, raising serious questions about the future of AI regulation and safety in the United States. Why the Concern Over US AI Safety Institute Cuts? Imagine building a super-fast car without brakes. That’s essentially what unchecked AI development could become. The AISI was established to be the ‘brake’ – the organization studying potential AI risks and setting crucial safety standards. Created just last year under a previous presidential executive order, its mission is to ensure that AI development proceeds responsibly. However, recent reports paint a grim picture: Massive Layoffs Looming: Axios and Bloomberg reports indicate that NIST, the parent organization of AISI, is planning significant layoffs, potentially affecting up to 500 staffers. These cuts are expected to heavily impact probationary employees, many of whom are likely working within the AISI and Chips for America initiatives. AISI ‘Gutted’: Sources suggest that the US AI Safety Institute is being specifically targeted and could be “gutted” by these layoffs. This means a significant reduction in personnel and resources dedicated to AI safety research and development. Leadership Vacuum: Adding to the turmoil, AISI’s director recently departed in February. This leadership gap, combined with potential staff reductions, creates a perfect storm of instability for the fledgling organization. Policy Reversal: The executive order that initially established AISI was repealed by the current administration, casting further doubt on the institute’s long-term viability and political backing. These potential AI Safety Institute cuts are not just numbers on a spreadsheet; they represent a tangible threat to the nation’s capacity to navigate the complex landscape of AI safety. Expert Voices Raise the Alarm on AI Regulation Impact The news of potential layoffs has been met with widespread criticism from AI safety and policy experts. Jason Green-Lowe, executive director of the Center for AI Policy, voiced serious concerns, stating that these cuts would “severely impact the government’s capacity to research and address critical AI safety concerns.” His sentiment is echoed across the AI safety community. Cutting resources from AISI now is seen as incredibly short-sighted, especially when: AI Risks are Escalating: As AI models become more powerful and integrated into various aspects of life, the potential risks – from bias and misuse to unforeseen consequences – are also growing. Global Race in AI: Nations worldwide are investing heavily in AI research and development. Weakening the US’s AI safety infrastructure could put the country at a disadvantage in the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies. Need for Standards: AISI’s role in developing standards and best practices for AI is crucial for ensuring interoperability, safety, and ethical considerations are built into AI systems from the ground up. Reduced capacity in this area could lead to fragmented and potentially unsafe AI development. The Broader Implications of NIST Layoffs for AI and Tech While the focus is on the US AI Safety Institute , the reported NIST layoffs AI extend beyond just this single organization. NIST plays a vital role in numerous sectors, including technology, manufacturing, and cybersecurity. Cuts of this magnitude could have ripple effects across various critical areas: NIST Area Potential Impact of Cuts AI Safety Research Slowdown in research, reduced capacity to identify and mitigate AI risks. Chips for America Potential delays or scaling back of initiatives to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing. Technology Standards Development Slower development of crucial technology standards, impacting innovation and interoperability. Cybersecurity Weakened cybersecurity research and standards, potentially increasing vulnerability to cyber threats. These potential cuts raise serious questions about the direction of Government AI safety policy and the prioritization of technological safety and regulation in the current political climate. Are we sacrificing long-term safety and responsible innovation for short-term budget savings? Navigating the Uncertain Future of AI Safety The situation surrounding the US AI Safety Institute is fluid and concerning. While the reports of layoffs are still developing, the potential consequences for AI safety and regulation are significant. It underscores the ongoing tension between fostering innovation and ensuring responsible technological development. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, the implications are also relevant. AI is increasingly intertwined with blockchain technology, from enhancing security and efficiency to powering new decentralized applications. A robust and well-regulated AI ecosystem is essential for the continued growth and trust in decentralized technologies. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining the extent of these cuts and their lasting impact on the AI regulation impact and the future of AI safety in the US.

Similarly, the burgeoning field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) faces its own tests of credibility, especially when it comes to AI benchmarks . This week, a public spat erupted, echoing the crypto world’s demand for accountability, as an OpenAI employee publicly questioned the integrity of xAI , Elon Musk’s AI venture, accusing them of presenting potentially misleading benchmarks for their latest model, Grok 3. Was xAI truly showcasing Grok 3’s capabilities accurately, or were these AI benchmarks designed to paint a rosier picture? Let’s delve into this fascinating AI showdown. The Benchmark Battleground: Are Grok 3’s Claims Valid? The heart of the controversy lies in how AI benchmarks are reported, and more crucially, interpreted. xAI , aiming to position Grok 3 as a leading AI, released a blog post highlighting its performance on the AIME 2025 (American Invitational Mathematics Examination) dataset. This dataset, despite some debates about its suitability as a definitive AI benchmark , is widely used to gauge a model’s mathematical reasoning prowess. xAI’s initial graph touted two versions of Grok 3 – Grok 3 Reasoning Beta and Grok 3 mini Reasoning – as outperforming OpenAI’s ‘o3-mini-high’ model on AIME 2025. However, this claim quickly drew fire from OpenAI insiders on X (formerly Twitter). The crux of their argument? The graph conveniently omitted a critical detail: ‘cons@64’ scores for OpenAI’s model. What is ‘cons@64’ and Why Does It Matter for AI Benchmarks? For those unfamiliar, ‘cons@64’ is short for ‘consensus@64.’ Imagine giving an AI model 64 attempts to solve each problem in a benchmark. ‘cons@64’ essentially does this, selecting the most frequently generated answers as the model’s final responses. This method can significantly inflate benchmark scores, making a model appear more capable than it might be in a single-attempt scenario. Think of it like this: @1 (Single Attempt): This reflects the model’s performance on its first try – arguably a more realistic measure of its immediate capability. cons@64 (64 Attempts Consensus): This shows the model’s potential best performance after multiple tries, leveraging statistical probability to arrive at the ‘best’ answer. By not including the ‘cons@64’ score for o3-mini-high, xAI’s graph potentially created a skewed comparison, suggesting Grok 3 surpassed OpenAI’s model when, in reality, the picture might be more nuanced. Grok 3 vs. OpenAI: Decoding the Benchmark Data Looking at the ‘@1’ scores, the initial performance metric, reveals a different story. Grok 3 Reasoning Beta and Grok 3 mini Reasoning actually fall short of o3-mini-high’s score on AIME 2025. Furthermore, Grok 3 Reasoning Beta even slightly lags behind OpenAI’s ‘o1’ model, even when the ‘o1’ model is set to ‘medium’ computing resources. Despite these figures, xAI is actively marketing Grok 3 as the “world’s smartest AI.” This bold claim, juxtaposed with the benchmark data nuances, raises eyebrows and fuels the debate about transparency in AI marketing. Was xAI’s Benchmark Presentation Misleading? Igor Babushkin, a co-founder of xAI , defended the company’s approach on X, arguing that OpenAI has also, in the past, presented misleading benchmarks – albeit in charts comparing their own models. This tit-for-tat highlights a broader issue: the lack of standardized and transparent practices in reporting AI benchmarks across the industry. Adding another layer to the discussion, a neutral observer, Teortaxes (@teortaxesTex on X), compiled a more comprehensive graph. This graph included ‘cons@64’ scores for a wider range of models, providing a more balanced perspective. Hilarious how some people see my plot as attack on OpenAI and others as attack on Grok while in reality it’s DeepSeek propaganda (I actually believe Grok looks good there, and openAI’s TTC chicanery behind o3-mini-*high*-pass@”””1″””” deserves more scrutiny.) pic.twitter.com/3WH8FOUfic — Teortaxes (DeepSeek 推特 铁粉 2023 – ∞) (@teortaxesTex) February 20, 2025 This neutral graph aimed to present a clearer picture, though it inadvertently sparked further debate, showcasing the sensitivity and complexity surrounding AI benchmark comparisons. The Missing Piece: Computational Cost in AI Benchmarks AI researcher Nathan Lambert brought up a crucial, often overlooked, point. He highlighted that the computational and financial resources required for each model to achieve its benchmark scores remain largely undisclosed. This lack of transparency is a significant limitation of current AI benchmarks . A model might achieve a high score, but at what cost? Is it computationally efficient, or does it require massive resources, making it less practical for real-world applications? Consider these questions: Efficiency: How much computing power does each model consume to reach its benchmark score? Cost: What is the financial implication of running each model at scale? Practicality: Is a high-scoring but resource-intensive model truly superior to a slightly lower-scoring, but far more efficient, alternative? Without this crucial context of computational cost, AI benchmarks offer an incomplete picture of a model’s true capabilities and limitations. Navigating the AI Benchmark Maze: What Does This Mean for the Future? The Grok 3 benchmark controversy underscores a critical need for greater transparency and standardization in the AI industry. For users, investors, and the broader public to make informed decisions about AI technologies, we need AI benchmarks that are: Comprehensive: Going beyond single scores to include various performance metrics and contexts. Transparent: Clearly outlining testing methodologies, including details like ‘cons@64’ and computational costs. Standardized: Adhering to industry-wide accepted protocols to ensure fair comparisons across different models and labs. The debate surrounding Grok 3’s misleading benchmarks serves as a potent reminder: scrutiny and critical evaluation are essential, not just in the crypto space, but also in the rapidly evolving world of Artificial Intelligence. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into our lives, demanding clarity and honesty in performance claims is more important than ever. The future of AI hinges not just on technological advancement, but also on building trust and accountability within the industry.

He argued that Argentina is willing to have a mutual free trade deal with the United States, saying its only hindrance is its membership ties to Mercosur, the South American trade bloc. He commented : “I want to take this chance to announce that Argentina wants to be the first country in the world to join this reciprocal accord that the Trump administration proposed on trade matters.” – Javier Milei Argentina’s Milei endorsed Trump’s reciprocal tariff plans Javier Milei met with Donald Trump on the sidelines of the CPAC conference and showed support for the billionaire’s reciprocal tariff plans, which many other countries have seemingly criticized. According to the Argentine government, the two also spoke about the economic measures Milei is advancing in his country and how crucial it is for both countries to collaborate with each other. Moreover, during his speech at the conference, the Argentine president repeatedly endorsed some of Trump’s strategies while bashing what he called “a political class with a God complex.” He also promised to work together with countries that share his vision of freedom and want to root out state bureaucracy, seeing Trump as one of his ideological allies. Aside from Trump, Milei also met with Tesla CEO Elon Musk and even handed him a chainsaw, his government’s symbol of ending state bureaucracy. He also talked with International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva about an IMF loan, which he believes could help grow his country’s economy. Milei is still under investigation for marketing a suspicious meme token While the Argentine leader is seemingly showing more interest in his relationship with the US, he is facing corruption allegations and is currently under investigation for promoting a rather speculative crypto coin. Just after its launch, Milei posted about the LIBRA meme coin on X on the grounds that he wanted to support growing businesses and startups. His post quickly encouraged a price surge for the token, bringing its market valuation to over $4 billion. However, as traders started to withdraw their assets, the token collapsed, with analysts saying the coin showed all the signs of a rug pull. The LIBRA crypto scandal is now locally known as “cryptogate”, with a few influential characters involved, including a 28-year-old American entrepreneur who helped launch First Lady Melania Trump’s meme coin. Meanwhile, the libertarian president distanced himself from the crypto project soon after its dip, even deleting his initial X post, but he did ask the Justice Ministry’s Anti-Corruption Office to investigate the case. Milei and five more others, however, are currently under probe for creating and marketing the token and possible crimes of fraud, abuse of authority, and bribes.

In line with this, he revealed price levels to watch for as DOGE eyes a bullish breakout. Levels To Watch For As Dogecoin Price Confirms Final Retest In a TradingView post, Basic Trading highlighted $0.2, $0.5, and $5 as the levels to watch out for as the Dogecoin price confirms a final retest. This came as the analyst noted that market participants are about to witness a textbook ‘break and retest’ for Dogecoin. Alluding to the monthly chart, the analyst said that DOGE is obviously in an upward trend despite recent corrections. Related Reading: Dogecoin $10 Price Target Back In Play? Here’s What The Charts Say Basic Trading also remarked that the Dogecoin price has seen the expected correction of about 50% following its textbook retest of the previous all-time high about three months ago. The analyst is confident that the foremost meme coin is about to confirm the bullish break and retest, which would eventually lead to a parabolic rally and new highs. He predicts that DOGE will witness significant buy pressure, pushing the Dogecoin price to its current local high of around $0.5. This potential breakout would pave the way for a rally to a new ATH. Basic Trading believes that the foremost meme coin can rally to as high as $5 because of its performance in previous cycles. The analyst noted that the Dogecoin price enjoyed an 8,000% gain in the 2017 bull cycle and a 50,000% in the 2021 cycle. As such, he believes the $5 price level is a conservative target for DOGE in this bull run. Crypto analyst Dima Potts also recently predicted that Dogecoin could reach $10 in this cycle as it is mirroring a similar pattern from the 2017 bull cycle. $3 Remains A Strong Possibility For DOGE In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed how the Dogecoin price could rally to as high as $3 in this market cycle. He noted that the most critical support zone for DOGE is between $0.19 and $0.16. According to him, if this level holds, the $3 target remains a strong possibility for the foremost meme coin. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Knocks Off Second Major Correction, When Will The Recovery To $1 Resume? Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade also provided a bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price. In an X post, he stated that DOGE’s macro chart is showing a similar price pattern. The analyst remarked that if it mirrors the 2017 moves, DOGE could soon experience another massive surge. His accompanying chart showed that the meme coin could reach $1.7 when this massive surge happens. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.25, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM), priced at $0.01 during the first stage, has already sold 94% of its initial allocation, indicating strong investor demand. Early participants have limited time to lock in this entry point before the token price climbs by 50% in the next round. Analysts predict a 600% gain at the planned $0.06 launch valuation, while a longer-term target of $1 in 2025 suggests a 100x opportunity. Established tokens like Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) are charting slower growth, allowing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to stand out as a high-utility alternative poised to disrupt CoinMarketCap’s rankings. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance’s decentralized lending ecosystem combines peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer models, letting lenders earn passive income through liquidity pools while borrowers can post crypto collateral without liquidating their assets. This approach addresses prevalent challenges in the DeFi space, attracting attention from both individual and institutional investors. Phase 1 of the presale has already surpassed $1.03 million, with fewer than 6% of tokens remaining at $0.01. Early adopters can secure a guaranteed 6x return when MUTM debuts at $0.06. Beyond its listing, experts anticipate a rise toward $1 by 2025, reflecting a 100x multiple, underpinned by Mutuum’s fee framework: 20% of platform revenue automatically buys back MUTM on the open market, cultivating persistent demand and reinforcing the token’s price. Mutuum Finance isn’t reliant on hype. Audits for the project’s smart contracts are already complete, and a $100,000 giveaway will reward early supporters and boost community involvement. An upcoming stablecoin, anchored by on-chain reserves, adds stability to the ecosystem, facilitating smoother lending transactions. With exchange listings arranged to coincide with the beta platform release, MUTM avoids the “vaporware” stigma that often plagues other presale tokens. Investors recognize the potential and are quickly purchasing tokens, aware that each presale phase narrows profit margins for later entrants. The $0.01 price in Phase 1 represents the best chance to maximize returns before incremental price increases lead to a $0.06 launch valuation. For instance, a $1,500 investment now could net $9,000 at launch, and if MUTM reaches $1, that same stake might be worth $150,000. This is a rare risk-reward dynamic in today’s crypto market. Mounting Competition for ADA and XRP As Mutuum Finance captures more market share, it diverts capital away from legacy tokens like Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP). Combining straightforward tokenomics, real-world use cases, and proactive buyback mechanisms, MUTM looks set to challenge mainstream altcoins in CoinMarketCap’s top 10. While ADA and XRP cope with incremental obstacles, Mutuum Finance’s presale achievements and expansive growth plans suggest a reshuffling of market rankings could be imminent. With under 6% of Phase 1 tokens remaining at $0.01—and a 50% price increase looming in Phase 2—waiting may mean missing the most favorable entry point. Join the more than 2,000 current investors who are positioning themselves for major gains in 2025. Visit Mutuum Finance’s official website to secure MUTM tokens now, before the chance to invest at $0.01 disappears.

40717452,https://coinpedia.org/?p=423718,1740290605,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Solana Price Prediction After Libra Scandal; New Token Shines,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/solana-price-prediction-after-libra-scandal-new-token-shines/,"The post Solana Price Prediction After Libra Scandal; New Token Shines appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Solana price has crashed this week and is on the verge of more downside as concerns about meme coins in the ecosystem jumps. The SOL token plunged to $160 this week, and is about to form the highly-risky death cross chart pattern on the daily chart. So, what next for Solana as market experts move to Minotaurus (MTAUR) ? Solana price forecast Solana, one of the biggest players in the crypto industry, has crashed into a bear market, falling from near $300 to $173. This coin has more downside as it is about to form a death cross pattern, which happens when the 200-day and 50-day moving averages flip each other. Solana also formed a double-top chart pattern at $264, and whose neckline was at $170. A double-top is one of the most bearish patterns in technical analysis. It has also moved below the Ichimoku cloud indicator. Additionally, Solana fell below the crucial ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since August 5 last year. Moving below that level is a sign that market participants expect it to crash much further in the next few months. Therefore, there is a likelihood that Solana price will drop to $110 in this bear market cycle. Such a crash would imply a 37% plunge from the current level. On the other hand, a move above the resistance level at $203, the 50-day moving average, will invalidate the bearish outlook. Why SOL price is imploding There are two main reasons why the Solana price is crashing. First, the drop happened because of the ongoing plunge of other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has dropped from $109,300 to $95,000, while most tokens like Cardano and Tron are in a steep bear market. Second, Solana has crashed because of the prevalence of meme coins in its ecosystem. Most of the recently launched meme coins have all plunged, costing many participants billions and making insiders millions. The best examples of this are Official Trump and Libra, which was promoted by Javier Milei. All this has led to concerns that Solana is a scam blockchain. It has also led to a sharp plunge of the volume handled by its DEX protocols. Experts flock to Minotaurus Crypto experts, fearful of the ongoing woes on Solana, have flocked to Minotaurus, an upcoming player in the gaming industry. Minotarus developers are creating a game that will be available on Android and iOS. It will be a simple-to-play game that millions of users are expected to enjoy. Minotaurus has already crossed the 1.75 million USDT mark in presale token sales in the past few weeks, and the momentum is gaining steam. This trajectory is happening because many of the participants know its potential. For one, it is in the blockchain and leisure gaming industry that has a total addressable market or TAM of over $50 billion.Participants are also buying the MTAUR token because of the promising upward path during presale. The MTAUR token is now priced at 0.00010518, much lower than the eventual listing price of 0.000200. Users also stand a chance to win big through the 100,000 USDT giveaway. So, hurry up and buy the Minotaurus token here .",Sponsored,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-23 06:03:25

While COLD is gaining traction in niche sectors, Lightchain AI is drawing massive investor interest with its blockchain and AI integration, offering long-term growth potential. The Lightchain AI Presale has already raised over $15.6 million at a presale price of $0.006, signaling strong confidence in its future. As investors seek the next big opportunity, Lightchain AI’s innovative approach could position it as a top-performing asset in the next major bull run. COLD- What Analysts Are Saying About its Potential Americold Realty Trust Inc. (NYSE; COLD) is a leading real estate investment trust specializing in temperature-controlled warehouses. Analysts currently maintain a cautiously optimistic outlook on the company’s potential. According to The Wall Street Journal, the consensus rating for COLD is Overweight, with an average price target of $28.00. TipRanks reports a similar sentiment, noting 14 Buy ratings and 7 Hold ratings in the past month. Factors contributing to this positive sentiment include Americold’s strategic acquisitions and its pivotal role in the global cold storage supply chain. However, analysts also caution about potential risks such as market volatility and operational challenges. Investors are advised to monitor these dynamics closely when considering COLD as a potential investment. Lightchain AI- What Sets it Apart for 1000X Gains Lightchain AI is emerging as a top contender for exponential growth, with Dynamic Resource Allocation and low latency setting it apart from traditional blockchain projects. Dynamic Resource Allocation optimizes computational power by distributing AI workloads across network nodes based on their processing capacity.

Additionally, low latency is a key advantage of Lightchain AI, allowing real-time AI execution without delays. Its optimized architecture ensures near-instant transaction verification and AI model deployment, making it suitable for high-speed decentralized applications. These innovations position Lightchain AI as a groundbreaking project with the potential for massive 1000X gains. Invest in Lightchain AI – Leading Future of AI and Blockchain As the world becomes increasingly reliant on AI and blockchain technologies, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a disruptive force in both industries. Its innovative approach and strong investor confidence make it an attractive investment for long-term growth potential.

40718660,https://timestabloid.com/?p=58258,1740291352,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple Price Forecast: Why XRP Holders Are Rotating to 2025’s Best Crypto Presale As 50% Bonus Goes Live,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-price-forecast-why-xrp-holders-are-rotating-to-2025s-best/,"Ripple (XRP) momentum has cooled considerably in recent weeks, leading many holders to question what the future might hold. A growing number have shifted their focus to Rollblock (RBLK), the new Web3 gaming platform poised for explosive growth this year. With a recent 600% spike in new users, analysts predict a possible 50x rally for RBLK this year, making it one of the most compelling crypto opportunities of 2025. Rollblock (RBLK) Doubles Down With Startling 50% Token Bonus While many crypto gaming projects fail to gain a foothold in the industry, Rollblock ( RBLK ) is proving its staying power with its rapidly growing community. December marked a breakthrough for Rollblock with a staggering 600% increase in new gamers joining the platform and a total of $1.75 million in wagered bids being placed . Clearly, the Rollblock mission to bring transparency back to gaming is paying off and attracting huge numbers each day. The platform offers over 7,000 games, all powered by the latest AI technology and uniting the community with live dealer modes and PVP settings. The newly launched sports prediction league has also proven exceptionally popular with armchair sports pundits. Rollblock now supports fiat deposits via Apple Pay, Google Pay and Mastercard, improving access for users around the world. Every transaction is securely recorded onto the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring full transparency and allowing gamers to verify every payout on chain. Rollblock’s deflationary revenue-sharing model marks the token out from the majority of gaming cash grabs. The platform allocates up to 30% of its revenue to buy back RBLK, with 60% of these tokens permanently burned and 40% distributed to stakers who can earn up to 30% APY. Its popular presale has already raised more than $10.5 million in investor inflows and is rapidly selling out of stage 10 tokens at $0.06. Investors can also capitalize on a phenomenal 50% limited-time bonus for all RBLK purchases this week, making now the perfect time to build a position. Ripple (XRP): Regulatory Battles Amid ETF Approvals Ripple (XRP) continues to face uncertainty due to its ongoing legal battle with the SEC. Despite recent court rulings favoring Ripple, sentiment has remained mixed and trading volumes have fallen sharply in recent weeks. Ripple is currently trading around $2.54 after losing 7% this week. The monthly time frame looks even more severe, with a 20% drawdown in the last 30 days. On the adoption front, the launch of Hashdex’s Ripple spot ETF in Brazil is a landmark step for Ripple. This will open up walls of institutional capital to the Ripple ecosystem and makes the case for a similar US-based fund much more likely this year. Analysts are confident that Ripple could surge past $5 this year if adoption continues at current rates. Stage 10 RBLK Tokens Are Selling Fast – Don’t Miss Out While Ripple continues to navigate choppy trading waters, Rollblock ($RBLK) presents a far more attractive investment opportunity. As it races through its final presale stages, Rollblock is poised for massive growth, and investors should act quickly before the next price increase.

In a post , he stated, “XRP is quietly loading up for the next push to $7.20. Many non-believers have been shaken out. We hold. And we will rise together.” His statement reflects the confidence of many long-term investors despite the market’s volatility. Many prominent figures have reiterated the importance of holding XRP, as they expect its price to shake out many weak retail investors, before reaching its true potential. $XRP is quietly loading up for the next push to $7.20 Many non believers have been shaken out. We hold. And we will rise together — Crypto Bitlord (@crypto_bitlord7) February 22, 2025 The digital asset’s rise over the past few months has made it more difficult to become a top holder, and it will only get worse as its price increases. XRP Army Weighs In Following this post, the XRP community responded with mixed reactions. Some traders agreed with Crypto Bitlord’s projection, while others questioned the rationale behind the specific $7.20 target. One user supported the sentiment, replying , “Yes my man, soon.” Others shared similar enthusiasm, with one commenter stating , “In $XRP we believe” and another writing , “Be patient and watch it rise.” Other users proposed alternative price levels. one said , “Make it $10,” while another suggested it could reach $25, $50, and eventually $150. More extreme projections also surfaced, with one commenter writing , “$XRP to $589,” reflecting the high expectations among investors. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Despite the optimism, some community members challenged the prediction. One user questioned the $7.20 target, calling Crypto Bitlord out for not explaining the reasoning behind the target. Notably, other analysts have set targets around $8 for XRP, and as one commenter pointed out , the $7.20 target is most likely derived from key levels on the XRP chart, even though Crypto Bitlord did not share that chart. Can XRP Reach This Target? Various factors drive speculation about XRP’s price increase. Some investors believe regulatory clarity will be a key catalyst, as recent reports suggest that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will soon dismiss its lawsuit against Ripple. The regulator has already agreed to dismiss the Coinbase lawsuit and is awaiting approval from its commissioners. This development, combined with the recent shift in the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation, has convinced many experts that the end of the Ripple lawsuit is around the corner. This dismissal could push XRP toward $7.2 and potentially beyond. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Among them, Skyren DAO stands out as the first airdrop collection DAO, designed to maximize rewards by strategically farming airdrops from emerging projects. With AI-driven governance, high-yield staking, and a focus on delivering value across multiple ecosystems, Skyren is gaining strong momentum. Its innovative approach ensures Bitcoin and Qubetics holders benefit from new opportunities, making it a standout project in the 2025 DeFi landscape. How Skyren is Delivering Value to Bitcoin and Qubetics Holders Airdrops have long been a powerful tool in the crypto space, rewarding early adopters and fostering community growth. However, Skyren’s Token Surge is taking this concept to the next level by specifically targeting presale participants from select projects, including Bitcoin and Qubetics holders. Token Surge: A New Standard in Airdrops Unlike traditional airdrops that randomly distribute tokens, Skyren’s Token Surge is designed to ensure maximum engagement and value. Here’s why it stands out: Exclusive Eligibility – Only users who participated in specific projects, including Bitcoin and Qubetics, are eligible. Guaranteed Rewards – Each qualifying participant receives 500 SKYRN tokens, giving them access to Skyren’s high-yield staking and governance ecosystem. Extended Claim Period – Holders have until June 2025 to claim their tokens, allowing flexibility in participation. Secure Verification – The airdrop process ensures security by requiring only public blockchain data and a simple verification step. For Bitcoin holders, this means exposure to one of the most promising DeFi projects without needing to buy additional tokens. Qubetics holders, on the other hand, can leverage their participation to access Skyren’s superior earning mechanisms, setting Skyren apart from the general Web3 aggregated ecosystems like Qubetics. By offering targeted airdrops, Skyren attracts engaged and knowledgeable investors, reinforcing its goal of building a thriving DeFi ecosystem. Skyren: A DeFi Innovation with Unmatched Potential Beyond the Token Surge program, Skyren is setting a new industry standard through its unique approach to airdrop farming, AI-powered governance, and multi-ecosystem staking rewards.

AI-Driven Governance & Decentralization One of Skyren’s standout features is its AI-powered governance system, which enhances decision-making within the DAO. Instead of relying on centralized entities, Skyren’s AI helps optimize airdrop collection strategies, staking rewards, and liquidity allocation, ensuring that SKYRN holders always receive the best possible returns. 3. High-Yield Staking & Reward Maximization Unlike typical staking models, Skyren offers multi-layered staking opportunities. By staking SKYRN tokens, holders not only earn rewards from standard DeFi mechanisms like lending and liquidity pools but also benefit from airdrops collected from dozens of upcoming projects. 4. A Thriving Ecosystem with a Massive ROI Potential With Phase 2 of the presale now live, Skyren is positioned for explosive growth. Here’s why early investors are flocking to the project: Current Presale Price: $0.03 (Next Phase: $0.04) Launch Price: $0.15 Total Tokens: 11,000,000 SKYRN Projected ROI: 500% As more investors recognize Skyren’s value proposition, demand for SKYRN tokens is expected to skyrocket, further boosting its price potential. Why Crypto Experts Are Calling Skyren a Game-Changer Skyren’s disruptive approach to DeFi has earned it widespread recognition. From top influencers to DeFi analysts, the project is being hailed as one of the most innovative crypto ventures of 2025. Crypto Volt , a well-known DeFi YouTuber, recently called Skyren a “Game Changer”. Other influencers have praised Skyren’s airdrops strategy, high-yield staking, and AI-driven governance. With multiple audits confirming its security, Skyren has earned the trust of crypto investors and analysts alike. In addition, the Skyren DAO Telegram group is your space to interact with the community, receive direct help from the team, and access updates as they happen Conclusion Skyren isn’t just another DeFi project—it’s a game-changing ecosystem that maximizes investor returns through strategic airdrop farming, AI governance, and high-yield staking. For Bitcoin and Qubetics holders, its Token Surge program offers exposure to this innovative model without additional investment. With a presale underway, early adopters can secure SKYRN tokens at a discount before its $0.15 launch.

While they offer massive hype-driven gains, Avalanche, Sui, and 1Fuel (OFT) provide real utility and long-term potential. With AI-driven trading and cross-chain functionality, 1Fuel has already raised over $2.3 million in its ICO. Sui (SUI) gains momentum as DeFi expansion accelerates Despite dropping to $3.42, Sui (SUI) remains a key player in blockchain innovation, with rapid network development and growing DeFi integration. The recent native USDC support and Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol have strengthened its role in fast, efficient transactions, attracting both traders and developers looking for scalable blockchain solutions. Beyond short-term price action, SUI’s object-centric data model and Move programming language make it a top choice for next-generation dApps. With a 96 percent year-to-date gain, institutional interest is rising, fueled by strong fundamentals and increasing adoption. As SUI expands its DeFi ecosystem, its impact on Web3 payments and blockchain interoperability is becoming even clearer. Analysts predict Sui could reach $5 soon as demand for high-performance, cross-chain blockchain solutions continues to grow. Thus, Sui is one of the most promising assets in the market. Avalanche (AVAX) gains momentum as adoption grows Avalanche (AVAX) is displaying bearish momentum despite dipping to $25 with a 2% loss on the daily charts. Avalanche’s latest network upgrade has cut transaction fees by 75%, making it a more scalable and low-cost Layer 1 blockchain. This improvement is drawing in brand new interest from developers searching for a performant and affordable blockchain system. Beyond technical upgrades, Avalanche is looking toward real-world applications. A partnership with Karnataka’s Seva Sindhu platform, which is now running, adds blockchain-powered digital services to huge numbers of users. This expanding adoption positions Avalanche as a pioneer in real-world blockchain integration. However, analysts remain optimistic, with several setting a $53 price target for Avalanche as institutional and developer interest rises. With low-cost transactions and increasing Web3 adoption, Avalanche seeks to maintain its long-term development and become a vital participant in the blockchain community. 1Fuel: The high-potential crypto bridging decentralized trading and real-world finance 1Fuel enables cross-chain decentralized trading where users swap assets across several blockchains. This particular innovation offers much more liquidity, particularly for lesser-known coins, thus boosting trading and market activity. Beyond cross-chain trading, 1Fuel integrates AI-powered tools and a P2P exchange, making it easier to trade small-cap assets directly with preferred parties. Unlike platforms that restrict users to a single ecosystem, 1Fuel expands market access across multiple blockchains, increasing flexibility and efficiency. Further expanding real-world use cases, 1Fuel is launching a crypto wallet and debit card. These allow users to spend digital assets anywhere Visa and Mastercard are accepted. This bridges the gap between crypto and traditional finance, boosting liquidity and accessibility. With just 24 hours left to accumulate 1Fuel, investors can still take advantage of the 40% bonus before the presale closes. Analysts predict a 100x rally, making this a prime opportunity before the price surge. If the presale surpasses $3 million, 1Fuel’s Beta Wallet launch could go live, offering eligible investors even bigger rewards. With over $2.3 million already raised, 1Fuel is providing early investors with an ideal entry point. Priced at just $0.018 per token, it stands out as one of the market’s most affordable, high-potential investments. As the best meme coin of 2025 gains momentum, 1Fuel is proving to be a serious contender for long-term growth.

However, this article will look into Berachain, XRP, and ChowWow tokens, which are making waves in the market and are backed for massive returns in 2025. Although in the early stage of the presale, ChowWow is showing signs similar to the early stage of Pepe, which has triggered positive predictions. Given the rising adoption, the CHOW meme coin is expected to rise as high as 12,000% within weeks of launch, similar to that of Dogwifhat in 2024. Can Berachain Coin Hit $20 Soon? Berachain (BERA) has continued to witness positive price action in recent weeks. According to Defillama , the Berachain ecosystem total value locked (TVL) has surpassed $3B, showcasing the growing adoption of the network. Regarding market performance, the Berachain price soared by 47% in the past week, as per CoinMarketCap , with over 700% gains since the mainnet launch on February 6th. Top crypto analyst Dr. Ritika Singhal is bullish about the Berachain crypto. While analyzing the Berachain price chart on X, Singhal thinks that as long as the Bitcoin price is stable, the BERA price will rise towards the target of $6.50, $7.30, and $8.20. Stats from Emperor Osmo show that the inflow into the Berachain network surpassed that of HYPE and Arbitrum in the past week, showcasing its rising adoption. Backed by its Proof of Liquidity (PoL) mechanism, which allows users to stake and provide liquidity simultaneously for rewards, the ecosystem is developing at a faster pace, which will trigger massive interest in the BERA coin. In their Berachain price prediction for the short term, experts at Coincodex forecast a rise to $27.44. Experts Bullish on XRP’s Price Outlook in the Coming Months Having held the $3.84 all-time high for the past 7 years, the XRP price might break the record in the coming weeks. CoinMarketCap data shows that XRP coin is still among the cryptos trading above the early November lows when the Q4 market rally started. Although the Ripple price has dipped by 17% in the past month, the YTD price metrics show over 390% growth. In a tweet on X, Steph is Crypto claims that XRP will produce crypto millionaires in the year. In a similar view, popular analyst Crypto Beast thinks that the XRP coin price will hit $10 soon as the news of the ETF filing continues to make waves in the market. However, the technical analysis of the past weeks doesn’t look good, with key market indicators dipping. While studying the XRP price chart, Ali Martinez claims that the TD sequential indicator flashed a buy signal in the hourly candlestick barely a few days after the analyst projected a rise to $4 in a similar tweet . Given its rising adoption, XRP is one of the altcoins to buy and HODL. ChowWow: The New Memecoin Star Set to Transform the Solana Blockchain With the Solana network facing issues of rug pool, ChowWow is on a mission to transform the chain by launching a meme coin backed by two core features — play to earn and stake to earn. In the P2E platform, users will engage in a gaming adventure to garner points that are converted into real-world assets. The staking program gives non-gamers the opportunity to stake their tokens and earn as much as 15% in APY rewards, which will be paid monthly. Unlike other meme coins like Dogecoin with no fixed supply, ChowWow has a strict supply of 888.77 million, of which 5% is allocated for community activities and airdrops on launch. Also, 50% is earmarked for presale. As a project inspired by the Chinese Chow Chow dog breed, which is believed to extol luck and fortune, ChowWow is on a mission to promote financial freedom for the masses. Outside of the two main features, users can earn by engaging in the ongoing ChowWow meme competition with a $1000 USDT price pool. There is also an ongoing bonus offer for investors who buy more than $250 CHOW tokens. That means the more tokens you buy, the higher the bonus offer. Given that CHOW is currently being sold for just $0.008, investors can accumulate the meme coin without breaking the bank. Features like the deflationary mechanism, which ensures regular token burn and buyback, will likely drive the price up. As such, CHOW is one of the best meme coins to watch out for in 2025. What are the Top Cryptos for Explosive Growth in 2025? Although the crypto market is highly volatile, Berachain and XRP are good cryptos to buy for short and long-term gains. As for ChowWow, its growing community will lead to more investor inflow, which will trigger buying pressure. With its deflationary mechanism, the upcoming scarcity will boost the price. Its gaming and staking models are also appealing and could drive more users to the platform. Overall, it is one of the meme coins to watch in 2025.

Zhao explained that he would not be keeping any of the funds for himself, and asked for suggestions on how best to allocate them. “I will not keep any tokens for myself.

Mike Novogratz, a billionaire investor and finance expert, recently discussed why the asset has maintained relevance, pointing to a crucial factor many overlook. While Novogratz was once skeptical about XRP’s long-term prospects, he has since revised his stance. He admitted that he was “ dead wrong ” about the digital asset, and now believes that the strength of its community, rather than just its technology or market position, has been the driving force behind its endurance. His latest remarks came during an episode of the Galaxy Brains podcast, where he analyzed how different cryptocurrencies have performed and why some have retained value better than others. Ethereum’s Struggles and the Role of Community During the discussion, host Alex Thorn brought up Ethereum’s weakening position against Bitcoin. He noted that Ethereum had lost 75% of its value relative to Bitcoin since the Merge and an additional 50% since Ethereum ETFs were announced in mid-2024 . This led to the question of when Ethereum’s downward trend might reverse. Novogratz responded by contrasting Bitcoin and Ethereum. He argued that Bitcoin’s strength lies in its straightforward identity as digital gold, a narrative that has remained consistent over time. Its value, he explained, is largely based on collective belief rather than just technological advancements. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ethereum, on the other hand, presents a more complex case. While it functions as a decentralized trust layer, its value proposition has been challenged by the rising number of alternative blockchain platforms. Novogratz pointed out that the constant influx of new tokens has made it harder for Ethereum and many other altcoins to build and sustain strong communities. In his view, the oversaturation of the market has diluted the attention and support that individual projects receive. Why XRP Has Maintained Relevance XRP and Cardano have remained relevant due to their early entry into the crypto space, allowing them to build strong, loyal communities before the market became crowded. Novogratz, who once doubted XRP’s longevity due to Ripple’s control over its supply, has now acknowledged the power of its dedicated supporters . He emphasized that community engagement is a key factor in a cryptocurrency’s success, noting that he had underestimated XRP’s resilience and its late 2024 price surge following Trump’s election.

40719029,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=133132,1740293492,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Exposed: Lazarus Group’s Shocking $1.46B Ethereum Laundering After Bybit Hack,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/lazarus-group-ethereum-bybit-hack/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The plot thickens in the world of digital assets as a staggering $1.46 billion Ethereum heist linked to the Bybit exchange is now under the spotlight. Blockchain sleuth ZachXBT, the very person who initially raised alarms about the Bybit incident, has dropped another bombshell: the infamous Lazarus Group is allegedly behind a massive money laundering operation, moving a mountain of stolen Ethereum . Let’s dive deep into this unfolding saga and unpack what it means for the crypto sphere. Unveiling the Ethereum Laundering Operation: How Did It Unfold? According to a tweet by Wu Blockchain, citing ZachXBT’s findings, the Lazarus Group, a notorious cybercriminal syndicate with ties to North Korea, didn’t just vanish with the Ethereum pilfered from Bybit. Instead, they appear to have embarked on a sophisticated laundering mission. Here’s a breakdown of the alleged money trail: Initial Transfer: A whopping 5,000 ETH, part of the massive $1.46 billion haul, was moved to a fresh, previously inactive address. This is a classic tactic to obscure the origin of funds. Mixer Magic: The 5,000 ETH then entered eXch, a cryptocurrency mixer. Mixers are designed to obfuscate the transaction history of cryptocurrencies, making it incredibly difficult to trace the funds back to their source. Think of it as a digital washing machine for crypto. Bridging to Bitcoin: From the mixer, the laundered Ethereum was bridged to Bitcoin (BTC) using Chainflip. This cross-chain transfer further complicates tracking, as it moves the assets to a different blockchain altogether. This intricate process showcases the Lazarus Group’s expertise in not just hacking, but also in the art of financial subterfuge within the crypto ecosystem. But why is this significant, and what does it mean for Bybit and the wider crypto world? Why is the Bybit Hack and Ethereum Laundering a Big Deal? The scale of the Bybit hack is truly colossal. Losing $1.46 billion in Ethereum is not a minor security breach; it’s a catastrophic event for any exchange. Here’s why this incident and the subsequent laundering attempts are causing ripples across the crypto community: Trust Erosion: Hacks of this magnitude shake user confidence in cryptocurrency exchanges. If a platform like Bybit, presumably with robust security measures, can fall victim to such an attack, it raises serious questions about the security of other exchanges and the safety of user funds. Regulatory Scrutiny: Incidents like these often trigger increased regulatory pressure on the crypto industry. Governments and financial watchdogs are already concerned about illicit activities in crypto, and a billion-dollar hack will only intensify calls for stricter regulations and oversight. Market Impact: While the immediate market impact might be diluted due to the overall size of the crypto market, such large-scale thefts can contribute to market volatility and negative sentiment, especially if the laundered funds are eventually dumped onto exchanges. Blockchain Security Concerns: It highlights the ongoing battle between blockchain security experts and sophisticated cybercriminals. Despite the transparency of blockchain, mixers and cross-chain bridges are becoming tools to bypass traceability, posing a significant challenge to law enforcement and asset recovery efforts. Lazarus Group: Who Are These Master Crypto Launderers? The mention of the Lazarus Group sends shivers down the spine of cybersecurity professionals. This isn’t just any hacking group; they are a highly sophisticated, state-sponsored cybercriminal organization believed to be linked to North Korea. They are notorious for: State Sponsorship: Allegedly backed by the North Korean government, they operate with significant resources and a level of sophistication rarely seen in typical cybercrime. Financial Motivation: A primary goal is to generate revenue for the North Korean regime, which faces severe economic sanctions. Crypto theft has become a lucrative avenue for them to circumvent these sanctions. Advanced Techniques: They employ cutting-edge hacking tools and techniques, constantly evolving their methods to stay ahead of security measures. Their involvement in the Ethereum laundering operation further demonstrates their adaptability and skill in navigating the complexities of blockchain technology. Prolific Track Record: Lazarus Group has been linked to numerous high-profile cyberattacks and crypto heists over the years, establishing a fearsome reputation in the cybersecurity world. Actionable Insights: What Can We Learn and Do? The Bybit hack and subsequent Ethereum laundering attempt offer crucial lessons and call for proactive measures from various stakeholders: Enhanced Exchange Security: Cryptocurrency exchanges must continuously upgrade their security infrastructure, focusing on robust cold wallet protection, multi-signature schemes, and proactive threat intelligence to defend against advanced persistent threats like Lazarus Group. Regular security audits and penetration testing are no longer optional but essential. Improved On-Chain Analytics: Blockchain analysis firms and tools need to become even more sophisticated to track and deanonymize laundered funds effectively, especially as criminals utilize mixers and cross-chain bridges. Collaboration between exchanges, security firms, and law enforcement is paramount. User Awareness and Education: Crypto users must be educated about the risks associated with exchanges and the importance of diversification. While this hack targeted Bybit’s cold wallet, users should still practice good security hygiene, such as using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and being wary of phishing attempts. Regulatory Collaboration: Global regulatory bodies need to work together to establish clear frameworks for cryptocurrency security and anti-money laundering (AML). International cooperation is crucial to track down and prosecute cybercriminals operating across borders. The Future of Crypto Security: A Constant Arms Race? The Lazarus Group’s alleged involvement in the Bybit hack and Ethereum laundering underscores a sobering reality: the fight for cryptocurrency security is an ongoing arms race. As blockchain technology evolves and becomes more mainstream, so too do the tactics of cybercriminals. This incident serves as a stark reminder that: Complacency is dangerous: No cryptocurrency exchange, no matter how large or reputable, is immune to attacks. Continuous vigilance and proactive security measures are non-negotiable. Innovation in security is key: The crypto industry must constantly innovate in security technologies and methodologies to stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated threats. This includes exploring advanced cryptography, AI-powered threat detection, and decentralized security solutions. Community collaboration is vital: Sharing threat intelligence, best practices, and incident response strategies across the crypto community is crucial to collectively strengthen the ecosystem’s defenses. The Ethereum stolen from Bybit and the Lazarus Group’s alleged laundering efforts represent a significant challenge to the crypto world. It’s a call to action for exchanges, security experts, regulators, and users alike to double down on security, vigilance, and collaboration to safeguard the future of decentralized finance.

This development has prompted speculation within the XRP community about the potential impact on Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC, which is currently in the appeals process. As discussions intensified, former SEC Director John Reed Stark suggested that the agency might follow a similar course of action in Ripple’s case. Stark predicted that the SEC’s aggressive enforcement tactics would soon end , raising hopes that the long-standing legal dispute could be the next to go. Potential Resolution Timeline for Ripple v. SEC Attorney Jeremy Hogan, a well-known attorney and crypto enthusiast who has closely followed the lawsuit, offered his perspective on when a resolution might occur. Hogan had previously predicted that the legal battle would end in April or May but recently suggested it could happen sooner. Responding to a query on the timeline for dismissal, Hogan stated, “An earlier resolution is definitely in play, but I’m still thinking it might be May. May or the first half of April. Just a hunch.” An earlier resolution is definitely in play, but I'm still thinking it might be May. May or the first half of April. Just a hunch. — Jeremy Hogan (@attorneyjeremy1) February 22, 2025 We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 There is also a crucial deadline on April 16 for Ripple to file its opening brief in its cross-appeal against the SEC. The regulator may dismiss the appeal or agree with Ripple before this date to prevent the legal battle from proceeding. However, a dismissal may not be as straightforward as the Coinbase lawsuit. Legal Complexities Surrounding Ripple’s Case While some believe the SEC could choose to dismiss its appeal against Ripple in light of its decision on Coinbase, others argue that the cases are not directly comparable. Fox Business correspondent Eleanor Terrett highlighted the unique procedural challenges in Ripple’s case. Terrett pointed to the existing order from Judge Analisa Torres, which requires Ripple to pay a $125 million penalty . Terrett shared a portion of the final judgment stating that the court will retain jurisdiction over the case until August 7, 2025, ensuring that the terms of the order are followed. Given this, Terrett suggested that even if the SEC were to drop its appeal, the agency would need to address the district court’s penalty ruling. This could involve negotiating a reduction or requesting its removal, a process that would require the judge’s approval.

Crypto influencer XRP Captain (@UniverseTwenty) highlighted a transaction involving the transfer of 40 million XRP from an unidentified wallet to Bybit. JUST IN 40 Million #XRP Transferred From Unknown Wallet To #Bybit Anonymous Whale Just Gave Loan To Bybit ( #XRP Liquidity ) pic.twitter.com/sP7lCzx5k6 — XRP CAPTAIN (@UniverseTwenty) February 21, 2025 This development follows a recent hack that resulted in the loss of $1.46 billion in digital assets from Bybit, marking one of the largest cryptocurrency thefts. Bybit’s Security Breach On February 21, 2025, Bybit experienced a sophisticated cyberattack leading to the theft of over 400,000 Ethereum tokens, valued at approximately $1.46 billion. This attack came shortly after ByBit took a major initiative by making its liquidation data accessible to the public . The attackers manipulated the smart contract interface, gaining control of one of Bybit’s cold wallets and transferring its contents to an unknown address. Despite the magnitude of the theft, Bybit’s CEO, Ben Zhou, assured users that the exchange remains solvent and that all client assets are fully backed. He emphasized that unaffected wallets and withdrawal processes continue to operate normally. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The 40 Million XRP Transaction In the aftermath of the breach, a notable transaction was observed: 40 million XRP tokens were transferred from an unknown wallet to Bybit. While ByBit assured clients everything was fine, XRP Captain shared a screenshot of a report from Watcher Guru revealing that the exchange is accepting loans to cover withdrawals. While the purpose of this substantial transfer has not been officially disclosed, speculation within the community suggests that this influx of XRP is a loan to bolster Bybit’s liquidity following the recent security incident. Some community members took this further, with one commenter suggesting that this transfer was a loan from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. Another commenter claimed that Garlinghouse funded the $TRUMP token with $60 million, and argued that it was logical for him to support ByBit in this situation. Bybit’s Response and Recovery Efforts In response to the security breach, Bybit has initiated measures to recover the stolen assets and enhance its security framework. The exchange has announced a bounty program, pledging 10% of any recovered funds—potentially up to $140 million—to cybersecurity experts and blockchain analysts who assist in tracking and retrieving the stolen assets. While there has been no confirmation that the $40 million transfer was a loan, the transaction has drawn significant attention within the cryptocurrency community.

Already selling at $0.005, this rising star is fueling speculation about whether it could dominate markets within months. The recent surge in meme coins, coupled with bullish tron news and shifting Solana price trends, suggests SHIBI might be the next big thing. Its presale momentum, strong community and unique tokenomics are sparking discussions across crypto circles. As more investors take notice, could Panshibi be set for a breakout, or is it just another hype-driven trend? Tron News : TRX Holders Weigh Their Next Move as Markets Shift Tron (TRX) has been riding a wave of growing adoption, with its USDT balance creeping toward an all-time high . More stablecoins on the network mean more activity and that’s a sign of strength in a market where confidence can be fleeting. But while Tron news highlights its expanding ecosystem, investors are keeping a close eye on what comes next. Despite its strong fundamentals, TRX hasn’t been immune to market swings. It dipped 4.11% over the past 30 days. Right now, the Tron price hovers around $0.238063 , moving within a tight range as traders assess their next move. With meme coins like Panshibi shaking up the market, some TRX holders are wondering if it’s time to diversify. Solana Price : Should SOL Holders Brace for More Volatility or a Market Rebound? Solana (SOL) has been making headlines with major developments that could impact its market trajectory. Coinbase’s introduction of CFTC-regulated Solana futures in the U.S. signals growing institutional interest, potentially driving liquidity and price action in the coming months. At the same time, Solana’s blockchain continues to attract attention, with Sol Strategies hitting new milestones and solidifying its role in decentralized finance. However, the Solana price has faced turbulence, reflecting broader market conditions and investor sentiment. Solana price currently sits around $172 after slipping by 12.70% over the past 7 days. Why TRX & SOL Holders Bet on $0.005 Panshibi to Dominate Soon Crypto moves fast, but Panshibi is moving even faster. TRX and SOL holders are watching closely as this meme-fueled rocket refuses to slow down. Unlike the usual pump-and-dump hype, SHIBI is proving it has real staying power, blending meme culture with actual investor incentives. Right now, the presale is in Stage 4 and the numbers speak for themselves. The token price has soared 150% to $0.005 and investors have already thrown in over $1.1 million. With the Tron price and Solana price constantly shifting, some traders are looking at SHIBI as the next big play that might not just ride the wave but create its own. Industry experts are tipping Panshibi to be the biggest Asian-inspired meme coin, with many predicting it could dominate the sector in 2025. With a 1,200% price increase locked in for the presale and projections of a 145,000% surge post-launch, the numbers suggest exactly what a crypto revolution looks like. With Tron news making waves and Solana price fluctuations keeping traders alert, SHIBI is steadily gaining traction. As momentum builds, it’s positioning itself as a serious contender in the meme coin space, drawing attention from investors looking for the next major breakout. Panshibi Presale Awaits, But Not Forever! Panshibi’s presale is moving fast and those paying attention know exactly why. The buzz around SHIBI is growing louder, with its price primed for an explosive run. While tron news highlights shifting market trends and Solana price action keeps traders guessing, one thing is clear – this meme coin isn’t here to play. It’s here to dominate.

American businessman Mike Novogratz highlighted in a podcast that XRP owes its resilience to its community, which helped the crypto sustain its value over the years. Related Reading: Solana Faces Double Trouble: 55% Network Drop And Price Woes Resilience Of XRP Novogratz was previously skeptical of the lasting power of XRP but in recent years, the American entrepreneur backtracked from his initial skepticism on crypto. The billionaire investor could be the latest addition to those who have changed their opinion on XRP after seeing the crypto remain strong. In a Galaxy Brains podcast, Novogratz acknowledged the resilience of XRP, recognizing the crucial role played by its community to keep the value of the crypt asset. The American businessman explained that XRP began when the crypto ecosystem had not witnessed an oversupply of altcoins, adding that this condition allowed the crypto to build an actual community. He added that the crypto community that XRP successfully built is the primary reason why the digital asset was able to sustain its relevance. Decline Of Ethereum Novogratz mentioned the resiliency of XRP after being asked about the declining performance of Ethereum against Bitcoin. During the podcast, Novogratz was asked for his opinion on when the ETH-to-BTC ratio would be reversed, noting that Ethereum has already dropped significantly against Bitcoin since the merge. The American entrepreneur explained that compared to BTC, Ethereum is a more complex proposition as a global decentralized trust layer, adding that ETH has encountered challenges because of the increase in competition and an oversupply of altcoins in the market. “One of the reasons I think the prices of all these alts are going down is, there are too many of them. There is an infinite amount of token supply coming up and there is not enough time for those narratives to build community,” Novogratz pointed out. Community Engagement Crucial Novogratz was skeptical of the lasting power of XRP but later conceded his belief, saying that he underestimated the XRP Army and the proponents of the XRP community. The billionaire entrepreneur said that XRP has remained relevant due to the crypto’s passionate user base, who have actively defended and promoted the digital asset over the years. He noted that one of the essential aspects of cryptocurrency valuations is community engagement, which has played a big role in the asset valuations of XRP and Bitcoin.

At the same time, Warren is sitting on an all-time high of $334 billion in cash, even as US interest rates are expected to drop. His 2024 annual letter, released on Saturday, was supposed to answer the biggest question on investors’ minds: Why is Berkshire offloading stocks at record speed? But instead of an explanation, Warren doubled down on his love for equities, writing, “Despite what some commentators currently view as an extraordinary cash position at Berkshire, the great majority of your money remains in equities. That preference won’t change.” His actions, however, tell a different story, and this is the longest continuous selling streak in Berkshire’s history. In total, Berkshire sold $143 billion worth of stocks throughout 2024, while buying just $9.2 billion, making it one of his most aggressive divestment years. This sell-off was led by reductions in Apple and Bank of America, two of Berkshire’s largest stock positions. Warren Buffett breaks an investment pattern The fourth quarter of 2024 was the first time in over a decade that Berkshire bought back zero shares, and Warren confirmed that the company had not repurchased any stock in early 2025 either. This was despite Berkshire posting a record 27% rise in operating earnings. “Berkshire shareholders can rest assured that we will forever deploy a substantial majority of their money in equities – mostly American equities although many of these will have international operations of significance. Berkshire will never prefer ownership of cash-equivalent assets over the ownership of good businesses, whether controlled or only partially owned,” Warren wrote in his letter to the shareholders. But after selling more stocks than he has in years, piling up a cash hoard bigger than the GDP of most countries, and refusing to buy even his own company’s shares, many aren’t convinced. His 2024 sell-off comes in the middle of one of the strongest stock market rallies in years. The S&P 500 surged over 20% for two consecutive years, and stocks remain near all-time highs. Yet, Warren—who has consistently outperformed the stock market for years now—isn’t buying. He’s selling. A strategy for Greg Abel? Or a warning sign? At Berkshire’s 2023 annual meeting, Warren shocked investors by announcing that Greg Abel, his long-time vice chairman, would take over all investment decisions, including control over Berkshire’s $368 billion stock portfolio. Some analysts believe the cash piling is about Warren preparing Berkshire for Abel’s leadership. By liquidating stocks, Warren may be giving Abel a clean slate, making sure his successor has the flexibility to make big decisions without being tied to Warren’s legacy investments. Warren himself hinted at Abel’s influence in his latest letter, saying, “Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities. Greg has vividly shown his ability to act at such times as did Charlie.” That comparison to Charlie Munger, Warren’s late right-hand man, was another big sign of his endorsement of Abel’s decision-making skills. Despite his massive stock sell-offs, Warren is still active in one area: Japan. Berkshire has been steadily increasing its stakes in five Japanese trading houses, a position Warren started nearly six years ago. Unlike his American holdings, Warren made it clear that he plans to keep expanding in Japan, writing in his letter that: “Over time, you will likely see Berkshire’s ownership of all five increase somewhat.” Berkshire is now the biggest taxpayer in the US Warren had plenty to say about taxes. In 2024, Berkshire reportedly paid $26.8 billion in corporate income taxes, making it the biggest taxpayer in the United States. That sum accounted for 5% of all corporate tax revenue collected by the US government. In his letter, Warren took the opportunity to warn Washington about reckless spending, writing, “Spend it wisely. Take care of the many who, for no fault of their own, get the short straws in life. They deserve better. And never forget that we need you to maintain a stable currency and that result requires both wisdom and vigilance on your part.” He also reminded lawmakers that the value of the US dollar isn’t invincible, adding, “Paper money can see its value evaporate if fiscal folly prevails. In some countries, this reckless practice has become habitual, and in our country’s short history, the US has come close to the edge.” This isn’t the first time Warren has warned about inflation and reckless government spending, but with Berkshire now sitting on its largest-ever cash reserve, his words carry even more weight. Warren’s 2024 shareholder letter ended on an unusual note. Instead of discussing future plans, he made a rare joke about his own lack of skills outside investing. “Lacking such assets as athletic excellence, a wonderful voice, medical or legal skills or, for that matter, any special talents, I have had to rely on equities throughout my life,” Warren Buffett wrote.

But props to the company for finally starting to repay creditors. It went through with its first round of repayments on February 18, where it paid out the ‘Convenience Class,’ i.e., investors who lost up to $50K. The next FTX repayment distribution will happen on May 30. In addition to the company’s trading partners and vendors, this round will address investors who had assets on the exchange when it went under. It’s worth noting, however, that in order to qualify for this round of distribution, FTX creditors must verify their claims by April 11. FTX Faces Claims from Ineligible Jurisdictions Amid the bankruptcy-repayment saga, FTX creditor and advocate Sunil Kavuri took to X to share a list of 163 countries that are allegedly ineligible for repayment. The list includes countries like China, Russia, Nigeria, Egypt, and Ukraine. Neither Sunil nor FTX has given any reasons for the rejection of claims in these regions. However, Sunil did say that FTX is reviewing its options. The bottom line, therefore, is that FTX repaying its creditors could be very good news for crypto overall. As the date of the next FTX repayment inches closer, here are some of the best meme coins most likely to rally. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Meme Coin for First-Time Investors Although the larger crypto market, including meme coins, benefits from Bitcoin’s growth, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is here to take this correlation to a whole new level. It’s a fresh take on meme coin dynamics, seeing as it won’t just rally because of market hype and community backing but also from increasing crypto adoption and subsequently rising Bitcoin prices. $BTCBULL token holders will receive free $BTC every time Bitcoin hits a new benchmark number, such as $150K, $200K, $250K, and beyond. While other meme coins offer tokens or amusing NFT characters as rewards, BTC Bull Token has become the only crypto project to reward token holders with $BTC, a very valuable asset. Additionally, with 40% of the token supply set to be used for marketing purposes, we can expect $BTCBULL to continue its upward trajectory long after it gets listed on an exchange. The $BTCBULL presale came out all guns blazing and has raised more than $2.6M in less than two weeks. You can join the BTC Bull Army by paying just $0.002375 per token. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana Meme Coin Breathing New Life Into the Network Solana’s recent performance has been suboptimal, to say the least. Especially when it’s one of the top players in the blockchain game and a haven for meme coins. The network is plagued with issues: network congestion, failed transactions, and limited scalability. Enter Solaxy ($SOLX) . A multi-chain token, Solaxy will process transactions off-chain and in batches. This will not only reduce the overall pressure Solana’s mainnet has been facing of late but also reduce transaction costs. With Solana ($SOL) right on the edge of dropping to $125 due to increasing downward pressure, Solaxy ($SOLX) offers a ray of light and what could possibly be the turning point for the network. Poised to be the biggest catalyst behind Solana’s growth, it’s no wonder why $SOLX is one of the top contenders for the next 100x crypto . Luckily for you, the project is currently in presale ($23M+ raised), meaning you can become an investor at some of the lowest prices ever. 1 $SOLX is currently available for just $0.001644. Moreover, early adopters will also be able to benefit from the project’s 176% staking rewards. Here’s how to buy $SOLX . 3. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – AI Agent Offering Crypto Investment Advice If you missed out on the recent $BROCCOLI explosion, chances are you weren’t looking at CZ’s X chatter. We don’t blame you, though. After all, it’s simply impossible to be aware of everything crypto-related going on online. Unless, of course, you’re MIND of Pepe ($MIND) . As the best AI agent coin , $MIND is set to revolutionize how crypto investing works. Gone are the days when you had to be on your toes scouting for investment opportunities. $MIND will do it for you. $MIND will interact with the online crypto community (on dApps and social media platforms like X) and cut through all the varying opinions and insights and mountains of information to identify the next cryptos to explode . The $MIND presale is underway, and you can become an early investor for just $0.0033857 per token. With over $6.7M in presale funding so far, $MIND sits comfortably among the best crypto presales live right now. Here’s how to buy it . 4. Comedian ($BAN) – Trending Community-Driven Meme Coin There’s never a dull day in crypto, and Comedian is the most recent example of this. It’s a relatively new meme coin based on the infamous artwork of Maurizio Cattelan featuring a banana taped to a wall. The artwork, in case you haven’t been up to speed, instantly went viral, sparking debates on whether modern art is really as thought-provoking as it claims to be. Or is it just lazy, overhyped, and borderline insulting to the greats of the past. Launched on the Pump.Fun platform in October 2024, the $BAN token was an immediate success. It rose to $0.3 just days after its launch, generating over 460% gains for early investors. After consolidating for nearly two months, the token is back to dominating the market. It has jumped nearly 100% in the last seven days. The momentum seems to continue as we head into the second week of a fresh Comedian ($BAN) rally. It’s currently trading at $0.1408 . Conclusion Even though times ahead look like they’ll be very kind to crypto and meme coins, it’s always a wise idea to follow healthy investing habits. These include only putting in a small amount and preparing yourself for violent ups and downs. Also, this article shouldn’t be considered financial advice.

Miners face low margins, high competition, and cyclical industry dynamics, often resulting in negative net incomes and the need for continuous capital infusion. Key differentiators among miners include operational efficiency, HODL strategies, and potential pivots to HPC/AI datacenters, though industry dynamics often overshadow these factors. Investors should be cautious, as miners typically lose money over time, even during BTC bull cycles, due to the industry's poor economics and high operational costs. “When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for poor fundamental economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact.” –Warren Buffett The BTC mining industry In my opinion, BTC (BTC-USD) mining is a C+ business and investors should recognize the importance of industry dynamics when investing. BTC miners are often thought of as levered plays on BTC, where, like the tide, the price of BTC lifts or lowers all boats. However, most BTC miners have underperformed BTC in the last year despite several positive catalysts, most important being the increase in the price of BTC. Investors should be cautious and recognize the cyclical nature of the industry is just as important (if not more so) than the qualities of individual companies. And even companies with positive underlying fundamentals usually lose money due to the poor economics of the industry. BTC mining is a straight-forward business where profit is determined by the difference between Bitcoin’s spot price and power and computing costs. For example, if the spot price of BTC is $100,000 and power are computing costs are $70,000, a BTC miner will make $30,000 per BTC. It’s a simple business, but it is not easy. BTC mining is very competitive with low barriers to entry, and despite having low energy costs, miners typically have low margins. For example, none of them made any money last year! Gross margins were positive, but net incomes were negative after including depreciation expense for computers. Because P/E ratios are undefined, EBITDA and CFO multiples are two financial metrics most commonly used for comparison and valuation. EBITDA adds back depreciation expense, which some argue is overstated due to a longer useful life of the computers. However, not replacing miners will eventually result in higher energy costs, so either way, computer costs impact earnings. Cash flow from operations ((CFO)) were also negative– except for a handful of miners. Despite negative CFOs, many miners recycle cash flows into new machines and additional mining capacity to remain competitive. Thus, most miners are running to stand still financially, and investors should question the logic of additional investment. In this article, I use three attributes to differentiate between BTC miners: 1) operational efficiency; 2) whether the miner keeps the BTC it mines or sells it (i.e. a HODL strategy); and 3) whether the miner plans to pivot towards HPC/AI datacenters. Each of these differentiators had positive catalysts last year that caused individual BTC miners to perform well in the short term. However, on the whole BTC miners have underperformed during a bull cycle for BTC. If miners cannot make money during the best of times, it’s certain that they will lose money in the worst of times. A final criticism investors should be aware of is that most miners use stock offerings and convertible bonds to pursue growth at all cost, diluting existing shareholders. So, although the company might have an advantage in the differentiators above (i.e. better profitability, an increase in HODL value, and a pivot to HPC), the equity value of the company will decline because the company continually requires an infusion of new equity to maintain its market position. In conclusion, the economics of BTC mining sort of stinks, and investors should be cautious of the cyclical nature of the industry before investing. Current BTC Bull cycle and positive and negative catalysts: Last year, BTC miners benefitted from multiple positive catalysts that ushered in a new bull cycle. Most important for the bull cycle was an increase in price of BTC. The price of BTC is a positive catalyst for BTC miners for two reasons. First is that it improves margins for the mining business, and second, the price of BTC increases the value of the HODL if the miner holds BTC. As shown in the chart below, the current BTC cycle appears to be progressing similar to previous cycles. Medium.com Source: Where are we in the bitcoin cycle? A second positive catalyst for BTC and miners last year was Trump’s election in November. It is widely expected that Trump’s administration will be positive for the BTC industry with favorable regulations, favorable energy policy, and the potential for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve ((SBR)). A third catalyst for BTC has been investor demand for BTC ETFs and corporate adoption of BTC as a treasury asset. Most prominent in this area is Michael Saylor and Strategy ( MSTR ) purchasing BTC using convertible debt. A final positive catalyst for BTC miners is the creation of a BTC miner ETF by Grayscale. The Grayscale Bitcoin Miners ETF ( MNRS ) will likely increase investment and interest in the industry. To promote their ETF, Grayscale wrote this summary of the industry . Despite the positive catalysts, most BTC miners have underperformed BTC over the last year. For example, the chart below shows miners' performance through the year when compared to BTC. 1 year returns of BTC and 12 miners (Author calculations) Roughly half the BTC miners posted gains over the last year. However, only Core Scientific, Bitdeer, Hut8, and TeraWulf gained more than BTC, with Iris Energy, and Cipher posting returns similar to BTC. 1 year returns for each BTC miners (Author calculations) Lastly, the chart below shows the hypothetical return of $100 invested in BTC when compared to an index of 12 BTC miners. Although BTC was up about 83% over the past year, the BTC miner index was only up about 50%. Comparison of BTC performance and hypothetical BTC Miner index (Author estimates) It can be argued that the returns above are somewhat arbitrary due to the selection of the 1-year, historical time window (i.e. February 2024 - 2025). However, most miners lost money when looking at their financials over the past year. In general, miners briefly made money in Q1 as the increase in BTC price improved margins. However, the BTC halving in the second quarter was a negative catalyst that decreased revenues and returned miners to negative net incomes. As a result, twelve trailing month earnings appear positive for some miners (MARA, RIOT, and HUT), but I doubt that miners will report positive earnings in 2025 unless BTC continues to rise, further increasing margins. The impact of the halving can also be seen in EBITDA and CFO in Q3, which are negative for all but three miners (CORZ, WULF and BITF). Financials for BTC miners (S&P Capital IQ and Author) A second negative catalyst has been an increase in global hash rates, which have increased 50% from about 550 TH/s to 850 TH/s over the last year. Thus, miners that have not increased their production in proportion to the increase in global has rate will mine less BTC per day. Consequently, miners only make money during these short time windows where the BTC price increases, before global hash rates respond to erode (if not eliminate) temporary profits. It will be interesting to watch revenues and income for Q4 2024 and the price of BTC going forward. Global Hash Rate of BTC network (Blockchain.com) A framework for comparing miners The three attributes I use to differentiate miners are: operational efficiency, the miners’ HODL strategy, and whether it plans to pivot to more stable revenues of HPC. Despite these attributes as a way to evaluate miners, the industry dynamics are likely still more important. As the Warren Buffett quote suggests, an A+ operator in a C+ industry will likely lose. Operational Efficiency For operational efficiency, power cost and computer efficiency are the two most important metrics. However, it is really difficult to rank miners by operational efficiency because there are a variety of metrics, which often indicate contradictory performance among miners. Also, I think there is little differentiation in operational performance because power costs and miner efficiency are somewhat uniform. For power costs, miners have established operations around the world near the cheapest sources of power. Often these are stranded, excess energy resources, such as hydropower, nuclear power, natural gas flared from a fracking, or intermittent wind and solar. A miner might get a good deal of 3-4 cents/kWh for electricity, but there is a natural, lower limit for power costs because power producers have to cover their own capital costs of energy production. Good miners have fixed price power agreements behind the meter, where a bad miner will have variable, ‘front of the meter’ power costs. Second, there is little differentiation for computer efficiency because miners all buy the same computers from the same computer three companies (Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT). Although machines might become older and less efficient, most miners upgrade their machines after 2–3 years, and sell the older machines. So a single miner never has a significant advantage for computer efficiency for a substantial period of time. In some ways, miners are like Formula 1 race car teams - they all have the same car design, engine, tires, etc. One team might have a slight advantage for a short period, but the other miners will recognize their advantage and upgrade their machines to eliminate the advantage. Below are three metrics I follow to compare miner’s operational efficiency: BTC miner per exahash; energy efficiency (J/TH) of mining operations; and quarterly mining costs per BTC mined. The table is ranked by market cap, which tends to coincide with the exahash of mining capacity, and thus, the amount of BTC mined per month. Collectively this group of publically traded companies is about $30 billion of market cap, and represents about 31% of the BTC mined on any given day, or roughly 3,900 BTC in December. BTC mined per EH/s and energy efficiency in J/TH are the two best metrics for efficiency. BTC mined per EH/s measures how productive the miner fleet is with each exahash of capacity. Larger numbers are better for this metric, and the best miners report about 18-19 BTC mined per EH. The second is energy efficiency, which measures the amount of energy per unit of computing power. Smaller numbers are better for this metric, with the most efficient miners under 20 J/TH. The final metric is quarterly mining costs for electricity per BTC mined. This metric shows the electrical cost of each BTC mined. Lower cost for each BTC means a miner will have higher gross margins, and likely higher net incomes. Similarly, the final column shows reported energy costs per MWh. The best miners tend to have contracted power between $30-40 MWh (or $0.03-0.04 per kWh). As part of their power agreements, most miners have curtailment obligations, which require miners to decrease their power consumption when demand and power rates increase. As a secondary data point to my numbers below, Anthony Power wrote a great article recently that reconciles capacity, efficiency and power costs across miners. Operational Efficiency metrics (Author from company filings) HODL The second differentiator between BTC miners is whether it keeps the BTC it mines, dubbed a HODL strategy (or hang on for dear life). Due to the price volatility of BTC, some miners historically sold all the BTC it mined to fund operations and report more consistent earnings. Executives of the no HODL strategy are no doubt BTC advocates, but argue that the business of mining and speculation on BTC are two distinct concepts. As they say, ‘If you believe in BTC, buy BTC. But our business is mining, not speculating on the price of BTC.’ Other miners historically sold the bare minimum to fund operations and HODLed the BTC they mined. As a result, historical revenues were lower, but now many of these miners have substantial BTC reserves on the balance sheet. These reserves add leverage, where the market price of BTC adds to or subtracts from the value of the company. Given there will only be 21 million BTC, and that likely 20 million remain due to loss of keys, these HODLs that were established at much lower BTC prices and could potentially exceed the value of the mining operations. As shown in the far-right column, in some cases the mining operations only represent 50% of the value of the company, with the other 50% of the value due to the HODL. To put the HODLs below into context, collectively the group owns about 90,000 BTC. BlackRock BTC ETF owns about 580,000 BTC and Strategy owns about 400,000 BTC, or about 3% and 2% respectively (or 5% in total) of all BTC that will exist. So, the miners are roughly one-quarter the size of the Strategy or BlackRock ETFs, with half of the industry’s HODL owned by Marathon. If the US or some other nation pursues a BTC Reserve and attempts to acquire 500,000 BTC (similar in size to IBIT or MSTR), it will be very difficult to source enough BTC for the reserve without the price of BTC going much higher. In short, miners cannot supply enough BTC from their future mining operations. As mentioned, the miners collectively mine only 3,800 BTC per month. So a BTC reserve of 400,000 BTC would take 100 months to mine, or 9 years of all miners’ production! In my opinion, many BTC miners with HODLs do not currently reflect this upside potential from the price of BTC. As a sub-set of the HODL strategy, some miners also issue convertible debt to purchase BTC in addition to the BTC they mine, implementing a strategy similar to Strategy. HODL Strategy metrics (Author from company filings) HPC Pivot The last differentiator between BTC miners is whether the miner is expanding into high-performance computing (HPC) to leverage their expertise building data centers and power agreements to increase revenues. The advantage of the HPC strategy is that HPC revenues will be more stable, have better margins, and allow for added leverage. Core Scientific set off this trend last summer when it announced a deal to host HPC operations for Core Weave, an AI/ML software developer. The deal has sort of set a high-water mark where Core Scientific will receive $1.5m for each MW of power with 80% margins on the capital invested. TeraWulf was the second company to announce a deal in December 2024. Other miners had hosting operations already (BTDR), or recently acquired data centers ( BTBT ) to enter the HPC space. Riot platforms initially stated they would not host the HPC market, but announced in January that they would pivot to HPC and decrease its energy target for its BTC mining operations. Some people speculate this indicates Riot is close to announcing a deal for its energy assets. Miners that do not intend to pivot to HPC argue that miners lack the financial firepower to compete with tech companies and hyper scalers. For example, the combined market cap of all the miners is $30 billion. Microsoft alone plans to spend $80 billion in capital expenditures in 2025 for AI, or roughly 2.5 times the market cap of the entire miner industry. The Wall Street Journal wrote an article recently that summarized $75 billion in quarterly capex at the tech giants. Also, it is unclear if miners have a unique competitive advantage for hosting compared to other data center operators. Indeed, they have experience building BTC mining facilities, but ultimately most miners plan to offer building shells with power and an internet connection with the customer providing the computers. How exactly is this different than a data center REIT, like Digital Realty Trust (DLR)? (More specified build outs and hosting arrangements are more complex, require server GPU computers, and carry more risk due to computer obsolescence.) HPC Pivot metrics (Author from company filings) Conclusion I hope with this article provided some insight into the industry and provides a warning about some mistakes I’ve made. I first invested in HIVE Digital ( HIVE ) during the BTC bull cycle that began in 2016-2017. It is a small position that I continue to hold. Over this time frame, BTC has increased 50x, rising from $2,000 to $100,000. However, my stock is down 75%! Hive stock performance since 2017 (Yahoo Finance) How is that possible? In theory, the company makes on each BTC that it mines and owns a HODL of BTC. I thought BTC miners were a levered play on the price of BTC? What did I miss? And how can I prevent this from occurring again? I believe the answer is that I failed to understand the basic economics of the industry: that the all in costs to mine a BTC exceed the cost of BTC. I incorrectly assumed that BTC mining would be similar to oil refining and gold mining. In oil refining, profitability is determined by the crack spread, or the difference between oil costs and revenues from refined products, like gasoline. Except for rare time periods like March 2020 when oil prices went negative, refiners are almost guaranteed to make a small profit margin from refining. So, refiners make a small profit over a continual volume of throughput. For gold miners, profitability is usually determined by the all in sustaining costs (AISC) of the mine. Gold miners cannot control the price of gold, and mining is highly capital intensive. So gold miners ensure there is a sufficient buffer between the price of gold and their AISC. Therefore, miners can cut production to maintain profitability if the price of gold declines. So, gold miners make profit based on an estimated volume of production. BTC miners are somewhat a combination of both refiners and gold miners. Net margins are very thin (or negative) similar to refiners. But unlike gold miners, BTC miners cannot control their AISC because of the growth in global hash rate erodes the value of the mine. It’s like a gold mine, where the amount of gold in the ground has a half life and dissipates with time. Miners also believe they grow their way to profitability by improving efficiency and economies of scale. The logic is, “gross margins are good, and we’ll eventually make money if we grow to spread the computational costs out across a wider base of operations.” Growth in global hash rates also requires them to pursue growth, so it seems to make sense. As a result, miners sell each BTC at a loss while trying to make up the loss on volume. This strategy consumes capital from investors who mistakenly believe that miners are a levered play on the price of BTC, and that miners will continue to make money when only at the periods when the economics of mining make sense. BTC miners could perform well if this BTC bull cycle continues. As described above, it really depends on how high the price of BTC goes and whether new investors, that don’t understand the industry, bid up the stocks. But, if or when the cycle ends, miners will likely lose money as the economics of the industry don’t make sense. Time will tell. At the very least, I got a laugh recently when I read that Hive was expanding production … by buying a site from Bitfarms ( BITF ), another BTC miner!

The attack occurred during a routine transfer between wallets, with hackers successfully diverting the funds to an unidentified address. Bybit assured customers their remaining assets were secure but warned of potential withdrawal delays due to the incident. CEO Ben Zhou emphasized that the company could absorb the loss and remain solvent, even if the stolen funds were not recovered. Recent reports suggest that The Lazarus Group, a cybercriminal organization linked to North Korea, is responsible for the hack. Analysts identified substantial overlaps between the hackers’ addresses and those used in previous North Korean cyberattacks. North Korea has a history of targeting cryptocurrency platforms , stealing approximately billions of tokens over the past few years. The U.S. government and international security agencies have warned that such activities help fund North Korea’s missile and weapons programs, increasing geopolitical tensions. Bitcoin Enthusiasts Call for Ethereum’s Intervention In response to the hack, Bitcoin enthusiasts Justin Bechler and Matthew Kratter raised concerns about Ethereum’s role in addressing the situation. Kratter argued that if Ethereum’s leadership does not push through a hard fork to revoke access to the stolen funds, they could be viewed as complicit in “aiding and abetting global terrorism.” Bechler further noted that Ethereum is in a no-win situation: either roll back the chain and prove its centralization or do nothing and risk regulatory consequences for allowing stolen funds to circulate. Vitalik is caught in a nightmare he can't win. Roll back the chain and Ethereum proves it’s centralized. Do nothing and Ethereum funds North Korean terrorism and will suffer brutal OFAC sanctions. Either way, Ethereum is finished. The only question is how fast it collapses. https://t.co/dVI3UZZJfi — Justin Bechler (@1914ad) February 22, 2025 We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Unlike Bitcoin, which operates on a fixed monetary policy and a strict commitment to immutability, Ethereum has historically implemented network changes through hard forks, such as the response to the 2016 DAO hack, which resulted in the creation of Ethereum Classic by those who disagreed. Will the Government Step In? If Ethereum initiates a hard fork to reverse the hack, it would demonstrate a willingness to alter transaction history, raising concerns about its decentralization. Such an action could set a precedent where Ethereum is expected to intervene in major security incidents, potentially undermining its credibility as a neutral and censorship-resistant platform. On the other hand, inaction carries its risks. With North Korea implicated, regulators such as the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) could take enforcement actions, similar to its 2022 sanctions on the cryptocurrency mixing service Tornado Cash. The U.S. government has previously targeted services linked to laundering stolen cryptocurrency, and Ethereum’s response to the Bybit hack may influence future policies regarding blockchain networks.

Market participants are closely watching price movements, with many expecting DOGE to surpass its all-time high of $0.739. As the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reviews multiple applications for a Dogecoin ETF, traders and investors are anticipating a major rally. Dogecoin ETF Filings and Market Expectations Grayscale Investments, CoinShares, and WisdomTree have submitted applications for a Dogecoin ETF, aiming to provide investors with regulated exposure to the cryptocurrency. The SEC has acknowledged Grayscale’s filing, signaling the beginning of a formal review process. If approved, the ETF could attract institutional investors, potentially driving up Dogecoin price. Regulatory sentiment toward cryptocurrencies appears to be shifting, especially under the current administration. Recently, the SEC dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase , reflecting a more crypto-friendly stance. This change has fueled optimism regarding the approval of new crypto investment products, including altcoin ETFs like XRP, Litecoin, Hedera and a Dogecoin ETF. Consequently, analysts suggest that if an ETF receives approval, Dogecoin price could see a substantial increase. Technical Indicators Suggest a Bullish Outlook Chart analysis indicates that Dogecoin price may be preparing for a breakout. A falling wedge pattern has formed on the four-hour chart, and DOGE has broken out of this formation. This pattern is typically seen as a bullish signal, suggesting further price gains. Key indicators also point toward potential upside movement. The Average Directional Index (ADX) stands at 27.95, indicating that a trend is forming. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has risen to 43.67, recovering from oversold conditions. If RSI crosses above 50, it could confirm bullish momentum for Dogecoin price. DOGE/USD 4hr price chart (TradingView) Traders are watching key support and resistance levels. The support level is around $0.23, while resistance sits at $0.26 and $0.30. A move above these levels could signal further gains for Dogecoin price. Analysts Predict DOGE Price Could Reach $3 to $5 Several analysts like Javon Marks are forecasting major price increases for Dogecoin in the current market cycle. Concurrently, Basic Trading has identified $0.2, $0.5, and $5 as key price levels, noting that Dogecoin price is in an upward trend despite recent corrections. The analyst pointed out that DOGE has followed a historical pattern of large percentage gains in previous bull cycles. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has also projected a bullish scenario for Dogecoin price. He highlighted that if the support range between $0.16 and $0.19 holds, DOGE could rally to $3 . Similarly, analyst Trader Tardigrade stated that Dogecoin’s macro chart is showing a similar pattern to the 2017 cycle, which could result in a surge toward $1.7. Other analysts have set even higher price targets. Dima Potts suggested that Dogecoin price could reach $10 if it mirrors past bull market trends. Some traders believe that DOGE’s historical price movements indicate a strong possibility of surpassing previous all-time highs.

Beiko went to X to explain why reverting the chain to its pre-hack state wasn’t an option. He wrote: “It’s worth breaking down why this reasonably sounding proposal is technically intractable for less knowledgeable observers.” Experts push for Ethereum rollback to recover Bybit’s stolen funds The hack on Bybit happened on Feb. 21, following the transfer of funds from the exchange’s multisig wallet to a warm wallet. The transaction did look legitimate, but malicious code had infected the smart contract logic, allowing hackers—thought to be the North Korean Lazarus Group—to drain funds away. Some industry experts have proposed rolling back Ethereum, with BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes and Jan3 CEO Samson Mow both publicly backing the idea of rolling the token back to recover the stolen funds and prevent the North Korean government from spending them. But a rollback like that, Beiko explains, is nothing like Ethereum’s controversial hard fork in 2016 after the TheDAO hack. Hackers took advantage of a vulnerability in TheDAO incident to drain about 15% of all ETH at the time. There was a failsafe whereby withdrawals were delayed for a month, giving developers a chance to intervene. In the end, the community voted in favor of an “irregular state change,” reversing the hack and resulting in the split between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. Beiko elaborated, saying that the same delay did not exist in the Bybit hack. The funds were immediately available and rapidly distributed on-chain, rendering intervention impossible without wider disruption. Ethereum rollback sparks warnings of catastrophic consequences A rollback would be far more disruptive now due to the exponential growth of Ethereum’s infrastructure since 2016, Beiko emphasized, than it was when TheDAO hack happened. The emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, cross-chain bridges, and real-world asset integrations means that any nonstandard state change could trigger failure at a massive scale. Beiko warned that t his level of interconnectedness means that any irregular state change, even if socially palatable, would have near-intractable ripple effects . He continued to say that a rollback would also invalidate many legitimate transactions, affecting thousands of users unrelated to the hack. Anthony Sassano, Ethereum educator, shared a similar sentiment: “That’s not how any of this works, and not even how it worked with TheDAO hack.” Yuga Labs Blockchain VP—using the X handle 0xQuit —also criticized rollback proponents, stating that the economic dislocation caused by that action would be orders of magnitude greater than the $1.5 billion taken. “Thousands of innocent people would get money taken from them, thousands more would receive money they shouldn’t,” 0xQuit wrote. According to the VP, Ethereum has become the foundation of DeFi and the default settlement layer for many rollups, making a rollback impossible. Even Bybit CEO Ben Zhou seemed to waffle on the concept, noting that he was not sure if it was one man’s decision. He suggested that following the blockchain ethos, the decision should perhaps go to a vote to gauge community opinion, but he admitted uncertainty. Blockchain rollbacks were plausible only in Bitcoin’s early days or during the infamous TheDAO incident, but the present level of complexity in Ethereum makes them all but impossible, Beiko concluded. As a decentralized network, Ethereum makes transaction immutability a big deal—once confirmed, it cannot be undone, and reversing it would shake up the rest of the crypto system. As Ethereum developers refuse to revert to the earlier state, the crypto industry will need to look to other means of healing, such as fortifying security measures and facilitating user awareness that will prevent future exploits of this magnitude.

In his latest post , he emphasized that the asset is still filling in an ascending triangle pattern that historically favors breakouts to the upside. #XRP – 12 Hours TF UPDATE: Nothing has changed still filling in the Ascending Triangle. Historical data suggests that ascending triangles breaking out is as follows: 1⃣ To the upside approximately 70-75% of the time. 2⃣ To the downside occur around 25-30% of the time.… pic.twitter.com/E0FXevYE9d — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) February 22, 2025 Key Insights from Egrag Crypto’s Analysis The analyst pointed out that historical data indicates ascending triangles tend to break out in an upward direction approximately 70-75% of the time, while downward breakouts occur only 25-30% of the time. Based on this statistical pattern, Egrag Crypto expects XRP to revisit the $3.2 to $3.4 range. The accompanying chart highlights key price levels, showing current support at $2.4700 and resistance levels at $2.7500, $3.2240, and $3.4000. On the downside, potential targets include $2.0000 and $1.6000. Additionally, the chart outlines previous highs and price movements that align with the overall ascending triangle structure. The “Face Melting Phase” label suggests a significant price movement may be imminent once the resistance is breached. Community Reactions and Technical Perspectives The post sparked discussions among XRP enthusiasts, with several users sharing their views on the technical outlook. One user, BuyTheDip, expressed skepticism about the predictability of price movements, stating : “I think it has a mind of its own! I do believe that TA has some credibility, especially with key resistance lines and so on, but in regards to the direction it goes, the market decides and does what it wants!” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This comment reflects the broader sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, where technical analysis is useful but not an absolute predictor of price movements. External factors such as market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, and regulatory developments also play a role in determining price trends. Another user supported Egrag Crypto’s technical analysis, pointing out “The five-wave triangle ended at $2.50 and needs to break the top of the ascending triangle to move towards the pattern’s target, the $3.3 level.” This perspective aligns with Elliott Wave Theory, which suggests that market movements often follow recognizable wave structures. If XRP breaks the upper boundary of the triangle, it could confirm the bullish outlook suggested by Egrag Crypto. For traders and investors, the key levels to watch include the $2.4700 support level and the $2.7500 resistance. A confirmed breakout above resistance could lead to a push towards $3.2 and beyond, while a failure to break resistance may result in a retest of lower support zones.

Pseudonymous analyst Credible Crypto tells his 462,900 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks Bitcoin is trading in a wide range between $110,000 and $88,000. While the analyst believes that Bitcoin’s consolidation will eventually resolve to the upside, he predicts that BTC will first drop to the low $80,000 price range to shake out paper-handed traders before kicking off a parabolic surge. “On the higher time frame for BTC, it would be nice to have this multi-month consolidation complete with a clean base as pictured before the next impulse begins. Focus right now is on two ranges – one low time frame (blue) and one high time frame (black). We may or may not visit the highs of the low time frame range first (blue arrow) but ideally would love to see a deviation below the higher time frame range lows before a reversal, reclaim and impulsive move to the upside.” Source: Credible/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that after the correction, Bitcoin will soar to a new all-time of $126,000 by April of this year. The chart also appears to suggest that his short-term bearish outlook for Bitcoin will be invalidated if BTC convincingly takes out its resistance at $110,000. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $96,616, a fractional increase on the day.

The AI-powered prediction suggests that SHIB will climb approximately 5% from its current price of $0.00001570 to reach $0.0000165 by March 1, 2025. “Based on current market trends and SHIB’s historical performance, the token has the potential to gain 5% over the next few days, reaching approximately $0.0000165 by the start of March,” ChatGPT stated. SHIB’s current price of $0.00001570 reflects a 2.51% decline in the past 24 hours, but analysts and enthusiasts remain optimistic about its long-term trajectory. Shiba Inu’s Expanding Ecosystem Fuels Optimism A key factor supporting this bullish prediction is the steady growth of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. According to a recent report from Times Tabloid , SHIB has gained approximately 840,000 new addresses over the past year, bringing the total number of SHIB wallets to 4.64 million as of February 19, 2025. This surge in new addresses indicates increasing interest in SHIB, despite fluctuations in its price. Notably, the number of active wallets holding SHIB with a positive balance has grown from 1.29 million to 1.39 million in the past year. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additionally, the number of long-term holders—wallets holding SHIB for over a year—has increased from 1.03 million to 1.06 million, demonstrating investor confidence in the asset. These figures suggest that SHIB’s user base continues to expand, which could contribute to upward price momentum in the coming weeks. Shibarium’s Role in SHIB’s Growth Another factor that could support SHIB’s price rise is the increasing adoption of Shibarium , the project’s Layer-2 blockchain solution. Designed to improve scalability and reduce transaction fees, Shibarium has been gaining traction since its launch. The network has already processed millions of transactions, showing strong community engagement. As more users and developers adopt Shibarium for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, the demand for SHIB could increase, further boosting its price. Will SHIB Reach ChatGPT’s Target? While ChatGPT’s prediction of a 5% increase for SHIB is based on market trends and ecosystem growth, external factors such as broader crypto market movements, investor sentiment, and macroeconomic conditions could also influence the token’s price. If SHIB maintains its current trajectory, supported by rising adoption and an expanding user base, it could reach the predicted $0.0000165 mark by March 1, 2025.

Since taking control in January, Elon has axed hundreds of employees, stalled investigations, and wiped the agency’s name off its headquarters in Washington, D.C. Trump called it a win, saying his administration had “virtually shut down CFPB.” But behind closed doors, some of his top aides are reportedly worried Elon is moving too fast and could blow everything up in court. Russell Vought, who runs the Office of Management and Budget and is also acting CFPB director, has reportedly shared concerns about D.O.G.E’s lack of discipline. Him and other Trump allies fear Elon’s aggressive tactics could lead to lawsuits, and if a judge intervenes, the CFPB could survive. Notably, the Bloomberg report says a spokesperson for Vought denied any tensions exist, calling the reports “false and just another ax-to-grind story against D.O.G.E.” D.O.G.E slashes CFPB without a clear plan Elon’s team has been wiping out agencies across the federal government since Trump’s inauguration, with D.O.G.E workers firing thousands of employees, canceling contracts, and gutting programs they say don’t fit Trump’s agenda. The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025—a conservative blueprint for the government—called for Congress to eliminate the CFPB, but Elon has bypassed lawmakers completely. Now, D.O.G.E employees are operating out of the CFPB’s basement, tearing through agency contracts, asking staff which ones are required by law, and looking for anything they can cut. When they first arrived, CFPB employees were shocked—according to the report, it seemed like the D.O.G.E team had no idea what the agency even did. The confusion hasn’t slowed them down. Office leases are being reviewed, and oversight of major banks and fintech companies has come to a halt. Former CFPB Director Rohit Chopra slammed Elon’s actions, saying, “Defunding the police that watches over Wall Street and Big Tech will cost consumers billions. The only ones who benefit from shutting down the CFPB are companies that break the law.” Federal employees sue Trump in fear of retaliation As Elon’s D.O.G.E fires workers across Washington, some government employees are reportedly fighting back in court—but anonymously. A group of workers from USAID (U.S. Agency for International Development) persuaded a Maryland judge to let them sue the administration without revealing their names, saying they fear online harassment, losing their jobs, or worse. Federal courts almost never allow plaintiffs to remain anonymous, except in cases involving sexual assault, minors, or extreme retaliation risks. But now, a judge has approved anonymity for two employees suing the Office of Personnel Management, letting them go forward as “Jane Doe 1” and “Jane Doe 2.” The ruling, signed by Judge James Boasberg, says the plaintiffs provided “legitimate concerns about both physical and mental harm.” Boasberg also blocked the administration from firing any more workers until early March. The lawsuits against Trump’s executive orders have mostly come from labor unions, nonprofits, and advocacy groups, but now individual workers are stepping up. Many fear Elon’s online attacks, which target bureaucrats directly to his massive audience on X. One of his posts, where he called USAID a “criminal organization” that “needs to die,” got 33 million views. Elon’s digital payment ambitions and the fall of CFPB The fight over CFPB is also about digital payments. The CFPB oversees payment companies, and Elon has long criticized its interference in private business. Now, with his plans to turn X into a payments powerhouse, removing the CFPB gives him an open playing field. The CFPB was created under Barack Obama, and under Joe Biden, it took on major corporations like Walmart and Capital One. Now, it’s barely functioning. Former Director Vought’s stop-work order froze the agency’s biggest division—consumer financial oversight—shutting down investigations into credit cards, mortgages, and the housing market. There are also claims that Trump’s administration is trying to delete sensitive CFPB records. Bloomberg’s report claims a former chief technologist at the agency filed a legal complaint, saying officials were about to wipe a financial database with key regulatory information. A federal judge temporarily blocked the deletion, but no one knows how long the order will hold. Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of the CFPB’s original creators, is now pushing back. She scheduled a hearing for Tuesday to showcase what the agency has done for consumers, and personally invited Elon to attend. As of press time, he hadn’t RSVP’d.

However, traders are now bullish about a strong recovery in altcoin prices, following Bitcoin’s surge toward the $100K mark. In the upcoming week, we could see promising movements in the prices of Solana, Story, and Ethereum. ETHDenver Could Trigger Renewed Altcoin Interest Ethereum is the main altcoin to watch next week as it could lead the altcoin rally, especially with the ETHDenver 2025 conference starting on February 23. This major event focuses on Ethereum and often sparks the introduction of new projects, updates on Layer 2 technology, and developments in decentralized finance (DeFi). With increasing interest from institutions in Ethereum staking and rollups, any major announcements or partnerships at the conference could significantly increase Ethereum’s value. Moreover, the recent buzz around the SOL ETF could help boost Solana’s price. Overall, any regulatory changes or news could pave the way for a rebound in altcoin prices. Solana Price Analysis The crypto market is bouncing back, leading to a significant price correction for SOL after the Bybit hack. Buyers are currently sending the price above the 23.6% Fib channel. Currently, SOL is trading at $171, having dropped by 0.2% in the last 24 hours. The SOL/USDT trading pair is facing challenges under $180, showing that sellers have strong control at this level. This could be a significant barrier as short-term holders might keep selling off at this price. However, if demand increases, buyers could potentially push past this level soon. If the price drops below the EMA20 trend line on the 1-hour chart, sellers might attempt to drive it down to the $160 support level. Meanwhile, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovering around the midline at 46, it could lead to a retest of the upper resistance channel. If the price stays above $180, it would be advantageous for buyers, possibly driving the price up to $219. Story (IP) Price Analysis Story has seen a notable drop after buyers failed to maintain the level at $9. This drop has weakened buyer confidence to push the price upwards. Currently, IP price is trading at $4.46, having dropped by 0.4% in the last 24 hours. The IP/USDT trading pair is aiming for $5.3 but could face significant resistance, potentially leading to a fallback to the $4 range. Nevertheless, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 48, just around the midline, Story price might continue to see strong buying interest. If the price breaks above $5.3, a correction towards $6.9 could follow. On the other hand, if it falls below $4.1, the price could drop to around $3. Ethereum Price Analysis Ethereum price rebounded strongly following the Bybit hack. Buyers pushed the price of ETH to the key level of $2,800. As of writing, ETH price trades at $2,826, surging over 2.3% in the last 24 hours. If Ether moves below the 20-day EMA of $2,737, sellers might try to drive the ETH/USDT pair below $2,500. If successful, the price could drop further to $2,400 and possibly down to $2,300. Conversely, if the price climbs above $2,850, it might reach the downtrend line. While sellers are likely to defend this level, if buyers manage to break through, the pair could surge toward $3,300.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Ethereum|Solana,EN,0,0,TRADING|ETH|SOL|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-23 08:18:18

The platform features could make it easy for anyone to accept crypto payments. The London-based fintech platform is having a successful presale, raising around $1 million so far, and this is because investors are rushing to the ecosystem to position themselves in what could become the future of payment. Many people believe in the potential of SpacePay and its SPY token to change the way finance is done, and this could easily make the solution valuable to everyone. SpacePay offers a new payment system, but rather than requiring users to get new devices and wallets, it works easily with existing payment and point-of-sale machines and more than 325 wallets. With this, users don’t have to incur the expenses of getting new payment devices. With this, it is easy for many people and businesses to use SpacePay’s solution since they are only required to continue using the system they are accustomed to. Additionally, accepting crypto payments can open up businesses to a new customer base, as people who wish to pay with crypto could be eager to use such stores. How SpacePay Gets the Job Done for Users SpacePay uses various methods to ensure that crypto payments are seamless and more efficient than cash payments. One of the ways is to protect funds from the effects of volatility. When a crypto payment is made, merchants can choose to receive them in the fiat currencies of their choice. An automatic conversion to fiat currency ensures that the value of the funds stays the same, regardless of fluctuations in crypto price during the transaction. The $SPY raise continues! Join a revolution in crypto payments. SpacePay is the bridge merchants need. pic.twitter.com/3NhITlSNvZ — SpacePay (@SpacePayLtd) January 22, 2025 SpacePay’s solution is cost-efficient, as it charges only a 0.5% merchant fee. This straightforward pricing makes it easy to determine how much a merchant will receive during payment. The platform is built to be transparent with pricing and does not impose hidden charges. Another feature the platform offers is the instant settlement of transactions. There is no processing time, unlike a traditional payment system that can sometimes take days to settle. This efficient system has been attracting many to the SpacePay ecosystem. SpacePay Growth Plans and Strategies The presale is part of the plan to bring many people to the ecosystem and form a strong community. The platform carried out a contract audit and is already working on its NFC technology. After the presale, there will be centralized exchange listings, which will allow more people to trade the SPY token, potentially increasing its trading volume and visibility. The platform will launch various payment partnerships to ensure that it continues to provide optimal services to its users. There will also be various API integrations and reward models aimed at rewarding the community and encouraging the constant use of the platform. In addition to all these, the developers will carry out various developments to ensure global expansion and brand establishment. This will involve expanding their marketing reach and strategies, as well as carrying out various scaling operations and bringing features that will enhance user experience and the platform’s offerings. Exclusive Benefits of Holding the SPY Token Holding the SPY token has its own exclusive advantages, such as always having access to a revenue-sharing model where a part of the platform’s revenue is shared with the community members as passive income. Apart from this, token holders will have the right to vote on various features within the platform. This ensures that it continues to grow based on the desires of token holders, who obviously want the best for the project. SpacePay will also reward active participation on the platform through a monthly loyalty airdrop. This is to reward the most active participants within the community with some SPY tokens to encourage constant use of the platform and holding of the token. The SPY holders will also have access to the SpacePay leadership team through quarterly Connect webinars, where they will be able to access more information about the platform’s growth and plans. There is a total supply of 34 billion SPY tokens. 20% of this total supply is allocated for the ongoing presale, 18% is allocated for marketing and community building, and another 18% is set aside for strategic partnerships. 17% is allocated for rewards and loyalty, 12% for a reserve fund, 10% goes for development, and the last 5% is allocated to the team or founding members. SpacePay Presale and Its Offers The ongoing presale has raised nearly $1 million, demonstrating strong investor interest in its crypto payment solutions. The SPY token is available at a favorable price of $0.003126 during this presale phase. Buying the token during the presale offers early access and growth at a reduced price. This purchase price might increase after the official launch. Becoming an SPY token holder is easy. To purchase, connect a decentralized wallet using MetaMask or any other compatible wallet to the SpacePay website . Authorize the transaction with ETH, BNB, MATIC, USDT, USDC, AVAX, BASE, or even a bank card.

In the video attached to the tweet, Garlinghouse addressed the concept of payment friction and how advancements in digital assets, including XRP, could revolutionize payroll systems by enabling instant and continuous compensation. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse on removing payment friction: ""Has everybody thought about why you get paid once a month, or once every 2 weeks? It comes down to the friction of payments. And if we can remove the friction of payments, why can't you get paid every day? Or every… pic.twitter.com/PmH0QDJC0q — Rowen Exchange (@RowenExchange) February 22, 2025 The Problem of Payment Friction Garlinghouse began by posing a fundamental question: why do people typically get paid once a month or every two weeks? He explained that the traditional payroll system is not necessarily based on efficiency or worker preference but rather on the friction inherent in financial transactions. Payment processing, banking constraints, and legacy financial infrastructure have dictated the intervals at which salaries are disbursed. He highlighted that in countries like Singapore, employees are usually paid monthly, while in the United States, a biweekly pay schedule is common. This structure has been accepted as the norm for decades, yet it is primarily a byproduct of the limitations within traditional financial systems. The Potential for Real-Time Payments Garlinghouse suggested that by eliminating the friction associated with payments, employees could theoretically receive their wages in real time. He stated, “If we can remove the friction of payments, why can’t you get paid every day? Or even more crazily, why don’t you get paid every hour or every second?” He describes a scenario where a value could continuously be deposited into a user’s preferred repository of funds without delay. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This concept aligns with the broader vision of blockchain technology and digital assets, which aim to facilitate instantaneous and low-cost transactions. With the advent of solutions like XRP and the technologies built on the XRP Ledger , near-instant financial transactions could become a reality for businesses and workers worldwide. Economic and Social Implications Garlinghouse acknowledged that shifting to real-time payments could trigger unpredictable secondary and tertiary effects. As technological advancements in previous decades led to unforeseen innovations, reducing payment friction could fundamentally alter workplace dynamics, financial management, and spending habits. A response to Rowen Exchange’s tweet from an X user named Christi echoed this sentiment, emphasizing that more frequent payments could reshape work culture. Christi argued that employees being paid in real-time would reinforce the direct connection between labor and earnings, potentially leading to increased productivity, fewer instances of absenteeism, and even reduced reliance on government assistance programs. The Role of XRP in Enabling Instant Transactions The final line of Rowen Exchange’s tweet—“XRP MAKES THE IMPOSSIBLE, POSSIBLE”—underscores the role of digital assets in overcoming existing financial barriers. XRP has long been positioned as a solution for fast, cost-effective cross-border payments, but its potential use cases extend far beyond remittances. The ability to settle transactions in seconds with minimal fees could make it a viable tool for businesses seeking to implement real-time payroll systems.

40722087,https://coinpedia.org/?p=423772,1740299198,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Web2 Giants Are Playing Their Part to Support Crypto Purchases Everywhere,https://coinpedia.org/information/web2-giants-are-playing-their-part-to-support-crypto-purchases-everywhere/,"The post Web2 Giants Are Playing Their Part to Support Crypto Purchases Everywhere appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Once upon a time, crypto was called the wild west, an arid playground run by cowboys with wallets full of BTC and dreams of Lambos. Fast forward to 2025, and that rugged landscape’s been significantly tamed – but has retained its ability to consistently surprise. One of the more pleasant surprises to have surfaced in recent years has been the willingness of businesses once branded the enemy of crypto to support its infiltration into every payment systems. Web2 giants – those familiar names powering your online life – are saddling up, bringing their muscle to the crypto corral. PayPal, Visa, Mastercard: they’re all cantering in, and it’s a genuine game-changer. Why? Because when these titans join the party, crypto stops being a fringe fantasy and starts feeling like something you’d actually use on the daily. They don’t often receive credit for their Damascene conversion, but plaudits are due for the web2 players who’ve come full circle. Financial Players with Skin in the Game Let’s start with the big guns. PayPal kicked things off in 2020, letting users buy, sell, and hold cryptos such as BTC and ETH. By 2024, they’d upped the ante, integrating stablecoin PYUSD and rolling it out to 430 million users worldwide. Visa’s not far behind; since 2021, they’ve settled over $2.5 billion in crypto-linked transactions. Mastercard, meanwhile, are pushing crypto debit cards and piloting blockchain payments. From a user perspective, it means that if you’re already on PayPal or swiping a Visa, crypto’s not a leap – it’s a sidestep. These giants are effectively turning “what’s a wallet?” into “oh, I already have that.” Neo-banks, the cool kids bridging old money and new, are also doing a lot of the heavy lifting here. Take Crypto.com , over 80 million users strong and with billboards at seemingly every major sporting event. Great name, globally recognizable brand. They’ve just added PayPal as a payment method, letting you fund your crypto buys straight from your PayPal balance. This means no interminable transfers, no extra apps: just seamless integration into a platform you already trust. It’s like adding crypto to your financial toolbox without needing a manual. Neo-banks like Crypto.com aren’t so much lowering crypto’s adoption curve as steam-rollering it till it’s pancake flat. Don’t Forget the Partnerships Driving Adoption Web3 projects love a good partnership announcement, and in collaborating with web2’s major players, they’ve inked deals that are more than mere vapor. PayPal and Visa teamed up last year to streamline crypto payouts – think freelancers getting paid in USDC via Visa Direct. Mastercard’s collab with wallet providers like MetaMask and Trust Wallet, meanwhile, let users top up cards with crypto in seconds. Then there’s Mercuryo , the rising fintech star, partnering with web3 heavyweights like Polygon and now powering euro crypto cards with Mastercard. These tie-ups aren’t just headlines; they’re highways, paving the way for crypto to flow into everyday life. Whether you position it as a web2 player streamlining access to web3 or vice-versa, the upshot is that Mercuryo and other payment providers are now mainstays for much of the money that flows between the on- and off-chain worlds 24/7. Why Now? What’s fueling this fire in web2 giants? They’re not entering web3 out of FOMO – they’re smarter than that. Rather, their decision to support the cryptoconomy rather than sit it out on the sidelines is driven by more rational reasoning. With much of the regulatory risk and “exoticness” of crypto having been tempered, it’s a lot safer for these TradFi titans to enter the fray. And there’s money for them to make by connecting the old world with the new. As for the competencies they bring to bear within the crypto arena, first there’s user experience: we’re talking apps so intuitive even your grandma could buy ETH. Second, there’s security: Visa’s fraud protection and PayPal’s two-factor authentication make crypto feel less like a gamble. Third, familiarity: linking crypto to Apple Pay, Google Pay, or your trusty Visa card shrinks the learning curve to a blip. That’s the vibe: safe, simple, and second nature. Case Studies: The Proof’s in the Pudding The partnership between Mercuryo and MetaMask is a masterstroke for simplifying crypto onboarding. Their integration lets users buy crypto with a bank card in under a minute – no wrestling with seed phrases or navigating convoluted exchange signups. By tapping into Mercuryo’s payment infrastructure, MetaMask users can fund their wallets seamlessly, whether it’s ETH for gas fees or stablecoins for DeFi. Mercuryo’s not stopping there. Their focus on localized solutions, such as SEPA transfers in Europe or OVO in Indonesia, means users globally can jump into web3 without friction. The MetaMask hookup has evolved with features like no-KYC purchases up to €699, slashing barriers for newcomers. Users appear to be relishing the ability to top up their wallet with a tap, then spend via Mercuryo’s Mastercard-backed crypto card. It’s a full-circle play: buy crypto fast, spend it faster. PayPal has been a crypto trailblazer since 2020, with 35 million merchants and crypto trading live since 2021. They’ve onboarded millions to crypto, leveraging a user base of 430 million. The real kicker? Their stablecoin, PYUSD , launched in 2023 with Paxos, is now a checkout option across their network. Moving beyond mere hodling, PayPal’s pushing real spending: users can settle tabs with PYUSD at merchants or send it fee-free to friends in the U.S. It’s crypto with training wheels, wrapped in a familiar interface. The numbers back it up: PYUSD’s market cap has climbed past $700 million, fueled by integrations like Venmo and Crypto.com. PayPal’s not just playing in web3; they’re reshaping it for the mainstream. With no fees for buying, selling, or sending PYUSD within their ecosystem (network fees apply externally), PayPal’s betting on trust and scale. It’s a bold pivot from their 1998 roots, proving they can still make an impact on the evolution of digital finance. As a final case study to indicate the role web2 giants are now playing, Visa’s launch of Visa+ is a slick move to link digital wallets for instant payments and their crypto ambitions shine through. A pilot with Coinbase in 2024 saw 10,000 users moving USDC cross-border without the usual remittance headaches. Built on blockchains like Solana, Visa+ leverages stablecoin speed (think sub-second settlement) while keeping the familiar swipe-and-go vibe. It’s a lifeline for freelancers or small businesses, cutting costs that legacy systems like SWIFT pile on. What This Means for Traditional Users For the average Joe, all of this is good news. Barriers are rapidly crumbling and crypto’s no longer a techie’s toy. The interfaces mimic your banking app, so the learning curve’s virtually non-existent. There’s also the deep trust that comes when Visa or PayPal’s involved – these aren’t shady startups. A 2024 Deloitte survey found 62% of U.S. adults would try crypto if offered by a known brand. That’s the web2 effect: turning skeptics into spenders, one big brand at a time. And all of this is just the warmup. Imagine crypto woven into every transaction: paying rent with ETH via PayPal, splitting dinner with Visa+ in USDC. Web2 giants aren’t stopping at buying and selling; they’re eyeing loyalty programs and cross-border micropayments. By 2030, Statista predicts 20% of global payments could involve crypto if integration keeps accelerating. Web2 giants are no longer the NPCs playing a bit part in crypto adoption: they’re web3’s wingmen, dragging the industry from the fringes to the forefront. PayPal, Visa, Mercuryo and their ilk are rewriting digital finance, making it less about geeky experimentation and more about everyday ease. As these titans flex their reach, crypto’s shedding its mystique for something better: everyday utility.",Information,EN,0,0,PYUSD|ETH|USDC|BTC|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-23 08:26:38

With 94% of the first phase sold at $0.01 per token, the window for accessing the lowest price is closing rapidly. Phase 2, which starts soon after, will include a 50% price jump to $0.015. Those entering now stand to lock in a guaranteed 600% return by launch, a surge to $0.06 that’s already baked into the token’s trajectory. Moreover, analysts project a 100x leap to $1 in 2025 when Mutuum Finance’s decentralized lending platform goes live. Dogecoin (DOGE) shows similar potential for a dollar milestone, fueled by technical patterns and ETF speculation. Tron (TRX), however, struggles to break key resistance levels, hinting at a longer wait for its bullish turnaround. Dogecoin Battles Bearish Trends Amid Long-Term Optimism Dogecoin’s price has tumbled 45% since December, sliding from $0.48 to $0.26 as Bitcoin’s stagnation drags the broader crypto market lower. The meme coin’s decline accelerated after January’s “sell the news” reaction to Elon Musk’s advisory role in the Trump administration, a development initially met with enthusiasm. With the crypto fear and greed index plunging to 39 (from 88 earlier this year), DOGE faces headwinds. Yet technical charts suggest a rebound is brewing. A weekly Elliott Wave analysis identifies the current slump as Wave Two, a corrective phase following September’s 180% rally. Historically, Wave Three surges are the longest and strongest, potentially propelling DOGE to $0.76 before a pullback and final ascent to $1. This pattern mirrors 2023’s cycle, where a 63% crash preceded a 200% rebound. Tron’s Slow Grind Faces Uphill Battle Tron (TRX) inches upward by 4% today to $0.24, buoyed by Bitcoin’s modest recovery. The token trades within a bullish channel, testing the $0.249 resistance critical for reaching $0.30. While partnerships with Bitget and Chainlink boosted Q4 transaction volume by 7%, TRX lacks the catalysts driving DOGE and MUTM. Analysts note that breaking $0.249 requires sustained buying pressure, a challenge given TRON’s reliance on broader market sentiment rather than unique utility. Even if successful, the path to $1 demands a 400% climb, a feat unlikely before 2026 given its incremental growth patterns. Mutuum Finance Emerges as the Presale Powerhouse Mutuum Finance (MUTM) dominates attention with a presale that’s rewriting playbooks. The project has raised $1.03 million in days, attracting over 2,010 holders eager to capitalize on its $0.01 entry price. Phase One’s 94% sell-out rate signals intense demand, with a 50% price hike looming in Phase Two. Early buyers aren’t just banking on hype, MUTM’s structured ecosystem, featuring peer-to-contract lending, an overcollateralized stablecoin, and a token buyback system, positions it as a DeFi staple. Tokens purchased today will automatically surge 600% to $0.06 at launch as presale phases incrementally raise prices. Post-launch, platform adoption is expected to fuel a climb to $1 in 2025. Here’s why: 20% of all borrowing fees will fund daily MUTM buybacks, redistributing tokens to stakers and creating relentless upward pressure. Combined with a live beta platform at launch, a rarity for presale projects, Mutuum Finance eliminates the “vaporware” risk plaguing other tokens. A $100,000 giveaway sweetens the deal, rewarding early participants who engage on social media. With only 6% of Phase One tokens remaining, the project exemplifies a rare convergence of low risk and explosive upside. As Dogecoin leans on technical rebounds and Tron battles inertia, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands apart with tangible growth mechanisms and a presale selling out faster than morning headlines. The crypto market’s 2025 story may well be defined by MUTM’s ascent, a journey beginning at $0.01 and eyeing $1 within 12 months. Investors chasing life-changing gains are prioritizing this token, knowing Phase One’s discounted window won’t last. Time Is Running Out, Secure Your Position Today The crypto market rarely offers guarantees, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) comes close. A 600% gain by launch is locked in for Phase One buyers, with a $1 target in 2025 backed by buyback mechanics and real-world utility. Dogecoin’s potential hinges on unpredictable macro trends, while Tron’s gradual rise pales next to MUTM’s trajectory. With under 6% of the first phase remaining, the choice is clear, join the presale now or watch this opportunity vanish like last year’s Bitcoin dip. Visit Mutuum Finance’s official site to purchase MUTM tokens before prices spike, your portfolio will thank you in 2025.

40722628,https://timestabloid.com/?p=58234,1740299429,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,AI Prediction Shows Solana Price Hitting $338.20 & 1Fuel (OFT) 143x In Just A Matter Of 3 Months,https://timestabloid.com/ai-prediction-shows-solana-price-hitting-338-20-1fuel-oft/,"The future of Solana is predicted by AI driven analysis that thinks it might rise to $338.20 in a matter of months, gaining the attention of investors. The real shocker, though, is 1Fuel (OFT), which is set to surge an unbelievable 143x in the same period. Early investors are rushing to stake out positions before the next big wave as demand for high growth opportunities rises. Let’s explore what’s driving these bold predictions and why 1Fuel could be the ultimate breakout token. SOLANA: Can It Hit $338.20? Solana has demonstrated itself as one of the quickest and most scalable blockchain networks in the blockchain space. At $172.89, it is currently trading below its all time high, but has been mostly resilient to market fluctuations. SOLANA PRICE PREDICTION is based on growing network adoption, rising transaction volumes, and potential institutional interest, suggesting a move to $338.20. The potential launch of a Solana based ETF is a key factor behind this prediction. A rapid price surge could follow the flow of institutional funds into Solana. Yet skeptics argue that aggressive forecasts like this would be overly ambitious given Solana’s dependence on retail trading activity. If market conditions worsen, some analysts predict a dip to $153. Solana’s dominance in NFT and DeFi markets is another key driver for this Solana price prediction. Due to the low transaction costs and high speed transactions, Solana has become the go to blockchain for many developers, mostly in the area of gaming and other Web3 applications. While Solana’s network strength cannot be overlooked, it would not be an easy feat to reach $338.20 in three months without a major market wide bullish run or a surge in DeFi and NFT adoption. However, there are risks. First SOL needs to break past the $250 resistance zone for it to hit $338.20. If it doesn’t do so, it could prolong its consolidation phase leaving the next move up delayed. In the crypto space, where volatility is a given, investors should take into account the risks of big bets. 1Fuel’s 143x Potential: More Than Just Hype? The 1Fuel presale has already begun to deliver immediate returns for crypto market expansion potential, but Solana’s crypto market expansion potential is dependent on external factors. Those who got in early have already captured 80% growth, as the project has raised over $2.3 million in presale funding. What makes 1Fuel different from pure speculative assets is it has cross chain capabilities and peer to peer transaction security. Unlike Solana, which is already a fully functioning blockchain, 1Fuel is very much in its early growth stages, where the bulk of returns usually happen. Investors, meanwhile, are getting extra benefits with a structured presale model, such as a 40% purchase bonus for new buyers before the February 23rd deadline. The most aggressive SOLANA PRICE PREDICTION indicates a 96% increase, while 1Fuel’s 143x predicted return is based on early market positioning. If the project were to fulfil its roadmap, its price post launch could shoot up and yield the kind of returns top tier blockchains rarely achieve. Conclusion 1Fuel’s 143x potential and 40% purchase bonus provides a more immediate buy-upside for those willing to take a calculated risk. There’s still a possibility that Solana could remain a viable contender, but it is 1Fuel’s presale that is attracting serious attention of traders eyeing up the next high reward opportunity. Early investors are making their move with only days to go before its bonus deadline. Get ready to take part in the explosive growth potential of 1Fuel and join its presale today.

Toncoin aims to provide fast, scalable, and decentralized solutions for the Web3 space. What sets Toncoin apart is its focus on scalability—unlike many other blockchains that struggle with slow transaction speeds and high fees, Toncoin is designed to handle millions of transactions per second with low fees. Telegram’s backing is also a significant factor in Toncoin’s success. With over 500 million active users, Telegram offers an enormous potential user base that could drive the adoption of Toncoin.

An address suspected to be affiliated with Bybit (0x2E…1b77) recently purchased 100 million USDT from address 0xEC…B5E76 and allocated 50 million USDT each to Galaxy Digital and FalconX OTC addresses. This transaction enabled the purchase of approximately 36,900 ETH, which was then deposited to Bybit. In a subsequent transaction, Bybit purchased an additional 17,500 ETH through Galaxy Digital’s OTC services. Additionally, over an 11-hour period, the suspicious Bybit address (0x2E…1b77) purchased an additional 34,800 ETH, which was deposited into Bybit, transferring $48 million to Galaxy Digital and FalconX.

The 48-year-old businessman from Ahmedabad had a redefining moment in the digital era, learning his lesson the hard way. According to reports, the elaborate scam began like any other friendly interaction on the messaging app, with the perpetrator sending the Indian businessman a friend request and him approving it. Things soon moved quickly, with both parties sharing contacts before the victim was introduced to the crypto investment platform. According to authorities, it turned out that the investment opportunity turned out to be a scam. Indian businessman falls for elaborate crypto investment scam According to the complaint registered with the Cybercrime unit of the Police, the pair first met in August 2024 on Facebook. The Indian businessman received a friend request on Facebook from a beautiful woman. According to the complaint, the woman claimed to be involved in gym equipment businesses, offering services in Dubai and Mumbai. In their usual modus operandi, the scammer reached out to the man after seeing his profile. “Hey, your profile caught my eye while checking my friends’ suggestions, and thought I would reach out. Can we get to know each other?” the scammer asked. After he responded to their chats, they began to talk and soon moved things from Facebook to WhatsApp. After a while, she made her move, introducing him to a lucrative cryptocurrency investment opportunity. According to the chats, she mentioned that her uncle was a high-ranking officer at the American firm in charge of the platform and would help the Indian businessman out. The Indian businessman mentioned that he went online to research the company and discovered it was legitimate. He mentioned that he saw that they promised a high return on investment, leading him to invest $500 in the beginning, and he received a $250 profit on the investment. Encouraged by the return, he began to send more funds to the platform, with his funds on the platform totaling about Rs 6 crore ($692k). Authorities register a complaint against the scammer According to the Indian businessman, things started to look like it was a scam when he tried to withdraw from his investment, and he was asked to pay a 20% tax upfront. He mentioned that he was not told about this initially, and he tried to contact the woman without success. This is typical for crimes like these, where the criminals try to maintain contact to have their victims send as much money as they can, and as soon as they realize that their scam is blown, they cut communications, taking the money and trying to hide before they strike again. Authorities mentioned that after the woman became unreachable, further research into the investment platform showed that it was an elaborate scam. The man mentioned that he was only able to get only Rs. 92,000 from his entire Rs. 1.92 crore investment, leading him to go to the police to report to the cybercrime unit. The police have filed a complaint for criminal conspiracy, cheating by impersonation, and criminal breach of trust against the unidentified offender. The scam also shows that people still need education about the crypto sector. The criminals used the ignorance of the businessman about the crypto sector against him, leading him to part with a heavy amount of money. Authorities have also warned the general public about individuals proposing crypto investment schemes, as they are usually fake. Traders and residents interested in carrying out activities in the crypto market are advised to go to seasoned professionals and trusted platforms to carry out their activities. That way, they run a lesser risk of losing their funds to criminals.

The entire crypto market has faced heightened volatility and instability following weeks of selling pressure. Investors remain on edge after Friday’s Bybit hack, which saw $1.5 billion worth of ETH stolen, further fueling market-wide fear and caution. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Serious Price Compression – What Happened Last Time Despite the uncertainty, Chainlink is showing signs of strength. Key data from Glassnode reveals that Chainlink network growth is accelerating, with the number of new $LINK addresses surging to 2,298—its highest level since January. This spike in network activity suggests increasing adoption and renewed interest from investors, potentially signaling a shift in sentiment for the oracle-based cryptocurrency. As Chainlink continues to consolidate at key demand levels, traders are watching closely for a potential breakout. A strong recovery in network growth could translate into higher buying pressure, helping LINK reclaim critical resistance levels and break out of its current range. However, if bearish sentiment persists, LINK could struggle to maintain support, leading to further downside. With the market at a pivotal point, the coming days will be crucial in determining whether Chainlink can capitalize on its growing network activity and push higher. Chainlink Grows Amid Uncertainty Chainlink has continued to expand despite the broader market uncertainty and volatility, demonstrating resilience even as prices struggle to break above key resistance levels. While many altcoins have faced extreme selling pressure in recent weeks, LINK has held strong above crucial demand zones, maintaining its position as a top-performing project in the Oracle sector. One of the key drivers of Chainlink’s strength is its continued strategic partnerships, including its collaboration with XRP, which highlights the growing demand for reliable decentralized data solutions in the blockchain space. As the market looks ahead, Chainlink investors remain optimistic about the project’s potential in 2024. Many analysts expect LINK to have a bullish year, with increasing adoption fueling further price appreciation. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared Glassnode data on X, revealing that Chainlink network growth is accelerating significantly. The number of new LINK addresses has surged to 2,298, its highest level since January. This surge in network activity suggests growing investor interest and adoption, both of which are typically bullish indicators for price action.

Price Action Details: Testing Crucial Demand Chainlink (LINK) is currently trading at $17 after multiple attempts to reclaim the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) around the $18 level. Bulls are facing a critical moment as LINK consolidates below key resistance, struggling to gain enough momentum for a breakout. If buyers step in and reclaim the $18 level, the next major hurdle will be the psychological $20 mark. A strong push above this level could trigger an aggressive rally into higher price targets, setting the stage for a bullish continuation. However, if LINK fails to hold the $17 support level, the price could face renewed selling pressure, leading to a potential drop into lower demand zones. Given the current market uncertainty, investors are closely monitoring these levels to determine the next directional move. The recent increase in new Chainlink addresses, as reported by Glassnode, suggests growing investor interest, which could provide the necessary fuel for an uptrend.

Apple recently disabled its data security tools for customers in the UK after the United Kingdom government demanded that the iPhone maker turn over user data to British authorities. This move means that Apple and the government can now access the previously private data of Apple’s UK users. In its defense, Apple claims that more sensitive information like communications over text and phone calls will remain end-to-end encrypted. Predictably, iPhone users in the UK are unhappy about this situation. Tom Harwood, British journalist, political commentator, and television show host, took to the X (formerly Twitter) social media platform to express his displeasure with the situation stating, “No UK customer data stored on iCloud will be encrypted, making it all accessible by Apple, the Government, and – frankly – the most horrific hackers you can possibly imagine. Imagine the blackmail, extortion, and identity theft the government is bringing on its own citizens.” Apple’s compliance with the UK government’s demands Apple introduced the Advanced Data Protection (ADP) feature in late 2022 to provide end-to-end encryption for iCloud backups. That way, only users can access their own iCloud data using their passwords. However, the UK government, while citing the Investigatory Powers Act of 2016 , filed a secret order for Apple to remove the ADP feature for UK customers. Without the ADP’s encryption, the UK government can have Apple provide access to encrypted users’ iCloud data upon request. There have been other moments when Apple’s security measures have caused tension with law enforcement and governments. In 2016, Apple was in a standoff with law enforcement after it refused to unlock the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone. Choosing to remove the ADP feature for UK customers entirely means that Apple has acquiesced to compromise its encryption standards. This decision also means that UK users’ iCloud data is no longer protected by end-to-end encryption. Apple can now access the data its UK uses store on their iClouds, by extension, the government under lawful requests, and by extension, bad actors with the equipment or clearance. While Apple has said it is disappointed over this outcome, it maintains that certain data categories, such as iCloud Keychain passwords, health app data, and communications on iMessage and FaceTime, will continue to be end-to-end encrypted. Vitalik Buterin weighs in In response to the UK’s demands and Apple’s subsequent compliance, Buterin shared his disapproval on his X account. Vitalik urged security agencies like the United States National Security Agency (NSA) and the United Kingdom’s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) to work towards enhancing citizens’ digital security. “Glad to see this backdoor push getting a much-deserved smackdown,” Vitalik tweeted in response to a tweet by Rt. Hon Ben Wallace, former UK Secretary of State for Defense. Vitalik pointed out the inherent dangers of centralized data collection points such as government or corporate databases, noting that they are susceptible to access by various adversaries. Buterin recalled the Louisiana drivers’ license cyber attack to support his argument.

This has resulted in increased demand for facilities that offer quality crypto signals and insights. For investors looking to find underrated altcoins, meme coin gems, and for traders looking to make huge profits alike, these crypto signals could serve as a significant advantage. Below, we list some of the best crypto signal entities that have been gaining traction lately. Best Crypto Signals in 2025 Best Wallet Crypto wallets are no longer just digital vaults for storing assets—they’ve evolved into multifunctional platforms that serve as trading assistants, market trackers, and signal providers. Best Wallet exemplifies this transformation, aiming to build a fully integrated crypto ecosystem for its users. Rather than making investors sift through endless Telegram groups and Discord servers, Best Wallet compiles underrated crypto gems, market analytics, and trading insights directly within the app. This means users aren’t just storing their tokens; they’re also discovering promising new projects and gaining access to high-quality data that can help them make profitable decisions. $10M raised and Best Wallet keeps growing! 🔥Holding $BEST isn’t just about being part of the fastest-growing crypto wallet. It comes with real advantages that put you ahead of the game:✅ Exclusive Airdrop Rewards✅ Alpha on The Hottest New Tokens✅ Total Control in One… pic.twitter.com/mRJp7jorsG — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) February 17, 2025 The project’s community and several crypto signal website lists have already dubbed Best Wallet one of the best Web3-themed storage solutions in the space, primarily due to its focus on building a variety of features around its primary use case. Its native token offering was also introduced with a presale not long ago and has managed to raise more than $10 million already—another achievement that indicates the rising demand for the platform as a whole. Best Wallet’s Upcoming Tokens feature plays a major role here, highlighting new launches before they hit the mainstream radar. Add in real-time market indicators, graphical data insights, and portfolio tracking, and you have a crypto wallet that doubles as an advanced investment tool. For those who prefer a more streamlined approach without bouncing between multiple platforms, Best Wallet is positioning itself as a one-stop solution—combining secure asset management with premium market intelligence. Jacob Crypto Bury Not all crypto influencers provide actual value, but Jacob Crypto Bury has built a reputation for delivering well-researched insights rather than just chasing trends. His Patreon-based subscription model offers structured access to exclusive trade setups, while his Discord communities serve as interactive hubs where members receive free calls, engage in discussions, and track market developments in real time. His ability to identify high-growth projects even before their official launches has drawn in traders looking for early-stage opportunities. While many influencers focus on hype, Jacob’s approach is data-driven and analytical, helping his community differentiate between genuine opportunities and short-term speculation. Jacob also recently posted a video on his YouTube channel where he asked AI to come up with the best crypto signals, and his Discord came up as one of the best options in the market—an impressive feat that has helped him build more trust with his followers. The structured tiers on Jacob’s Patreon allow members to pick a plan that fits their risk appetite, while the free calls ensure that even casual investors can benefit from his insights. Whether it's market breakdowns, technical analysis, or just solid trade ideas, Jacob Crypto Bury has carved out a space as a reliable voice in the crypto trading world. Crypto Whale Pumps For those who prefer real-time, no-nonsense trade signals, Crypto Whale Pumps delivers exactly that. The platform skips unnecessary frills and directs users straight to its Telegram channel, where its founder actively shares premium insights and trading strategies. The service costs $100 per month, but within the community, this is seen as an amount that can be quickly recouped through smart trades. The focus here is on early-stage token plays, futures trading setups, and high-potential altcoins, allowing subscribers to catch major moves before they gain wider attention. Unlike some overly complex signal groups, Crypto Whale Pumps keeps things straightforward and actionable, with clear entry and exit points, risk management strategies, and an emphasis on discipline rather than reckless trading. For traders who want direct access to a structured trading approach without unnecessary distractions, this Telegram-based platform has proven itself as a go-to resource. WallStreetBets If there’s one name that defines modern-day degenerate trading culture, it’s WallStreetBets. What started as a Reddit movement during the GameStop saga has evolved into one of the largest and most chaotic trading communities across social media. The group is not run by a central authority—there’s no official ""leader"" handing out trading calls, which means that while it offers fantastic insight into market sentiment, it also requires traders to exercise caution. Discussions range from high-risk leverage trading to meme coin speculation, and while many profitable plays originate from these forums, it's essential to cross-check any information before acting on it. The key takeaway? WallStreetBets is an incredible tool for gauging market hype, identifying early trends, and staying ahead of speculative movements, but it should never be treated as a fully reliable source for trading signals. Those who engage with the community and conduct their own research can find gold, but blindly following posts without verification is a quick way to get liquidated. Learn2Trade For traders who prefer structured, technical analysis-backed signals, Learn2Trade provides one of the most organized crypto signal services available today. Rather than relying purely on market sentiment or speculative plays, the platform uses technical indicators, chart patterns, and real-time market data to generate accurate trade setups. The service operates on a freemium model, with a free Telegram group offering three signals per week, while the premium subscription provides three signals daily. Unlike some providers that throw out vague trade ideas, Learn2Trade delivers precise entry, stop-loss, and take-profit levels, ensuring that traders have a clear roadmap to follow. The platform isn’t just about signals—it also offers market analysis, educational content, and forex trading insights, making it a comprehensive resource for those who want a more methodical approach to crypto trading. Whether you’re a casual trader looking for occasional insights or an active participant who needs consistent signals, Learn2Trade stands out as a well-rounded option for structured and disciplined trading. Conclusion The demand for crypto signals has undoubtedly surged alongside increasing investor participation in the market. However, not all signals are created equal, and blindly following unreliable sources can lead to avoidable losses. The key to making the most out of crypto trading signals is trust—ensuring that the provider has a proven track record, clear strategies, and a transparent approach to risk management. As the bull run continues to unfold, having access to high-quality trading signals could prove to be an invaluable asset. Choosing reputable providers like the ones mentioned above ensures that investors stay ahead of trends, make informed decisions, and maximize their gains without falling into the trap of misleading or speculative calls. With the right signal provider, traders can capitalize on opportunities with confidence while managing risk effectively.

Most altcoins are also quite sluggish on a daily scale, while ETH has gained 3%, which is somewhat surprising, given its role in the aforementioned attack. BTC Stands Above $96K After last Friday’s unsuccessful attempt to break $99,000, the primary cryptocurrency spent the previous weekend trading sideways at around $97,000. The business week began on the wrong foot as the asset dropped to $95,500 on Monday and even further south on Tuesday – to $93,500. This became its lowest price point in over two weeks. However, the bulls managed to intervene at this point and didn’t allow another correction. In contrast, bitcoin started to recover some ground and went on the offensive on Friday. Following positive news from Coinbase in regards to its lawsuit against the SEC, BTC’s price climbed to a 13-day peak of $99,500. As the community was preparing for another charge at $100,000, the landscape in the entire crypto industry changed as Bybit was compromised in what has become the largest hack against a digital asset company when $1.5 billion in ETH was siphoned from one of its hot wallets. BTC reacted immediately, with its price tumbling by over four grand in hours. Nevertheless, it managed to bounce off on Saturday and jumped above $96,000 where it currently stands as well. Its market cap has remained at $1.910 trillion, while its dominance over the alts has taken a hit and is down to 57.5%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView OM on the Run Most larger-cap alts are with minor gains over the past 24 hours. This includes BNB, DOGE, ADA, TRX, LINK, XLM, AVAX, LTC, and SUI. Ethereum and Toncoin have added more than 3% of value within the same timeframe and now sit above $2,800 and close to $3.8, respectively. However, OM has stolen the show from the larger-cap alts. Mantra’s native token has soared by roughly 12% in the past day and now trades well above $8.5. Minor losses are evident from XRP, SOL HBAR, WBT, HYPE, MNT, ONDO, and a few others.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Bitcoin ( BTC ) maximalist Samson Mow says the leading smart contract platform by volume should roll back its blockchain to return the money to Bybit as well as prevent the North Korean government from weaponizing the looted ETH stash. “I fully support rolling back Ethereum’s chain (again) so the stolen ETH is returned to Bybit and also to prevent the North Korean government from using those funds to finance their nuclear weapons program. It’s not about what I want. It’s about what is best for the entire Ethereum ecosystem which I care deeply about. We cannot allow ETH to finance the North Korean nuclear program.” Blockchain rollbacks reverse transactions that have already been confirmed to restore the chain to a specified earlier state and are usually performed after a network undergoes a major security breach. In the case of ETH, a rollback will lead to a hard fork similar to in 2016 during the Ethereum DAO hack when thieves stole 3.6 million Ether. Mow goes on to joke that the new roll-backed chain should keep the ticker ETH while the current one could be renamed to “ETHNK,” noting that investors should think about refraining from trading ETH until things are figured out. “As Vitalik Buterin and I discuss the best way to roll back the Ethereum chain, it’s best for everyone to stop trading ETH. Given that the rolled-back chain will have the ticker ETH, it’s prudent to rename the current one to ETHNK, which I believe Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un will continue to run validators for. So we will now have: ETH (the real Ethereum), ETHNK (which Coinbase should delist immediately), [and] ETC (Ethereum Classic) Let’s get to work.” Ethereum is trading for $2,770 at time of writing, a 4% increase during the last day.

With Bitcoin and Ethereum already reaching mainstream adoption, the real opportunities now lie in emerging projects that bring something fresh to the table. Near Protocol and Cosmos are making waves by enhancing blockchain scalability and interoperability, attracting developers and enterprises alike. But the real disruptor in this space is Qubetics ($TICS), a next-gen Web3 aggregator tackling one of the biggest challenges in crypto—cross-chain connectivity. Unlike its predecessors, Qubetics is solving the fragmentation problem by uniting major blockchains under one ecosystem. Its cutting-edge infrastructure ensures seamless interoperability while offering an all-in-one, non-custodial wallet that lets users manage assets across multiple networks effortlessly. With its presale gaining rapid traction and a mainnet launch set for Q2 2025, early investors are eyeing massive gains. Could Qubetics be the biggest breakout of the year? Let’s dive into what makes it stand out alongside Near Protocol and Cosmos as the best cryptos with 1000X potential. Qubetics ($TICS): The Web3 Aggregator Poised for 1000X Growth One of Qubetics’ most impressive innovations is its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet. Unlike traditional wallets that force users to manage different blockchain addresses separately, Qubetics allows for easy asset transfers across networks while ensuring users maintain full control of their funds. A freelance developer, for example, can receive payments in Ethereum, store savings in Bitcoin, and invest in Solana-based projects—all from one secure wallet. This eliminates the need for multiple apps, making digital asset management simpler and more efficient. With such a revolutionary approach, Qubetics is solidifying its place among the best cryptos with 1000X potential for investors looking at long-term gains Partnership with 1inch: Enhancing Decentralized Trading Trading crypto assets efficiently often means manually searching for the best prices across multiple decentralized exchanges. Qubetics has eliminated this hassle by partnering with 1inch, a leading DEX aggregator. Through this integration, Qubetics users get access to the most competitive trading rates instantly. A crypto investor looking to swap large amounts of tokens no longer has to worry about slippage or poor rates—Qubetics automatically finds the best deal, optimizing every transaction. Collaboration with SWFT: Streamlining Cross-Chain Transactions Alongside its 1inch partnership, Qubetics has joined forces with SWFT, a cross-chain swap protocol that enables near-instant asset exchanges between different blockchains. This is a major breakthrough for businesses and individuals who frequently deal with multi-chain transactions. An international e-commerce store accepting crypto payments, for example, can instantly swap payments from different currencies into their preferred token, reducing conversion fees and transaction delays. Qubetics makes financial operations seamless, efficient, and cost-effective. Qubetics Presale: A Golden Opportunity Qubetics’ crypto presale is in its 22nd stage, with over $13.6 million raised and more than 484 million $TICS tokens sold. The current price per token is $0.08073, and with each presale stage lasting seven days, the price increases by 10% every Sunday at 12 AM. Investors who get in now secure a lower price before Qubetics enters the open market. With its rapid momentum and disruptive technology, Qubetics is positioning itself among the best cryptos with 1000X potential, drawing significant attention from early adopters. Analyst projections indicate that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, translating into a 209.67% ROI. If it jumps to $1 after the presale, early investors would see an astonishing 1138.69% ROI, while a post-mainnet surge to $10 could result in a jaw-dropping 12,286.96% ROI. The numbers speak for themselves, and those who recognize the opportunity now are positioning themselves for massive gains. A $750 investment at the current price of $0.08073 per $TICS would yield approximately 9,290 tokens. If $TICS reaches $1 after the presale, that investment would be worth $9,290. Should it climb to $10, the value would skyrocket to $92,902.27. With the mainnet launch set for Q2 2025, securing an early position in the best cryptos with 1000X potential like Qubetics could be one of the smartest moves for investors looking to capitalize on this next-gen blockchain project. Near Protocol: Simplifying Blockchain for Mass Adoption Near Protocol is making blockchain technology accessible to everyday users and developers by removing the barriers that have slowed mainstream adoption. Unlike older networks that require users to navigate complex interfaces and manage long, cryptic wallet addresses, Near offers a simplified experience similar to traditional web applications. This ease of use is making it a top choice for developers building decentralized applications (dApps). Beyond user-friendliness, Near is built for scalability. Its unique sharding mechanism allows it to process transactions quickly and cost-effectively, even under heavy network demand. Unlike Ethereum, which often struggles with congestion and high gas fees, Near distributes network load dynamically, ensuring fast and low-cost transactions. Recent ecosystem expansions have strengthened Near’s position in the market. The protocol has been actively integrating multi-chain capabilities, allowing developers to build dApps that function across multiple blockchains. With more partnerships and continued technological improvements, Near Protocol is cementing itself as a major player in the race for blockchain scalability. Cosmos: The Internet of Blockchains Cosmos is tackling one of the most significant challenges in crypto—interoperability. Most blockchains operate in isolation, making cross-chain transactions cumbersome and expensive. Cosmos solves this issue with its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, enabling different blockchains to interact seamlessly. This technology is crucial for creating a connected ecosystem where assets and data can move freely between chains. One of Cosmos’ standout features is its Cosmos SDK, a developer-friendly toolkit that allows projects to build custom blockchains tailored to their needs. Instead of forcing developers to conform to a single chain’s rules, Cosmos lets them create specialized blockchains optimized for specific applications. This flexibility has led to the rapid adoption of Cosmos technology across various crypto projects. Cosmos has been growing its network aggressively, with an increasing number of blockchains integrating its interoperability solutions. As the demand for seamless cross-chain communication rises, Cosmos is positioned to play a crucial role in shaping the future of blockchain connectivity. Conclusion The search for the best cryptos with 1000X potential leads to projects that solve real-world blockchain limitations while offering long-term growth. Near Protocol is simplifying blockchain for mainstream adoption with its developer-friendly, scalable network. Cosmos is spearheading blockchain interoperability, ensuring different chains can communicate effortlessly. Meanwhile, Qubetics is setting new standards with its multi-chain wallet, seamless trading integrations, and cross-chain swap partnerships. With its presale nearing its final stages and the potential for astronomical post-launch growth, there’s never been a better time to join the Qubetics presale before prices surge again.

In contrast, another market strategist suggested that SHIB’s current price movements are a part of a large Inverse Head and Shoulders structure, which could lead to a 400+% surge. Ali Martinez was on the bearish side, claiming that SHIB’s most recent price declines – a 4% drop in the past week and over 23% since this time last month – means that the asset had lost a key support level, which is situated somewhere between the $0.000019 and $0.00002 lines. The chart below demonstrates that Shiba Inu’s largest native token has remained at around that level for the past several months. It soared well above it on a couple of occasions since the summer of 2024, the last being after the US presidential elections, but has lost steam and recently dropped to its lowest price tag since September. Martinez warned that SHIB could face another leg down soon, which can take it south to $0.000011 or even $0.00008. Such violent declines would represent price drops of 30% and 50%. #ShibaInu $SHIB has lost a key support level!

Consequently, the strategist determined that Shiba Inu could go as high as $0.000081, which would be a 420% surge from its current price levels. $SHIB (Shiba Inu) prices maintaining the structure of a large Inverse Head & Shoulder and with the $0.000081 target still in play, an over 402% run to reach it could come out of this! https://t.co/WwgfDoTpcU pic.twitter.com/wuZ6c2yrlY — JAVON MARKS (@JavonTM1) February 22, 2025 The post Shiba Inu Price Forecasts: Another 50% Crash or 420% Rally Ahead for SHIB? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|SHIBBTC|SHIBUSD|Shiba Inu (SHIB),EN,0,0,SHIB|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-02-23 10:21:01

However, the viral project that has investors scrambling for early positioning is Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP). Currently in presale, the world’s only Bitcoin meme has stormed to over $3 million as ICO stages sell out quickly. Here’s what to know about Bitcoin Pepe and why it could be an interesting project to watch Bitcoin Pepe – the meme layer 2 for BTC While some see meme coin hype in action, Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is eyeing growth potential within a $75 billion meme market. This is what it looks like to do by tapping into the $2 trillion market of Bitcoin. It means “building Solana on Bitcoin”. Per the project’s whitepaper , the result is a meme layer 2 for BTC that merges the speed of Solana and Bitcoin’s security. Part of the huge interest in Bitcoin Pepe is down to the fact that meme coins skyrocketed past the $100 billion mark without BTC. Meanwhile, the world’s most popular digital asset currently sits at $2 trillion. It’s heights that see BTC rank above Meta, Saudi Aramco and Silver as the world’s 7th most valuable asset . Bitcoin Pepe benefits from BTC resilience and meme hype Recent meme coin ecosystem events, including the Libra debacle, have not helped the market. The same can be said of the $1.4 billion hack on Bybit by North Korea-backed Lazarus Group. However, as anyone who’s taken a keen look at the market can attest to, crypto is as resilient as ever. Indeed, bulls point to the market’s ability to bounce from similar incidents before. Ethereum rose slightly despite the hack. However, the most bullish sentiment is around Bitcoin, while meme coins have churned gems. Bitcoin, on the verge of nation-state adoption, and memes, crypto’s biggest adoption avenue, are a combination that comes alive via. Bitcoin Pepe. The project claims to build an ecosystem powered by the new PEP-20 standard. If the project delivers on milestones such as low transaction fees, bridge and DEX launch, it could help elevate meme coins to the next level. Bigger picture? BPEP could even eclipse DOGE, PEPE and SHIB. That’s if traction within the BTC ecosystem takes shape. BPEP presale hits $3 million milestone The Bitcoin Pepe ICO has raced through the first four stages, attracting significant attention. BPEP is now in stage 5, which is about to sell out. The project has raised over $3 million from early adopters, with the presale accelerating. A look at the market shows this is happening despite the slowdown that has BTC price consolidating below $100k, and Solana among other top altcoins struggling. It shows not only the interest the project has garnered but also notable market confidence in what lies ahead for BPEP. At $0.0255 in the current presale stage, Bitcoin Pepe offers what many will consider a bargain entry point. However, with the market known for its volatility and uncertainty, the good old mantra of DYOR is important. To learn more, visit the official Bitcoin Pepe page .

It is widely known that investing in early-stage start-ups in the sphere of cryptocurrency may be fundamentally quite risky but also potentially very profitable. Hence, if the product Ozak AI finds fame, this could see the price of the product rise as well. According to experts, it is still feasible to reach the goal of more than $1 if the project develops further. Ozak AI’s Performance in the Presale In terms of fundraising, Ozak AI received a lot of attention regarding its presale since it took a short amount of time to reach its goal. The project has attracted more than $900,000 in funding, which proves investors’ interest in the project's potential. Starting with the token price which was at $ $0.001 now it has soared to $0.003, more price rises will happen. This increased need for AI-supported blockchain solutions has created hopes of improved performance among Ozak AI as a firm. Thus, additional listings on exchanges and developments of AI technology set the project as a target for investors seeking the next big thing.

Experts Weigh In,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-mutuum-finance-mutm-set-to-repeat-xrps-success-experts-weigh-in/,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining momentum as investors look for the next high-growth crypto opportunity. With its decentralized lending model and structured financial ecosystem, some analysts are drawing comparisons to XRP’s early days when it surged in value due to its strong use case. Mutuum Finance provides real utility through crypto lending, borrowing, and passive income generation, making it an attractive option for those looking beyond market hype. As the presale nears completion, with over $1 million raised and 95% of Phase 1 tokens already sold, many believe MUTM has the potential to see exponential growth once it hits exchanges. Could Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Outperform XRP? Experts believe Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has the potential to match or even surpass XRP’s success. Unlike many altcoins that rely on speculation, Mutuum Finance is built around a structured financial model, offering real utility through decentralized lending. Its ecosystem allows users to supply and borrow assets while earning passive income, creating sustained demand for the token. Analysts suggest that with its strong fundamentals and growing investor base, MUTM will reach $1–$2 after launch, especially as exchange listings and platform expansion drive further adoption. One of the key factors driving this bullish outlook is Mutuum Finance’s buy-and-distribute mechanism, which ensures continuous buying pressure. A portion of platform revenue is allocated to repurchasing MUTM tokens from the market, which are then distributed to mtToken stakers. This model benefits long-term holders by rewarding participation while keeping supply in check. Combined with an overcollateralized stablecoin that enhances liquidity, Mutuum Finance is positioned as a sustainable and scalable DeFi solution—something XRP capitalized on in its early days. Mutuum Finance introduces mtTokens, a key component of its lending system, designed to reward users who supply assets to liquidity pools. When lenders deposit crypto into the platform, they receive mtTokens at a 1:1 ratio to their supplied assets—such as mtETH for Ethereum or mtDAI for DAI. These tokens automatically accrue interest over time, increasing their redemption value based on borrower repayments. Instead of adjusting the exchange rate, mtTokens grow in value, allowing lenders to earn passive income without actively managing their funds. When users choose to withdraw their assets, they redeem mtTokens for the underlying cryptocurrency, now including the accumulated interest.

40726026,https://zycrypto.com/?p=102665,1740306692,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,North Korean Lazarus Group Likely Behind $1.46 Billion Bybit Exchange Hack,https://zycrypto.com/north-korean-lazarus-group-likely-behind-1-46-billion-bybit-exchange-hack/,"With not all information public, Arkham Intelligence, a blockchain analysis firm, has concluded that North Korea’s Lazarus group was responsible for the $1.46 billion hack on the Bybit exchange. On platform X, Arkham offered a bounty of 50,000 ARKM tokens, worth around $30,000, for anyone who could identify the attackers responsible for Friday’s hack. Not long after, Arkham announced that freelancer ZachXBT had provided “definite proof” that the North Korean hacking group was behind the hack. According to current information, Lazarus, North Korea’s elite state-sponsored hacking group, pulled off the largest hack in history on a centralized crypto exchange. The hack resulted in the withdrawal of Ethereum tokens amounting to around $1.5 billion. Ethereum security researchers are scrambling to investigate the incident to understand how the attack happened and whether the hack may spread to other exchanges. Within days, crypto enthusiast ZachXBT identified the Lazarus group as the likely culprit. Lazarus has been responsible for many of the top attacks on digital assets. Blockchain firm Nansen revealed that the attackers first withdrew the funds into a single wallet and then distributed them to multiple wallets. “Initially, the stolen funds were transferred to a primary wallet, which then distributed them across more than 40 wallets”, Nansen said. “The attackers converted all stETH, cmETH, and mETH to ETH before systematically transferring ETH in $27 million increments to over 10 additional wallets”. Ben Zhou, Bybit CEO, urged customers to remain calm and assured them that 80% of funds were recovered by using bridge loans to replace the stolen money. Despite the current bank run on Bybit, Zhou assured users that withdrawals would not be blocked and that customers would have access to their funds. Leveraging bridge loans allows Zhou to honour withdrawal requests. At this stage, the return of stolen tokens is highly unlikely. ZachXBT has yet to release all data pointing to the Lazarus group. He says his analysis involved tracking online connections between wallet addresses until, with the assistance of a colleague, he was able to narrow down the suspects to the North Korean hacking group. ZachXBT found a connection between the wallets used in the Bybit hack and the wallets used in the $85 million hack of Singapore-based exchange Phemex. At this stage, at least, the attack appears to be caused by Blind Signing, in which the smart contact is approved without complete knowledge of its contents. “This attack vector is quickly becoming the favorite form of cyber attack used by advanced threat actors, including North Korea”, said Blockaid’s CEO Ido Ben Natan. “It’s the same type of attack that was used in the Radiant Capital breach and the WazirX incident.” “The problem is that even with the best key management solutions, today most of the signing process is delegated to software interfaces that interact with dApps.” “This creates a critical vulnerability- it opens the door for malicious manipulation of the signing process, which is exactly what happened in this attack,” he said. The stolen funds are unlikely to be returned because North Korea does not have an extradition agreement with the United States. The North Korean hacking group was able to attain more money in this single hack than in all of its hacks last year. This hack contrasts with other previous large-scale attacks, such as the 2016 Bitfinex hack, in that the people behind this attack will likely get away with it and will most likely keep the stolen money. This shows that the American justice system is limited to countries with extradition agreements. Although America focuses on retrieving lost funds through tax, there’s not much they can do about large-scale hacks. Tom Robinson, Elliptic’s chief scientist, described the attack as the “largest crypto theft of all time.” “The next largest crypto theft would be the $611 million stolen from Poly Network in 2021. In fact it may even be the largest single theft of all time”. Bybit appears to be processing withdrawals just fine after their hack,” wrote Coinbase executive Conor Grogan. They have $20B+ in assets on the platform, and their cold wallets are untouched. “Given the isolated nature of the signing hack and how well capitalized Bybit is, I don’t expect there to be contagion.” “A minute into the FTX bankrun it was clear they had no funds to withdraw. I know everyone has PTSD but Bybit is not an FTX situation, if it was I would be screaming it out. They will be fine”. The Lazarus group’s history can be traced back to 2017 when they hacked South Korean exchanges and stole over $200 million in Bitcoin. Crypto bank robberies seem to be here to stay and will need to be a major focus within the crypto industry.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|North Korea,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|ARKM|ASIA|ETH|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-23 10:31:32

Don’t Miss Ozak AI in 2025!,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/missed-bitcoin-in-2013-dont-miss-ozak-ai-in-2025,"For those who lived through the exceptional Bitcoin boom in 2013, the feelings would be something that seems to be hard to forget. At one time, Bitcoin was just $100, and today, it is worth easily tens of thousands. Do not let this repeat in history. Ozak AI is the next big thing, and you may rewrite your destiny in 2025. Not just another cryptocurrency, Ozak AI is a highly revolutionary AI-powered ecosystem that promises to redefine whole industries. From healthcare to finance, Ozak AI would integrate people to transform the interaction with technology. The project has already caused headaches in its wake with the crazy presale success. The Presale Success of Ozak AI The presale of Ozak AI has proved nothing short of phenomenal as it raised over $900,000 in a matter of days. Investors have a flock of reasons why this project was so. Ongoing presale stage 3 is offering tokens for $0.003, about an increase of 200% from stage 1, where tokens went out for just $0.001. Even though experts say the $OZ token will hit $1 before the end of 2025 with a listing price of $0.05, reflecting a 50,000% ROI from its initial price. The speed and width of this development reflect all the investor confidence in Ozak AI. Momentum is building for the project, and these lucky few are reaping the benefits today. But it is just the start. Why you can’t miss OZAK AI Ozak AI is beyond a token; it means a lot of things in movements. The team got real-life solutions from AI through their work with their eyes focused on such recommendations. Here's why you can't miss out: Potential for Explosive Growth: Presale stages are always seen to progress in tangible growth. The token price increases in every other stage. Early investors are already tending to realize high returns from their investments. Ozak AI is the name on everyone's lips, and this could run its value through the roof. Real-world Applications: Ozak AI goes beyond the mumbo-jumbo. The AI-built solutions come to a point whereby they tackle real issues. So, AI solutions reduce costs and enhance efficiency and decision-making across different domains. By this, practical utility transforms it into value in the long run. Active Community Support: The Ozak AI community is exploding with rapid growth. This project is bringing together developers and enthusiasts to invest with other investors. Strong support is the strong base for any cryptocurrency; with Ozak AI, it is robust. Supply-Limited, High-Demand: Limited supply will create a shortage of the Ozak AI token, which will shoot up its demand. Act Now or Regret Later The Ozak AI presale is the ground floor entry. It is still early in the project stages, but it already has all the signs of being the next big thing. You better act before it's too late. At one time, Bitcoin was the underdog, but those who trusted it early received rewards that changed their lives. Ozak AI has the same potential that could transform lives for those who got in on the opportunity early. By 2025, there could be another story of success that people wish they had been part of.

Much like Bitcoin's surge from $100 to tens of thousands, revolutionary projects often await recognition. Ozak AI is set to be one such opportunity, a breakthrough in AI integration across various sectors. This innovative platform is gaining remarkable traction, reminiscent of the early days of cryptocurrency miracles. A Wave of Enthusiasm: Ozak AI's Phenomenal Presale In just a matter of days, the presale phase of Ozak AI accumulated an astonishing $900,000, showcasing immense investor faith. Currently, in its third presale stage, the Ozak AI presale continues to thrive, with token prices escalating from $0.001 to $0.003. As predictions suggest a potential rise to $1 by 2025, the project's momentum only intensifies, sparking a sense of urgency among potential investors. Why Ozak AI Stands Out The excitement surrounding Ozak AI is not just hype; it's backed by tangible benefits and innovations. Explosion of Growth Potential: With each presale stage, token values are climbing, marking significant returns for initial investors. The buzz surrounding Ozak AI is palpable, reflecting the soaring demand. Real-World Impact: Ozak AI is not limited to theoretical applications; it aims to revolutionize how we engage with AI to solve pressing real-world problems, enhancing decision-making and operational efficiency. Robust Community Engagement: Ozak AI's ever-expanding community is a testament to its strong foundation. Bringing together developers and enthusiasts, this support network is integral to the project's resilience. Demand Driven by Scarcity: The limited availability of Ozak AI tokens ensures increased demand, setting the stage for potential value appreciation. Seize the Moment or Risk Missing Out Remember the early Bitcoin adopters who reaped unimaginable rewards? Ozak AI could mirror that success story, providing life-altering returns to early supporters. Don't let history repeat itself; recognize the promise of Ozak AI before it becomes a missed opportunity.

Its real-world utilities and impressive presale achievements mark it as a promising addition to any portfolio. Opt in now to potentially transform your future, much like the early Bitcoin pioneers.

Is this firestorm being ignited by RXS? RXS is comparable to Solana (SOL), among the most popular and fast-expanding cryptocurrencies. RXS has seen its value explode as the comparison gathers traction; many analysts believe this is merely the start of an incredible climb to popularity. Solana’s Influence and Market Performance Sol has shown market supremacy over the last two years by consistently ranking among the top six cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Solana's leading blockchain network has distinguished itself for rapid transactions, minimal costs, and high developer engagement. It gives investors notable profits. Driven by a robust bull market, Solana topped all previous marks in late 2024. Later on, though, it was corrected when gains were taken. Solana is still a popular blockchain for Web3 developments, NFT markets, and DeFi apps, notwithstanding this. Solana Trade Chart Feb 7, 2025 | Source: Trading View Solana started the year at $189, and when 2025 started, its price was under a bearish influence. But by the middle of January, a positive attitude reappeared, driving SOL up 7% on daily charts and 6% on weekly charts. This comeback has generated enthusiasm for blockchain initiatives with like traits, particularly Rexas Finance (RXS). Rexas Finance (RXS): The Explosive Token on a Parabolic Rise The increasing analogy between Solana (SOL) and Rexas Finance (RXS) is based on actual technological and market-driven parallels, not only a marketing tactic. Similar to Solana, Rexas Finance aims to facilitate swift, cost-effective transactions. While Solana concentrates on DeFi and Web3, Rexas Finance works on real estate tokenization—a trillion-dollar sector. Solana and Rexas Finance have fast-expanding communities, developer interest, and institutional support. Many investors view SOL as the next breakthrough, especially considering its modest presale price and strong utility case; it shot from under $2 to an all-time high of $260. Given growing demand, several analysts think Rexas Finance might follow a similar exponential development path and should be a top investment for 2025. Click Here To Buy Rexas Finance (RXS) Presale Rexas Finance (RXS) is a next-generation blockchain platform designed to transform decentralized finance (DeFi) and tokenize actual assets, especially real estate. With its state-of-the-art technology, Rexas Finance allows consumers to tokenize real-world assets, enabling tradeable blockchain access to once-illiquid markets. This practical application of RXS in real estate tokenization reassures investors of its utility and potential. Given the value of the $280 trillion global real estate market, Rexas Finance presents an opportunity to inject new liquidity into the sector. This is significant because it means that Rexas Finance, by providing real-world value—a distinction from many speculative cryptocurrencies—could potentially revolutionize the real estate industry, making it more accessible and liquid for investors. Rexas Finance is currently in its final presale stage, and the results are impressive. It has raised over $45.4 million, with over 447.3 million tokens sold at a presale price of $0.20 each. This reflects great investor demand and demonstrates that Rexas Finance is not just another hype-driven coin but a real competitor in the crypto market. The current stage is 89.46% filled, indicating strong investor interest in the project. Once the official exchange date was determined, the buzz about Rexas Finance grew unprecedentedly. Starting June 19, 2025, the RXS token will first appear on the main cryptocurrency exchanges at a listing price of $0.25. For presale investors, this offers a 25% immediate profit, which increases project interest even more. This means that even before the token is officially listed, investors already see returns on their investment, which is a strong indicator of the project's potential. With its strong presale demand and strategic exchange listings, Rexas Finance is well-positioned for continuous development and is among the most anticipated altcoins in 2025. Its listing on three Tier 1 exchanges will significantly increase its global visibility and liquidity. These high-profile exchange listings often increase trading volume, increasing the token's price as more investors gain access, instilling confidence in its future growth. While most new and upcoming projects falter regarding credibility, Rexas Finance has already achieved key milestones. Being tracked on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko makes it easy for investors to check the milestones achieved by Rexas Finance. Moreover, Certik, one of the best-known blockchain security companies, has audited Rexas Finance's smart contracts. These milestones increase investors' trust in Rexas Finance , validating the company’s claim that Rexas Finance is a highly speculative altcoin and that it is, in fact, an extremely reliable utility-based project. Conclusion Rexas Finance's (RXS) recent parabolic climb is not random. With its strong foundations, great demand, and practical application of the project, Rexas Finance is poised to be a major competitor in the blockchain field. The analogy to Solana (SOL) has only stoked more enthusiasm, elevating Rexas Finance as one of the most exciting altcoins in 2025. With a $0.20 presale price, a confirmed June 19 exchange launch, and strong investor backing, Rexas Finance (RXS) presents a promising opportunity for those seeking the next Solana-like prospect.

The Solana Effect on Emerging Cryptocurrencies Solana has established itself as a powerhouse in the crypto market with impressive market capitalisation and a robust blockchain network, noted for its rapid transaction speeds and low fees. Its success set a standard for emerging platforms like Rexas Finance, which aims to deliver similar technological prowess. Solana's journey has inspired a plethora of blockchain projects, cementing its status as a go-to blockchain for developing Web3, NFT, and DeFi solutions.

This resurgence in confidence has fueled interest in new projects with similar potential, like Rexas Finance. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Rising Star with Unique Offerings What distinguishes Rexas Finance from others is its mission to disrupt the trillion-dollar real estate market through blockchain technology. By allowing assets to be tokenized, RXS aims to inject liquidity and accessibility into traditionally illiquid markets. This unique focus draws a comparison with Solana's technological advancement, albeit in a different sector. Such parallels intrigue investors who missed Solana’s initial rise. Rexas Finance's approach to real estate tokenization is transforming how investments are made, providing a solid foundation for growth. With its strategic presale, this emerging altcoin is gaining considerable investor interest, raising over $45.4 million with millions of tokens already sold.

Tim Beiko: “Bybit Hack Was Not Caused by a Bug Inside Ethereum, Unlike What We Saw with TheDAO” However, Ethereum developer Tim Beiko stated that such a reversal is not possible and could have serious consequences for the stability and integrity of the network. Following the attack, some crypto commentators questioned whether Ethereum could implement a rollback process similar to past incidents like the infamous TheDAO attack in 2016. However, Beiko explained that the two cases are fundamentally different. Unlike the TheDAO hack, which involved a vulnerability in a smart contract implementation built on Ethereum, the Bybit hack did not involve any violations of Ethereum’s protocol rules. Instead, the attack exploited weaknesses in Bybit’s multisig interface to enable unauthorized fund transfers. Beiko noted that in 2016, TheDAO funds were frozen for a month, allowing the Ethereum community to coordinate and implement a “non-discretionary state change” to recover the funds. In response, the Bybit hacker was able to move the funds immediately, making any tampering nearly impossible. Additionally, the Ethereum ecosystem has evolved significantly since 2016, with decentralized finance (DeFi) and cross-chain bridges creating a highly interconnected environment where reversing transactions could cause unwanted disruptions. Related News: Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao Talks About the Fate of a Large Amount of Tokens He Was Given as a Gift: Burn or Sell? Involves 15 Altcoins To explain the concept of rollbacks, Beiko highlighted a historical case from Bitcoin’s early years. In 2010, a bug in Bitcoin’s code led to the accidental minting of 184 billion BTC. Satoshi Nakamoto quickly issued a fix, and since Bitcoin’s adoption and mining difficulty were still relatively low, the community welcomed a rollback. Ethereum also faced a buyback with TheDAO in 2016, which led to a split in the community and the creation of Ethereum Classic (ETC). Since then, proposals for similar interventions, such as EIP-999, which aimed to recover funds frozen by the Parity wallet bug in 2018, have faced strong opposition. The Ethereum community has largely distanced itself from such interventions in order to maintain the immutability of the network and avoid setting dangerous precedents. Bybit CEO Ben acknowledged the seriousness of the hack, but emphasized that the stolen funds only amounted to 0.3% to 0.4% of Ethereum’s total supply, far less than TheDAO’s 30% during the network rollback. Given this, it’s unlikely Ethereum will consider a rollback. However, Bybit is actively seeking guidance from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin on possible solutions. *This is not investment advice.

With Bitcoin’s projected surge toward $120,000, many feel the next bull run will generate exceptional profits on smaller, undervalued coins. Among them, three altcoins have emerged as standout options with the potential to yield gains as high as 3500%: Rexas Finance (RXS), Movement (MOVE), and Jupiter (JUP). Each project offers distinct qualities and new solutions that set them apart in a crowded market. Bitcoin’s Upcoming Surge and the Altcoin Opportunity Bitcoin is up 0.44% and currently trading at $97839. This evolution follows President Donald Trump's announcement via executive order establishing a national digital asset stockpile. BTC has excellent prospects of reaching $120K before 2025 ends. Although many anticipated a Bitcoin reserve, the president adopted a generalist approach, suggesting the US acquire other cryptocurrencies. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Platform for Real-World Utility Rexas Finance (RXS), trading at an accessible price of $0.20 during its last presale stage, which is already 89.48% filled, is drawing attention for its rich ecosystem and practical applications. Built on the Ethereum network, RXS is not simply another speculative token but an integrated platform enabling token generation and project launches. The ecosystem provides tools that let businesses and developers generate unique tokens, launch new initiatives, and tap into the booming Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization market. This functionality allows tangible assets, including real estate and commodities, to be digitized and traded on the blockchain, opening up a multi-trillion-dollar market that traditional cryptocurrencies have yet to explore fully. Reflecting great investor confidence, Rexas Finance has already raised over $45.4 during its presale. The project’s upcoming launch on June 19, 2025, with a listing price of $0.25, marks a critical juncture where its value could experience a dramatic surge. Its combination of creative technology and practical applications allows exponential gains, attracting investors seeking early-stage positions in a project with strong foundations. Click Here To Buy Rexas Finance (RXS) Presale Movement (MOVE): Redefining Blockchain Efficiency With a market cap of $1.46 billion, MOVE is currently trading at $0.62. The trading volume of Movement has surged by 77.80% throughout the past twenty-four hours. February 9th, March 9th, April 9th, May 9th, June 9th, and July 9th, 2025 are upcoming token unlocking dates planned. These unlocks might affect the token's price. As the project grows, early investors could get large profits, establishing MOVE as a possible leader in the next bull run. Its creative approach to addressing real-world blockchain infrastructure difficulties could provide significant benefits, particularly with more established but slower-growing platforms. Jupiter (JUP): Optimizing Liquidity in the DeFi Ecosystem With a market worth $2.22 billion and trading at $0.84, Jupiter's trading volume has climbed by 4.50% in the last 24 hours. Whale activity has lately increased; big holders moved around $943 million in JUP in 24 hours. The project's creative approach to addressing liquidity issues in distributed markets is expected to drive its value much higher, supporting the greater momentum of altcoin gains in the forthcoming bull run. Capturing the Next Wave of Altcoin Gains With Bitcoin's optimistic future poised to bring in a new market expansion phase, the focus is moving to highly potential altcoins. Rexas Finance (RXS), Movement (MOVE), and Jupiter (JUP) capture a different aspect of the new crypto scene. With RWA tokenization and a strong platform for token creation and blockchain innovation, Rexas Finance distinguishes itself for its complete ecosystem and practical value. Through its modular design and scalable solutions addressing long-standing industry challenges, Movement (MOVE) is poised to redefine blockchain efficiency. Jupiter is improving liquidity in the DeFi area. Hence, it is a key actor in the Solana ecosystem. These three projects should be part of a diversified altcoins approach for investors wishing to multiply their portfolios before Bitcoin reaches its expected $120,000 high. If these initiatives can gather momentum for the next bull run, the possibility of gains as high as 3500% is not only a dream but also a reasonable target. Early-stage investment in these tokens could translate into substantial returns, making them some of the best cheap altcoin opportunities. Final Thoughts As the market sets up for another significant surge, the chance to gain early positions in high-potential altcoins is opening up. With Bitcoin about to reach new heights, the subsequent liquidity and investor enthusiasm are anticipated to drive exponential growth in ventures like Rexas Finance , Movement, and Jupiter. For those who missed the early Bitcoin or Ethereum rallies, this could be the chance to diversify and reap life-changing profits in the coming months. The key to enormous returns depends on discovering these possibilities early, and for intelligent investors, the time to act is now.

However, it has rebounded hard in the past 24 hours following strong speculation that it will be listed by the world’s largest crypto exchange. After years and years of development, rumors, delays, and speculations, Pi Network finally released its Open Network and native token for trading on February 20. Although the project was in beta version for nearly half a decade, its community grew strong, and interest in it shot up. Somewhat expected, the debut of the PI token was followed by an immediate price crash as the asset was listed on several big-name exchanges, such as Bitget, OKX, and MEXC. It went from almost $1.9 to around $0.6 within hours before it staged a comeback in the past 24 hours. In fact, the asset has added more than 66% on a daily scale and now sits close to $1.45 after peaking at $1.62 earlier today. PI Token Price. Source: CoinGecko Its market capitalization has not been verified by the two largest data aggregators – CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap – but both show that the trading volumes have exploded by 180% since yesterday. Perhaps the most probable reason behind the increase in volume and prices came from Binance. The crypto giant recently held a community vote to determine whether its users would want to see the PI token available for trading on its platform. Although the results will become official on February 27, the interim numbers are quite overwhelming. As of now, 85% of all voters have clicked ‘yes,’ which spurred speculation from the Pi Network team that the listing is inevitable. Such rumors tend to accelerate the price increases of crypto assets even before they become reality, which is typically followed by a correction, just like it happened after Pi Network’s launch this week.

However, Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko has firmly rejected the idea, warning that such a move would be technically impractical and highly disruptive. On X, Beiko explained that the situation is far more complex than it seems to outsiders. While some crypto commentators believe a rollback could restore Bybit’s stolen funds , he clarified that Ethereum’s current infrastructure is far more advanced than in past incidents like The DAO hack of 2016, making such a reversal virtually impossible without severe consequences. Bybit Hack Different from DAO Hack Comparisons between the Bybit exploit and the infamous DAO hack in 2016 have been circulating, but Beiko was quick to point out key differences. In the DAO case, the attacker exploited a flaw in the smart contract governing the DAO, and because withdrawals were temporarily frozen, Ethereum developers had time to intervene before the stolen funds were moved. That event led to an emergency Ethereum hard fork, creating Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). However, the Bybit hack was fundamentally different. The attackers used a compromised wallet interface that made transactions appear legitimate while malicious code redirected the funds. Unlike in 2016, the exploiter instantly transferred and moved ETH through on-chain transactions. “This was not a protocol-level failure,” Beiko explained. “The transactions followed Ethereum’s rules, making a rollback extremely complicated.” Ethereum educator Anthony Sassano agreed, saying in a Feb. 22 X post, “That’s not how any of this works, and it’s not even how it worked with The DAO hack.” Ripple Effects Could Be Catastrophic Beiko stressed that reversing the hack wouldn’t just erase the stolen funds—it would undo all Ethereum transactions from that point forward, affecting DeFi protocols, NFT transfers, exchange sales, and real-world asset settlements. Yuga Labs’ Blockchain VP, known as 0xQuit, warned that the fallout from a rollback would be far greater than the $1.5 billion loss itself. “Thousands of innocent people would lose money, thousands more would gain money they shouldn’t,” Quit noted. “Ethereum is now the backbone of DeFi and cross-chain settlements—you can’t just rewind that kind of infrastructure.” Despite the pushback from developers, some high-profile industry figures have supported a rollback. Jan3 CEO Samson Mow suggested that reversing the hack would not only recover Bybit’s funds but also prevent North Korea’s Lazarus Group from using the stolen ETH to finance weapons programs. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes even tagged Vitalik Buterin in a post urging him to support a chain rollback. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou stated in an X Spaces discussion that the decision should be up to the Ethereum community rather than a single entity or individual.

For example, the Aptos forecast predicts a potential rise to approximately $12 by mid-2025, although this is dependent on general market dynamics. Likewise, Aave price analysis indicates a potential rise, provided it can breach the $275 resistance level. BlockDAG (BDAG) , however, is positioning itself strongly, having already amassed over $197.3 million in its current presale. Through its unique Affiliate Program, which offers a 5% USDT cashback reward and a passive income model for traders, BlockDAG presents an enticing option for early participants. As BlockDAG gears up for listing on 10 exchanges soon, its affiliate program offers a prime opportunity for both newcomers and existing users to earn significant rewards. Aptos Forecast: Charting the Journey to $12 and Above Aptos has recently seen its price surge, ranking it among the major gainers on CoinMarketCap amid overall market volatility. Reflecting on its history, Aptos debuted in late 2022, quickly surpassing $100 before seeing a steep drop. Efforts to reclaim these peak levels have since been unsuccessful. The latest price increase seems tied to a wave of market optimism and a rebound from previous lows. The Aptos forecast anticipates a price point near $12 by the second quarter of 2025, assuming current trends persist. This estimate is cautiously made, considering the scarcity of significant new developments, with the recent addition of native USDC being a notable event. Aave Price Analysis: Navigating Through Price Adjustments Aave price analysis points to a potential upward trend following a period of price adjustments. Analysis of longer time frames suggests that AAVE may have completed a corrective wave pattern and could be poised for a new ascent. Aave price analysis on shorter time frames indicates the beginnings of a five-wave structure, potentially heralding a breakout. AAVE had previously peaked close to $400 before undergoing a correction and finding a support base near $236. Aave price analysis illustrates the asset rebounding from this support level, typically an early sign of a potential reversal. The price is now challenging resistance, and surpassing key levels, especially near $275, would confirm a bullish scenario. Conversely, failure to maintain support above $236 could indicate an ongoing correction. Understanding BlockDAG’s Referral Benefits BlockDAG is capturing significant attention with its presale, which has successfully raised over $197.3 million and issued more than 18.5 billion coins. Currently at Batch 27, the BDAG price is at $0.0248, marking a remarkable rise of 2380%. This impressive growth underscores the escalating interest in BlockDAG, particularly among those searching for the best crypto to buy now. A key component of this surge is BlockDAG’s Affiliate Program, crafted to incentivize both new buyers and current holders who help grow the BlockDAG network. The initiative provides a two-fold advantage: a direct 5% USDT cashback (for both the person referring and the referred) on every transaction made through a referral link. This method serves as an effective way to earn passive income for those who promote BDAG by distributing their unique affiliate link to contacts. Each purchase made via their link during the presale earns the promoter a 5% commission in USDT BEP-20, enabling them to gradually build up rewards while aiding in BlockDAG’s community growth. Looking forward, the anticipated next step for BlockDAG, which might involve being listed on several exchanges, could play a crucial role in enhancing its valuation. Typically, such listings boost a cryptocurrency’s visibility and ease of access, which may further spur demand and increase its price. Now presents a prime opportunity to engage with BlockDAG’s presale, benefiting from the affiliate program’s immediate cashback and potential long-term gains as BDAG’s value possibly escalates. Final Thoughts While the Aptos forecast indicates potential for growth, its prospects are closely linked to the overall market movements. In the same vein, Aave’s price analysis suggests a rise is possible, yet it depends on breaking through crucial resistance levels. Meanwhile, BlockDAG stands out with its current presale, having amassed considerable funds already. Additionally, the distinctive Affiliate Program, which offers a 5% USDT cashback and a means for passive income, positions BlockDAG as an attractive choice for those in search of the best crypto to buy now . With potential exchange listings on the horizon, BlockDAG’s presale might be the final chance to access substantial benefits. The narrowing window for the affiliate cashback program underscores the immediacy for those aiming to maximize their returns.

At the same time, a newly emerging competitor, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), has captured market interest with an initial price of $0.01. The project has already secured over $1 million and more than 2,280 investors in its first presale phase, which is 98% sold out. Once this phase concludes, the token’s cost is slated to jump by 50% to $0.015, spurring investors to seize the lowest entry while it lasts. As Solana strives to recapture momentum, many observers see Mutuum Finance as a more compelling choice with better upside potential. Solana (SOL) Battles Below $200: Will It Recover?

Analysts tie the slump partly to fading hype surrounding certain ecosystem tokens and the reverberations from the LIBRA crash. While still hosting a vibrant developer community, Solana’s future price trajectory likely hinges on restoring investor confidence. If this does not happen, forecasts project a drop to around $144. Facing stiff competition in the market, some Solana holders are now scouting for tokens offering faster growth and greater resilience. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates Investors looking for more dynamic gains are turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi project focused on practical lending solutions. In its presale phase, the project has raised over $1,075,544, with 98% of the Phase 1 tokens sold at $0.01 apiece. The token’s price will rise to $0.015 in Phase 2 and eventually to $0.06 at launch, granting early adopters potential 600% returns even before public trading commences. Designed for sustainable tokenomics, Mutuum Finance operates as a fully decentralized, non-custodial platform, letting users maintain control of their assets. It employs a dual-lending approach—Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P)—to accommodate diverse financial strategies. The P2C model leverages liquidity pools with adjustable interest rates, while the P2P framework eliminates intermediaries, empowering borrowers and lenders to set terms directly. This innovation aims to transform the DeFi lending landscape. Both lenders and borrowers can opt for variable or fixed interest rates managed by smart contracts. To keep everything secure, Mutuum Finance is undergoing thorough external audits, and its codebase is open-source, encouraging transparency. Community Incentives and Long-Term Vision To boost adoption, Mutuum Finance plans a $100,000 giveaway, with ten winners each receiving $10,000 in MUTM tokens. A referral program also rewards users for bringing new investors aboard, cultivating an engaged, expanding community. As Solana’s price hovers below $200 and struggles to regain its earlier highs, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as an appealing alternative, fueled by growing presale momentum and a forward-looking roadmap. With Phase 1 nearly sold out and the price set to jump 50% in Phase 2, early buyers stand to benefit from Mutuum Finance’s advanced DeFi features. For those searching for high-growth opportunities, snapping up MUTM tokens now could prove strategic before the market spotlight fully shifts to this rising contender.

40728067,https://cryptonews.com/?p=335334,1740309433,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/40728067.jpeg,Mantra Price Pumped 100% This Month: $15 on the Horizon?,https://cryptonews.com/news/mantra-price-pumped-100-this-month-15-on-the-horizon/,"MANTRA (OM) has surged 100% this month, currently trading at $8.58 with a 24-hour trading volume of $609.6 million. MANTRA has obtained a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license from Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), allowing it to operate as a Virtual Asset Exchange and provide Broker-Dealer, Management, and Investment Services. This regulatory approval strengthens MANTRA’s position as a compliant player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, enhancing its credibility and investor confidence. The move into Dubai, a hub for digital asset innovation, strategically positions MANTRA to introduce a range of regulated DeFi products tailored to meet the evolving needs of global investors. As digital finance grows, regulatory compliance is becoming crucial for investor trust and market adoption. This license not only bolsters MANTRA’s legal standing but also sets the stage for its continued growth in the Middle East and beyond. Technical Analysis: Will MANTRA Break Above $9.59? MANTRA is attempting to break above the crucial resistance level at $9.59, which could trigger further bullish momentum towards $10.07 and $10.84. However, failure to clear $9.59 may result in a pullback to the immediate support at $8.43. The ascending channel pattern indicates a bullish continuation as long as prices remain above the $8.43 pivot point. Additionally, the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $7.45 is acting as dynamic support, reinforcing the bullish sentiment. Key Resistance Levels: Immediate Resistance: $9.59 – A breakout above this level could target $10.07 and $10.84. Next Resistance: $10.07 and $10.84 – Clearing these levels could push MANTRA towards $12 and beyond. Key Support Levels: Immediate Support: $8.43 – A drop below this level could lead to further declines. Next Support: $7.77 and $7.13 – Critical zones to watch if selling pressure intensifies. The bullish trend remains intact above $8.43, supported by the ascending channel pattern. However, a break below this level could trigger a bearish reversal, testing support at $7.77 or even $7.13. Can MANTRA Hit $15? Key Drivers and Outlook With a market cap of $8.35 billion and increasing trading volume, MANTRA is gaining traction among investors. The Dubai VASP license and RWAccelerator launch are key drivers fueling bullish sentiment. Additionally, the expansion into the Middle East aligns with MANTRA’s long-term growth strategy, leveraging Dubai’s forward-thinking regulatory landscape. The global tokenization market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 19%, reaching $5.6 billion by 2026. By leading the RWA tokenization movement, MANTRA is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. Moreover, Google Cloud’s support in the RWAccelerator program adds credibility and innovation potential. However, volatility remains high, and investors should watch the $9.59 resistance and $8.43 support levels closely. A decisive breakout above $9.59 could pave the way for a rally towards $15. Conversely, failure to maintain momentum above $8.43 may trigger consolidation or a bearish reversal. Key Insights: Bullish Momentum Above $8.43: The ascending channel pattern supports bullish continuation if prices remain above $8.43. Breakout Potential at $9.59: A breakout above $9.59 could push MANTRA towards $10.07 and $10.84. Dubai Expansion Boost: VASP license and RWAccelerator launch enhance MANTRA’s regulatory compliance and growth prospects. As MANTRA continues its upward trajectory, the $15 mark is within reach, supported by strong technical indicators and strategic growth initiatives. However, traders should monitor resistance and support levels for potential breakout or reversal signals.

While both projects have solidified their positions in the DeFi sector, recent price trends and developments suggest investors are exploring a new DeFi competitor. This new DeFi competitor is already shaping up to be the 2025 DeFi star. It offers innovative solutions and trading rewards that could outperform traditional market leaders. Read on for more on this new market player and how it compares to LINK and HYPE! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Chainlink Struggles Despite Strong Network Growth Chainlink has been a constant in the crypto space, providing secure Oracle services for smart contracts. However, in the past month, LINK’s price has dropped 18%. The Chainlink token now trades at $19.24 . Despite integrations with several Layer 2 solutions , the token price is still behind the times, emphasizing the need for caution. Chainlink has focused on improving staking mechanisms and expanding real-world data integrations. While this has strengthened its long-term use case, short-term token price action has been underwhelming. Analysts believe that breaking its current resistance will initiate a bull run, but more market momentum is needed for LINK. Institutional acceptance has also been key in the LINK ecosystem as major financial organizations have adopted Chainlink’s data feeds . Even so, there has not been strong retail support for the LINK price activity. Chainlink investors are now considering newer DeFi coins that provide more immediate profit opportunities. Hyperliquid Sees Mixed Sentiment Among Investors Hyperliquid, a decentralized perpetual trading platform, has gained traction for its innovative approach to derivatives trading. Trading at $25.43 , HYPE’s price has risen over 23% in the last month, driven by rising trading volumes and platform developments. The token has, however, faced resistance at some level, limiting a strong breakout. Hyperliquid’s newer venture into AI-powered trading tools has attracted institutional attention, though retail investors remain cautious. The introduction of zero-slippage order execution has positioned Hyperliquid as a strong competitor in the DeFi space, yet HYPE’s price remains volatile. HYPE has been facing regulatory uncertainty surrounding decentralized derivatives. As global regulators crack down on high-leverage trading, investors assess whether Hyperliquid’s HYPE will maintain its long-term viability. Many are investing in emerging DeFi platforms that balance innovation and regulatory compliance. Why is FXGuys Emerging as the Best Crypto Trading Platform? With Chainlink and Hyperliquid showing mixed price action, a new DeFi competitor, FXGuys ($FXG), is gaining momentum. This new prop firm redefines crypto trading by providing access to up to $500,000 in trader funding. Thus, you can scale your positions without risking excessive personal capital. You can also earn rewards through the FX Guys Trade2Earn program, receiving $FXG tokens for every trade you execute—a feature missing in most traditional DeFi platforms. That’s not all! Unlike LINK and HYPE, which rely on long-term adoption to see price growth, this new competitor offers instant staking rewards. You can secure up to a 20% APY by staking your tokens on the FXGuys platform. Another major advantage is the instant payout system, which allows you to withdraw profits without waiting. This feature makes it stand out against DeFi platforms that often impose withdrawal restrictions or long settlement periods. In addition, FXGuys has launched its BETA trading platform, allowing early investors to experience its features before the official launch. This hands-on access has helped build confidence in the project, making it a top contender for the best crypto trading platform against established DeFi giants. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Is $FXG 2025’s DeFi Coin Star? While Chainlink and Hyperliquid continue to develop, investors are looking for projects with faster growth potential. FXGuys is proving to be a powerful alternative, combining trader-friendly features with massive upside potential. Currently, in its Stage 3 public presale, the token is valued at $0.05. The FXGuys presale has already raised over $4 million, and its next stage price is set at $0.06. Due to its growing demand, Stage 3 is 80% complete. Once $FXG launches on multiple exchanges at $0.10, Stage 3 investors will grab a massive 100% ROI. With a launch price slated for $0.10, early investors who got in at the Seed Funding Round price of $0.01 expect a 900% profit. For those looking to capitalize on the next big DeFi coin, $FXG might just be the best cryptocurrency investment option of 2025. The presale supply is running out fast. Get in now!

XRP and Solana’s Explosive Growth Signals a Bull Run XRP has been on a tear, fueled by its growing adoption in cross-border payments. Trading at $2.70, XRP has gained over 30% year-to-date and shows no signs of slowing. Solana (SOL), known for its blazing-fast transactions, is currently priced at $177.67. With NFT adoption and DeFi projects booming on its blockchain, SOL’s growth remains strong. While these cryptos are pumping, the biggest gains come from early-stage investments—where 1000x opportunities exist. DOT, KAS, and APT: Good Plays, But Limited Gains? Polkadot (DOT): Trading at $8.79, DOT is solid but isn’t delivering the massive breakouts investors crave. Kaspa (KAS): At $0.10, KAS has upside, but its gains have slowed compared to other fast-growing projects. Aptos (APT): Currently $6.36, APT has strong tech but lacks the hype to drive 1000x returns.

As cryptocurrencies continue to grow in popularity and attract a whole new generation of investors, traders must keep up with the pace of development to ensure that they won’t suddenly find themselves with an obsolete trading solution that’s lost its magic touch. With this promising crypto forecast in mind, the main question that many crypto traders have been asking themselves is how they can ensure that their automated crypto trading bots can successfully deal with whatever the future brings. To answer this question, an excellent place to start is by asking ourselves what features and abilities we expect to be most crucial for success later on. After pondering the last sentence, artificial intelligence likely popped into many of your minds. While there is much anticipation and excitement around the topic, you should focus your efforts elsewhere. For now, this technology is out of reach, and most experts agree that there is still plenty of time before entirely autonomous AI-driven crypto trading will be a viable option available to the general public. With that said, the future of automated crypto trading is by no means reliant on just this one technology. Good crypto trading bots with a wide range of advanced features are already available to help us traders secure our financial future. To begin with, some automated trading tools give us traders the same reliable yet hassle-free approach towards buying and selling cryptos in the way that AI is expected to deliver in the coming years. These crypto bots, most commonly known as signals or expert-copy bots, allow you to automatically copy trades and positions of renowned trading experts with extreme precision. Setting up a signals trading scheme might take a while if done with accuracy in mind. For it to be successful, traders must conduct thorough due diligence on the different signal providers before choosing the ones that satisfy their preferences. If you are taking notes, your most significant takeaway should be to start exploring signal channels for trading alerts and the overall design of your trading strategies and signals bot to ensure smooth execution. If you find your signals to be too dangerous or conservative to your liking, you always have the option to adjust them according to your personal risk tolerance. Next, consider narrowing down your range of options only to those likely the most relevant to future market conditions to best prepare for the future. The safest choices would be crypto trading bots designed for exploiting rising markets, volatile markets, or both. Like before, try to focus on highly customizable trading solutions that enable traders to adjust their strategies according to their specific needs. For bullish trends, dollar-cost-averaging crypto trading bots, or DCA bots, are popular among crypto traders at all levels. Its very intuitive approach entails cashing in on short-term trades during upswings while avoiding any price correction that may occur occasionally. If you are bullish about the long-term potential of a specific crypto, then setting up a DCA bot to trade it efficiently is an option worth considering. Regarding volatile markets that lack a clear direction, grid bots are considered an excellent tool to capitalize on ranging markets through fast-paced trades with an elaborate set-up of numerous trades, each with its distinct entry and exit plan. In many cases, an ongoing price appreciation is accompanied by increased volatility. Therefore, grid bots are likely to be even more relevant in the future than they are now. As a last piece of advice, remember that tomorrow is technically the future, and there is no better time to prepare for it than today.

As cryptocurrency captures the interest of diverse investor groups, having the ability to adapt to ongoing changes ensures one's trading tools remain effective. Considering this dynamic environment, a key consideration for traders is how their crypto trading bots can adapt to future market transformations. Understanding the core elements that will shape future trading success is the first step. While artificial intelligence often comes to mind, it's important to recognize that this technology, although promising, is not yet accessible for widespread, fully autonomous crypto trading. Current advancements in automated trading don't solely rely on AI. Existing bots with sophisticated features are well-equipped to help traders achieve their financial objectives. One aspect worth highlighting is the innovation of automated systems that mimic the anticipated benefits of AI. These systems, such as signals or expert-copy bots, facilitate seamless trade replication from accomplished experts, offering precision without the complexity. However, establishing a signals trading strategy requires meticulous selection of signal providers to ensure alignment with individual trader goals. Exploring various signal channels for effective alerts and strategy design is crucial. Adjustments can always be made to reflect personal risk appetites if required. When preparing for future markets, prioritize versatile options relevant to upcoming trends. Bots adept at navigating both rising and volatile markets will remain valuable. Tailored solutions that allow strategic customization for unique trading goals are crucial for forward planning. In bullish scenarios, dollar-cost-averaging bots, also known as DCA bots, are favoured for their ability to profit from short-term price increases while sidestepping possible corrections. Setting up a DCA bot for preferred cryptocurrencies can be a wise move for optimistic traders. For uncertain, choppy markets, grid bots are ideal for leveraging rapid price changes with intricate trade setups. Given the link between increasing prices and volatility, these bots are poised to remain vital tools in the crypto landscape. Finally, remember that future preparedness begins today. Aligning current strategies with tomorrow's possibilities ensures readiness for any market shifts. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

The discussion, titled “Together Against Industry Crisis, Is There a Best Solution for the Security of the Crypto Industry?” featured insights from leading security firms SlowMist and GoPlus Security, as well as prominent KOLs. Security: A Top Priority for HTX Sun stressed that security is a “top priority”, demanding constant vigilance and learning. He illustrated how hacker tactics have evolved, from early hot wallet attacks to more sophisticated multi-signature wallet breaches, and declared that exchanges must continuously enhance their security protocol. Sun emphasized that security is like personal health management, requiring internal efforts and a proactive approach. HTX has implemented multi-device login, remote login alerts, abnormal transfer alerts, and other security features, and has publicly disclosed Merkle Tree Proof of Reserve (PoR) for 28 consecutive months, maintaining reserve ratios exceeding 100%. Sun’s Influence on Security Practices Across the Crypto Landscape Sun’s commitment to security extends to his vision for HTX and his influential role in shaping security practices across the broader crypto landscape. He believes that the principle of security is considered fundamental to every business and product. He cited the early implementation of native multi-signature functionality in TRON as a successful example of proactive security design, demonstrating his commitment to building security into the foundation of his projects. He also highlighted the recent launch of USDD 2.0, emphasizing the deep understanding of stablecoin security risks that informed its development. “Just as exchanges should strengthen security mechanisms from the source in system design and operation, to maximize the prevention of security incidents,” Sun stated. Sun also revealed that HTX collaborates with numerous white hat teams to conduct continuous penetration testing, security drills, and vulnerability mining. The platform actively monitors global cryptocurrency security incidents and studies hacker attack principles and methods for effective prevention.

Somnia , a cost-efficient EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain, has announced the launch of the Shannon Testnet , as it prepares for the upcoming mainnet launch. The blockchain, which aims to offer faster transaction speeds and higher scalability, will offer Web 3 users a real-world testing ground for their next-generation platform, starting today. The Shannon Testnet is named after Claude Elwood Shannon, the father of information theory, and will offer a testing ground for users to build applications on a high-speed, scalable and cost-efficient platform. In addition, the Testnet also introduces new features and innovations to make development more efficient on the platform. Some of the innovations include the MultiStream consensus, advanced compression techniques and sequential execution. The launch of the Shannon Testnet follows a successful DevNet performance, with the Somnia blockchain recording 1 million+ transactions per second (TPS), showing its capability to finalize huge volume transactions. Moreover, the DevNet also achieved sub-second finality and ultra-low transaction fees, proving its ability to handle real-world demand. The Shannon Testnet aims to improve the blockchain through rigorous testing by users and developers. It is designed to test congestion resistance and give developers the infrastructure to deploy applications at high scalability to millions of users. Shannon is designed to simulate real-world conditions, ensuring blockchain applications can function at a mass scale. Shannon Testnet Introduces New Innovations and Features As alluded to, Somnia will be bringing massive changes to the Shannon Testnet, introducing powerful groundbreaking innovations. The Testnet will be powered by several technologies, including the MultiSream consensus, sequential execution, deterministic databases, and advanced compression techniques. The MultiStream consensus aims to provide the backbone of high-performance scalability on the blockchain. This consensus revolutionizes blockchain scalability, allowing parallel execution of transactions without network slowdowns. This model enables each validator to be responsible for adding data to its chain without needing consensus checks at the individual level. Instead of a universal chain, these individual data chains function separately, while a “consensus chain” brings them together. This allows the chain to offer sub-second finality, high TPS and sub-cent transaction fees. “Shannon Testnet is the proving ground for a fully on-chain future. With 1M+ TPS, sub-second finality, and MultiStream Consensus, developers can build without limits, and millions of users can experience blockchain at true internet scale,” Somnia founder Paul Thomas said. Other additional innovations include accelerated sequential execution, which converts EVM bytecode into highly optimized native code, delivering single-core performance without runtime interpretation bottlenecks. Also, Shannon Testnet introduces the IceDB, a custom-built blockchain database that provides nanosecond-level read/write speeds, ensuring consistent transaction finalization and accurate gas fee estimation. Finally, developers on Shannon will also enjoy advanced compression techniques, reducing the bandwidth requirements through streaming compression algorithms, enabling scalability for millions of transactions per second. These innovations aim to offer developers a robust, fast, scalable and cost-effective environment to build next-generation blockchain applications. Unlocking A New Era For Blockchain Development The Shannon Testnet will enable several users to enjoy greater decentralization as multiple third-party validators join the network and staking protocols go live. This is expected to enhance the robustness of the network and enhance security and resilience. Secondly, the blockchain will remove state wipes, allowing developers to build confidently without the need to redeploy or replay the state. This ensures a more reliable and predictable environment for developers. Also, Shannon Testnet enhances developer readiness by providing the necessary infrastructure and toolkits to build and test applications. As the Testnet gains momentum, the team believes it will spark ecosystem growth as projects onboard to the blockchain, driving up real adoption rates and testing activity. This will unlock new real-world use cases across Somnia including reactive applications (DApps that instantly respond to on-chain events and real-world data), fully on-chain gaming (games with real-time mechanics, instant transactions, and decentralized economies), scalable DeFi protocols, and social platforms and metaverses. Looking Forward Somnia’s Testnet is fully equipped with the infrastructure that developers need to build and scale their applications. Apart from the next-gen features and innovations, the testnet also integrated key infrastructure partners, ensuring seamless development and deployment. With the upcoming robust ecosystem in place, developers can immediately start building without needing to wait for additional integrations. According to the team, the Shannon Testnet launch is the next step towards the mainnet launch – expected later this year. Over the coming months, the Testnet will welcome developers to deploy applications, optimize performance, and stress-test the network, while Somnia continues refining its infrastructure for full-scale adoption.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-02-23 11:55:44

DevNet success has underscored the efficacy of the Somnia blockchain, achieving a throughput of over a million transactions per second, with unprecedented transaction finality and minimal costs. These advances highlight Somnia's readiness to tackle large-scale, real-world application demands. Innovative Features Transforming the Shannon Testnet Somnia is reshaping blockchain capabilities with Shannon’s innovative features. At the heart of its transformation is the MultiStream consensus model, along with key technological upgrades like sequential execution and advanced compression methods. The MultiStream consensus stands as a groundbreaking approach, propelling the blockchain's scalability by enabling the simultaneous processing of transactions. This innovation eliminates traditional bottlenecks, allowing each validator to manage its data independently while a unified consensus chain orchestrates the network. “Shannon Testnet is the proving ground for a fully on-chain future. With 1M+ TPS, sub-second finality, and MultiStream Consensus, developers can build without limits, and millions of users can experience blockchain at true internet scale,” Somnia founder Paul Thomas said. Moreover, the Testnet introduces accelerated sequential execution that maximizes performance by converting bytecode to optimized native code, enhancing single-core output without typical bottlenecks. The introduction of IceDB, a custom database, promises swift read/write operations, ensuring seamless transaction processing and precise fee calculations. These advancements are complemented by novel compression techniques that drastically reduce bandwidth needs, paving the way for a truly scalable environment capable of handling millions of transactions.

40728836,https://bitzo.com/2025/02/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-settles-around-96000-after-bybit-shock,1740311897,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/40728836.jpeg,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Settles Around $96,000 After Bybit Shock",https://bitzo.com/2025/02/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-settles-around-96000-after-bybit-shock,"Bitcoin (BTC) has steadied itself between $96,000 and $96,500 following a substantial decline after Bybit, one of the most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges, was hacked for a staggering $1.4 billion. The flagship cryptocurrency has registered a marginal increase over the past 24 hours and is trading at $96,390. BTC has been range-bound for weeks. However, spot Bitcoin ETFs have continued to attract inflows. ETFs have attracted inflows of $4.3 billion in Q1 2025, compared to $4.8 billion in Q1 2024. Is BTC’s Dip A Chance For Retail Investors? Bitcoin (BTC) has registered a sharp correction since hitting its all-time high on January 20. However, the flagship cryptocurrency could not sustain momentum, ultimately dropping below $100,000 as it tested key support levels. BTC is currently trading 12% lower than its all-time high. BTC’s drop has retail traders wondering if they should buy the dip or wait for a deeper correction. BTC has entered a consolidation phase after its impressive post-election rally. Analysts believe the current price action indicates a pause before the next leg of the bull rally. Edu Patel, Founder and CEO of Mudrex, stated, “While macroeconomic data and rising tariffs have caused short-term volatility, promising new developments in regulation and adoption, such as the SEC’s crypto task force and new ETFs awaiting approval, signal there could be a lot of steam left in this bull run.” According to Patel, retail investors must take advantage of this current consolidation phase and buy the dip. “With Bitcoin holding strong at key support levels, market pullbacks offer opportunities for dollar-cost averaging.” However, not everyone is convinced this is the right time to enter the market. According to Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, investors must conduct their research and assess their risk tolerance before making any moves in the market. “The current market conditions are marked by volatility and driven by macroeconomic factors and regulatory uncertainties. While some may view this dip as a buying opportunity, investors must conduct thorough research and assess their risk tolerance before making any decisions.” Amit Malik, President of JAPA (Japan, Asia Pacific, and Australia) at Wadzpay, warned retail investors against making impulsive decisions. “Historically, buying the dip has proven profitable for fundamentally strong cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which tend to rebound after corrections. However, prices could fall further due to regulatory changes or macroeconomic events.” Can A Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Pay Off US Debt By 2049? VanEck has released a tool that assesses the potential impact of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve under specific conditions. The tool allows the government to set the number of Bitcoins purchased annually, the average price at which they are being bought, and the average compound growth rate of the BTC price and US debt. The tool is based on VanEck research outlining how soon the debt could be offset by the reserve at the specified parameters. The research assumes the Bitcoin Act will be adopted this year. The research assumes the US Treasury will collect a million Bitcoins in five years and hold them for 20 years, with the assets only being spent to cover the national debt. VanEck’s research concludes the US will amass 1 million BTC by 2049, with their total value amounting to $21 trillion, which would offset around 18% of the national debt, which is expected to reach $116 trillion by 2029. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) could be approaching a decisive moment, with a potential breakdown of key support levels after weakening buying pressure. According to one analysis, BTC’s support zone at $93,000 has been tested multiple times since BTC began trading in its consolidation range. The analysis states that multiple retests could have weakened the support zone, and buyers could be overwhelmed. The latest retest of BTC’s support level occurred on February 18, when BTC dropped to an intraday low of $93,430 before recovering. With buying pressure fading, the likelihood of a drop below this level has increased. A break below this level could lead to a deeper correction and lead BTC to drop below $80,000. BTC’s next significant level of support sits at $72,000. However, BTC has not shifted into a fully bearish mode, with current price action suggesting indecision. This means it could resolve either way. If BTC dips below $93,000 and then $90,000, it could lead to a deeper correction. On the other hand, if buyers gain momentum, BTC could push above $100,000. However, BTC is struggling to build momentum, with sellers controlling the ongoing session. BTC needs significant buying and selling pressure to break out of range. However, there is no catalyst to dictate price action, with the fallout from the Bybit hack largely contained. BTC started the week in the red after dropping 1.51% on Sunday. Sellers retained control on Monday, with the price falling below $96,000 to settle at $95,767. Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as BTC plunged to an intraday low of $93,430. However, it recovered from this level to reclaim $95,000 and settle at $95,643, ultimately registering a marginal drop. Sentiment changed on Wednesday as buyers returned to the market, and BTC rose nearly 1% to reclaim $96,000 and settle at $96,386. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC registered an increase of almost 2% and settled at $98,251, with analysts expecting a move towards $100,000. Source: TradingView That expectation changed on Friday following the Bybit hack that sent shockwaves in the market, with prices tanking. As a result, BTC faced significant volatility and fell to an intraday low of $94,829 before settling at $96,184, a drop of just over 2%. Saturday saw a marginal recovery as BTC rose to $96,478. However, the price fell back during the current session, down 0.53%, and trading at $95,659. If buyers cannot retake control, the MACD, currently bullish, could flip to bearish. Meanwhile, the RSI is just below the neutral zone, indicating a bearish bias. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The market reacted sharply to the news of Bybit’s $1.4 billion hack, causing widespread fear and uncertainty. Prices across the crypto market, including Cardano, dropped from local highs, testing critical support levels. ADA fell over 7% on Friday as panic-driven selling took hold, but the market has since stabilized as Bybit reassured investors with a strong response. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Serious Price Compression – What Happened Last Time Despite the short-term volatility, analysts remain optimistic about ADA’s next move. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that Cardano remains in a consolidation phase and is setting up for a potential 25% price move. Historically, consolidation at key demand levels has led to strong breakouts, and if ADA maintains support above its current range, a bullish move could follow. Investors are closely watching the price action as ADA continues to trade within a tight range. If bullish momentum builds, a breakout could send Cardano toward higher supply zones, confirming a new upward trend. However, if market sentiment weakens, a deeper retrace into lower demand levels may occur. The next few days will be crucial in determining Cardano’s short-term direction. Cardano Holds Key Demand Amid Uncertainty Cardano is holding above key demand levels amid recent uncertainty and fear triggered by Bybit’s hack. The event shook the market, causing a wave of selling pressure that pushed most altcoins, including ADA, into low demand levels. The extreme selling pressure that began in late December remains a concern for investors, as volatility continues to dominate price action. Despite this, ADA has managed to maintain its position above critical support zones, fueling speculation about a possible recovery. Bulls are growing increasingly cautious as ADA struggles to reclaim key supply levels. Many investors remain hopeful that the current consolidation phase will lead to a breakout. Martinez’s analysis on X suggests that Cardano remains in consolidation and could be setting up for a potential 25% price move. Historically, periods of extended consolidation at major support levels have led to explosive rallies, and ADA’s current positioning could indicate a major move is on the horizon. If Cardano successfully reclaims key supply levels and pushes above resistance zones, a massive recovery rally could follow, propelling prices toward multi-month highs. However, losing its current demand zone could trigger a significant correction, further extending ADA’s downward trend. The next few days will be crucial in determining the direction of Cardano’s price action. Related Reading: Cardano Must Hold Critical Support Around $0.67 To Sustain Bull Run – Details ADA Prepares For A Move Cardano (ADA) is trading at $0.76 after failing to reclaim the $0.82 mark for the second time. The price has been struggling to gain momentum, with selling pressure keeping it below key resistance levels. Bulls need to push above $0.82 and hold it as support to establish a foundation for higher prices. If ADA successfully reclaims this level, the next key target is $0.85, which aligns with the 4-hour 200 moving average, a critical indicator for short-term strength and momentum. For ADA to confirm a bullish recovery, buyers must defend the $0.73 level over the coming days. Holding above this level will demonstrate strength and allow the price to build a base for a potential rally. However, if Cardano fails to hold above $0.73, further downside could be expected, with the risk of a drop into lower demand zones. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Key Support – Analyst Doubts Bears Can Defend $4K Anymore Investors remain cautious as ADA continues to trade within a tight range, and a breakout in either direction could set the stage for the next major move.

On Feb. 21, the exchange lost over 439,000 ETH along with liquid-staked tokens like Mantle Staked ETH (mETH) in an exploit that shocked the crypto industry. However, data from CryptoQuant shows that Bybit’s ETH reserves have bounced back to 201,600 ETH, up from the post-hack low of just 61,000 ETH. A significant portion of this recovery came from spot purchases, with Bybit acquiring over 106,498 ETH worth approximately $295 million in over-the-counter (OTC) trades, according to blockchain intelligence firm Lookonchain. Crypto Exchanges and Whales Step In Bybit’s rapid recovery wasn’t just due to its own efforts—major players across the industry stepped up. Several crypto exchanges and whales provided emergency liquidity to the embattled platform, demonstrating a rare show of solidarity in a fiercely competitive market. According to Lookonchain, Bybit received: 50,000 ETH from Binance 40,000 ETH from Bitget 10,000 ETH from Du Jun, co-founder of HTX Group $390 million worth of Ether in loans and deposits, including $127 million from Binance-based whales Despite the staggering scale of the attack, Bybit’s ability to process 350,000 withdrawal requests within 10 hours— completing 99.9% of them—helped reassure its users and prevent a liquidity crisis. Investigators Trace Attack to Lazarus Group As Bybit works to rebuild its reserves, blockchain security experts have been working to unravel how the attack happened. Analysts, including Arkham Intelligence and onchain sleuth ZachXBT, have linked the breach to North Korea’s Lazarus Group—a notorious hacking syndicate responsible for the $600 million Ronin network hack and several other high-profile crypto thefts. According to Meir Dolev, CTO of Cyvers, the attack bears similarities to past exploits, including those targeting WazirX ($230M) and Radiant Capital ($58M). The hackers reportedly used a deceptive transaction to trick Bybit’s signers into unknowingly approving a malicious smart contract change, effectively granting them control over the exchange’s multisig cold wallet. Despite the blow, Bybit’s proof-of-reserves auditor, Hacken, confirmed that user funds remain fully backed, reinforcing confidence in the platform’s solvency. While the full impact of the attack is still unfolding, Bybit’s rapid recovery marks a crucial test of resilience for both the exchange and the broader crypto ecosystem.

While the sector has been seen as a place where community-led initiatives thrive, there have been questions surrounding the limits of decentralization that it needs. The debate is coming at a time when popular sensation Kanye West is planning to launch his token called Swasticoin. The controversial figure announced the launch of the token amid several controversial posts on the blogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter). Kanye West’s recent statements included several antisemitic remarks targeting the Jewish community, triggering criticism and marking a shift from his criticism of celebrities who prey on their followers by launching rug pull tokens. Kanye West’s Swasticoin token triggers troubling trends On Saturday, Kanye West made a post suggesting that he was launching a token that he said was open to friends, family, and the Jewish people. “I’m going to open the CA [contract address] for my Swasticoin to Jewish people and my friends and family first,” Kanye West said. Alongside the announcement, he mentioned that he was trying to contact former Binance founder Changpeng Zhao as he seeks guidance on blockchain networks. The post sparked outrage on social media, unearthing a troubling trend that most people have ignored in the crypto industry for a long time. While Kanye West’s proposition might look like a standalone case, it is not isolated. In the past year, there has been an influx of racist and offensive tokens that have launched in the crypto market. The wave of these launches has spurred debates on the need for moderation in the decentralized space. Some of these tokens use racial slurs or offensive imagery to go viral and attract people who want to make money regardless of what the project represents. For instance, a month ago, an individual created the “Hitler Musk” token on Pump.fun. The token was created after Tesla billionaire Elon Musk did the one-arm straight salute at the inauguration of United States President Donald Trump. While Musk has played down the impact of the arm raise, observers have tagged it as a Nazi salute. Before then, a token called “HITLER” was created in 2021, appearing on exchanges before being delisted. Despite the offensive nature of these tokens and calls for developers to stop creating these tokens, it looks like the decentralized nature of blockchain will continually be exploited. While Kanye West’s token, which could be named YZY instead of Swasticoin can be used to evade restrictions on his Yeezy store on Shopify, there are reports that he plans to keep 70% of the token’s supply, fuelling speculation that he is concerned about the financial gain. While there are limited movements on the outside, there is a consensus that he is cooking up something behind the scenes. However, it is unclear if his token launch will take place next week as he has suggested on X. However, his latest “Time to launch my own blockchain” post on X shows that he is seriously considering the possibility. Regulators urged to address the rise of extreme coins As the racist and other offensive tokens continue to increase, there have been moves taken in the crypto industry to curb the trend. Users have also urged regulators to do something about the surge, noting that they could mandate platforms to screen tokens before they are listed. Also, Solana Foundation’s head of strategy, Austin Federa has suggested that there could be some sort of in-app filtering to reduce the tokens. According to Federa, this move will help applications and decentralized platforms screen out these types of tokens using either their imagery or names. However, there are still challenges due to the system being decentralized. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has also discussed the rise of these kinds of tokens, calling on the crypto community to come up with high-quality projects. In March 2024, Buterin mentioned the disturbing trend of growing speculative tokens, noting that most provide only short-term hype with little utility. He talked about some meme coins on Solana, noting that they were openly racist, something that he has condemned.

This has highlighted a recently launched crypto token, FloppyPepe (FPPE) . Considering its powerful AI technology and unique market value, crypto experts have predicted that it could become a top-performing digital asset in 2025. This has led the token to gain more traction and attract the attention of other crypto experts, investors, and whales. Why Crypto Experts Have Positive Predictions For FloppyPepe (FPPE) Despite being new in the crypto space, FloppyPepe (FPPE) has started prompting predictions from crypto experts and influencers. After its launch, it gained a SolidProof audit. This audit confirms security and confidence, indicating investors’ trust in the token. Then, the token recorded a rapid $902,700 sell-out in its private sale in merely twenty-four hours. These projections are fueled by the token’s combination of perfect market timing and technological integration. Following its presale launch, a prominent crypto influencer, NASS CRYPTO , who has a large subscriber base of over one million, described FloppyPepe (FPPE) as an “AI gem with potential for massive gains.” This prediction reflects the growing confidence in the long-term potential of FloppyPepe (FPPE). AI Technology: The Driving Force Behind FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Rise The powerful integration of AI technology in its tenets is what sets FloppyPepe (FPPE ) apart. It is more than just a meme coin. It is at the forefront of the booming AI crypto sector, making it a viable project and a possible top performer in 2025. FloppyPepe (FPPE) stands out for its AI technology tools and top-notch features. The first of these tools is the Meme-o-Matic tool, which works as a text-to-image generator. This tool uses artificial intelligence to create digital artworks and memes with massive potential to go viral. Having studied past and current social media trends, the tool can produce images that are of tangible quality for users and investors. Content creators and digital marketers can sell these images for extra profit. It also acts as a means of projecting FloppyPepe (FPPE) at the forefront of social media trends. Taking the initiative from the fact that short-form video content is currently dominating the online space, FloppyPepe (FPPE) also works with an AI video agent. This tool creates engaging short-form content that fits perfectly into the social media trend around that time. It equally contributes to maintaining the social media momentum of the meme coin while being a creative prompt for content creators and digital marketers. These features have blurred the line between entertainment and technology. This single action has projected the FloppyPepe (FPPE) token as dynamic and cutting-edge in the crypto space. Hence, crypto experts have remained in business, predicting that this token is very viable, promising over 5,000% gains for early investors. These crypto experts' predictions have been more encouraging of early investments for two reasons. The token has a unique stage-based pricing model that increases the price from its current $0.0000002 as it moves through different stages of its sale. There is also the token burn mechanism, which gradually reduces the token supply by 1% for every transaction it records. This reduces the supply of the token as the demand increases, resulting in a surge in its value. Conclusion With expert predictions, a sold-out private sale, and proof of inventive AI technological tools, FloppyPepe (FPPE) has every potential to grow up the ranks to become 2025’s hottest cryptocurrency. With the AI crypto sector booming, it has a unique value that gives it room for growth compared to other cryptocurrencies. Crypto experts have predicted, and crypto whales are already positioning themselves. Investors are quickly taking the chance to secure FloppyPepe (FPPE) before the next big price pump.

These AI-driven tools elevate FloppyPepe's status in the market, promising substantial returns for early adopters and reinforcing its image as an innovative crypto entity. The buzz around FloppyPepe is also fueled by its unique pricing model, where the token's value rises as it progresses through different sale stages.

40731842,https://cryptonews.com/?p=335345,1740314578,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/40731842.jpeg,Analysis: Will Bitcoin Price Hold at $95K Resistance or Is Rally Ahead?,https://cryptonews.com/news/analysis-will-bitcoin-price-hold-at-95k-resistance-or-is-rally-ahead/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is trading around $96,000, down nearly 1% in the past 24 hours, with a trading volume of $15.55 billion. The cryptocurrency is struggling to break above the $97,000 resistance level, which aligns with the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). This level is crucial for determining Bitcoin’s next move, as a breakout could trigger a bullish rally, while a rejection may lead to a pullback. Whale activity is painting an interesting picture. Data reveals that large Bitcoin holders ramped up their buying in mid-February, with inflows increasing from 100.77 BTC to 7,460 BTC by February 20. Outflows also peaked mid-month but have since dropped to 920.64 BTC, signaling reduced selling pressure. The disparity between inflows and outflows suggests aggressive accumulation by whales, which is typically a bullish indicator. This accumulation phase is happening amid Bitcoin’s price consolidation, reflecting market indecision. If Bitcoin can clear the $97,000 resistance, it could target the next resistance at $98,500, followed by the psychological $100,000 level. Conversely, failure to break above $97,000 may trigger a pullback to immediate support at $95,000, potentially leading to a retest of $93,500 or even $92,000. M2 Money Supply Rise Could Boost Bitcoin Liquidity The global M2 money supply is increasing, signaling higher market liquidity. This is crucial for Bitcoin, as more liquidity often leads to increased investment in digital assets. Analysts believe Bitcoin could mirror this upward trend, especially if central banks adopt looser monetary policies. Investors are watching for potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. If this happens, it could inject more liquidity into financial markets, possibly boosting Bitcoin’s price. Historically, Bitcoin performs well in high-liquidity environments, attracting both institutional and retail investors. However, market sentiment remains cautious. Bitcoin ETFs are showing negative flows, and exchange activity is at multi-year lows, reflecting regulatory uncertainties and economic pressures. Despite this, large holders are accumulating Bitcoin, hinting at optimism for a bullish reversal once sentiment shifts. Key Insights: Rising M2 money supply boosts liquidity, favorable for Bitcoin. Cautious market sentiment due to regulatory and economic concerns. Whale accumulation suggests potential bullish reversal. Technical Analysis: Will Bitcoin Break $97,000? Bitcoin is currently testing the $97,000 resistance level, which coincides with the 50-Day EMA, acting as dynamic resistance. A successful breakout above this level could push Bitcoin towards the next resistance at $98,500 and potentially $100,000. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering near 50, indicating market indecision. On the downside, immediate support is at $95,000, with the next support levels at $93,500 and $92,000. A break below $95,000 could intensify selling pressure, potentially driving Bitcoin towards $93,500. The bearish momentum would be confirmed if BTC falls below $92,000, negating the bullish outlook. #Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Will BTC Break $97,000?

The bullish sentiment remains intact as long as Bitcoin holds above the $95,000 pivot point Key Insights: Resistance at $97,000: The 50-Day EMA is acting as dynamic resistance. A breakout above this level could target $98,500 and $100,000. Support at $95,000: A drop below $95,000 could lead to further declines towards $93,500 and $92,000.

In a new interview with CNBC, Lee says in the face of tariffs and political uncertainty, markets still appear to be climbing a wall of worry, or the tendency for assets to ascend higher despite otherwise negative sentiment. “What really stands out to us is that the market has alluded extended periods of weakness because investors are bearish at the highs at the time when there’s record cash on the sidelines. So to us, this is a market that is very skeptical of these new highs. That bearishness and the concerns about tariffs means there’s a wall of worry so I think this is actually a very positive setup for stocks.” Regardless of recent volatility and the perceived riskiness, the seasoned investor says that growth stocks will continue to outperform this year and that the latest market correction will most likely be shallow and shortlived. “Investors really want to own stocks that actually have structural advantages, and that’s best evidenced by revenue growth, margin expansion, earnings growth and reasonable prices so the reason growth stocks will still outperform is that in a period like this, if we have macro uncertainty, they’re going to be names with some visibility. It’s not pleasant to own a growth stock today, but we know the lesson of 2025 is that these pullbacks have not been deep and investors have been buying these dips, so I don’t think today is any different. In fact, it’s no different than the DeepSeek panic, or the tariff-day panic, or the CPI (consumer price index) panic so I think this is going to be a buying opportunity.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

On the weekly chart, XRP has oscillated between $2.40 and $2.90, forming a symmetrical triangle pattern , a setup that often precedes a notable breakout, according to prominent cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez in an X post on February 23. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali_charts As per Martinez’s analysis, this formation indicates that XRP has the potential to rally by 14%. However, it is worth noting that symmetrical triangles suggest a breakout could go either way, meaning XRP can surge higher or face a temporary dip before finding support . In this context, the Ripple native token faces key resistance around $2.90, which could spark a bullish run. Support at $2.50 may provide a cushion for further consolidation. XRP hits the exhaustion zone Similarly, uncertainty regarding XRP’s next move was shared by cryptocurrency trading expert Michaël Poppe. In an X post on February 22, Poppe acknowledged that after XRP skyrocketed 500% in just four weeks, reaching $3.30, the digital currency might be showing signs of exhaustion and a possible cooldown. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Based on recent price movement and technical setup, Poppe suggested $1.50 to $2.25 as the next key accumulation zone, where long-term investors may find the best opportunities to buy the dip. After three years of low volatility, XRP’s breakout was fueled by a surge in trading volume. Poppe believes most of the upside has already been captured, and consolidation is likely before another leg up. “My best guess is that most of the upside is captured already and only the laggards are buying in at these levels. My second best guess is that we’ll consolidate before we continue to go up, which probably takes time. In that sense, you still want to be buying the dip if you’re interested in this one,” Poppe said. To recap, XRP experienced massive price growth following Donald Trump’s election, as optimism grew regarding a potentially favorable regulatory environment. Indeed, the extended consolidation of XRP below $1 was partly due to the ongoing legal case between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Now, with a new administration in place, there is speculation that the SEC might dismiss the case or push for a favorable settlement. Despite the suppressed price movement, whale investors have shown confidence in XRP through continued accumulation. On-chain data from cryptocurrency analysis platform Santiment highlighted this trend. According to data from the entity shared by Martinez on February 19, large investors accumulated 150 million XRP in 48 hours. Notably, such moves have historically been followed by price breakouts.

According to the tool, which leverages several AI models, XRP will likely gain about 7%, trading at an average price of $2.76 on March 1. Among the models, Claude 3 Opus has the highest forecast at $2.79, while ChatGPT-4o , ChatGPT-4o Mini, and DeepSeek Chat have set a target of $2.75. The generally bullish outlook is based on the asset’s technical indicators and positive momentum signals. Finbold AI XRP price prediction. Source: Finbold XRP price analysis As of press time, XRP was trading at $2.57, down about 0.7% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, XRP had plunged over 7%. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold XRP remains in a consolidation phase at the current price as it hovers below the 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $2.68. This suggests the asset is neither strongly bullish nor bearish. The 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) is 50.87, indicating a neutral market stance with no immediate signs of overbought or oversold conditions. For XRP to regain bullish momentum, it needs to reclaim $2.68, which could pave the way for further upside. The 200-day SMA at $1.43 presents a key long-term support level. If the price moves lower, the $1.50 and $2.25 range could be an ideal accumulation zone for investors anticipating another rally.

(Ethereum Price Analysis),https://cryptopotato.com/will-weak-momentum-drive-eth-to-2-5k-ethereum-price-analysis/,"Ethereum’s price action has been volatile in recent weeks, but the asset encountered a significant resistance zone. With strong selling pressure likely at this level, a rejection followed by a short-term decline appears probable. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart ETH recently found support at the critical $2.5K level and has since jumped toward the $3K region, revisiting the previously broken trendline of the descending wedge. However, this upward movement appears to lack momentum, resembling a pullback rather than a sustained recovery. Notably, the $3K region coincides with the 200-day moving average, reinforcing it as a strong resistance level where significant selling pressure may emerge. Given this confluence, the likelihood of rejection is high, potentially leading to another bearish move. If sellers regain control, Ethereum could decline further, with the $2.5K level remaining the primary downside target in the mid-term. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, ETH’s recent bullish retracement is evident as the price inches closer to a key resistance zone. This area includes the lower boundary of the previously broken wedge and aligns with the 0.5 ($2.7K) and 0.618 ($2.9K) Fibonacci retracement levels—both of which historically act as strong resistance zones. With selling pressure likely concentrated within this range and bullish momentum appearing weak, Ethereum may struggle to break higher. If rejection occurs, the price could reverse toward the $2.5K support level, where a critical supply zone awaits. Onchain Analysis By Shayan The recent Bybit hack has raised concerns among market participants about its potential impact on price trends. A crucial metric to monitor in this context is the funding rate, which reflects the urgency of buyers and sellers in executing trades. As illustrated in the chart, funding rates have experienced a sharp decline during the latest market turbulence, even turning negative. This drop suggests heightened selling pressure and fear-driven activity in response to the hack. If this trend persists, particularly with continued resistance at the $3K level, further declines could follow, with sellers eyeing $2.5K as the next major support. Historically, such steep drops in funding rates often lead to a phase of sideways consolidation with increased volatility. In this case, the $2.5K–$3K range could act as the primary trading zone until market sentiment stabilizes. The post Will Weak Momentum Drive ETH to $2.5K?

Three projects in particular have been making headlines recently, HyperLiquid (HYPE), Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR), and Rollblock (RBLK). This article will explore what these cryptocurrencies have to offer and what their prospects are heading into the most euphoric phase of the bull run. Why Rollblock Could Be This Year’s Big Surprise Ethereum-based GambleFi platform Rollblock taps into the massive potential of the $540 billion gaming industry which is increasingly migrating online. By leveraging blockchain technology, Rollblock ensures easily traceable transactions that are both cost-effective and immune to tampering. This will allow players to enjoy a seamless stress-free experience, supported by a state-of-the-art interface for next-level immersion. Rollblock is fully licensed by Anjouan Gaming and Gaming Curacao and is already generating substantial revenue, with $1.75 million recorded in December alone. Hundreds of new players sign up daily, and more than 50,000 have joined the Rollblock ranks. Users can seamlessly access a 7,000-title catalog that caters to every taste, from blackjack to roulette, from live games to brand-new, AI-enhanced exclusives. With a 50% presale bonus now live, buyers are racing to secure early returns before the token's expected 50x surge. Staking RBLK will allow holders to earn some of the highest APYs on the market via the generous revenue-sharing model. On a weekly basis, the Rollblock will reinvest up to 30% of its revenue to perform open-market buybacks of RBLK, which will then be redistributed to investors or burned. This is significant because, through deflationary pressure, the price of RBLK will remain stable even in times of heightened volatility while priming it for scarcity-driven growth. HyperLiquid Teases Breakout After Prolonged Ranging Action HyperLiquid (HYPE) is a relatively new project that has taken the Layer 1 space by storm as it rose by nearly 1,000% in the span of a month, hitting an all-time high of $35 in late December. As market turbulence intensified, a large portion of HyperLiquid’s gains were returned to the market as it entered a narrow trading channel. However, HyperLiquid’s losses have been relatively tame when compared to the double-digit drawdowns that most other altcoins experienced. At the time of writing, HyperLiquid trades at $24.50 with little to no movement in terms of price action. Just recently HyperLiquid has launched HyperEVM on testnet, enhancing its blockchain with smart contract functionality while maintaining low-latency trading. HYPE, HyperLiquid’s native token, will serve as the gas token alongside WHYPE for DeFi applications and cross-chain transfers. A bug bounty program offers substantial rewards to strengthen security, as HyperLiquid continues its market expansion. As buying pressure is ramping up, analysts expect HyperLiquid to see a breakout to the upside in the coming weeks and possibly conquer new peaks by the end of Q1, with a target above $100 once the bull run reaches escape velocity. Hedera Enters Buy Zone After Breakdown Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) is another Layer 1 that has been gaining massive traction over the past year, surging from $0.04 to a local peak of $0.37 in record time. As selling pressure intensified, Hedera retraced, as it entered a consolidation phase around the $0.21 mark. During the last month, speculation about a potential Hedera ETF started circulating, leading to a jump in trading activity as market participants rushed to buy the news. Canary, a fund manager, has already filed for an HBAR-focused ETF, with analysts suggesting it has a strong chance of SEC approval under the crypto-friendly Trump administration. Moreover, the Hedera blockchain is expanding in the RWA sector, recently partnering with World Gemological Institute and Vaultik to tokenize $3 billion in luxury assets. Currently, Hedera sells for $0.21, following a 4% decline in the last 24 hours accompanied by a steady trading volume of around $367 million. Join The RBLK Presale Before The Next Price Increase Stage 10 of the presale is selling out quickly, and RBLK sells for just $0.06. As interest in GambleFi rises and once Rollblock hits major exchanges, analysts expect a massive 100x multiplier in 2025s. Early investors could see exponential returns if they take action today.

Here’s a Coin Guaranteed to Do It and Pump Higher,https://timestabloid.com/can-shiba-inu-and-cardano-break-their-all-time-highs-in-2025/,"The cryptocurrency markets show growing attention to Shiba Inu and Cardano as investors speculate about these tokens reaching new peaks in 2025. Both projects have strong communities and ongoing developments, but market conditions and competition could influence their performance. While SHIB and ADA work toward potential breakouts, one rising project, Rexas Finance, is already catching attention. Investors believe this new coin has the fundamentals and momentum to surge even further. With innovative features and growing investor interest, Rexas Finance could be a game-changer in the next market cycle. Here’s why it stands out. Shiba Inu 1 month Performance Over the past month, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has dropped 28.64%, falling from $0.00002117 to $0.00001516. The price attempted a rally but faced resistance near $0.000021, leading to a steady decline. Trading volume has decreased by 10.84%, signaling lower market activity. Despite the downtrend, SHIB maintains an $8.93B market cap. To break its all-time high in 2025, SHIB needs stronger bullish momentum and ecosystem growth. Meanwhile, rising projects like Rexas Finance could attract investors looking for new breakout opportunities. Cardano Bearish Sentiment. Cardano (ADA) has faced a 25.61% decline over the past month, dropping from $0.9287 to $0.6942. The price showed early strength, peaking near $1.10 before experiencing a sharp correction. Increased volatility and profit-taking led to a steep fall below $0.70. Despite this, trading volume has risen by 6.09%, indicating continued market interest. For ADA to reclaim its all-time high in 2025, it must regain key resistance levels. Meanwhile, rising projects like Rexas Finance are gaining momentum, with strong presale performance and upcoming exchange listings drawing investor attention. Rexas Finance’s Rapid Growth and RWAs Integration Rexas Finance is gaining massive traction, driven by its focus on real-world assets (RWAs). By bridging traditional finance with blockchain, it enables seamless tokenization of physical assets, attracting institutional and retail investors. This innovation has fueled demand, pushing its presale price from just $0.03 to $0.20, an impressive near 8x surge. With the last presale stage underway, fundraising has reached $45.5 million, marking 85% completion. Investors are showing confidence in the project’s long-term vision, betting on its potential to disrupt the market with real-world use cases and strong fundamentals. Milestone Alert!

The exchange’s CEO, Ben Zhou, announced that multiple industry leaders have joined forces to track, contain, and minimize the impact of the exploit.

Your dedication and collaboration helped us navigate the situation… pic.twitter.com/jvX683iA0U — Bybit (@Bybit_Official) February 22, 2025 The response has united both centralized and decentralized finance sectors, with key infrastructure providers implementing immediate protective measures. Orbiter, deBridge, SynFutures, MYX, Thruster, and Owlto moved quickly to blacklist addresses linked to the exploit. Chainalysis has provided crucial support by tracking and publishing the attacker’s wallet addresses. Several blockchain security firms strengthened the defensive effort. SIS cross-chain bridge blocked associated addresses to prevent asset laundering, while Zero Shadows activated its round-the-clock Global Response team to assist with bad actor tracing and law enforcement communications.

He emphasized Bybit’s commitment to strengthening security and liquidity while fostering industry-wide collaboration. So far, on-chain investigator ZachXBT identified North Korea’s Lazarus Group as the masterminds behind the hack. The investigation shared that hackers exploited Bybit’s Ethereum ( ETH ) multisig cold wallet during a routine transfer to the exchange’s warm wallet. The attackers manipulated the signing interface, making it display the correct wallet address while altering the underlying smart contract logic. Lazarus Group is also linked to last year’s DMM Bitcoin Exchange Hack. In May, Japan-based DMM Bitcoin suffered a security breach resulting in the theft of approximately $305 million. Last July, India’s WazirX exchange was compromised, leading to a loss of about $235 million. This incident was also linked to the Lazarus.

Could this AI-powered meme innovation eclipse Ethereum's expected climb? Here's a closer look at what might lie ahead for these digital assets.

However, analysts warn that if the approval doesn’t go through, Ripple could face a significant downturn. Market enthusiasm alone isn’t enough to sustain the current price levels. Amid this uncertainty, many investors are diversifying their portfolios by entering Rollblock’s presale. The project has already raised over $10.7 million from 50,000 early investors, and with momentum building, RBLK is emerging as one of the most promising presale altcoins of 2025. Rollblock Reshapes the $450 Billion Gaming Market with Blockchain Tech Rollblock is redefining online gaming by combining the excitement of traditional casinos with the security of blockchain technology, tackling one of the industry’s biggest challenges – scams. Over the past two years, iGaming fraud has surged by 60%, and experts predict this trend will continue in 2025. Rollblock runs its entire gaming ecosystem on the Ethereum blockchain to combat this. Its 7,000+ game library includes live dealer games like poker and blackjack, AI-powered slots, and sports betting on global events such as MMA and Formula 1. Every game outcome is encrypted and permanently recorded on-chain, ensuring absolute fairness and preventing manipulation. Trust in the platform is further reinforced by its e-gaming license from the Anjouan Gaming Authority and a SolidProof-audited smart contract system. These measures confirm Rollblock’s commitment to security and transparency. This innovative approach is already delivering impressive results. Rollblock has seen $1.75 million in wagers and a 600% spike in deposits and signups, signaling growing confidence among players. Rollblock’s presale has also gained traction, raising over $10.7 million from 50,000 early investors across ten presale rounds – a testament to its potential in the GameFi space. Many factors drive the massive interest in Rollblock, including its revenue-sharing model. The protocol allocates up to 30% of its revenue to buying back RBLK tokens from the market. Of these tokens, 60% are burned, creating scarcity and supporting long-term price growth. The remaining 40% are distributed to stakers as rewards, offering some of the highest APYs in the industry. With a 50% presale bonus now live, Investors are rushing to secure early returns before the token's expected 100x surge. Brazil Approves the First Spot Ripple ETF Ripple is pivotal as it consolidates within a symmetrical triangle formation. Currently trading at around $2.68, the token tests key support at $2.50. This level aligns with the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level. A breakout above $2.75 could confirm a bullish move, pushing Ripple toward $3.05 and $3.50. If support at $2.50 fails, the price may drop toward the $2.29–$1.95 range. Technical indicators present a mixed outlook. The RSI suggests a possible rebound but low trading volume signals market uncertainty. Ripple could regain momentum if buying pressure picks up, but failure to reclaim $2.75 may lead to further consolidation. Meanwhile, institutional adoption is gaining traction. Brazil has approved its first spot Ripple ETF, a significant milestone that could drive broader interest. Braza Group is launching BBRL, a real-pegged stablecoin built on the XRP Ledger. These launches will expand Ripple’s role in Latin American markets. Is Rollblock the Next 100x Gem? Analysts predict that if Rollblock sustains its current momentum, RBLK could reach $1 by the end of 2025, with tokens currently selling for $0.06.

Rollblock is making significant strides, demonstrating that even in uncertain financial climates, there are opportunities for growth and innovation. This development is particularly crucial as Rollblock's innovative use of blockchain technology attracts investors worldwide. The Evolution of Blockchain in Gaming with Rollblock In an era where scams have plagued the online gaming industry, Rollblock emerges as a beacon of reliability by leveraging blockchain technology. Traditional casinos have long dominated the scene, but Rollblock offers an alluring alternative by ensuring transparency and fairness. This approach addresses the alarming 60% increase in iGaming fraud observed over the past two years. Employing the Ethereum blockchain, Rollblock houses an impressive selection of over 7,000 games, including live dealer options like poker and blackjack, alongside AI-enhanced slots and global sports betting. This diverse offering not only diversifies the player's experience but also assures integrity as game outcomes are permanently recorded and encrypted on the blockchain. Strategic Moves in the Financial Arena Rollblock isn't just about gaming innovation; its economic model is equally impressive. A standout feature is its revenue-sharing strategy, where 30% of its earnings are allocated to purchasing back RBLK tokens. This mechanism ensures scarcity by burning 60% of these tokens, thereby supporting price stability and growth. The remaining 40% are distributed among stakers, offering attractive APYs. With a 50% presale bonus currently underway, investors are eagerly participating in Rollblock’s presale, aiming to capitalize on the expected 100x price surge. The platform's success, reflected in its impressive $1.75 million wager achievement and a 600% increase in deposits and signups, is a testament to its robust market positioning. Ripple's Influence Expands with Brazil's ETF Approval Meanwhile, Ripple is making strategic moves of its own. The recent approval of the first spot Ripple ETF in Brazil marks a significant milestone, potentially broadening Ripple's reach in Latin American markets. This expansion is further supported by initiatives like the launch of BBRL, a real-pegged stablecoin on the XRP Ledger by Braza Group. Despite the positive developments, Ripple's price stability is still under scrutiny. Trading around $2.68, it faces crucial support at $2.50, a level critical for sustaining any bullish trajectory. Failing to break past $2.75 might lead to further consolidation, suggesting that market dynamics could change rapidly with investor sentiment. Prospects for the Future: Why Rollblock is a Game Changer As the gaming and crypto worlds evolve, Rollblock's current momentum hints at a potential transformation in the market landscape. With analysts predicting RBLK to soar to $1 by the close of 2025 from its current $0.06, early investors could witness exponential returns. This trajectory not only promises impressive financial rewards but also underscores Rollblock's growing influence in the GameFi sector. For those eager to explore the prospects Rollblock offers, the presale presents a compelling opportunity to join a project poised for remarkable growth.

Let’s find out more. Ethereum Reduced onchain activity has led to a sharp decline in Ethereum transaction fees , bringing costs to the lowest since 2020, and raising concerns about overall network demand. An anonymous programmer has made headlines by burning and donating significant amounts of Ethereum in an effort to draw attention to claims of mind-control technology. Altcoins Brazil’s CVM has approved the world's first XRP-based ETF , managed by Hashdex, marking a significant step in institutional crypto adoption amid growing interest in XRP investment products.

As a hot topic in the blockchain field, cloud mining has attracted the attention of more and more investors. The JAMining platform stands out for its convenient and efficient services. In a crypto landscape cluttered with speculative tokens, BitLemons ($BLEM) has emerged as a standout performer, demonstrating why serious investors are racing to secure their positions. Business SafeMoon LLC’s Chief Technology Officer, Thomas Smith , has pled guilty to securities fraud conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy, admitting to his role in a multi-million dollar cryptocurrency fraud scheme. Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), is raising $2 billion through a convertible debt offering to expand its Bitcoin holdings, continuing its aggressive treasury strategy. DefiTuna has severed ties with an investor and accused M3M3, along with Meteora’s leadership, of orchestrating a $200 million market manipulation scheme that exploited memecoin launches. Web3 DeFi ecosystem and Web 3 payment solution CrossFi announced a major five-company partnership deal to accelerate its growth and expand its DeFi ecosystem. The partnerships, announced Thursday, include major DeFi players and venture capital firms such as Enflux, ApeBond, Victus Global, Alpha Token Capital, and Pinnacle Ventures. Play-to-Earn is evolving into a hybrid Play-and-Own model where ownership, rather than financial speculation, becomes the key value proposition. The next wave of web3 games will emphasize gameplay mechanics and storytelling that ensure web3 elements are seamless rather than intrusive.

Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00001584, down 26%. It is obvious that investors are looking for clearer alternatives. In this context, we come across DTX Exchange . 800% presales growth signals the next flow direction of capital. This hybrid platform, which combines the accessibility of crypto with traditional financial infrastructure, can provide great strategic advantages with early participation. DOGE Traders Shift Funds After Dogecoin Price Dips Industry experts point to the decline in interest in meme coins as an important factor. Traders are increasingly sceptical that the Dogecoin price can regain its previous highs. Some threads on Reddit are saying that the Dogecoin price could potentially rise to $1 during Bitcoin’s rally. Most forecasts now emphasise caution, noting selling pressures around $0.75. Source: Dogecoin Price, Monthly Chart, CoinMarketCap Discussions highlight concerns about new meme coins and the Dogecoin price muddying the market and the absence of major catalysts such as Elon Musk’s past endorsements. The sensitivity of the community creates an uncertainty on this issue. The DOGE narrative is limited to the original meme coin, which may not be enough this cycle, said one Reddit user. With Bitcoin’s increasing dominance, investors are reallocating their capital to projects that offer clearer benefits and growth potential. The data shows that the Dogecoin price fell as we mentioned. This is an indication of declining retail participation. While long-term investors have tried to remain optimistic about the Dogecoin price, the lack of new developments has shifted attention to platforms that combine innovation with stability. Many industry experts believe that the days of DOGE leading rallies may be over. Investors want fundamentals, not just hype. Investors Pull Back as Shiba Inu Falls 26% This Month Shiba Inu’s monthly drop highlights the growing challenges for meme-based tokens. The decline follows a broader market trend where investors are prioritising projects with tangible use cases over viral appeal. Recent problems, such as exchange listing discrepancies causing sudden price fluctuations, have further undermined confidence in Shiba Inu. Competition from new meme coins has increased on platforms like Solana. However, problems such as liquidity started. Some industry professionals claimed that retail traders were chasing quick gains with low-value coins instead of holding Shiba Inu. This change caused Shiba Inu to struggle to maintain its position and trading volumes decreased on a weekly basis. Source: DOGE Vs. Shiba Inu Price Comparison, CoinMarketCap Despite their strong community, DOGE and Shiba Inu’s lack of expanding the ecosystem compared to its competitors was revealed. Developers have yet to announce major upgrades, leading some holders to turn to alternatives. DTX’s Hybrid Exchange Revolution Passes 800% Growth With the slowdown in meme coins, a new DeFi project is gaining attention with its hybrid trading platform. DTX Exchange’s price jumped 800% from $0.02 to $0.18 during the presale, driven by demand from more than 700,000 registered users. The platform’s integration of centralised and decentralised features could make it the best cryptocurrency to invest in ahead of the second quarter launch. Unlike Shiba Inu and DOGE, the platform bridges traditional and digital finance by offering access to 120,000 assets, including cryptocurrencies, stocks and ETFs. The Layer-1 blockchain provides transparency and security by increasing reliability with audits conducted by firms such as SolidProof. According to many experts, combining CEX efficiency with DEX autonomy could be a game-changer. DTX Exchange, which will start listing on major exchanges such as Binance, is preparing to capitalize on changing investor preferences. The project’s focus on fractional trading and 1000x leverage appeals to both retail and institutional audiences. As the presale enters its bonus phase, market observers predict that it could draw a better graph than Shiba Inu and DOGE’s early trajectory. In Summary With DOGE and Shiba Inu facing declines of 31% and 26% this month, investors are prioritising platforms that combine innovation with utility. With access to 120,000 assets and a hybrid exchange model offering 800% presale growth, DTX Exchange combines blockchain security with traditional finance.

In a detailed explanation, CZ outlined major vulnerabilities and offered insights into security practices for both exchanges and users. CZ noted a disturbing pattern in recent attacks affecting multiple exchanges, including ByBit, Phemex, and WazirX. According to the founder, hackers managed to steal significant amounts of crypto from multi-sig cold storage solutions. In the case of ByBit, the hackers manipulated the front-end interface to display legitimate transactions while a different transaction was actually being signed. He admitted that he was less familiar with the details of the other incidents, but noted that based on available information, they appeared to have similar attack patterns. What’s even more concerning, CZ said, is that these exchanges use different multi-sig solution providers, suggesting that the attacks were not limited to a single vulnerability. The hacking group responsible, identified as the infamous Lazarus Group, is known for its advanced cyber capabilities. It remains unclear whether the breaches were caused by compromised signing devices, server-side infiltrations, or both. Related News: Ethereum Developer and Bybit CEO Responds to the Idea of “Rolling Back the Ethereum Network” to Recover Stolen Funds Amid ongoing concerns, CZ reiterated its long-standing security principles. It defended its recommendation to halt all withdrawals following a security breach as a standard precautionary measure. While some criticized its stance, it argued that halting withdrawals allows exchanges to thoroughly investigate the breach, understand the attack vectors, and ensure all systems are secure before resuming operations. He cited Binance’s experience in 2019 when it was hit with a $40 million hack. Binance stopped withdrawals for a week, which, contrary to fears, resulted in more deposits than withdrawals when services resumed. However, CZ explained that each situation is unique and the decision to halt operations should be made based on the information available. CZ commended ByBit CEO Ben Zhou for his transparency and composure in handling the security breach. He contrasted Zhou’s approach with what he described as the “less transparent” way issues were handled by other crypto exchange leaders like WazirX and the now-defunct FTX. While he declined to comment on WazirX due to ongoing legal proceedings, he firmly labeled FTX’s collapse as a case of fraud rather than a security failure. *This is not investment advice.

40730969,https://crypto.news/?p=14339517,1740315960,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/40730969.jpeg,"Trump is right to ban CBDCs, and other countries will follow | Opinion",https://crypto.news/trump-is-to-ban-cbdcs-and-other-countries-will-follow/,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. Banning digital assets makes about as much sense as regulating against gravity. How many times did the market dip, back in 2017, on the news that China was banning Bitcoin ( BTC ), only to promptly recover at the realization of the notion’s absurdity? You might also like: Trump’s trade war: Tariffs, recession risks, and crypto volatility | Opinion But while Bitcoin is, to all intents and purposes, unbannable, the same can’t be said of central bank digital currencies—digital forms of national currencies issued and regulated by their central banks. In fact, that’s one of their core properties. Otherwise, governments couldn’t put their citizens in the naughty chair when they fall out of line by prohibiting their right to buy groceries. To be fair, most governments aren’t as heavy-handed as China, with its notorious social credit scoring and rampant surveillance. Instead, they are seeking to develop digital currencies for boring bureaucratic purposes, such as greater administrative efficiency and economic data gathering. Still, it’s no coincidence that China has been one of the biggest proponents of CBDCs and is racing ahead with its own implementation. And it should, therefore, come as no surprise that the United States, which instinctively inverts every Chinese position, should have canceled its own digital dollar after President Trump laid the banhammer. There’s a beautiful yin and yang-ness to China banning Bitcoin and the US banning CBDCs. The self-perpetuating cycle is complete. Trump’s decision , like many that emulate from his “shoot first and ask questions later” government, is somewhat reactionary. However, sometimes, shooting first is the smartest thing you can do, and in this case, Trump has hit the target. America’s digital dollar deserves to be shot down—as do those of every other Western nation. Not because the concept is wrong but because the implementation certainly is. If billions of citizens are going to have their data and financial assets placed on a global database, it’s going to need much better privacy protections than the current proposals offer. The first domino falls There are all kinds of ironies wrapped up in Trump’s decision to ban digital dollar. Like his willingness to countenance a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve or endorse a $TRUMP memecoin while simultaneously shunning a digital currency with a potential real-world use case. But even his most vocal critics have had little to say about this mandate. While the US was by no means the staunchest advocate for a digital currency, with numerous nations much closer to launching their own efforts, the idea was very much on the table until Trump yanked the cloth. In becoming the first President to outright ban a CBDC, he’s tipped a domino that could cause other nations to follow suit, and the reason cited resonates with the people—privacy. While other Western nations, especially in Europe, like to maintain the impression that they’re nobody’s master, the uncomfortable truth is that US decisions exert a strong pull on EU policy. Thus, America’s curtailing of its own CBDC will inevitably weaken the case for the EU’s digital euro and prompt renewed scrutiny of the purported privacy protections. If the EU wishes to get its own CBDC over the line, it will first need to return to the drawing board. No privacy, no point Despite the digital euro being described as being “as private as cash,” this isn’t strictly true. The potential for governments, NGOs, and other shadowy organizations to gain unwarranted insight into citizens’ spending habits—and to censor transactions or “cancel” customers altogether—is very real. That’s not to suggest that backers of the digital euro are acting out of bad faith necessarily, more out of bad tech. Blockchain evolves fast while the wheels of policymaking turn slow, meaning that by the time digital currency pilots have been greenlit, the underlying tech is already looking tired. As anyone directly involved in web3 will tell you, there are now far better ways to enforce onchain privacy while maintaining compliance—ways that don’t involve placing the privacy of every citizen on a massive database and then broadcasting it for all the world to see. From ZK proofs to fully homomorphic encryption, privacy standards have become more robust and feature-rich in recent years, allowing for nuanced disclosure of sensitive data without leaving it at risk of exposure to centralized entities and potential malicious actors. Crucially, onchain encryption standards have also become much lighter, allowing for more efficient computation. Indeed, ZKs and FHE are the sorts of technologies that would be ideally suited to facilitating the outcomes the EU wishes to achieve with its digital euro, such as tiered privacy in which low-value purchases are lightly scrutinized and high-value ones are subject to more intensive checks. The good news is it’s not too late to remedy this: the digital euro is still at an early stage, with its final implementation still being worked out. There’s time to get this right. If there’s one thing we’ve learned from the whirlwind that is the Trump administration, it’s that a lot can be achieved in a month. There’s no need to move fast and break stuff. But make no mistake, the EU does need to move and signal that its own digital currency will be everything the proposed digital yuans and dollars of the world are not: Secure. Private. Robust. Otherwise, it risks being canceled, just like CBDCs in the US.

Table of Contents Investors are flocking to FloppyPepe for massive gains Can Dogecoin sustain its rally and hit $1.5?

With its roots in Matt Furie’s legacy, experts believe this rising meme coin, currently priced at $0.0000002, could deliver massive gains.

Its FloppyX platform simplifies AI-generated video production, while the Meme-o-Matic tool improves meme-based engagement through text-to-image AI. Users can connect with polls and prompts and give feedback through the Meme-o-Matic interactive content generation features, which differentiates it from other platforms.

Crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that the Dogecoin price has pulled back to the 0.618 Fibonacci level, also known as the Golden Ratio. This key support zone has historically been the site of bullish reversals, suggesting Dogecoin could regain momentum. Conclusion Built on Matt Furie’s legacy, FloppyPepe simplifies crypto transactions, enabling swift payments without complex conversions. Its built-in referral program also rewards investors with extra tokens for inviting new users. Investors can also benefit from airdrop campaigns.

Recently, the exchange suffered a breach involving over $1.5 billion worth of liquid-staked Ether, Mantle Staked ETH, and other ERC-20 tokens, marking the largest crypto theft in history. Within just two days of the attack, Bybit replenished nearly 50% of its Ether reserves, according to data from CryptoQuant . Bybit recovers reserves as industry rallies to support the exchange As of 8:52 am UTC, Bybit held over 201,600 Ether (ETH), recovering more than 45% of its pre-hack reserves. Before the $1.5 billion breach on February 21, the exchange had 439,000 ETH, temporarily plummeting to just 61,000 ETH. A significant portion of Bybit’s replenished reserves comes from spot purchases. Since the exploit, the exchange has acquired 106,498 ETH—worth approximately $295 million—through over-the-counter (OTC) trades, according to a February 23 post by crypto intelligence platform Lookonchain . Crypto industry leaders and exchanges also rushed to assist Bybit with emergency transfers, including 50,000 Ether from Binance, 40,000 Ether from Bitget, and 10,000 Ether from Du Jun, co-founder of HTX Group, among others. Bybit’s ability to restore its reserves while continuing to process user withdrawals signals strong trust in the exchange, especially after enduring the largest hack in crypto and financial history. Within just 10 hours of the exploit, Bybit handled over 350,000 withdrawal requests, successfully completing 99.9% of them by 1:45 am UTC, according to a February 22 post by co-founder and CEO Ben Zhou. The crypto industry has provided Bybit with $390 million worth of Ether in emergency loans and transfers to help stabilize its reserves. Since the hack, the exchange has received a total of 145,000 ETH, including $127 million from Binance-based whales and over $53 million from a single whale wallet, according to a February 22 post by Lookonchain. Still, DefiLlama data shows that Bybit’s total asset value dropped by more than $5.3 billion within a day of the incident despite the support, including the $1.4 billion lost in the hack. Despite the hack and the decline in assets, Bybit’s exchange reserves still surpass its liabilities, according to its independent proof-of-reserve (PoR) auditor, Hacken. In a February 21 post on X, Hacken confirmed: Today’s hack was massive—a tough hit for the industry. But here’s the bottom line: Bybit’s reserves still exceed its liabilities. As their independent PoR auditor, we’ve confirmed that user funds remain fully backed. ~ Hacken Investigators link North Korean Lazarus Group to Bybit hack Blockchain security analysts, including Arkham Intelligence and on-chain investigator ZachXBT, have linked the Bybit hack to the North Korean state-backed Lazarus Group—the same entity suspected in the $600 million Ronin network breach. Meir Dolev, co-founder and CTO of Cyvers noted that the attack bore similarities to the $230 million WazirX hack and the $58 million Radiant Capital exploit. He explained that Bybit’s Ethereum multisig cold wallet was compromised through a deceptive transaction, which tricked signers into unknowingly approving a malicious smart contract logic change. According to Dolev, the hacker then took control of the wallet and drained funds to an unknown address.

Some analysts believe that a break above $106,000 could spark another rally, while others caution that a drop below $92,000–$94,000 may open the doors to $85,000 or lower. Prominent crypto trader Pentoshi suggested in a Feb. 22 X post that if Bitcoin reclaims $106K, it could lead to “a new round of price discovery,” hinting at the potential for fresh all-time highs. However, if Bitcoin fails to hold its current support levels, a retest of $85,000—a price not seen since Nov. 12—becomes a strong possibility. Crypto analyst AlejandroBTC echoed this concern, stating that Bitcoin’s current chart structure “kinda looks like we’re heading for $85K.” Bullish Sentiment Remains Despite Short-Term Risks Despite the potential downside, Pentoshi maintains a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, noting that the cryptocurrency has been consolidating within its current range for an extended period without breaking down. “For now, have to remain in a bullish bias as it hasn’t broken down, and we’ve spent a lot of time in this range now,” he explained. Not all traders share the same level of optimism. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes recently warned that Bitcoin could still pull back to the $70,000–$75,000 range, an event he believes could trigger a “mini financial crisis.” Meanwhile, pseudonymous trader Mister Crypto stated that he would only consider opening a major trade at $90,000, waiting for clearer signals. Bitcoin at $1.5M by 2030? While short-term price action remains uncertain, some analysts are focusing on Bitcoin’s long-term potential . On Feb. 12, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood reiterated her bullish forecast, increasing the odds of Bitcoin reaching $1.5 million by 2030. Wood pointed to the growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin as a sign that its long-term value is stronger than ever. Meanwhile, trader AshCrypto expects Bitcoin to reach a new all-time high by March, citing historical data from CoinGlass, which shows that Bitcoin has delivered an average 13.42% return in March since 2013.

According to the report , the yen’s status as a primary funding currency in the foreign exchange (FX) market could be questioned in the coming months. The evolving Japanese financial landscape could see an increased risk of rapid unwinding in yen carry trades, raising the need for alternative funding currencies and a diversification of currency exposure for traders. Effectiveness of the Yen Carry Trade Over the last three decades, the BoJ has maintained ultra-loose monetary policies, sustaining a zero or negative interest rate environment to fight inflation and stimulate economic growth. As a result, the yen carry trade has been a fundamental strategy for traders in global FX markets. Carry trade is a strategy where FX traders take advantage of differences in interest rates between currencies. This popular investment strategy entails borrowing money in currencies with low interest rates and investing in stocks and bonds based on other currencies with higher interest rates. Due to the yen’s low interest rates, it has remained an attractive funding currency over the years. Bybit noted that the effectiveness of the yen carry trade has been closely linked to global economic conditions like the U.S. Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hikes. However, this carry trade has also been vulnerable to periods of financial stress and is becoming increasingly reliant on stable currency conditions. This year, macroeconomic factors reshaping Japan’s economy are driving a significant transformation in the landscape for the yen trade. These factors include rising inflation, wage growth, and speculation about changes in the BoJ’s monetary policies. Adaptability and Diversification Before now, Japan has struggled with deflation and stagnant wage growth; however, recent years have seen inflation consistently surpass the BoJ’s long-standing 2% target. Since the BoJ has historically maintained ultra-loose policies, growing inflationary pressures may cause the central bank to hike interest rates. The implications of such decisions could cause a ripple effect in global FX dynamics, altering the yen’s appeal for carry trades. While the yen may continue to serve as the preferred currency for carry trades, the BoJ’s actions could gradually reduce its dominance. Bybit said FX traders could explore other high-yielding currencies like the Mexican peso (MXN), South African rand (ZAR), and Turkish lira (TRY) as alternatives to the yen; however, each currency comes with risks. “Ultimately, the key to navigating the evolving carry trade landscape in 2025 lies in adaptability,” Bybit noted, adding that traders need dynamic risk management strategies and diversification to remain afloat.

Professionals in the sector are certain that 2025 will be an interesting year for cryptocurrencies without any question. Which of these tokens, nevertheless, would mint investors large profits in the next months? Will it be the fascinating new PayFi option in Remittix or Dogecoin, the meme currency driving the craze? Read on to find out. Dogecoin Price Is Set To Make a Comeback Launched in 2013, Dogecoin is generally agreed throughout the community as the forerunner of the meme-based crypto niche. Though it started as a joke, Dogecoin now features one of the largest ecosystems available. Following crypto expert Ali Martinez’s Monday revelation that Dogecoin price has been generating lower lows and lower highs, Dogecoin holders have been on great alert. Although it has generated questions, the latest Dogecoin price performance has not helped either. At $0.2522 right now, Dogecoin price has dropped 31.90% over the last month. From its December high, charts indicate Dogecoin price has been on a messy downward trend. Industry analysts think a big trigger is required to turn the negative trend of Dogecoin upside down. That spark could be closer than we could ever think. There are growing rumors that this year a Dogecoin ETF may be authorized. The SEC accepted Grayscale’s ETF petition last week, therefore raising market expectations. Why Remittix Could Produce Millionaires This Year Remittix, a new PayFi project, is forging its own path with a pragmatic twist that’s catching investors’ attention. Just at $0.0628 today, this PayFi innovator claims to simplify cross-border payments, a segment ready for upheaval. Remittix’s goal is to overcome long-standing issues in international finance by means of its creative solution for conventional remittance systems. Imagine being able to easily turn crypto into spendable money without KYC complications and costs free of sting. The PayFi ecosystem within Remittix offers consumers a simple way to instantaneously convert cryptocurrencies into fiat money, therefore allowing swift borderless money transfers at minimal cost. Smart investors and traders find resonance in this Remittix; early users have reported a three- hundred percent increase in portfolio value. Unlike many initiatives motivated only by hype, Remittix offers real value by allowing seamless, almost instantaneous crypto-to-fiat exchanges. Remittix not only streamlines world payments but also closes the distance between the digital asset ecosystem and conventional financial institutions by supporting over 40 crypto pairings and more than 30 fiat currencies. Buy Remittix Now For Massive Profits Remittix is opening the path for a new age of blockchain usefulness with a committed strategy, strong security and compliance policies, and an eye on financial inclusivity. The RTX currency has a good investing potential at $0.0645 and forecasts suggest a considerable rise; demand for unique cross-border payment solutions could generate up to a 25x multiplier in the presale period and over 15,000% growth post launch.

Cardano ( ADA ) was trading at $0.80, down by over 40% from its highest level in December last year. The coin wavered after Hoskinson, its founder, blasted Ethereum and Solana in a long YouTube interview. In it, he noted that its biggest differentiating factor was that it was working on integrating with Bitcoin — a move that he believes is an unexplored $2 trillion opportunity. He said : “Somebody is going to crack it. We will work on it hard as we aim to be the Decentralized Finance or DeFi layer of the Bitcoin network. I don’t think it Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ) have what it takes to achieve this.” Hoskinson’s interview came a few months after Cardano announced a partnership with BitcoinOS . This integration is expected to be activated in the next few months. Cardano is not the first blockchain to create a Bitcoin layer. Core, a layer-2 for Bitcoin’s ecosystem, has attracted 53 developers and a total value locked of $626 million. Stacks ( STX ) has 12 dApps and $104 million in assets.

L2 networks like Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism have become key players in the Ethereum network, handling transactions worth billions of dollars. These L2 networks are popular because of their lower transaction fees and the fact that they leverage Ethereum’s security. He also blasted Solana, a highly popular Cardano competitor, arguing that it cannot survive, especially when data moved in its ecosystem surges. Hoskinson’s interview came a week ahead of his so-called VIP meeting. Crypto analysts anticipate it will be X owner Elon Musk. Cardano price forecast ADA price chart | Source: crypto.news The weekly chart shows that ADA price peaked at $1.32 in November last year and then retreated. Its upper side was a crucial level since it coincided with the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level. Cardano then retreated to $0.524 as it moved to form the second phase of the Elliot Wave pattern.

We’ve found it, and you don’t want to miss out. Say hello to Dawgz AI - a meme coin that actually does something. It’s built for fun and profit, giving investors a chance to grow their holdings without the usual stress of trading. I’ve been in crypto long enough to know that getting in early is everything. Imagine picking up Solana when it was just a dollar - that kind of opportunity doesn’t come around often. Dawgz AI is packed with automated trade bots, working round the clock to help you make the most of Ethereum and chase big returns. If you let Solana slip past, don’t make that mistake again - Dawgz AI is the one to watch. The Best Crypto to Buy Now - Why Dawgz AI Is a No-Brainer Everyone’s looking for the best crypto to buy now, and if you’re after a game-changing investment, Dawgz AI is the one to watch. While Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies dominate the headlines, it’s early-stage projects that often bring the biggest returns. Solana started at just $1 before increasing to over $200. Imagine getting in before that explosion. Dawgz AI is not just another meme coin. It’s backed by AI-powered trading, a strong staking system, and a growing presale that’s already hit $1.8M. If you're serious about crypto investing, you don’t want to miss out on this one. Dawgz AI: A Meme Coin That Actually Does Something Most meme coins are nothing more than hype and speculation, but Dawgz AI is built differently. It combines fun and profitability, offering a real use case that sets it apart from the competition. Unlike typical crypto projects that rely purely on community-driven momentum, Dawgz AI integrates automated trading bots that work 24/7 to maximize profits. These bots analyze market performance in real time, adjusting strategies based on network security and market trends. The goal? To help investors make money without the stress of day-to-day crypto trading. Even better, Dawgz AI is built on Ethereum, the world’s leading smart contract platform, making it a secure and scalable option for both new and experienced crypto traders. Staking Rewards: Passive Income for ETH Holders Crypto is about making your investments work for you. Dawgz AI offers staking rewards, allowing ETH holders to earn passive income without lifting a finger. With a competitive APY, staking Dawgz AI means your digital assets grow over time, whether the crypto market is up or down. But why is staking important? It reduces sales pressure and increases security for the network, creating a stronger long-term investment. This is why some of the best-performing cryptocurrencies offer staking - it keeps users engaged and rewards long-term holders. Presale Is Blowing Up - And You’re Still Early Every successful crypto project has an early window where smart investors can get in before the price explodes. That’s exactly where Dawgz AI is right now. The presale has already raised over $1.8M, and the next milestone is $2.1M. As more buyers enter, the price will go up, meaning early adopters get the best deal. Think about Solana’s early days. If you had bought at $1, you’d be sitting on life-changing gains. Dawgz AI is in a similar position - it has strong fundamentals, a clear use case, and growing demand. The window is closing fast, and once the presale sells out, you’ll wish you had grabbed your share sooner. Tokenomics That Actually Make Sense One of the biggest red flags in crypto investing is bad tokenomics. If a coin has too much supply, bad allocation, or weak liquidity, it’s set up to fail. Dawgz AI avoids these mistakes with a well-structured supply of 8.888 billion tokens. Here’s how it’s distributed: 30% for presale – Early investors get first access 20% for staking – Incentivising long-term holders 10% for liquidity – Guaranteeing smooth trading The rest is allocated to development, marketing, and ecosystem growth This balanced approach guarantees that Dawgz AI remains stable, avoiding the sudden crashes that poorly designed meme coins often face. If you’re looking for a crypto investment with sustainable growth, Dawgz AI has the right foundation. Why Dawgz AI Could Be the Next Solana (And Maybe Even Bigger) What made Solana a top cryptocurrency wasn’t just hype - it was strong tech, real adoption, and a growing ecosystem. Dawgz AI is following the same pattern but with even more firepower. The biggest difference? Dawgz AI isn’t just a blockchain project - it’s AI-driven. While Solana focused on speed, Dawgz AI focused on profitability. With AI-powered trading bots running in the background, Dawgz AI gives users an edge over traditional altcoins. Investors can use automated tools to optimize their holdings. Plus, with staking rewards, a growing presale, and a dedicated community, the long-term potential is massive.

The company, known for its innovative approach to AI, is looking to scale up the graphics capabilities of its AI model, Grok, aiming to create graphics that rival AAA games. The news has caught the attention of both the tech world and crypto enthusiasts, creating a unique chance for investors to capitalize on $MIND , an AI-driven project infused with meme coin culture. If you’re looking for an exciting new crypto opportunity to get involved early, this could be your moment. xAI’s Ambitious Move into Gaming Musk’s vision for Grok isn’t just about improving an AI model. It’s about reshaping how we think about the intersection of gaming, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology. Grok, which powers xAI’s latest developments, is about to go through a major upgrade, enabling it to handle more complex tasks, including the creation of AAA-quality games. In a recent post on X, a developer demonstrated the potential of Grok by simply describing an asteroid-type game in English, and voila – the game came to life. It’s as if Grok has a magical translator for ideas, instantly transforming words into immersive experiences. Imagine what can be done when the AI’s graphic resolution gets a major boost. But that’s not all. xAI is also setting up a dedicated gaming studio. This new venture is poised to bring cutting-edge AI technology to the world of video games, blurring the lines between creativity and machine learning. If you’re a fan of both gaming and AI, this is an exciting time to be paying attention. Mind of Pepe: The AI Agent That Could Take Over Your Portfolio While xAI focuses on revolutionizing gaming, there’s another hidden gem that could reshape your crypto portfolio. Enter the Mind of Pepe presale – an AI agent that promises to be your secret weapon in the crypto market. And let’s be clear: this isn’t just another altcoin . It’s backed by the potential of AI and the ever-growing meme coin culture that’s taking over crypto. $MIND has already raised $6.7M in its presale – a strong indicator of investor confidence in this AI-powered project. At its current price of $0.0033857 per token, $MIND is still in its early stages, which means the opportunity to get in on the ground floor is ripe. How $MIND Fits Into AI and Gaming Think of $MIND as a bridge between the world of meme coins and the world of artificial intelligence. The $MIND token powers an AI agent that’s designed to assist with decision-making, predictions, and perhaps most excitingly, trading in the crypto market. This isn’t just some passive bot sitting idly in your wallet—$MIND is actively working to help its holders make smarter, data-driven decisions. Much like how Grok is improving its ability to create games, Mind of Pepe is improving its ability to predict market trends. This AI-powered agent is fed with real-time data and equipped with powerful algorithms, allowing it to offer insights that would typically take humans hours of analysis. But with $MIND, it’s all at your fingertips. With xAI’s gaming studio in the mix, there’s the possibility that $MIND could be integrated into gaming platforms, using its AI to optimize in-game decisions, trading assets, or even create unique in-game economies. Imagine being able to trade in-game assets based on AI predictions, just like how $MIND operates in crypto trading. The potential for this AI agent to scale across industries is enormous, making it a prime candidate for your next big investment. The Future of Gaming, AI, and Crypto Are Intertwining The world of gaming, AI, and crypto is on the verge of something massive. With Elon Musk’s xAI working to scale up its AI model for AAA games and launching a dedicated gaming studio, the intersection of these industries is becoming more tangible than ever. And with the rise of Mind of Pepe , there’s an exciting opportunity for investors to capitalize on this trend before it takes off. If you’re looking to diversify your portfolio with a project that combines the best of AI, gaming, and meme coins, $MIND is definitely worth keeping an eye on. So, whether you’re in it for the memes, the tech, or the potential profits, this crypto presale could be just the opportunity you’ve been waiting for.

In fact, data from FarSide shows that February has been a particularly negative month for BTC ETFs, with withdrawals dominating most days. BTC ETFs See Mostly Outflows The launch of the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs in the States last January was received with open arms by investors as they rushed to transfer their funds out of the converted Grayscale Trust into other funds. Some even poured fresh capital into BlackRock’s IBIT, Fidelity’s FBTC, and others. The summer was lethargic, with not a lot of action to report. The landscape truly changed after the US election as the promise for a friendlier regulatory environment turned the tables around, and investors were quick to insert fresh funds into the ETFs. However, that mania seems to have disappeared. Whether it’s President Trump’s controversial behavior on topics ranging from tariffs to the war in Ukraine , investors have become significantly less bullish on BTC, which is evident from the inflows into the ETFs. February, typically regarded as a highly positive month in terms of bitcoin’s price performance, has seen only a handful of days with net inflows. In fact, there are only four such days this month: February 4, 5, 7, and 14. The past few weeks have been particularly painful for the financial vehicles tracking BTC’s performance. Just two out of the last 11 trading days were in the green, while withdrawals were recorded on all others. February 20 saw the biggest chunk of net outflows, with $364.8 million leaving the funds. Even IBIT, the world’s largest BTC ETF, registered $112 million in withdrawals. Since February 6, Bitcoin ETFs have marked $1.1 billion in net outflows, making February 2025 the worst month in this regard since the products’ inception over a year ago. And ETH? While not as bad as bitcoin’s situation, ETH also ended last week on the wrong foot. After four consecutive days of net inflows, the products tracking the second-largest cryptocurrency registered withdrawals worth $13.1 million on Thursday and $8.9 million on Friday. Their recent performance has been more promising than that of BTC. February is going well for the Ethereum ETFs , with only four days in the red for now. However, enthusiasm faded after February 4, when investors poured $307.8 million into the ETH ETFs. Since then, the financial products have seen only low double-digit inflows.

Table of Contents Can Chainlink continue its strategic ascent? Is Polkadot positioning for its next breakthrough? Why BitLemons is a game-changer Conclusion The cryptocurrency market is a battleground of innovation, where only the most transformative platforms survive and thrive. In this high-stakes arena, a new contender has emerged, promising to reshape the entire landscape of digital finance and online gaming. As traditional cryptocurrencies wrestle with market volatility, one platform stands out, offering investors a unique blend of technology, strategic tokenomics, and massive growth potential. Can Chainlink continue its strategic ascent? Chainlink is currently trading at $17.99, with a 2.43% increase over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has maintained a stable trajectory, with its oracle technology continuing to provide critical infrastructure for decentralized applications. The platform’s ability to connect smart contracts with real-world data remains a key differentiator in the rapidly evolving blockchain ecosystem. Over the past seven days, Chainlink has shown marginal volatility, with trading volumes reaching $277.93m and a market capitalization of $11.74b. The 7-day chart reveals a nuanced price movement, suggesting investor confidence and strategic positioning in the broader crypto market. Is Polkadot positioning for its next breakthrough? Polkadot presents an intriguing narrative of potential and innovation. Currently trading at $5.08, the cryptocurrency has exhibited a slight 0.62% decline in the past 24 hours. With a market capitalization of $7.88b and a circulating supply of 1.55b DOT, the platform continues to explore interoperability solutions. The 7-day chart for Polkadot reflects a recovering trend, with price movements indicating renewed market optimism. Volume and market dynamics suggest the cryptocurrency is finding its footing after previous market challenges.

The analysis compares the current situation with two historical cases where blockchain reversals were feasible. In 2010, Bitcoin successfully rolled back transactions when a bug created 184 billion BTC. The developer Tim Beiko stated that it was possible due to the network’s small size and clear protocol violation. Similarly, Ethereum’s 2016 The DAO hack recovery succeeded because the stolen funds were frozen for 30 days, allowing time for community coordination. ELI5 why we cannot ""rollback"" Ethereum? After yesterday's Bybit hack, crypto commentators are again asking why Ethereum cannot ""rollback"" the chain to reverse the hack. While experienced ecosystem actors near-unanimously agree that this is infeasible, it's worth breaking down… — timbeiko.eth (@TimBeiko) February 22, 2025 Beiko mentioned that the Bybit hack has fundamentally different challenges. The theft happened through a compromised multisig interface that made malicious transactions appear legitimate to signers. From Ethereum’s ( ETH ) perspective, these transactions followed all protocol rules, leaving no technical basis for intervention. You might also like: Bybit launches $140m bounty to track down crypto heist Attempt to reverse Bybit hack could cause disruption Beiko also pointed out that modern cryptocurrency infrastructure has also grown more complex. The stolen funds were immediately mobile and could be routed through decentralized exchanges, lending protocols, and cross-chain bridges. This interconnectedness means any attempt to reverse transactions would create disruption across the ecosystem. This could affect legitimate trades and settlements, he says. While Ethereum can still theoretically implement “irregular state changes” when funds are frozen and isolated, the last such proposal in 2018 faced strong opposition. That attempt aimed to recover 500,000 frozen ETH from a Parity wallet bug but was rejected due to concerns about centralization and precedent. The technical limitations have been further highlighted by recent developments. Crypto mixer platform eXch has rejected Bybit’s request for cooperation in tracking the stolen funds. SlowMist, a blockchain security firm, reports that hackers have already begun laundering the ETH through eXch, converting it to Bitcoin ( BTC ), Monero ( XMR ), and other cryptocurrencies. eXch, the coin mixer platform used by North Korean hackers, rejected Bybit's request for cooperation. SlowMist pointed out that eXch was involved in multiple security incidents, exposing the personal information of industry security personnel, and all platforms should improve… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 23, 2025 SlowMist’s founder warned that eXch has a history of hostile behavior toward security researchers and recommended exchanges increase risk controls for funds originating from the platform. The quick movement of assets through mixing services shows why technical solutions like rollbacks are no longer viable for major thefts in today’s crypto ecosystem.

The presale has already raised over $14.9 million, but the latest testnet upgrade might contribute to the growth. Experts even predict that this token could reach $5 by 2026. The presale tokens are currently available at $0.18, and after the launch, the price will automatically increase to $0.20. If this token reaches $5, as predicted, it could lead to massive profits for those who invested now. Best ICO: DTX Exchange’s Testnet Upgrade and Roadmap The DTX testnet upgrade is just the beginning of the hybrid exchange’s preparations for a major expansion in 2025. The roadmap outlines several key developments, including the launch of live trading functionality and the mainnet release on the VulcanX blockchain. The Phoenix Wallet will also be introduced on both Android and iOS. Additionally, the platform will be available in 41 countries, further expanding its reach. To ensure security on the platform, DTX Exchange will create bug bounty programs. To attract developers’ interest in the project, a Digi-Hackathon program will also be hosted. DTX is currently priced at $0.18, with an expected launch price of $0.20. It is expected to launch on the Ethereum network, with a total supply of 475 million tokens. As part of the tokenomics, 50% of the total supply is for the ongoing public presale. Will DTX Reach $5 by 2026? Investors are asking if the DTX token can achieve a $5 valuation by 2026. To do so, the token would need to see an increase in adoption and trading volume. Fortunately, the DTX Exchange offers several features that could drive demand. DTX Exchange was built for traders and investors who want to make massive profits. Many crypto exchanges offer leverage of 50x to 200x. On the other hand, DTX was developed for high-risk traders, allowing them to increase their trading capital by up to 1,000 times. Another exciting feature is fractional multi-asset trading. This enables users to invest in stocks, cryptocurrencies, and ETFs simultaneously. The automated investment manager then allows users to make small, long-term investments. At this exchange, beginners won’t have to worry about their trading strategies. There’s a copy trading feature where novices can copy the trade of pro traders. Besides these features, experts have broken down their $DTX predictions for the future. According to analysts, DTX could become one of the best ICO projects in the crypto market if it reaches $5. This project has a total supply of $475 million, and if the price hits $5, the total valuation will be over $2.3 billion. Most importantly, those who invested at $0.18 will record more than 2,677% profit. A predicted price growth like this is similar to that of Ethereum. When ETH was launched in 2015, it remained below $1 for most of the year. Then, one year later, on March 4, 2016, the price reached $10. The Role of the DTX Black Club in Growth One of the standout aspects of DTX Exchange is its exclusive Black Club. By buying this coin, members can access premium benefits like trading discounts, profit-sharing incentives, and governance rights. This is among the benefits of joining the best ICO projects. The DTX Black Club is divided into multiple tiers, including bronze, silver, gold, and platinum. At the bronze level, an investor must wager $10,000 to receive monthly bonuses and rakeback. At the silver level, a wager of $50 to $100K is required, but investors will receive added level-up bonuses. To join the gold DTX Black Club, you must make between $100k and $250k in wagers, while the platinum club requires between $250k and $1M. Creating this club could increase the trading volume and liquidity. Most importantly, it places its presale as one of the best ICO projects. Conclusion: Can $DTX Be the Best ICO Project? With the best ICO performance, a strong roadmap, and innovative trading features, DTX Exchange is attracting investors. The main net launch on the VulcanX blockchain and the expansion into 41 countries will contribute to further growth. Currently, DTX is available for $0.18 before officially launching at $0.20. According to analysts, the price could increase to $5 by 2026. Assuming this happens, investors could enjoy over 2,677% profits.

With artificial intelligence playing a bigger role in blockchain technology, certain AI tokens are showing promising potential that could outshine traditional meme coins. However, Institutional investors and crypto whales seeking the next investment opportunity to boost their portfolio have discovered FloppyPepe (FPPE) and other AI tokens that could outperform meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before Q2 2025. FloppyPepe (FPPE) To Lead The AI Token Sector As a top project in the AI token sector, FloppyPepe (FPPE) brings two groundbreaking AI agents to the table. The first is FloppyX , an advanced AI video generation framework that can automate video generation with real-time interaction capabilities. The second AI agent is the text-to-image generation system, which was recently launched on Telegram and is already generating buzz in the community. This swift development timeline, backed by a successfully passed SolidProof audit, demonstrates FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) commitment to delivering real utility. What sets FloppyPepe (FPPE) apart is its connection to Matt Furie’s creative legacy, which inspired the team to work with a top-tier artist to release regular hand-drawn pieces of FloppyPepe (FPPE) artwork, maintaining a crucial human touch alongside its AI innovations. The token’s growth potential is further strengthened by its advanced tokenomics. With a deflationary model featuring a 1% burn mechanism and a 1% redistribution to holders , FloppyPepe (FPPE) is designed for long-term value appreciation. Additionally, the private sale, which sold out within 24 hours, speaks volumes about investor confidence in the project. Looking at the broader AI token cryptocurrency sector (currently trackable on CoinMarketCap’s AI agents index), there is tremendous growth potential. As traditional industries increasingly adopt AI solutions, tokens that facilitate this integration are positioned for substantial gains. Therefore, FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) entry into this sector, combined with its rapidly growing Telegram and X (formerly Twitter) communities, suggests it could outperform popular meme coins such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). In addition, the project’s stage-based pricing structure rewards early investors, creating an opportunity for those who missed out on Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) and Dogecoin’s (DOGE) initial surge. With AI agents projected to reform various industries through advanced technological applications, FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) dual AI agent approach puts it at the forefront of this transformation. When compared to large-cap AI agent cryptocurrencies, FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) growth potential becomes even more apparent. The project’s innovative use cases, strong community foundation, and ongoing token presale at a very low price of $0.0000002 have created significant buzz, suggesting it could be positioned for substantial gains before Q2 2025. Why Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) May Struggle to Keep Up With AI tokens While Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have strong community support and viral appeal, they lack fundamental utility compared to AI tokens. Their growth is primarily fueled by hype, celebrity endorsements, and speculative trading rather than technological innovation or real-world applications. With the rise of AI agent cryptocurrencies, investors may shift their focus toward utility-based tokens that offer long-term value and real-world adoption, potentially leaving meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) behind. Why AI Tokens Like FloppyPepe (FPPE) Could Outperform Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) While Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have enjoyed massive success as meme coins, their reliance on community hype and speculative trading leaves them vulnerable to market volatility. In contrast, FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) integration of AI technology provides a unique value proposition that goes beyond memes and speculation. By offering real-world utility through its AI agents, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is positioned to attract a broader audience, including tech enthusiasts, content creators, and investors looking for innovative projects. And finally, With its dual AI agents, deflationary tokenomics, and connection to established meme culture, FloppyPepe (FPPE) could outperform traditional meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB Join the FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale and community: Website: https://floppypepe.io/ Whitepaper: https://floppypepe.gitbook.io/floppypepe.io Telegram: https://t.me/floppypepeofficial X (Twitter): https://x.com/floppypepe The post Top AI Tokens That Could Outperform Shiba Inu (SHIB) And Dogecoin (DOGE) Before Q2 2025 appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",Token Presale and ICO Insights|FloppyPepe,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'The Coin Rise', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecoinrise,2025-02-23 14:00:45

While some tokens ride on speculation, others bring innovation, real utility, and massive potential. A crypto veteran has raised concerns about the Dogecoin price’s ability to maintain momentum, while WallitIQ (WLTQ) is making waves with its cutting-edge technology and explosive growth potential . WallitIQ (WLTQ): The Future Of Crypto Wallets, Set For A 250x Climb Analysts and crypto veterans are eyeing WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) massive upside potential, with projections pointing to a 250x surge .

The Ethereum-based AI solves critical industry problems with AI-powered security, efficient transaction management, and exclusive benefits for token holders. Furthermore, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is gearing up for its beta platform launch , a key milestone that will introduce users to its next-gen decentralized wallet ecosystem.

WallitIQ (WLTQ) holders enjoy unmatched benefits, from lower transaction fees to governance participation. The ability to trade over 1,000 cryptocurrencies directly from the wallet makes it an indispensable tool in the digital asset space.

This enticing offer captures investors’ interest and positions the AI altcoin as a more appealing investment alternative amid concerns that the Dogecoin price may struggle in the upcoming bull run. Dogecoin Price: Adapting To Evolving Market Demands The Dogecoin price has exhibited significant volatility, prompting serious investors to reassess its long-term potential as the market evolves. Despite boasting a dedicated community, the Dogecoin price is hindered by the absence of substantial upgrades and real-world applications, rendering it vulnerable in an innovation-driven market. According to a seasoned crypto expert, the Dogecoin price may struggle to keep pace with the next bull run without groundbreaking developments. The token’s value remains heavily reliant on hype and external endorsements rather than intrinsic worth, making it susceptible to sharp declines when market sentiment shifts. Unlike projects that bring advanced solutions, the Dogecoin price lacks the support of scalability improvements, security upgrades, and staking incentives. While short-term spikes may occur, long-term holders may find themselves at a disadvantage as smarter investments such as WallitIQ (WLTQ) take center stage. Conclusion: WallitIQ (WLTQ) Is The Top Investment Choice Opportunities like this don’t come often. The crypto market is shifting, and smart money is already flowing into WallitIQ (WLTQ). With a 250x climb projected, the presale presents a rare chance to secure early-stage gains before the price surges. As the Dogecoin price remains uncertain, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is rapidly positioning itself as the go-to asset for the next bull run. This is more than just another project; it’s a chance to be part of the next major wave in crypto. Get in before the next round and watch the investment grow!

The discussion, titled ""Together Against Industry Crisis, Is There a Best Solution for the Security of the Crypto Industry?"" featured insights from leading security firms SlowMist and GoPlus Security, as well as prominent KOLs. Security: A Top Priority for HTX Sun stressed that security is a ""top priority"", demanding constant vigilance and learning. He illustrated how hacker tactics have evolved, from early hot wallet attacks to more sophisticated multi-signature wallet breaches, and declared that exchanges must continuously enhance their security protocol. Sun emphasized that security is like personal health management, requiring internal efforts and a proactive approach. HTX has implemented multi-device login, remote login alerts, abnormal transfer alerts, and other security features, and has publicly disclosed Merkle Tree Proof of Reserve (PoR) for 28 consecutive months, maintaining reserve ratios exceeding 100%. Sun's Influence on Security Practices Across the Crypto Landscape Sun's commitment to security extends to his vision for HTX and his influential role in shaping security practices across the broader crypto landscape. He believes that the principle of security is considered fundamental to every business and product. He cited the early implementation of native multi-signature functionality in TRON as a successful example of proactive security design, demonstrating his commitment to building security into the foundation of his projects. He also highlighted the recent launch of USDD 2.0, emphasizing the deep understanding of stablecoin security risks that informed its development. ""Just as exchanges should strengthen security mechanisms from the source in system design and operation, to maximize the prevention of security incidents,"" Sun stated. Sun also revealed that HTX collaborates with numerous white hat teams to conduct continuous penetration testing, security drills, and vulnerability mining. The platform actively monitors global cryptocurrency security incidents and studies hacker attack principles and methods for effective prevention. Addressing the Situation and Industry Cooperation Regarding the controversy surrounding CZ's suggestion for the affected exchange to suspend withdrawals, Sun acknowledged the validity of the advice from an exchange perspective. He explained that the initial hours after a security breach are crucial for investigating the issue and ensuring safety. While suspending withdrawals is necessary to eliminate risks, the suspension period should be minimized to reduce user impact. Sun called for closer cooperation between exchanges, security agencies, and the community to jointly address hacker threats, promote technological sharing, security innovation, and information exchange, and promote the healthy and sustainable development of the industry. HTX's Commitment to User Safety HTX demonstrates its commitment to security through a proactive and continuously improving approach. The platform's multi-faceted security strategy encompasses collaboration with leading security experts, rigorous ongoing monitoring, robust internal protocols, and a focus on enhancing multi-signature support, security alerts, and mitigating emerging threats such as hashtag scams.

40735537,https://timestabloid.com/?p=58300,1740322600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple Set to Replace SWIFT? This New List Sparks Speculation,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-set-to-replace-swift-this-new-list-sparks-speculation/,"A recent tweet by crypto influencer Amelie has ignited discussions in the digital asset community regarding Ripple’s potential role in the global financial system. The tweet , which references a video by financial analyst Paul Barron, suggests that Ripple’s involvement in the Faster Payments Council (FPC) could indicate a move toward replacing SWIFT as the dominant cross-border payments network. Barron highlights key figures from Ripple linked to the FPC, a body focused on enhancing payment efficiency and innovation. He mentions James Selleck and Ryan Zagonne, both associated with Ripple, appearing in documents related to the Faster Payments Task Force. This revelation has led to renewed speculation about Ripple’s growing influence in shaping the future of financial transactions. WOW! IS RIPPLE ABOUT TO REPLACE SWIFT? PAUL BARRON EXPLAINS: IF YOU LOOK IN THE BOARD & THE MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT ENTITY „FASTER PAYMENTS COUNCIL“ RIPPLE IS LISTED THERE! #XRP SWIFT pic.twitter.com/FLsM2WhQw7 — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) February 21, 2025 Ripple’s Presence in the Faster Payments Council The Faster Payments Council is a collaborative organization aimed at improving the speed and efficiency of payments in the United States and beyond. It includes financial institutions, payment providers, and technology companies working together to advance payment solutions. Ripple’s involvement in this initiative suggests that blockchain technology is gaining increased recognition in mainstream financial circles. Paul Barron emphasizes that Ripple’s inclusion in the FPC is significant because few blockchain-focused companies are in such regulatory and advisory bodies. He notes that Ripple has maintained a longstanding focus on cross-border payments , traditionally dominated by SWIFT. The presence of Ripple representatives in such influential payment discussions reinforces the idea that the company is positioning itself as a key player in the evolving financial landscape. Comparisons Between Ripple and SWIFT SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) has been the backbone of cross-border banking transactions for over four decades. However, its reliance on legacy infrastructure has led to inefficiencies, such as high costs and slow processing times. Ripple, on the other hand, leverages blockchain technology to facilitate near-instant settlements with reduced fees. Paul Barron argues that Ripple could serve as a modern alternative to SWIFT, offering a more efficient and transparent system for global transactions. He suggests that Ripple’s continued integration into financial frameworks, such as the Faster Payments Council, indicates a growing acceptance of blockchain-based solutions by regulators and industry leaders. Implications for the Future of Cross-Border Payments While speculation about Ripple replacing SWIFT is not new, its ongoing collaboration with regulatory and financial organizations strengthens its credibility as a transformative force. The Faster Payments Council’s recognition of Ripple suggests that blockchain technology is increasingly embedded in financial infrastructure. However, challenges remain. SWIFT continues to maintain strong partnerships with major banks and financial institutions worldwide. Additionally, regulatory scrutiny surrounding digital assets, including Ripple’s ongoing legal challenges , could impact its broader adoption. Despite these challenges, Ripple’s involvement in the Faster Payments Council demonstrates its increasing influence in shaping the future of payments. As blockchain technology gains more acceptance in traditional financial systems, Ripple’s role in facilitating fast and cost-effective transactions would expand.

Ethereum ( ETH ) traded at $2,795 on Sunday, a few points above last Friday’s low of $2,665. It remains about 32% below the highest level in December last year. Coinglass data shows that Ethereum balances on Bybit have started rising after crashing on Friday following the hack. Balances rose to over 200,000 or $558 million, up from last Friday’s low of 61,000. Bybit ETH balances | Source: CoinGlass You might also like: Lazarus Group identified in $1.5b Bybit hack: Arkham There are two potential reasons for the ongoing Ethereum balances on Bybit. First, there is a likelihood that Bybit is actively buying ETH from the market as it seeks to boost confidence with its users. Second, the ongoing rise is a sign that customers are transferring ETH to the exchange as confidence rises. That’s because Bybit has maintained that it will cover 100% of the stolen Ethereum coins. Bybit has also launched a $140 million to track down the funds, a move that may see part of them returned. These events are happening after North Korea’s Lazarus Group allegedly accessed Bybit’s cold wallets and stole ETH tokens worth $1.4 billion. In addition to its scale, this hack raised concerns about the safety of crypto assets stored in cold wallets, by exchanges. Ethereum price may be at risk of a bigger dive ETH price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Ethereum may be at risk of a bigger dive in the near term. It has already formed a death cross pattern as the 200-day and 50-day weighted moving averages crossed each other. It is one of the most bearish chart patterns in technical analysis. Ethereum price has also formed a bearish flag chart pattern, a popular continuation sign. This pattern is made up of a vertical line and a consolidation. This consolidation also resembles a rising wedge pattern. Therefore, the ETH token will likely have a bearish breakdown, with the next reference level being at $2,155, the lowest point this year, which is about 23% below the current level. The bullish outlook will become invalid if the coin jumps above the 200-day WMA point at $3,085.

With a decentralized lending model and growing investor interest, it presents a unique opportunity for early adopters. Currently available at just $0.01, Mutuum Finance has already raised over $1 million in its presale, with 95% of Phase 1 tokens sold. As demand surges, investors are securing their positions before the price increases, anticipating strong long-term growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance introduces a decentralized lending system that eliminates intermediaries, allowing users to lend and borrow digital assets seamlessly. Those supplying liquidity earn passive income, while borrowers gain access to funds without selling their holdings. This structure ensures liquidity remains available and creates consistent demand for MUTM tokens. The platform offers two lending models: peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P). The P2C model allows users to deposit assets into liquidity pools and earn interest based on borrower activity, ensuring capital efficiency. Meanwhile, the P2P model offers flexibility, enabling lenders and borrowers to set terms directly. Both options provide competitive rates based on supply and demand, making Mutuum Finance a compelling alternative to traditional lending solutions. Mutuum Finance is integrating an overcollateralized stablecoin to enhance liquidity and minimize volatility within its ecosystem. Unlike centralized alternatives, this stablecoin is backed by on-chain assets, ensuring that every token in circulation is fully collateralized. Users can mint the stablecoin by depositing collateral, and when loans are repaid or liquidated, the supply is adjusted to maintain stability. This stablecoin serves as a reliable borrowing option while maintaining a secure and transparent financial structure. By offering a decentralized alternative to stable-value assets, Mutuum Finance is solidifying its position as a long-term player in the DeFi space. To maintain steady token demand, Mutuum Finance has implemented a buy-and-distribute mechanism. A portion of platform revenue is used to repurchase MUTM tokens, which are then distributed to mtToken stakers. This approach fosters long-term holding, reduces sell pressure, and creates sustained buy demand, reinforcing price stability and benefiting active participants in the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance’s presale is rapidly approaching full subscription, having raised over $1 million in under two weeks. With 95% of Phase 1 tokens already sold, early buyers are locking in their positions at $0.01 before the price rises to $0.015 in the next phase. This accelerating demand reflects growing investor confidence, as many recognize the opportunity to enter before exchange listings further drive value. The limited presale supply and strong institutional and retail backing indicate that MUTM’s price at launch could significantly exceed its initial listing. Analysts forecast that with its expanding ecosystem and upcoming exchange support, the token could reach $1 or higher, offering substantial returns for early investors. Mutuum Finance’s roadmap emphasizes sustained development and market expansion. The platform’s beta version is expected to launch alongside the token’s exchange debut, ensuring immediate usability for holders. Ongoing discussions for listings on major exchanges are further strengthening its market position, increasing accessibility, and expanding adoption. With its robust fundamentals, growing investor interest, and an innovative financial model, Mutuum Finance is emerging as a key player in the next bull market. While XRP remains a leading force in cross-border payments, MUTM is carving its own path in decentralized lending, offering an attractive investment opportunity for those seeking both short-term gains and long-term growth.

Though others are asking if the largest increases have already passed, regardless investors are thrilled. XRP has been working hard, but DTX Exchange is growingly popular among crypto enthusiasts. This presale project just entered its bonus stage, and the hype is real. With a fair launch, no VC dominance, and a platform that lets users trade crypto, stocks, and forex seamlessly, DTX is making headlines. As money shifts in the crypto market, could this be the next big altcoin to explode past $10? Ripple’s Wild Ride: Is XRP Ready for More Growth? Lately, Ripple has been on an amazing trip. The native token, XRP, has surged more than 200% in the last two weeks. One of the trendiest altcoins available right now, big news has driven the price higher. Ripple has always been known for staying strong, and this latest surge came after President Trump talked about a possible tax break for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. This news could signal big institutional interest, and investors are all over it, seeing Ripple as a top contender. Source: CoinMarketCap Ripple’s XRP has proven to be one of the most volatile and rewarding cryptos to hold. The recent rally has pushed XRP above $1.10, after several years of stagnation. Ripple has shown its resilience, defying expectations and pulling in both institutional and retail investors. Even with recent surges, many believe Ripple could continue to rise further. As the token is slowly gaining ground again, investors are starting to ask themselves, what’s next for Ripple? Can it keep this pace, or is there a risk of a pullback? While the token continues to make waves in the crypto market, another token is silently catching up. With its sold out presale, DTX Exchange is a potent new platform creating solid headlines. Unlike Ripple, DTX is positioned to present a revolutionary trading platform for several assets, including stocks, crypto, forex, and ETFs. Already bringing in over $14.8 million, the DTX sold-out presale is drawing more investors daily. DTX distinguishes itself in the sense that it allows traders to employ up to 1000x leverage. Don’t miss out on this exciting opportunity before it hits $10. DTX Exchange Shows Potential to Hit $10 Before XRP DTX Exchange is making waves in crypto, and it’s easy to see why. One of its biggest strengths is the VulcanX blockchain, which can handle over 200,000 transactions per second. That’s far faster than platforms like Ripple, which lags behind in transaction speed. Faster transactions mean lower fees and a seamless trading experience, making DTX an attractive choice for traders looking for efficiency and scalability. What sets DTX Exchange apart is its accessibility. While many platforms require large deposits, DTX allows traders to start with just $100. Even more impressive, users can access 1000x leverage, meaning a $100 deposit can control $100,000 in trades. This gives traders an opportunity to maximize their gains, making DTX a serious contender for those chasing high returns. XRP has already proven itself in the market, but DTX Exchange is shaping up to be the next breakout token. With a fair launch, cutting-edge technology, and growing momentum, many investors believe it could outpace XRP in the near future. As demand surges and its sold-out presale, the question now is whether DTX will hit $10 before XRP does. Unlike many new tokens, DTX Exchange is built for sustained growth. It isn’t just riding on hype, it has real utility, security, and a growing ecosystem. The VulcanX blockchain ensures scalability and efficiency, meaning that as adoption grows, DTX can handle massive trading volumes without delays. This puts it in a prime position to see major price increases post-launch. With its final bonus stage, DTX Exchange presents a rare opportunity for early investors. Given its strong fundamentals, high-speed transactions, and massive leverage potential, the race to $10 is closer than ever. The real question isn’t if DTX will hit $10; it’s whether it will get there before XRP.

Amidst much uncertainty in the crypto market, the altcoin has experienced a major dual price trend in February resulting in a price change of <1% in this period. Following recent developments, the BNB market is in a precarious position hinting at a possible price slide. Related Reading: BNB Price Approaches a Key Level—Can It Clear the Hurdle? BNB Deviation Could Trigger A Drop To $380 Or Lower In an X post on Saturday, crypto analyst Ali Martinez provided valuable insight into the Binance Coin price structure. During a price rally in mid-February, BNB rose by over 34%, breaking past the $720 resistance zone to reach a local peak of $723. However, the asset failed to hold above $720 and has since dipped as low as $650. Following this price pattern, Martinez postulates that if BNB is displaying a deviation, the altcoin could soon experience significant losses. For context, a deviation occurs when an asset’s price breaks above a key resistance level but fails to sustain this move reversing back into its previous price range. A deviation can indicate a market strength suggesting a lack of momentum in the absence of a clear price breakout. According to Martinez, if the Binance Coin is undergoing a deviation, market prices are likely to plummet with initial support zones set around $505. However, the first major support level for BNB bulls would be at $380, which represents the midpoint of the asset’s current parallel trading channel. Notably, in the presence of strong selling pressure, likely due to expectations for BNB to complete a range-bound movement, the token could fall to as low as $214 representing a potential 73% decline from current market prices. To invalidate this bearish sentiment, BNB would need to quickly reclaim $720, which would suggest sufficient buying momentum to sustain an uptrend. Related Reading: Crypto CEO Calls Start Of The Altcoin Season With A Caveat BNB Price Overview At the time of writing, Binance Coin exchanges hands at $668 after a 3.43% price increase in the past day. As earlier stated, weekly gains stand at 1.78% reducing the overall decline in the past 30 days to 3.13%. According to its daily chart, BNB’s price has failed to break above its 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) suggesting a downtrend in the short term. However, the asset’s Relative Strength Index is at 54.40 and heading upwards indicating potential for some immediate price growth before entering the overbought zone (70). With a market cap of $95.22 billion, BNB is ranked as the fifth largest cryptocurrency in the crypto market.

The attack, which resulted in the theft of approximately $1.5 billion worth of ETH, took an unexpected turn when the attacker used unconventional methods to move the funds. According to ZachXBT, one of the wallets associated with the hacker, 5STkQy…95T7Cq, transferred 60 SOL to another address called 9Gu8v6…aAdqWS. This wallet then launched a memecoin called QinShihuang (500000), which shockingly achieved a trading volume of over $26 million. ZachXBT highlighted the incident, saying, “As if this year couldn’t get any weirder, there’s a wallet that laundered money from the Bybit hack and released a memecoin via PumpFun.” Tracing the attacker’s movements, ZachXBT detailed how the funds from the Bybit attack were transferred across multiple blockchain networks. On February 22, the attacker moved $1.08 million to the 0x363908df2b0890e7e5c1e403935133094287d7d1 wallet, which then bridged USDC to the Solana network. Related News: Analytics Company Evaluates New Developing Signal in Its Special Metric, Predicts Bitcoin Price's Course in the Coming Days The EFmqz8PTTShNsEsErMUFt9ZZx8CTZHz4orUhdz8Bdq2 wallet bridged all USDC from Solana to Binance Smart Chain (BSC), distributing the funds across two addresses. These BSC wallets split the USDC into over 30 different addresses before merging it into 0x0be9ab85f399a15ed5e8cbe5859f7a882c7b55a3. Wallet 0x0be9 then distributed 106,000 USDC to ten BSC addresses before bridging it back to ten Solana addresses. ZachXBT noted that some of these addresses were “scrubbed by memecoin scammers,” meaning small amounts of tokens were sent to these addresses to establish transaction connections. The launderer then exchanged the memecoins for SOL, further complicating tracking efforts. In response to the situation, PumpFun has removed the Lazarus-related memecoin from its frontend in an effort to prevent further illegal activity. *This is not investment advice.

The Dubai-based company said that hackers managed to steal $1.5B worth of digital currency. The attack, which was apparently carried out by North Korea’s Lazarus Group, was a highly sophisticated one. Perpetrators were able to intercept a transaction taking place from the exchange’s cold wallet to the warm one. They manipulated the transaction’s signing interface and quickly diverted 401,000 $ETH to an unidentified address. Ironically, the breach affected Bybit’s cold wallet, which was designed to be extra secure. Quite naturally, a cybercrime of this magnitude caused a stir in the larger crypto market. Ethereum fell by nearly 7%, whereas Bitcoin fell by 3%. Both the cryptos have, however, recovered at the time of writing. Bybit CEO Offers Assurance As news of the Bybit hack surfaced, customers flocked to withdraw their funds from the platform. The company is reportedly facing a ‘bank run’ worth $4B. Ben Zhou, the CEO of Bybit, took to X to assure users about the firm’s capability to let users withdraw funds. 12 hr from the worst hack in history. ALL withdraws have been processed. Our withdraw system is now fully back to normal pace, you can withdraw any amount and experience no delays. — Ben Zhou (@benbybit) February 22, 2025 Even though Bybit has promised users that their funds are safe and that the company is fully capable of refunding anyone affected by the hack, it doesn’t wash away its culpability, let alone the fear this has instilled in everyday crypto users like you and me. Increasing Cybersecurity Risks in Crypto According to a report from Chainalysis , a total of $2.2B was stolen from crypto platforms in 2024. This makes it the fifth year in the past decade that saw crypto losses exceed the $1B mark. It also tells us just how astronomically large Bybit’s $1.5B figure is. Not only is the amount huge, but this is Bybit we’re talking about. Cybercriminals being able to access a crypto exchange with over 60M users and $36B in daily trading volume raises serious questions about the industry’s security benchmarks. Moreover – and seasoned crypto players would know this – cybersecurity in crypto has been a long-drawn issue. For instance, $350M was stolen from crypto exchange Mt Gox in 2014, $611M from Poly Network in 2021, and $570M from Binance in 2022. Times like these remind us that any amount of innovation in DeFi or AI would be of little use if the foundation of privacy isn’t kept intact. Enter Best Wallet Token ($BEST) . Best Wallet Redefines Crypto Security Best Wallet is a non-custodial crypto wallet , meaning you get full control over your secret passkey. This eliminates the privacy scares that could’ve been possible if you had stored your funds in centralized exchanges like Bybit. Simply put, no one has access to your crypto but you. It’s also the first crypto wallet to use Fireblock’s MPC-CMP wallet technology, which involves advanced cryptographic techniques. Combined with the option to enable 2FA or use your biometrics for more seamless security, Best Wallet makes it nearly impossible for a malicious third party to gain access to your funds. Best Wallet also provides third-party crypto insurance against hacking and phishing attacks. So, in the unfortunate scenario your funds are permanently lost in a cyberattack, Best Wallet will see to it that you’re made whole. In addition to being the most secure crypto wallet out there, Best Wallet has also got other tricks up its sleeves. For instance, it allows you to directly buy top meme coins that are in presale. By getting in when the token is at its cheapest, you stand to make enormous yields. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – The Best Altcoin to Buy In 2025 With Best Wallet allowing users to reclaim their privacy, its native cryptocurrency, $BEST , finds itself in a pole position to benefit from the wallet’s growth. Best Wallet, for instance, aims to capture 40% of the non-custodial crypto wallet market by 2026. Going by its continually inflating user base (currently at 500K+), this looks easily achievable. Also, Best Wallet Token holders will unlock special perks within the Best Wallet ecosystem. They’ll be able to carry out transactions at lower rates, for instance. What’s more, they’ll also get higher staking rewards and priority access to the best crypto presales . The $BEST presale , on the back of Best Wallet’s revolutionary security settings, is progressing at the rate of knots. It has so far raised a staggering $10M. You can get in now for just $0.0241 per token. But hurry up because prices increase in the next few hours.

The firm’s analysts believe that this could be achieved by creating a one million Bitcoin reserve over the next five years. VanEck’s Estimate According to the asset management company, a U.S. BTC reserve could slash the national debt if the crypto’s price increases to $21 million by 2049. This would represent around 18% of the total U.S. debt at that time. “If the U.S. government follows the BITCOIN Act’s proposed path – accumulating 1 million BTC by 2029 – our analysis suggests this reserve could offset around $21 trillion of national debt by 2049,” said the institution’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, in its latest report . VanEck’s estimate assumes that the cryptocurrency’s price will increase at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25%, rising from $100,000 to $21 million per BTC in the next 24 years, while the country’s national debt climbs at 5% CAGR from $36 trillion at the start of 2025 to $116 trillion over the same period. The prediction aligns with the BITCOIN Act proposed by Senator Cynthia Lummis. Reacting to VanEck’s proposal, the lawmaker posted on X, “Good idea.” The Republican has been a vocal supporter of the idea of a U.S. BTC reserve. She has previously advocated for the initiative as a strategy to address the $36 trillion national debt and bolster the U.S. dollar’s global standing. She argues that the asset’s rising value could help reduce the debt over the next 20 years. Lummis believes establishing this concept would correct past financial missteps and ease economic pressure on younger generations. However, the legislation that would facilitate the creation of the stockpile is yet to be reviewed by the Senate or House. Growing Popularity Among Nations Following in the footsteps of President Donald Trump, the concept of a BTC stockpile is gaining international attention, and several governments are actively considering its potential use. In Venezuela, opposition leader María Corina Machado supports incorporating the cryptocurrency into the country’s supply, arguing that it could help recover stolen wealth and provide aid to its most vulnerable citizens. Switzerland is also exploring this possibility, with its National Bank evaluating the coin’s utility as a backup asset alongside gold. Similarly, Hong Kong’s legislator Wu Jiezhuang proposed integrating Bitcoin into the country’s financial reserves in December to enhance economic resilience. However, not everyone supports the idea. Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes recently dismissed it as an impractical strategy that would serve political interests rather than ensure financial stability.

The broader crypto market took another hit yesterday, causing top assets like Dogecoin (DOGE) to experience significant declines. Dogecoin's Latest Price Action For context, the price of Dogecoin surged to a daily high of $0.2606 on February 21, 2025, following reports that the SEC dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase. While the industry was still celebrating this feat, Bybit confirmed it was hacked to the tune of $1.46 billion worth of ERC-20 tokens. Subsequent reports showed that North Korea’s Lazarus Group perpetrated this devastating attack. As expected, the report spread panic across the industry, with many investors taking to safety by selling volatile cryptos for stablecoins. This caused DOGE to slump to $0.2351, marking a 9.78% decline from its peak price of $0.2606, registered on February 21. At press time, DOGE has rebounded slightly to $0.2442 per token. Nonetheless, the token is still down 3.74% in the past 24 hours and 11.6% over the past week. DOGEUSDT 2025 02 22 08 44 19 Investors remain confident in Dogecoin’s potential, undeterred by the latest dip and optimistic about a future rally. Some even project that Dogecoin could clinch half of Bitcoin’s market cap in the future. This optimism stems from positive updates relating to Dogecoin, including the growing institutional interest in DOGE as reflected in the multiple filings for a spot ETF tied to the token. Dogecoin Price If It Captures 50% of Bitcoin’s Market Cap Based on this speculation, we estimated how much DOGE could trade if it captured half of Bitcoin’s current valuation. Dogecoin currently sits on a market cap of $36.16 billion, positioning it as the eighth biggest cryptocurrency globally. In comparison, Bitcoin ranks as the world’s largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $1.9 trillion. Notably, half of Bitcoin’s market cap is $950 billion. Therefore, if Dogecoin captures half of Bitcoin’s current market cap, it will have a valuation of $950 billion. To attain this feat, Dogecoin must soar 2,527% from its current valuation of $36.16 billion. A $950 billion market cap for Dogecoin will take its price to $6.4151. It bears mentioning that this analysis assumes that Dogecoin does not experience significant changes to its circulating supply, which currently stands at 148.14 billion DOGE. DOGE to $6 Predictions Interestingly, several experts believe the $6 target is possible for Dogecoin. According to pseudonymous analyst Doge Lord, Dogecoin will soar to the $6 target this year. However, experts at Changelly believe it could take much longer, estimating a timeframe between 2035 - 2039. Meanwhile, the top prediction platform Telegaon suggests that Dogecoin will hit the $6 target by 2028, three years from now. The platform set DOGE’s minimum and maximum targets for 2028 at $5.72 and $9.12, respectively. Despite the optimism surrounding these projections, there is a need for caution, given the volatile nature of cryptos.",Market|Dogecoin Price Prediction|Latest Dogecoin (DOGE) News Today,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-02-23 15:21:35

The analyst also revealed key breakout levels for XRP as it eyes a rally to the ambitious price target. Key Breakout Levels As XRP Price Eyes Rally To $60 In an X post , crypto analyst Egrag Crypto highlighted $3, $6.4, $8, $13, and $27 as key breakout levels as the XRP price eyes a rally to $60. The analyst remarked that the range between $33 and $60 was a long-term target based on the channel projection he highlighted in his accompanying chart. The crypto analyst outlined a bullish scenario in which the XRP price could rally to as high as $67. He stated that a monthly close above $3 would validate further upside. Egrag Crypto added that a breakout from Fib 1.618 at $6.4 would lead to the second Fib extension, which starts with $8, $13, $27, and $67 as of Fib 1.888. This prediction aligns with his recent analysis in which he predicted that XRP could hit a $3.4 trillion market cap. Short-Term Outlook For The Crypto Egrag Crypto also predicted that the XRP price could rally to between $4 and $6 in the short term. The analyst noted that XRP’s current price action is showing a strong bullish move but facing resistance at the red horizontal zone on the accompanying chart. He further remarked that the red resistance line at $3 represents a critical level from the previous all-time highs (ATHs). The analyst added that a monthly close above this level could confirm a breakout toward the next Fibonacci extension targets, which are Fib 1.414 and Fib 1.1618, and price targets between $4.3 and $6.4, respectively. Based on this, Egrag Crypto stated that the upside targets are between $4.3 and $6, which are also the next significant resistance zones. A Bearish Scenario For XRP Egrag Crypto also outlined a bearish scenario for the XRP price. He stated that a rejection at $3 could lead to a pullback towards $1.90 and $2, which acted as support from the previous bullish candles. The analyst added that a break below $1.90 could shift sentiment to bearish, introducing downward risks toward the $0.90 and $1 range. Egrag Crypto claimed that a drop to this level would signal a potential Black Swan event across all markets. According to him, such a collapse would be a challenging prelude before the ignition stage for the XRP price. He then raised the possibility of the upcoming fort knox audit as a potential catalyst for this market crash. The Bybit hack , which led to a loss of $1.4 billion in ETH, threatened to be a Black Swan event, as the crypto market crashed following it. However, the market has recovered impressively following the hack.

In a new strategy session, Cowen tells his 874,000 YouTube subscribers that judging by previous cycles, altcoins likely have another leg to move down sometime during Q3 of movement as their movements are largely coupled with the price action of Bitcoin ( BTC ). He says that around November is when altcoins can mount their recovery. “I think at some point this year, [altcoins are] probably going to break down… And maybe [they’ll] do that this summer and then we’ll see them sort of bounce back up later on this year, something like where they come down here and then maybe go up. Remember, [the] big move by alt/Bitcoin pairs in 2017 didn’t actually occur until November so you have to remember that.” Cowen’s chart, which examines TOTAL3 – an index that tracks the total value of all digital assets excluding Bitcoin, Ethereum ( ETH ) and stablecoins – appears to suggest that it will fall below the 0.27 line when paired against BTC. TOTAL3/BTC is currently sitting at 0.47. In previous cycles when TOTAL3/BTC touched the 0.27 area, the altcoin market collapsed. Cowen goes on to say that the health of the altcoin market is largely dependent on BTC, and potentially the yields in 10-year Treasuries which often reflect investors’ general risk appetite. “If Bitcoin breaks up to a new cycle high, then I think Bitcoin would lead that move, so the altcoin markets’ fate in March is just dependent on Bitcoin. If Bitcoin goes up, they’ll go up too… If Bitcoin breaks down, I think it would probably correspond to maybe a surge in the long end of the yield curve, and that is something we’ve been tracking. If you actually look at the 10-year yield, one of the things that actually caused Bitcoin to sort of consolidate [previously] and then eventually break down was a surge of the 10-year yield.” Bitcoin is trading for $96,637 at time of writing, a 1.3% gain during the last day.

XRP whales purchased large amounts of tokens as altcoins flipped green. Institutional investors maintain their interest in XRP, citing cross-border solutions and a possible spot ETF approval in the United States. At press time, the total crypto market capitalization stood at $3.19 trillion. Whales Back XRP Growth In the last 24 hours, a group of whales scooped over $20 million worth of XRP, leading to an uptick in hourly trading volume. This follows similar trends in altcoins as bulls aim for a rebound before the end of the month, known for positive growth in altcoins. After a string of bullish activity, the asset ticked up 2% within hour,s taking down hourly numbers. However, these gains were short-lived because of the wider market downturn and the infamous Bybit scandal that wiped over $1.4 billion from the market. This week XRP holders showed enthusiasm after the approval of the first spot XRP ETF in Brazil sending positive signals to the United States market. Amid several applications for ETF products, crypto users rally behind XRP due to its institutional interests. According to Bitwise’s CEO, the chances of approval remain high. “ I would say two things on things up front… I think there’s substantial demand for an XRP ETF. XRP has had a sustained community for extremely long period of time. It’s an asset that trades significantly on centralized exchanges. I think people would love to find a way to hold it in a simple low-cost easy-to-use ETP structure. And I would say the second piece is the SEC much more receptive to discussion under the new administration than they were in the past.” Traders Move To Altcoins Amid Cycle Swing Upward momentum in XRP led to similar trading patterns in a slew of altcoins. This was also fueled by the CryptoQuant CEO’s view on an altcoin season. For Ki Young Ju, the altcoin season has started as stablecoin holders back the asset. Although there is no capital rotation, Young Ju stressed that BTC dominance doesn’t reflect the trend anymore as it’s a “selective alt season.” Ethereum price also ticked up in hourly trading, showing signs of a strong rebound when the market flips green.

On-chain investigator ZachXBT first exposed this, as per usual, confirming that the wallet involved (5STkQy…95T7Cq) sent exactly 60 SOL tokens to another wallet (9Gu8v6…aAdqWS) before launching half a million QinShihuang tokens. Within like three hours, these tokens were traded heavily, and transaction volume quickly topped $26 million. Zach traced the funds back clearly. He said the attackers moved $1.08 million USDC stolen from Bybit to wallet address 0x363908df2b0890e7e5c1e403935133094287d7d1 on February 22. The Bybit attackers bridged these funds from Ethereum onto the Solana blockchain, using wallet EFmqz8PTTShNsEsErMUFt9ZZx8CTZHz4orUhdz8Bdq2P. How Lazarus is pulling it off After that, Lazarus moved the USDC onto Binance Smart Chain (BSC), where Zach’s tracking showed that two separate wallets automatically split the stolen USDC across over thirty different addresses, breaking down the funds into smaller, harder-to-track transfers. Once split, Lazarus then recombined these smaller batches of funds into one wallet: 0x0be9ab85f399a15ed5e8cbe5859f7a882c7b55a3. Zach confirmed wallet 0x0be9 then split the funds some more, sending 106,000 USDC evenly across ten new wallets. Those ten wallets again bridged everything back over to Solana, completing a full blockchain cycle designed specifically to confuse blockchain trackers. Isn’t it just a little bit impressive? Zach also noticed something else weird. Many of these Solana addresses received tiny meme coin “dust” transactions from random scammers. Lazarus, instead of ignoring this dust, started actively swapping these meme coins back into SOL. They cleaned up the dirty SOL, mixed it around, and moved the funds through Pump Fun trades—exactly like with QinShihuang. Zach posted the addresses involved publicly—around 920 wallets—but removed specific wallets from tracking software interfaces to prevent Lazarus from quickly hiding tracks again. You can find them here . The stolen Bybit money then ended up on various crypto exchanges and swapping platforms, vanishing quietly behind legit-looking trades. Helius Labs CEO Mert commented directly on the risks, saying teams who build decentralized apps with no filters or protections are making a huge mistake. He compared crypto apps to email, where the underlying technology is neutral, but user-facing software—like Gmail—blocks known malicious actors. According to Mert, crypto apps must implement the same basic filtering if they know specific wallet addresses belong to criminal groups like Lazarus. Mert added clearly that he didn’t personally verify if Lazarus issued the coins directly, but he made his comments to warn developers in general about risks like these. Mert specifically questioned why Pump Fun didn’t blacklist wallets associated with Lazarus. With Pump Fun’s trading volume being so high, Lazarus easily bought coins on clean wallets, pumped prices high using stolen SOL, then sold everything off back into those clean wallets. Through simple pump-and-dump trading, Lazarus turned clearly traceable stolen crypto into clean, untraceable profits. Not Lazarus’s first rodeo Zach’s discoveries showed Lazarus has done this before. Some addresses from the current laundering scheme previously launched other meme tokens on Pump Fun. This means Lazarus has repeatedly exploited Pump Fun’s trading activity for money laundering. SlowMist, a security research firm, pointed out Lazarus used the crypto mixing platform eXch heavily. eXch directly refused to help when Bybit asked for cooperation. Instead, eXch posted the interception request from Bybit publicly and angrily rejected it. SlowMist explained clearly that eXch openly targets security personnel, exposing personal information online. They strongly urged crypto platforms to increase security measures against funds coming from eXch, which Lazarus regularly uses to convert stolen ETH into harder-to-trace cryptos like Bitcoin and Monero. Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of crypto exchange BitMEX, openly asked Vitalik Buterin on X if Ethereum might consider rolling back the blockchain to reverse the massive hack at Bybit, which resulted in around 400,000 ETH being stolen. Arthur’s post triggered immediate debate among crypto users. He doubled down, saying clearly that he believed Ethereum abandoned immutability after the 2016 DAO hack—when Ethereum developers reversed a $60 million theft using a controversial hard fork. Arthur said Ethereum “stopped being money” at that point. He argued openly if Ethereum did a rollback before, there shouldn’t be resistance to doing it again now to recover Bybit’s funds. Vitalik still hasn’t responded publicly to Arthur’s request. But many in the community are criticizing Arthur’s suggestion, with some even thinking he’s trolling Vitalik. Arthur’s tweet also reignited the debates about blockchain immutability, decentralization, and if rollbacks should ever happen again on major blockchains. Blockchain analysts explained clearly why Ethereum probably won’t consider a rollback now. Ethereum’s network currently uses an “account-based” model to store funds, just like regular banks. When Ethereum developers reversed the DAO hack, nodes upgraded software versions and moved ETH funds to new addresses. Today, reversing a similar hack would require massive consensus from Ethereum users, nodes, and developers—a consensus nearly impossible now. Something kind of similar happened with Bitcoin in 2019. Binance’s CEO Changpeng Zhao openly considered rolling back Bitcoin after hackers stole $40 million. He quickly changed his language from “rollback” to “re-org” due to backlash. Bitcoin’s miners and maxis rejected the idea strongly, criticizing any attempt to reverse transactions as a fundamental violation of decentralization principles. Ethereum’s community also rejected rollback ideas this time. But smaller blockchains have done rollbacks successfully in the past, typically after an attack. It’s rare, but not completely unheard of. Zach first announced the massive Bybit theft last Friday. He spotted suspicious on-chain activity involving over $1.47 billion quickly flowing out from Bybit. Zach watched the attackers rapidly swapping wrapped tokens like mETH and stETH into regular Ethereum tokens through decentralized exchanges, aggressively trying to obscure the stolen funds.

With digital currencies, one can make transactions with ease and even invest in projects that have the potential to increase in value. There are many investors who made quite a fortune when they invested in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). However, among the many cryptocurrencies in the market, these three have the potential to make investors rich: Bitcoin, Ripple (XRP) and ChowWow ($CHOW) . Every one of these digital currencies has their own specific features that make them unique. But whether you are looking to hold any of these for the long term or to seek new methods of generating huge revenues, these coins have something to offer. Let’s take a closer look at how BTC, XRP, and $CHOW can help on the road to riches. Bitcoin (BTC): Poised to Regain $100K Bitcoin is gradually approaching the much-desired price of $100,000. The first digital currency is now in close proximity to its horizontal resistance level. In the past two weeks, the bulls have failed to establish control over the price above the $98,000 level multiple times. The price of Bitcoin has not gone past the $100,000 mark since February 7th. This has raised some questions on whether or not the cryptocurrency has reached the peak of its rise already. However, large firms and even some nations are starting to accept the Bitcoin payment method. Therefore, purchasing Bitcoin at the current price level is a perfect way of creating long-term wealth. Ripple (XRP): Ready For A Breakout XRP is presently facing downward pressure, which has led to a decline of more than two per cent. This cryptocurrency is still being faced with significant resistance at the $2.65 and $2.80 levels. This implies that the price may remain volatile within these zones in the short run. If you invest at this price now, by the time the cryptocurrency price moves up, this will be a very huge profit-making season. In the case where XRP moves above $2.80, it could thus be an opportunity to create a potential cup and handle patterns on the daily chart. This could mean a bullish formation of a higher low if the pattern is to be validated. A breakout could thus lead to an increased bullish run within the subsequent few days or weeks. ChowWow ($CHOW): Offers A Low Barrier Entry On Its Presale ChowWow is still in the presale stage, and this enables investors looking for up-and-coming trending altcoins to expand their portfolios. Its presale token is at $0.008 in the current stage, which makes it the best crypto to invest in as this a cheap entry point. ChowWow has been developed with the community in mind and will include features such as airdrops that put it on the list of the most trending altcoins. The ChowWow token will be deflationary, which means that the supply of ChowWow will decline over time; this will be achieved through features such as burning and buying back tokens. Therefore, many investors flock to this new crypto ICO for long-term financial gains because the firm sets its barrier to entry low with a minimum investment. ChowWow is equipped with a play-to-earn gaming platform and the games are accessible to players; however, players who want to participate and earn play-to-earn rewards will have to hold $CHOW tokens. A part of the $CHOW gained from in-game sales is flowing back into the pool of rewards with the aim of redistributing it to the players which makes it the best crypto to invest in. Furthermore, ChowWow set aside 10% of each token for gaming rewards which ensures the game is more stable and sustainable in the earlier stages. Conclusion Cryptocurrencies have opened new doors for those looking to build wealth. Bitcoin remains a strong investment due to its scarcity and value over time while Ripple makes transactions faster and more efficient, helping businesses and banks worldwide. However, ChowWow introduces a new play-to-earn gaming platform that rewards players massively. By investing in these digital assets, especially the new crypto ICO, ChowWow, anyone can take steps on the road to riches.

As excitement builds, investors are also eyeing Panshibi (SHIBI) , a rising meme coin with a secret presale promising 10,000% gains. With limited time left, early adopters are rushing to secure SHIBI before its price skyrockets. Could this be the next big breakout in crypto? Panshibi: The Meme Coin Revolution with a Powerful Narrative Investors are flocking to Panshibi (SHIBI) and its compelling story is a key reason. The project exists in Bamboo Valley, a decentralized hub within Crypto Jungle. Here, users experience a combination of decentralization, sustainability and trust-based interactions. Panshibi introduces the legendary Panshibi Pandas, guardians of their digital habitat. These pandas embody resilience and collaboration, making the ecosystem about more than just financial gains. The project fosters a unified mission where users play an active role in its development. Community engagement drives Panshibi’s rapid growth. Token holders influence key decisions and earn rewards through staking. With staking APYs reaching up to 1,200%, investors gain both passive income and deeper involvement in the ecosystem. This level of participation strengthens the project’s foundation and attracts long-term supporters. Security and transparency remain top priorities. Panshibi’s smart contracts passed a full audit with perfect results, ensuring a secure investment environment. These robust measures build investor confidence, especially in volatile market conditions. Analysts predict a 145,000% surge post-launch, fueled by strong community adoption and major exchange listings. Ripple Price Gains Momentum Amid Institutional Adoption and Legal Progress Ripple (XRP) maintains a positive outlook in the market even though its trading prices vary. Experts predict strong long-term potential for Ripple (XRP) because institutions are forming more partnerships while payment system adoption increases globally. Market analysts anticipate Ripple price will achieve the $4.69 mark. This positive market outlook for XRP stems from current court decisions, growing popularity and ongoing technological developments. A favorable court outcome for Ripple in its SEC lawsuit would strengthen XRP's market value. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) services continue to expand their global reach. Financial organizations that implement ODL services facilitate rising XRP demand for international payment solutions as well as strengthen cross-border transaction capabilities. This expansion strengthens its market position and drives liquidity growth. XRP’s integration into banking solutions is another key factor fueling bullish predictions. As more institutions adopt RippleNet, the likelihood of reaching the $4.69 target becomes even stronger. With rising adoption and deepening liquidity, XRP continues to solidify its presence in the crypto market. Investors Rush to Secure SHIBI Tokens For Early Gains The Panshibi presale countdown shows 30 days left until its completion, which has generated rising anticipation. SHIBI currently sells for $0.005 and holders can expect it to reach $0.026 when listed. The estimated price increase indicates that SHIBI could surge 10,000% from its current value, making it an attractive investment for those who join early.

Simultaneously, Panshibi (SHIBI) has been making waves with its limited-time presale, offering early supporters a chance for remarkable returns. Amidst this surge of activity, the allure of SHIBI continues to capture the attention of both seasoned and new investors. Unraveling the Story Behind Panshibi's Success The captivating world of Panshibi (SHIBI) has charmed the cryptocurrency community with its narrative set in Bamboo Valley. This decentralized platform within the Crypto Jungle ecosystem promotes sustainability and trust, characteristics embodied by its iconic Panshibi Pandas. These mythical pandas symbolize resilience, offering more than financial gains by fostering a sense of community and collaboration. Participants actively engage in the project's evolution, which creates a deeply rooted community bond. This shared mission is the driving force behind the project's swift expansion and community loyalty. With high staking returns, reaching up to 1,200% APY, Panshibi attracts investors looking for passive income alongside active ecosystem participation. Such engagement solidifies the project's base and draws in long-term backers. Investors also gain peace of mind from Panshibi's strong security measures, assured by flawless smart contract audits that bolster confidence in turbulent markets. Why Ripple's Future Looks Bright Ripple (XRP) remains a beacon of optimism, especially as financial institutions increasingly adopt its solutions. The market's anticipation of Ripple hitting the $4.69 mark comes from burgeoning global partnerships and expanding payment system implementation. Ripple's potential legal victory could significantly impact its market valuation positively. As XRP continues to integrate with banking services, its demand and utility in international payment frameworks grow stronger, reinforcing predictions of a price surge. The ongoing expansion of Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) services globally, empowers financial bodies and boosts XRP's usage in cross-border transactions. This reinforces Ripple's role in enhancing market liquidity, making it a prominent player in cryptocurrency exchanges. Seizing the Moment: SHIBI's Presale Opportunity The excitement surrounding the Panshibi presale is palpable, as only 30 days remain before it concludes. At an initial price of $0.005, SHIBI presents an appealing venture with projections of climbing to $0.026 post-listing, a move that promises substantial profits for early investors.

We’ve seen coins rise and fall, but nothing matches Dawgz AI’s high-frequency trade bots, designed to turn a pocketful of ETH into a triple-double. While SHIB and DOGE fight for scraps, DAWGZ is out here printing gains. The next bull run isn’t about guessing - it’s about backing the real alpha. Are you in, or are you watching from the sidelines? Shiba Inu Price Prediction & the Meme Coin Hype Meme coins have taken over the crypto world, and Shiba Inu price prediction discussions are everywhere. With another bull run on the horizon, investors are asking if SHIB price has what it takes to outshine Dogecoin. The Shiba Inu team has worked hard to build a solid community, but can Shiba Inu rise beyond the meme coin label? While people debate the future of Shiba Inu price movements, a new player is stealing the spotlight. Dawgz AI is a meme coin with real profitability. While SHIB and DOGE rely on hype, DAWGZ is powered by AI-driven trading and staking rewards. So, should you buy Shiba Inu, or is it time to move on to a smarter investment? SHIB vs. DOGE: Who’s Got the Edge? Both Shiba Inu (SHIB) price and Dogecoin have made waves in the crypto market, but which one has the upper hand? Dogecoin: The Original Meme Coin Dogecoin has one advantage over SHIB - it came first. DOGE is still the most recognized meme coin, backed by Elon Musk's tweets and major brand adoption. Its wide use in payments gives it an edge in real-world transactions, but that doesn’t mean it’s the best investment. Shiba Inu: The Challenger with a Loyal Army SHIB isn’t backing down. The Shiba Inu ecosystem has grown beyond just being a joke. Shibarium, its Layer-2 blockchain, aims to improve transactions and reduce fees. The Shiba Inu team has also introduced token-burning mechanisms to reduce supply and drive value. But here’s the catch - Shiba Inu transactions still rely heavily on speculation. Even with burning, SHIB price prediction models show slow long-term growth compared to lower-cap coins with more upside. Dawgz AI: The Smarter Choice Neither SHIB nor DOGE guarantees long-term profitability. They rise and fall based on social media trends. Dawgz AI , however, offers automated trading bots that work 24/7 to maximize returns. It takes meme investing to the next level by combining fun and financial rewards. Why SHIB’s Growth is Limited Despite its popularity, Shiba Inu’s price forecast isn’t as promising as some might think. Burning Isn’t Enough Many SHIB holders believe in token burns, hoping that reducing supply will push Shiba Inu price higher. But burning alone doesn’t guarantee growth - demand also needs to increase, and right now, it’s struggling. Shibarium Is Still Finding Its Feet The launch of Shibarium was meant to help SHIB stand out, but adoption has been slower than expected. Many developers are hesitant to build on it, limiting SHIB’s potential use cases. SHIB’s Market Cap Makes Big Gains Difficult For SHIB to 10x, its market cap would have to grow by hundreds of billions of dollars. That’s a tough ask, considering it’s already one of the largest cryptos. The current Shiba Inu price is $0.00001538, which means reaching even one cent would require an enormous surge in demand. Smaller-cap coins like Dawgz AI offer a much higher upside with real utility, passive income opportunities, and automated trading strategies that work for investors - not just speculators. Dawgz AI: The Meme Coin That Actually Pays If you’re tired of betting on Shiba Inu’s price movements, it’s time to look at a coin that works for you - Dawgz AI. AI-Powered Trading for Passive Gains Unlike SHIB, Dawgz AI runs automated trading bots that operate 24/7, identifying profitable opportunities while you sleep. Instead of waiting for Shiba Inu (SHIB) price to spike, you’re earning consistent returns. Staking That Pays You for Holding DAWGZ isn’t just about price speculation. Holders can stake their tokens and earn ETH rewards with a competitive APY. Shiba Inu coin holders don’t have this luxury - staking options in the SHIB ecosystem aren’t as rewarding. Massive Presale Success DAWGZ AI is already making waves. Over $1.8M has been raised, with the next milestone set at $2.1M. Unlike SHIB, which relies on retail hype, Dawgz AI is backed by smart investors who see long-term value. A Token Built to Last Strong tokenomics make Dawgz AI a better long-term bet than SHIB: 8.888 billion supply to maintain scarcity 30% allocated to presale for strong initial growth 20% dedicated to staking rewards 10% for liquidity, keeping the market stable The Next Bull Run: What Will Happen to SHIB? The crypto market is gearing up for another bull run, and investors want to know - will SHIB finally overtake DOGE? Retail FOMO Could Push SHIB Up If new investors rush into meme coins, we could see Shiba Inu rise again. But without strong fundamentals, gains could be short-lived. DOGE Whales Still Runs the Show SHIB’s biggest challenge? Dogecoin whales control the meme coin market. DOGE still has more liquidity, meaning SHIB’s breakout will be difficult. Why Dawgz AI Is the Smarter Bet Instead of gambling on SHIB price prediction models, smart investors are turning to Dawgz AI’s AI-powered trading and staking rewards. It’s the only meme coin offering real passive income opportunities. Conclusion: SHIB or Dawgz AI - Which One Wins? At the end of the day, Shiba Inu price prediction is just that - a guess. While SHIB price might rise with the next bull run, it lacks real earning potential. Dawgz AI changes the game with automated trading, staking rewards, and a strong community of investors. Unlike SHIB, it isn’t just about hoping for gains - it’s designed to deliver them. So, what’s it going to be? Are you still chasing meme coin hype, or are you ready to invest in something smarter? Frequently Asked Questions How much will Shiba Inu be worth in 2025? Analysts predict Shiba Inu’s value could reach an expected average trading price of $0.00003 to $0.00005, but growth depends on market cap, burns, and Shibarium adoption. The current Shiba Inu sentiment is mixed, with some expecting gains and others saying its market capitalization is too high. The minimum SHIB price may stay around $0.000015. Dawgz AI, however, offers real profits with AI trading and staking. Will Shiba Inu coin reach $1? No, Shiba Inu’s price won’t hit $1 - its market cap would need to exceed $500 trillion. The maximum price will likely remain fractions of a cent. Dawgz AI, with AI-powered trading and staking rewards, is the smarter choice. Will Shiba hit $1 in 2040? A $1 SHIB price is unrealistic. Even with burns, the average trading price will likely stay under a cent, with a maximum price of $0.01 to $0.05. Dawgz AI delivers passive income today. Will Shiba Inu coin reach 25 cents? No, Shiba Inu’s price won’t hit $0.25 - its market capitalization would need to be unrealistically high. The expected average trading price will remain fractions of a cent. Dawgz AI offers real staking and trading rewards. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

But the question remains: is the spotlight shifting from Shiba Inu to the promising capabilities of Dawgz AI? The Rise and Challenge of Meme Coins Cryptocurrencies have given rise to a new breed of investment opportunities, with meme coins leading a revolution grounded in community support and hype. Shiba Inu, often seen as Dogecoin's fiercest competitor, has captivated investors with its loyal following. But what lies ahead for these digital currencies as we anticipate the next bull market? Explore the Dawgz AI advantage , which is changing the rules with innovative AI-powered trading and substantial staking returns, while Shiba Inu attempts to transcend its meme coin origins. Dogecoin's Legacy vs. Shiba Inu's Ambition Dogecoin, the original meme coin, has carved its niche with significant support from influential figures and widespread usage in transactions. Its established presence makes it a tough act to follow. However, Shiba Inu, with its ambitious Shibarium network and community-driven initiatives, aims to forge its path in the crypto realm. Shiba Inu's Aspirations The Shiba Inu team is striving to create a robust ecosystem that moves beyond mere speculation. By introducing Shibarium and engaging in token burning practices, they hope to add value to SHIB. Nevertheless, the true test lies in whether these efforts can translate into substantial, long-term growth. Dawgz AI: A New Era in Meme Coins As Shiba Inu and Dogecoin navigate their challenges, Dawgz AI emerges with a unique proposition: combining the thrill of meme investing with tangible rewards through AI-driven trading and generous staking terms. This model not only seeks to provide stability but also aims to deliver consistent returns for its holders. Innovation Through AI The cornerstone of Dawgz AI is its deployment of automated trading bots, which operate tirelessly to pinpoint profitable trades. This approach diminishes the reliance on market hype, offering a more reliable path to wealth generation in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Looking to the Future: What Awaits SHIB? As the next bull run looms, the question on every investor's mind is whether Shiba Inu can eclipse its competitors or if the real momentum will be with pioneers like Dawgz AI. Evaluating Potential Outcomes While the excitement around meme coins continues, critical factors such as technological advancement, market adoption, and investor confidence will shape their trajectories. SHIB's climb faces hurdles from Dogecoin's market dominance and Dawgz AI's innovative edge. Ultimately, whether it’s the allure of established brands like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu or the burgeoning opportunities in platforms such as Dawgz AI, the future of meme coins remains both exciting and unpredictable. Invest Wisely: Navigating the Meme Coin Landscape Making informed choices in the cryptocurrency space requires a keen understanding of both market dynamics and emerging technologies. Discover more about Dawgz AI to understand how it’s redefining the meme coin experience, or delve into Shiba Inu's ongoing efforts to redefine its place in the crypto world. Before diving into this volatile market, consider the long-term potential and the inherent risks associated with each investment choice. Final Thoughts: Meme Coins and Market Evolution Both seasoned investors and newcomers alike are captivated by the evolving landscape of meme coins. While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin continue to shape public perception, innovative solutions like Dawgz AI offer a glimpse into the future of crypto investments. Whether you choose to ride the traditional waves of Shiba Inu or explore the cutting-edge avenues with Dawgz AI, ensure your strategy aligns with your financial goals and risk appetite. Frequently Asked Questions What is the expected future value of Shiba Inu by 2025? Projections suggest Shiba Inu could trade between $0.00003 and $0.00005, depending on variables such as market cap growth, token burns, and Shibarium's success. Is it feasible for Shiba Inu to reach $1? Reaching a $1 value is impractical due to the enormous market cap required.

During a Wednesday AMA session on the chat app Tako, Buterin addressed user Mable Jiang’s inquiry about moments in the past year that left him frustrated or disappointed with the Ethereum Foundation, its community, or the industry. Jiang also asked if he had ever considered taking a break. In response, Buterin expressed his disappointment, particularly over criticisms that Ethereum is “bad and intolerant” for not embracing blockchain-based casinos as openly as other networks. “ Perhaps the most disappointing thing for me recently was when someone said that Ethereum is bad and intolerant because we don’t respect the ‘casinos’ on the blockchain enough, and other chains are happy to accept any application, so they are better.” He stated . Despite occasional online rants about the network, Buterin, however, noted he finds comfort in personal interactions with the Ethereum community, most of whom remain committed to the platform’s original values. “I have a responsibility to this community and cannot abandon them. We Ethereum need to work together to create the world we want to see,” he added. Buterin also suggested potential strategic shifts to enhance the network, emphasizing the need for structural improvements for the network and greater decentralization within the Ethereum Foundation. He noted that the foundation, which currently facing a backlash for lack of neutrality, might need to be less neutral at the application layer and take a more active role in supporting certain initiatives. “ This will require some changes,” he stated, adding , “But this project is worth doing.” Notably, Buterin’s response comes amid an ongoing debate in the blockchain space about balancing ethical considerations with open access. Some networks, like Solana, have taken a more permissive approach, welcoming applications across various sectors, including gambling and speculative ventures. However, this openness has also led to high-profile failures, such as the collapse of LIBRA, a meme coin on the Solana network. Recently, LIBRA collapsed, wiping out $4.5 billion in investor funds and causing a 15% drop in Solana’s value. Ethereum, in contrast, has long positioned itself as a network focused on decentralization, innovation, and long-term sustainability. These qualities have attracted institutional interest, with entities like BlackRock launching tokenized investment funds on the Ethereum network. Meanwhile, beyond his frustrations, Buterin remains actively engaged in Ethereum’s evolution, particularly its scalability through Layer 2 (L2) solutions. In January, he reaffirmed Ethereum’s commitment to scaling via L2s, identifying key challenges such as insufficient space for BLOB objects and L2 heterogeneity. He detailed upcoming upgrades, such as the Pectra update, which aims to enhance Ethereum’s transaction throughput with long-term goals, including achieving 100,000 transactions per second (TPS). He also underscored the importance of Ethereum’s economic model, advocating for ETH to serve as a “triple point asset,” functioning as a means of exchange, a consumable product, and a store of value. To strengthen Ethereum’s economic position, he proposed incentivizing L2 projects, optimizing rollup revenue structures, and adjusting BLOB pricing strategies.",Ethereum|News|Ethereum News|Vitalik Buterin,EN,0,0,ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|SOL|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-23 15:58:02

Yet a fresh contender is poised to overshadow them all, offering a stable path in an unpredictable market. Amid a sea of fading crypto sectors, this emerging presale project stands out as the one that might truly deliver. Many traders are looking beyond short-term hype and turning to real-use payment solutions reminiscent of XRP’s early success. With AI coins, meme tokens, and real-world asset ventures losing billions since January, the spotlight is shifting to an up-and-coming PayFi approach. Could this new crypto succeed where Solana, XRP, and DOGE are stumbling? Solana DEX Volume Plunges Despite Past Success Recently, Solana’s DEX volume slipped to $2.61B , the chain’s lowest activity level since mid-December. While it claims high speeds and low fees, the chain’s reliability has wavered. Unplanned network outages have eroded trust, driving some users to alternative platforms. For those monitoring price action, a decline in trading volume often indicates waning enthusiasm. A decline in Solana DEX user engagement often signals waning faith, as liquidity can vanish when trust erodes. Restoring confidence won’t be easy, especially in a market fatigued by technical hiccups. Remittix , however, sidesteps these liquidity concerns by focusing on instant fiat conversions—an approach appealing to businesses even if Solana DEX volumes keep sliding. XRP’s ETF Ambitions Versus Ongoing Legal Hurdles XRP’s community celebrates each new ETF proposal , confident a regulatory breakthrough could spark a bull run. The SEC’s final decision has a looming deadline, fueling waves of optimism. Still, the unresolved legal landscape casts a shadow. If the SEC rejects or delays once again, investor excitement could fizzle. Even if XRP’s ETF gets the green light, the token still battles with prior reputation issues and potential institutional reluctance. Remittix , however, bypasses these hurdles by focusing on everyday payments. Its token doesn’t hinge on uncertain regulatory news, allowing it to thrive as a straightforward PayFi alternative. DOGE’s Potential ETF Approval and Meme Coin Risk DOGE stands as the original meme coin, riding waves of social media momentum. The possibility of a Dogecoin ETF has stoked fresh hope among enthusiasts. Yet meme coin valuations often soar and crash based on fleeting hype, with no deep utility to keep them afloat. Traders might be wary of DOGE’s lack of real-world adoption if bigger, utility-driven options arise. Speculators foresee DOGE spiking if the ETF materializes, but a lack of meaningful use cases remains a core flaw. Remittix , by contrast, zeroes in on practical cross-border transfers, a function that’s valuable year-round regardless of meme trends. The Emerging Crypto Set to Surpass Them All While Solana’s DEX volumes dwindle and XRP and DOGE await ETF decisions, an emerging presale token is quietly conquering the payment niche. Remittix has raised more than $12 million, sold over 460 million tokens, and climbed to $0.0628—all in a year when meme tokens and real-world assets have slumped. Don’t snooze; RTX could be the next big thing! With a PayFi model that links crypto and conventional banking rails, it aims to replicate or even outdo XRP’s success in global remittances. Picture a small merchant in Southeast Asia who depends on overseas customers. Dealing with inconsistent bank fees and currency swings can eat into profits. Remittix cuts through this mess by instantly converting crypto payments into local cash at minimal cost. With Solana DEX usage slipping and altcoins in flux, Remittix’s straightforward payment framework stands firm. This pragmatic model could make it 2025’s surprise winner in a market searching for stability. On top of that, Remittix’s PayFi system provides flexibility for both everyday consumers and larger enterprises. A mid-sized software company offering services to foreign clients, for instance, can receive digital payments and seamlessly turn them into local currency—without the red tape and fees often tied to traditional banks. This versatility cements Remittix as a leading choice for those craving real utility over short-term excitement. Want to see why Remittix might be the real winner in 2025’s crypto landscape?Check out Remittix and discover its PayFi approach that could outpace Solana, XRP, and DOGE—even if they land ETF approvals.

Analysts Highlight Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a Top $0.01 DeFi Token,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-bitcoin-btc-price-going-to-crash-again-analysts-highlight-mutuum-finance-mutm-as-a-top-0-01-defi-token/,"With Bitcoin’s price struggling to hold key support levels, concerns about a potential market correction are growing. As uncertainty looms, analysts are looking beyond BTC for high-growth opportunities, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a standout pick. Currently priced at just $0.01 in its presale, Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending platform designed for real financial use cases. Unlike speculative assets, it provides borrowing and lending services while rewarding users through its structured ecosystem. With over $1 million already raised and 97% of Phase 1 sold out, many investors see MUTM as a promising alternative amid Bitcoin’s volatility. What is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is establishing itself as a promising player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. Mutuum Finance introduces a lending ecosystem where users can borrow, supply, and earn passive income. The platform’s model eliminates the need for intermediaries, allowing users to access liquidity without selling their assets. A standout feature of Mutuum Finance is its overcollateralized stablecoin, designed to provide a secure and transparent borrowing option. Built on Ethereum, this stablecoin is backed by on-chain assets at a 1:1 ratio, ensuring stability while maintaining decentralization. Borrowers can access liquidity while keeping their original holdings, making it a valuable tool for those seeking to maximize their capital efficiency. To maintain long-term value, Mutuum Finance has implemented a buy-and-distribute mechanism. A portion of platform revenue is used to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market, which are then distributed to mtToken stakers. This system creates steady demand for MUTM while rewarding active participants in the ecosystem. MtTokens are a core component of Mutuum Finance’s lending ecosystem, providing users with a way to earn passive income while maintaining liquidity. When users supply crypto assets to the platform, they receive mtTokens at a 1:1 ratio with the deposited asset. For example, supplying Ethereum (ETH) would generate mtETH, which accrues value over time based on borrower repayments. Instead of altering the exchange rate, the redeemable value of mtTokens gradually increases, ensuring that suppliers benefit from interest earned within the lending pools. These mtTokens are fully ERC-20 compliant, allowing them to be transferred, held, or even used in secondary DeFi applications while still generating yield. When users choose to withdraw their funds, they redeem their mtTokens for the underlying asset, including the accumulated interest. This structure ensures a seamless and efficient way for lenders to maximize returns without actively managing their holdings, reinforcing Mutuum Finance’s goal of creating a sustainable and rewarding decentralized lending environment. Presale Success and Growth Potential Mutuum Finance’s presale has already raised over $1 million, with more than 97% of Phase 1 tokens sold. Investors are securing MUTM at $0.01, knowing the price will increase in the next phase. With a structured roadmap, planned exchange listings, and a beta platform launch in development, many analysts believe that Mutuum Finance has the potential to become a high-growth asset in 2025. As Bitcoin experiences volatility, traders are looking for alternative investment opportunities. Mutuum Finance offers a real-use DeFi ecosystem, positioning itself as a strong contender for those seeking sustainable returns beyond market speculation. Will Bitcoin (BTC) Face Another Price Drop? Bitcoin (BTC) is facing renewed uncertainty as it struggles to maintain key support levels. With repeated tests of the $95,000 range, analysts warn that a break below this level could trigger further downside. On-chain data indicates a shift in market sentiment, with a decline in risk appetite among traders. Additionally, long liquidations in Bitcoin futures have reached a two-year high, suggesting that leveraged positions are being forced out, adding to selling pressure. If Bitcoin loses its current support, analysts highlight potential downside targets between $88,000 and $91,000, with a worst-case scenario near $77,000. However, some believe that a sharp bounce from lower levels could attract fresh buying interest, preventing a prolonged downturn. While the short-term outlook remains uncertain, many investors are looking at alternative assets like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for potential opportunities amid BTC’s volatility.

Notably, attempts to recover last week, after prices rebounded from a flash crash to $0.20 earlier this month, have been watered down, with the top meme coin wiping out all of last week’s gains. This silent price action comes amid a broader market trend. Further analysis reveals that key on-chain metrics, such as daily active addresses and transaction volumes, have remained relatively flat. On-chain data also indicates a notable decline in whale activity. On Thursday, analyst Ali Martinez observed that large DOGE holders have adopted a “wait-and-watch” approach, with no significant buying or selling activity in recent days. “Dogecoin DOGE whales have stayed on the sidelines during the recent volatility, showing little to no significant buying or selling activity, ” Martinez tweeted, suggesting a cautious sentiment among major investors, which is contributing to the current price stability. Nevertheless, amid this price lull, analysts continue to assess this period as “the calm before the storm,” actively predicting triple-digit percentage gains. Popular crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade tweeted his outlook on Thursday, saying that Dogecoin has entered the “Boring Phase.” According to the pundit, traders should “Expect tight consolidation at the current level over the next few weeks before the massive DOGE rally.” Notably, the chart accompanying his tweet compared Dogecoin’s recent flat trend in February 2025 to a similar pattern before a major rally in late 2017, suggesting DOGE may experience weeks of tight price consolidation before a significant upward rally if history repeats . Earlier on Wednesday, the pundit also posted another analysis referencing Dogecoin’s weekly Stochastic RSI, a technical indicator that measures momentum. His analysis showed a crossover in the oversold zone, typically signaling a potential price rebound, supporting a bullish target of $1.50 per coin based on a target price inside an ascending channel. Elsewhere, analyst Dima Potts predicted that Dogecoin could surpass $10, citing a historical pattern of peaks occurring every four years. He highlighted that the first cycle saw a 21,821% surge over 1,442 days, while the second followed the same timeline with an even greater 54,890% increase. Potts believes Dogecoin’s next peak could arrive around mid-April 2025 if this trend continues. However, he also warned that DOGE would likely experience a decline before its next major rally. “With recent price action, DOGE has maintained its historical pattern. I expect Dogecoin to gradually move toward the purple line or the $0.28 range, similar to previous cycles. Beyond this level, we should see increased volatility, with prices consolidating before pushing toward new yearly highs and eventually all-time highs.” He wrote. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.24, reflecting a 2.13% drop in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|Doge|Dogecoin,EN,0,0,DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-23 16:03:30

The yellow metal has continuously registered fresh peaks and is close to breaking above $3,000/oz for the first time ever – meanwhile, BTC has been stuck below $100,000 for most of February. Gold Runs Wild Experts have outlined numerous reasons behind the precious metal’s ascent in 2025. Perhaps the most probable one is the rising inflation in the US and other countries, coupled with the global uncertainty prompted by President Trump’s controversial actions since he assumed office for the second time in mid-January. Being the go-to global asset in times of growing inflation and economic uncertainty, investors and central banks turned to gold in an unprecedented manner, perhaps last seen during the early days of the COVID-19 crash in 2020. Financial gurus are now rushing to praise the yellow metal after years of disregarding it, claiming that the $3,000 price tag will fall inevitably and will be just the start of an even more impressive rally. Whether that would come to fruition is anyone’s guess at the moment, but it’s true that the metal has expanded its dominance over other assets in the past few months. Gold stands unchallenged at the first position with a total market capitalization of almost $20 trillion. This number is higher than the next seven financial assets combined (which include BTC). XAUUSD. Source: TradingView BTC Struggles Gold’s price chart shows a contrasting picture compared to BTC’s (below). The precious metal actually tumbled after Trump’s win at the 2024 presidential elections in early November, while most riskier assets, such as bitcoin, exploded. It took three months for gold to recover the lost ground, which happened in early February. In contrast, the primary cryptocurrency skyrocketed immediately after the elections and, after some ups and downs in late 2024 and early 2025, peaked on Trump’s inauguration day at almost $110,000. Since then, it has corrected hard and currently stands almost 15% away from its all-time high. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView In contrast, the yellow metal has only solidified its strong run in February. It marked a new all-time high on Thursday, and even though it retraced slightly, it’s about 1-2% away from it. So, do these completely different price movements spell even more trouble for BTC? After all, experts are convinced that gold will keep climbing and charting fresh peaks. Does that mean that bitcoin will continue to struggle? Well, there’s no simple answer to this question. The fact is that demand for BTC has faded in recent weeks, especially in the US, which is evident by the declining Coinbase Premium metric and the lackluster performance of the local ETFs. However, the financial markets, and crypto in particular, are highly irrational and unlogical places to be. It’s difficult to make even educated predictions, but bitcoin often does the opposite of what people expect of it. As such, don’t be too surprised if it reverses its trajectory in the following weeks and months and heads for new peaks regardless of gold’s performance.

Meme-based cryptos have witnessed a substantial surge in popularity, thanks to the tokens’ close ties with memes and the prevailing social media hype and trends. Despite meme coins’ volatile nature, they have captured investors’ interest. Here are the three best meme coins for investors who are open to embracing long-term potential meme coins. They include Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and ChowWow . Dogecoin Price Prediction: Is DOGE Set for a Rally? When it comes to Dogecoin price prediction, it's tough to point out whether the meme coin will live up to its hype. However, the Dogecoin price movement has always stood out over the past years despite recording significant losses. In 2021, the price of Dogecoin managed to record an ATH of $0.7376. despite starting the year on the low. Dogecoin yearly price movement | Source: CoinMarketCap Dogecoin has had its unique moments, riding the wave of meme coin hype and excitement, but recent times have seen the DOGE token dip significantly. Dogecoin’s minimum price, compared to the maximum price, has fluctuated immensely in the past. The meme coin has had some serious dips, making investors nervous. However, according to Ali Martinez, Dogecoin is set to record a 25% rally if it breaks out of its symmetrical triangle. A move above the $0.342 level will also be considered a more definitive breakout trigger for the price of Dogecoin in 2025. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Is a Breakout on the Way? Shiba Inu’s price movement has everyone talking about a potential breakout. Shiba Inu has become a household name in the crypto market mainly because of its meme coin status and the wild price rallies it has recorded in the past. Many people got excited about the SHIB’s price movement when it was listed on major exchanges, and the hype surrounding the meme coin led to significant profits for early investors. Shiba Inu price analysis | Source: CoinMarketCap However, 2025 has seen the Shiba Inu price struggle to regain momentum. Over the recent months, Shiba Inu’s price forecast has been all over the place. While some analysts predict a significant rally, others remain unsure. The Shiba Inu team will need a strong catalyst to keep pushing its average price up to achieve significant growth. Moreover, according to Lucie, Shiba Inu is ready to surge by thousands per cent. This is a move that could see the SHIB token aim for its previous ATH of $0.00008845 in 2025, backed by increased mainstream adoption and upcoming partnerships. ChowWow (CHOW) Gains Viral Momentum ChowWow (CHOW) is a stake-to-earn and GameFi platform built on the SOL blockchain.

Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Go On A 110-Million Memecoin Buying Spree—What’s Next For DOGE? Obviously, the token’s performance came on the back of a gloomy mood in the cryptocurrency markets after the Bybit security breach and what came thereafter for crypto prices. Thus, SEI has successfully set its own pace to attract its own followers on the investor side and show great aptitude for growth in face of these unfavorable market developments. Technical Analysis Points To Robust Trajectory A close examination of SEI price fluctuations reveals glaring signs of a possible trend reversal. After testing the August 2024 lows, the token essentially held on to the required support levels, opening a window for incoming price changes. From a technical perspective, market participants’ optimism stems not only from a decisive close above the 1-day EMA20 but also from SEI’s impressive breakout from the daily downtrend line. Traders Assess Essential Price Thresholds, Resistance Areas Despite the optimism of SEI’s recent performance, seasoned traders are adopting a prudent stance. The present price fluctuation may signify a corrective impulse, notably rectifying the market imbalance established on February 2nd and 3rd. The $0.33 price point is a critical resistance level, having previously functioned as a support zone. The reclaiming of this level could significantly enhance the token’s mid-term bullish market framework. Nonetheless, SEI persists in trading beneath the significant 1-day EMA200, a technical indicator that has traditionally served as a robust resistance threshold. $SEI is on the verge of a multi-month trendline Breakout.. 📈 Expecting a 60-70% Bullish Rally so Keep an eye on it..#Crypto #SEI #SEIUSDT pic.twitter.com/OsHOeO8lDR — Captain Faibik 🐺 (@CryptoFaibik) February 22, 2025 Market Analysts Assess Price Forecast Now, the question is: Does SEI have the wherewithal to hit a sixfold, or even a sevenfold increase in price? For Captain Faibik, a cryptocurrency researcher, the crypto has the capability to do just that. In fact, he sees SEI rising that much in the coming weeks. “SEI is on the verge of a multi-month trendline Breakout,” Fabik said in an X post. According to the analysis, SEI’s present route could cause a substantial price hike. The token’s ability to break key resistance levels and the market’s performance may shorten this trend.

As the cryptocurrency market stabilizes, SEI’s performance metrics and technical indicators will be closely monitored by investors and traders. The token’s ability to maintain its upward trajectory, especially concerning key price levels and moving averages, will likely dictate its effectiveness in leveraging the existing market framework.

The Solana price holding at the $174 support level is make-or-break for bullish momentum. If it bounces back from this zone, we might see it zoom to $250 or even higher. In more positive developments, Panshibi , a new meme coin, is gaining traction, with its presale already raising over $1.1 million. This hot new crypto skillfully combines tangible utility for investors with the best aspects of meme coin culture and community-driven initiatives. So, what are the key features behind Panshibi’s brilliance and will Solana overcome its current resistance? Let's find out! Enter Panshibi: Hot meme token attracting serious attention with its 100x potential. The meme coin market has produced some of the most viral crypto success stories and Panshibiis looking to take the trend to the next level. It's a complete distinction from the traditional meme's speculative fad by ingeniously combining SocialFi elements and AI features to allow investors to participate in several quests and earn rewards for themselves. The project is gaining serious momentum and has already raised over $1.1 million in its presale. There is growing anticipation around its ability to disrupt the meme and Asian crypto sectors. This feature proves Panshibi's 100x potential is more than just speculation; a solid fundamental back it. Beyond price gains, the staking rewards for Panshibi are among the highest in the industry, offering 1,200% APY with rewards claimable shortly after launch. Panshibi’s ecosystem is built for continuous expansion. The roadmap consists of listings on top of decentralized and centralized exchanges, NFT integrations and innovative Social-Fi features that will keep the community engaged and the project evolving. All the early signs indicate that this is a token with a vision and its team is committed to seeing it through. With plans to list on multiple major exchanges, analysts predict that Panshibi could achieve its proposed 100x by 2025, giving early investors a massive upside potential. It has a 60-day presale model and each Panshibi token continuously appreciates before listing, ensuring steady returns for early investors. Solana ecosystem grows despite recent LIBRA setback Analysts predict the Solana price is about to make a shock comeback to the previous support level of $180. Despite the recent retracement in the Solana price, it has outperformed Ethereum's 8% YTD decline. With major institutions like Franklin Templeton expanding their operations with Solana, investor confidence and institutional interest have reached a new height. In the groundbreaking move, Franklin Templeton added Solana to its $594 million cap OnChainU.S. Government Money Market Fund (FOBXX) to improve asset tokenization. This and the belief that crypto gurus believe SOL could soon surpass $200 have raised bullish projections as high as $320 by the end of the year. These positive sentiments come amid the backlash from the recent LIBRA crash, which raised several concerns about the network's long-term innovation and future. Although the recent scandal has affected other Solana-based projects, the Solana price seems to be recovering perfectly. Grow your portfolio with Panshibi's 100x ROI While the Solana price is about to rebound, Panshibi's 100x potential has captured investors’ interest. The $SHIBI meme coin is currently in stage 4 presale at just $0.005, offering early market participants the chance to buy in before the anticipated price explosion. Prices are expected to be 145,000% higher post-launch, owing to the project’s unique value proposition for investors and real-world purposes.

Solana exemplifies resilience, while innovation is embodied by Panshibi , a new player in the meme coin market. Solana's Path Forward Amid Market Fluctuations The value of Solana holds at a critical threshold of $174, setting the stage for potential upward movement. Industry analysts suggest that a rebound could propel Solana to reach $250, reaffirming its place among the top-performing cryptos. Notably, institutional investors like Franklin Templeton are reinforcing their support, reflecting growing trust in Solana’s future prospects. Franklin Templeton has notably included Solana in its expansive $594 million OnChain U.S. Government Money Market Fund (FOBXX). This strategic inclusion is a testament to Solana's tokenization capabilities and hints at the potential for it to surpass the $200 mark soon. Panshibi: Beyond Memes to Tangible Value Meanwhile, the Panshibi token is carving out a niche by fusing the viral allure of meme coins with tangible financial benefits. Its presale success, amassing over $1.1 million, signifies a growing investor interest due to its robust utility and community-driven projects. Emphasizing rewards and investor participation, Panshibi aims to transform how meme coins are perceived and utilized. Panshibi’s ecosystem stands out by offering a 1,200% annual percentage yield (APY) on staking rewards, poised to make it a strong contender in the crypto landscape. Its roadmap includes innovative integrations and exchange listings that cater to long-term investor interests and community growth. The Dual Attraction of Solana and Panshibi Amid the Solana price's journey towards recovery, the Panshibi token presents an attractive proposition for investors. Priced at $0.005 during the presale, it offers an intriguing entry point with a promise of substantial returns post-launch. The presale strategy ensures gradual token value appreciation, encouraging early adoption. While Solana continues to navigate its challenges and opportunities, Panshibi capitalizes on its projected potential and robust foundation. The Panshibi presale is accessible through several platforms, providing potential investors with multiple engagement points: Telegram: https://t.me/panshibi Twitter: https://x.com/panshibi_ Website: https://panshibi.com As the world of cryptocurrency evolves, Solana and Panshibi's trajectories showcase the dynamism and diversity of opportunities within the market.

With over $12.6 million already raised and more than 470 million tokens sold, many investors believe Remittix could be the next big player in cross-border payments, a role once championed by XRP. While older cryptos face stagnation, Remittix appears primed to solve everyday transactional problems through a user-friendly PayFi mode. A Quick Look at the Problem Remittix Solves For years, transferring money across borders has been plagued by long wait times and high fees. XRP rose to prominence by speeding up these transfers, yet it has since weathered legal and regulatory storms. In the meantime, transaction demands have only grown. Remittix takes this challenge head-on. Its system instantly converts crypto into local currency, then deposits it directly into bank accounts worldwide. Think of a business in Chile seeking to pay an overseas supplier or a freelancer in Ghana who needs quick access to funds from European clients. Remittix aims to accomplish these transactions at near-instant speeds. Unlike many tokens that hinge on hype, Remittix emphasizes a direct service. If the platform’s PayFi approach becomes the norm, the cost savings and speed could attract millions of users fed up with traditional wires. Breaking Down the PayFi Model Remittix’s PayFi model aims to simplify the user experience. A retailer in Peru who accepts stablecoin payments from a customer in Germany can convert those tokens to local currency in seconds, with minimal fees. The buyer doesn’t need to wrestle with multiple steps or wait for days; everything happens behind the scenes on the Remittix network. Experts view PayFi as a significant upgrade over older methods. XRP once set the standard for quick transfers, but Remittix wants to build on that blueprint, making transactions more accessible to freelancers, e-commerce sites and even everyday consumers sending money abroad. By sidestepping complexity, Remittix may draw an audience beyond crypto enthusiasts and into mainstream finance a space desperate for modern, user-oriented solutions. Funding, Security and Future Outlook Much of Remittix’s credibility stems from its successful presale, which has raised over $12.6 million at a token price of $0.0628. With more than 470 million tokens sold, the project has shown strong market appeal, even as many crypto presales struggle to gain traction. Observers say this momentum stems from the team’s commitment to transparency and safety. Liquidity and team tokens are locked, reducing risk for early adopters. An audited contract further reassures cautious investors who recall recent scams and rug pulls. Looking ahead, Remittix envisions forging partnerships with payment gateways and possibly major online retailers. If these integrations flourish, the token’s usage could spike well beyond typical speculation. The cross-border remittance industry is valued in the hundreds of billions, and replacing even a small percentage of that flow could dramatically boost RTX’s market cap. Conclusion: The Next XRP for 2025? Analysts see Remittix (RTX) as the potential heir to XRP’s early days, when it was hailed as the solution for cross-border payments. While XRP remains a major name, ongoing legal and regulatory challenges have left room for competitors. Remittix’s simpler, more direct approach may fill that void, offering near-instant settlements that resonate with anyone suffering from slow bank transfers. Remittix presale suggests a thirst for practical tokens with real use cases. With a price under $0.10 and an ever-expanding remittance market, Remittix seems poised to grow, possibly echoing the success XRP once enjoyed. If PayFi resonates on a global scale, experts’ predictions of Remittix becoming the next XRP by 2025 might not be far-fetched. For now, the token stands out as a fresh, straightforward answer to a problem millions face daily pointing to a future where crypto truly meets mainstream demand.

Investors accumulating between 1,000 and 10,000 XRP today could be positioning themselves for substantial gains, provided certain key catalysts come into play. Key Drivers That Could Propel XRP’s Value The potential inclusion of XRP in a U.S. digital asset reserve and the prospect of an XRP-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) are the two major developments that could significantly influence XRP’s market trajectory. These possibilities would pave the way for institutional involvement on a grand scale, potentially driving an exponential increase in XRP’s price. XRP as Part of the U.S. Digital Asset Reserve—A Financial Strategy? Among the boldest speculations is that XRP could be integrated into a U.S. digital asset reserve . Ripple has consistently engaged with lawmakers and regulators. CEO Brad Garlinghouse has been actively discussing blockchain’s influence on the financial system, including conversations with U.S. President Donald Trump . Should the U.S. government use Ripple’s 37.7 billion escrowed XRP as part of its financial strategy, some argue it could mitigate national debt, which currently stands at a staggering $36 trillion. However, at its current price of $2.52 per token, Ripple’s escrow holdings are valued at approximately $97.26 billion—nowhere near enough to offset the U.S. debt in any meaningful way. For XRP alone to clear the national debt , its price would need to surge astronomically. A calculation based on the $36 trillion debt suggests XRP would have to skyrocket to $955 per token, a nearly 36,911% increase from its current level. While this is an extreme scenario, it underscores the potential valuation XRP could reach if it becomes a crucial factor in the financial system. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The XRP ETF: A Major Catalyst for Price Growth? Even if XRP never becomes a reserve asset, another powerful catalyst could be the approval of an XRP ETF. Like Bitcoin ETFs which saw over $35 billion in capital inflows in 2024, an XRP ETF could attract significant institutional investment. If XRP ETFs were to capture just half of Bitcoin ETF inflows, that would equate to a $17 billion investment. Assuming a modest 1:10 ratio of new inflow to market capitalization growth, XRP’s total valuation could increase by approximately $170 billion. Currently, XRP’s market capitalization stands at $150 billion. With this projected increase, its market cap would reach approximately $235 billion. Given its circulating supply of 57.7 billion tokens, this would translate to $5.54 per token—a 134.2% gain from today’s price of $2.52. Why Holding 1,000 to 10,000 XRP Could Be Transformative For those accumulating XRP now, these potential scenarios offer exciting opportunities. Here’s what different holdings could amount to if XRP reaches these speculative price points: If XRP attains $5.54 due to an ETF-driven surge, an investment of 1,000 XRP (currently $2,580) would grow to $5,540. Should XRP ever reach the extreme valuation of $955 as a reserve asset, a 10,000 XRP investment could balloon to an incredible $9.55 million. Although these forecasts present enticing possibilities, they remain speculative. T here’s no guarantee that such price movements will materialize. Investors should carefully assess the risks while considering XRP’s potential future trajectory. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Experts predict that maintaining this growth momentum could result in significant future gains. Pepecoin: Combining Fame with Functional Utility Pepecoin's rise to prominence is fueled by its meme-based charm and widespread recognition. As it extends its reach through practical applications, PEPE emerges as a formidable option for investors seeking substantial profits.

How PayFi Is Becoming 2025's Fastest Growing Narrative As RTX Outpaces SOL and ADA,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/cryptos-next-100x-opportunity-how-payfi-is-becoming-2025s-fastest-growing-narrative-as-rtx-outpaces-sol-and-ada,"The Solana price has been a key focus for investors, but recent trends suggest that PayFimight be stealing the spotlight. As blockchain payments gain traction, Remittix (RTX) is emerging as a top contender, outpacing Solana and ADA's growth potential. With major crypto sectors like meme coins and AI projects losing billions, PayFi is proving to be the fastest-growing narrative of 2025, offering real-world adoption that investors are flocking to. Solana Faces Volatility but Retains Strong Whale Interest The Solana price is sliding to $177 following a 10% decrease over the past week. Analysts warn that SOL might slip to $120 if selling pressure persists before attempting a rebound. However, broader market conditions will determine the next Solana price and competition will likely dictate the road to recovery. Source: CoinMarketCap Many of Solana's recent troubles stem from its ties to controversial meme coins, including HARRYBOLZ and LIBRA. Both projects had been infamous for pump-and-dump schemes, which wiped out investors and slashed industry confidence. The uncertainty increased when Ben Chow, co-founder of Meteora Protocol, abruptly resigned, posing concerns about internal stability within Solana's ecosystem. Despite these challenges, whale activity around SOL remains strong. Large investors have continued accumulating the asset, with recent data showing that whales have acquired over $15 million worth of SOL. A whale wallet pulled 30,900 SOL tokens worth $6.27 million, indicating long-term Solana potential. The outlook for the Solana price is uncertain, but institutional investors and whale accumulation point to a belief in its future worth. With time, market dynamics could shift toward recovery, but SOL remains volatile, where a deeper correction or a potential rebound are both possibilities. Remittix (RTX): Leading the PayFi Revolution The crypto market is shifting and Remittix (RTX) is leading the charge in the rapidly growing PayFi sector. While speculative assets like meme coins and AI tokens are cooling, Remittixpositions itself as gaining real-world utility. It's redefining how digital assets are utilized for payments with immediate crypto-to-fiat conversions, smooth payments and extremely low costs. Traditional financial systems still experience slow-paced transactions and high processing costs, particularly for international payments. Remittix removes these inefficiencies by enabling users to convert over forty cryptocurrencies to fiat immediately. This service is incredible for companies, freelancers and individuals who require quick and inexpensive worldwide payments. Usability is a primary obstacle to crypto adoption. Many people hesitate to use digital assets for payments due to complex withdrawal processes and limited merchant support. Remittix is changing this with its crypto debit card, allowing users to spend their digital assets anywhere Visa and Mastercard are accepted. This feature makes digital payments as simple as using a traditional bank card. Privacy is a hot subject in digital finance, with central platforms monitoring every transaction. Remittix values financial privacy and ensures that transactions are private and never traced to third parties. Unlike conventional banking, which blocks or delays payments, Remittix gives users complete control over their funds. With growing adoption among merchants and service providers, Remittix is fast becoming the go-to payment solution for those seeking an alternative to traditional payment systems. Its quick settlement and considerably reduced transaction costs appeal to companies searching for efficiency and cost savings. While the Solana price and other significant altcoins deal with market uncertainty, Remittix is proving that real-world use cases outweigh hyped speculation. Cardano (ADA) Consolidates as Bulls and Bears Clash for Control Cardano (ADA) trades at $0.805, a 0.92% weekly increase. Despite this tiny uptick, ADA remains in a consolidation phase without any clear direction. The Cardano price has traded between $0.796 and $0.813 during past sessions, suggesting uncertainty among traders. ADA must break the $0.81 to $0.85 resistance zone, historically producing selling pressure. If buyers can get through this barrier, the primary target is $0.90 to $1, following a long-term trendline that usually contains price peaks. As Cardano enters its consolidation stage, several investors are searching for additional opportunities in the market. Remittix (RTX), a rising ERC-20 token in the PayFi sector, is catching attention as it gains traction in its ongoing ICO. With instant crypto-to-FIAT transactions and growing merchant adoption, Remittix is a promising alternative for those looking beyond speculative price movements. Join the Remittix Presale Before the Next Price Increase The Remittix (RTX) presale is gaining momentum, with investors recognizing its potential in the booming PayFi sector. The token is currently priced at $0.0645 with over $12.6 million already raised. As adoption grows, experts predict that RTX could surge 100x, mirroring the success of payment-focused cryptos like XRP and XLM. Investors looking for more than just speculation are moving into RTX, recognizing its potential to reshape the payments landscape. Don’t miss out on secure RTX now before the next price jump and be part of the future of digital finance.

Several digital currencies have seen sharp declines, with Fartcoin witnessing a 39% drop over the past week, even as Hyperliquid shows signs of recovery after a period of downturn. Conversely, Lunex Network is gaining traction among investors, thanks to its innovative DeFi platform. With no requirements for KYC, coupled with its unique cross-chain liquidity and lucrative staking options, Lunex Network stands out as a potential leader in the altcoin arena heading into 2025. A Struggling Fartcoin Finds Hope After an impressive rise since its inception in late 2024, Fartcoin has faced turbulent times, experiencing an 80% fall earlier this year. Nevertheless, recent trends on its daily chart suggest a possible revival. Currently priced at $0.3170, a minor 1% daily dip reflects waning bearish sentiment, prompting savvy investors to seize buying opportunities. Analysts are optimistic, forecasting that Fartcoin could approach the $0.90 mark if it overcomes current challenges. Optimism for Hyperliquid's Future Having peaked at over $34 in late December, Hyperliquid entered a phase of consolidation. However, its value has recently climbed by 11.48% in the past month, suggesting renewed bullish interest. Now trading at $24.43 after a 4.82% intraday boost, investor interest seems to be shifting, evidenced by a 56% drop in trading volume over the past day. Despite this, confidence remains, with projections hinting at a potential surge to $30 soon, and possibly $45 by 2025. Lunex Network: A Rising Star Excitement surrounds Lunex Network as it garners substantial funding during its presale phase, collecting over $7.2 million with a growing number of investors. Its decentralized ecosystem facilitates seamless cross-chain operations, positioning itself as a front-runner in the altcoin sector. Lunex Network's user-centric approach eliminates KYC barriers, fostering a decentralized trading environment spanning thousands of cryptocurrency pairs. Its innovative Web3 technology and secure smart contracts offer a unique solution to blockchain fragmentation. Empowering users further, Lunex Network operates without centralized control, granting holders voting privileges within its ecosystem. Moreover, long-term token holders benefit from an ongoing share of the platform's revenue through buybacks, with rewards reaching up to 18% APY. Despite widespread market challenges following the tariff upheavals, Lunex Network's presale continues to attract investors. With LNEX priced at $0.007, it's a promising opportunity before anticipated price jumps of 1800% post-launch.

Fartcoin has crashed by 39% over the last week, while Hyperliquid is bouncing back from a weekly decline. Meanwhile, Lunex Network is surging in popularity as investors flock to its revolutionary DeFi ecosystem. With its no-KYC policy, cross-chain liquidity solutions and high-yield staking rewards, Lunex Network is emerging as the top altcoin to watch in 2025. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) Bounces Back After 80% Decline Fartcoin has experienced rapid growth since its launch in November 2024, but the Solana-based meme coin has faced significant declines in February, losing over 80% of its value. Despite this negative outlook, Fartcoin’s daily chart is hinting toward a potential recovery. Fartcoin is currently selling at $0.3170 following a daily decline of just 1%. While still in the red this smaller decline suggests that crypto bears are losing traction as investors buy up the dip Although Fartcoin is still trading below its key Exponential Moving Averages, the CCI and Momentum Indicators are flashing strong buy signals. As Fartcoin’s RSI moves to the neutral level at 50, analysts expect a potential Fartcoin rally toward the $0.90 pivot level soon. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Eyes New Highs as Bullish Momentum Returns Hyperliquid’s price reached an all-time high of over $34 on December 22 before entering a brief consolidation phase. In the last month, Hyperliquid has regained its upward momentum, recording an 11.48% increase in value. Hyperliquid is currently trading for $24.43 after an intraday increase of 4.82%. Despite the increase, investors appear to be purchasing alternatives to Hyperliquid as the token’s trading volume decreased by over 56% in the last 24 hours. Nonetheless, Hyperliquid investors remain bullish. Experts believe that Hyperliquid could rally to $30 before the end of Q1, with bullish predictions anticipating highs of $45 in 2025. Lunex Network (LNEX) Continues Upward Movement with High Adoption Rate During its Presale Lunex Network has already raised over $7.2 million during its presale with thousands of new investors joining each week. The project introduces an interconnected ecosystem that powers cross-chain transactions with unlimited liquidity and is already on track to become the leading altcoin of 2025. Lunex Network’s commitment to simplicity is evident in the platform’s no-KYC policy and decentralized nature. Users can trade over 50,000 cryptocurrency pairs across multiple blockchains without providing any sensitive information. This user-first approach helps Lunex Network bridge the gap between isolated blockchains through disruptive Web3 technology and a fully audited smart contract. Lunex Network also gives traders complete control over their assets as the platform removes centralized governance and automated market makers. Investors can use their LNEX tokens to exercise voting rights within the Lunex Network ecosystem which turns long-term token holders into significant shareholders in the platform’s success. Long-term investors also receive a portion of Lunex Network’s weekly revenue through an open market buyback mechanism. The repurchased LNEX are distributed to current holders as staking rewards with up to 18% APYs, giving token holders a consistent source of passive income in exchange for their loyalty. While several tokens experienced price crashes during Trump’s recent tariff spree, LunexNetwork has continued its upward movement as investors continue to join the ongoing presale. LNEX tokens are currently selling for only $0.007 each, making now the ideal time to invest in Lunex Network before the token’s price skyrockets by 1800% after the official launch.

While platforms like Chainlink and Avalanche have focused on enhancing blockchain infrastructure and scalability, respectively, BlockDAG is prioritizing user engagement through a gamified Achievements Page. This approach sets BlockDAG apart, emphasizing active participation rather than just passive holding. This article analyzes BlockDAG’s engagement strategy in comparison to Chainlink and Avalanche, examining how it contributes to long-term user involvement and ecosystem growth. BlockDAG has currently raised over $197.3 million in its presale, selling over 18.5 billion coins. Currently priced at $0.0248 in batch 27, this represents a 2380% surge from its initial price. This successful presale underscores the market’s interest in BlockDAG’s approach to user engagement. BlockDAG’s Achievements Page: Redefining User Interaction Many cryptocurrency projects face the challenge of sustaining user interest beyond the initial purchase and trading phase. BlockDAG addresses this issue by integrating an Achievements Page. This feature allows users to participate in challenges, earn XP, and unlock exclusive rewards. This gamified system promotes active involvement within the ecosystem, encouraging continuous participation rather than passive holding. BlockDAG’s model emphasizes the importance of consistent interaction, a key element often missing in other blockchain projects. The XP-based system fosters a sense of community and progress, incentivizing users to remain engaged with the platform. This approach moves beyond purely financial incentives, creating a more dynamic and interactive user experience. The introduction of weekly challenges further strengthens user engagement. Participants have consistent reasons to return to the platform, contributing to a vibrant and active community. This continuous interaction differentiates BlockDAG from projects that primarily rely on token appreciation to attract and retain users. BlockDAG’s emphasis on active participation positions it as more than just a digital asset; it’s an ecosystem designed for ongoing interaction and contribution. The platform’s success in raising significant capital during its presale, exceeding $197.3 million with over 18.5 billion coins sold, indicates that the market recognizes the value of this user-centric approach. The current price of $0.0248 in batch 27, a remarkable 2380% increase, further validates this positive reception. Chainlink: Enhancing Functionality through Decentralization Chainlink, established in 2017, focuses on solving the blockchain oracle problem. It enables smart contracts to securely access real-world data, expanding the utility of blockchain technology. Chainlink provides crucial services like reliable price feeds, verifiable randomness, and cross-chain interoperability. Its integrations with various platforms, including DeFi projects, NFT initiatives, and enterprise applications, highlight its importance in the blockchain ecosystem. Chainlink has partnered with major players like Google Cloud and SWIFT, solidifying its position as a key infrastructure provider. The platform’s ongoing development, including initiatives like CCIP, further strengthens its capabilities in data security and scalability. Avalanche: Building a Faster Future Avalanche, launched in 2020 by Ava Labs, tackles the challenge of blockchain scalability while maintaining decentralization. Its unique consensus mechanism and three-chain architecture enable fast transactions and low fees. Avalanche’s Ethereum compatibility has attracted developers working on DeFi, gaming, and NFT projects. The platform’s subnets allow enterprises and institutions to create custom blockchains, increasing its adoption across various sectors. Continuous upgrades in security, interoperability, and efficiency have cemented Avalanche’s position as a prominent player in the blockchain space. A Quick Recap While Chainlink and Avalanche have made substantial contributions to blockchain technology, BlockDAG’s approach to user engagement offers a different perspective. Chainlink has expanded blockchain functionality, and Avalanche has addressed scalability concerns. However, BlockDAG recognizes that long-term success depends on fostering an active and engaged community. Its gamified system, which rewards participation and progress, distinguishes it from other projects. As the cryptocurrency domain becomes more competitive, the ability to maintain a vibrant community will be crucial for sustained growth. BlockDAG’s XP-based system provides a model for how to cultivate and reward user involvement, potentially reshaping how projects interact with their communities. A thriving ecosystem depends not only on technological advancements but also on the active participation of its users.

Regulatory Support Fuels Growth Analysts consider a favorable regulatory environment to be one of the factors responsible for a thriving cryptocurrency sector. The region has embraced new financial products such as spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). One of the surveyed countries, Brazil, made history last week. Brazil securities regulator Comissão de Valores Mobiliários (CVM), has approved a spot XRP ETF in the country . In addition to the regulatory nod, users are keen to expand their holdings in crypto assets due to the increasing value of cryptocurrencies. Guilherme Nazar, Binance’s regional VP of Latin America, maintained that countries in the region show immense potential as crypto expands. Nazar stated that the survey results align with their observation while operating in the area. Financial Security and Investment Growth Drive Crypto Adoption Some top reasons for this growing crypto adoption have been linked to the need for users to protect their money. Other indicators were privacy and portfolio diversification. Notably, in 2024, Brazil alone recorded an inflow of $24.7 million in crypto investment. Results from the Binance survey show that half of the average respondents have been using crypto for at least a year. Meanwhile, most surveyed said they were investing in crypto with anticipation of gains and financial freedom.

Many who rode the meme coin wave are now shifting focus to more practical crypto coins. Currently, an emerging PayFi token is stealing the spotlight with whispers of 100x potential in 2025. What’s driving this change? Loyal Shiba Inu fans once revealed in its wild 2021 surge. But today, they’re rethinking their bets. The promise of a new token with real-world use is hard to ignore and this new Defi project offers something SHIB lacks tangible utility that could reshape global finance. Shiba Inu’s Price Action Struggles: Remittix Set To Deliver 100x Gains Shiba Inu token holders welcomed the recent 128 million coin burn that reduced SHIB supply and created speculations about a 300% Shiba Inu price increase. Despite this, the Shiba Inu price, now at $0.000015 on February 22, 2025, struggles against market headwinds. Shiba Inu price is a far cry from its all-time high of $0.000088 . Latest news from Shiba Inu’s ecosystem isn’t painting a rosy picture either. Large holders are dumping SHIB at an alarming rate. Data shows their demand has dropped by 88% in weeks. Smaller wallets are picking up the slack, but it’s not enough. The Shiba Inu price is feeling the weight of this exodus. The token future prices face uncertainty because whales have discarded 88% of their assets while 584.3 trillion tokens remain in circulation. Analysts at Coincodex offering their Shiba Inu price predictions forecast a 15% decrease in the next 3 months. Efforts like Shibarium and ShibaSwap aim to boost utility. Yet, market sentiment remains shaky. Remittix, is the new PayFi coin offering SHIB holders a guaranteed alternative. Its focus isn’t fleeting hype, it's real-world use. Cross-border transfers that once took days now take minutes. For SHIB fans tired of rollercoasters, RTX is the next solid ground. A Shift in Shiba Inu Investor Mindset And What It means For Remittix Shiba Inu price once thrived on memes and social media buzz. That magic has faded in 2025. Social mentions are down 40% quarterly. Investors want more than hype; they crave utility. Remittix fits that bill perfectly. Remittix blends crypto speed with banking ease. It converts over 40 cryptocurrencies to 30+ fiat currencies instantly. Users send funds straight to bank accounts worldwide. No middlemen, no fuss, just a flat 1% fee. It’s a game-changer. Security backs Remittix’s appeal too. Regular audits by firms like BlockSAFU keep it tight. A three-year lock on team tokens builds trust. Shiba Inu price swings can’t match this kind of reliability and Investors are noticing the difference. Even early SHIB whales are eyeing Remittix. They see echoes of Shiba Inu’s explosive start. But RTX’s foundation feels stronger, less speculation, more substance. That’s a powerful draw in today’s market. Analysts peg Remittix for an 800% jump pre-launch. Post-launch, a $6 price isn’t far-fetched. That’s 100x from its current $0.0628. Shiba Inu price dreams of $1 seem distant by comparison as market data shows RTX’s momentum is undeniable. For SHIB holders, the switch is about future-proofing. Remittix isn’t just a token, it's a lifeline. It’s poised to redefine how money moves globally, making it a top pick for 2025’s savvy investors. Remittix’s Winning Edge Shines In $12.5 Million Funding Shiba Inu holders are trading meme dreams for Remittix’s real-world wins. At $0.0628, RTX blends speed, affordability and security in global payments. With Stage 1 investors already netting 400% ROI. Remittix’s $12.6 million presale fund screams success. For Shiba Inu investors and crypto whales seeking stability and explosive growth, Remittix is set to deliver big-time.

Nevertheless, the market offers several ideal digital asset investment options with the potential for notable returns. Wiith numerous cryptocurencies in the market, selecting the right one can, however, be a challenge. Fortunately, the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) platforms with roles in investment management has made it easier to gather insights for selecting the right assets. In this context, Finbold consulted xAI’s latest model, Grok 3, to create an ideal crypto portfolio for 2025. In developing the portfolio, Grok 3 focused on stability, growth, and risk mitigation, aiming to optimize returns while minimizing volatility. The model used an assumed initial investment of $10,000 for this exercise, allocating it across the following assets. Bitcoin (BTC) The AI model reaffirmed Bitcoin’s status as the foundation of the cryptocurrency market, highlighting its stability as a long-term investment. According to Grok, Bitcoin remains a strong bet, with projected growth in 2025. The AI set a conservative price range of $85,000 to $165,000, with bullish forecasts reaching $185,000. As a result, it recommended allocating 50% ($5,000) of the portfolio to Bitcoin. Grok 3 AI Bitcoin portfolio allocation. Source: X Notably, optimism within the crypto community has surged, particularly after Donald Trump’s election, given his pro-crypto stance. Investors are eyeing his promises, including integrating Bitcoin into the strategic reserve, as a potential catalyst for growth. A more favorable regulatory climate could fuel further capital inflows. To this end, Standard Chartered predicted that institutional investment could push Bitcoin to $200,000 by the end of 2025, a target echoed by Bernstein. As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $95,492, down 1.2% in the last 24 hours, while year-to-date, the leading digital currency has made modest gains of less than 1%. BTC YTD price chart. Source: Finbold Ethereum (ETH) Although Ethereum ( ETH ) has experienced a sharp price drop in the wake of the Bybit cryptocurrency exchange hack , Grok 3 recommended the decentralized finance ( DeFi ) asset as the second pick. The AI platform pointed out that the asset will likely grow more thanks to its ability to power decentralized applications, NFTs, and the DeFi ecosystem. It noted that the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, which introduced staking, is another growth catalyst. Regarding price movement, Grok 3 cited insights from analysts who foresee the second-ranked cryptocurrency by market cap trading in the range of $2,670 to $5,990, with a potential high of $6,660 by the end of 2025. Generally, the AI platform noted that Ethereum’s developer activity and expanding use cases strongly complement Bitcoin, proposing an allocation of 25%. By press time, ETH was trading at $2,784.60, down a modest 0.16% in the last 24 hours, while YTD, the asset is down over 18%. ETH YTD price chart. Source: Finbold Solana (SOL) On the other hand, Grok stated that Solana ( SOL ), with its high-speed blockchain and low fees, is emerging as a popular choice for Web3 projects. Forecasts suggest SOL could trade between $166 and $555 in 2025, with a stretch target of $725 if scalability improvements and potential ETF approvals materialize. Grok noted that the asset’s high-growth potential makes it an attractive investment. As reported by Finbold, some analysts, such as Ali Martinez, predict that SOL has the potential to rally to $1,000. Indeed, SOL has been among the standout assets in the past year, witnessing massive growth thanks to the network’s role in launching meme cryptocurrencies. This momentum has managed to put aside concerns about the network, such as extensive outages, which previously called into question Solana’s ability to compete with entities such as Ethereum. Grok recommended allocating 10% of the portfolio to the asset. Grok 3 AI Solana portfolio allocation. Source: X As of press time, Solana was trading at $167.41, down 3.7% on the daily chart, while YTD, SOL has plunged almost 16%. SOL YTD price chart. Source: Finbold Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink ( LINK ) was the last altcoin recommended by Grok, suggesting an allocation of 5%, noting that the cryptocurrency plays a crucial role as a decentralized oracle network, connecting smart contracts with real-world data, a vital function in the DeFi ecosystem. Grok stated that the asset finds a spot in the portfolio based on bullish projections likely to see LINK trade at $75 in 2025. Additionally, it noted that Chainlink’s expanding partnerships position it for further growth while setting an allocation of 5%. At the time of reporting, LINK was valued at $17.53, dropping 15% in 2025. LINK YTD price chart. Source: Finbold The AI tool also called for allocating 5% of the portfolio to stablecoins , such as USDT or USDC, to provide liquidity and a buffer against market volatility. In this regard, Grok 3 noted stablecoins allow for flexibility in capitalizing on market dips and taking profits. Crypto investment strategy for 2025 At the same time, Grok 3 shared several investment strategies to navigate the cryptocurrency market in 2025. Top on the list is dollar-cost averaging to smooth out price fluctuations and optimize entry points. Furthermore, taking profits when altcoins see significant gains can secure returns and allow reinvestment into stable assets. Regarding potential outcomes, Grok 3 outlined a conservative scenario where Bitcoin reaches $150,000, Ethereum hits $5,000, and altcoins grow modestly, leading to a portfolio value between $18,000 and $20,000. With Bitcoin potentially surging to $180,000, Ethereum surpassing $6,000, and altcoins seeing substantial growth, a bullish scenario could push the portfolio value beyond $30,000. In a bearish case, where a market correction causes major assets and altcoins to decline, the portfolio’s value could drop between $6,000 to $7,000, with stablecoins offering some protection.

PEPE coin price forecasts are still a heated issue; some see a boom while others caution of instability. Bold actions by Ethereum whales are moving money into initiatives with actual value and significant growth potential like Remittix . While meme coins like PEPE depend on community buzz, some tokens stand out for their robust foundations and revolutionary application use. Aware investors are piling up assets meant for long-term success while the market changes quickly. The issue is, which one should you be investing in? PEPE Coin Price: Can It Reach New Heights in 2025? With its zero taxes and consistent contract, PEPE the meme-inspired token has generated buzz in the crypto scene. Having a huge 420.69 trillion supply, its future is yet unknown. While some warn of significant declines due to market instability, others see a minor increase in February 2025. Should PEPE coin price reach $0.000073, it can attain a $30 billion market cap possible in a robust bull run. With 1.5 million daily transactions and future improvements like Pectra, Ethereum's strength supports PEPE. Still, a huge 20x increase seems improbable given current demand. Though this is conjecture rather than assurance, some X analysts estimate a 5x to 10x rise should meme currencies remain popular. The Volatile character of the market implies PEPE's price might move in any direction. According to @ali_charts , the number of large $PEPE transactions has dropped from 1,520 to just 155 over the last three months. Pepe Transaction Chart Constant price fluctuations are putting strain on the PEPE community as well. Many of the holders are thinking about other ventures that seem more steady or offer better profits. Although PEPE coin price might increase if the buzz keeps on, the erratic character of the market guarantees no result. In this always shifting terrain, investors should keep educated and wary. Why ETH Whales Are Choosing RTX Over PEPE Coin Price Hype Expecting great 20x profits, Ethereum (ETH) whales are betting large on RTX. Unlike the erratic swings in PEPE coin price, RTX provides actual value by quickly, low-cost transfers from over forty cryptocurrencies into FIAT. For large investors seeking long-term value instead of hype-driven speculation, this pragmatic use case appeals more. From its presale price of $0.0628, analysts estimate RTX might soar giving up to 190x gains. PEPE coin price projections, on the other hand, are significantly less certain since they mostly depend on market trends and community attitude. RTX's locked liquidity and audited system offer extra protection, therefore guaranteeing investor confidence. Although PEPE and other meme currencies show fast increases, their long-term stability is yet dubious. RTX is scheduled to show on main centralised exchanges (CEXs) like Binance as well as Uniswap. These listings will raise awareness and make trading more easily available, therefore attracting even more investors. RTX has great momentum and evidence that major buyers believe in its future since over $12.6 million has already been raised in presale. Demand as accessibility increases can drive costs further higher. For investors looking for long-term gains, its PayFi approach guarantees value, so it is a safer option. RTX might have a dramatic increase once it starts on big exchanges, rewarding early holders in ways meme currencies usually fall short of sustaining. The Next Big Crypto Winner Who Will Come Out on Top? Meme coins against utility-driven tokens is a fiercely fought conflict. Though PEPE coin price forecasts inspire traders, the market is seeking more than simply buzz. Already making investments, Ethereum whales are choosing assets with actual stability and answers. Strong liquidity, massive exchange listings and creative use cases are redefining crypto investments going forward. Those that arrive early on the correct ventures stand to benefit most. Whether it's solid utility or meme-driven momentum, the market is changing and you will be wise to act before the next major breakthrough by choosing Remittix.

According to Bloomberg , Milei spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Milei played to the audience by referencing former President Donald Trump’s stance on reciprocal tariffs. The crowd ate it up. But there’s a catch: Argentina’s membership in Mercosur, the South American trade bloc, is putting a damper on his ambitions. You might also like: LIBRA coin team explored Nigeria for meme coin launch before the Javier Milei scandal “I want to take this chance to announce that Argentina wants to be the first country in the world to join this reciprocal accord that the Trump administration proposed on trade matters,” Milei said. “If we were not restricted by Mercosur, Argentina would already be working on a mutually beneficial free trade deal with the United States.” Milei, 54, has made no secret of his admiration for Trump, 78. During his speech, Milei doubled down on his commitment to slashing government bureaucracy, just as Trump and Elon Musk have done through the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency. Trump, in return, gave Milei a shoutout in his own speech later that day, before the two met for a sit-down that might have offered the Argentine leader a brief break from domestic headaches. What caused those headaches? The Libra controversy recently landed Milei in hot water. Federal prosecutor Eduardo Taiano is reportedly sniffing around Milei’s recent endorsement of the meme coin on social media. Per La Nación, an investigation request has been filed. Libra fell 90% in value after Milei hyped it up. Similarly, Trump’s meme coin, Official Trump ( TRUMP ), is currently down over 78% from its all-time high . But Milei didn’t just spend his Washington trip talking trade and crypto drama—he also squeezed in meetings with Musk and International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva. With Georgieva, the focus was on Argentina’s ongoing IMF debt deal, a crucial piece of his economic puzzle. Whether Milei gets his wish for a U.S.-Argentina trade pact remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: he’s putting himself in the spotlight, whether on stage, online, or across the negotiating table.

Litecoin’s shine is fading too. Litecoin has been absent from mainstream media for a long time. Meanwhile there is an innovative altcoin with big potential that has taken the media by storm. Could this top Defi project outpace these crypto giants? Investors think so and let us find out why. Shiba Inu Price Drives Strong Community Enthusiasm. Many traders discuss Shiba Inu Price on social media as SHIB developers launch new projects to boost Shiba Inu Price. Recent ecosystem news highlights increased activity aroundShiba Inu Price. Shiba Inu price sits at $0.000015 on February 22 . That’s a far cry from its $0.000088 peak. Ecosystem news isn’t rosy—whales dumped 88% of their stash lately and Shiba Inu’s market cap hovers at $9 billion. Investors note that despite its meme origins, Shiba Inu Price remains volatile. Some predict that Shiba Inu Price could rise if new integrations occur. However, many are exploring alternatives beyond Shiba Inu for stable growth. Shiba Inu Price fluctuations often attract short-term speculators. The token’s community is vibrant but sometimes overly reactive. Analysts at Coincodex expect the volatility to lead Shiba Inu prices on a bear run, hitting $0.000013, and marking a 15% loss in May. Technical charts show resistance at $0.000018 holding firm. Without big catalysts, Shiba Inu price predictions lean bearish. Could it slip from the top 20 by 2025? Some say yes, eyeing fresher bets like Remittix. Litecoin’s Fading Glow: Analysts Expect Major Turnarounds Soon Litecoin (LTC) trades at $127.20 today with a $9.7 billion market cap. It’s ranked 21st—teetering near the edge. Ecosystem news flags a 122,000 holder surge, yet a 4% daily dip stings. ETF filings from Monochrome and Grayscale spark buzz, per Crypto Daily. Trade volume hit $539 million recently, up 15%. Still, Litecoin’s RSI nears 62—growth room exists, but competition from new coins looms large. Once a mining darling, Litecoin’s hash rate climbs, says CoinGape. But its old-school vibe struggles against flashier rivals. Analysts peg a $193 ceiling by April, yet a crowded market threatens its top 20 status. Analysts at Coincodex think Litecoin’s absence from the news is doing its blockchain a disservice and expect prices to drop to $110 in May. Remittix Is Promising Fast Secure Cross Border Transactions Remittix (RTX) currently sells at $0.0628 in its new ICO. Remittix is a PayFi project tackling global payment problems. Its presale has hauled in over $12.5 million and sold more than 470 million RTX tokens already. Investors see a 50x surge by 2025—could it crack the top 20? Unlike Shiba Inu’s hype, Remittix delivers real use. It swaps 40+ cryptos into 30+ fiats instantly. Funds land in bank accounts worldwide fast, with just a 1% fee. Traditional systems can’t touch that speed. Remittix has a core technology, its Pay API, which allows businesses to take crypto and settle instantly in FIAT, no sweat. It’s a practical fix for volatility fears. Litecoin and SHIB holders are noticing, drawn by RTX’s $190 trillion market target. Security’s tight with BlockSAFU audits and a three-year team token lock. Remittix’sroadmap eyes exchange listings soon. Partnerships with payment firms are boosting its reach especially to investors fleeing meme chaos. SHIB’s 584 trillion circulating supply dwarfs RTX’s 1.5 billion cap. Scarcity fuels Remittix’sappeal and as demand grows RTX price could skyrocket. Investors are confident Remittix's practical achievements will lead to a top 20 market position during 2025 despite the lack of meme-related popularity.

This bearish signal, confirmed on Dogecoin’s February chart, has holders on edge. Many fear a sharp slide is coming. Meanwhile, a new Ripple (XRP) rival beckons with 10x potential by March. The death cross—when the 50-day moving average dips below the 200-day—spells caution. Historically, it’s led to steep drops for DOGE, like 26% and 44%. Investors are rattled, searching for safer bets. This new PayFi competitor is quietly gaining traction as the best cryptocurrency to buy amid current market uncertainties. DOGE Price Prediction Has Investors Worried: Will Dogecoin Ever Surge To $1? Today, Dogecoin trades at $0.25, down 66% from its $0.73 peak in 2021. The circulating supply sits at 147.85 billion tokens, with a $36.6 billion market cap . Dogecoin (DOGE) is buzzing with a 34% surge in active addresses, hitting 6.57 million monthly, signaling stronger adoption. DOGE is up 0.77% in the past 24 hours, with volumes jumping 28.9% to $1.41 billion. Elon Musk’s influence once fueled DOGE’s meteoric rise. Now, even his Department of Government Efficiency role isn’t lifting spirits. Social buzz on X has faded 11% weekly. The meme coin’s charm is dimming as real-world use lags. Technical charts paint a grim picture for DOGE. The death cross confirms bearish momentum. DOGE price prediction experts warn of volatility ahead, pushing investors toward fresher options. However, analysts are optimistic that Dogecoin price will double in the next 3 months, fueledby ETF hopes from Grayscale and Bitwise. DOGE price prediction models suggest a rise to $0.44 come May . Yet, as DOGE clings below key support, some holders eye Remittix (RTX), a PayFi token at $0.0628 tipped for a 10x rise by March. XRP Price Slips Below $2.60: Volatility Looms Amid Macro Pressures and Whale Moves XRP's price dropped below $2.60 on February 22. The token encountered a substantial barrier after its 400% price spike during the previous year by losing more than 3% value in the past 24 hours. XRP trading volumes reached $6.58 billion which led to a 12.5% price increase to $2.75 during the initial part of this month. The market faces potential regression due to macroeconomic factors particularly Trump's tariff discussions. The on-chain metrics of XRP indicate potential resistance against market volatility. Active XRP addresses have reached 6.57 million monthly, while whale outflows of $75 million continue. Technical analysts predict $2.90 as the key resistance point that could limit XRP's upcoming gains while the support level stands at $2.40. They expect XRP to reach $3.43 in May. Remittix Is 2025’s Rising Star With $12.6 million raised in presale, Remittix offers instant crypto-to-fiat swaps, drawing DOGE fans seeking stability and utility over meme-driven volatility While DOGE price predictions falter and Ripple seeks to consolidate, Remittix (RTX) shines at $0.0628.

Aggregator data places Solana near $170–$175, with a 24-hour volume hovering around $3.7 billion, reflecting steady but not explosive interest. Meanwhile, the chain has seen a wave of meme tokens like BONK and WIF capturing short-term hype but struggling for lasting traction. In parallel, an emerging altcoin known for real-world use—Remittix is drawing capital from whales and small investors seeking more than comedic branding. Below, we break down how meme mania is influencing Solana sentiment and why utility sensation RTX is luring attention away from tokens anchored in transient social-media buzz. SOL and Meme Tokens Struggle for Stability Despite Solana’s vaunted speed and past DeFi expansions, aggregator data shows its daily volume declined by about 12% last month, sparking concern that user enthusiasm may be waning. SOL’s decline Some watchers point to Solana meme coins, BONK and WIF, which soared on initial hype but now face declining volumes as the novelty wears off. Meme-driven tokens often rely on influencer tweets or viral marketing, leaving them vulnerable to abrupt sell-offs once a new trend arrives. This volatility can cast an overall shadow on Solana, as potential newcomers fear the chain is too meme-focused. Even if SOL’s technology remains robust, short attention spans in crypto can undermine confidence unless real utility emerges. Why Meme Coins Fall Short Meme coins on Solana, such as BONK and WIF, launched with comedic themes and minor DeFi add-ons, grabbing headlines with massive percentage gains in hours. Yet aggregator data shows volumes dipping 40–50% after that initial rush, highlighting how fleeting meme cycles can be. Without robust liquidity or deeper functionality, many joke tokens falter. This creates an uneasy environment for Solana, which aims to be a top-tier blockchain for DeFi and NFTs. Observers argue that overreliance on comedic projects can stall the chain’s broader adoption. Some whales thus rotate funds into tokens that solve actual problems, hoping for stable growth rather than ephemeral mania. Remittix (RTX): The Utility Sensation Changing Dynamics As Solana price analysis warns of lingering meme distractions, a PayFi-focused altcoin called Remittix has soared past $11 million in presale , drawing attention for bridging crypto with real-world finance. Instead of comedic branding, Remittix targets the $190 trillion global remittance sector, addressing a universal pain point: expensive wire fees that often exceed 5–10%. Families, freelancers, and migrant workers stand to gain if Remittix’s on- and off-ramps reduce these costs. Critics note the token must secure regulatory compliance and user-friendly apps to fulfill this promise. However, the scale of cross-border transactions suggests a vast potential user base that dwarfs typical meme coin audiences. If successful, Remittix might overshadow smaller tokens on Solana by offering a proven utility that meme coins simply can’t match. Investors Pivot to Practical Solutions Data reveals a pattern: while Solana meme coins spike on launch, the hype dissipates if no additional value underpins their brand. In contrast, utility sensation RTX can continue attracting investors by offering direct financial benefits. Unlike BONK or WIF, Remittix doesn’t hinge on social-media waves for momentum. Instead, it provides near-instant, low-fee crypto-to-fiat swaps, a feature aggregator data indicates more whales appreciate when seeking consistent returns. By locking liquidity for three years and renouncing the contract post-presale, Remittix aims to reduce rug-pull risks. Some watchers believe bridging a $190 trillion sector could yield 30x or 50x gains if adoption scales globally. This real-world approach appeals to many, especially in an environment where comedic tokens rarely sustain lasting user engagement. A Fork in the Road for Solana and Beyond While Solana price analysis highlights the network’s advanced capabilities, the presence of meme tokens BONK and WIF complicates its reputation. Unless SOL manages to entice broader user adoption via DeFi or NFTs, volumes may remain tepid. Meanwhile, utility sensation RTX underlines an alternative path—addressing a glaring issue (cross-border fees) with a PayFisolution that resonates across various demographics. Of course, each route carries risks. Solana must ensure DeFi expansions overshadow meme distractions, and Remittix must overcome licensing and user-interface hurdles. Still, bridging digital assets with day-to-day finances has more durable appeal than comedic branding, suggesting tokens solving actual pain points might command market favor in 2025. If you’re seeking a token that prioritizes practical solutions, explore the Remittix presale at Remittix , and follow official updates or community channels at Linktree . Whether SOL recovers or meme coins fade, PayFi projects like Remittix look poised to define the next wave of mainstream crypto adoption.

Former policewoman Courtney White says she lost $87,000 to a thief who impersonated her and made withdrawals from her JPMorgan Chase account to the tune of thousands of dollars per day, reports NBC 5 Chicago. White says she deliberately opened an account with JPMorgan with no debit cards or checks to help her build a nest egg. But the impersonator emptied her account by going to various JPMorgan branches and making withdrawals in the flesh. She says she had no idea that someone was taking money out of her account until she received an “insufficient funds” alert, prompting her to check her account balance months after the thief began looting her funds. “Somebody should have recognized that this is an outrageous amount of transactions every day. It should have been… some sort of alert. I’ve never banked like that. And like I said, I’ve had Chase for 20 years.” White says she abruptly reported the theft to the police and filed reimbursement claims with JPMorgan. But the lender denied her claims, saying that she failed to report the fraud within 30 days of receiving her bank statement. Says JPMorgan in a statement, “We will cooperate with any investigation, as we always do. As we remind all customers, it is important to review your monthly statements and if you see any unauthorized transactions to let us know right away. We provide customers with many steps to boost account security, including setting up account alerts to receive notifications whenever there’s a purchase or withdrawal from your account that’s over a certain amount.” White also says JPMorgan won’t provide surveillance footage that could help identify the impersonator, and the bank says it only keeps video recordings for a certain amount of time.

Coinbase executive Conor Grogan calls the attack the biggest theft in recorded history. “The NK (North Korea) hack of Bybit is the largest heist of all time, of any medium (Central Bank of Iraq heist was ~$1 billion).

Even if this hack loss is not recovered, all client assets are 1 to 1 backed, and we can cover the loss.” In an update, Zhou says that Bybit had managed to process all withdrawal requests without experiencing any major issues. “12 hours from the worst hack in history.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.98 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $6.46. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.64 Market cap $666,482,283.29 Trading volume $226,470,620.53 Circulating supply 998,841,285.64 WIF All-time high $4.85 on March 31, 2024 All-time low $0.000023 on November 2023 24-hour high $0.7175 24-hour low $0.6588 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 31.51% 50-day SMA $1.302 14-Day RSI 32.81 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 55 (Greed) Green days 5/30 (17%) 200-Day SMA $2.13 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis: WIF to break past resistance at $0.714? TL;DR Breakdown WIF is currently in the oversold region. Dogwifhat (WIF) resistance is present at around $0.714. WIF’s immediate support level is present at $0.689. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: WIF struggles to break out of bearish trend The 1-day chart for WIF on February 23 shows the coin trading below the 20, 50, and 200-day SMA, and struggling to recover from a prolonged bearish trend. WIF gained some momentum but hit resistance at $0.7174, causing a decline to the $0.65 – $0.66 range. The MACD, on the other hand, suggests growing buying momentum, as the MACD line is above the signal line. WIF struggles to break out of a bearish trend The RSI indicates the asset is in oversold territory, hinting at a potential bounce provided buyers pump in liquidity. A break above $0.797 is needed to confirm any signs of recovery, while a drop below the $0.584 support region could result in a further decline towards $0.4. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart: WIF shows consolidation after a minor upside The 4-hour WIF/USDT chart suggests possible short-term consolidation after a minor upside. Dogwifhat currently trades just above the middle Bollinger Band (a short-term support level). A bounce from this level could lead to another attempt at the $0.714 resistance level. WIF shows consolidation after a minor upside The Balance of Power (BOP) suggests that the bulls are gaining some hold on the market. However, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicates money outflows, which could limit any potential upside in the short term. WIF needs to recapture the $0.714 price level and break past resistance at $0.729 to confirm the position of the BOP indicator. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.9493 SELL SMA 5 $0.8380 SELL SMA 10 $0.8523 SELL SMA 21 $0.8080 SELL SMA 50 $1.3028 SELL SMA 100 $2.06 SELL SMA 200 $2.13 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.8809 SELL EMA 5 $1.0557 SELL EMA 10 $1.3213 SELL EMA 21 $1.6356 SELL EMA 50 $2.08 SELL EMA 100 $2.29 SELL EMA 200 $2.29 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? The broader outlook for WIF is bearish. In the meantime, a recapture and breakout of the $0.714 – $0.797 price level is needed to confirm a possible bullish reversal, while a long-term push above the 50-day SMA at $1.143 could signal a sustainable uptrend. A failed bullish attempt could result in further price declines towards $0.584. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain. Its value is driven by community interest and speculation. Projections indicate that by 2025, the price could recover to about $1.5. While it may have potential for short-term gains, it’s equally risky. Only invest after thorough research. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank and several others. Why is $WIF down? WIF is down after facing rejection at $0.7174. The coin is down due to diminishing market interest and folding liquidity triggered by massive selloffs and a shift to other assets that investors consider more profitable. Dogwifhat (WIF) price chart | Coinmarketcap Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1.5 by 2025 and about $6 to $8 by 2031.

As reported by The Block in a now-deleted X post, Ye teased about a token, “Swasticoin” and launched his blockchain. He reportedly rejected a $2 million proposal to promote a crypto scheme. Will Ye Launch a Controversial Token? In a series of posts, Ye suggested he could launch the Swasticoin next week. This development suggests that the rap artist has backtracked on a previous post where he disassociated himself from such projects. On that occasion, Ye referred to it as a project that “prey on the fans with hype.” The U.S. rapper even used strong language against non-fungible tokens on Instagram. He stated his lack of interest in buying NFTs. The name appears deliberate and continues his controversial stance on certain sensitive issues. The name Swasticoin is a further push to offend the Jewish community, as he has done in recent times. In one of the now-deleted posts, Ye suggested he would open a “contract address,” CA, for his Swasticoin to Jewish people, as well as family and friends. Ye said, “Let’s see if stereotypes exist for a reason.” Ye Connects with Changpeng Zhao Aside from talks about Swasticoin, Ye also made inquiries about blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and BNB Chain, among others. The queries were in response to Ye’s followers suggesting the network on which to launch Swasticoin. It also looked like Ye tried to contact Changpeng “CZ” Zhao , co-founder of Binance. The American rapper, active on X, even reposted one of CZ’s posts. Notably, the post from CZ had complained about the difficulty in using decentralized exchanges compared to their centralized counterparts. Interestingly, CZ is among the only two people Ye follows on X despite having over 33 million followers. Kanye West and Crypto, Here’s Possible Reason YE might launch a token and keep 70% of the total supply for himself. Some have suggested that the token will help users overcome Shopify’s censorship of the Yeezy store. It remains unclear if it is the same project or a different one. Notably, reports from sources close to the artist say the token will be called YZY. However, this is not the first time that YE has flirted with controversy. He sold a shirt with a Swastika symbol on his website titled HH-01, apparently short for “Heil Hitler. The website has been taken down.

Specifically, the SHIB token has experienced impressive growth, increasing in value by roughly 65% in the past year. However, the current uncertain climate has not spared any large-cap meme token, including Shiba Inu, with deep corrections and sluggish sideways movement plaguing most of the market in the past two months. As large investors now seem to be exiting the market, this dour condition might persist longer than expected. $1 Million SHIB Transactions On A Steady Decline In a post on the X platform, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that the whale class of Shiba Inu investors has become less active in the past three months. This on-chain observation is based on Santiment’s Whale Transaction Count metric, which tracks the number of SHIB transactions worth more than $1 million. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Prediction: Extremely Strong Support And Monthly 55 EMA Says ETH Is Headed For $4,867 Whales refer to entities or individuals that hold significant amounts of a specific crypto asset (Shiba Inu, in this scenario). Crypto whales are often considered key players in the market, as their buying or selling activities can have a significant impact on the SHIB price; thereby resulting in speculation and potential market shifts. According to Martinez, there has been a 79% dip in the activity of the SHIB whales on the Shiba Inu network, suggesting a possible shift in investor sentiment. A steady decline in whale activity often indicates decreased confidence or interest from major holders, especially as they look to rotate into other assets. As seen with the recent Shiba Inu price action, a sustained downturn in large whale transactions is also often associated with a corresponding decline in value and intermittent sideways movement. Hence, if the price of Shiba Inu is to resurrect from its market slump, whale activity on the network would need to pick up as quickly as possible. Shiba Inu Price Overview As of this writing, the SHIB token is valued at around $0.0000156, reflecting an almost 3% price jump in the past 24 hours. While Shiba Inu seems to be consolidating around the $0.000015 level for most of February, the meme coin is yet to fully recover from its recent plunge toward $0.000012 earlier in the month. According to CoinGecko data, the second-largest meme coin is still down by more than 20% in the last 30 days. Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu price has shrunk by nearly 50% in the past three months.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Top traders are betting big on Catzilla, a meme coin with kaiju-inspired flair, as it gears up to rival past sensations like Fartcoin. Table of Contents Catzilla: A meme coin with high growth potential Fartcoin: Trading digital humor with unique sounds Conclusion In the ever-changing world of cryptocurrency, a new player is catching the attention of savvy traders. With the market in full bull run mode, experts are showing keen interest in Catzilla, a new project that might surge to incredible heights. Drawing parallels with past high-flyers, the intrigue around whether it could mirror the massive returns from past sensations is palpable. Catzilla: A meme coin with high growth potential Catzilla is one of those projects that seems too wild to ignore — a mix of Japanese kaiju culture, internet memes, and crypto. At first glance, it might just seem like another meme token, but there’s more going on under the hood. With a structured presale and a growing community, Catzilla has some actual momentum behind it. Instead of a typical one-shot token sale, Catzilla’s presale is broken into 14 stages, giving investors multiple chances to buy in before launch. As each stage progresses, the price ticks up, meaning early buyers get in at a lower cost. Current presale stats: Current price: $0.0009 Next stage price: $0.0010 Final presale price: $0.0016 Funds raised so far: $2.2m and climbing Right now, the presale is in Stage 7, and the CoinMarketCap community seems optimistic about where it’s headed. Since the price keeps increasing with each stage, some investors are getting in now to lock in a lower price before the token hits exchanges. What makes Catzilla different? Plenty of meme coins rely purely on hype, but this one has a few things going for it besides viral appeal. 1. There’s a unique concept A big part of the project revolves around a kaiju-style concept. Its mascot is a giant cat that destroys cities and earns rewards. 2. It’s tapping into multiple communities Catzilla is clearly designed to appeal to more than just crypto traders. The mix of anime, gaming, and meme culture makes it something that could attract: Crypto investors looking for early-stage projects. Meme lovers who enjoy viral, internet-driven trends. Anime and gaming fans who like the kaiju-inspired theme. The mix of audiences could help sustain interest in the long term. 3. There’s a strong focus on community involvement A big part of the project is community engagement, whether it’s through governance voting, staking rewards, or the play-to-earn mechanics in the game. The more people participate, the more active the ecosystem becomes — which could help with long-term sustainability. The presale is moving along quickly, and since the price keeps increasing in stages, there’s a time factor involved. Like any meme coin, it’s a speculative play — there’s potential for major upside, but also risks, especially in a volatile market. That said, the combination of an actual game, community engagement, and a structured presale makes Catzilla interesting. Whether it turns into a big winner depends on how well its roadmap is executed, but it’s one to keep an eye on.

Users can submit fart jokes or memes to claim their initial tokens. Each transaction creates a digital fart sound through its unique “Gas Fee” system. Fartcoin can be traded on several centralized crypto exchanges. Bitget is the most popular choice, with a high trading pair volume of $66,370,105 in the last 24 hours for FARTCOIN/USDT. KuCoin and Ourbit are also popular for trading. While trading volume is significant, the appeal lies in its novel concept. The ability to turn humor into a cryptocurrency adds a unique angle to the market. This could attract traders looking for fun and innovation. Conclusion While coins like FARTCOIN may have less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as a meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom to everyone. Offering a 700% ROI during its presale — from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages — and featuring triple utility through governance, incentives, and staking options, Catzilla unites crypto enthusiasts, meme fans, and anime lovers. The project invites participation by acquiring CATZILLA tokens and joining the battle against crypto villains. For more information on Catzilla, visit the website , Twitter , or Telegram News .

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Inspired by Shiba Inu’s success, BeerBear enters the meme coin arena, eyeing a potential breakout to $0.01. Table of Contents How SHIB’s growth sets a precedent for new meme coins BeerBear’s entry into the market Conclusion The cryptocurrency market has witnessed several meme coins rise from obscurity to mainstream recognition, with Shiba Inu (SHIB) being one of the most prominent success stories. Initially launched as a decentralized experiment, SHIB’s journey from a low-value token to a widely traded asset has inspired new projects looking to replicate its trajectory. Among the latest entrants into the meme coin space, BeerBear has emerged as a strong contender, combining play-to-earn mechanics with a structured ecosystem to capture investor interest. How SHIB’s growth sets a precedent for new meme coins SHIB’s success was largely driven by its strong community support, strategic tokenomics, and accessibility to retail investors. Despite being labeled as a meme coin, SHIB has expanded its ecosystem through initiatives like ShibaSwap and token burns, reinforcing long-term value for holders. The ability to create a narrative that extends beyond hype has been a defining factor in SHIB’s growth, setting a benchmark for new projects entering the market. BeerBear’s entry into the market Taking inspiration from the likes of SHIB, BeerBear is leveraging a structured ecosystem that integrates play-to-earn gaming incentives with decentralized governance. Unlike traditional meme coins that rely solely on market speculation, BeerBear incorporates utility through its arcade-style game, “Bar Brawl.” This interactive model allows players to earn in-game tokens and NFTs, adding layers of engagement beyond trading activity. Another critical factor is BeerBear’s structured presale model. The token started at $0.0004 and is set to reach $0.0020 by the final presale stage. This planned growth model rewards early participants while ensuring gradual market entry rather than a sudden speculative surge. Additionally, BeerBear’s Beer Points system provides additional incentives, enabling users to accumulate points that can be redeemed for ecosystem benefits. You might also like: Evaluating the future of a crypto coin that could see notable growth Security and transparency: Key to investor confidence As meme coin markets often see volatility, security and transparency remain crucial for investor confidence. BeerBear has undergone three independent security audits, distinguishing it from many emerging projects that forgo such verifications. These audits ensure that the smart contract framework remains secure and reliable, mitigating potential risks for token holders. With increasing regulatory attention on meme-based projects, transparency in operations and compliance measures will likely become essential for long-term adoption. Can BeerBear follow SHIB’s path to $0.01? While SHIB’s meteoric rise to prominence was unprecedented, BeerBear’s structured approach suggests a different pathway to potential success. The combination of gaming incentives, a transparent presale model, and community-driven engagement positions BeerBear as more than a speculative asset. However, its growth will ultimately depend on market adoption, sustained interest, and broader sentiment toward interactive blockchain ecosystems. Experts suggest that meme coins with integrated utilities are more likely to sustain long-term interest than those relying purely on social media hype. If BeerBear continues to develop its gaming model and strengthens its community engagement, it could follow a trajectory similar to SHIB’s, positioning itself as one of the next-generation meme coins with tangible use cases. Conclusion The emergence of BeerBear demonstrates how meme coins are evolving beyond their initial speculative nature. Inspired by SHIB’s success, BeerBear introduces structured growth mechanics, interactive gaming incentives, and a transparent ecosystem aimed at long-term adoption. While reaching $0.01 will depend on multiple market factors, BeerBear’s model suggests a more sustainable approach. As the meme coin landscape continues to expand, projects that balance engagement with tangible utility are likely to capture investor interest and community support.

Even in a tough bear market, Lightchain AI’s technology keeps it ahead, attracting investors seeking long-term growth. Table of Contents Bear market pressures shake up the crypto landscape Lightchain AI’s technology sets it apart from competition Conclusion Despite the challenges of a harsh bear market, Lightchain AI continues to stand out as a promising option. While many cryptocurrencies struggle to maintain value, Lightchain AI’s unique blend of AI and blockchain technology has captured the attention of investors seeking long-term growth. Its presale success, with $16.1 million raised at $0.006 per token, reflects strong confidence in its future potential. Bear market pressures shake up the crypto landscape The cryptocurrency market remains highly unpredictable. Bitcoin is currently valued at $95,860, marking a slight 0.78% decline, with intraday fluctuations between $95,685 and $96,815. Ethereum follows a similar trend, trading at $2,812.28, up 3.22%, with a daily high of $2,831.84 and a low of $2,723.93. XRP has seen a decline of 0.82% to $2.56, with a daily low of $2.54 and a high of $2.61. Despite the somewhat positive shifts, the broader market is grappling with significant headwinds. Soaring inflation has sparked fears of interest rate hikes, potentially tightening liquidity and discouraging investments in risk-heavy assets like crypto. Regulatory crackdowns and escalating geopolitical tensions also continue to add to market instability, raising questions about the long-term growth prospects of major digital currencies.

CZ is mulling an outright donation to a non-profit, but the options of burning tokens or adding them to a liquidity pool are appealing alternatives. CZ Set To Give Out $1 Million In a post on X (formerly Twitter), CZ confirmed that donations for victims of Test (TST) and BROCCOLI meme coins had surpassed the $1 million mark. From the pool, CZ donated $100K (150 BNB), riding on the tailwind from a university student’s donations for victims of the ill-fated Libra project. The Binance founder disclosed that he will not keep any of the BNB received but will seek community opinion on an appropriate means to give out the tokens. Right out the bat, CZ shut down suggestions that he will send tokens to individuals, citing an inability to verify claims while hinting at a community-focused action. A cross-section of community members are pining for a non-profit donation in line with CZ’s streak of crypto-backed charity activities in recent months. While a donation to a non-profit sits at the top of the pyramid, CZ says the organization must have mechanisms for transparency for funds. “My requirement for charity is that the receiving organization has to be crypto-enabled, and tracking must be allowed to the end beneficiary,” wrote CZ. Binance Founder Eyes A Hybrid Approach CZ opines that a hybrid approach may be the best route for giving out the donated BNB tokens. A portion of the funds may be given to a non-profit that ticks the boxes of transparency while others are pushing for burning the received tokens, potentially increasing asset values. The founder notes that he is leaning toward deploying the funds to a liquidity pool after initial experiments birthed positive results. “I don’t care if funds on this address make or lose money,” said CZ on the prospects of a liquidity pool. “I think this is an indirect way to give back to our community too.” While airdrops have received a level of community support, CZ sees their implementation as a steep mountain to climb for wallet operators. He predicts that selecting eligible individuals for the airdrop will trigger a raging debate among community members.

Mantra ( OM ), which hopes to become the biggest crypto in the real world asset or RWA industry, has soared from $0.0158 in January 2024 to $9.10. This surge has moved its market cap from $29 million in January 2024 to $8.45 billion today. Mantra has jumped after launching MantraChain in 2024. MantraChain hopes to become the biggest layer 1 network for the RWA industry. Last week, the developers launched RWAccelerator , which they hope to fund developers in the industry. Mantra also owns MANTRA Zone, a gateway to the chain, where users complete onchain missions and boost reward allocations. These users receive regular airdrops, which helps them boost their income, especially now that the OM price is surging. Mantra price has also roared because of its strong staking rewards, which are higher than other networks like Ethereum ( ETH ) and Near Protocol ( NEAR ). Most OM validators pay an average staking yield of 5.50%. OM staking yields | Source: Mantra Zone There are a few reasons why the OM price will reverse soon. First, there is an ongoing divergence between Mantra and the futures open interest.

That divergence is a sign that investors in the futures market are paring back their bets on the coin. OM open interest | Source: CoinGlass Mantra price technicals point to a retreat OM price chart | Source: crypto.news Second, the OM price may retreat because of the concept of mean reversion. This is a concept that states that an asset will always return to its historical averages now that it has deviated significantly from them. For example, the 50-week moving average is at $2.65, while the 100-day average is at $1.64. In this case, the mean reversion concept hints that the price will move back to these averages over time. Third, Mantra price is still in the markup phase of the Wyckoff Method. The chart above shows that it remained in a consolidation phase between 2020 and 2024. This consolidation was part of the accumulation. It then entered the markup phase in 2024, which is now going on. This phase is usually followed by the distribution and then markdown where an asset retreats. Fourth, there are signs that the Mantra token is getting overbought. The Relative Strength Index has moved to the extreme overbought point at 87, while the Stochastic RSI is nearing the overbought level. These are signs that the momentum may start waning. Therefore, there is a likelihood that the Mantra price may drop, at least to the next key support level at $4.58, its highest swing on Dec. 9. Mantra: From DeFi to tokenized assets Launched in 2020 by John Patrick Mullin, Will Corkin, and Rodrigo Quan Miranda, the project initially gained traction as Mantra DAO, emphasizing community-driven governance and cross-chain interoperability. Originally built on Polkadot’s Substrate framework, Mantra has expanded across multiple blockchain networks, including Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. It offers users opportunities to stake OM tokens, earn yield, and participate in lending and borrowing markets. Recently, Mantra has pivoted toward regulated financial services, securing a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license in Abu Dhabi. This move positions it as a leader in tokenizing real-world assets, bridging the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) and DeFi. By integrating RWAs like real estate and financial instruments, Mantra is pioneering compliant and scalable blockchain solutions.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Whales are shifting from TRX and ADA, eyeing Catzilla — a rising meme coin with a 12,500% surge potential. Table of Contents Catzilla: A meme coin with serious growth potential TRON and its role in decentralized content Cardano’s dual-layer functionality Conclusion In the latest market buzz, significant holders of Tron (TRX) and Cardano (ADA) are moving their focus toward a rising star in the meme coin world offering incredible growth potential. This shift marks an intriguing trend during the current market upswing, highlighting the lure of massive gains in an evolving landscape. Enthusiasts and investors are eager to uncover the reasons behind this transition and the opportunities it presents. Catzilla: A meme coin with serious growth potential Catzilla is one of those projects that seems too wild to ignore — a mix of Japanese kaiju culture, internet memes, and crypto. At first glance, it might just seem like another meme token, but there’s more going on under the hood. With a structured presale and a growing community, Catzilla has some actual momentum behind it. Instead of a typical one-shot token sale, Catzilla’s presale is broken into 14 stages, giving investors multiple chances to buy in before launch. As each stage progresses, the price ticks up, meaning early buyers get in at a lower cost. Current presale stats: Current price: $0.0009 Next stage price: $0.0010 Final presale price: $0.0016 Funds raised so far: $2.2m+ Right now, it’s at Stage 7, and the CoinMarketCap community seems optimistic about where it’s headed. Since the price keeps increasing with each stage, investors are locking in a lower price before the token hits exchanges. What makes Catzilla different? Plenty of meme coins rely purely on hype, but this one has a few things going for it besides just viral appeal. 1. There’s a unique concept A big part of the project revolves around a kaiju-style concept. Its mascot is a giant cat that destroys cities and earns rewards. 2. Tapping into multiple communities Catzilla is clearly designed to appeal to more than just crypto traders. The mix of anime, gaming, and meme culture makes it something that could attract: Crypto investors looking for early-stage projects. Meme lovers who enjoy viral, internet-driven trends. Anime and gaming fans who like the kaiju-inspired theme. This mix of audiences could help sustain interest in the long term. 3. Focus on community involvement A big part of the project is community engagement, whether it’s through governance voting, staking rewards, or the play-to-earn mechanics in the game. The more people participate, the more active the ecosystem becomes — which could help with long-term sustainability. You might also like: Top Traders go all in on CATZILLA, could it be the next meme coin to rocket like FARTCOIN? The presale is moving along quickly, and since the price keeps increasing in stages, there’s a time factor involved. Like any meme coin, it’s a speculative play — there’s potential for major upside, but also risks, especially in a volatile market. That said, the combination of an actual game, community engagement, and a structured presale makes Catzilla more interesting than meme coins that pop up and disappear. Nonetheless, whether Catzilla turns into a big winner depends on how well its roadmap is executed. TRON and its role in decentralized content TRON is a blockchain-based system developed by the Tron Foundation, starting in 2017. It transitioned from Ethereum to its platform in 2018. TRON’s main focus is giving digital content creators more rights and rewards. Instead of using middlemen like YouTube, creators can get direct payments from users. TRON supports smart contracts, various blockchains, and decentralized apps (dApps). Its transaction model is similar to Bitcoin, using a public ledger for tracking. TRON aims to build a decentralized internet and offers an alternative to Ethereum. Developers can build and share dApps on TRON with lower transaction costs. This approach benefits creators and consumers, potentially increasing TRON’s appeal in the market.

ADA is its native cryptocurrency and offers an eco-friendly alternative to ETH. Cardano uses a proof-of-stake system called Ouroboros, which consumes less energy than traditional proof-of-work models. The platform is also split into two layers: the Settlement Layer for transactions and the Computing Layer for smart contracts. This approach boosts its transaction capacity, potentially reaching up to a million per second. Introduced in March 2021, Cardano’s native tokens allow secure, low-cost interactions with smart contracts. These features make Cardano a flexible and scalable option in the cryptocurrency market. Conclusion With the bull run underway, investors are shifting focus from coins like TRX and ADA, which may offer less short-term potential, to new opportunities. Catzilla emerges as a promising meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom to everyone. Offering a remarkable 700% ROI potential during its presale and triple utility features, it invites enthusiasts to acquire CATZILLA tokens and join the battle against crypto villains.
