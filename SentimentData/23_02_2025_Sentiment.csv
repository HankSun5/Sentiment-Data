40700758,https://coingape.com/?post_type=markets&p=240475,1740259728,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,PEPE Price Rebounds 6% as Analyst Predicts Ethereum Gains from Bybit Losses,https://coingape.com/markets/pepe-price-rebounds-6-as-analyst-predicts-ethereum-gains-from-bybit-losses/,"PEPE price surged 6%, defying market turmoil after Bybit’s $1.4 billion hack—could this be the start of a major rebound? PEPE rebounds 6% as traders bet on Ethereum gains from Bybit Hack PEPE suffered considerable losses on Friday, mirroring the $75 billion crypto market capitulation in the aftermath of the Bybit hack . The Bybit exploit, linked to the notorious Lazarus Group , saw the exchange lose over 400,000 ETH—worth approximately $1.4 billion at the time of the breach. Given that the stolen funds were in ETH, Ethereum-hosted assets like PEPE bore the brunt of the sell-off. PEPE’s price plummeted by 10% on Friday, while rival meme coins such as Dogecoin and Solana’s Dogwifhat (WIF) contained their losses below 5% in the immediate hours following the hack. PEPE Price Action, Feb 22, 2025 | Source: TradingView However, the broader crypto industry quickly rallied to provide support. Binance transferred over 50,000 ETH to Bybit, helping to stabilize liquidity for traders seeking withdrawals. Additionally, Bybit’s CEO reassured users about the safety of their funds. These interventions appear to have averted a systemic market collapse reminiscent of previous exchange mishaps, such as the FTX crash, which saw global crypto market capitalization shrink by nearly 50% within 10 days. However, 24 hours of the Bybit hack, PEPE price showed early signs of recovery, climbing 6% to reclaim the $0.00009 level at press time. Bulls bet $9M on PEPE rally as analysts hint at Ethereum buy-back to offset Bybit losses At press time, the Bybit exploit remains unresolved, with the stolen funds still sitting in a series of cold wallets identified by Arkham Intelligence. While Bybit’s security team collaborates with law enforcement agencies, speculation has emerged over how the exchange might recover the stolen assets. Some market analysts suggest that Bybit may be forced to repurchase the equivalent of the stolen ETH to reimburse customers and balance its books. Prominent analyst Ash Crypto echoed this view while alerting his 1.6 million followers on X (formerly Twitter) about the hack on Friday: “BYBIT hacker can’t sell $1.45 billion ETH for USDC or USDT because it will get frozen by Circle or Tether. So he just took $1.46 billion selling pressure from ETH. For BYBIT to cover customer ETH, they will have to buy $1.46 billion worth of ETH from (the) market.” — Ash Crypto, (Analyst) Feb. 21, 2025 With approximately 120 million ETH in circulation, the 400,000 ETH stolen from Bybit represents about 3% of total supply. If Bybit moves to repurchase the stolen ETH from the open market, it could significantly constrain available liquidity, potentially triggering a sharp price surge for Ethereum and other ecosystem tokens. Meanwhile, PEPE’s 6% price recovery appears to be bolstered by aggressive positioning in the derivatives market. Data from Coinglass, a leading on-chain analytics platform, suggests that strategic traders are already speculating on a continued rebound. PEPE Liquidation Map, Feb 22, 2025 | Coinglass Coinglass ’ liquidation heatmaps track the total capital deployed in leveraged long and short positions for specific assets, providing real-time insights into shifts in market sentiment. As the broader market stabilized, PEPE traders aggressively built up long positions. The latest data indicates that PEPE long positions have reached $9 million, significantly outpacing short positions at just $2.9 million—a disparity of nearly 70%. This substantial leverage gap implies that, as the market recovery unfolds, short traders may be reluctant to cover their positions, further fueling upside momentum. While PEPE remains below the $0.000010 threshold and has yet to fully erase its 10% losses from the Friday crash, the growing long interest suggests sustained bullish momentum in the days ahead. If Ethereum’s price action strengthens due to anticipated buy-backs, PEPE’s recovery phase could gain additional traction, positioning it for further upside. PEPE Price Forecast: Close Above $0.000011 Could Kickstart Recovery Phase PEPE price forecast suggests an emerging recovery phase as the Ethereum-hosted memecoin rebounds 6% following Friday’s sharp drop triggered by the Bybit hack. The chart shows a notable shift in momentum, with PEPE rising above the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) at $0.00000948, indicating that recent buyers have been willing to pay slightly higher prices to secure their positions. This suggests competitive demand, with traders positioning ahead of a potential full recovery to pre-Bybit crash levels. PEPE Price Forecast The daily candlestick structure presents a mixed outlook. The lower Bollinger Band has provided dynamic support, preventing deeper declines, while PEPE’s latest green candle signals an early attempt at a trend reversal. However, a confirmed breakout above the upper Donchian Channel resistance at $0.00001144 is crucial to sustain a bullish continuation. A close above this level could accelerate momentum, driving prices toward the $0.00001200 resistance. On the downside, failure to hold above VWAP could invite another wave of selling, potentially retesting Friday’s lows near $0.00000796. The volume delta remains negative overall, suggesting sellers are still present, but the uptick in green bars during the daily time frame signals a bump in PEPE spot market liquidity as buying interest gradually returns. If bulls maintain dominance in the derivatives markets, PEPE could regain lost ground, solidifying its recovery phase.

Kanye West announced that he will launch his own token next week. However, in his previous statements, he said that all tokens were for the purpose of scamming his followers and declared that he would never release a token. On the other hand, there may be an unusual partnership in the memecoin that West will launch. West retweeted Binance founder Changpeng Zhao’s tweet that “decentralized exchanges are very hard to use.” In addition, it is noteworthy that the only person West, who has 33 million followers, follows on Twitter is Changpeng Zhao.

VanEck Research Weighs In,https://thecoinrise.com/can-bitcoin-pay-off-u-s-debt-vaneck-research-weighs-in/,"The idea of using Bitcoin to reduce the U.S. national debt has been making headlines, especially in President Donald Trump’s speech at the Nashville Bitcoin Conference in July 2024. Following his remarks, the US. Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced a bill proposing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. She said the bill was proposed to help cut down the country’s massive debt. As reported by Crypto.News, a new report from VanEck, an investment management firm, sheds light on whether this plan is feasible. What VanEck’s Research Says According to VanEck’s latest findings, the U.S. government would need to buy one million bitcoins over the next five years and hold them for 20 years. If this plan goes ahead, by 2049, the total value of these bitcoins could reach around $21 trillion. However, this would only cover approximately 18% of the national debt, which is expected to hit $116 trillion by then. It was stated in the report that to achieve these figures, Bitcoin’s price would need to grow at an average rate of 25% per year, eventually reaching $21 billion per coin. Meanwhile, the national debt is projected to rise by 5% annually. While Bitcoin has seen much growth in the past, there is no guarantee it will maintain this pace for the next two decades. In addition, the report mentioned that the acquisition of one million bitcoins would bring about many challenges. This is because the total supply of Bitcoin is currently capped at 21 million. So, any attempts at large government purchases could drive up prices. This will make acquisitions more expensive. Could Bitcoin Ever Erase U.S. Debt? Despite rumors that Bitcoin could wipe out U.S. debt, VanEck’s research suggests otherwise. Paying off the entire debt would require over five million bitcoins at today’s projected growth rates. However, since only 21 million bitcoins exist, this is simply impossible. Furthermore, even if Bitcoin reached $1 million per coin, the U.S. government would still need 36 million bitcoins to clear its debt. On top of that, selling such a massive amount would likely crash the market, further diminishing the value of the reserves. Bitcoin as a Partial Solution While Bitcoin could contribute to debt reduction, it is far from a complete solution. As Senator Lummis initially stated, the aim is to reduce debt, not eliminate it. VanEck’s research supports this perspective, showing that while a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve might help, it is not a magic fix. Since Senator Lummis introduced the bill, several state lawmakers across the U.S. have been considering similar proposals for Bitcoin reserves. For instance, Utah’s Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Bill recently passed the House with an 8-1 vote and is now under review by the Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee. Also, other states, including Florida, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Oklahoma, have also moved to establish Bitcoin reserves. The post Can Bitcoin Pay Off U.S. Debt?

In Berkshire Hathaway’s annual letter to shareholders, Buffett warns the stability and purchasing power of the US dollar can be easily eroded. “Paper money can see its value evaporate if fiscal folly prevails. In some countries, this reckless practice has become habitual, and, in our country’s short history, the U.S. has come close to the edge. Fixed-coupon bonds provide no protection against runaway currency.” Buffett says capitalism itself is suffering from historic levels of abuse within the system, although its power to promote prosperity remains unmatched. “One way or another, the sensible – better yet imaginative – deployment of savings by citizens is required to propel an ever-growing societal output of desired goods and services. This system is called capitalism. It has its faults and abuses – in certain respects more egregious now than ever – but it also can work wonders unmatched by other economic systems… The American process has not always been pretty – our country has forever had many scoundrels and promoters who seek to take advantage of those who mistakenly trust them with their savings. But even with such malfeasance – which remains in full force today – and also much deployment of capital that eventually floundered because of brutal competition or disruptive innovation, the savings of Americans has delivered a quantity and quality of output beyond the dreams of any colonist.” The 94 year-old Berkshire Hathaway CEO says it won’t be long before he ends his historic 60-year tenure at the firm. “At 94, it won’t be long before Greg Abel replaces me as CEO and will be writing the annual letters… We are impartial in our choice of equity vehicles, investing in either variety based upon where we can best deploy your (and my family’s) savings. Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities.

Analys Weigh In,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/could-this-0-00020-token-eclipse-solana-and-ripples-early-success-analys-weigh-in/,"As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve in 2025, THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN has emerged as a potential game-changer, currently priced at $0.20. This Trump-inspired memecoin has captured significant attention, raising over $3 million in its presale phase. To understand its potential, let’s compare it to the early success stories of Solana and Ripple, two established players in the crypto space. Historical Growth Analysis: Solana (SOL) Solana has been a solid performer in the crypto landscape, known for its high-speed transactions and low fees. Its dual-layer consensus system, combining Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of History (PoH), allows for high throughput and low latency. This technological edge has made Solana a preferred platform for DeFi, NFT marketplaces, and gaming applications. Solana’s growth has been impressive, with its price reaching $219.47 and a 24-hour trading volume of $3.25 billion. The network’s ability to handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) under optimal conditions has positioned it as a strong competitor in the high-throughput blockchain space. Historical Growth Analysis: Ripple (XRP) Ripple has focused on revolutionizing cross-border payments, partnering with over 300 financial institutions globally. Its XRP Ledger processes 1,500 TPS, with transactions settling in 3-5 seconds at a cost of around $0.0002 per transaction. Despite facing regulatory challenges, including an ongoing legal battle with the SEC, Ripple has maintained its position as a leader in the payments sector. The outcome of its legal issues could significantly impact its adoption within institutional finance. THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN: The Trending Memecoin Set To Explode ACT FAST! USE PROMO CODE MAGA50X NOW AND CLAIM YOUR 50% EXTRA BONUS! THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN has shown remarkable potential, with its presale raising $3,076,115.19. Currently priced at $0.0001978 per token, it’s set to list at $0.007, indicating substantial growth potential. Key factors driving THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN’s potential include: A limited supply of 100 billion tokens, creating scarcity Strong community backing with over 60,000 supporters Unique blend of political branding and crypto innovation Analysts predict that THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN could reach $1 in 2025, potentially delivering significant returns for early investors. Comparative Market Potential While Solana and Ripple have established themselves in specific niches – Solana in high-performance blockchain applications and Ripple in cross-border payments – THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN is positioning itself as a community-driven, politically charged token with broad appeal. The current market environment, characterized by increasing regulatory clarity and institutional adoption, could benefit all three tokens. However, MAGACOIN’s unique positioning and viral potential could lead to explosive growth similar to or surpassing the early days of Solana and Ripple. Don’t Miss the Rise of THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN – Invest at $0.00020 Today! THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN presents a unique opportunity in the evolving crypto landscape of 2025. With its strong community support, limited supply, and potential for viral growth, it could eclipse the early success of both Solana and Ripple. The token’s current price of $0.20 offers an attractive entry point for investors seeking high-growth potential.

SHIB’s technical indicators have analysts debating a potential rally, while LTC is navigating a key price point. BlockDAG, having raised over $197 million and sold 18.5 billion coins in its presale, is making waves in the Web3 space, attracting a massive influx of developer talent through its HackerEarth partnership. This article explores these exciting developments, providing insights into the Shiba Inu breakout forecast, Litecoin’s potential, and BlockDAG’s ambitious vision for the future of decentralized technology. Shiba Inu Breakout Forecast: A 23% Surge on the Horizon? The Shiba Inu breakout forecast is a major topic among traders following the coin’s earlier price climb. A subsequent dip has raised questions about the forecast’s validity. However, some technical observers highlight a golden cross formation on the daily chart, a potentially bullish signal. The Shiba Inu breakout forecast also considers a key Fibonacci retracement level where the coin found support. A prior golden cross event led to a substantial price increase, prompting speculation about a possible 23% rally. The Shiba Inu breakout forecast is being closely watched by many in the crypto community. Litecoin Price Trends: Targeting $140 and Beyond? The Litecoin (LTC) price prediction is attracting attention as the coin holds above $126, a level some view as a springboard for further gains. Some analysts suggest that breaking through this resistance could propel LTC toward $140 or higher, particularly given improving market sentiment related to regulatory clarity. Expert LTC price predictions point to potential higher targets if trading volume remains robust. However, mixed indicators have led to some caution among traders. A symmetrical triangle pattern on daily charts adds to the uncertainty. Upcoming ETF news could also impact Litecoin’s outlook, with the possibility of reaching $200 if conditions are favorable. BlockDAG x HackerEarth: Building the Next Generation of Web3 BlockDAG’s partnership with HackerEarth is creating significant excitement. By hosting global hackathons, BlockDAG is engaging over 10,000 developers. This initiative highlights BlockDAG’s commitment to building a vibrant Web3 ecosystem. With over $197 million raised and 18.5 billion coins sold, BlockDAG’s presale is demonstrating incredible momentum. Early participants have seen substantial returns, and there is talk of even greater returns in the future. These hackathons are not just for show. BlockDAG aims to be the leading developer-friendly Layer 1 platform, facilitating the creation of over 200 new Web3 projects across various sectors. This focus on developer engagement is expected to drive innovation, resulting in dApps tailored to specific markets and industries. BlockDAG’s leadership emphasizes the crucial role of the HackerEarth partnership in attracting top-tier talent. Localized events ensure that developers from all regions have the chance to contribute to the Web3 revolution. BlockDAG’s presale success reflects the project’s growing community and potential for mainstream adoption. With its focus on scalability, developer experience, and real-world applications, BlockDAG is positioning itself as a key player in the blockchain arena. A Quick Recap Traders are carefully observing market trends, including the Shiba Inu breakout forecast. The coin’s earlier price surge has sparked discussions about the potential for another upward move. Litecoin’s price prediction is also in focus as the coin consolidates above a key level, with analysts speculating about a push toward higher targets. BlockDAG’s collaboration with HackerEarth is expected to accelerate Web3 development.

Franklin Templeton’s Franklin Crypto Index ETF (EZPZ) has attracted around $2.5 million in net assets since launching on Feb. 20, while Hashdex’s Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF (NCIQ) has gathered just over $1 million since its Feb. 14 debut. By comparison, Franklin Templeton’s spot Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) saw significantly higher interest, pulling in approximately $50 million on its first day in January 2024, with Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) reaching nearly $240 million on its debut. Diversification Limits and Regulatory Barriers The two ETFs aim to provide investors with exposure to a diverse crypto index. However, due to regulatory restrictions, they currently hold only Bitcoin and Ether, which dominate their portfolios. The hope is to expand to other cryptocurrencies pending regulatory approval.

According to data provided by Binance and analyzed by CryptoQuant, the number of Binance Pay users tripled from the previous year, reaching 41.7 million. This rapid adoption highlights the increasing role of crypto in everyday transactions. Stablecoins Lead the Charge The total transaction volume processed through Binance Pay in 2024 stood at $72.4 billion, the report found. This is a notable rise from $2.5 billion in 2021. Stablecoins, particularly Tether (USDT), dominated Binance Pay transactions as it accounted for 80% of the total payment volume, which equated to $57 billion. Top crypto assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Binance Coin (BNB) followed suit, contributing $6.6 billion, $2.4 billion, and $2.2 billion, respectively, and represented 9%, 3%, and 3% of the total transaction value. Another popular stablecoin, USD Coin (USDC), exhibited notable year-over-year growth, with a 1,338% increase in transaction count and a 48% rise in transaction volume. Broader market trends indicate a rise in high-frequency token transactions on Binance Pay, with Solana (SOL) leading the surge. In fact, CryptoQuant found that SOL payments reached $724 million in 2024 and represented a 656% year-over-year increase. During the same period, Bitcoin transactions rose by 73% to $6.6 billion, while Ethereum payments grew by 69% to $2.4 billion. USDC and BNB also recorded notable growth, increasing by 48% and 29%, respectively. Binance Pay’ s expansion aligns with the overall growth of the crypto market and Binance’s increasing role in facilitating transactions. This trend is further validated by a significant rise in Binance’s cryptocurrency reserves. The USD value of its Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, and USDC reserves exceeded $100 billion in 2024, marking a 137% increase from the start of the year when reserves stood at $43 billion. The increasing use of Binance Pay reflects a larger global trend as cryptocurrency ownership continues to rise. Crypto Adoption Global cryptocurrency ownership witnessed a 13% increase in 2024, rising from 583 million in January to 659 million in December, according to a report by Crypto.com. Bitcoin ownership grew by 13.1%, reaching 337 million users and accounting for over 51% of all crypto owners. Ethereum saw a 13.6% increase, with owners rising from 125 million to 142 million, and represented 21.7% of global ownership. Additionally, between 300,000 and 1.2 million people may have invested in BTC through US spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Institutional interest and pro-crypto policies from US President-elect Donald Trump were major factors driving BTC adoption. The report observed that ETH’s growth was fueled by Ethereum Layer 2 network rallies following the Dencun upgrade and the launch of spot Ethereum ETFs, which contributed to increased investor participation.

If this happens, we could see XRP usage skyrocket as more financial institutions jump on board, which might drive up its price significantly – we’ll check it out in detail below. While XRP is bringing changes in traditional finance, PlutoChain could bring new functionalities in the Bitcoin space. Their hybrid L2 technology could give Bitcoin’s ecosystem a serious upgrade in the coming weeks. Let’s check out the details. XRP Price Prediction: Japanese Banks’ XRP Adoption Could Signal Major Price Movement – Is $10 on the Horizon? Japan’s financial sector might be on the verge of a major shift toward XRP adoption. SBI Group’s leader Yoshitaka Kitao envisions XRP revolutionizing how Japan’s migrant workers send money home, making transfers faster and cheaper. Industry insiders suggest a massive wave of adoption is building, with potentially 80% of Japanese banks considering XRP integration. This could dramatically boost both trading activity and market liquidity as banks tap into XRP for international transfers. The ripple effect could spread beyond Japan’s borders – if other Asian financial hubs follow suit, we might see unprecedented demand for XRP. Market analyst Farshad Rouhani has set an ambitious target, suggesting XRP could break $10 in early 2025 as Japanese banks roll out XRP-based payment systems. PlutoChain’s Hybrid Layer-2 Solution Could Transform Bitcoin’s Ecosystem Bitcoin continues to face challenges with its core infrastructure – users often encounter lengthy transaction times, high fees, and network bottlenecks that could limit its mainstream adoption. These scaling issues might become even more pressing as usage grows. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could offer a solution through its hybrid Layer-2 architecture that potentially works in parallel with Bitcoin’s main chain. By redirecting transaction traffic to its network, PlutoChain might significantly reduce fees and ease congestion, while potentially solving Bitcoin’s long-standing scalability challenges. The speed difference could be transformative. While Bitcoin typically requires 10 minutes to process blocks, trailing behind networks like Ethereum and Solana, PlutoChain’s Layer-2 solution might achieve block times of approximately 2 seconds. This improvement could enable faster smart contract execution while maintaining the robust security guarantees of Bitcoin’s network. A key feature of PlutoChain is its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. This feature could create a bridge between Bitcoin and the vast ecosystem of Ethereum-based applications. Projects focused on decentralized finance, NFT marketplaces, and emerging AI applications might soon flourish within Bitcoin’s ecosystem, potentially breathing new life into the network. Early performance indicators appear promising – testnet results show PlutoChain could process up to 43,200 transactions per day without experiencing slowdowns, suggesting robust scalability potential. Security is important in PlutoChain’s development approach. The project has undergone comprehensive audits from respected firms including SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi . Regular stress testing could help ensure the network maintains reliability even under heavy load conditions. Community governance stands as another cornerstone of the project. Through its decentralized governance model, PlutoChain could empower users to actively participate in the network’s evolution. Community members might propose changes and vote on crucial protocol decisions, potentially creating a more democratic and user-driven development process. The Bottom Line XRP’s momentum in Japanese banking could drive major price movements, while PlutoChain could gain traction as a potential upgrade in the Bitcoin ecosystem. By tackling Bitcoin’s core challenges with its hybrid Layer-2 solution, this project might revolutionize how we use the world’s largest digital asset – potentially offering faster transactions and lower fees while maintaining Bitcoin’s legendary security. ——- The information in this article does not represent financial or investment advice.

Their discussion about a potential national XRP reserve has ignited speculation – could this be the catalyst to propel XRP to $30? Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could be interesting to watch because of its innovative hybrid Layer-2 solution for Bitcoin. Designed to tackle Bitcoin’s long-standing issues like sluggish transaction speeds and limited scalability, this project could redefine Bitcoin as we know it. Let’s check out the details. XRP Is Showing Great Potential For a $30 Rally – What Are Analysts Saying? XRP is making noise in the crypto community with whispers of a potential $30 price surge, fueled by reported discussions between Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and President Donald Trump. It’s currently trading at $2.73 showing great potential for a breakout, and this high-profile chatter could be the match to light the fuse. XRP 7-day chart, Source: Binance Technically, XRP’s flexing strength, sitting below the 200-day EMA – a bullish bedrock. Resistance at $2.65 and $3.00 is in its crosshairs, and the RSI at 36 approaching oversold territory, a potential short-term bounce. The volume’s simmered to $4.2 billion daily from January’s $10 billion peak, but a Trump-Ripple bombshell could unleash a torrent of buying. A bullish pennant on the daily chart screams breakout potential – $3.66 could fall fast, paving the way to double digits. Historically, XRP thrives on regulatory clarity; a friendly nod from Trump could mirror 2017’s epic rally . Analysts are all-in on this bullish wave. DeepSeek AI model predicts that XRP could skyrocket to $30 in 2025, driven by increased institutional adoption and potential market share in global foreign exchange. On the other hand, CoinCodex experts indicate that XRP could reach as high as $4.24 by April 2025, based on historical data and market trends – significantly lower than the previous prediction but still promising. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Could Transform Bitcoin Into a Hub For Development and Innovation – New Layer-2 Blockchain Offers Smart Contracts and EVM Compatibility PlutoChain ($PLUTO) emerges as a hybrid Layer-2 blockchain with the potential to redefine Bitcoin’s role in the crypto ecosystem. Unlike Bitcoin’s base layer, which excels in security but lags in speed, this project could deliver an impressive upgrade. It offers a block time of 2 seconds compared to Bitcoin’s standard 10 minutes and scales to handle over 43,200 transactions per day, per testnet results. This leap in performance could position Bitcoin as a dynamic platform, not just a passive asset, appealing to enthusiasts eager for broader utility. Developers stand at the forefront of this shift. PlutoChain equips Bitcoin with smart contracts, unlocking the ability to build sophisticated decentralized applications directly on its network. Its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility adds another layer of appeal, enabling developers to seamlessly adapt Ethereum projects for Bitcoin’s infrastructure. This cross-chain potential could streamline workflows and inspire novel solutions, while users benefit from swift, low-fee transactions and access to innovative tools, all underpinned by Bitcoin’s reliability. For the DeFi community, PlutoChain offers a fresh angle. Bitcoin’s DeFi footprint remains minimal next to Ethereum’s and Solana’s. By weaving DeFi capabilities into Bitcoin, such as lending protocols and liquidity pools, PlutoChain could elevate and potentially challenge Ethereum or Solana’s established networks. Security holds firm as a cornerstone. PlutoChain has cleared audits from respected names like SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi , validating its technical integrity. Beyond that, its decentralized governance structure invites community members to shape the project’s future through Discord -based voting, ensuring decisions reflect community priorities and maintain accountability. PlutoChain’s vision taps into Bitcoin’s untapped potential, blending speed, scalability, and programmability. It hands developers a powerful canvas to innovate and users a more versatile network to explore. Conclusion XRP’s potential surge to $30 is gaining traction following discussions between Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Donald Trump, with speculation around a national XRP reserve adding fuel to the rally. Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could expand Bitcoin’s capabilities with its hybrid Layer-2 solution, enabling smart contracts, faster transactions, and DeFi integration. By merging Bitcoin’s security with Ethereum-like functionality, it could lead the way in the blockchain industry. ——- Please keep in mind that this article is not financial advice.

40702703,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=680672,1740262834,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40702703.jpeg,mETH Protocol and Tether lead campaign to freeze Bybit hacker’s bounty,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/meth-protocol-tether-freeze-bybit-hackers/,"The cryptocurrency space was ripe for a black swan event, and one promptly presented itself with the $1.4 billion Bybit hack. However, unlike previous debacles that led to near-total collapses, the industry has managed this episode fairly well—further highlighting the maturity of the digital asset space. In what many are calling the biggest crypto hack of all time, Bybit lost more than $1.4 billion in ETH and stETH early Friday. An investigation is ongoing, however, according to prominent on-chain sleuth ZachXBT, it is highly likely North Korea’s Lazarus group was behind the hack thanks to patterns consistent with their MO. After news of the hack spread, there was initial panic in the markets as Bybit users rushed to get their funds off the CEX, reminded all too well of how FTX folded following a series of panic withdrawals. Fortunately, it did not take long for order to be restored, and the crypto community has shown its resilience and togetherness after the early sensationalism that followed the big headline. mETH protocol joins Binance, others in supporting Bybit Shortly after news got out about the hack, mETH Protocol, a decentralized, permissionless platform built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to stake their ETH and receive liquid staking tokens, known as mETH, released a post-mortem of the hack. The report revealed that the attacker executed multiple transactions to move assets off the platform. According to mETH’s report, 8,000 mETH were swapped for ETH across three transactions via a DEX, and a 15,000 cmETH withdrawal was initiated via mETH Protocol. However, it did not allow the hackers to complete the transaction. The hackers would have gotten away with the funds if not for the protocol’s security measures, which include an 8-hour withdrawal delay built into the protocol to prevent the immediate withdrawal of cmETH. The protocol also blacklisted the exploiter’s address, reducing the cmETH liquidity on Mantle Network and the recovery of about 15,000 cmETH from the exploiter’s address to a recovery address, reinstating the integrity of cmETH supply. Aside from the mETH Protocol, other notable groups in crypto that have stepped up to help include Binance and Tether. On Friday, Paolo Ardoino, the CEO of Tether, revealed his firm had frozen $181,000 worth of the UDST linked to the stolen Bybit funds, thanks to the help of ZachXBT. “Might not be much but it’s honest work,” Ardoino wrote on X. “We keep monitoring.” On Binance’s part, it chose to provide a bridge loan to Bybit so that it can continue to process client withdrawals without delay, ensuring that users can access their funds despite the hack. Bitget has also provided a 64,452 ETH loan to Bybit, and MEXC transferred 12,652 stETH to Bybit’s cold wallet as a sign of solidarity. By now, it is clear that Bybit has weathered the storm from the attack. Following the breach, the firm confirmed that withdrawals were still active but warned that some users might experience delays due to network congestion. Despite the warning, Bybit was able to process 70% of the withdrawal requests successfully, and efforts are underway to address the remaining backlog. Now that the worst has passed, the company is focusing on recovery. On Saturday, Bybit stated it would offer 10% of recovered funds—up to $140 million—to any on-chain security experts who could help the firm get the stolen assets back. In a statement, Bybit co-founder and CEO Ben Zhou highlighted the show of solidarity from the space and promised it was not taken for granted. “We have shared in a dark moment of crypto history, and we’ve proven we are better than the malicious actors,” Zhou said. “We want to officially reward our community who lent us their expertise, experience, and support through the Recovery Bounty Program, and our efforts to make this difficult lesson a valuable one does not stop here.” Ben also noted that the hackers are moving some of the funds to Chainflip.io as a bridge to convert into BTC. He shared an SOS to any bridges with the capacity to freeze or even recover the funds stolen from his exchange, saying “If you are a bridge, Please help us to block and prevent further conversion to other chains.” Projects that have the potential to join the asset-freezing effort According to reports, most of the stolen funds are in native Ethereum, which is not easy to recover since it lacks a centralized freezing mechanism. About 8,000–15,000 mETH and approximately 181,000 USDT were also stolen. While Bybit pursues justice, onlookers have urged more entities currently sitting on the sidelines to join the effort by freezing the assets of the hackers. Some other projects people are expecting to take action include Lido (stETH) and Ethereum (ETH). Lido is a major liquid staking protocol and the issuer of stETH (Staked ETH). It could help by blacklisting stETH addresses, but this might only happen if it is pressured by Bybit or regulators. Also, its decentralized nature makes swift action less likely unless the effort is spearheaded by exchanges or law enforcement. While native ETH cannot be frozen by a single entity because of the chain’s decentralization, a hard fork or rollback could in theory invalidate the stolen funds. This was done once in 2016 when there was a DAO hack. It would require consensus from miners, nodes, and the community. While thought leaders like Arthur Hayes have been talking about the possibility of an Ethereum rollback, given the hack’s scale, there has been no official announcement, and the community’s willingness to do such a thing is uncertain. If there is no overwhelming support from the community, a rollback is unlikely to happen, and blacklisting at the protocol level isn’t feasible, although exchanges could tag and block exploiter addresses. Should the hackers also make the mistake of swapping the stolen ETH into other ERC-20 tokens like USDC, those projects have the ability to freeze funds as long as their contracts permit it. Circle (USDC) has been known to freeze stolen funds in the past, however in those cases, significant USDC had been lost. That is not the case this time. Some analysts are convinced the hackers will eventually convert the ETH to ERC-20 tokens before moving it to BTC and finally fiat via Asian exchanges.

Although it has a current price of $176 , according to CoinGecko, experts say this rise might happen as a result of USD/GBP exchange rates shift. Investors are watching closely because these currency changes can influence SOL’s growth. Meanwhile, Panshibi , a new meme coin, shines as a top crypto pick. Its presale, with only 30 days left, has already raised over $1,000,000. This article explores how USD/GBP fluctuations will push SOL’s price and why Panshibi is gaining attention in the cryptocurrency world today. USD/GBP Swings Push SOL Toward $375 Milestone Based on data from CoinMarketcap , Solana (SOL) trades at approximately $176 on February 21, 2025. Now, experts predict it could reach $375 soon due to the influence of swings in the USD/GBP exchange rate. The rate compares the US dollar to the British pound and its changes affect cryptocurrency prices globally. When the USD strengthens against the GBP, crypto often becomes more appealing to investors using pounds, boosting demand for coins like SOL. SOL’s price has been steady, hovering between $170 and $200 over the past week, with a market cap of about $85.57 billion . Its blockchain is known for fast transactions up to 65,000 per second and low fees of $0.0025 per transaction on an average, according to Solana’s official site. These strengths make it a top crypto pick among developers and investors, supporting its growth. Also, some analysts have noted SOL’s potential to double in value soon, driven by these currency dynamics and its solid technology. Unlike some coins, SOL’s rise is backed by real use in decentralized apps and finance. However, the market remains unpredictable. If the USD/GBP stabilizes, SOL’s climb might slow. Still, with its current trajectory and global economic factors at play, reaching $375 seems within reach. Investors are keeping a close eye on exchange rates, knowing they could push SOL, a top crypto pick even higher in the coming weeks. Panshibi’s Final 30 Days: A Rising Star in Crypto Panshibi, a new meme coin, is in the spotlight as a top crypto pick with just 30 days left in its presale as of February 22, 2025. It has raised over $1,000,000 at stage 4 of the presale with a token price of $0.005. This success shows strong interest from investors. Unlike many meme coins, Panshibi blends fun with real utility, offering AI features and Social-Fi rewards. The coin’s appeal comes from its community focus and unique design. Panshibi is set to offer a 1200% increase during its presale and a 145,000% increase after its launch. This has attracted investors who want profit and stability. It also plans to list on major exchanges, boosting its visibility. With 720 million tokens in the presale already and a total supply of 1.2 billion, Panshibi allows investors to become early adopters. Since meme coins often rely on hype, Panshibi’s mix of innovation, tech and community sets it apart. Now, the final 30 days are critical. Early buyers could see big returns if it follows the path of coins like Shiba Inu, which soared after launch. With strong backing and a clear plan, Panshibi is set to be the top crypto pick for 2025. Conclusion Solana’s push toward $375 reflects how USD/GBP swings shape the crypto market. On other news, Panshibi emerges as a top crypto pick with its presale nearing its end with less than 30 days left. After the launch, Panshibi will list on Uniswap and multiple CEXs. Don’t miss out on this lifetime opportunity, join Panshibi’s presale now and be part of its innovation before it’s too late.

With a growing community, strategic tokenomics, and expanding utility, Pepeto stands out in a crowded market. Dogecoin Set the Standard #Dogecoin started as a joke but became a pioneer in the meme coin sector. Dogecoin attained widespread mainstream popularity because it developed both a powerful community structure and high levels of virality. Over time, Dogecoin gained utility through tipping, payments, and integrations with major businesses. The coin’s duration demonstrates that meme coins can endure longer than momentary speculation. Influential figures, including Elon Musk, contributed to Dogecoin growth. Despite its initial playful nature, Dogecoin remains a key player in the crypto space. Pepe Followed with a Fresh Approach The new investor base came to market through #Pepe because it incorporated contemporary meme-based design elements. Young investors received exposure to Pepe through their engagement with online communities and viral marketing. Users interested in Pepe pursued its deflationary framework because it presented investment benefits that were dissimilar to those of Dogecoin. These developments demonstrated how internet culture defines the future of meme coins as an investment opportunity. The market saw potential in Pepe, which led investors to value it significantly high. Pepe’s success confirmed that meme cryptocurrency investments survive through distinctive branding and restricted token availability mechanisms. Pepeto Leads with Innovation and Utility #Pepeto takes meme coins further by combining strong branding with real-world use cases.

DOGE meme coin eyes breakout as SEC reviews spot ETF filing Dogecoin (DOGE) is approaching a critical juncture, with technical indicators pointing to a potential 25% breakout. A symmetrical triangle pattern on the 1-hour chart suggests Dogecoin’s price is consolidating, preparing for a significant move. Analysts are closely watching whether Dogecoin surges higher or faces another downturn. According to Crypto Analyst Ali Martinez, the symmetrical triangle signals an impending breakout as Dogecoin’s price squeezes between trendlines. Meanwhile, the SEC has acknowledged Grayscale’s filing for a spot Dogecoin ETF, marking the beginning of its review process. If approved, the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust could bring Dogecoin to mainstream investment markets. The DOGE meme coin trades at $0.26, and analysts expect a rally to $1. Dogecoin is still a top crypto contender with growing institutional interest and technical momentum building. Dogwifhat (WIF) struggles below $1 after 87% drop Dogwifhat (WIF) was among the best cryptos to perform during the last market cycle, advancing 3,000% to an all-time high in March 2024. Dogwifhat was the largest meme coin in the Solana ecosystem and rapidly grew well-known, but it is now not among the top 100 cryptocurrencies. The downturn began in November 2024 and extended into 2025, with Dogwifhat plummeting 87% from its peak. On Feb. 3, 2025, Dogwifhat hit a low of $0.55 and struggled to recover. Currently, Dogwifhat trades at $0.60, sitting below the crucial $1 threshold needed to trigger bullish momentum. Despite its decline, Dogwifhat remains a key player in Solana’s meme coin sector. Analysts suggest that a break back above $1 could reignite investor interest, but until then, Dogwifhat faces an uncertain path in the volatile crypto market. 1Fuel (OFT): Cross-chain trading, AI tools, and exclusive bonuses 1Fuel (OFT) is transforming decentralized trading with its cross-chain compatibility, allowing seamless transactions across multiple blockchains.

However, this bullish dream ended almost immediately after it started as nearly $1.5 billion worth of ETH tokens were drained from the ByBit exchange. Ethereum, which traded as high as $2,840 earlier on Friday, February 21, dropped towards $2,600 on the back of news of the ByBit hack. Interestingly, recent on-chain data suggests that the altcoin’s price could still make its way to $4,000 before the end of this cycle. Could ETH Price Still Record A 60% Rally This Cycle? In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, an analyst with the pseudonym Crypto Sunmoon identified a particular bullish divergence that offers insight into the Ethereum price performance in the near future. This bullish observation is based on recent movements of ETH’s “taker buy/sell ratio” across all exchanges. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price On The Edge: Breakout Or Breakdown—What’s Next? This metric measures the taker buy and taker sell volumes for a specific cryptocurrency (Ethereum, in this case). When the taker buy/sell ratio is greater than one, it implies that the taker buy volume is higher than the taker sell volume. This is typically considered a bullish signal, indicating the willingness of investors to pay a higher price for an asset. On the contrary, a less-than-one taker buy/sell ratio indicates that sellers are overwhelming the buyers in the market. This scenario suggests that more sellers are willing to offload their assets at a lower price, signaling a bearish shift in investor sentiment. Crypto Sunmoon noted that the 100-day exponential moving average (EMA) of the Ethereum taker buy/sell ratio on all exchanges has been rising in recent weeks. The Ethereum price, on the other hand, has been declining since mid-December. According to the analyst, this divergence is positive, as it indicates that a bearish trend has ended and an upward trend could be starting. The last time this bullish divergence occurred, the Ethereum price traveled from beneath $2,500 to above $4,000 (over 60% rally). While investors would view a reclaim of $3,000 as a victory for Ethereum, history and this bullish divergence suggest that the altcoin’s price could still climb toward the $4,000 mark before the end of the current cycle. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Ethereum stands around $2,650, reflecting a nearly 4% decline in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: More Pain Ahead For Solana?

In what he categorized as the ELI5 explainer to non-technical community members, Beiko explained why a rollback is impossible. Historical Trend Behind Chain Rollback The conversations around potential Ethereum rollback followed the $1.4 billion Bybit hack . With over 401,000 ETH siphoned on-chain, top industry leaders are now advocating for a chain halt to reverse the transactions. According to Tim Beiko on X , the rollback trend is not a new trend. He returned to memory lane, noting that they started with Bitcoin in 2010. At the time, a client software minted 184 billion Bitcoins in block 74638. At the time, it was easy for Satoshi Nakamoto to deploy a software patch to address the bug. Also, TheDAO, an Ethereum protocol, suffered a hack in which bad actors siphoned approximately 15% of all ETH it had in custody. Luckily, at the time, there was a fail-safe system where funds withdrawn were frozen for 30 days before access was granted. This allowed the Ethereum developers to rollback the chain, creating a new chain. Tim Beiko noted that the updated chain at the time became Ethereum, while the old chain remained Ethereum Classic. Why is Ethereum Rollback Impossible? In justifying why it is impossible to reverse the transactions on the Ethereum Block that led to the hack, Beiko pointed out the complexity of the current ETH chain. Unlike Bitcoin in 2010, which had limited adoption and a price of $0.07, Ethereum powers real-world economic transactions. The researcher said attempting to roll back the transaction will significantly affect the ecosystem. In addition, he noted that the Lazarus Group behind the hack had moved the Ethereum funds, aligning with earlier reports. Unlike TheDAO, Beiko pointed out the complications in rolling back these transactions. Lastly, he identified the opposition to the rollback of Ethereum in 2018 in a situation related to Parity’s multisig wallet. Despite the over 500,000 Ethereum involved in the case, developers within the ecosystem did not agree to the move. The Ethereum Pectra Upgrade Challenge While Tim Beiko did not highlight this, the protocol is expecting the Pectra upgrade to launch in April. This upgrade, which has been under development for over a year, is set to enter the testing phase in the coming week. Some experts are concerned that the chain rollback plans may also impact the Pectra upgrade. The Ethereum network roadmap is on track; however, industry backlash on the siphoned funds has yet to be resolved.

Ripple (XRP) has long been a key player in cross-border transactions, gaining institutional adoption despite regulatory uncertainties. However, new projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are emerging with strong utility and fresh opportunities, drawing attention from early investors. Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a major force in decentralized finance (DeFi), offering a lending platform where users can supply assets, borrow funds, and earn passive income. Unlike XRP, which is primarily focused on payments, MUTM brings a self-sustaining ecosystem with real financial applications. With over $1 million raised in its presale and Phase 1 nearly sold out, analysts are beginning to view Mutuum Finance as a high-upside opportunity with strong fundamentals backing its long-term growth. Ripple (XRP) XRP has remained a strong contender in the crypto market, largely due to its role in facilitating fast and low-cost cross-border transactions. Its adoption among financial institutions has positioned it as a promising asset, and some analysts believe it could eventually reach $5. However, the timeline for such growth remains uncertain, as XRP’s price movements have been influenced by regulatory challenges and market fluctuations. While its long-term potential is still debated, investors looking for faster returns are exploring alternatives like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which offers a dynamic ecosystem with immediate utility and a structured growth strategy. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly establishing itself as a strong contender in decentralized finance (DeFi), attracting both experienced investors and newcomers seeking high-growth opportunities. Unlike many early-stage projects, Mutuum Finance provides tangible financial utility through its decentralized lending protocol. Users can supply assets to earn passive income or borrow funds while keeping their holdings intact, creating a sustainable economic model that drives continuous demand for the MUTM token. These real-world applications set it apart from speculative tokens and position it for long-term success. The project’s presale has already demonstrated remarkable traction, raising over $1,040,000 in a short time while surpassing 2,200 holders. With more than 97% of Phase 1 tokens sold out, early investors are securing MUTM at $0.01 before the next price increase. Analysts point to this rapid fundraising as a key indicator of growing confidence in the project. As more participants enter the ecosystem and upcoming exchange listings expand accessibility, many believe Mutuum Finance is positioned for exponential growth. Mutuum Finance’s long-term value is further reinforced by its ecosystem utilities, which are designed to create sustained demand and price appreciation. The integration of an overcollateralized stablecoin ensures stability in lending and borrowing, while the buy-and-distribute mechanism continuously supports token demand by using platform revenue to repurchase MUTM from the market. This self-sustaining approach fosters price stability and encourages long-term holding, benefiting both lenders and borrowers. Mutuum Finance’s overcollateralized stablecoin operates on the Ethereum network, maintaining a 1:1 backing with on-chain collateral. This ensures that every minted token is fully secured, allowing users to borrow stable-value assets while keeping their crypto holdings intact. When users lock assets as collateral, they can generate the stablecoin, which is later burned upon loan repayment or liquidation. This process stabilizes supply and demand, offering a transparent and decentralized alternative to traditional stablecoins while improving liquidity within the platform’s lending ecosystem. With a clear roadmap, growing adoption, and strong early-stage momentum, Mutuum Finance is gaining recognition as one of the most promising DeFi projects of 2025. Analysts predict that as adoption increases and the platform scales, MUTM’s value will surge by 4,500%, offering significant upside potential for early investors. Those who recognize its growth potential now have the opportunity to secure a position before the project gains widespread market attention.

XRP – Facilitating Global Financial Transactions XRP continues to be influential in the crypto sphere, especially for its efficiency in handling large-scale, low-cost transactions across borders. Supported by numerous financial institutions, XRP recently gained attention due to speculation about the SEC potentially dropping its lawsuit against Ripple, sparking optimism. As financial infrastructures more fully embrace blockchain, XRP emerges as a top contender among the best crypto coins to buy now, thanks to its practical applications in global finance. Its capability for quick, cost-effective transactions positions it well for expanded use.

Beginning February 17, Jupiter will dedicate 50% of protocol fees to repurchase and lock JUP tokens for three years, bolstering long-term value and stability. With a transparent buyback dashboard, Jupiter is strategically poised for continued growth in the DeFi sector. The current price of JUP is $0.00073409, with the buyback strategy expected to significantly enhance its market value moving forward. Final Words!

XRP remains a top choice for cross-border payments, and Jupiter’s strategic buyback plan positions it as a key player in decentralized exchanges. For investors exploring the best crypto coins to buy now , these assets offer promising avenues for both immediate and long-term growth.

This comes after several recent events suggest a significant change in how the agency handles crypto rules. OpenSea Lawsuit End: New Era for Crypto Oversight? OpenSea has been under investigation since last year when it received a “Wells notice from the SEC. This is a formal warning that the regulatory agency might take legal action. The SEC believed some NFTs on OpenSea could be unregistered securities. This raised questions about how digital collectibles fit into existing laws. Meanwhile, the SEC decided to drop the case against OpenSea shortly after it announced plans to dismiss its lawsuit against Coinbase. These back-to-back decisions suggest the agency is easing its tough approach to crypto, which was what the former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s leadership was known for. Under new leadership, the SEC is changing its strategy. Acting Chairman Mark T. Uyeda has put Commissioner Hester Peirce, a strong supporter of fair crypto rules, in charge of a new unit called the Crypto Task Force. This task force’s role is to work on clearer regulations and communicate directly with crypto companies. OpenSea Victory and the Future of NFT Regulation For OpenSea, the SEC’s decision removes a big legal risk. CEO Devin Finzer criticized the investigation, saying it was unfair to artists and creators. Now that the case is closed, OpenSea can focus on its plans, including the launch of its SEA token airdrop, which will be available to U.S. users. The company hinted at the airdrop after recently introducing its new OS2 platform . Crypto airdrops have always been in a legal gray area. In September, members of Congress asked the SEC to clarify their rules, saying the uncertainty hurts U.S. investors. With the SEC changing its approach, future airdrops and NFT marketplaces may face fewer legal issues. SEC’s Changing Stance on Crypto Cases This is not the first time the SEC has stepped back from a crypto investigation. Last year, it looked into Paxos’ BUSD stablecoin, saying it might be a security, but later dropped the case. The SEC also ended its investigation into Ethereum’s switch to proof-of-stake. Now, with Peirce’s task force working with companies on issues like staking ETFs, the SEC seems more focused on crypto advancements. This marks a shift from its previous strict enforcement approach.

Details,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-ceo-stresses-major-shift-end-of-xrp-case-is-near-details/,"Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently shared his perspective on the SEC’s regulatory stance, suggesting that the agency under its current leadership is moving away from the enforcement-driven policies of the previous administration. Acknowledging the impatience of many within the crypto community, he noted that the SEC appears to be taking a different approach, signaling a potential shift in regulatory strategy. His statement quickly gained traction among XRP supporters and the broader cryptocurrency industry, sparking speculation about the potential resolution of the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit. Many see this as a sign that the prolonged legal battle, which began in December 2020, could be approaching its conclusion. BREAKING: CEO of @Ripple – Brad Garlinghouse says: “This SEC has demonstrated a clear interest in moving on quickly (!) from the failed regulation by enforcement policies of the last Administration.” The End Of The SEC v. RIPPLE Case Is Near! #XRP pic.twitter.com/GrqTukv7OB — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) February 21, 2025 Community Reactions and Speculation The response from the crypto community was immediate. X user JackTheRippler shared Garlinghouse’s statement, emphasizing its significance by framing it as a major development. His post suggested that the SEC is moving from its previous regulatory approach, fueling optimism among XRP enthusiasts. Not everyone was convinced. Kailas Worlds expressed skepticism, questioning why there had been no official dismissal of the lawsuit. He called for “less talk, more action,” reflecting the impatience of many XRP supporters waiting for a resolution for years. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 On the other hand, TraderJoe struck a more optimistic tone. He pointed out that the U.S. crypto market is expanding rapidly and suggested that this regulatory shift could pave the way for greater institutional adoption of XRP. According to him, once the lawsuit is resolved, XRP could see a significant increase in usage and market activity. Implications of a Regulatory Shift Garlinghouse’s remarks imply that the SEC may be re-evaluating its regulatory approach. The enforcement-heavy tactics of the previous administration have faced widespread criticism from industry leaders and policymakers, who argue that such an approach has created uncertainty rather than clarity. If the SEC is indeed adopting a more structured and transparent regulatory framework, this could be a welcome change for blockchain companies operating in the U.S. For Ripple and XRP, the potential shift raises questions about the lawsuit’s future. If the SEC truly intends to “move on quickly,” as Garlinghouse hinted, this could mean an openness to resolving outstanding enforcement actions rather than prolonging them. However, no official confirmation has been provided regarding a resolution, leaving the community in anticipation.

With the market’s constant ebb and flow, it’s easy to miss out on potential goldmines. Let’s dive into two top crypto assets : one that might’ve sailed past you—Near Protocol—and another that’s still docked, waiting for you to hop on board—Qubetics. Near Protocol: The One That Got Away Remember when Bitcoin was just a whisper among tech geeks? Those who got in early are probably lounging on private islands now. Near Protocol had a similar buzz. Launched to tackle scalability issues, it promised faster transactions and lower fees. But if you’re hearing about it now, you might’ve missed the boat. Back in January 2022, Near Protocol hit its all-time high at $20.44. Fast forward to today, and it’s trading around $3.58. That’s a significant drop, but hindsight’s 20/20, right? Analysts had high hopes, predicting it could reach $6.59 by 2025. But the crypto seas are unpredictable, and not all ships sail as expected. So, what happened? The market’s a wild beast. While Near Protocol offered innovative solutions, competition is fierce. Newer platforms emerged, each claiming to be the next big thing. If you didn’t jump on Near Protocol during its peak, you might feel like you missed out. But don’t beat yourself up; the crypto world is full of second chances. Qubetics: Your Ticket to the Next Big Thing Missed out on Near Protocol? Don’t sweat it. Qubetics is here, and it’s making waves. Imagine a world where your online privacy isn’t just a myth. Qubetics offers a decentralized VPN (dVPN) that ensures your data isn’t being hawked to the highest bidder. Traditional VPNs? They’re like using a screen door on a submarine. Centralized and prone to data leaks. Qubetics flips the script with its peer-to-peer network. No central authority means no single point of failure. Whether you’re a journalist dodging censorship or just someone who values their Netflix binge sessions without regional blocks, Qubetics has your back. But wait, there’s more. Qubetics isn’t just about privacy; it’s about opportunity. The crypto presale is in its 22nd stage, and folks are buzzing. Over 484 million tokens sold to more than 20,900 holders, raking in a cool $13.6 million. Right now, $TICS tokens are up for grabs at $0.08073 each. But don’t drag your feet; each stage lasts just seven days, with a 10% price bump every Sunday at midnight. Analysts are whispering sweet nothings about $TICS, predicting it could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale—a juicy 209.67% return on investment. And if the stars align? We might see $1 post-presale and even $15 after the mainnet launch. That’s some serious cheddar. Think about it. An investment of $7,500 today snags you about 92,887 $TICS tokens. If $TICS climbs to $1, you’re looking at $92,887. And if it moonshots to $10? That’s a whopping $928,870. Not too shabby for a day’s work. Interoperability: Bridging the Digital Divide Beyond the dVPN, Qubetics is all about interoperability. In plain English? Making sure different systems play nice together. Picture this: you’re a freelance graphic designer juggling multiple platforms—PayPal, Venmo, crypto wallets. It’s a headache. Qubetics streamlines this mess, allowing seamless transactions across various platforms. Or imagine a business owner dealing with suppliers overseas. Currency conversions, transfer fees, and delays are the norm. With Qubetics, transactions are swift, fees are slashed, and everyone’s happy. It’s like having a universal translator for your financial dealings. Don’t Let This Ship Sail Without You The crypto seas are choppy, and opportunities can slip through your fingers. Near Protocol might’ve been a missed chance, but Qubetics is anchored and ready. With its innovative solutions and a heating up presale, now’s the time to act. Head over to their official site and snag your $TICS tokens before the next price hike. Remember, in the world of crypto, fortune favors the bold. Don’t let this golden opportunity become another “what if.” For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is Qubetics? Qubetics is a decentralized platform offering a VPN service that ensures online privacy through a peer-to-peer network, eliminating centralized control. How can I purchase $TICS tokens? Visit the Qubetics presale page, select your preferred cryptocurrency for payment, enter the desired amount of $TICS tokens, and follow the prompts to complete your purchase. What are the benefits of using Qubetics’ dVPN? Unlike traditional VPNs, Qubetics’ dVPN offers enhanced privacy by operating on a decentralized network, making it resistant to censorship and data breaches. What is interoperability in the context of Qubetics? Interoperability refers to Qubetics’ ability to facilitate seamless transactions across different platforms and systems, simplifying processes for businesses and individuals. Why is there urgency in purchasing $TICS tokens now? The presale is structured in stages, with each stage lasting seven days and a 10% price increase at the end of each stage. Purchasing now secures a lower price before the next hike.

The interaction triggered a $5 billion capital inflow within hours. Binance Coin (BNB) Price Surges 6% amid Kanye West and CZ Chats Binance exchange native coin BNB has been subject to intense market volatility in recent days. Within hours of the Bybit exchange hack , Binance transferred 50,000 ETH to provide emergency support and liquidity for user withdrawals, which successfully helped ease panic and avoid systemic risks. BNB Price Action, Feb 22, 2025 | TradingView BNB price made rapid 6% recovery from Friday’s shock sell-off, as Billionaire rapper and fashion entrepreneur Kanye West, known for his controversial online statements, made enquiries about launching a new crypto project and called Changpeng Zhao’s attention in his latest series of cryptic posts on X (prev. Twitter). Kanye West’s Token Launch Enquiry with CZ Sparks Intense Speculation Kanye West, recognized for his unpredictable ventures in music, fashion, and politics, took to social media on February 22 to discuss cryptocurrency. In a series of posts, he shared screenshots of private messages debating whether to launch his own blockchain rather than simply creating a meme coin. West reposted a message from Mikey Shelton stating, “You are the brand. Whatever it is will do well. Some things are better than others. It’s about who you trust.” This suggested that West is considering a serious blockchain project rather than jumping onto meme coin trends. Another post showed a conversation with Edward, who advised him: “Using Cardano as an example, they had the Cardano token, a wallet system, a whitepaper, a roadmap website, etc. You could set up a similar structure.” Kanye West inquires about BNB | Feb 22, 2025 | Source: X.com/Kanyewest Adding to the speculation, Kanye recently followed Changpeng Zhao on X, making CZ the only person he follows. CZ responded humorously, posting: “DEX is so much harder to use…” further fueling rumors of a collaboration. West’s interest comes amid a growing wave of celebrity-driven crypto projects. In recent years, figures like Iggy Azalea, Caitlyn Jenner, and former NBA stars have launched their own tokens, with mixed results. BNB Price Forecast: $700 Breakout Imminent if CZ Talks with Ye Advance Further BNB price forecast chart suggests strong upside momentum, consolidating above key technical levels. The 12-hour chart shows BNB trading at $669.5, gaining 3.41% on the session. BNB Price Forecast | BNBUSD Bollinger Bands Expansion: The price is pressing against the upper band at $689.8, signaling increasing bullish pressure. A breakout above this level could propel BNB toward $700, particularly if discussions between Kanye and CZ sparks more speculative demand. Volume Delta Surge: Buying volume is outpacing selling pressure. A significant 24.48K increase in volume on the latest green candle aligns with a 5.35% price gain, indicating strong market participation. On-Balance Volume (OBV) Trend: OBV has flipped positive, confirming accumulation. Historically, such a shift precedes sustained rallies, making a retest of $700 likely. A rejection at $689.8 could trigger a short-term pullback to the middle Bollinger Band at $663.1, while the lower band at $636.5 serves as the last line of defense against a broader correction. For BNB to sustain its uptrend, it must establish firm support above $680. A failure to hold this level could invalidate the bullish outlook, leading to increased volatility.

TIA price has climbed 3.80% in the last 24 hours, but it’s still down 83.15% from a year ago. The market sentiment remains bearish, and Celestia is trading below key resistance levels. Meanwhile, FTX token is up 15% in a week as excitement builds around the exchange’s repayment plan, set to begin on February 18. Short-term momentum looks strong, but long-term uncertainty remains. While some tokens are struggling, BlockDAG is growing fast. Its TG Tap Miner now has over 200,000 users, proving to be one of the hottest play-to-earn opportunities. With BDAG projected to hit $1 in 2025, this free mining game is fueling the entire ecosystem, making BlockDAG a top crypto to buy in 2025. BlockDAG’s TG Tap Miner Crosses 200K Users—Why It’s a Game-Changer Mining crypto doesn’t have to be complicated, and BlockDAG’s TG Tap Miner proves it. With over 200,000 users, this Telegram-based game makes earning BDAG as easy as tapping a screen. Each session lets players earn Tap Points, which will convert into BDAG when the blockchain goes live. As BDAG’s price is projected to hit $1 in 2025, early participants are stacking up potential future rewards. The ease of use and growing adoption make BlockDAG’s ecosystem one of the most exciting developments in the space. The BlockDAG presale is another sign of its momentum, with over $197 million raised so far. BDAG is currently priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27, with 18.4 billion coins sold. With plans to list on 10+ major exchanges, the project is attracting serious attention. The presale’s rapid growth shows why many are considering BlockDAG a top crypto to buy in 2025, offering a chance to get in before the price surges. With both the TG Tap Miner and presale driving adoption, BlockDAG is building a strong foundation. The X1 Miner app has already surpassed 500,000 active users, adding to the network’s reach. As the launch approaches, BlockDAG continues to stand out as a top crypto to buy in 2025. Is a Rebound Coming? Latest TIA Price Update The TIA price has gained 3.80% in the last 24 hours, showing some short-term recovery, but the overall trend remains bearish. It is still down 35.92% in the past month and 83.15% over the past year, trading at $3.18. With key resistance at $3.10, $3.17, and $3.23, TIA needs a strong push to break higher. Analysts predict a possible jump to $3.99 by February 22, which would be a 29.66% increase, but sentiment remains weak, with 22 indicators bearish and only 4 bullish. Celestia hit an all-time high of $20.85 in February 2024, making the current TIA price a steep decline from its peak. Technical indicators show mixed signals, with some suggesting further downside. With market uncertainty still in play, breaking past resistance levels will be key for a potential recovery. Can the FTX Token Keep Climbing as Repayments Begin? The FTX token has jumped 15% in the past week, currently trading at $2.2172 after a 2.13% gain in the last 24 hours. The price surge comes as FTX prepares to start creditor repayments on February 18. Wallets with claims under $50,000 will reportedly receive 118% of their owed USD value within three business days. With this repayment plan in motion, speculation is building around whether FTT can push past key resistance levels at $2.8360 and $3.50. Despite recent gains, uncertainty remains. The 50/200-day EMA just recorded a Death Cross, a bearish signal that hints at potential downside. If FTX token breaks below $2.2050, it could fall toward $1.58. On the other hand, if bullish sentiment holds, analysts suggest a possible FTT rally to $5.50 this year, making the next few weeks critical for its direction. Summing Up TIA price is up 3.80% today but still struggling to recover from its 83.15% drop over the past year. Analysts predict a possible move to $3.99, but with sentiment still bearish, breaking resistance will be a challenge. Meanwhile, FTX token has surged 15% in a week, fueled by the exchange’s repayment plan starting February 18. With small creditors set to receive 118% of their claims, FTT is seeing renewed interest, though technical indicators remain mixed. While these tokens face uncertainty, BlockDAG is proving to be a top crypto to buy in 2025. With over 200,000 users tapping to earn BDAG and its presale surpassing $197 million, the ecosystem is expanding fast.

Tokens under $1 often combine strong fundamentals with significant adoption potential, making them an appealing choice. With 2025 expected to be a pivotal year for digital assets, the top 4 altcoins under $1 are gaining momentum. Some of these projects are already making waves with key ecosystem upgrades, while others are leading the charge in Web3, payments, and blockchain innovation. For those seeking value and potential, these altcoins stand out as options worth considering. 1. Web3Bay – Reshaping E-Commerce with Blockchain Web3Bay is redefining online shopping by eliminating intermediaries and giving users full control over transactions. This decentralized marketplace allows buyers and sellers to interact seamlessly using crypto, with its native token, 3BAY, facilitating payments, rewards, and governance. Currently priced at $0.004562625, Web3Bay’s presale has raised over $1.5 million, with more than 375 million tokens sold. The structured presale model increases the token price by 15% per stage, setting the foundation for its launch price of $0.1959. Web3Bay goes beyond traditional e-commerce by integrating blockchain for secure, fee-free transactions while offering governance rights through a DAO. The roadmap for 2025 includes the expansion of crypto payment options, NFT-based commerce, and a transition to full decentralization. As one of the top 4 altcoins under $1 , Web3Bay stands out with practical utility and long-term growth prospects. 2. Cardano (ADA) – A Research-Backed Blockchain for the Future Cardano has built its reputation on a methodical and research-driven approach to blockchain development. Trading at $0.772737, ADA remains an attractive asset for investors looking for long-term blockchain projects with sustainability and scalability in mind. The network continues rolling out upgrades, with a focus on smart contracts, decentralized applications, and institutional adoption. Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, has expressed confidence in ADA’s potential, comparing its trajectory to that of Ethereum and XRP. The 2025 roadmap includes further decentralization, increased DeFi integrations, and expanding real-world applications. As one of the top 4 altcoins under $1 , Cardano’s measured, long-term approach positions it as a strong contender in blockchain development. 3. Stellar (XLM) – Enabling Fast, Global Transactions Stellar remains a dominant player in blockchain-based financial services, offering near-instant and low-cost cross-border transactions. With XLM trading at $0.345041, it provides an accessible entry point for those looking to invest in scalable blockchain infrastructure. Stellar’s ability to process transactions within 3 to 5 seconds, coupled with minimal fees, has positioned it as a preferred choice for businesses and individuals seeking efficient payment solutions. The network continues to expand its partnerships with fintech firms and financial institutions, reinforcing its real-world use cases. As adoption increases, Stellar’s role in the digital finance space strengthens. Among the top 4 altcoins under $1 , Stellar remains a strong option for those who see blockchain as a disruptor to traditional financial systems. 4. Tron (TRX) – Growing Its Role in DeFi Tron has steadily gained recognition for its expanding footprint in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. Currently priced at $0.242291, TRX has recorded a 2.65% gain recently, signaling resilience amid market fluctuations. With its blockchain optimized for speed and low fees, Tron is becoming an increasingly attractive platform for DeFi applications and entertainment-based blockchain services. Beyond its technical capabilities, Tron’s presence in the DeFi space continues to grow. It is frequently cited as a small-cap asset with the potential for significant returns under favorable market conditions. If the DeFi ecosystem expands further, Tron’s utility and adoption could increase, supporting its price growth. With these factors in play, TRX solidifies its position among the top 4 altcoins under $1 as a promising player in the evolving blockchain landscape. Key Highlights! Finding undervalued cryptocurrencies with high potential goes beyond just looking at low prices—it’s about identifying projects with strong fundamentals and meaningful use cases. The top 4 altcoins under $1 listed here bring distinct value propositions, whether through Web3Bay’s decentralized e-commerce model, Stellar’s rapid transaction capabilities, Cardano’s research-driven framework, or Tron’s growing role in DeFi. Each of these projects is positioned for significant developments in 2025. Web3Bay’s presale momentum is growing, while Tron continues expanding its DeFi applications. Meanwhile, Cardano and Stellar remain focused on scaling their ecosystems. With these four cryptos in focus, there’s plenty of room for growth as blockchain adoption accelerates.

According to analysts at JPMorgan, there’s been a notable decline in institutional interest in the crypto industry, particularly through Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts. Institutional Demand Declines, Futures Market Signals Weakness Institutional investors have been a major primer for Bitcoin’s price rallies in the past year and they have been influential in Bitcoin’s break above the $100,000 mark. However, since breaking above this level, the Bitcoin price has failed to push further, which is a sign of a slowdown in institutional investments. Related Reading: Bitcoin Ready For ‘Take Off’—Analyst Reveals Key Signals This slowdown in institutional investments was confirmed by analysts at JPMorgan in a recent note to clients. One of the most pressing revelations from JPMorgan’s analysis is the apparent decline in the Bitcoin and Ethereum futures markets on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The bank’s research highlights a growing trend of backwardation, a scenario in which spot prices exceed futures prices. Typically, a healthy market sees futures contracts priced higher than the spot price due to the expectation of future growth. However, the current inversion suggests that institutional players remain hesitant, likely due to a lack of immediate bullish catalysts. “This is a negative development and indicative of demand weakness,” JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note to clients. “Lower demand from systematic and momentum-driven funds, such as CTAs, has also affected bitcoin and ether futures,” he added. Speaking of bullish catalysts, there has been a major slowdown in the euphoria surrounding crypto-positive developments from the new Trump administration in the US. Any supportive policies or regulatory reforms for the crypto industry are unlikely to take effect until the latter half of 2025. As such, Bitcoin and the rest of the market are currently stuck in limbo without any bullish catalysts and continued profit-taking. Allegations Of Market Manipulation Beyond the shifts in institutional sentiment, suspicions of artificial market suppression have gained traction within the crypto community. Industry leaders, including Samson Mow, CEO of Jan3, have voiced concerns that Bitcoin’s inability to gain sustained upward momentum above $100,000 appears “manufactured.” According to him, some large market participants are selling even as retail buyers are dollar-cost averaging and buying. These allegations are not new, as Bitcoin’s history has been punctuated by periods of suspected price manipulation by whales. The recent influx of more institutional investors even makes this price manipulation more possible than in the previous cycles. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Tightens — CZ Says There’s ‘No Escape’ From Crypto At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $96,180, down by 2% in the past 24 hours. Given the current trend, Bitcoin might continue consolidating around $100,000 in the short term, at least until the second half of 2025. However, long-term price targets from analysts for Bitcoin range from between $150,000 to $2 million.

In an interview with Rob Nelson on Roundtable, Boiron explained that Bitcoin scarcity and growing demand will drive the surge of the token’s price. He said: You’ve got this one asset that has this fixed supply, and all you need to figure out is whether demand is going to increase for this asset or not. It’s literally that simple. Marc Boiron Boiron has high expectations for Bitcoin, claiming the token poses less of a threat to investors in the current market state The CEO argued that Bitcoin is the easiest financial asset to figure out, yet most people don’t understand this concept. He even believes the asset could trade as high as $250,000 in the year, adding that Bitcoin will rise as demand for it grows and supply remains the same. He even pointed to the token’s scarcity as a reason for its potential growth. Moreover, he stated that, given the current market, Bitcoin has less downside risk despite the token’s history of price volatility. Boiron stated that with upcoming regulations, he can see that Bitcoin will pose less of a risk to investors than it typically does. Bitcoin dropped to less than $97,000 on Friday after the Bybit hack Crypto prices dipped on Friday after hackers drained almost $1.5 billion from crypto exchange Bybit. According to security analysts, North Korea’s Lazarus group was responsible for the attack. However, these analysts are overly concerned about the group’s advanced techniques, seeing how they pulled the largest attack in crypto history. Bitcoin fell to less than $97,000, down from close to $100,000 after the attack. Currently, the asset is trading at only $96,581, though it represents a 1.36% rise in the last 24 hours. Ether also slipped by nearly 4%, trading below $2.700. However, the coin is doing so much better now, showing a 5% rise in the last 24 hours to $2,774 . On Friday, Coinglass also reported they were over $500 million in liquidations.

At the same time, Shiba Inu coin has seen its burn rate soar by 2,000%, reducing supply and driving speculation about future prices. While these moves grab attention, a bigger shift might be unfolding in Web3 e-commerce. Web3Bay is reshaping the Shopify model by removing middlemen and fees. This blockchain-powered marketplace gives sellers full control over their stores. With a fast-moving presale, those who act early could join a major shift in online selling. Web3Bay Disrupts E-Commerce: No Middlemen, No Extra Charges! Shopify made it simple for anyone to start an online store, but Web3Bay is going further by cutting out platform fees and third parties. Sellers on Web3Bay maintain complete control without depending on banks, payment processors, or centralized platforms that charge high fees. Transactions happen directly on the blockchain, ensuring lower costs, faster payments, and no risk of frozen funds. This is a game changer for small businesses struggling with hidden fees on platforms like Shopify. Web3Bay is already gaining attention. Its presale has raised over $1.5 million, with the 3BAY token priced at $0.004562625 in the current stage. The price increases by 15% at each stage, offering growth potential for those who get in early. At launch, 3BAY is expected to reach $0.1959, making it one of the most promising presales right now. LTC crypto has shown how decentralized finance is reshaping industries, and Web3Bay is bringing the same approach to online shopping. Sellers connect directly with customers, eliminating platform interference, while buyers enjoy lower prices. As Web3 commerce grows, Web3Bay is positioning itself as a leading platform that could challenge traditional e-commerce giants. Litecoin Eyes ETF Approval as Price Momentum Builds Litecoin is gaining attention as talks of spot ETF approval gain steam. Bloomberg analysts estimate a 90% chance that the SEC will approve Litecoin’s ETF this year, which could attract more traditional traders. With Bitcoin paving the way for crypto ETFs, Litecoin’s solid track record and growing institutional adoption could push its price higher. Recent trends also suggest bullish momentum. Litecoin’s price has climbed 24.3% in the past week, outperforming the broader crypto market’s 5% growth. GameStop’s reported interest in crypto assets, including Litecoin, adds to the excitement. If ETF approval happens, Litecoin could see a surge in demand, making it a coin to watch in 2025. Shiba Inu Coin’s Burn Rate Surges 2,000% as Whale Activity Rises Shiba Inu coin is showing strong on-chain activity, with its burn rate jumping over 2,000% in the past 24 hours. More than 14 million SHIB tokens have been taken out of circulation, increasing speculation about future price movements. Reducing supply has always been key to SHIB’s price potential. Recent large withdrawals by whale wallets—such as the 85.5 billion SHIB moved from Coinbase—suggest growing interest. Unlike Litecoin, which is focused on mainstream adoption through ETFs, Shiba Inu aims to build a long-term ecosystem. Lead developer Shytoshi Kusama has shared an ambitious plan to make SHIB a global player by 2030. With rising burns, whale interest, and strategic growth, SHIB could be gearing up for a significant move. Summing Up! Litecoin could experience a major shift if ETF approval boosts demand from traditional traders. Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu coin is gaining traction with its 2,000% burn rate spike and whale transactions tightening supply, which could affect future prices. Both coins are attracting attention for different reasons. However, Web3 e-commerce is emerging as another major force, with Web3Bay leading the way. With its presale surpassing $1.5 million, Web3Bay offers an alternative to Shopify by giving sellers full control and removing platform fees. As traditional platforms continue to charge high fees, Web3Bay’s model could be the breakthrough that small businesses need as e-commerce evolves.

While Bitcoin (BTC) enjoys a well-deserved surge, whispers are circulating about another cryptocurrency poised to benefit even more significantly. FloppyPepe (FPPE) , an AI-powered meme token, is being tipped for the largest gains. Hence, the question is, why is FloppyPepe (FPPE) attracting so much attention in the wake of the BlackRock massive Bitcoin (BTC) buy-in? BlackRock Go Big On Bitcoin (BTC) With $127M Investment On February 16, BlackRock bought $127 million of Bitcoin (BTC). While BlackRock is known for its large investments, its purchases often show their faith in the token’s growth. However, an analyst has said their recent investment in Bitcoin (BTC) will take an unexpected turn. Crypto veterans expect Bitcoin (BTC) to surge but believe an AI-powered meme token will benefit the most from this transaction. Their rationale is that the combination of this token’s AI feature and its Real-world asset (RWA) attribute will make it a lifeline investment . FloppyPepe (FPPE): A High-Growth AI-powered Meme Token in a Bitcoin-Influenced Market The recent Bitcoin (BTC) surge, triggered by BlackRock’s $127 million investment, dominates news headlines, but seasoned investors pay attention to other developments. FloppyPepe (FPPE) emerged quickly into the spotlight as an AI-powered meme token with significant growth opportunities. Market analysts suggest that this AI-driven coin stands out due to its ability to capitalize on Bitcoin’s (BTC) rising power to draw in both meme enthusiasts and investors seeking quick profits. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is distinct from traditional meme coins because it incorporates AI-driven utilities to strengthen its sustainability. Its AI video agent delivers immediate market analysis for investors to make better decisions. Users will have the opportunity to earn revenue from AI-produced images through a forthcoming text-to-image feature on its Telegram channel. This inventive approach allows FloppyPepe (FPPE) to tap into rapidly expanding areas of the cryptocurrency market. Through its strategic tokenomics model, the FloppyPepe (FPPE) AI-powered Meme token offers more than technology. Through a 3% transaction redistribution system, current holders can earn passive income alongside the benefits of stability and scarcity. By implementing a deflationary burn mechanism, the platform increases asset value and creates opportunities for significant profit growth with rising demand. FloppyPepe (FPPE) prioritizes security and credibility within its fundamental objectives. As such, the network completed a smart contract audit by SolidProof to strengthen its transparency against possible exploits. The project spends a fraction of its revenue on wildlife preservation while showing dedication to improving investor portfolios and creating worldwide change. These elements have improved market trust in this AI-powered meme token. At its current price of $0.0000002 , FloppyPepe (FPPE) presents investors with affordability and profitable potential. Top YouTube crypto influencer NASS Crypto joins market veterans and analysts who support FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) future success. Bitcoin (BTC) leads institutional adoption, but major percentage gains might emerge from AI-powered meme tokens like FloppyPepe (FPPE). This AI-based meme coin stands ready to surpass Bitcoin (BTC) instead of merely following its momentum. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Gains Traction After BlackRock’s Buy-in Bitcoin (BTC) remains the leading cryptocurrency in the world, and BlackRock remains at the top of influential whale networks. Hence, the recent BlackRock investment in Bitcoin (BTC) has strengthened market trust. The most eye-catching aspect of this development is how this move affects altcoins like FloppyPepe (FPPE) . Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent rise demonstrates its established market position, while FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) expected profits demonstrate how the crypto market continues to evolve dynamically. Due to its mix of meme coin characteristics and AI functionalities, this AI-powered meme token benefits from growing interest in intelligent, community-focused projects. While it is uncertain if FloppyPepe (FPPE) will outperform Bitcoin’s (BTC) gains, its rapid growth rate shows it is the most prospective token in the 2025 market. Its affordable entry point makes it an attractive asset for a prosperous crypto market.

Toncoin is hovering near $4 as whale investors pour in $250 million, signaling a possible breakout. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu price is struggling around $0.000016, with whale transactions down 88%, adding pressure on support levels. While these assets fight for momentum, one project is flipping the script with a new way to engage in crypto. BlockDAG just made crypto buying more exciting with its Achievements Page, where users earn XP, complete missions, and level up for exclusive perks. Every action—buying BDAG, referring friends, or engaging with the platform—pushes you higher on the leaderboard. The best crypto to buy now isn’t just about gains; it’s about unlocking power-ups before others do. BlockDAG Turns Crypto Buying Into a Rewards Game BlockDAG has introduced a new Achievements Page, turning every transaction into a chance to earn XP, unlock perks, and climb the leaderboard.

The best crypto to buy now isn’t just about price—it’s about seizing every advantage before the next surge. Whales Drive Big Moves as Toncoin Price Eyes Key Levels Toncoin price is hovering near $4, consolidating after a $250 million whale accumulation over three days. Large investors picked up 68 million TON tokens, signaling confidence in its long-term potential. However, the market is at a crossroads, with low volatility and a tight trading range between $3.70 and $3.90. Technical indicators show mixed signals—while the Money Flow Index (MFI) at 16.79 suggests oversold conditions, the Parabolic SAR remains bearish. If TON breaks past $4.50, a trend reversal could take shape. On-chain data shows diverging trends among holders. Addresses holding 1-100 TON are up 32%, but daily active addresses have dropped 45% since last August, when Toncoin price peaked at $7.50. The market is waiting for a decisive move—whale interest suggests strength, but clearing resistance at $4.50 and $4.79 will be the real test. Whale Exit Signals Pressure as Shiba Inu Price Fights to Hold Support Shiba Inu price has been stuck near $0.000016 for the past two weeks, with whale transactions dropping 88% in that time. On-chain data shows a sharp decline in large-scale activity, with the average transaction size falling from $39,000 to just $4,707. This signals hesitation among big holders, increasing the risk of a drop below $0.000015. Technical indicators also point to uncertainty—the RSI hovers at 40.73, showing weak buying momentum, while the 50-day EMA at $0.00001682 and the 100-day EMA at $0.00001889 remain key resistance levels. Despite the slowdown, some signs suggest a potential reversal. If Shiba Inu price stabilizes and whale activity picks up, a move toward $0.000018 could follow. The meme coin sector is still strong after the DOGE ETF acknowledgment, and renewed hype could bring SHIB back into an uptrend—but bulls need to step in soon. Summing Up Toncoin price is at a critical point, consolidating around $4 while whales accumulate $250 million worth of TON. If it clears $4.50, a breakout could follow, but weak network activity raises concerns. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu price struggles at $0.000016, with whale transactions dropping 88%, increasing risks of a dip below $0.000015 unless buying pressure returns. While TON and SHIB battle resistance, BlockDAG is bringing a new way to engage with crypto. Its Achievements Page turns every action—buying BDAG, referring friends, and platform engagement—into XP and exclusive perks. The best crypto to buy now isn’t just about holding—it’s about leveling up before others do. As BDAG heads toward major CEX listings, those racking up XP now will be first in line for rewards.

Polkadot (DOT) and Hedera (HBAR) are both experiencing key market movements, with DOT pushing past resistance levels and HBAR approaching a potential reversal zone. But while these assets navigate price surges and corrections, Web3Bay is taking decentralization to a new frontier—e-commerce. Much like OpenSea revolutionized NFTs, Web3Bay eliminates intermediaries, giving users full control over online transactions. With a successful presale and rising adoption, Web3Bay presents a first-mover advantage in reshaping digital commerce. Web3Bay Drives the Shift Toward User-Owned E-Commerce Web3Bay isn’t just tweaking existing models—it’s flipping the entire e-commerce structure by prioritizing ownership and decentralization. Traditional platforms like Amazon and eBay act as intermediaries, collecting high fees and controlling transactions. Web3Bay removes these barriers, allowing merchants to retain full control over their stores and profits. Much like how OpenSea transformed NFT trading, Web3Bay is setting the stage for a decentralized marketplace, where sellers operate independently without interference from corporate platforms. Adoption is gaining speed. With over 375 million coins sold and a presale surpassing $1.5 million, Web3Bay is attracting both investors and early adopters. Currently in Stage 4, the presale price has risen to $0.004562625, reflecting increasing demand and confidence in its long-term impact. By integrating smart contracts for secure, transparent transactions, Web3Bay minimizes risks and reduces the fees that have long been a burden on sellers. As decentralization gains traction, Web3Bay presents an alternative to corporate-controlled online markets, offering users an efficient and community-driven commerce solution. Hedera (HBAR) Approaches Key Resistance—Will It Break Through? Hedera (HBAR) is holding ground at $0.228258, reflecting a minor 0.02196% dip from its last close. Intraday movement saw prices fluctuate between $0.239214 and $0.227705, placing HBAR at a key decision point. Looking at broader market patterns, HBAR appears to be finalizing a corrective Wave 4 within its Elliott Wave cycle, having recently tested the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.218. Historically, this range has acted as strong support, suggesting a potential reversal is forming. Technical indicators reinforce this view. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has entered oversold territory, a typical precursor to bullish momentum. Additionally, a descending wedge breakout on the 1-hour chart suggests an imminent upward push. If the current support holds, the next target sits at $0.31, with further resistance at $0.35 and $0.39. However, if HBAR falls below $0.218, traders may see a downward move toward critical support at $0.177. Polkadot (DOT) Surges—Is $10 the Next Stop? Polkadot (DOT) is breaking barriers, pushing past key resistance levels and showing strong bullish momentum. Analysts highlight DOT’s decisive breakout above $7.30, a historically challenging price zone. The move is backed by increasing trading volume and positive on-chain data, signaling growing investor confidence. If this momentum sustains, DOT could reach $8.50 next, with a stronger push toward $10 possible if buying pressure remains. Supporting this outlook, technical indicators such as the RSI and Moving Averages confirm increasing demand, positioning DOT for further gains. Beyond price action, Polkadot’s expanding ecosystem is adding to its strength. Parachain adoption and rising staking participation continue to reinforce its market standing. Still, traders remain cautious of potential market shifts, making $7.00 a key support level to watch. If DOT maintains its current trajectory, further bullish movement seems likely in the coming weeks. Final Thoughts As Polkadot (DOT) breaks through resistance and Hedera (HBAR) hovers near key reversal levels, both highlight the increasing demand for decentralized solutions in the market. However, Web3Bay is approaching decentralization from a different angle—one that could impact real-world commerce on a broader scale. Unlike traditional e-commerce platforms that dictate fees and policies, Web3Bay ensures direct transactions between buyers and sellers. Much like OpenSea changed how NFTs are bought and sold, Web3Bay is shaping the next phase of online trade. With a successful presale and strong adoption trends, it’s not just another blockchain project—it’s a potential game-changer for digital commerce.

With new projects emerging regularly, many crypto enthusiasts are always on the lookout for the next big thing. As we gear up for the next bull run crypto , it’s clear that certain digital assets are primed to dominate the scene. Among them, Qubetics, Ethereum, and Chainlink are making waves in the blockchain industry, each with its unique features and groundbreaking advancements. So, if you’re looking to understand how these players are setting the stage for the future of digital finance, this comparative article will break it down. Ethereum, widely recognized as the pioneer of smart contracts, has been a cornerstone of decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi). The Ethereum network continues to evolve with new improvements, including the transition to Ethereum 2.0, which focuses on scalability, security, and energy efficiency. This shift is expected to propel Ethereum further into the spotlight, and many are betting that it will play a significant role in the upcoming bull run crypto cycle. Meanwhile, Chainlink, the oracle network connecting smart contracts to real-world data, is another vital player in the crypto space. As decentralized applications rely heavily on accurate external data, Chainlink’s integration with various blockchain platforms has positioned it as an essential infrastructure for the entire DeFi ecosystem. With its growing adoption, Chainlink’s impact is only set to grow as we approach the next bull run crypto. But there’s another rising star in the crypto universe that is worth talking about: Qubetics . This innovative project is making waves with its next-gen, non-custodial multi-chain wallet, designed to streamline transactions across different blockchains while ensuring top-notch security. Through its partnerships with 1inch and SWFT, Qubetics is shaping up to be a significant player in the future of blockchain and digital finance. So, how does it compare to the likes of Ethereum and Chainlink? Let’s dive into each of these projects and see what sets them apart. Qubetics: A Game-Changer in Blockchain with Revolutionary Wallet Solutions When we talk about the next bull run crypto, it’s essential to highlight emerging projects that are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. One such project is Qubetics, which is swiftly gaining attention in the crypto community, and for a good reason. With its non-custodial multi-chain wallet, Qubetics is reshaping how users interact with the blockchain. First off, the Qubetics Wallet offers a seamless cross-chain experience, making it easier for users to perform transactions across different blockchain networks. This multi-chain compatibility is essential as the crypto world grows increasingly complex, with various networks and tokens coexisting. But it doesn’t stop there—Qubetics has also partnered with industry leaders like 1inch and SWFT to optimize trading and enhance security. Qubetics’ partnership with SWFT Blockchain introduces a wallet that redefines user expectations. This collaboration focuses on offering lightning-fast transactions and a level of cross-chain functionality that has never been seen before. With SWFT’s cutting-edge technology, users can easily swap assets and manage their portfolios across different blockchains. Security is a top priority, and the Qubetics Wallet boasts advanced encryption to protect users’ funds, making it one of the most secure options available. Moreover, the integration with 1inch further elevates the Qubetics Wallet. 1inch’s DeFi aggregation technology allows users to trade across hundreds of decentralized exchanges, ensuring optimized prices and unmatched liquidity. This means that Qubetics users will benefit from efficient trading with the best possible rates, regardless of market conditions. As the presale for Qubetics continues to gain momentum, analysts are predicting significant returns. The project has already sold over 484 million tokens to more than 20,900 holders, raising over $13.6 million. With the presale entering its 22nd stage, the price of $TICS tokens stands at $0.08073, and experts predict returns as high as 11,380% after the mainnet launch. The Qubetics presale offers an exciting opportunity, but it won’t last forever. In essence, Qubetics is more than just a wallet—it’s a comprehensive solution for anyone involved in decentralized finance, whether you’re an investor, business, or professional. By offering an intuitive user experience and powerful features, Qubetics is perfectly positioned to play a major role in the next bull run crypto. Ethereum: The Blockchain Giant Leading the Way in Smart Contracts Ethereum has long been a foundational element in the world of cryptocurrency, and as we approach the next bull run crypto, its importance remains undeniable. As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum’s blockchain is the go-to platform for smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The Ethereum network’s primary selling point is its ability to execute smart contracts—self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code. This has opened the door for decentralized applications to thrive, and it’s no surprise that Ethereum has become the backbone of the DeFi revolution. Developers and innovators flock to Ethereum for its reliability and scalability, making it an essential player in the next bull run crypto cycle. With the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, Ethereum aims to address its scalability issues and transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). This shift is expected to reduce energy consumption significantly while improving transaction speeds and lowering costs. Ethereum’s move to PoS will also reward holders of ETH with staking rewards, further driving interest in the ecosystem. Despite its dominance, Ethereum does face competition from newer blockchain platforms such as Solana and Avalanche, which offer faster and cheaper transactions. However, Ethereum’s extensive ecosystem, developer support, and ongoing upgrades ensure that it will continue to be a major player in the next bull run crypto. Chainlink: The Oracle Network Powering DeFi Chainlink is another blockchain project that is perfectly positioned for the next bull run crypto. Unlike Ethereum, which is focused on smart contracts and dApps, Chainlink’s main function is to provide reliable, tamper-proof data to smart contracts. Known as an oracle network, Chainlink acts as a bridge between the blockchain and real-world data, enabling smart contracts to interact with external systems, such as price feeds, weather data, and other APIs. Chainlink’s ability to provide accurate and secure data is crucial for the success of decentralized finance applications, which rely on real-time data for their operations. By connecting blockchains to the off-chain world, Chainlink makes it possible for decentralized applications to operate more efficiently and securely. Over the years, Chainlink has integrated with various blockchains and DeFi protocols, establishing itself as the go-to oracle solution for developers. As the DeFi ecosystem grows, Chainlink’s importance will only increase, making it a prime candidate for the next bull run crypto. The Power of the Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, Partnership with 1inch and SWFT As we’ve discussed, Qubetics’ non-custodial multi-chain wallet, in partnership with 1inch and SWFT, is set to reshape how users interact with the blockchain. This wallet is designed to address the challenges of managing assets across multiple blockchains, offering seamless trading, enhanced security, and a user-friendly interface. Whether you’re an investor, business owner, or crypto enthusiast, the Qubetics Wallet is designed to make your blockchain experience smoother, safer, and more efficient. With SWFT Blockchain’s advanced technology and 1inch’s liquidity aggregation, Qubetics is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the crypto space. Users can trade assets across multiple decentralized exchanges with optimized pricing, making it easier to maximize profits. Additionally, the non-custodial nature of the wallet ensures that users maintain full control over their assets, providing a sense of security and ownership that’s essential in today’s digital finance world. Conclusion: As we approach the next bull run crypto, it’s clear that Ethereum, Chainlink, and Qubetics are all playing pivotal roles in shaping the future of blockchain and digital finance. While Ethereum continues to lead the way with its smart contract capabilities, and Chainlink’s oracles provide critical data for decentralized applications, Qubetics is offering innovative solutions that address real-world issues with its cutting-edge wallet technology. The Qubetics crypto presale is an exciting opportunity for those looking to get involved in a project that’s poised to make a significant impact in the crypto space. With a strong community, strategic partnerships, and a forward-thinking approach, Qubetics has the potential to generate significant returns in the next bull run crypto. So, don’t miss out—now is the time to get involved in the future of digital finance.

However, the price now seems to be moving toward a retest of the ascending trendline support. This decline is driven by bearish market sentiment and the recent heist experienced by Bybit. Cardano (ADA) Current Momentum As the ADA price nears the support level, it becomes crucial to see whether the asset will hold this level. If the market does not experience a massive sell-off, the price may stabilize. However, if selling pressure increases, the market will likely continue this trend until sentiment shifts. ADA Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, ADA still holds its upside potential as long as it trades above the ascending trendline or the $0.73 mark. Looking at the daily and four-hour time frames, ADA appears to be forming a bullish cup-and-handle pattern along with an ascending triangle pattern, reinforcing its bullish outlook. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, ADA could soon hit the $0.85 level once it crosses the $0.78 mark. However, given the current market sentiment, if ADA falls and closes a four-hour candle below the $0.74 level, we could witness a heavy sell-off and a notable 10% price drop, bringing it down to the $0.65 level. As of now, the asset is trading below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the four-hour time frame, indicating that it is still in a downtrend. Meanwhile, its Average Directional Index (ADX) stands at 12, suggesting weak trend strength, which could be a key reason why ADA has failed to rally. Current Price Momentum and Over-Leveraged Levels Looking at the current market sentiment, intraday traders are over-leveraged at the $0.76 level on the long side, with $2.23 million worth of long positions. Meanwhile, the $0.785 level is another over-leveraged zone where traders betting on the short side have built $2 million worth of short positions. Source: Coinglass Examining these over-leveraged positions, it appears that bulls are dominating, which could help ADA’s price stay above the crucial trendline. ADA is currently trading near $0.77 and has experienced a modest 0.50% price surge in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume dropped by 50%, indicating fear among traders and investors, leading to lower participation compared to the previous day.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ADA|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-23 02:55:59
40711513,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=701324,1740279623,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/40711513.jpeg,Crypto CEO Calls Start Of The Altcoin Season With A Caveat,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/crypto-ceo-calls-start-of-the-altcoin-season-with-a-caveat/,"According to CryptoQuant’s data, the long-awaited altcoin season may have officially arrived. The CEO of the crypto market company, Ki Young Ju, has pointed out a significant surge in altcoin volume on Centralised Exchanges (CEXs). Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Tightens — CZ Says There’s ‘No Escape’ From Crypto CryptoQuant CEO Says Altcoin Season Has Begun Presenting a detailed price chart of the volume ratio of Bitcoin versus altcoins on CEXs, Ju disclosed that altcoins have been seeing significantly higher trading volume than BTC. Unlike previous bull market cycles, Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) is no longer the sole factor in determining the start of the altcoin season. Some analysts even suggest that the altcoin season is no longer dependent on Bitcoin dominance. Typically, during past altcoin seasons, investors and holders rotated their profits between Bitcoin and altcoins. This time, the CryptoQuant CEO suggests that even stablecoin holders move the market, favoring altcoins more than BTC and directly entering positions. Yu’s chart shows that altcoin volume on CEXs has exceeded that of Bitcoin by 2.71x based on the 90-day Moving Average (MA). Despite this increase, the CryptoQuant CEO warns that the rally set to follow the altcoin season will be selective, and not all altcoins may benefit. During the last bull run, the same event occurred, where only the most prominent coins, with proper utility, robust community, and a grand narrative, skyrocketed. On the other hand, low-cap altcoins experienced an increase, however, not as explosive as the ones recorded by coins like Solana, Cardano, and more. Based on Yu’s analysis the Bitcoin dominance no longer defines an altcoin season; rather, the trading volume does. Historically, a rise in BTC.D is seen as a deterrent to an altcoin season as the market is supposedly more interested in Bitcoin. Conversely, a decline in Bitcoin dominance is an indication of a shift in the market’s sentiment toward altcoins, signaling the possible onset of the altcoin season. Analyst Forecasts A Final Market Decline Before Altcoin Season While the start of an altcoin season could alleviate current bearish pressures on altcoins in the market, uncertainty still looms about whether this highly anticipated and recurring historical trend will occur in this bull cycle. A crypto analyst, identified as the ‘Alternative Bull’ has projected a final decline before the potential start of an altcoin season. The analyst forecasts that the altcoin season index chart will experience a significant drop and then skyrocket towards the 90 threshold before the end of 2025, as seen in the chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin Ready For ‘Take Off’—Analyst Reveals Key Signals Presently, the altcoin market cap, standing at $280.5 billion, has completed the second part of its previously formed Double Bottom pattern. This unique technical pattern is often seen as a bullish indicator, signaling a potential reversal from a downtrend to an uptrend. According to Rekt Capital on X, the altcoin market cap is attempting to break out of this pattern and initiate a bullish move towards a $300 billion valuation.

Jito (JTO) is making waves on the Solana network, having recently breached significant resistance levels, signaling a bullish trend, while PEPE is struggling to regain its footing following a sharp decline. But, it’s Web3Bay ’s 3BAY token that truly stands out, providing concrete utility in the burgeoning field of decentralized e-commerce. Unlike purely speculative tokens, 3BAY offers a multifaceted functionality encompassing staking, governance, and transactional utilities, reminiscent of Binance’s BNB. With a presale that has already amassed over $1.5 million, Web3Bay distinguishes itself as the best crypto investment with practical applications in the real world. Web3Bay’s 3BAY Token: The Best Crypto Investment for Early Backers? Web3Bay’s 3BAY token merges critical elements such as staking, governance, rewards, and transaction utility—akin to Binance’s BNB but with a focus on e-commerce. Token holders can enjoy benefits like passive income through staking, a voice in governance decisions, and discounts on transaction fees, making it a multipurpose asset within the Web3Bay ecosystem. With the presale rapidly progressing and over 375 million coins already sold, raising $1.5 million to date, the buzz around 3BAY continues to build. Currently priced at $0.004562625 per coin in its fourth presale stage, 3BAY offers investors an accessible entry point with substantial upside potential. Market analysts suggest that early adoption coupled with growing platform utilization could potentially drive the token’s value up by 100x, particularly as the demand for decentralized e-commerce solutions intensifies. For those looking for the best crypto investment with tangible utility and significant application in the real world, 3BAY presents an irresistible proposition just as it’s poised to capture the mainstream market. Jito’s Bullish Breakout Eyes $4.60 Amid Surging Demand Jito (JTO), a prominent liquid staking protocol on the Solana network, has recently soared past the crucial $2.90 resistance level, indicating a transition from bearish to bullish market sentiment, which could pave the way for further gains. This breakout has also seen a significant 76.01% spike in trading volume, underlining a growing interest in JTO tokens, while Open Interest has climbed by 6.46%, signaling increased market participation. Currently trading at $3.02 and eyeing the next resistance at $3.50, JTO has its sights set on a $4.60 target. However, sustaining momentum above the $2.90 mark remains key to continuing this bullish trend; failing which could lead to a pullback to support zones around $2.00 to $2.20. PEPE’s Price Struggles: Prospects for a Recovery? PEPE experienced a meteoric rise of nearly 30,000% to a peak of $0.0000283 in December 2024 but then suffered a 70% decline to $0.0000079 by February 2025. Recently, it broke below the $0.0000165 support level, now a formidable resistance, complicating its recovery efforts. Despite a rebound from a 308-day ascending support line suggesting a potential rally, indicators like the RSI and MACD remain bearish, hinting at continued weak momentum. Currently confined within a descending parallel channel—a typical indicator of ongoing corrections—PEPE’s short-term prospects hinge on overcoming this resistance. Long-term wave analysis suggests a potential extended correction phase lasting until December 2025, with a low target of $0.0000022. While there’s some optimism for short-term gains, PEPE faces significant hurdles ahead. Concluding Thoughts While Jito (JTO) capitalizes on its bullish momentum and PEPE grapples with overcoming resistance, Web3Bay’s 3BAY token stands out as a Best Crypto Investment with its foundation in real-world utility. Market fluctuations offer short-term opportunities, but the enduring value of a crypto asset is anchored in solid use cases. With 3BAY’s combination of staking, governance, and transaction benefits designed for the decentralized e-commerce space, it offers more than speculative potential. The strong presale performance, accumulating over $1.5 million, reflects robust investor confidence in 3BAY. As the cryptocurrency landscape matures, utility-focused tokens like 3BAY are likely to sustain growth, making them a prudent choice over alternatives driven by hype alone.

The token initially surged to $1.84 but quickly dropped to $0.64 as trading activity intensified. This early sell-off suggested that many holders took the opportunity to liquidate their tokens after the network transitioned to an open trading environment. However, the price has since rebounded dramatically, increasing by 97% in the last 24 hours. This rapid rise has made Pi the top trending coin on CoinMarketCap. Additionally, a community vote on Binance showed that 85% of users supported listing PI on the platform, which has further fueled interest in the coin. In just one day, Pi Coin saw an impressive 159.83% surge in price, reaching as high as $1.72 before stabilizing around $1.40. This rebound reflects strong buying interest and renewed confidence from the Pi Network community. Currently, Pi Coin is priced at $1.32, with a high of $1.52 and a low of $0.72. The price has shown signs of a bullish rally after breaking through key resistance levels, but some signs of potential short-term pullbacks are also emerging, with some traders noting bearish RSI divergence. Looking ahead, analysts are watching whether Pi will be able to maintain its momentum. If the price can hold above $1.10, there may be potential for further growth. However, if the coin fails to sustain its current price levels, it could face a pullback toward $0.94 to $1.00.

However, amid these established names, a fresh, vibrant token is emerging, catching the attention of shrewd traders with its promise of phenomenal value growth. With the bullish wave sweeping through the market, these opportunities are ripe for exploration, offering tantalizing prospects for unprecedented returns. The Enigmatic Allure of Catzilla: From Quirky Concept to Potential Powerhouse At the heart of this crypto adventure is Catzilla ($CATZILLA), a coin that marries the whimsical worlds of kaiju culture, internet memes, and digital currency. This peculiar blend is more than meets the eye. Beneath its playful façade lies a robust framework, evidenced by its structured presale and an expanding community driving the project forward. A Journey Through Catzilla’s Presale: The Strategic Path Ahead Catzilla's presale is ingeniously segmented into 14 stages, a tactic that ensures continued investor engagement. Each stage witnesses a price increment, rewarding early adopters with more favorable entry points. Insight into Current Presale Metrics: Current Price: $0.0009 Next Stage Price: $0.0010 Final Presale Price: $0.0016 Funds Raised So Far: $2.2M+ and growing Presently at Stage 7, there's palpable optimism within the CoinMarketCap community about its trajectory. As prices ascend with each stage, investors are eyeing these early stages for advantageous positions before market debut. Catch the $CATZILLA Wave Before It Escalates What Distinguishes Catzilla in the Meme Coin Universe? Although memes often drive coin popularity, Catzilla boasts additional merits besides mere viral charm. A Unique Concept The coin’s identity is rooted in a kaiju-style narrative, where a massive cat mascot wrecks havoc and collects rewards, offering a playful yet compelling storyline. Engaging Diverse Communities By intertwining anime, gaming, and meme cultures, Catzilla extends its appeal beyond typical crypto enthusiasts, aiming to draw: Investors seeking novel early-stage endeavors Fans of internet-driven viral phenomena Anime and gaming aficionados captivated by the kaiju motif Such a diverse audience base could bolster its long-term sustainability. Fostering Community Engagement A cornerstone of Catzilla's strategy is fostering robust community participation through governance voting, staking benefits, and play-to-earn elements, enhancing ecosystem vibrancy and longevity. Evaluating the Investment Proposition The presale is unfolding at a brisk pace, and with incremental price increases per stage, timing becomes crucial. Like most meme coins, it presents speculative risks but also significant potential, particularly with its gaming integration and community incentives. The project's future hinges on executing its roadmap effectively, making it a token worth monitoring closely. Consider the $CATZILLA Opportunity Cardano's Dual-Layer Advantage: A Deep Dive Cardano, renowned for its environmentally conscious proof-of-stake mechanism, leverages its dual-layer architecture to enhance scalability and smart contract execution. Its Settlement Layer handles transactions efficiently, while the Computing Layer supports complex contracts. These capabilities position ADA as a formidable player in the crypto landscape, promising scalability and lower transaction costs. Solana: Innovating with Scalability Solana focuses on delivering unmatched scalability, positioning itself as a robust platform for decentralized applications. Unlike its peers, it eschews sharding and second-layer solutions, opting for a unique architecture that enhances its high-capacity network. This, coupled with SOL's role in fueling the ecosystem, underscores its appeal to developers and investors alike. Wrapping Up While Cardano and Solana pursue ambitious price targets, Catzilla emerges as a compelling alternative, especially during its presale phase, with features that integrate community participation and game mechanics. It represents a vibrant opportunity for those ready to embrace its speculative allure and potentially considerable returns.

40715405,https://invezz.com/?p=2582142,1740282411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Crypto price predictions: Mantra, DeXe, Toncoin, IOTA",https://invezz.com/news/2025/02/23/crypto-price-predictions-mantra-dexe-toncoin-iota/,"Crypto prices rebounded during the weekend, with the total market of all coins soaring to over $3.20 trillion and the fear and greed index moving to the neutral level. This rebound was driven by speculation among crypto investors, who believe that these coins will do well this year. This article explores some of the top coins, including Mantra (OM), DeXe (DEXE), Toncoin (TON), and IOTA (IOTA). Mantra (OM) price forecast OM chart by TradingView Mantra price has done well in the past 12 months as it moved from being a fairly small coin into a $7 billion juggernaut. Its price has moved from $0.09 in 2023 to over $9 for the first time. The weekly chart shows that the OM price has soared in the past five consecutive months, beating other popular coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It has done this because of its high staking yield, regular airdrops to holders, and the fact that it is in the fast-growing Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization industry. Mantra price has remained above all moving averages, while all oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the stochastic oscillator have moved to the overbought level. There are signs that it remains in the markup phase of the Wyckoff Theory, which is characterized by high demand. Therefore, there is a likelihood that the Mantra price will keep soaring as bulls eye the target point at $10, and then resume the downtrend. Toncoin price analysis TON chart by TradingView Toncoin, the crypto project by Telegram, has been under pressure since Pavel Durov’s legal issues started in France a year ago. The TON price has crashed, while the total value locked (TVL) in its DeFi ecosystem has crashed. Most notably, the ecosystem has not done well, with tokens of most of its tap-to-earn games like Hamster Kombat and Notcoin crashing. The weekly chart shows that the TON price has retreated in the past few months after peaking at $8.24 in June last year. It has moved below $4, and crashed below the 50-week and 100-week moving averages. The MACD and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) have all pointed downwards, a sign that it is losing momentum. Therefore, the TON price will likely continue falling as sellers target the key support at $2.9154, the highest swing in October 2022. A drop below that point will point to a further retreat to $2. DeXe price forecast DeXe Protocol is a Web3 governance protocol whose token is well-known for the substantial staking yields it offers to its holders. Like Mantra, DEXE price has done well in the past few months as it surged from $1.87 in October last year to $20 in 2025. The DeXe token price has recently moved above the key resistance level at $18.18, the highest swing on April 1. This was an important price since it was the upper side of the cup and handle pattern, one of the most bullish patterns in the market. It is now in the handle phase, which is known for some consolidation. The DeXe price remains above the 50-week moving average, while the RSI and MACD are pointing upwards. Therefore, the price will likely explode higher in the long-term, with the next point to watch being at $27.20, the highest swing in November 2021. IOTA price analysis IOTA chart by TradingView The daily chart shows that the IOTA price peaked at $0.6362 in December last year and has now plunged to $0.2280. The 100-day and 50-day exponential moving averages are about to form a bearish crossover pattern, which is widely seen as a mini death cross. On the positive side, there are signs that it is about to form a bullish divergence pattern as the RSI and the MACD point upwards. It has also formed a falling wedge chart pattern, a popular bullish reversal sign. Therefore, the IOAT price will likely have a strong bullish breakout, with the next reference level being at $0.35.

The JV intends to apply for a license under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) new regulatory framework. HKD-Backed Stablecoin According to the official press release , SCBHK, Animoca Brands, and HKT have engaged in HKMA’s stablecoin issuer sandbox since July 2024. The trio has been assessing how stablecoins can facilitate financial market development and payments by connecting Web3 and traditional finance. The partnership is in line with Hong Kong’s ambition to strengthen its role as a global digital assets hub. By leveraging expertise across banking, telecommunications, and blockchain, the JV aims to create a secure and regulatory-compliant stablecoin framework. The initiative aligns with the city-state’s broader strategy to boost digital finance adoption while ensuring compliance with evolving regulatory requirements. In an official statement, Bill Winters, Group Chief Executive of Standard Chartered, said, “Digital assets are here to stay and the development of different forms of tokenized money is integral to the advancement of this industry. That is why we are actively involved in various Central Bank Digital Currencies, tokenized deposits, and, of course, stablecoins projects. We are introducing solutions and instruments that service this market and meet the growing client demand. As public chain instruments with proven use cases, stablecoins play a critical role in the overall digital asset ecosystem.” Hong Kong Eyes Bitcoin as a Strategic Asset Besides the ambitious stablecoin initiative, Hong Kong is also considering adding Bitcoin (BTC) to its fiscal reserves as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. Wu Jiexhuang, a Hong Kong legislative council member, recently proposed using foreign exchange funds to acquire Bitcoin, citing potential benefits such as attracting talent, boosting the local crypto industry, and increasing tax revenue. He said that leveraging China’s “one country, two systems” framework, adding Bitcoin to Hong Kong’s reserves could give the region an early advantage and help mitigate economic instability from its wider adoption in traditional financial markets.

Once regarded as a top-tier blockchain network, Solana (SOL) now struggles with network congestion, security concerns, and competition from emerging AI tokens. Investors who previously looked to Solana (SOL) for high-growth opportunities are now shifting their focus toward AI tokens for scalability but groundbreaking advancements. The recent setbacks in the Solana (SOL) price performance and market volatility have raised concerns about the Solana (SOL) long-term viability, reinforcing the urgency for investors to explore more opportunities like FloppyPepe (FPPE). FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Explosive AI Agent Token FloppyPepe (FPPE) represents the evolution of AI-driven cryptocurrencies, positioning itself as the most promising AI agent token for 2025. The project’s unique AI-powered ecosystem is designed to transform content creation and user engagement, setting it apart from the wave of speculative tokens in the market. The AI agent token has Meme-o-Matic , a state-of-the-art AI meme generator that allows users to input text, video clips, and images, instantly converting them into viral content. This advanced AI agent token utility elevates FloppyPepe (FPPE) beyond meme coin status. FloppyPepe (FPPE) has already proven its market appeal, raising $500,000 in the first three days of its presale. The private round sold out at an astonishing $907,200 in just 24 hours, signaling the overwhelming demand for this AI agent token. With an AI beta launch scheduled for next week, the project is on track to surpass $1 million in presale revenue in its first week alone. Compared to any other AI agent token with a larger market cap, FloppyPepe (FPPE) still has enormous room for growth. The platform’s AI-powered video generation tool, FloppyX , empowers users to create top-tier video content with automated pipelines and character consistency features. Meanwhile, its text-to-image AI agent , launching on Telegram in two weeks, will further solidify its standing as a transformative AI project. Unlike the countless rug-pull meme coins flooding the market, this AI agent token guarantees authenticity through multi-signature wallets, a bug bounty program, and a smart contract audited by SolidProof. With plans for multi-chain integration across Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Solana (SOL), this AI agent token is set to capture an even broader investor base. The FloppyPepe (FPPE) ecosystem continues to gain traction, supported by a rapidly growing Telegram and X (Twitter) community, reinforcing its status as one of the most community-driven AI tokens in the market. With a 1% token burn mechanism built into its tokenomics, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is designed to increase in value as supply decreases over time. The redistribution model assures that investors can stake their tokens and receive rewards, with 3% of every transaction redistributed to the community, further incentivizing long-term holding. Experts predict that FloppyPepe (FPPE) could surge from the price of $0.0000002 by an astonishing 12,560%, turning even modest investments of $1,000, $5,000, or $10,000 into life-changing returns. With AI agent tokens dominating the market, now is the time to secure an early position before prices skyrocket. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is Taking Over The AI crypto sector is experiencing explosive growth, and FloppyPepe (FPPE) is at the forefront as the most compelling AI agent token on the market. With its presale raising $500,000 in just three days and its AI beta set to launch next week, the project is on an unstoppable trajectory toward massive gains. Its powerful AI-driven trading strategy, coupled with its forward-thinking DeFi applications, make it the ultimate AI investment for 2025. As Solana (SOL) struggles to maintain its relevance, the opportunity to capitalize on the next wave of AI crypto evolution is here. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is the future of AI-agent cryptocurrencies, and the time to adopt it is now.

The crypto market has been under strain since the highs of mid-January, but some changes stand out more than others. Ripple XRP is facing a key moment with a potential XRP ETF on the table, which could bring new institutional interest. Meanwhile, the Solana network is dealing with short-term price drops due to upcoming token unlocks but remains a strong force in blockchain development. Both assets are making moves, but they aren’t the only ones changing the game. While XRP and Solana push forward, a new force in Web3 and ecommerce is gaining attention. Web3Bay is taking on traditional marketplaces like Amazon and eBay, cutting out middlemen and giving users direct control over their transactions. The project has gained fame when crypto experts were found discussing its potential. Could this shift redefine online shopping the same way XRP is transforming payments? Web3 and E-commerce: A Shift Away from Traditional Marketplaces For years, online shopping has been dominated by centralized platforms like Amazon and eBay, which control transactions and charge high fees. Web3Bay is taking a different approach, offering a decentralized marketplace where buyers and sellers interact directly without intermediaries. Built on blockchain technology, it ensures transparency, security, and lower costs—all while giving users full ownership of their data and transactions. Its presale numbers show strong demand. Web3Bay has raised over $1.5 million, with more than 375 million 3BAY tokens sold. Currently in Stage 4 of 28, 3BAY is priced at $0.004562625, with prices increasing at each stage. By the time of launch, the token is expected to hit $0.1959, delivering an ROI of 6,430% to early participants. On top of the strong presale numbers, Web3Bay has also raised a lot of discussions about its disruptive potential and long-term returns, becoming a favourite of crypto Twitter. Just as Ripple XRP is reshaping cross-border payments and the Solana network is fueling decentralized applications, Web3Bay is positioning itself as the future of online shopping. With traditional platforms under pressure for high fees and control over users, a decentralized alternative like Web3Bay could become the go-to marketplace for Web3 commerce. Ripple XRP: ETF Speculation and Market Moves Ripple XRP is trading around $2.57, with its price movements closely tied to regulatory developments. The U.S. SEC is reviewing an application for an XRP ETF, which, if approved, could open the door for institutional investors. This would be a game-changing moment for XRP, making it more accessible to a broader market. Meanwhile, Ripple is expanding its real-world use cases, with recent efforts to integrate tokenized U.S. Treasuries on the XRP Ledger, further positioning it as a key player in blockchain-based finance. However, XRP isn’t the only crypto at a crossroads. The Solana network is facing its own challenges, but its long-term potential remains strong. As XRP navigates regulatory hurdles, Solana is dealing with supply pressures that could impact its price in the coming weeks. Solana Network: Price Pressure vs. Long-Term Strength The Solana network is currently priced at $166.31, with a recent 9% decline adding short-term uncertainty. A major factor behind this drop is the upcoming March 1 token unlock, which could flood the market with more SOL. Additionally, network activity has slowed, with active addresses dropping 55% since November 2024. Despite this, Solana remains a top choice for developers due to its high-speed, low-fee transactions, keeping it well-positioned for future growth. Market sentiment around Ripple XRP and other major cryptos is also influencing Solana’s price. Political shifts, such as Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance, have added optimism to the space, but overall volatility remains a challenge. While short-term uncertainty looms, Solana’s core technology and growing adoption could fuel a recovery in the long run. But while XRP and Solana focus on finance and blockchain infrastructure, Web3Bay is bringing blockchain’s benefits to an entirely different industry—online shopping. Key Insights Ripple XRP is at a key moment, with potential ETF approval bringing fresh opportunities. Meanwhile, the Solana network faces short-term price swings but continues to be a strong player in blockchain development. Both projects are driving innovation in their respective sectors, but Web3Bay is taking blockchain to an entirely new space—online commerce. Instead of just being another crypto project, Web3Bay is offering a real-world use case in Web3 and e-commerce, cutting out middlemen and empowering users. With a rapidly selling presale and a 6,430% ROI projected by launch, it’s shaping up to be one of the most disruptive platforms in the space. As the push for decentralization grows, Web3Bay could redefine online shopping in the same way XRP and Solana are transforming finance.

The price is currently facing resistance between $2.65 and $2.80. On the downside, there is significant support around $2.50, and below that, a stronger support zone between $2.25 and $2.30. Resistance Levels According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, the primary resistance zone for XRP lies between $2.65 and $2.80. The price has yet to break above this range, and until it does, the upward movement remains limited. If XRP can close above the $2.80 mark with confirmed candles, we could see a continued upward movement towards $3. Once reaching $3, however, the price could encounter resistance again around this level. Support Levels On the downside, XRP has decent support at around $2.50. Should the price fall below this level, there is stronger support in the range of $2.25 to $2.30. If the price fails to hold these levels, it could signal further downside potential. Long-Term Predictions On the larger time frame, XRP began a rally in July and has been following a potential upward structure. The key support area is between $1.20 and $1.27, and as long as the price stays above this range, the bullish outlook remains intact. This sideways range between $1.20 and $4.20 has been a common pattern for XRP, and it could continue for a while. The current price movement suggests the upside may still be incomplete, and a break above the previous highs of $2.65 to $2.80 could signal a continuation toward the $5-$6 target range for the next cycle.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-23 04:07:39

Some, like Bitcoin, Mantra, and BNB have become highly popular and rewarding to their investors. Mantra has had quadruple gains in the past 12 months. Ghost chains refer to layer-1 and layer-2 blockchains that don’t have a thriving ecosystem of applications. These chains differ from other popular ones like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche that have an active ecosystem. So, this article explores some of the most overvalued ghost chain crypto coins to avoid in 2025. Cardano (ADA) Cardano is the most overvalued ghost chain crypto coin in the industry, with a market cap of over $27 billion. It has become the 9th biggest cryptocurrency in the world, making it bigger than popular tokens like Avalanche, Stellar, and Litecoin. Cardano’s popularity surged in 2021 when it was seen as the best alternative to Ethereum, which was then a proof-of-work (PoW) network. At its peak, Cardano was valued at over $90 billion. Today, Cardano is a ghost chain with no ecosystem. According to DeFi Llama , Cardano has a total value locked (TVL) of over $368 million and just $21 million in stablecoins. A closer look at its ecosystem shows that most of the biggest players are not popular. Liqwid, the biggest lending network in Cardano has a TVL of just $81 million. In contrast, AAVE, the biggest lending player in DeFi has over $20 billion. Minswap, the biggest DeX netwok in Cardano, handles less than $10,000 in volume a day. Near Protocol (NEAR) Near Potocol is another large ghost chain in the crypto industry. The NEAR token has a market cap of over $4 billion, making it the 29th biggest player in the crypto industry. Near Protocol is a layer-1 network that aims to be a better alternative to Ethereum and Cardano. It was one of the first chains to incorporate the concept of sharding, which slashed blocks into shards to supercharge its throughput. Near Protocol is a ghost chain because of its relatively small ecosystem. It has just 30 dApps in the decentralized finance industry. Burrow, a lending protocol, is the biggest dApp in the Near Protocol ecosystem with a TVL of $125 million. It is followed by Ref Finance, a DEX network that handles little volume a day. Near Protocol has established itself as a top c rypto coin in the artificial intelligence industry, but there are no major notable dApps so far. Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) Hedera Hashgraph is another overvalued ghost chain coin in the crypto industry. HBAR token has gained a market cap of over $9 billion. This growth was mostly because of its huge partnerships with top companies like IBM, Google, and Servicenow. HBAR token has also surged as odds of a spot Hedera ETF rose. Hedera Hashgraph has a relatively small ecosystem to justify the $9 billion market cap. It only has a total value locked of just $114 million, down from $214 million earlier this month. The biggest players in the ecosystem are Stader, SaucerSwap, and Bonzo Finance. Other popular ghost chain crypto coins to avoid There are many other popular ghost chain crypto coins to avoid this year. The most notable of them are Algorand , Stacks, Celo, Injective, Internet Computer, and XDC Network. To be clear: at times, these ghost chain crypto coins may surge in the long term. That’s because it is always difficult to value a cryptocurrency. Besides, mene coins, which have no utility have a combined market cap of over $73 billion, with the biggest ones being the likes of Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe.

The American rapper and businessman had yet another full-on Nazi meltdown, after failing to get Changpeng Zhao’s (CZ) phone number. Ye first teased plans for launching his “real” coin, then spiraled into a racial slur-filled tirade, as per usual. The hitmaker shared a chat with Mikey Shelton, who told him, “You are the brand. Whatever it is will do well. Some things are better than others. It’s about who you trust.” Another message showed Edward explaining , “Using Cardano as an example, they had the Cardano token, a wallet system, a whitepaper, a roadmap website, etc. You could set up a similar structure.” Kanye follows CZ, demands his number, then snapped Ye had suddenly followed Binance’s CZ on X Saturday, making him the only person he followed. The action immediately triggered collaboration rumors within the community, which CZ fueled with lighthearted replies to Ye’s tweets. Kanye then publicly asked CZ for his number, writing: “Wait Why all these n*ggas HONKEYS Jews & f*ggots won’t give me CZ’s number?” Moments later, he posted, “Oh wait CZ DM’d me I still stand on what I said though.” Ye was referring to the fact that CZ had commented under his tweet asking for the number and said “DM’ed you,” along with a laughing emoji. As of press time, CZ remains unfollowed by Ye, who has replaced him with Polychain Capital founder Olaf Carlson-Wee and grifter Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports. Then, Ye posted an edited/rebranded Binance logo featuring a swastika with the caption, “New Binance Logo.” Yeah, it’s that bad. Now folks in the community are saying Binance’s CZ is definitely backing out of the collaboration now. CZ, notably, has remained quiet, but we don’t see how he’s gonna get over this. Community Notes warn Kanye’s crypto posts are a scam As Kanye rambled about his Nazi-inspired crypto (Swasticoin), Community Notes flagged his tweets, claiming he “sold access to his account to Christian Barker, aka @barkmeta on X.” Users pointed out suspicious changes in dark/light mode and time formats in his screenshots, saying that multiple people were posting from his account. One note read, “This will be a major liquidity extraction event.” Another warning said, “It appears that Ye has sold access to his X account to a known crypto scammer. His tweets may promote a malicious token launch and are intended to scam users. Please be cautious and avoid engaging with these tweets or any related links.” Ye posted a video of himself to prove he didn’t sell the account, with Olaf of Polychain. He has now ignored the warnings and keeps posting erratically. He declared, “I’M PUTTING MY SWASTICOIN ON A DEX BECAUSE ITS DECENTRALIZED.” Ye also said that his token was already attracting attention, writing, “PEOPLE WHO DIDN’T LIKE THE NAZI POSTS HITTING ME UP FOR THE CA ON MY SWASTICOIN. Wait What’s a CA?” At the same time, Kanye insisted he was creating a legitimate financial system. In one post, he wrote, “YEEZY IS HERE TO CREATE A REAL CURRENCY ANY FIELD I GO INTO I LEARN FROM THE BEST AND TREAT THEIR LIFE LONG WORK WITH THE HIGHEST RESPECT.” But minutes later, he contradicted himself again, stating, “I TRULY LIKE JEWISH PEOPLE THEY JUST CAN NO LONGER BE THE CREATIVE DIRECTORS OF THE PLANET THEY ARE THE BULLIES, NO I’M THE BULLY.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Are You Making These Web3 Resume Mistakes? - Find Out Here",News|Binance,EN,0,0,BNB|EXCHANGE|ADA|PEOPLE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-23 04:36:35

This issue is gaining renewed attention after rapper Kanye West, who now goes by “Ye,” announced plans to launch a so-called “Swasticoin” in a series of controversial social media posts. West’s statements, which included antisemitic remarks about the Jewish community, mark a shift from his previous criticism of celebrity-backed coins that “prey” on fans. You might also like: Kanye West’s Super Bowl 2025 ad sparks Nazi-themed crypto frenzy On Saturday, West seemingly changed his mind. “I’m going to open the CA [contract address] for my Swasticoin to Jewish people and my friends and family first,” he wrote. Alongside this announcement, the “Jesus Walks” singer appeared to seek guidance on blockchain networks like Ethereum, Solana and BNB Chain, while also attempting to contact Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao. The posts sparked backlash, but they also highlighted a broader issue: the increasing number of meme coins promoting extremist ideology. A troubling trend Ye’s proposed token is not an isolated case. Over the past year, a wave of racist and offensive tokens have launched, prompting discussions about whether decentralized platforms should implement content moderation. Some of these tokens used racial slurs or Nazi imagery in their branding, attempting to gain traction in online extremist communities. “Hitler Musk,” for example, appeared on Pump.fun about a month ago after X owner Elon Musk, while speaking at President Donald Trump’s inauguration event, did a straight-a rm salute twice (observers interpreted it as a reference to Nazi-fascism). Before that, in 2021, a token named “HITLER” briefly surfaced before being delisted from exchanges. Another coin, “Groyper,” has been linked to far-right online communities. Despite the fleeting nature of these projects, their presence underscores how blockchain technology—while open and permissionless—can be exploited to spread harmful ideologies. Who’s addressing the issue? As racist meme coins proliferate, some in the crypto industry are taking steps to curb their spread. The Solana Foundation has acknowledged the problem, with Austin Federa, the foundation’s head of strategy, suggesting that in-app filtering could be a potential solution. This would allow wallet apps and decentralized exchanges to screen out tokens with offensive names or imagery. However, implementing such measures in a decentralized system remains a challenge. Racist meme coins can be dealt with by in-app filtering, argues @SolanaFndn 's @Austin_Federa , @thesamreynolds writes https://t.co/e6U1FGVgng — CoinDesk (@CoinDesk) March 29, 2024 Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has also criticized the rise of meme coins associated with dictatorships and racist themes , calling for higher-quality projects in the crypto space. Last March, Buterin expressed concern over the growing number of speculative assets that provide little value beyond short-term hype. He specifically pointed to Solana-based meme coins that he described as “openly super-racist” and condemned tokens linked to totalitarian regimes. Buterin emphasized that he has “zero enthusiasm” for projects driven by scams, rugpulls, or fleeting excitement that ultimately disappoints investors. But, in today’s day and age, where anyone can launch a token with meme coin generators (i.e., Pump.fun) without oversight. As a result, the problem persists. What’s Next? According to Coindesk, West’s planned token—possibly named “YZY” rather than “Swasticoin”—is intended as a workaround for Shopify’s restrictions on his Yeezy store. Reports suggest he plans to keep 70% of the token’s supply for himself, further fueling speculation that this is more about financial gain than ideology. This would align with Ye’s previous attempts to monetize Nazi imagery, including selling T-shirts labeled “HH-01” (widely interpreted as shorthand for “Heil Hitler”), which were removed after a Super Bowl ad directed traffic to his website. Despite Ye’s claim that the token will launch next week, it remains unclear if the project will materialize—or if it is another instance of inflammatory rhetoric designed to provoke outrage. His latest post simply read: “Time to launch my own blockchain,” leaving his actual crypto ambitions uncertain. West was reportedly inspired by Official Trump ( TRUMP ), the meme coin President Trump launched two days before his second inauguration. It’s currently down 78% from its all-time high. Trump raised eyebrows for his similarly massive insider-ownership distribution: 80% of TRUMP is currently held by CIC Digital, a business entity with ties to the president. Ye, too, wanted an 80% ownership stake but was negotiated down to 70%, CoinDesk. Should his token achieve even a fraction of TRUMP’s success, his stake could still be worth many millions of dollars. What is certain, however, is that racist meme coins continue to test the boundaries of crypto’s “wild-west” nature while industry leaders grapple with how to moderate offensive content.

40715412,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=680691,1740286827,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40715412.jpeg,Robinhood CEO declares prediction markets the “future” of trading and information,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/robinhood-prediction-markets-are-future/,"Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev is optimistic about the prediction market’s potential, noting that his company is betting big on it. He compared prediction markets to traditional news sources, asserting that prediction markets communicate information more quickly than newspapers or broadcast media. In an interview, Tenev described the potential of prediction markets and their place in Robinhood’s business model. The CEO of Robinhood believes without a doubt that prediction markets are the future of trading and information. Robinhood’s election prediction market sees record activity Robinhood saw a lot of activity around the prediction market for the 2024 U.S. presidential election. The platform tracked Donald Trump’s victory to a large extent, although Kamala Harris had a late surge after an Iowa poll was found to be inaccurate. Increased interest in the election drove a spike in prediction markets across multiple betting platforms. Robinhood had previously launched Super Bowl event contracts earlier this year but suspended their rollout after a CFTC request. Yet amid regulatory uncertainty, Tenev is optimistic about the future of the sector. He noted prediction markets are here to stay and asserted that this will be revealed over time. Tenev made the company’s broader aims for prediction markets known during Robinhood’s Q4 2024 earnings call. “We had more than half a billion contracts traded in just about a week leading into the election. You can expect a full events platform from us, with access to prediction markets across many diverse contracts later this year,” said Vlad Tenev Aside from Robinhood’s efforts, several major players, such as UMA, Polymarket, and EigenLayer, are working together to build a next-generation oracle infrastructure for prediction markets. This joint effort has several advantages, including improved mechanisms for resolving disputes, aligned participant incentives, and scalability and security. Advanced oracles shape decentralized truth in prediction markets Since its launch in 2020, Polymarket—the leading decentralized prediction market—has passed $6 billion in lifetime volume and resolved 14,000+ markets. Oracle systems available today do not scale well and suffer from subjective market outcomes. To solve these limitations, UMA , Polymarket, and EigenLayer are joining forces to research and develop the next-generation generation oracle based on EigenLayer’s intersubjective verification and UMA’s Optimistic Oracle (OO). With multi-token dispute resolution, the use of different tokens for staking and governance, and several other fundamental improvements, this next-generation mechanism will be a great leap forward as compared to our current system. In addition, it introduces dynamic bonding and AI integration, establishing dynamic bond commitments designed to strengthen economic security. The new oracle will also have improved bribery resistance through the security model of EigenLayer, which minimizes manipulation threats in the new oracle and increases scalability for high-volume markets, increasing dispute resolution efficiency for markets with thousands of active contracts. Polymarket’s founder, Shayne Coplan, highlighted the need for solid oracle solutions, noting that integrating Polymarket’s infrastructure, UMA’s optimistic oracle and EigenLayer’s security framework will reshape the establishment of decentralized truth. With Robinhood and the top players in the blockchain industry leading the charge, prediction markets could soon become a mainstream instrument for real-time, data-informed forecasting in multiple industries.

At the same time, Avalanche continues to struggle, and buyers are taking advantage of the discounted price. Lunex Network is also recording high adoption rates as the broader market sentiment is slowly but surely turning bullish. Litecoin (LTC) Could Become Third US Spot ETF with $580 Million Yearly Inflow Canary Capital filed an application for a Litecoin ETF in October 2024, making analysts optimistic about a potential approval during Q1. Litecoin’s proof-of-work consensus makes it less likely to be labeled as a security. Analysts are already anticipating up to $580 million in first-year inflows by the Litecoin ETF, opening up an avenue of new opportunities for Litecoin traders. Litecoin is currently trading for $129 after a 5.2% intraday decrease. Litecoin’s trading volume has recorded a 30% decline during the last 24 hours which suggests decreased market participation. Despite the minor pullback, Litecoin is still trading above all of its Exponential Moving Averages on the LTC/USDT daily chart. Since Litecoin’s Momentum Indicator also suggests bullish dominance, Litecoin’s price could rally toward the critical $200 resistance before the end of Q1. Avalanche (AVAX) Struggles Continue As It Rests On Support Avalanche’s price broke below the critical $34 level in early February and the AVAX price entered a downward spiral amid the market-wide bearish sentiment. Before the breakdown, Avalanche’s whale wallets also recorded positive net inflows in January leading to a $600 million capital inflow for Avalanche. Although most of these positions are now underwater, confidence in Avalanche’s long-term prospects is still high as analysts expect a major comeback once the market regains its footing. Avalanche is now trading for $24.60 after an intraday increase of 3.4%. Right now, Avalanche is trading below most of its long-term Exponential Moving Averages on the AVAX/USDT daily chart which means that its price is still in bearish territory. Lunex Network (LNEX) Attracts Capital Inflow with B2B Payment Gateway Lunex Network may not have an ETF of its own, but it has still managed to accumulate more than $7.2 million in capital inflows within a few weeks of its presale launch. Lunex Network’s altcoin is trending in the market for several reasons, but the most standout feature is the interconnected ecosystem that facilitates seamless cross-chain trading. By integrating the latest Web3 technology, Lunex Network is removing the barriers between isolated blockchain networks and bridging them with its disruptive ecosystem.

Cryptocurrency exchange behemoth Bybit suffered a $1.4 billion hack this week, whereas BTC and altcoins remained stagnant despite market advancements. Simultaneously, the meme coin sector panicked amid the emergence of the Argentinian LIBRA token. Here’s a brief collection of some of the top crypto market updates reported by CoinGape Media over the past week. Weekly Crypto Highlights: ByBit Exchange Hacked By N. Korean Group The renowned cryptocurrency exchange Bybit was hacked by ‘The Lazarus Group’ this week, resulting in a massive exploitation of funds. Reportedly, the North Korean criminal organization stole $1.4 billion worth of ETH from the crypto exchange. As a result, the broader crypto market saw a whopping $566 million liquidated in a day as investors started panic selling. In turn, BTC and altcoins reversed recent gains, backtracking to previous lows. BTC price closed the week at around $96K, whereas ETH was near $2,800. XRP & SOL also reversed recent gains, trading in the red this weekend. It’s also worth mentioning that ByBit rolled out a $140 million bounty for cybersecurity experts to recover $1.4 billion stolen in Ethereum. LIBRA Token Panic: What Happened? Meanwhile, Argentinian President Javier Milei endorsed the Solana-based LIBRA meme token this week, which soon rocketed in value. However, the market was taken by storm when insiders cashed out massive amounts amid the rally, urging LIBRA price to crash over 90%. This saga raised rug-pull concerns surrounding the crypto, further bringing heat to its price. However, President Javier Milei ordered a probe into the launch and KIP Protocol, aiming to rectify the error and bolster the token. This saga has emerged as another noteworthy crypto highlight this week, underscoring the market’s risky nature. ETF Filings This Week Simultaneously, a stockpile of ETF advancements was witnessed this week. Canary Capital’s Litecoin ETF emerged on Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), solidifying chances of approval. Further, Grayscale’s XRP ETF entered the U.S. SEC’s review mode. Also, asset manager Franklin Templeton filed an S-1 to launch a spot Solana ETF with the U.S. SEC this week. Mentioned above are the top crypto market highlights for this week, which appear to have substantially impacted investor sentiment.

40716623,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=133082,1740289055,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent: Bitcoin ETFs Bleed for 4th Day – Is Investor Confidence Shaken?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-etf-outflows-investor-confidence/,"Just when Bitcoin seemed to be riding an unstoppable wave of institutional adoption fueled by the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, a concerning trend has emerged. For four consecutive days, these much-hyped investment vehicles have experienced net outflows, signaling a potential shift in investor sentiment. Are we witnessing a temporary profit-taking phase, or is this the beginning of a deeper correction in the crypto market? Let’s delve into the details of these Bitcoin ETF outflows and understand what’s driving this recent market activity. Decoding the Data: Spot Bitcoin ETFs See Continued Outflows According to data from Farside Investors, February 21st marked the fourth straight day of net Bitcoin ETF outflows in the U.S. A total of $62.9 million exited these funds, painting a contrasting picture to the massive inflows witnessed in the weeks following their launch. To understand the nuances of this situation, let’s break down the performance of individual ETFs: Grayscale’s GBTC: The veteran ETF, GBTC, continued to experience significant withdrawals, leading the pack with a substantial $60 million outflow. This ongoing trend is likely attributed to investors capitalizing on arbitrage opportunities and moving away from GBTC’s higher fee structure compared to newer ETFs. Bitwise’s BITB: BITB saw a considerable $16.6 million in net outflows, suggesting that the selling pressure wasn’t limited to GBTC alone. Fidelity’s FBTC: FBTC, another major player, also recorded net outflows of $12.5 million, indicating a broader trend across the established spot Bitcoin ETFs . However, it’s not all gloom and doom. Interestingly, two ETFs bucked the trend, showcasing continued investor interest in specific offerings: BlackRock’s IBIT: BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, a standout performer since launch, continued its inflow streak, attracting a net $21.6 million. This positive momentum suggests strong investor confidence in BlackRock’s brand and ETF management. VanEck’s HODL: VanEck’s HODL also reported inflows, albeit smaller, at $4.7 million. This indicates a niche appeal or potentially different investor base for HODL. Other ETFs: The remaining spot Bitcoin ETFs reported negligible changes, suggesting a mixed bag of investor activity across the board. To get a clearer picture, let’s look at a table summarizing the inflows and outflows on February 21st: ETF Net Flow (USD Million) Grayscale (GBTC) -60.0 Bitwise (BITB) -16.6 Fidelity (FBTC) -12.5 BlackRock (IBIT) +21.6 VanEck (HODL) +4.7 Others Negligible Change Total Net Flow -62.9 Why are Bitcoin ETF Outflows Happening Now? Several factors could be contributing to this recent trend of Bitcoin ETF outflows . It’s crucial to consider these possibilities to understand the bigger picture: GBTC Fee Structure: As mentioned earlier, GBTC’s relatively higher management fee (1.5%) compared to new entrants (many offering fees below 0.3% and even fee waivers initially) makes it less attractive for long-term holders. Investors might be rotating out of GBTC to benefit from lower fees in competing crypto ETFs . Profit Taking: Bitcoin has experienced a significant price surge since the beginning of the year, fueled partly by the ETF hype. Some investors might be taking profits off the table after this substantial run-up, leading to temporary outflows. Market Correction: The broader crypto market, and Bitcoin specifically, often experiences periods of correction after rapid growth. These bitcoin etf outflows could be a symptom of a natural market pullback, as investors reassess their positions and risk appetite. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic uncertainties, inflation concerns, and changes in interest rate expectations can influence investor behavior across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Shifts in macroeconomic sentiment could be triggering some of the outflows. Rotation into Altcoins: With Bitcoin’s price appreciating significantly, some investors might be rotating profits into alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) which often exhibit higher volatility and potentially greater short-term gains during certain market cycles. Impact on Bitcoin Price and Market Sentiment While four days of outflows don’t necessarily signify a long-term bearish trend, they do warrant attention. Sustained Bitcoin ETF outflows could exert downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, especially if the selling momentum intensifies. The market closely monitors ETF flows as indicators of institutional and retail investor sentiment. Negative flows can be interpreted as a lack of confidence or reduced demand, potentially triggering further selling or dampening buying interest. However, it’s important to remember that: IBIT’s Inflows are Positive: BlackRock’s IBIT continuing to attract inflows is a significant positive sign, indicating that institutional demand for Bitcoin exposure through ETFs remains robust. Long-Term Perspective: The spot Bitcoin ETFs are still relatively new. Market dynamics and investor behavior are likely to evolve over time. Short-term fluctuations in flows are expected and don’t necessarily negate the long-term potential of these investment products. Overall ETF Success: Despite recent outflows, the overall launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs has been considered a massive success, bringing billions of dollars into the crypto market and broadening access to Bitcoin for mainstream investors. What’s Next for Spot Bitcoin ETFs? The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether these crypto ETF outflows are a temporary blip or the start of a more sustained trend. Market participants will be closely watching daily flow data, Bitcoin price action, and broader market sentiment. Key questions to consider include: Will GBTC outflows continue to dominate, or will they eventually stabilize? Can IBIT and other ETFs maintain their inflow momentum to offset outflows from other funds? How will Bitcoin’s price react to these ETF flow dynamics? Will macroeconomic events or regulatory developments further influence ETF flows? Final Thoughts: Navigating the Bitcoin ETF Landscape The recent net outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs serve as a reminder of the inherent volatility and dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the initial euphoria surrounding ETF launches may be moderating, it’s crucial to maintain a balanced perspective. The market is still in its early stages of integrating these new investment vehicles. Understanding the nuances of ETF flows, individual ETF performance, and broader market trends is essential for investors navigating this exciting, yet evolving landscape. Don’t panic based on short-term fluctuations; instead, focus on long-term trends and the fundamental drivers of Bitcoin and the crypto market.

40716737,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=133127,1740289341,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Action: OKX Blacklists Bybit Hacker Address in Swift Crypto Security Move,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/okx-blacklist-bybit-hacker-address/,"In a dramatic turn of events highlighting the collaborative spirit within the cryptocurrency industry, OKX exchange has taken decisive action following a recent security incident at Bybit. Hong Fang, CEO of OKX, announced via X (formerly Twitter) that OKX has proactively added the hacker’s address associated with the Bybit breach to its blacklist. This swift response underscores the increasing vigilance and coordinated efforts within the crypto space to combat illicit activities and bolster crypto exchange security . Why is Crypto Exchange Security More Critical Than Ever? The digital asset landscape is rapidly evolving, attracting both legitimate investors and malicious actors. As cryptocurrency adoption grows, so does the incentive for cybercriminals to target exchanges, which often hold vast amounts of digital assets. Crypto exchange security is not just a feature; it’s the bedrock of trust and sustainability in the crypto ecosystem. Recent events have spotlighted vulnerabilities, making robust security measures paramount. Consider these critical aspects: Escalating Cyber Threats: Hacks, phishing attacks, and sophisticated exploits are becoming increasingly common. Exchanges must stay ahead of these threats with cutting-edge security protocols. Regulatory Scrutiny: Global regulators are intensifying their focus on crypto exchanges, demanding higher standards of security and compliance to protect users and maintain market integrity. User Confidence: Breaches erode user trust, which is fundamental for the long-term growth of the crypto market. Demonstrating strong security measures is vital to building and retaining user confidence. Financial and Reputational Risks: A successful hack can lead to significant financial losses, reputational damage, and even regulatory penalties for exchanges. In this context, OKX’s proactive stance in response to the Bybit incident sends a powerful message about the industry’s commitment to safeguarding user assets and maintaining a secure trading environment. The Bybit Hack Incident: A Quick Recap While details surrounding the Bybit hack are still emerging, it’s clear that the incident prompted a swift and coordinated response from within the crypto community. Although specific details of the vulnerability exploited or the extent of the breach haven’t been fully disclosed publicly, the aftermath demonstrates the industry’s capacity to react quickly to mitigate potential damage and prevent further illicit fund movement. The fact that OKX immediately took action to blacklist the identified hacker address indicates a level of inter-exchange communication and cooperation that is crucial in these situations. This kind of rapid response is essential to: Limit Fund Movement: Blacklisting addresses on major exchanges makes it significantly harder for hackers to liquidate or move stolen funds. Aid Investigations: Shared intelligence and blacklisting efforts can assist law enforcement and security firms in tracking down and potentially recovering stolen assets. Deter Future Attacks: A united front against hackers sends a strong deterrent message and encourages exchanges to continuously improve their security measures. OKX’s Decisive Action: Blacklisting the Hacker Address Hong Fang’s announcement on X provided reassurance to the crypto community. OKX blacklist action is a significant step in hindering the hacker’s ability to profit from the Bybit breach. According to the announcement, OKX engineers are actively monitoring the blacklisted address and are prepared to take immediate action should any funds be transferred through their platform. This involves: Real-time Monitoring: Utilizing advanced blockchain analytics tools to track the movement of funds associated with the blacklisted address. Transaction Blocking: Implementing systems to automatically block any transactions originating from or directed to the blacklisted address within the OKX ecosystem. Collaboration with Bybit: Offering IT security expertise and liquidity support to Bybit, showcasing industry solidarity and a commitment to mutual assistance in times of crisis. This proactive approach by OKX not only helps in mitigating the immediate fallout from the Bybit hack but also reinforces the importance of collaborative digital asset protection across the crypto industry. Understanding Hacker Address Blacklisting: How Effective Is It? Blacklisting a hacker address is a critical first step in responding to crypto theft. But how effective is this measure in the grand scheme of things? Let’s examine the pros and cons: Advantages of Blacklisting Limitations of Blacklisting Immediate Disruption: Quickly hinders the hacker’s ability to move funds through compliant exchanges. Circumvention Tactics: Hackers can use decentralized exchanges (DEXs), mixers, or privacy coins to bypass blacklists. Increased Scrutiny: Flags the address across multiple platforms, making it harder for hackers to operate undetected. New Addresses: Hackers can generate new addresses, requiring continuous monitoring and updates to blacklists. Aids Asset Recovery: Provides a trail for law enforcement and asset recovery specialists to track funds. Global Reach Challenges: Blacklists are most effective when implemented globally and consistently across all major exchanges, which can be challenging to coordinate. Deters Future Use: Makes it riskier and more complex for hackers to reuse the same addresses. False Positives: While rare, there’s a risk of mistakenly blacklisting legitimate addresses, requiring careful verification processes. While blacklisting isn’t a silver bullet, it’s an essential component of a comprehensive digital asset protection strategy. Its effectiveness is amplified when combined with other measures like enhanced security protocols, proactive threat intelligence, and international collaboration. The Broader Implications for Crypto Users and the Industry The swift response from OKX and the industry’s collective action following the Bybit hack highlight several important takeaways for crypto users and the broader ecosystem: Exchanges are Taking Security Seriously: The rapid blacklisting and offers of support demonstrate that major exchanges are prioritizing security and are willing to collaborate to protect the industry. Importance of Choosing Secure Exchanges: Users should prioritize exchanges with a proven track record of security, transparency, and proactive incident response. Community Collaboration is Key: The incident underscores the importance of information sharing and cooperation within the crypto community to combat cybercrime effectively.

But what happens when the very institutions designed to safeguard AI are facing the chopping block? News has emerged that the US AI Safety Institute (AISI), a crucial body within the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is facing potentially devastating budget cuts. This development sends shockwaves through the tech community, raising serious questions about the future of AI regulation and safety in the United States. Why the Concern Over US AI Safety Institute Cuts? Imagine building a super-fast car without brakes. That’s essentially what unchecked AI development could become. The AISI was established to be the ‘brake’ – the organization studying potential AI risks and setting crucial safety standards. Created just last year under a previous presidential executive order, its mission is to ensure that AI development proceeds responsibly. However, recent reports paint a grim picture: Massive Layoffs Looming: Axios and Bloomberg reports indicate that NIST, the parent organization of AISI, is planning significant layoffs, potentially affecting up to 500 staffers. These cuts are expected to heavily impact probationary employees, many of whom are likely working within the AISI and Chips for America initiatives. AISI ‘Gutted’: Sources suggest that the US AI Safety Institute is being specifically targeted and could be “gutted” by these layoffs. This means a significant reduction in personnel and resources dedicated to AI safety research and development. Leadership Vacuum: Adding to the turmoil, AISI’s director recently departed in February. This leadership gap, combined with potential staff reductions, creates a perfect storm of instability for the fledgling organization. Policy Reversal: The executive order that initially established AISI was repealed by the current administration, casting further doubt on the institute’s long-term viability and political backing. These potential AI Safety Institute cuts are not just numbers on a spreadsheet; they represent a tangible threat to the nation’s capacity to navigate the complex landscape of AI safety. Expert Voices Raise the Alarm on AI Regulation Impact The news of potential layoffs has been met with widespread criticism from AI safety and policy experts. Jason Green-Lowe, executive director of the Center for AI Policy, voiced serious concerns, stating that these cuts would “severely impact the government’s capacity to research and address critical AI safety concerns.” His sentiment is echoed across the AI safety community. Cutting resources from AISI now is seen as incredibly short-sighted, especially when: AI Risks are Escalating: As AI models become more powerful and integrated into various aspects of life, the potential risks – from bias and misuse to unforeseen consequences – are also growing. Global Race in AI: Nations worldwide are investing heavily in AI research and development. Weakening the US’s AI safety infrastructure could put the country at a disadvantage in the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies. Need for Standards: AISI’s role in developing standards and best practices for AI is crucial for ensuring interoperability, safety, and ethical considerations are built into AI systems from the ground up. Reduced capacity in this area could lead to fragmented and potentially unsafe AI development. The Broader Implications of NIST Layoffs for AI and Tech While the focus is on the US AI Safety Institute , the reported NIST layoffs AI extend beyond just this single organization. NIST plays a vital role in numerous sectors, including technology, manufacturing, and cybersecurity. Cuts of this magnitude could have ripple effects across various critical areas: NIST Area Potential Impact of Cuts AI Safety Research Slowdown in research, reduced capacity to identify and mitigate AI risks. Chips for America Potential delays or scaling back of initiatives to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing. Technology Standards Development Slower development of crucial technology standards, impacting innovation and interoperability. Cybersecurity Weakened cybersecurity research and standards, potentially increasing vulnerability to cyber threats. These potential cuts raise serious questions about the direction of Government AI safety policy and the prioritization of technological safety and regulation in the current political climate. Are we sacrificing long-term safety and responsible innovation for short-term budget savings? Navigating the Uncertain Future of AI Safety The situation surrounding the US AI Safety Institute is fluid and concerning. While the reports of layoffs are still developing, the potential consequences for AI safety and regulation are significant. It underscores the ongoing tension between fostering innovation and ensuring responsible technological development. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, the implications are also relevant. AI is increasingly intertwined with blockchain technology, from enhancing security and efficiency to powering new decentralized applications. A robust and well-regulated AI ecosystem is essential for the continued growth and trust in decentralized technologies. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining the extent of these cuts and their lasting impact on the AI regulation impact and the future of AI safety in the US.

Similarly, the burgeoning field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) faces its own tests of credibility, especially when it comes to AI benchmarks . This week, a public spat erupted, echoing the crypto world’s demand for accountability, as an OpenAI employee publicly questioned the integrity of xAI , Elon Musk’s AI venture, accusing them of presenting potentially misleading benchmarks for their latest model, Grok 3. Was xAI truly showcasing Grok 3’s capabilities accurately, or were these AI benchmarks designed to paint a rosier picture? Let’s delve into this fascinating AI showdown. The Benchmark Battleground: Are Grok 3’s Claims Valid? The heart of the controversy lies in how AI benchmarks are reported, and more crucially, interpreted. xAI , aiming to position Grok 3 as a leading AI, released a blog post highlighting its performance on the AIME 2025 (American Invitational Mathematics Examination) dataset. This dataset, despite some debates about its suitability as a definitive AI benchmark , is widely used to gauge a model’s mathematical reasoning prowess. xAI’s initial graph touted two versions of Grok 3 – Grok 3 Reasoning Beta and Grok 3 mini Reasoning – as outperforming OpenAI’s ‘o3-mini-high’ model on AIME 2025. However, this claim quickly drew fire from OpenAI insiders on X (formerly Twitter). The crux of their argument? The graph conveniently omitted a critical detail: ‘cons@64’ scores for OpenAI’s model. What is ‘cons@64’ and Why Does It Matter for AI Benchmarks? For those unfamiliar, ‘cons@64’ is short for ‘consensus@64.’ Imagine giving an AI model 64 attempts to solve each problem in a benchmark. ‘cons@64’ essentially does this, selecting the most frequently generated answers as the model’s final responses. This method can significantly inflate benchmark scores, making a model appear more capable than it might be in a single-attempt scenario. Think of it like this: @1 (Single Attempt): This reflects the model’s performance on its first try – arguably a more realistic measure of its immediate capability. cons@64 (64 Attempts Consensus): This shows the model’s potential best performance after multiple tries, leveraging statistical probability to arrive at the ‘best’ answer. By not including the ‘cons@64’ score for o3-mini-high, xAI’s graph potentially created a skewed comparison, suggesting Grok 3 surpassed OpenAI’s model when, in reality, the picture might be more nuanced. Grok 3 vs. OpenAI: Decoding the Benchmark Data Looking at the ‘@1’ scores, the initial performance metric, reveals a different story. Grok 3 Reasoning Beta and Grok 3 mini Reasoning actually fall short of o3-mini-high’s score on AIME 2025. Furthermore, Grok 3 Reasoning Beta even slightly lags behind OpenAI’s ‘o1’ model, even when the ‘o1’ model is set to ‘medium’ computing resources. Despite these figures, xAI is actively marketing Grok 3 as the “world’s smartest AI.” This bold claim, juxtaposed with the benchmark data nuances, raises eyebrows and fuels the debate about transparency in AI marketing. Was xAI’s Benchmark Presentation Misleading? Igor Babushkin, a co-founder of xAI , defended the company’s approach on X, arguing that OpenAI has also, in the past, presented misleading benchmarks – albeit in charts comparing their own models. This tit-for-tat highlights a broader issue: the lack of standardized and transparent practices in reporting AI benchmarks across the industry. Adding another layer to the discussion, a neutral observer, Teortaxes (@teortaxesTex on X), compiled a more comprehensive graph. This graph included ‘cons@64’ scores for a wider range of models, providing a more balanced perspective. Hilarious how some people see my plot as attack on OpenAI and others as attack on Grok while in reality it’s DeepSeek propaganda (I actually believe Grok looks good there, and openAI’s TTC chicanery behind o3-mini-*high*-pass@”””1″””” deserves more scrutiny.) pic.twitter.com/3WH8FOUfic — Teortaxes (DeepSeek 推特 铁粉 2023 – ∞) (@teortaxesTex) February 20, 2025 This neutral graph aimed to present a clearer picture, though it inadvertently sparked further debate, showcasing the sensitivity and complexity surrounding AI benchmark comparisons. The Missing Piece: Computational Cost in AI Benchmarks AI researcher Nathan Lambert brought up a crucial, often overlooked, point. He highlighted that the computational and financial resources required for each model to achieve its benchmark scores remain largely undisclosed. This lack of transparency is a significant limitation of current AI benchmarks . A model might achieve a high score, but at what cost? Is it computationally efficient, or does it require massive resources, making it less practical for real-world applications? Consider these questions: Efficiency: How much computing power does each model consume to reach its benchmark score? Cost: What is the financial implication of running each model at scale? Practicality: Is a high-scoring but resource-intensive model truly superior to a slightly lower-scoring, but far more efficient, alternative? Without this crucial context of computational cost, AI benchmarks offer an incomplete picture of a model’s true capabilities and limitations. Navigating the AI Benchmark Maze: What Does This Mean for the Future? The Grok 3 benchmark controversy underscores a critical need for greater transparency and standardization in the AI industry. For users, investors, and the broader public to make informed decisions about AI technologies, we need AI benchmarks that are: Comprehensive: Going beyond single scores to include various performance metrics and contexts. Transparent: Clearly outlining testing methodologies, including details like ‘cons@64’ and computational costs. Standardized: Adhering to industry-wide accepted protocols to ensure fair comparisons across different models and labs. The debate surrounding Grok 3’s misleading benchmarks serves as a potent reminder: scrutiny and critical evaluation are essential, not just in the crypto space, but also in the rapidly evolving world of Artificial Intelligence. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into our lives, demanding clarity and honesty in performance claims is more important than ever. The future of AI hinges not just on technological advancement, but also on building trust and accountability within the industry.

He argued that Argentina is willing to have a mutual free trade deal with the United States, saying its only hindrance is its membership ties to Mercosur, the South American trade bloc. He commented : “I want to take this chance to announce that Argentina wants to be the first country in the world to join this reciprocal accord that the Trump administration proposed on trade matters.” – Javier Milei Argentina’s Milei endorsed Trump’s reciprocal tariff plans Javier Milei met with Donald Trump on the sidelines of the CPAC conference and showed support for the billionaire’s reciprocal tariff plans, which many other countries have seemingly criticized. According to the Argentine government, the two also spoke about the economic measures Milei is advancing in his country and how crucial it is for both countries to collaborate with each other. Moreover, during his speech at the conference, the Argentine president repeatedly endorsed some of Trump’s strategies while bashing what he called “a political class with a God complex.” He also promised to work together with countries that share his vision of freedom and want to root out state bureaucracy, seeing Trump as one of his ideological allies. Aside from Trump, Milei also met with Tesla CEO Elon Musk and even handed him a chainsaw, his government’s symbol of ending state bureaucracy. He also talked with International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva about an IMF loan, which he believes could help grow his country’s economy. Milei is still under investigation for marketing a suspicious meme token While the Argentine leader is seemingly showing more interest in his relationship with the US, he is facing corruption allegations and is currently under investigation for promoting a rather speculative crypto coin. Just after its launch, Milei posted about the LIBRA meme coin on X on the grounds that he wanted to support growing businesses and startups. His post quickly encouraged a price surge for the token, bringing its market valuation to over $4 billion. However, as traders started to withdraw their assets, the token collapsed, with analysts saying the coin showed all the signs of a rug pull. The LIBRA crypto scandal is now locally known as “cryptogate”, with a few influential characters involved, including a 28-year-old American entrepreneur who helped launch First Lady Melania Trump’s meme coin. Meanwhile, the libertarian president distanced himself from the crypto project soon after its dip, even deleting his initial X post, but he did ask the Justice Ministry’s Anti-Corruption Office to investigate the case. Milei and five more others, however, are currently under probe for creating and marketing the token and possible crimes of fraud, abuse of authority, and bribes.

In line with this, he revealed price levels to watch for as DOGE eyes a bullish breakout. Levels To Watch For As Dogecoin Price Confirms Final Retest In a TradingView post, Basic Trading highlighted $0.2, $0.5, and $5 as the levels to watch out for as the Dogecoin price confirms a final retest. This came as the analyst noted that market participants are about to witness a textbook ‘break and retest’ for Dogecoin. Alluding to the monthly chart, the analyst said that DOGE is obviously in an upward trend despite recent corrections. Related Reading: Dogecoin $10 Price Target Back In Play? Here’s What The Charts Say Basic Trading also remarked that the Dogecoin price has seen the expected correction of about 50% following its textbook retest of the previous all-time high about three months ago. The analyst is confident that the foremost meme coin is about to confirm the bullish break and retest, which would eventually lead to a parabolic rally and new highs. He predicts that DOGE will witness significant buy pressure, pushing the Dogecoin price to its current local high of around $0.5. This potential breakout would pave the way for a rally to a new ATH. Basic Trading believes that the foremost meme coin can rally to as high as $5 because of its performance in previous cycles. The analyst noted that the Dogecoin price enjoyed an 8,000% gain in the 2017 bull cycle and a 50,000% in the 2021 cycle. As such, he believes the $5 price level is a conservative target for DOGE in this bull run. Crypto analyst Dima Potts also recently predicted that Dogecoin could reach $10 in this cycle as it is mirroring a similar pattern from the 2017 bull cycle. $3 Remains A Strong Possibility For DOGE In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed how the Dogecoin price could rally to as high as $3 in this market cycle. He noted that the most critical support zone for DOGE is between $0.19 and $0.16. According to him, if this level holds, the $3 target remains a strong possibility for the foremost meme coin. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Knocks Off Second Major Correction, When Will The Recovery To $1 Resume? Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade also provided a bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price. In an X post, he stated that DOGE’s macro chart is showing a similar price pattern. The analyst remarked that if it mirrors the 2017 moves, DOGE could soon experience another massive surge. His accompanying chart showed that the meme coin could reach $1.7 when this massive surge happens. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.25, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM), priced at $0.01 during the first stage, has already sold 94% of its initial allocation, indicating strong investor demand. Early participants have limited time to lock in this entry point before the token price climbs by 50% in the next round. Analysts predict a 600% gain at the planned $0.06 launch valuation, while a longer-term target of $1 in 2025 suggests a 100x opportunity. Established tokens like Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) are charting slower growth, allowing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to stand out as a high-utility alternative poised to disrupt CoinMarketCap’s rankings. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance’s decentralized lending ecosystem combines peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer models, letting lenders earn passive income through liquidity pools while borrowers can post crypto collateral without liquidating their assets. This approach addresses prevalent challenges in the DeFi space, attracting attention from both individual and institutional investors. Phase 1 of the presale has already surpassed $1.03 million, with fewer than 6% of tokens remaining at $0.01. Early adopters can secure a guaranteed 6x return when MUTM debuts at $0.06. Beyond its listing, experts anticipate a rise toward $1 by 2025, reflecting a 100x multiple, underpinned by Mutuum’s fee framework: 20% of platform revenue automatically buys back MUTM on the open market, cultivating persistent demand and reinforcing the token’s price. Mutuum Finance isn’t reliant on hype. Audits for the project’s smart contracts are already complete, and a $100,000 giveaway will reward early supporters and boost community involvement. An upcoming stablecoin, anchored by on-chain reserves, adds stability to the ecosystem, facilitating smoother lending transactions. With exchange listings arranged to coincide with the beta platform release, MUTM avoids the “vaporware” stigma that often plagues other presale tokens. Investors recognize the potential and are quickly purchasing tokens, aware that each presale phase narrows profit margins for later entrants. The $0.01 price in Phase 1 represents the best chance to maximize returns before incremental price increases lead to a $0.06 launch valuation. For instance, a $1,500 investment now could net $9,000 at launch, and if MUTM reaches $1, that same stake might be worth $150,000. This is a rare risk-reward dynamic in today’s crypto market. Mounting Competition for ADA and XRP As Mutuum Finance captures more market share, it diverts capital away from legacy tokens like Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP). Combining straightforward tokenomics, real-world use cases, and proactive buyback mechanisms, MUTM looks set to challenge mainstream altcoins in CoinMarketCap’s top 10. While ADA and XRP cope with incremental obstacles, Mutuum Finance’s presale achievements and expansive growth plans suggest a reshuffling of market rankings could be imminent. With under 6% of Phase 1 tokens remaining at $0.01—and a 50% price increase looming in Phase 2—waiting may mean missing the most favorable entry point. Join the more than 2,000 current investors who are positioning themselves for major gains in 2025. Visit Mutuum Finance’s official website to secure MUTM tokens now, before the chance to invest at $0.01 disappears.

40717452,https://coinpedia.org/?p=423718,1740290605,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Solana Price Prediction After Libra Scandal; New Token Shines,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/solana-price-prediction-after-libra-scandal-new-token-shines/,"The post Solana Price Prediction After Libra Scandal; New Token Shines appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Solana price has crashed this week and is on the verge of more downside as concerns about meme coins in the ecosystem jumps. The SOL token plunged to $160 this week, and is about to form the highly-risky death cross chart pattern on the daily chart. So, what next for Solana as market experts move to Minotaurus (MTAUR) ? Solana price forecast Solana, one of the biggest players in the crypto industry, has crashed into a bear market, falling from near $300 to $173. This coin has more downside as it is about to form a death cross pattern, which happens when the 200-day and 50-day moving averages flip each other. Solana also formed a double-top chart pattern at $264, and whose neckline was at $170. A double-top is one of the most bearish patterns in technical analysis. It has also moved below the Ichimoku cloud indicator. Additionally, Solana fell below the crucial ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since August 5 last year. Moving below that level is a sign that market participants expect it to crash much further in the next few months. Therefore, there is a likelihood that Solana price will drop to $110 in this bear market cycle. Such a crash would imply a 37% plunge from the current level. On the other hand, a move above the resistance level at $203, the 50-day moving average, will invalidate the bearish outlook. Why SOL price is imploding There are two main reasons why the Solana price is crashing. First, the drop happened because of the ongoing plunge of other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has dropped from $109,300 to $95,000, while most tokens like Cardano and Tron are in a steep bear market. Second, Solana has crashed because of the prevalence of meme coins in its ecosystem. Most of the recently launched meme coins have all plunged, costing many participants billions and making insiders millions. The best examples of this are Official Trump and Libra, which was promoted by Javier Milei. All this has led to concerns that Solana is a scam blockchain. It has also led to a sharp plunge of the volume handled by its DEX protocols. Experts flock to Minotaurus Crypto experts, fearful of the ongoing woes on Solana, have flocked to Minotaurus, an upcoming player in the gaming industry. Minotarus developers are creating a game that will be available on Android and iOS. It will be a simple-to-play game that millions of users are expected to enjoy. Minotaurus has already crossed the 1.75 million USDT mark in presale token sales in the past few weeks, and the momentum is gaining steam. This trajectory is happening because many of the participants know its potential. For one, it is in the blockchain and leisure gaming industry that has a total addressable market or TAM of over $50 billion.Participants are also buying the MTAUR token because of the promising upward path during presale. The MTAUR token is now priced at 0.00010518, much lower than the eventual listing price of 0.000200. Users also stand a chance to win big through the 100,000 USDT giveaway. So, hurry up and buy the Minotaurus token here .",Sponsored,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-23 06:03:25

While COLD is gaining traction in niche sectors, Lightchain AI is drawing massive investor interest with its blockchain and AI integration, offering long-term growth potential. The Lightchain AI Presale has already raised over $15.6 million at a presale price of $0.006, signaling strong confidence in its future. As investors seek the next big opportunity, Lightchain AI’s innovative approach could position it as a top-performing asset in the next major bull run. COLD- What Analysts Are Saying About its Potential Americold Realty Trust Inc. (NYSE; COLD) is a leading real estate investment trust specializing in temperature-controlled warehouses. Analysts currently maintain a cautiously optimistic outlook on the company’s potential. According to The Wall Street Journal, the consensus rating for COLD is Overweight, with an average price target of $28.00. TipRanks reports a similar sentiment, noting 14 Buy ratings and 7 Hold ratings in the past month. Factors contributing to this positive sentiment include Americold’s strategic acquisitions and its pivotal role in the global cold storage supply chain. However, analysts also caution about potential risks such as market volatility and operational challenges. Investors are advised to monitor these dynamics closely when considering COLD as a potential investment. Lightchain AI- What Sets it Apart for 1000X Gains Lightchain AI is emerging as a top contender for exponential growth, with Dynamic Resource Allocation and low latency setting it apart from traditional blockchain projects. Dynamic Resource Allocation optimizes computational power by distributing AI workloads across network nodes based on their processing capacity.

Additionally, low latency is a key advantage of Lightchain AI, allowing real-time AI execution without delays. Its optimized architecture ensures near-instant transaction verification and AI model deployment, making it suitable for high-speed decentralized applications. These innovations position Lightchain AI as a groundbreaking project with the potential for massive 1000X gains. Invest in Lightchain AI – Leading Future of AI and Blockchain As the world becomes increasingly reliant on AI and blockchain technologies, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a disruptive force in both industries. Its innovative approach and strong investor confidence make it an attractive investment for long-term growth potential.

40718660,https://timestabloid.com/?p=58258,1740291352,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple Price Forecast: Why XRP Holders Are Rotating to 2025’s Best Crypto Presale As 50% Bonus Goes Live,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-price-forecast-why-xrp-holders-are-rotating-to-2025s-best/,"Ripple (XRP) momentum has cooled considerably in recent weeks, leading many holders to question what the future might hold. A growing number have shifted their focus to Rollblock (RBLK), the new Web3 gaming platform poised for explosive growth this year. With a recent 600% spike in new users, analysts predict a possible 50x rally for RBLK this year, making it one of the most compelling crypto opportunities of 2025. Rollblock (RBLK) Doubles Down With Startling 50% Token Bonus While many crypto gaming projects fail to gain a foothold in the industry, Rollblock ( RBLK ) is proving its staying power with its rapidly growing community. December marked a breakthrough for Rollblock with a staggering 600% increase in new gamers joining the platform and a total of $1.75 million in wagered bids being placed . Clearly, the Rollblock mission to bring transparency back to gaming is paying off and attracting huge numbers each day. The platform offers over 7,000 games, all powered by the latest AI technology and uniting the community with live dealer modes and PVP settings. The newly launched sports prediction league has also proven exceptionally popular with armchair sports pundits. Rollblock now supports fiat deposits via Apple Pay, Google Pay and Mastercard, improving access for users around the world. Every transaction is securely recorded onto the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring full transparency and allowing gamers to verify every payout on chain. Rollblock’s deflationary revenue-sharing model marks the token out from the majority of gaming cash grabs. The platform allocates up to 30% of its revenue to buy back RBLK, with 60% of these tokens permanently burned and 40% distributed to stakers who can earn up to 30% APY. Its popular presale has already raised more than $10.5 million in investor inflows and is rapidly selling out of stage 10 tokens at $0.06. Investors can also capitalize on a phenomenal 50% limited-time bonus for all RBLK purchases this week, making now the perfect time to build a position. Ripple (XRP): Regulatory Battles Amid ETF Approvals Ripple (XRP) continues to face uncertainty due to its ongoing legal battle with the SEC. Despite recent court rulings favoring Ripple, sentiment has remained mixed and trading volumes have fallen sharply in recent weeks. Ripple is currently trading around $2.54 after losing 7% this week. The monthly time frame looks even more severe, with a 20% drawdown in the last 30 days. On the adoption front, the launch of Hashdex’s Ripple spot ETF in Brazil is a landmark step for Ripple. This will open up walls of institutional capital to the Ripple ecosystem and makes the case for a similar US-based fund much more likely this year. Analysts are confident that Ripple could surge past $5 this year if adoption continues at current rates. Stage 10 RBLK Tokens Are Selling Fast – Don’t Miss Out While Ripple continues to navigate choppy trading waters, Rollblock ($RBLK) presents a far more attractive investment opportunity. As it races through its final presale stages, Rollblock is poised for massive growth, and investors should act quickly before the next price increase.

In a post , he stated, “XRP is quietly loading up for the next push to $7.20. Many non-believers have been shaken out. We hold. And we will rise together.” His statement reflects the confidence of many long-term investors despite the market’s volatility. Many prominent figures have reiterated the importance of holding XRP, as they expect its price to shake out many weak retail investors, before reaching its true potential. $XRP is quietly loading up for the next push to $7.20 Many non believers have been shaken out. We hold. And we will rise together — Crypto Bitlord (@crypto_bitlord7) February 22, 2025 The digital asset’s rise over the past few months has made it more difficult to become a top holder, and it will only get worse as its price increases. XRP Army Weighs In Following this post, the XRP community responded with mixed reactions. Some traders agreed with Crypto Bitlord’s projection, while others questioned the rationale behind the specific $7.20 target. One user supported the sentiment, replying , “Yes my man, soon.” Others shared similar enthusiasm, with one commenter stating , “In $XRP we believe” and another writing , “Be patient and watch it rise.” Other users proposed alternative price levels. one said , “Make it $10,” while another suggested it could reach $25, $50, and eventually $150. More extreme projections also surfaced, with one commenter writing , “$XRP to $589,” reflecting the high expectations among investors. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Despite the optimism, some community members challenged the prediction. One user questioned the $7.20 target, calling Crypto Bitlord out for not explaining the reasoning behind the target. Notably, other analysts have set targets around $8 for XRP, and as one commenter pointed out , the $7.20 target is most likely derived from key levels on the XRP chart, even though Crypto Bitlord did not share that chart. Can XRP Reach This Target? Various factors drive speculation about XRP’s price increase. Some investors believe regulatory clarity will be a key catalyst, as recent reports suggest that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will soon dismiss its lawsuit against Ripple. The regulator has already agreed to dismiss the Coinbase lawsuit and is awaiting approval from its commissioners. This development, combined with the recent shift in the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation, has convinced many experts that the end of the Ripple lawsuit is around the corner. This dismissal could push XRP toward $7.2 and potentially beyond. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Among them, Skyren DAO stands out as the first airdrop collection DAO, designed to maximize rewards by strategically farming airdrops from emerging projects. With AI-driven governance, high-yield staking, and a focus on delivering value across multiple ecosystems, Skyren is gaining strong momentum. Its innovative approach ensures Bitcoin and Qubetics holders benefit from new opportunities, making it a standout project in the 2025 DeFi landscape. How Skyren is Delivering Value to Bitcoin and Qubetics Holders Airdrops have long been a powerful tool in the crypto space, rewarding early adopters and fostering community growth. However, Skyren’s Token Surge is taking this concept to the next level by specifically targeting presale participants from select projects, including Bitcoin and Qubetics holders. Token Surge: A New Standard in Airdrops Unlike traditional airdrops that randomly distribute tokens, Skyren’s Token Surge is designed to ensure maximum engagement and value. Here’s why it stands out: Exclusive Eligibility – Only users who participated in specific projects, including Bitcoin and Qubetics, are eligible. Guaranteed Rewards – Each qualifying participant receives 500 SKYRN tokens, giving them access to Skyren’s high-yield staking and governance ecosystem. Extended Claim Period – Holders have until June 2025 to claim their tokens, allowing flexibility in participation. Secure Verification – The airdrop process ensures security by requiring only public blockchain data and a simple verification step. For Bitcoin holders, this means exposure to one of the most promising DeFi projects without needing to buy additional tokens. Qubetics holders, on the other hand, can leverage their participation to access Skyren’s superior earning mechanisms, setting Skyren apart from the general Web3 aggregated ecosystems like Qubetics. By offering targeted airdrops, Skyren attracts engaged and knowledgeable investors, reinforcing its goal of building a thriving DeFi ecosystem. Skyren: A DeFi Innovation with Unmatched Potential Beyond the Token Surge program, Skyren is setting a new industry standard through its unique approach to airdrop farming, AI-powered governance, and multi-ecosystem staking rewards.

AI-Driven Governance & Decentralization One of Skyren’s standout features is its AI-powered governance system, which enhances decision-making within the DAO. Instead of relying on centralized entities, Skyren’s AI helps optimize airdrop collection strategies, staking rewards, and liquidity allocation, ensuring that SKYRN holders always receive the best possible returns. 3. High-Yield Staking & Reward Maximization Unlike typical staking models, Skyren offers multi-layered staking opportunities. By staking SKYRN tokens, holders not only earn rewards from standard DeFi mechanisms like lending and liquidity pools but also benefit from airdrops collected from dozens of upcoming projects. 4. A Thriving Ecosystem with a Massive ROI Potential With Phase 2 of the presale now live, Skyren is positioned for explosive growth. Here’s why early investors are flocking to the project: Current Presale Price: $0.03 (Next Phase: $0.04) Launch Price: $0.15 Total Tokens: 11,000,000 SKYRN Projected ROI: 500% As more investors recognize Skyren’s value proposition, demand for SKYRN tokens is expected to skyrocket, further boosting its price potential. Why Crypto Experts Are Calling Skyren a Game-Changer Skyren’s disruptive approach to DeFi has earned it widespread recognition. From top influencers to DeFi analysts, the project is being hailed as one of the most innovative crypto ventures of 2025. Crypto Volt , a well-known DeFi YouTuber, recently called Skyren a “Game Changer”. Other influencers have praised Skyren’s airdrops strategy, high-yield staking, and AI-driven governance. With multiple audits confirming its security, Skyren has earned the trust of crypto investors and analysts alike. In addition, the Skyren DAO Telegram group is your space to interact with the community, receive direct help from the team, and access updates as they happen Conclusion Skyren isn’t just another DeFi project—it’s a game-changing ecosystem that maximizes investor returns through strategic airdrop farming, AI governance, and high-yield staking. For Bitcoin and Qubetics holders, its Token Surge program offers exposure to this innovative model without additional investment. With a presale underway, early adopters can secure SKYRN tokens at a discount before its $0.15 launch.

While they offer massive hype-driven gains, Avalanche, Sui, and 1Fuel (OFT) provide real utility and long-term potential. With AI-driven trading and cross-chain functionality, 1Fuel has already raised over $2.3 million in its ICO. Sui (SUI) gains momentum as DeFi expansion accelerates Despite dropping to $3.42, Sui (SUI) remains a key player in blockchain innovation, with rapid network development and growing DeFi integration. The recent native USDC support and Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol have strengthened its role in fast, efficient transactions, attracting both traders and developers looking for scalable blockchain solutions. Beyond short-term price action, SUI’s object-centric data model and Move programming language make it a top choice for next-generation dApps. With a 96 percent year-to-date gain, institutional interest is rising, fueled by strong fundamentals and increasing adoption. As SUI expands its DeFi ecosystem, its impact on Web3 payments and blockchain interoperability is becoming even clearer. Analysts predict Sui could reach $5 soon as demand for high-performance, cross-chain blockchain solutions continues to grow. Thus, Sui is one of the most promising assets in the market. Avalanche (AVAX) gains momentum as adoption grows Avalanche (AVAX) is displaying bearish momentum despite dipping to $25 with a 2% loss on the daily charts. Avalanche’s latest network upgrade has cut transaction fees by 75%, making it a more scalable and low-cost Layer 1 blockchain. This improvement is drawing in brand new interest from developers searching for a performant and affordable blockchain system. Beyond technical upgrades, Avalanche is looking toward real-world applications. A partnership with Karnataka’s Seva Sindhu platform, which is now running, adds blockchain-powered digital services to huge numbers of users. This expanding adoption positions Avalanche as a pioneer in real-world blockchain integration. However, analysts remain optimistic, with several setting a $53 price target for Avalanche as institutional and developer interest rises. With low-cost transactions and increasing Web3 adoption, Avalanche seeks to maintain its long-term development and become a vital participant in the blockchain community. 1Fuel: The high-potential crypto bridging decentralized trading and real-world finance 1Fuel enables cross-chain decentralized trading where users swap assets across several blockchains. This particular innovation offers much more liquidity, particularly for lesser-known coins, thus boosting trading and market activity. Beyond cross-chain trading, 1Fuel integrates AI-powered tools and a P2P exchange, making it easier to trade small-cap assets directly with preferred parties. Unlike platforms that restrict users to a single ecosystem, 1Fuel expands market access across multiple blockchains, increasing flexibility and efficiency. Further expanding real-world use cases, 1Fuel is launching a crypto wallet and debit card. These allow users to spend digital assets anywhere Visa and Mastercard are accepted. This bridges the gap between crypto and traditional finance, boosting liquidity and accessibility. With just 24 hours left to accumulate 1Fuel, investors can still take advantage of the 40% bonus before the presale closes. Analysts predict a 100x rally, making this a prime opportunity before the price surge. If the presale surpasses $3 million, 1Fuel’s Beta Wallet launch could go live, offering eligible investors even bigger rewards. With over $2.3 million already raised, 1Fuel is providing early investors with an ideal entry point. Priced at just $0.018 per token, it stands out as one of the market’s most affordable, high-potential investments. As the best meme coin of 2025 gains momentum, 1Fuel is proving to be a serious contender for long-term growth.

However, this article will look into Berachain, XRP, and ChowWow tokens, which are making waves in the market and are backed for massive returns in 2025. Although in the early stage of the presale, ChowWow is showing signs similar to the early stage of Pepe, which has triggered positive predictions. Given the rising adoption, the CHOW meme coin is expected to rise as high as 12,000% within weeks of launch, similar to that of Dogwifhat in 2024. Can Berachain Coin Hit $20 Soon? Berachain (BERA) has continued to witness positive price action in recent weeks. According to Defillama , the Berachain ecosystem total value locked (TVL) has surpassed $3B, showcasing the growing adoption of the network. Regarding market performance, the Berachain price soared by 47% in the past week, as per CoinMarketCap , with over 700% gains since the mainnet launch on February 6th. Top crypto analyst Dr. Ritika Singhal is bullish about the Berachain crypto. While analyzing the Berachain price chart on X, Singhal thinks that as long as the Bitcoin price is stable, the BERA price will rise towards the target of $6.50, $7.30, and $8.20. Stats from Emperor Osmo show that the inflow into the Berachain network surpassed that of HYPE and Arbitrum in the past week, showcasing its rising adoption. Backed by its Proof of Liquidity (PoL) mechanism, which allows users to stake and provide liquidity simultaneously for rewards, the ecosystem is developing at a faster pace, which will trigger massive interest in the BERA coin. In their Berachain price prediction for the short term, experts at Coincodex forecast a rise to $27.44. Experts Bullish on XRP’s Price Outlook in the Coming Months Having held the $3.84 all-time high for the past 7 years, the XRP price might break the record in the coming weeks. CoinMarketCap data shows that XRP coin is still among the cryptos trading above the early November lows when the Q4 market rally started. Although the Ripple price has dipped by 17% in the past month, the YTD price metrics show over 390% growth. In a tweet on X, Steph is Crypto claims that XRP will produce crypto millionaires in the year. In a similar view, popular analyst Crypto Beast thinks that the XRP coin price will hit $10 soon as the news of the ETF filing continues to make waves in the market. However, the technical analysis of the past weeks doesn’t look good, with key market indicators dipping. While studying the XRP price chart, Ali Martinez claims that the TD sequential indicator flashed a buy signal in the hourly candlestick barely a few days after the analyst projected a rise to $4 in a similar tweet . Given its rising adoption, XRP is one of the altcoins to buy and HODL. ChowWow: The New Memecoin Star Set to Transform the Solana Blockchain With the Solana network facing issues of rug pool, ChowWow is on a mission to transform the chain by launching a meme coin backed by two core features — play to earn and stake to earn. In the P2E platform, users will engage in a gaming adventure to garner points that are converted into real-world assets. The staking program gives non-gamers the opportunity to stake their tokens and earn as much as 15% in APY rewards, which will be paid monthly. Unlike other meme coins like Dogecoin with no fixed supply, ChowWow has a strict supply of 888.77 million, of which 5% is allocated for community activities and airdrops on launch. Also, 50% is earmarked for presale. As a project inspired by the Chinese Chow Chow dog breed, which is believed to extol luck and fortune, ChowWow is on a mission to promote financial freedom for the masses. Outside of the two main features, users can earn by engaging in the ongoing ChowWow meme competition with a $1000 USDT price pool. There is also an ongoing bonus offer for investors who buy more than $250 CHOW tokens. That means the more tokens you buy, the higher the bonus offer. Given that CHOW is currently being sold for just $0.008, investors can accumulate the meme coin without breaking the bank. Features like the deflationary mechanism, which ensures regular token burn and buyback, will likely drive the price up. As such, CHOW is one of the best meme coins to watch out for in 2025. What are the Top Cryptos for Explosive Growth in 2025? Although the crypto market is highly volatile, Berachain and XRP are good cryptos to buy for short and long-term gains. As for ChowWow, its growing community will lead to more investor inflow, which will trigger buying pressure. With its deflationary mechanism, the upcoming scarcity will boost the price. Its gaming and staking models are also appealing and could drive more users to the platform. Overall, it is one of the meme coins to watch in 2025.

Zhao explained that he would not be keeping any of the funds for himself, and asked for suggestions on how best to allocate them. “I will not keep any tokens for myself.

Mike Novogratz, a billionaire investor and finance expert, recently discussed why the asset has maintained relevance, pointing to a crucial factor many overlook. While Novogratz was once skeptical about XRP’s long-term prospects, he has since revised his stance. He admitted that he was “ dead wrong ” about the digital asset, and now believes that the strength of its community, rather than just its technology or market position, has been the driving force behind its endurance. His latest remarks came during an episode of the Galaxy Brains podcast, where he analyzed how different cryptocurrencies have performed and why some have retained value better than others. Ethereum’s Struggles and the Role of Community During the discussion, host Alex Thorn brought up Ethereum’s weakening position against Bitcoin. He noted that Ethereum had lost 75% of its value relative to Bitcoin since the Merge and an additional 50% since Ethereum ETFs were announced in mid-2024 . This led to the question of when Ethereum’s downward trend might reverse. Novogratz responded by contrasting Bitcoin and Ethereum. He argued that Bitcoin’s strength lies in its straightforward identity as digital gold, a narrative that has remained consistent over time. Its value, he explained, is largely based on collective belief rather than just technological advancements. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ethereum, on the other hand, presents a more complex case. While it functions as a decentralized trust layer, its value proposition has been challenged by the rising number of alternative blockchain platforms. Novogratz pointed out that the constant influx of new tokens has made it harder for Ethereum and many other altcoins to build and sustain strong communities. In his view, the oversaturation of the market has diluted the attention and support that individual projects receive. Why XRP Has Maintained Relevance XRP and Cardano have remained relevant due to their early entry into the crypto space, allowing them to build strong, loyal communities before the market became crowded. Novogratz, who once doubted XRP’s longevity due to Ripple’s control over its supply, has now acknowledged the power of its dedicated supporters . He emphasized that community engagement is a key factor in a cryptocurrency’s success, noting that he had underestimated XRP’s resilience and its late 2024 price surge following Trump’s election.

40719029,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=133132,1740293492,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Exposed: Lazarus Group’s Shocking $1.46B Ethereum Laundering After Bybit Hack,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/lazarus-group-ethereum-bybit-hack/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The plot thickens in the world of digital assets as a staggering $1.46 billion Ethereum heist linked to the Bybit exchange is now under the spotlight. Blockchain sleuth ZachXBT, the very person who initially raised alarms about the Bybit incident, has dropped another bombshell: the infamous Lazarus Group is allegedly behind a massive money laundering operation, moving a mountain of stolen Ethereum . Let’s dive deep into this unfolding saga and unpack what it means for the crypto sphere. Unveiling the Ethereum Laundering Operation: How Did It Unfold? According to a tweet by Wu Blockchain, citing ZachXBT’s findings, the Lazarus Group, a notorious cybercriminal syndicate with ties to North Korea, didn’t just vanish with the Ethereum pilfered from Bybit. Instead, they appear to have embarked on a sophisticated laundering mission. Here’s a breakdown of the alleged money trail: Initial Transfer: A whopping 5,000 ETH, part of the massive $1.46 billion haul, was moved to a fresh, previously inactive address. This is a classic tactic to obscure the origin of funds. Mixer Magic: The 5,000 ETH then entered eXch, a cryptocurrency mixer. Mixers are designed to obfuscate the transaction history of cryptocurrencies, making it incredibly difficult to trace the funds back to their source. Think of it as a digital washing machine for crypto. Bridging to Bitcoin: From the mixer, the laundered Ethereum was bridged to Bitcoin (BTC) using Chainflip. This cross-chain transfer further complicates tracking, as it moves the assets to a different blockchain altogether. This intricate process showcases the Lazarus Group’s expertise in not just hacking, but also in the art of financial subterfuge within the crypto ecosystem. But why is this significant, and what does it mean for Bybit and the wider crypto world? Why is the Bybit Hack and Ethereum Laundering a Big Deal? The scale of the Bybit hack is truly colossal. Losing $1.46 billion in Ethereum is not a minor security breach; it’s a catastrophic event for any exchange. Here’s why this incident and the subsequent laundering attempts are causing ripples across the crypto community: Trust Erosion: Hacks of this magnitude shake user confidence in cryptocurrency exchanges. If a platform like Bybit, presumably with robust security measures, can fall victim to such an attack, it raises serious questions about the security of other exchanges and the safety of user funds. Regulatory Scrutiny: Incidents like these often trigger increased regulatory pressure on the crypto industry. Governments and financial watchdogs are already concerned about illicit activities in crypto, and a billion-dollar hack will only intensify calls for stricter regulations and oversight. Market Impact: While the immediate market impact might be diluted due to the overall size of the crypto market, such large-scale thefts can contribute to market volatility and negative sentiment, especially if the laundered funds are eventually dumped onto exchanges. Blockchain Security Concerns: It highlights the ongoing battle between blockchain security experts and sophisticated cybercriminals. Despite the transparency of blockchain, mixers and cross-chain bridges are becoming tools to bypass traceability, posing a significant challenge to law enforcement and asset recovery efforts. Lazarus Group: Who Are These Master Crypto Launderers? The mention of the Lazarus Group sends shivers down the spine of cybersecurity professionals. This isn’t just any hacking group; they are a highly sophisticated, state-sponsored cybercriminal organization believed to be linked to North Korea. They are notorious for: State Sponsorship: Allegedly backed by the North Korean government, they operate with significant resources and a level of sophistication rarely seen in typical cybercrime. Financial Motivation: A primary goal is to generate revenue for the North Korean regime, which faces severe economic sanctions. Crypto theft has become a lucrative avenue for them to circumvent these sanctions. Advanced Techniques: They employ cutting-edge hacking tools and techniques, constantly evolving their methods to stay ahead of security measures. Their involvement in the Ethereum laundering operation further demonstrates their adaptability and skill in navigating the complexities of blockchain technology. Prolific Track Record: Lazarus Group has been linked to numerous high-profile cyberattacks and crypto heists over the years, establishing a fearsome reputation in the cybersecurity world. Actionable Insights: What Can We Learn and Do? The Bybit hack and subsequent Ethereum laundering attempt offer crucial lessons and call for proactive measures from various stakeholders: Enhanced Exchange Security: Cryptocurrency exchanges must continuously upgrade their security infrastructure, focusing on robust cold wallet protection, multi-signature schemes, and proactive threat intelligence to defend against advanced persistent threats like Lazarus Group. Regular security audits and penetration testing are no longer optional but essential. Improved On-Chain Analytics: Blockchain analysis firms and tools need to become even more sophisticated to track and deanonymize laundered funds effectively, especially as criminals utilize mixers and cross-chain bridges. Collaboration between exchanges, security firms, and law enforcement is paramount. User Awareness and Education: Crypto users must be educated about the risks associated with exchanges and the importance of diversification. While this hack targeted Bybit’s cold wallet, users should still practice good security hygiene, such as using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and being wary of phishing attempts. Regulatory Collaboration: Global regulatory bodies need to work together to establish clear frameworks for cryptocurrency security and anti-money laundering (AML). International cooperation is crucial to track down and prosecute cybercriminals operating across borders. The Future of Crypto Security: A Constant Arms Race? The Lazarus Group’s alleged involvement in the Bybit hack and Ethereum laundering underscores a sobering reality: the fight for cryptocurrency security is an ongoing arms race. As blockchain technology evolves and becomes more mainstream, so too do the tactics of cybercriminals. This incident serves as a stark reminder that: Complacency is dangerous: No cryptocurrency exchange, no matter how large or reputable, is immune to attacks. Continuous vigilance and proactive security measures are non-negotiable. Innovation in security is key: The crypto industry must constantly innovate in security technologies and methodologies to stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated threats. This includes exploring advanced cryptography, AI-powered threat detection, and decentralized security solutions. Community collaboration is vital: Sharing threat intelligence, best practices, and incident response strategies across the crypto community is crucial to collectively strengthen the ecosystem’s defenses. The Ethereum stolen from Bybit and the Lazarus Group’s alleged laundering efforts represent a significant challenge to the crypto world. It’s a call to action for exchanges, security experts, regulators, and users alike to double down on security, vigilance, and collaboration to safeguard the future of decentralized finance.

This development has prompted speculation within the XRP community about the potential impact on Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC, which is currently in the appeals process. As discussions intensified, former SEC Director John Reed Stark suggested that the agency might follow a similar course of action in Ripple’s case. Stark predicted that the SEC’s aggressive enforcement tactics would soon end , raising hopes that the long-standing legal dispute could be the next to go. Potential Resolution Timeline for Ripple v. SEC Attorney Jeremy Hogan, a well-known attorney and crypto enthusiast who has closely followed the lawsuit, offered his perspective on when a resolution might occur. Hogan had previously predicted that the legal battle would end in April or May but recently suggested it could happen sooner. Responding to a query on the timeline for dismissal, Hogan stated, “An earlier resolution is definitely in play, but I’m still thinking it might be May. May or the first half of April. Just a hunch.” An earlier resolution is definitely in play, but I'm still thinking it might be May. May or the first half of April. Just a hunch. — Jeremy Hogan (@attorneyjeremy1) February 22, 2025 We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 There is also a crucial deadline on April 16 for Ripple to file its opening brief in its cross-appeal against the SEC. The regulator may dismiss the appeal or agree with Ripple before this date to prevent the legal battle from proceeding. However, a dismissal may not be as straightforward as the Coinbase lawsuit. Legal Complexities Surrounding Ripple’s Case While some believe the SEC could choose to dismiss its appeal against Ripple in light of its decision on Coinbase, others argue that the cases are not directly comparable. Fox Business correspondent Eleanor Terrett highlighted the unique procedural challenges in Ripple’s case. Terrett pointed to the existing order from Judge Analisa Torres, which requires Ripple to pay a $125 million penalty . Terrett shared a portion of the final judgment stating that the court will retain jurisdiction over the case until August 7, 2025, ensuring that the terms of the order are followed. Given this, Terrett suggested that even if the SEC were to drop its appeal, the agency would need to address the district court’s penalty ruling. This could involve negotiating a reduction or requesting its removal, a process that would require the judge’s approval.

Crypto influencer XRP Captain (@UniverseTwenty) highlighted a transaction involving the transfer of 40 million XRP from an unidentified wallet to Bybit. JUST IN 40 Million #XRP Transferred From Unknown Wallet To #Bybit Anonymous Whale Just Gave Loan To Bybit ( #XRP Liquidity ) pic.twitter.com/sP7lCzx5k6 — XRP CAPTAIN (@UniverseTwenty) February 21, 2025 This development follows a recent hack that resulted in the loss of $1.46 billion in digital assets from Bybit, marking one of the largest cryptocurrency thefts. Bybit’s Security Breach On February 21, 2025, Bybit experienced a sophisticated cyberattack leading to the theft of over 400,000 Ethereum tokens, valued at approximately $1.46 billion. This attack came shortly after ByBit took a major initiative by making its liquidation data accessible to the public . The attackers manipulated the smart contract interface, gaining control of one of Bybit’s cold wallets and transferring its contents to an unknown address. Despite the magnitude of the theft, Bybit’s CEO, Ben Zhou, assured users that the exchange remains solvent and that all client assets are fully backed. He emphasized that unaffected wallets and withdrawal processes continue to operate normally. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The 40 Million XRP Transaction In the aftermath of the breach, a notable transaction was observed: 40 million XRP tokens were transferred from an unknown wallet to Bybit. While ByBit assured clients everything was fine, XRP Captain shared a screenshot of a report from Watcher Guru revealing that the exchange is accepting loans to cover withdrawals. While the purpose of this substantial transfer has not been officially disclosed, speculation within the community suggests that this influx of XRP is a loan to bolster Bybit’s liquidity following the recent security incident. Some community members took this further, with one commenter suggesting that this transfer was a loan from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. Another commenter claimed that Garlinghouse funded the $TRUMP token with $60 million, and argued that it was logical for him to support ByBit in this situation. Bybit’s Response and Recovery Efforts In response to the security breach, Bybit has initiated measures to recover the stolen assets and enhance its security framework. The exchange has announced a bounty program, pledging 10% of any recovered funds—potentially up to $140 million—to cybersecurity experts and blockchain analysts who assist in tracking and retrieving the stolen assets. While there has been no confirmation that the $40 million transfer was a loan, the transaction has drawn significant attention within the cryptocurrency community.

Already selling at $0.005, this rising star is fueling speculation about whether it could dominate markets within months. The recent surge in meme coins, coupled with bullish tron news and shifting Solana price trends, suggests SHIBI might be the next big thing. Its presale momentum, strong community and unique tokenomics are sparking discussions across crypto circles. As more investors take notice, could Panshibi be set for a breakout, or is it just another hype-driven trend? Tron News : TRX Holders Weigh Their Next Move as Markets Shift Tron (TRX) has been riding a wave of growing adoption, with its USDT balance creeping toward an all-time high . More stablecoins on the network mean more activity and that’s a sign of strength in a market where confidence can be fleeting. But while Tron news highlights its expanding ecosystem, investors are keeping a close eye on what comes next. Despite its strong fundamentals, TRX hasn’t been immune to market swings. It dipped 4.11% over the past 30 days. Right now, the Tron price hovers around $0.238063 , moving within a tight range as traders assess their next move. With meme coins like Panshibi shaking up the market, some TRX holders are wondering if it’s time to diversify. Solana Price : Should SOL Holders Brace for More Volatility or a Market Rebound? Solana (SOL) has been making headlines with major developments that could impact its market trajectory. Coinbase’s introduction of CFTC-regulated Solana futures in the U.S. signals growing institutional interest, potentially driving liquidity and price action in the coming months. At the same time, Solana’s blockchain continues to attract attention, with Sol Strategies hitting new milestones and solidifying its role in decentralized finance. However, the Solana price has faced turbulence, reflecting broader market conditions and investor sentiment. Solana price currently sits around $172 after slipping by 12.70% over the past 7 days. Why TRX & SOL Holders Bet on $0.005 Panshibi to Dominate Soon Crypto moves fast, but Panshibi is moving even faster. TRX and SOL holders are watching closely as this meme-fueled rocket refuses to slow down. Unlike the usual pump-and-dump hype, SHIBI is proving it has real staying power, blending meme culture with actual investor incentives. Right now, the presale is in Stage 4 and the numbers speak for themselves. The token price has soared 150% to $0.005 and investors have already thrown in over $1.1 million. With the Tron price and Solana price constantly shifting, some traders are looking at SHIBI as the next big play that might not just ride the wave but create its own. Industry experts are tipping Panshibi to be the biggest Asian-inspired meme coin, with many predicting it could dominate the sector in 2025. With a 1,200% price increase locked in for the presale and projections of a 145,000% surge post-launch, the numbers suggest exactly what a crypto revolution looks like. With Tron news making waves and Solana price fluctuations keeping traders alert, SHIBI is steadily gaining traction. As momentum builds, it’s positioning itself as a serious contender in the meme coin space, drawing attention from investors looking for the next major breakout. Panshibi Presale Awaits, But Not Forever! Panshibi’s presale is moving fast and those paying attention know exactly why. The buzz around SHIBI is growing louder, with its price primed for an explosive run. While tron news highlights shifting market trends and Solana price action keeps traders guessing, one thing is clear – this meme coin isn’t here to play. It’s here to dominate.

American businessman Mike Novogratz highlighted in a podcast that XRP owes its resilience to its community, which helped the crypto sustain its value over the years. Related Reading: Solana Faces Double Trouble: 55% Network Drop And Price Woes Resilience Of XRP Novogratz was previously skeptical of the lasting power of XRP but in recent years, the American entrepreneur backtracked from his initial skepticism on crypto. The billionaire investor could be the latest addition to those who have changed their opinion on XRP after seeing the crypto remain strong. In a Galaxy Brains podcast, Novogratz acknowledged the resilience of XRP, recognizing the crucial role played by its community to keep the value of the crypt asset. The American businessman explained that XRP began when the crypto ecosystem had not witnessed an oversupply of altcoins, adding that this condition allowed the crypto to build an actual community. He added that the crypto community that XRP successfully built is the primary reason why the digital asset was able to sustain its relevance. Decline Of Ethereum Novogratz mentioned the resiliency of XRP after being asked about the declining performance of Ethereum against Bitcoin. During the podcast, Novogratz was asked for his opinion on when the ETH-to-BTC ratio would be reversed, noting that Ethereum has already dropped significantly against Bitcoin since the merge. The American entrepreneur explained that compared to BTC, Ethereum is a more complex proposition as a global decentralized trust layer, adding that ETH has encountered challenges because of the increase in competition and an oversupply of altcoins in the market. “One of the reasons I think the prices of all these alts are going down is, there are too many of them. There is an infinite amount of token supply coming up and there is not enough time for those narratives to build community,” Novogratz pointed out. Community Engagement Crucial Novogratz was skeptical of the lasting power of XRP but later conceded his belief, saying that he underestimated the XRP Army and the proponents of the XRP community. The billionaire entrepreneur said that XRP has remained relevant due to the crypto’s passionate user base, who have actively defended and promoted the digital asset over the years. He noted that one of the essential aspects of cryptocurrency valuations is community engagement, which has played a big role in the asset valuations of XRP and Bitcoin.

At the same time, Warren is sitting on an all-time high of $334 billion in cash, even as US interest rates are expected to drop. His 2024 annual letter, released on Saturday, was supposed to answer the biggest question on investors’ minds: Why is Berkshire offloading stocks at record speed? But instead of an explanation, Warren doubled down on his love for equities, writing, “Despite what some commentators currently view as an extraordinary cash position at Berkshire, the great majority of your money remains in equities. That preference won’t change.” His actions, however, tell a different story, and this is the longest continuous selling streak in Berkshire’s history. In total, Berkshire sold $143 billion worth of stocks throughout 2024, while buying just $9.2 billion, making it one of his most aggressive divestment years. This sell-off was led by reductions in Apple and Bank of America, two of Berkshire’s largest stock positions. Warren Buffett breaks an investment pattern The fourth quarter of 2024 was the first time in over a decade that Berkshire bought back zero shares, and Warren confirmed that the company had not repurchased any stock in early 2025 either. This was despite Berkshire posting a record 27% rise in operating earnings. “Berkshire shareholders can rest assured that we will forever deploy a substantial majority of their money in equities – mostly American equities although many of these will have international operations of significance. Berkshire will never prefer ownership of cash-equivalent assets over the ownership of good businesses, whether controlled or only partially owned,” Warren wrote in his letter to the shareholders. But after selling more stocks than he has in years, piling up a cash hoard bigger than the GDP of most countries, and refusing to buy even his own company’s shares, many aren’t convinced. His 2024 sell-off comes in the middle of one of the strongest stock market rallies in years. The S&P 500 surged over 20% for two consecutive years, and stocks remain near all-time highs. Yet, Warren—who has consistently outperformed the stock market for years now—isn’t buying. He’s selling. A strategy for Greg Abel? Or a warning sign? At Berkshire’s 2023 annual meeting, Warren shocked investors by announcing that Greg Abel, his long-time vice chairman, would take over all investment decisions, including control over Berkshire’s $368 billion stock portfolio. Some analysts believe the cash piling is about Warren preparing Berkshire for Abel’s leadership. By liquidating stocks, Warren may be giving Abel a clean slate, making sure his successor has the flexibility to make big decisions without being tied to Warren’s legacy investments. Warren himself hinted at Abel’s influence in his latest letter, saying, “Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities. Greg has vividly shown his ability to act at such times as did Charlie.” That comparison to Charlie Munger, Warren’s late right-hand man, was another big sign of his endorsement of Abel’s decision-making skills. Despite his massive stock sell-offs, Warren is still active in one area: Japan. Berkshire has been steadily increasing its stakes in five Japanese trading houses, a position Warren started nearly six years ago. Unlike his American holdings, Warren made it clear that he plans to keep expanding in Japan, writing in his letter that: “Over time, you will likely see Berkshire’s ownership of all five increase somewhat.” Berkshire is now the biggest taxpayer in the US Warren had plenty to say about taxes. In 2024, Berkshire reportedly paid $26.8 billion in corporate income taxes, making it the biggest taxpayer in the United States. That sum accounted for 5% of all corporate tax revenue collected by the US government. In his letter, Warren took the opportunity to warn Washington about reckless spending, writing, “Spend it wisely. Take care of the many who, for no fault of their own, get the short straws in life. They deserve better. And never forget that we need you to maintain a stable currency and that result requires both wisdom and vigilance on your part.” He also reminded lawmakers that the value of the US dollar isn’t invincible, adding, “Paper money can see its value evaporate if fiscal folly prevails. In some countries, this reckless practice has become habitual, and in our country’s short history, the US has come close to the edge.” This isn’t the first time Warren has warned about inflation and reckless government spending, but with Berkshire now sitting on its largest-ever cash reserve, his words carry even more weight. Warren’s 2024 shareholder letter ended on an unusual note. Instead of discussing future plans, he made a rare joke about his own lack of skills outside investing. “Lacking such assets as athletic excellence, a wonderful voice, medical or legal skills or, for that matter, any special talents, I have had to rely on equities throughout my life,” Warren Buffett wrote.

But props to the company for finally starting to repay creditors. It went through with its first round of repayments on February 18, where it paid out the ‘Convenience Class,’ i.e., investors who lost up to $50K. The next FTX repayment distribution will happen on May 30. In addition to the company’s trading partners and vendors, this round will address investors who had assets on the exchange when it went under. It’s worth noting, however, that in order to qualify for this round of distribution, FTX creditors must verify their claims by April 11. FTX Faces Claims from Ineligible Jurisdictions Amid the bankruptcy-repayment saga, FTX creditor and advocate Sunil Kavuri took to X to share a list of 163 countries that are allegedly ineligible for repayment. The list includes countries like China, Russia, Nigeria, Egypt, and Ukraine. Neither Sunil nor FTX has given any reasons for the rejection of claims in these regions. However, Sunil did say that FTX is reviewing its options. The bottom line, therefore, is that FTX repaying its creditors could be very good news for crypto overall. As the date of the next FTX repayment inches closer, here are some of the best meme coins most likely to rally. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Meme Coin for First-Time Investors Although the larger crypto market, including meme coins, benefits from Bitcoin’s growth, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is here to take this correlation to a whole new level. It’s a fresh take on meme coin dynamics, seeing as it won’t just rally because of market hype and community backing but also from increasing crypto adoption and subsequently rising Bitcoin prices. $BTCBULL token holders will receive free $BTC every time Bitcoin hits a new benchmark number, such as $150K, $200K, $250K, and beyond. While other meme coins offer tokens or amusing NFT characters as rewards, BTC Bull Token has become the only crypto project to reward token holders with $BTC, a very valuable asset. Additionally, with 40% of the token supply set to be used for marketing purposes, we can expect $BTCBULL to continue its upward trajectory long after it gets listed on an exchange. The $BTCBULL presale came out all guns blazing and has raised more than $2.6M in less than two weeks. You can join the BTC Bull Army by paying just $0.002375 per token. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana Meme Coin Breathing New Life Into the Network Solana’s recent performance has been suboptimal, to say the least. Especially when it’s one of the top players in the blockchain game and a haven for meme coins. The network is plagued with issues: network congestion, failed transactions, and limited scalability. Enter Solaxy ($SOLX) . A multi-chain token, Solaxy will process transactions off-chain and in batches. This will not only reduce the overall pressure Solana’s mainnet has been facing of late but also reduce transaction costs. With Solana ($SOL) right on the edge of dropping to $125 due to increasing downward pressure, Solaxy ($SOLX) offers a ray of light and what could possibly be the turning point for the network. Poised to be the biggest catalyst behind Solana’s growth, it’s no wonder why $SOLX is one of the top contenders for the next 100x crypto . Luckily for you, the project is currently in presale ($23M+ raised), meaning you can become an investor at some of the lowest prices ever. 1 $SOLX is currently available for just $0.001644. Moreover, early adopters will also be able to benefit from the project’s 176% staking rewards. Here’s how to buy $SOLX . 3. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – AI Agent Offering Crypto Investment Advice If you missed out on the recent $BROCCOLI explosion, chances are you weren’t looking at CZ’s X chatter. We don’t blame you, though. After all, it’s simply impossible to be aware of everything crypto-related going on online. Unless, of course, you’re MIND of Pepe ($MIND) . As the best AI agent coin , $MIND is set to revolutionize how crypto investing works. Gone are the days when you had to be on your toes scouting for investment opportunities. $MIND will do it for you. $MIND will interact with the online crypto community (on dApps and social media platforms like X) and cut through all the varying opinions and insights and mountains of information to identify the next cryptos to explode . The $MIND presale is underway, and you can become an early investor for just $0.0033857 per token. With over $6.7M in presale funding so far, $MIND sits comfortably among the best crypto presales live right now. Here’s how to buy it . 4. Comedian ($BAN) – Trending Community-Driven Meme Coin There’s never a dull day in crypto, and Comedian is the most recent example of this. It’s a relatively new meme coin based on the infamous artwork of Maurizio Cattelan featuring a banana taped to a wall. The artwork, in case you haven’t been up to speed, instantly went viral, sparking debates on whether modern art is really as thought-provoking as it claims to be. Or is it just lazy, overhyped, and borderline insulting to the greats of the past. Launched on the Pump.Fun platform in October 2024, the $BAN token was an immediate success. It rose to $0.3 just days after its launch, generating over 460% gains for early investors. After consolidating for nearly two months, the token is back to dominating the market. It has jumped nearly 100% in the last seven days. The momentum seems to continue as we head into the second week of a fresh Comedian ($BAN) rally. It’s currently trading at $0.1408 . Conclusion Even though times ahead look like they’ll be very kind to crypto and meme coins, it’s always a wise idea to follow healthy investing habits. These include only putting in a small amount and preparing yourself for violent ups and downs. Also, this article shouldn’t be considered financial advice.

Miners face low margins, high competition, and cyclical industry dynamics, often resulting in negative net incomes and the need for continuous capital infusion. Key differentiators among miners include operational efficiency, HODL strategies, and potential pivots to HPC/AI datacenters, though industry dynamics often overshadow these factors. Investors should be cautious, as miners typically lose money over time, even during BTC bull cycles, due to the industry's poor economics and high operational costs. “When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for poor fundamental economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact.” –Warren Buffett The BTC mining industry In my opinion, BTC (BTC-USD) mining is a C+ business and investors should recognize the importance of industry dynamics when investing. BTC miners are often thought of as levered plays on BTC, where, like the tide, the price of BTC lifts or lowers all boats. However, most BTC miners have underperformed BTC in the last year despite several positive catalysts, most important being the increase in the price of BTC. Investors should be cautious and recognize the cyclical nature of the industry is just as important (if not more so) than the qualities of individual companies. And even companies with positive underlying fundamentals usually lose money due to the poor economics of the industry. BTC mining is a straight-forward business where profit is determined by the difference between Bitcoin’s spot price and power and computing costs. For example, if the spot price of BTC is $100,000 and power are computing costs are $70,000, a BTC miner will make $30,000 per BTC. It’s a simple business, but it is not easy. BTC mining is very competitive with low barriers to entry, and despite having low energy costs, miners typically have low margins. For example, none of them made any money last year! Gross margins were positive, but net incomes were negative after including depreciation expense for computers. Because P/E ratios are undefined, EBITDA and CFO multiples are two financial metrics most commonly used for comparison and valuation. EBITDA adds back depreciation expense, which some argue is overstated due to a longer useful life of the computers. However, not replacing miners will eventually result in higher energy costs, so either way, computer costs impact earnings. Cash flow from operations ((CFO)) were also negative– except for a handful of miners. Despite negative CFOs, many miners recycle cash flows into new machines and additional mining capacity to remain competitive. Thus, most miners are running to stand still financially, and investors should question the logic of additional investment. In this article, I use three attributes to differentiate between BTC miners: 1) operational efficiency; 2) whether the miner keeps the BTC it mines or sells it (i.e. a HODL strategy); and 3) whether the miner plans to pivot towards HPC/AI datacenters. Each of these differentiators had positive catalysts last year that caused individual BTC miners to perform well in the short term. However, on the whole BTC miners have underperformed during a bull cycle for BTC. If miners cannot make money during the best of times, it’s certain that they will lose money in the worst of times. A final criticism investors should be aware of is that most miners use stock offerings and convertible bonds to pursue growth at all cost, diluting existing shareholders. So, although the company might have an advantage in the differentiators above (i.e. better profitability, an increase in HODL value, and a pivot to HPC), the equity value of the company will decline because the company continually requires an infusion of new equity to maintain its market position. In conclusion, the economics of BTC mining sort of stinks, and investors should be cautious of the cyclical nature of the industry before investing. Current BTC Bull cycle and positive and negative catalysts: Last year, BTC miners benefitted from multiple positive catalysts that ushered in a new bull cycle. Most important for the bull cycle was an increase in price of BTC. The price of BTC is a positive catalyst for BTC miners for two reasons. First is that it improves margins for the mining business, and second, the price of BTC increases the value of the HODL if the miner holds BTC. As shown in the chart below, the current BTC cycle appears to be progressing similar to previous cycles. Medium.com Source: Where are we in the bitcoin cycle? A second positive catalyst for BTC and miners last year was Trump’s election in November. It is widely expected that Trump’s administration will be positive for the BTC industry with favorable regulations, favorable energy policy, and the potential for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve ((SBR)). A third catalyst for BTC has been investor demand for BTC ETFs and corporate adoption of BTC as a treasury asset. Most prominent in this area is Michael Saylor and Strategy ( MSTR ) purchasing BTC using convertible debt. A final positive catalyst for BTC miners is the creation of a BTC miner ETF by Grayscale. The Grayscale Bitcoin Miners ETF ( MNRS ) will likely increase investment and interest in the industry. To promote their ETF, Grayscale wrote this summary of the industry . Despite the positive catalysts, most BTC miners have underperformed BTC over the last year. For example, the chart below shows miners' performance through the year when compared to BTC. 1 year returns of BTC and 12 miners (Author calculations) Roughly half the BTC miners posted gains over the last year. However, only Core Scientific, Bitdeer, Hut8, and TeraWulf gained more than BTC, with Iris Energy, and Cipher posting returns similar to BTC. 1 year returns for each BTC miners (Author calculations) Lastly, the chart below shows the hypothetical return of $100 invested in BTC when compared to an index of 12 BTC miners. Although BTC was up about 83% over the past year, the BTC miner index was only up about 50%. Comparison of BTC performance and hypothetical BTC Miner index (Author estimates) It can be argued that the returns above are somewhat arbitrary due to the selection of the 1-year, historical time window (i.e. February 2024 - 2025). However, most miners lost money when looking at their financials over the past year. In general, miners briefly made money in Q1 as the increase in BTC price improved margins. However, the BTC halving in the second quarter was a negative catalyst that decreased revenues and returned miners to negative net incomes. As a result, twelve trailing month earnings appear positive for some miners (MARA, RIOT, and HUT), but I doubt that miners will report positive earnings in 2025 unless BTC continues to rise, further increasing margins. The impact of the halving can also be seen in EBITDA and CFO in Q3, which are negative for all but three miners (CORZ, WULF and BITF). Financials for BTC miners (S&P Capital IQ and Author) A second negative catalyst has been an increase in global hash rates, which have increased 50% from about 550 TH/s to 850 TH/s over the last year. Thus, miners that have not increased their production in proportion to the increase in global has rate will mine less BTC per day. Consequently, miners only make money during these short time windows where the BTC price increases, before global hash rates respond to erode (if not eliminate) temporary profits. It will be interesting to watch revenues and income for Q4 2024 and the price of BTC going forward. Global Hash Rate of BTC network (Blockchain.com) A framework for comparing miners The three attributes I use to differentiate miners are: operational efficiency, the miners’ HODL strategy, and whether it plans to pivot to more stable revenues of HPC. Despite these attributes as a way to evaluate miners, the industry dynamics are likely still more important. As the Warren Buffett quote suggests, an A+ operator in a C+ industry will likely lose. Operational Efficiency For operational efficiency, power cost and computer efficiency are the two most important metrics. However, it is really difficult to rank miners by operational efficiency because there are a variety of metrics, which often indicate contradictory performance among miners. Also, I think there is little differentiation in operational performance because power costs and miner efficiency are somewhat uniform. For power costs, miners have established operations around the world near the cheapest sources of power. Often these are stranded, excess energy resources, such as hydropower, nuclear power, natural gas flared from a fracking, or intermittent wind and solar. A miner might get a good deal of 3-4 cents/kWh for electricity, but there is a natural, lower limit for power costs because power producers have to cover their own capital costs of energy production. Good miners have fixed price power agreements behind the meter, where a bad miner will have variable, ‘front of the meter’ power costs. Second, there is little differentiation for computer efficiency because miners all buy the same computers from the same computer three companies (Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT). Although machines might become older and less efficient, most miners upgrade their machines after 2–3 years, and sell the older machines. So a single miner never has a significant advantage for computer efficiency for a substantial period of time. In some ways, miners are like Formula 1 race car teams - they all have the same car design, engine, tires, etc. One team might have a slight advantage for a short period, but the other miners will recognize their advantage and upgrade their machines to eliminate the advantage. Below are three metrics I follow to compare miner’s operational efficiency: BTC miner per exahash; energy efficiency (J/TH) of mining operations; and quarterly mining costs per BTC mined. The table is ranked by market cap, which tends to coincide with the exahash of mining capacity, and thus, the amount of BTC mined per month. Collectively this group of publically traded companies is about $30 billion of market cap, and represents about 31% of the BTC mined on any given day, or roughly 3,900 BTC in December. BTC mined per EH/s and energy efficiency in J/TH are the two best metrics for efficiency. BTC mined per EH/s measures how productive the miner fleet is with each exahash of capacity. Larger numbers are better for this metric, and the best miners report about 18-19 BTC mined per EH. The second is energy efficiency, which measures the amount of energy per unit of computing power. Smaller numbers are better for this metric, with the most efficient miners under 20 J/TH. The final metric is quarterly mining costs for electricity per BTC mined. This metric shows the electrical cost of each BTC mined. Lower cost for each BTC means a miner will have higher gross margins, and likely higher net incomes. Similarly, the final column shows reported energy costs per MWh. The best miners tend to have contracted power between $30-40 MWh (or $0.03-0.04 per kWh). As part of their power agreements, most miners have curtailment obligations, which require miners to decrease their power consumption when demand and power rates increase. As a secondary data point to my numbers below, Anthony Power wrote a great article recently that reconciles capacity, efficiency and power costs across miners. Operational Efficiency metrics (Author from company filings) HODL The second differentiator between BTC miners is whether it keeps the BTC it mines, dubbed a HODL strategy (or hang on for dear life). Due to the price volatility of BTC, some miners historically sold all the BTC it mined to fund operations and report more consistent earnings. Executives of the no HODL strategy are no doubt BTC advocates, but argue that the business of mining and speculation on BTC are two distinct concepts. As they say, ‘If you believe in BTC, buy BTC. But our business is mining, not speculating on the price of BTC.’ Other miners historically sold the bare minimum to fund operations and HODLed the BTC they mined. As a result, historical revenues were lower, but now many of these miners have substantial BTC reserves on the balance sheet. These reserves add leverage, where the market price of BTC adds to or subtracts from the value of the company. Given there will only be 21 million BTC, and that likely 20 million remain due to loss of keys, these HODLs that were established at much lower BTC prices and could potentially exceed the value of the mining operations. As shown in the far-right column, in some cases the mining operations only represent 50% of the value of the company, with the other 50% of the value due to the HODL. To put the HODLs below into context, collectively the group owns about 90,000 BTC. BlackRock BTC ETF owns about 580,000 BTC and Strategy owns about 400,000 BTC, or about 3% and 2% respectively (or 5% in total) of all BTC that will exist. So, the miners are roughly one-quarter the size of the Strategy or BlackRock ETFs, with half of the industry’s HODL owned by Marathon. If the US or some other nation pursues a BTC Reserve and attempts to acquire 500,000 BTC (similar in size to IBIT or MSTR), it will be very difficult to source enough BTC for the reserve without the price of BTC going much higher. In short, miners cannot supply enough BTC from their future mining operations. As mentioned, the miners collectively mine only 3,800 BTC per month. So a BTC reserve of 400,000 BTC would take 100 months to mine, or 9 years of all miners’ production! In my opinion, many BTC miners with HODLs do not currently reflect this upside potential from the price of BTC. As a sub-set of the HODL strategy, some miners also issue convertible debt to purchase BTC in addition to the BTC they mine, implementing a strategy similar to Strategy. HODL Strategy metrics (Author from company filings) HPC Pivot The last differentiator between BTC miners is whether the miner is expanding into high-performance computing (HPC) to leverage their expertise building data centers and power agreements to increase revenues. The advantage of the HPC strategy is that HPC revenues will be more stable, have better margins, and allow for added leverage. Core Scientific set off this trend last summer when it announced a deal to host HPC operations for Core Weave, an AI/ML software developer. The deal has sort of set a high-water mark where Core Scientific will receive $1.5m for each MW of power with 80% margins on the capital invested. TeraWulf was the second company to announce a deal in December 2024. Other miners had hosting operations already (BTDR), or recently acquired data centers ( BTBT ) to enter the HPC space. Riot platforms initially stated they would not host the HPC market, but announced in January that they would pivot to HPC and decrease its energy target for its BTC mining operations. Some people speculate this indicates Riot is close to announcing a deal for its energy assets. Miners that do not intend to pivot to HPC argue that miners lack the financial firepower to compete with tech companies and hyper scalers. For example, the combined market cap of all the miners is $30 billion. Microsoft alone plans to spend $80 billion in capital expenditures in 2025 for AI, or roughly 2.5 times the market cap of the entire miner industry. The Wall Street Journal wrote an article recently that summarized $75 billion in quarterly capex at the tech giants. Also, it is unclear if miners have a unique competitive advantage for hosting compared to other data center operators. Indeed, they have experience building BTC mining facilities, but ultimately most miners plan to offer building shells with power and an internet connection with the customer providing the computers. How exactly is this different than a data center REIT, like Digital Realty Trust (DLR)? (More specified build outs and hosting arrangements are more complex, require server GPU computers, and carry more risk due to computer obsolescence.) HPC Pivot metrics (Author from company filings) Conclusion I hope with this article provided some insight into the industry and provides a warning about some mistakes I’ve made. I first invested in HIVE Digital ( HIVE ) during the BTC bull cycle that began in 2016-2017. It is a small position that I continue to hold. Over this time frame, BTC has increased 50x, rising from $2,000 to $100,000. However, my stock is down 75%! Hive stock performance since 2017 (Yahoo Finance) How is that possible? In theory, the company makes on each BTC that it mines and owns a HODL of BTC. I thought BTC miners were a levered play on the price of BTC? What did I miss? And how can I prevent this from occurring again? I believe the answer is that I failed to understand the basic economics of the industry: that the all in costs to mine a BTC exceed the cost of BTC. I incorrectly assumed that BTC mining would be similar to oil refining and gold mining. In oil refining, profitability is determined by the crack spread, or the difference between oil costs and revenues from refined products, like gasoline. Except for rare time periods like March 2020 when oil prices went negative, refiners are almost guaranteed to make a small profit margin from refining. So, refiners make a small profit over a continual volume of throughput. For gold miners, profitability is usually determined by the all in sustaining costs (AISC) of the mine. Gold miners cannot control the price of gold, and mining is highly capital intensive. So gold miners ensure there is a sufficient buffer between the price of gold and their AISC. Therefore, miners can cut production to maintain profitability if the price of gold declines. So, gold miners make profit based on an estimated volume of production. BTC miners are somewhat a combination of both refiners and gold miners. Net margins are very thin (or negative) similar to refiners. But unlike gold miners, BTC miners cannot control their AISC because of the growth in global hash rate erodes the value of the mine. It’s like a gold mine, where the amount of gold in the ground has a half life and dissipates with time. Miners also believe they grow their way to profitability by improving efficiency and economies of scale. The logic is, “gross margins are good, and we’ll eventually make money if we grow to spread the computational costs out across a wider base of operations.” Growth in global hash rates also requires them to pursue growth, so it seems to make sense. As a result, miners sell each BTC at a loss while trying to make up the loss on volume. This strategy consumes capital from investors who mistakenly believe that miners are a levered play on the price of BTC, and that miners will continue to make money when only at the periods when the economics of mining make sense. BTC miners could perform well if this BTC bull cycle continues. As described above, it really depends on how high the price of BTC goes and whether new investors, that don’t understand the industry, bid up the stocks. But, if or when the cycle ends, miners will likely lose money as the economics of the industry don’t make sense. Time will tell. At the very least, I got a laugh recently when I read that Hive was expanding production … by buying a site from Bitfarms ( BITF ), another BTC miner!

The attack occurred during a routine transfer between wallets, with hackers successfully diverting the funds to an unidentified address. Bybit assured customers their remaining assets were secure but warned of potential withdrawal delays due to the incident. CEO Ben Zhou emphasized that the company could absorb the loss and remain solvent, even if the stolen funds were not recovered. Recent reports suggest that The Lazarus Group, a cybercriminal organization linked to North Korea, is responsible for the hack. Analysts identified substantial overlaps between the hackers’ addresses and those used in previous North Korean cyberattacks. North Korea has a history of targeting cryptocurrency platforms , stealing approximately billions of tokens over the past few years. The U.S. government and international security agencies have warned that such activities help fund North Korea’s missile and weapons programs, increasing geopolitical tensions. Bitcoin Enthusiasts Call for Ethereum’s Intervention In response to the hack, Bitcoin enthusiasts Justin Bechler and Matthew Kratter raised concerns about Ethereum’s role in addressing the situation. Kratter argued that if Ethereum’s leadership does not push through a hard fork to revoke access to the stolen funds, they could be viewed as complicit in “aiding and abetting global terrorism.” Bechler further noted that Ethereum is in a no-win situation: either roll back the chain and prove its centralization or do nothing and risk regulatory consequences for allowing stolen funds to circulate. Vitalik is caught in a nightmare he can't win. Roll back the chain and Ethereum proves it’s centralized. Do nothing and Ethereum funds North Korean terrorism and will suffer brutal OFAC sanctions. Either way, Ethereum is finished. The only question is how fast it collapses. https://t.co/dVI3UZZJfi — Justin Bechler (@1914ad) February 22, 2025 We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Unlike Bitcoin, which operates on a fixed monetary policy and a strict commitment to immutability, Ethereum has historically implemented network changes through hard forks, such as the response to the 2016 DAO hack, which resulted in the creation of Ethereum Classic by those who disagreed. Will the Government Step In? If Ethereum initiates a hard fork to reverse the hack, it would demonstrate a willingness to alter transaction history, raising concerns about its decentralization. Such an action could set a precedent where Ethereum is expected to intervene in major security incidents, potentially undermining its credibility as a neutral and censorship-resistant platform. On the other hand, inaction carries its risks. With North Korea implicated, regulators such as the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) could take enforcement actions, similar to its 2022 sanctions on the cryptocurrency mixing service Tornado Cash. The U.S. government has previously targeted services linked to laundering stolen cryptocurrency, and Ethereum’s response to the Bybit hack may influence future policies regarding blockchain networks.

Market participants are closely watching price movements, with many expecting DOGE to surpass its all-time high of $0.739. As the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reviews multiple applications for a Dogecoin ETF, traders and investors are anticipating a major rally. Dogecoin ETF Filings and Market Expectations Grayscale Investments, CoinShares, and WisdomTree have submitted applications for a Dogecoin ETF, aiming to provide investors with regulated exposure to the cryptocurrency. The SEC has acknowledged Grayscale’s filing, signaling the beginning of a formal review process. If approved, the ETF could attract institutional investors, potentially driving up Dogecoin price. Regulatory sentiment toward cryptocurrencies appears to be shifting, especially under the current administration. Recently, the SEC dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase , reflecting a more crypto-friendly stance. This change has fueled optimism regarding the approval of new crypto investment products, including altcoin ETFs like XRP, Litecoin, Hedera and a Dogecoin ETF. Consequently, analysts suggest that if an ETF receives approval, Dogecoin price could see a substantial increase. Technical Indicators Suggest a Bullish Outlook Chart analysis indicates that Dogecoin price may be preparing for a breakout. A falling wedge pattern has formed on the four-hour chart, and DOGE has broken out of this formation. This pattern is typically seen as a bullish signal, suggesting further price gains. Key indicators also point toward potential upside movement. The Average Directional Index (ADX) stands at 27.95, indicating that a trend is forming. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has risen to 43.67, recovering from oversold conditions. If RSI crosses above 50, it could confirm bullish momentum for Dogecoin price. DOGE/USD 4hr price chart (TradingView) Traders are watching key support and resistance levels. The support level is around $0.23, while resistance sits at $0.26 and $0.30. A move above these levels could signal further gains for Dogecoin price. Analysts Predict DOGE Price Could Reach $3 to $5 Several analysts like Javon Marks are forecasting major price increases for Dogecoin in the current market cycle. Concurrently, Basic Trading has identified $0.2, $0.5, and $5 as key price levels, noting that Dogecoin price is in an upward trend despite recent corrections. The analyst pointed out that DOGE has followed a historical pattern of large percentage gains in previous bull cycles. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has also projected a bullish scenario for Dogecoin price. He highlighted that if the support range between $0.16 and $0.19 holds, DOGE could rally to $3 . Similarly, analyst Trader Tardigrade stated that Dogecoin’s macro chart is showing a similar pattern to the 2017 cycle, which could result in a surge toward $1.7. Other analysts have set even higher price targets. Dima Potts suggested that Dogecoin price could reach $10 if it mirrors past bull market trends. Some traders believe that DOGE’s historical price movements indicate a strong possibility of surpassing previous all-time highs.

Beiko went to X to explain why reverting the chain to its pre-hack state wasn’t an option. He wrote: “It’s worth breaking down why this reasonably sounding proposal is technically intractable for less knowledgeable observers.” Experts push for Ethereum rollback to recover Bybit’s stolen funds The hack on Bybit happened on Feb. 21, following the transfer of funds from the exchange’s multisig wallet to a warm wallet. The transaction did look legitimate, but malicious code had infected the smart contract logic, allowing hackers—thought to be the North Korean Lazarus Group—to drain funds away. Some industry experts have proposed rolling back Ethereum, with BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes and Jan3 CEO Samson Mow both publicly backing the idea of rolling the token back to recover the stolen funds and prevent the North Korean government from spending them. But a rollback like that, Beiko explains, is nothing like Ethereum’s controversial hard fork in 2016 after the TheDAO hack. Hackers took advantage of a vulnerability in TheDAO incident to drain about 15% of all ETH at the time. There was a failsafe whereby withdrawals were delayed for a month, giving developers a chance to intervene. In the end, the community voted in favor of an “irregular state change,” reversing the hack and resulting in the split between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. Beiko elaborated, saying that the same delay did not exist in the Bybit hack. The funds were immediately available and rapidly distributed on-chain, rendering intervention impossible without wider disruption. Ethereum rollback sparks warnings of catastrophic consequences A rollback would be far more disruptive now due to the exponential growth of Ethereum’s infrastructure since 2016, Beiko emphasized, than it was when TheDAO hack happened. The emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, cross-chain bridges, and real-world asset integrations means that any nonstandard state change could trigger failure at a massive scale. Beiko warned that t his level of interconnectedness means that any irregular state change, even if socially palatable, would have near-intractable ripple effects . He continued to say that a rollback would also invalidate many legitimate transactions, affecting thousands of users unrelated to the hack. Anthony Sassano, Ethereum educator, shared a similar sentiment: “That’s not how any of this works, and not even how it worked with TheDAO hack.” Yuga Labs Blockchain VP—using the X handle 0xQuit —also criticized rollback proponents, stating that the economic dislocation caused by that action would be orders of magnitude greater than the $1.5 billion taken. “Thousands of innocent people would get money taken from them, thousands more would receive money they shouldn’t,” 0xQuit wrote. According to the VP, Ethereum has become the foundation of DeFi and the default settlement layer for many rollups, making a rollback impossible. Even Bybit CEO Ben Zhou seemed to waffle on the concept, noting that he was not sure if it was one man’s decision. He suggested that following the blockchain ethos, the decision should perhaps go to a vote to gauge community opinion, but he admitted uncertainty. Blockchain rollbacks were plausible only in Bitcoin’s early days or during the infamous TheDAO incident, but the present level of complexity in Ethereum makes them all but impossible, Beiko concluded. As a decentralized network, Ethereum makes transaction immutability a big deal—once confirmed, it cannot be undone, and reversing it would shake up the rest of the crypto system. As Ethereum developers refuse to revert to the earlier state, the crypto industry will need to look to other means of healing, such as fortifying security measures and facilitating user awareness that will prevent future exploits of this magnitude.

In his latest post , he emphasized that the asset is still filling in an ascending triangle pattern that historically favors breakouts to the upside. #XRP – 12 Hours TF UPDATE: Nothing has changed still filling in the Ascending Triangle. Historical data suggests that ascending triangles breaking out is as follows: 1⃣ To the upside approximately 70-75% of the time. 2⃣ To the downside occur around 25-30% of the time.… pic.twitter.com/E0FXevYE9d — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) February 22, 2025 Key Insights from Egrag Crypto’s Analysis The analyst pointed out that historical data indicates ascending triangles tend to break out in an upward direction approximately 70-75% of the time, while downward breakouts occur only 25-30% of the time. Based on this statistical pattern, Egrag Crypto expects XRP to revisit the $3.2 to $3.4 range. The accompanying chart highlights key price levels, showing current support at $2.4700 and resistance levels at $2.7500, $3.2240, and $3.4000. On the downside, potential targets include $2.0000 and $1.6000. Additionally, the chart outlines previous highs and price movements that align with the overall ascending triangle structure. The “Face Melting Phase” label suggests a significant price movement may be imminent once the resistance is breached. Community Reactions and Technical Perspectives The post sparked discussions among XRP enthusiasts, with several users sharing their views on the technical outlook. One user, BuyTheDip, expressed skepticism about the predictability of price movements, stating : “I think it has a mind of its own! I do believe that TA has some credibility, especially with key resistance lines and so on, but in regards to the direction it goes, the market decides and does what it wants!” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This comment reflects the broader sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, where technical analysis is useful but not an absolute predictor of price movements. External factors such as market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions, and regulatory developments also play a role in determining price trends. Another user supported Egrag Crypto’s technical analysis, pointing out “The five-wave triangle ended at $2.50 and needs to break the top of the ascending triangle to move towards the pattern’s target, the $3.3 level.” This perspective aligns with Elliott Wave Theory, which suggests that market movements often follow recognizable wave structures. If XRP breaks the upper boundary of the triangle, it could confirm the bullish outlook suggested by Egrag Crypto. For traders and investors, the key levels to watch include the $2.4700 support level and the $2.7500 resistance. A confirmed breakout above resistance could lead to a push towards $3.2 and beyond, while a failure to break resistance may result in a retest of lower support zones.

Pseudonymous analyst Credible Crypto tells his 462,900 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks Bitcoin is trading in a wide range between $110,000 and $88,000. While the analyst believes that Bitcoin’s consolidation will eventually resolve to the upside, he predicts that BTC will first drop to the low $80,000 price range to shake out paper-handed traders before kicking off a parabolic surge. “On the higher time frame for BTC, it would be nice to have this multi-month consolidation complete with a clean base as pictured before the next impulse begins. Focus right now is on two ranges – one low time frame (blue) and one high time frame (black). We may or may not visit the highs of the low time frame range first (blue arrow) but ideally would love to see a deviation below the higher time frame range lows before a reversal, reclaim and impulsive move to the upside.” Source: Credible/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that after the correction, Bitcoin will soar to a new all-time of $126,000 by April of this year. The chart also appears to suggest that his short-term bearish outlook for Bitcoin will be invalidated if BTC convincingly takes out its resistance at $110,000. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $96,616, a fractional increase on the day.

The AI-powered prediction suggests that SHIB will climb approximately 5% from its current price of $0.00001570 to reach $0.0000165 by March 1, 2025. “Based on current market trends and SHIB’s historical performance, the token has the potential to gain 5% over the next few days, reaching approximately $0.0000165 by the start of March,” ChatGPT stated. SHIB’s current price of $0.00001570 reflects a 2.51% decline in the past 24 hours, but analysts and enthusiasts remain optimistic about its long-term trajectory. Shiba Inu’s Expanding Ecosystem Fuels Optimism A key factor supporting this bullish prediction is the steady growth of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. According to a recent report from Times Tabloid , SHIB has gained approximately 840,000 new addresses over the past year, bringing the total number of SHIB wallets to 4.64 million as of February 19, 2025. This surge in new addresses indicates increasing interest in SHIB, despite fluctuations in its price. Notably, the number of active wallets holding SHIB with a positive balance has grown from 1.29 million to 1.39 million in the past year. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additionally, the number of long-term holders—wallets holding SHIB for over a year—has increased from 1.03 million to 1.06 million, demonstrating investor confidence in the asset. These figures suggest that SHIB’s user base continues to expand, which could contribute to upward price momentum in the coming weeks. Shibarium’s Role in SHIB’s Growth Another factor that could support SHIB’s price rise is the increasing adoption of Shibarium , the project’s Layer-2 blockchain solution. Designed to improve scalability and reduce transaction fees, Shibarium has been gaining traction since its launch. The network has already processed millions of transactions, showing strong community engagement. As more users and developers adopt Shibarium for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, the demand for SHIB could increase, further boosting its price. Will SHIB Reach ChatGPT’s Target? While ChatGPT’s prediction of a 5% increase for SHIB is based on market trends and ecosystem growth, external factors such as broader crypto market movements, investor sentiment, and macroeconomic conditions could also influence the token’s price. If SHIB maintains its current trajectory, supported by rising adoption and an expanding user base, it could reach the predicted $0.0000165 mark by March 1, 2025.

Since taking control in January, Elon has axed hundreds of employees, stalled investigations, and wiped the agency’s name off its headquarters in Washington, D.C. Trump called it a win, saying his administration had “virtually shut down CFPB.” But behind closed doors, some of his top aides are reportedly worried Elon is moving too fast and could blow everything up in court. Russell Vought, who runs the Office of Management and Budget and is also acting CFPB director, has reportedly shared concerns about D.O.G.E’s lack of discipline. Him and other Trump allies fear Elon’s aggressive tactics could lead to lawsuits, and if a judge intervenes, the CFPB could survive. Notably, the Bloomberg report says a spokesperson for Vought denied any tensions exist, calling the reports “false and just another ax-to-grind story against D.O.G.E.” D.O.G.E slashes CFPB without a clear plan Elon’s team has been wiping out agencies across the federal government since Trump’s inauguration, with D.O.G.E workers firing thousands of employees, canceling contracts, and gutting programs they say don’t fit Trump’s agenda. The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025—a conservative blueprint for the government—called for Congress to eliminate the CFPB, but Elon has bypassed lawmakers completely. Now, D.O.G.E employees are operating out of the CFPB’s basement, tearing through agency contracts, asking staff which ones are required by law, and looking for anything they can cut. When they first arrived, CFPB employees were shocked—according to the report, it seemed like the D.O.G.E team had no idea what the agency even did. The confusion hasn’t slowed them down. Office leases are being reviewed, and oversight of major banks and fintech companies has come to a halt. Former CFPB Director Rohit Chopra slammed Elon’s actions, saying, “Defunding the police that watches over Wall Street and Big Tech will cost consumers billions. The only ones who benefit from shutting down the CFPB are companies that break the law.” Federal employees sue Trump in fear of retaliation As Elon’s D.O.G.E fires workers across Washington, some government employees are reportedly fighting back in court—but anonymously. A group of workers from USAID (U.S. Agency for International Development) persuaded a Maryland judge to let them sue the administration without revealing their names, saying they fear online harassment, losing their jobs, or worse. Federal courts almost never allow plaintiffs to remain anonymous, except in cases involving sexual assault, minors, or extreme retaliation risks. But now, a judge has approved anonymity for two employees suing the Office of Personnel Management, letting them go forward as “Jane Doe 1” and “Jane Doe 2.” The ruling, signed by Judge James Boasberg, says the plaintiffs provided “legitimate concerns about both physical and mental harm.” Boasberg also blocked the administration from firing any more workers until early March. The lawsuits against Trump’s executive orders have mostly come from labor unions, nonprofits, and advocacy groups, but now individual workers are stepping up. Many fear Elon’s online attacks, which target bureaucrats directly to his massive audience on X. One of his posts, where he called USAID a “criminal organization” that “needs to die,” got 33 million views. Elon’s digital payment ambitions and the fall of CFPB The fight over CFPB is also about digital payments. The CFPB oversees payment companies, and Elon has long criticized its interference in private business. Now, with his plans to turn X into a payments powerhouse, removing the CFPB gives him an open playing field. The CFPB was created under Barack Obama, and under Joe Biden, it took on major corporations like Walmart and Capital One. Now, it’s barely functioning. Former Director Vought’s stop-work order froze the agency’s biggest division—consumer financial oversight—shutting down investigations into credit cards, mortgages, and the housing market. There are also claims that Trump’s administration is trying to delete sensitive CFPB records. Bloomberg’s report claims a former chief technologist at the agency filed a legal complaint, saying officials were about to wipe a financial database with key regulatory information. A federal judge temporarily blocked the deletion, but no one knows how long the order will hold. Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of the CFPB’s original creators, is now pushing back. She scheduled a hearing for Tuesday to showcase what the agency has done for consumers, and personally invited Elon to attend. As of press time, he hadn’t RSVP’d.

However, traders are now bullish about a strong recovery in altcoin prices, following Bitcoin’s surge toward the $100K mark. In the upcoming week, we could see promising movements in the prices of Solana, Story, and Ethereum. ETHDenver Could Trigger Renewed Altcoin Interest Ethereum is the main altcoin to watch next week as it could lead the altcoin rally, especially with the ETHDenver 2025 conference starting on February 23. This major event focuses on Ethereum and often sparks the introduction of new projects, updates on Layer 2 technology, and developments in decentralized finance (DeFi). With increasing interest from institutions in Ethereum staking and rollups, any major announcements or partnerships at the conference could significantly increase Ethereum’s value. Moreover, the recent buzz around the SOL ETF could help boost Solana’s price. Overall, any regulatory changes or news could pave the way for a rebound in altcoin prices. Solana Price Analysis The crypto market is bouncing back, leading to a significant price correction for SOL after the Bybit hack. Buyers are currently sending the price above the 23.6% Fib channel. Currently, SOL is trading at $171, having dropped by 0.2% in the last 24 hours. The SOL/USDT trading pair is facing challenges under $180, showing that sellers have strong control at this level. This could be a significant barrier as short-term holders might keep selling off at this price. However, if demand increases, buyers could potentially push past this level soon. If the price drops below the EMA20 trend line on the 1-hour chart, sellers might attempt to drive it down to the $160 support level. Meanwhile, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovering around the midline at 46, it could lead to a retest of the upper resistance channel. If the price stays above $180, it would be advantageous for buyers, possibly driving the price up to $219. Story (IP) Price Analysis Story has seen a notable drop after buyers failed to maintain the level at $9. This drop has weakened buyer confidence to push the price upwards. Currently, IP price is trading at $4.46, having dropped by 0.4% in the last 24 hours. The IP/USDT trading pair is aiming for $5.3 but could face significant resistance, potentially leading to a fallback to the $4 range. Nevertheless, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 48, just around the midline, Story price might continue to see strong buying interest. If the price breaks above $5.3, a correction towards $6.9 could follow. On the other hand, if it falls below $4.1, the price could drop to around $3. Ethereum Price Analysis Ethereum price rebounded strongly following the Bybit hack. Buyers pushed the price of ETH to the key level of $2,800. As of writing, ETH price trades at $2,826, surging over 2.3% in the last 24 hours. If Ether moves below the 20-day EMA of $2,737, sellers might try to drive the ETH/USDT pair below $2,500. If successful, the price could drop further to $2,400 and possibly down to $2,300. Conversely, if the price climbs above $2,850, it might reach the downtrend line. While sellers are likely to defend this level, if buyers manage to break through, the pair could surge toward $3,300.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Ethereum|Solana,EN,0,0,TRADING|ETH|SOL|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-23 08:18:18

The platform features could make it easy for anyone to accept crypto payments. The London-based fintech platform is having a successful presale, raising around $1 million so far, and this is because investors are rushing to the ecosystem to position themselves in what could become the future of payment. Many people believe in the potential of SpacePay and its SPY token to change the way finance is done, and this could easily make the solution valuable to everyone. SpacePay offers a new payment system, but rather than requiring users to get new devices and wallets, it works easily with existing payment and point-of-sale machines and more than 325 wallets. With this, users don’t have to incur the expenses of getting new payment devices. With this, it is easy for many people and businesses to use SpacePay’s solution since they are only required to continue using the system they are accustomed to. Additionally, accepting crypto payments can open up businesses to a new customer base, as people who wish to pay with crypto could be eager to use such stores. How SpacePay Gets the Job Done for Users SpacePay uses various methods to ensure that crypto payments are seamless and more efficient than cash payments. One of the ways is to protect funds from the effects of volatility. When a crypto payment is made, merchants can choose to receive them in the fiat currencies of their choice. An automatic conversion to fiat currency ensures that the value of the funds stays the same, regardless of fluctuations in crypto price during the transaction. The $SPY raise continues! Join a revolution in crypto payments. SpacePay is the bridge merchants need. pic.twitter.com/3NhITlSNvZ — SpacePay (@SpacePayLtd) January 22, 2025 SpacePay’s solution is cost-efficient, as it charges only a 0.5% merchant fee. This straightforward pricing makes it easy to determine how much a merchant will receive during payment. The platform is built to be transparent with pricing and does not impose hidden charges. Another feature the platform offers is the instant settlement of transactions. There is no processing time, unlike a traditional payment system that can sometimes take days to settle. This efficient system has been attracting many to the SpacePay ecosystem. SpacePay Growth Plans and Strategies The presale is part of the plan to bring many people to the ecosystem and form a strong community. The platform carried out a contract audit and is already working on its NFC technology. After the presale, there will be centralized exchange listings, which will allow more people to trade the SPY token, potentially increasing its trading volume and visibility. The platform will launch various payment partnerships to ensure that it continues to provide optimal services to its users. There will also be various API integrations and reward models aimed at rewarding the community and encouraging the constant use of the platform. In addition to all these, the developers will carry out various developments to ensure global expansion and brand establishment. This will involve expanding their marketing reach and strategies, as well as carrying out various scaling operations and bringing features that will enhance user experience and the platform’s offerings. Exclusive Benefits of Holding the SPY Token Holding the SPY token has its own exclusive advantages, such as always having access to a revenue-sharing model where a part of the platform’s revenue is shared with the community members as passive income. Apart from this, token holders will have the right to vote on various features within the platform. This ensures that it continues to grow based on the desires of token holders, who obviously want the best for the project. SpacePay will also reward active participation on the platform through a monthly loyalty airdrop. This is to reward the most active participants within the community with some SPY tokens to encourage constant use of the platform and holding of the token. The SPY holders will also have access to the SpacePay leadership team through quarterly Connect webinars, where they will be able to access more information about the platform’s growth and plans. There is a total supply of 34 billion SPY tokens. 20% of this total supply is allocated for the ongoing presale, 18% is allocated for marketing and community building, and another 18% is set aside for strategic partnerships. 17% is allocated for rewards and loyalty, 12% for a reserve fund, 10% goes for development, and the last 5% is allocated to the team or founding members. SpacePay Presale and Its Offers The ongoing presale has raised nearly $1 million, demonstrating strong investor interest in its crypto payment solutions. The SPY token is available at a favorable price of $0.003126 during this presale phase. Buying the token during the presale offers early access and growth at a reduced price. This purchase price might increase after the official launch. Becoming an SPY token holder is easy. To purchase, connect a decentralized wallet using MetaMask or any other compatible wallet to the SpacePay website . Authorize the transaction with ETH, BNB, MATIC, USDT, USDC, AVAX, BASE, or even a bank card.

In the video attached to the tweet, Garlinghouse addressed the concept of payment friction and how advancements in digital assets, including XRP, could revolutionize payroll systems by enabling instant and continuous compensation. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse on removing payment friction: ""Has everybody thought about why you get paid once a month, or once every 2 weeks? It comes down to the friction of payments. And if we can remove the friction of payments, why can't you get paid every day? Or every… pic.twitter.com/PmH0QDJC0q — Rowen Exchange (@RowenExchange) February 22, 2025 The Problem of Payment Friction Garlinghouse began by posing a fundamental question: why do people typically get paid once a month or every two weeks? He explained that the traditional payroll system is not necessarily based on efficiency or worker preference but rather on the friction inherent in financial transactions. Payment processing, banking constraints, and legacy financial infrastructure have dictated the intervals at which salaries are disbursed. He highlighted that in countries like Singapore, employees are usually paid monthly, while in the United States, a biweekly pay schedule is common. This structure has been accepted as the norm for decades, yet it is primarily a byproduct of the limitations within traditional financial systems. The Potential for Real-Time Payments Garlinghouse suggested that by eliminating the friction associated with payments, employees could theoretically receive their wages in real time. He stated, “If we can remove the friction of payments, why can’t you get paid every day? Or even more crazily, why don’t you get paid every hour or every second?” He describes a scenario where a value could continuously be deposited into a user’s preferred repository of funds without delay. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This concept aligns with the broader vision of blockchain technology and digital assets, which aim to facilitate instantaneous and low-cost transactions. With the advent of solutions like XRP and the technologies built on the XRP Ledger , near-instant financial transactions could become a reality for businesses and workers worldwide. Economic and Social Implications Garlinghouse acknowledged that shifting to real-time payments could trigger unpredictable secondary and tertiary effects. As technological advancements in previous decades led to unforeseen innovations, reducing payment friction could fundamentally alter workplace dynamics, financial management, and spending habits. A response to Rowen Exchange’s tweet from an X user named Christi echoed this sentiment, emphasizing that more frequent payments could reshape work culture. Christi argued that employees being paid in real-time would reinforce the direct connection between labor and earnings, potentially leading to increased productivity, fewer instances of absenteeism, and even reduced reliance on government assistance programs. The Role of XRP in Enabling Instant Transactions The final line of Rowen Exchange’s tweet—“XRP MAKES THE IMPOSSIBLE, POSSIBLE”—underscores the role of digital assets in overcoming existing financial barriers. XRP has long been positioned as a solution for fast, cost-effective cross-border payments, but its potential use cases extend far beyond remittances. The ability to settle transactions in seconds with minimal fees could make it a viable tool for businesses seeking to implement real-time payroll systems.

40722087,https://coinpedia.org/?p=423772,1740299198,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Web2 Giants Are Playing Their Part to Support Crypto Purchases Everywhere,https://coinpedia.org/information/web2-giants-are-playing-their-part-to-support-crypto-purchases-everywhere/,"The post Web2 Giants Are Playing Their Part to Support Crypto Purchases Everywhere appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Once upon a time, crypto was called the wild west, an arid playground run by cowboys with wallets full of BTC and dreams of Lambos. Fast forward to 2025, and that rugged landscape’s been significantly tamed – but has retained its ability to consistently surprise. One of the more pleasant surprises to have surfaced in recent years has been the willingness of businesses once branded the enemy of crypto to support its infiltration into every payment systems. Web2 giants – those familiar names powering your online life – are saddling up, bringing their muscle to the crypto corral. PayPal, Visa, Mastercard: they’re all cantering in, and it’s a genuine game-changer. Why? Because when these titans join the party, crypto stops being a fringe fantasy and starts feeling like something you’d actually use on the daily. They don’t often receive credit for their Damascene conversion, but plaudits are due for the web2 players who’ve come full circle. Financial Players with Skin in the Game Let’s start with the big guns. PayPal kicked things off in 2020, letting users buy, sell, and hold cryptos such as BTC and ETH. By 2024, they’d upped the ante, integrating stablecoin PYUSD and rolling it out to 430 million users worldwide. Visa’s not far behind; since 2021, they’ve settled over $2.5 billion in crypto-linked transactions. Mastercard, meanwhile, are pushing crypto debit cards and piloting blockchain payments. From a user perspective, it means that if you’re already on PayPal or swiping a Visa, crypto’s not a leap – it’s a sidestep. These giants are effectively turning “what’s a wallet?” into “oh, I already have that.” Neo-banks, the cool kids bridging old money and new, are also doing a lot of the heavy lifting here. Take Crypto.com , over 80 million users strong and with billboards at seemingly every major sporting event. Great name, globally recognizable brand. They’ve just added PayPal as a payment method, letting you fund your crypto buys straight from your PayPal balance. This means no interminable transfers, no extra apps: just seamless integration into a platform you already trust. It’s like adding crypto to your financial toolbox without needing a manual. Neo-banks like Crypto.com aren’t so much lowering crypto’s adoption curve as steam-rollering it till it’s pancake flat. Don’t Forget the Partnerships Driving Adoption Web3 projects love a good partnership announcement, and in collaborating with web2’s major players, they’ve inked deals that are more than mere vapor. PayPal and Visa teamed up last year to streamline crypto payouts – think freelancers getting paid in USDC via Visa Direct. Mastercard’s collab with wallet providers like MetaMask and Trust Wallet, meanwhile, let users top up cards with crypto in seconds. Then there’s Mercuryo , the rising fintech star, partnering with web3 heavyweights like Polygon and now powering euro crypto cards with Mastercard. These tie-ups aren’t just headlines; they’re highways, paving the way for crypto to flow into everyday life. Whether you position it as a web2 player streamlining access to web3 or vice-versa, the upshot is that Mercuryo and other payment providers are now mainstays for much of the money that flows between the on- and off-chain worlds 24/7. Why Now? What’s fueling this fire in web2 giants? They’re not entering web3 out of FOMO – they’re smarter than that. Rather, their decision to support the cryptoconomy rather than sit it out on the sidelines is driven by more rational reasoning. With much of the regulatory risk and “exoticness” of crypto having been tempered, it’s a lot safer for these TradFi titans to enter the fray. And there’s money for them to make by connecting the old world with the new. As for the competencies they bring to bear within the crypto arena, first there’s user experience: we’re talking apps so intuitive even your grandma could buy ETH. Second, there’s security: Visa’s fraud protection and PayPal’s two-factor authentication make crypto feel less like a gamble. Third, familiarity: linking crypto to Apple Pay, Google Pay, or your trusty Visa card shrinks the learning curve to a blip. That’s the vibe: safe, simple, and second nature. Case Studies: The Proof’s in the Pudding The partnership between Mercuryo and MetaMask is a masterstroke for simplifying crypto onboarding. Their integration lets users buy crypto with a bank card in under a minute – no wrestling with seed phrases or navigating convoluted exchange signups. By tapping into Mercuryo’s payment infrastructure, MetaMask users can fund their wallets seamlessly, whether it’s ETH for gas fees or stablecoins for DeFi. Mercuryo’s not stopping there. Their focus on localized solutions, such as SEPA transfers in Europe or OVO in Indonesia, means users globally can jump into web3 without friction. The MetaMask hookup has evolved with features like no-KYC purchases up to €699, slashing barriers for newcomers. Users appear to be relishing the ability to top up their wallet with a tap, then spend via Mercuryo’s Mastercard-backed crypto card. It’s a full-circle play: buy crypto fast, spend it faster. PayPal has been a crypto trailblazer since 2020, with 35 million merchants and crypto trading live since 2021. They’ve onboarded millions to crypto, leveraging a user base of 430 million. The real kicker? Their stablecoin, PYUSD , launched in 2023 with Paxos, is now a checkout option across their network. Moving beyond mere hodling, PayPal’s pushing real spending: users can settle tabs with PYUSD at merchants or send it fee-free to friends in the U.S. It’s crypto with training wheels, wrapped in a familiar interface. The numbers back it up: PYUSD’s market cap has climbed past $700 million, fueled by integrations like Venmo and Crypto.com. PayPal’s not just playing in web3; they’re reshaping it for the mainstream. With no fees for buying, selling, or sending PYUSD within their ecosystem (network fees apply externally), PayPal’s betting on trust and scale. It’s a bold pivot from their 1998 roots, proving they can still make an impact on the evolution of digital finance. As a final case study to indicate the role web2 giants are now playing, Visa’s launch of Visa+ is a slick move to link digital wallets for instant payments and their crypto ambitions shine through. A pilot with Coinbase in 2024 saw 10,000 users moving USDC cross-border without the usual remittance headaches. Built on blockchains like Solana, Visa+ leverages stablecoin speed (think sub-second settlement) while keeping the familiar swipe-and-go vibe. It’s a lifeline for freelancers or small businesses, cutting costs that legacy systems like SWIFT pile on. What This Means for Traditional Users For the average Joe, all of this is good news. Barriers are rapidly crumbling and crypto’s no longer a techie’s toy. The interfaces mimic your banking app, so the learning curve’s virtually non-existent. There’s also the deep trust that comes when Visa or PayPal’s involved – these aren’t shady startups. A 2024 Deloitte survey found 62% of U.S. adults would try crypto if offered by a known brand. That’s the web2 effect: turning skeptics into spenders, one big brand at a time. And all of this is just the warmup. Imagine crypto woven into every transaction: paying rent with ETH via PayPal, splitting dinner with Visa+ in USDC. Web2 giants aren’t stopping at buying and selling; they’re eyeing loyalty programs and cross-border micropayments. By 2030, Statista predicts 20% of global payments could involve crypto if integration keeps accelerating. Web2 giants are no longer the NPCs playing a bit part in crypto adoption: they’re web3’s wingmen, dragging the industry from the fringes to the forefront. PayPal, Visa, Mercuryo and their ilk are rewriting digital finance, making it less about geeky experimentation and more about everyday ease. As these titans flex their reach, crypto’s shedding its mystique for something better: everyday utility.",Information,EN,0,0,PYUSD|ETH|USDC|BTC|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-23 08:26:38

With 94% of the first phase sold at $0.01 per token, the window for accessing the lowest price is closing rapidly. Phase 2, which starts soon after, will include a 50% price jump to $0.015. Those entering now stand to lock in a guaranteed 600% return by launch, a surge to $0.06 that’s already baked into the token’s trajectory. Moreover, analysts project a 100x leap to $1 in 2025 when Mutuum Finance’s decentralized lending platform goes live. Dogecoin (DOGE) shows similar potential for a dollar milestone, fueled by technical patterns and ETF speculation. Tron (TRX), however, struggles to break key resistance levels, hinting at a longer wait for its bullish turnaround. Dogecoin Battles Bearish Trends Amid Long-Term Optimism Dogecoin’s price has tumbled 45% since December, sliding from $0.48 to $0.26 as Bitcoin’s stagnation drags the broader crypto market lower. The meme coin’s decline accelerated after January’s “sell the news” reaction to Elon Musk’s advisory role in the Trump administration, a development initially met with enthusiasm. With the crypto fear and greed index plunging to 39 (from 88 earlier this year), DOGE faces headwinds. Yet technical charts suggest a rebound is brewing. A weekly Elliott Wave analysis identifies the current slump as Wave Two, a corrective phase following September’s 180% rally. Historically, Wave Three surges are the longest and strongest, potentially propelling DOGE to $0.76 before a pullback and final ascent to $1. This pattern mirrors 2023’s cycle, where a 63% crash preceded a 200% rebound. Tron’s Slow Grind Faces Uphill Battle Tron (TRX) inches upward by 4% today to $0.24, buoyed by Bitcoin’s modest recovery. The token trades within a bullish channel, testing the $0.249 resistance critical for reaching $0.30. While partnerships with Bitget and Chainlink boosted Q4 transaction volume by 7%, TRX lacks the catalysts driving DOGE and MUTM. Analysts note that breaking $0.249 requires sustained buying pressure, a challenge given TRON’s reliance on broader market sentiment rather than unique utility. Even if successful, the path to $1 demands a 400% climb, a feat unlikely before 2026 given its incremental growth patterns. Mutuum Finance Emerges as the Presale Powerhouse Mutuum Finance (MUTM) dominates attention with a presale that’s rewriting playbooks. The project has raised $1.03 million in days, attracting over 2,010 holders eager to capitalize on its $0.01 entry price. Phase One’s 94% sell-out rate signals intense demand, with a 50% price hike looming in Phase Two. Early buyers aren’t just banking on hype, MUTM’s structured ecosystem, featuring peer-to-contract lending, an overcollateralized stablecoin, and a token buyback system, positions it as a DeFi staple. Tokens purchased today will automatically surge 600% to $0.06 at launch as presale phases incrementally raise prices. Post-launch, platform adoption is expected to fuel a climb to $1 in 2025. Here’s why: 20% of all borrowing fees will fund daily MUTM buybacks, redistributing tokens to stakers and creating relentless upward pressure. Combined with a live beta platform at launch, a rarity for presale projects, Mutuum Finance eliminates the “vaporware” risk plaguing other tokens. A $100,000 giveaway sweetens the deal, rewarding early participants who engage on social media. With only 6% of Phase One tokens remaining, the project exemplifies a rare convergence of low risk and explosive upside. As Dogecoin leans on technical rebounds and Tron battles inertia, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands apart with tangible growth mechanisms and a presale selling out faster than morning headlines. The crypto market’s 2025 story may well be defined by MUTM’s ascent, a journey beginning at $0.01 and eyeing $1 within 12 months. Investors chasing life-changing gains are prioritizing this token, knowing Phase One’s discounted window won’t last. Time Is Running Out, Secure Your Position Today The crypto market rarely offers guarantees, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) comes close. A 600% gain by launch is locked in for Phase One buyers, with a $1 target in 2025 backed by buyback mechanics and real-world utility. Dogecoin’s potential hinges on unpredictable macro trends, while Tron’s gradual rise pales next to MUTM’s trajectory. With under 6% of the first phase remaining, the choice is clear, join the presale now or watch this opportunity vanish like last year’s Bitcoin dip. Visit Mutuum Finance’s official site to purchase MUTM tokens before prices spike, your portfolio will thank you in 2025.

40722628,https://timestabloid.com/?p=58234,1740299429,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,AI Prediction Shows Solana Price Hitting $338.20 & 1Fuel (OFT) 143x In Just A Matter Of 3 Months,https://timestabloid.com/ai-prediction-shows-solana-price-hitting-338-20-1fuel-oft/,"The future of Solana is predicted by AI driven analysis that thinks it might rise to $338.20 in a matter of months, gaining the attention of investors. The real shocker, though, is 1Fuel (OFT), which is set to surge an unbelievable 143x in the same period. Early investors are rushing to stake out positions before the next big wave as demand for high growth opportunities rises. Let’s explore what’s driving these bold predictions and why 1Fuel could be the ultimate breakout token. SOLANA: Can It Hit $338.20? Solana has demonstrated itself as one of the quickest and most scalable blockchain networks in the blockchain space. At $172.89, it is currently trading below its all time high, but has been mostly resilient to market fluctuations. SOLANA PRICE PREDICTION is based on growing network adoption, rising transaction volumes, and potential institutional interest, suggesting a move to $338.20. The potential launch of a Solana based ETF is a key factor behind this prediction. A rapid price surge could follow the flow of institutional funds into Solana. Yet skeptics argue that aggressive forecasts like this would be overly ambitious given Solana’s dependence on retail trading activity. If market conditions worsen, some analysts predict a dip to $153. Solana’s dominance in NFT and DeFi markets is another key driver for this Solana price prediction. Due to the low transaction costs and high speed transactions, Solana has become the go to blockchain for many developers, mostly in the area of gaming and other Web3 applications. While Solana’s network strength cannot be overlooked, it would not be an easy feat to reach $338.20 in three months without a major market wide bullish run or a surge in DeFi and NFT adoption. However, there are risks. First SOL needs to break past the $250 resistance zone for it to hit $338.20. If it doesn’t do so, it could prolong its consolidation phase leaving the next move up delayed. In the crypto space, where volatility is a given, investors should take into account the risks of big bets. 1Fuel’s 143x Potential: More Than Just Hype? The 1Fuel presale has already begun to deliver immediate returns for crypto market expansion potential, but Solana’s crypto market expansion potential is dependent on external factors. Those who got in early have already captured 80% growth, as the project has raised over $2.3 million in presale funding. What makes 1Fuel different from pure speculative assets is it has cross chain capabilities and peer to peer transaction security. Unlike Solana, which is already a fully functioning blockchain, 1Fuel is very much in its early growth stages, where the bulk of returns usually happen. Investors, meanwhile, are getting extra benefits with a structured presale model, such as a 40% purchase bonus for new buyers before the February 23rd deadline. The most aggressive SOLANA PRICE PREDICTION indicates a 96% increase, while 1Fuel’s 143x predicted return is based on early market positioning. If the project were to fulfil its roadmap, its price post launch could shoot up and yield the kind of returns top tier blockchains rarely achieve. Conclusion 1Fuel’s 143x potential and 40% purchase bonus provides a more immediate buy-upside for those willing to take a calculated risk. There’s still a possibility that Solana could remain a viable contender, but it is 1Fuel’s presale that is attracting serious attention of traders eyeing up the next high reward opportunity. Early investors are making their move with only days to go before its bonus deadline. Get ready to take part in the explosive growth potential of 1Fuel and join its presale today.

Toncoin aims to provide fast, scalable, and decentralized solutions for the Web3 space. What sets Toncoin apart is its focus on scalability—unlike many other blockchains that struggle with slow transaction speeds and high fees, Toncoin is designed to handle millions of transactions per second with low fees. Telegram’s backing is also a significant factor in Toncoin’s success. With over 500 million active users, Telegram offers an enormous potential user base that could drive the adoption of Toncoin.

An address suspected to be affiliated with Bybit (0x2E…1b77) recently purchased 100 million USDT from address 0xEC…B5E76 and allocated 50 million USDT each to Galaxy Digital and FalconX OTC addresses. This transaction enabled the purchase of approximately 36,900 ETH, which was then deposited to Bybit. In a subsequent transaction, Bybit purchased an additional 17,500 ETH through Galaxy Digital’s OTC services. Additionally, over an 11-hour period, the suspicious Bybit address (0x2E…1b77) purchased an additional 34,800 ETH, which was deposited into Bybit, transferring $48 million to Galaxy Digital and FalconX.

The 48-year-old businessman from Ahmedabad had a redefining moment in the digital era, learning his lesson the hard way. According to reports, the elaborate scam began like any other friendly interaction on the messaging app, with the perpetrator sending the Indian businessman a friend request and him approving it. Things soon moved quickly, with both parties sharing contacts before the victim was introduced to the crypto investment platform. According to authorities, it turned out that the investment opportunity turned out to be a scam. Indian businessman falls for elaborate crypto investment scam According to the complaint registered with the Cybercrime unit of the Police, the pair first met in August 2024 on Facebook. The Indian businessman received a friend request on Facebook from a beautiful woman. According to the complaint, the woman claimed to be involved in gym equipment businesses, offering services in Dubai and Mumbai. In their usual modus operandi, the scammer reached out to the man after seeing his profile. “Hey, your profile caught my eye while checking my friends’ suggestions, and thought I would reach out. Can we get to know each other?” the scammer asked. After he responded to their chats, they began to talk and soon moved things from Facebook to WhatsApp. After a while, she made her move, introducing him to a lucrative cryptocurrency investment opportunity. According to the chats, she mentioned that her uncle was a high-ranking officer at the American firm in charge of the platform and would help the Indian businessman out. The Indian businessman mentioned that he went online to research the company and discovered it was legitimate. He mentioned that he saw that they promised a high return on investment, leading him to invest $500 in the beginning, and he received a $250 profit on the investment. Encouraged by the return, he began to send more funds to the platform, with his funds on the platform totaling about Rs 6 crore ($692k). Authorities register a complaint against the scammer According to the Indian businessman, things started to look like it was a scam when he tried to withdraw from his investment, and he was asked to pay a 20% tax upfront. He mentioned that he was not told about this initially, and he tried to contact the woman without success. This is typical for crimes like these, where the criminals try to maintain contact to have their victims send as much money as they can, and as soon as they realize that their scam is blown, they cut communications, taking the money and trying to hide before they strike again. Authorities mentioned that after the woman became unreachable, further research into the investment platform showed that it was an elaborate scam. The man mentioned that he was only able to get only Rs. 92,000 from his entire Rs. 1.92 crore investment, leading him to go to the police to report to the cybercrime unit. The police have filed a complaint for criminal conspiracy, cheating by impersonation, and criminal breach of trust against the unidentified offender. The scam also shows that people still need education about the crypto sector. The criminals used the ignorance of the businessman about the crypto sector against him, leading him to part with a heavy amount of money. Authorities have also warned the general public about individuals proposing crypto investment schemes, as they are usually fake. Traders and residents interested in carrying out activities in the crypto market are advised to go to seasoned professionals and trusted platforms to carry out their activities. That way, they run a lesser risk of losing their funds to criminals.

The entire crypto market has faced heightened volatility and instability following weeks of selling pressure. Investors remain on edge after Friday’s Bybit hack, which saw $1.5 billion worth of ETH stolen, further fueling market-wide fear and caution. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Serious Price Compression – What Happened Last Time Despite the uncertainty, Chainlink is showing signs of strength. Key data from Glassnode reveals that Chainlink network growth is accelerating, with the number of new $LINK addresses surging to 2,298—its highest level since January. This spike in network activity suggests increasing adoption and renewed interest from investors, potentially signaling a shift in sentiment for the oracle-based cryptocurrency. As Chainlink continues to consolidate at key demand levels, traders are watching closely for a potential breakout. A strong recovery in network growth could translate into higher buying pressure, helping LINK reclaim critical resistance levels and break out of its current range. However, if bearish sentiment persists, LINK could struggle to maintain support, leading to further downside. With the market at a pivotal point, the coming days will be crucial in determining whether Chainlink can capitalize on its growing network activity and push higher. Chainlink Grows Amid Uncertainty Chainlink has continued to expand despite the broader market uncertainty and volatility, demonstrating resilience even as prices struggle to break above key resistance levels. While many altcoins have faced extreme selling pressure in recent weeks, LINK has held strong above crucial demand zones, maintaining its position as a top-performing project in the Oracle sector. One of the key drivers of Chainlink’s strength is its continued strategic partnerships, including its collaboration with XRP, which highlights the growing demand for reliable decentralized data solutions in the blockchain space. As the market looks ahead, Chainlink investors remain optimistic about the project’s potential in 2024. Many analysts expect LINK to have a bullish year, with increasing adoption fueling further price appreciation. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared Glassnode data on X, revealing that Chainlink network growth is accelerating significantly. The number of new LINK addresses has surged to 2,298, its highest level since January. This surge in network activity suggests growing investor interest and adoption, both of which are typically bullish indicators for price action.

Price Action Details: Testing Crucial Demand Chainlink (LINK) is currently trading at $17 after multiple attempts to reclaim the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) around the $18 level. Bulls are facing a critical moment as LINK consolidates below key resistance, struggling to gain enough momentum for a breakout. If buyers step in and reclaim the $18 level, the next major hurdle will be the psychological $20 mark. A strong push above this level could trigger an aggressive rally into higher price targets, setting the stage for a bullish continuation. However, if LINK fails to hold the $17 support level, the price could face renewed selling pressure, leading to a potential drop into lower demand zones. Given the current market uncertainty, investors are closely monitoring these levels to determine the next directional move. The recent increase in new Chainlink addresses, as reported by Glassnode, suggests growing investor interest, which could provide the necessary fuel for an uptrend.

Apple recently disabled its data security tools for customers in the UK after the United Kingdom government demanded that the iPhone maker turn over user data to British authorities. This move means that Apple and the government can now access the previously private data of Apple’s UK users. In its defense, Apple claims that more sensitive information like communications over text and phone calls will remain end-to-end encrypted. Predictably, iPhone users in the UK are unhappy about this situation. Tom Harwood, British journalist, political commentator, and television show host, took to the X (formerly Twitter) social media platform to express his displeasure with the situation stating, “No UK customer data stored on iCloud will be encrypted, making it all accessible by Apple, the Government, and – frankly – the most horrific hackers you can possibly imagine. Imagine the blackmail, extortion, and identity theft the government is bringing on its own citizens.” Apple’s compliance with the UK government’s demands Apple introduced the Advanced Data Protection (ADP) feature in late 2022 to provide end-to-end encryption for iCloud backups. That way, only users can access their own iCloud data using their passwords. However, the UK government, while citing the Investigatory Powers Act of 2016 , filed a secret order for Apple to remove the ADP feature for UK customers. Without the ADP’s encryption, the UK government can have Apple provide access to encrypted users’ iCloud data upon request. There have been other moments when Apple’s security measures have caused tension with law enforcement and governments. In 2016, Apple was in a standoff with law enforcement after it refused to unlock the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone. Choosing to remove the ADP feature for UK customers entirely means that Apple has acquiesced to compromise its encryption standards. This decision also means that UK users’ iCloud data is no longer protected by end-to-end encryption. Apple can now access the data its UK uses store on their iClouds, by extension, the government under lawful requests, and by extension, bad actors with the equipment or clearance. While Apple has said it is disappointed over this outcome, it maintains that certain data categories, such as iCloud Keychain passwords, health app data, and communications on iMessage and FaceTime, will continue to be end-to-end encrypted. Vitalik Buterin weighs in In response to the UK’s demands and Apple’s subsequent compliance, Buterin shared his disapproval on his X account. Vitalik urged security agencies like the United States National Security Agency (NSA) and the United Kingdom’s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) to work towards enhancing citizens’ digital security. “Glad to see this backdoor push getting a much-deserved smackdown,” Vitalik tweeted in response to a tweet by Rt. Hon Ben Wallace, former UK Secretary of State for Defense. Vitalik pointed out the inherent dangers of centralized data collection points such as government or corporate databases, noting that they are susceptible to access by various adversaries. Buterin recalled the Louisiana drivers’ license cyber attack to support his argument.

This has resulted in increased demand for facilities that offer quality crypto signals and insights. For investors looking to find underrated altcoins, meme coin gems, and for traders looking to make huge profits alike, these crypto signals could serve as a significant advantage. Below, we list some of the best crypto signal entities that have been gaining traction lately. Best Crypto Signals in 2025 Best Wallet Crypto wallets are no longer just digital vaults for storing assets—they’ve evolved into multifunctional platforms that serve as trading assistants, market trackers, and signal providers. Best Wallet exemplifies this transformation, aiming to build a fully integrated crypto ecosystem for its users. Rather than making investors sift through endless Telegram groups and Discord servers, Best Wallet compiles underrated crypto gems, market analytics, and trading insights directly within the app. This means users aren’t just storing their tokens; they’re also discovering promising new projects and gaining access to high-quality data that can help them make profitable decisions. $10M raised and Best Wallet keeps growing! 🔥Holding $BEST isn’t just about being part of the fastest-growing crypto wallet. It comes with real advantages that put you ahead of the game:✅ Exclusive Airdrop Rewards✅ Alpha on The Hottest New Tokens✅ Total Control in One… pic.twitter.com/mRJp7jorsG — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) February 17, 2025 The project’s community and several crypto signal website lists have already dubbed Best Wallet one of the best Web3-themed storage solutions in the space, primarily due to its focus on building a variety of features around its primary use case. Its native token offering was also introduced with a presale not long ago and has managed to raise more than $10 million already—another achievement that indicates the rising demand for the platform as a whole. Best Wallet’s Upcoming Tokens feature plays a major role here, highlighting new launches before they hit the mainstream radar. Add in real-time market indicators, graphical data insights, and portfolio tracking, and you have a crypto wallet that doubles as an advanced investment tool. For those who prefer a more streamlined approach without bouncing between multiple platforms, Best Wallet is positioning itself as a one-stop solution—combining secure asset management with premium market intelligence. Jacob Crypto Bury Not all crypto influencers provide actual value, but Jacob Crypto Bury has built a reputation for delivering well-researched insights rather than just chasing trends. His Patreon-based subscription model offers structured access to exclusive trade setups, while his Discord communities serve as interactive hubs where members receive free calls, engage in discussions, and track market developments in real time. His ability to identify high-growth projects even before their official launches has drawn in traders looking for early-stage opportunities. While many influencers focus on hype, Jacob’s approach is data-driven and analytical, helping his community differentiate between genuine opportunities and short-term speculation. Jacob also recently posted a video on his YouTube channel where he asked AI to come up with the best crypto signals, and his Discord came up as one of the best options in the market—an impressive feat that has helped him build more trust with his followers. The structured tiers on Jacob’s Patreon allow members to pick a plan that fits their risk appetite, while the free calls ensure that even casual investors can benefit from his insights. Whether it's market breakdowns, technical analysis, or just solid trade ideas, Jacob Crypto Bury has carved out a space as a reliable voice in the crypto trading world. Crypto Whale Pumps For those who prefer real-time, no-nonsense trade signals, Crypto Whale Pumps delivers exactly that. The platform skips unnecessary frills and directs users straight to its Telegram channel, where its founder actively shares premium insights and trading strategies. The service costs $100 per month, but within the community, this is seen as an amount that can be quickly recouped through smart trades. The focus here is on early-stage token plays, futures trading setups, and high-potential altcoins, allowing subscribers to catch major moves before they gain wider attention. Unlike some overly complex signal groups, Crypto Whale Pumps keeps things straightforward and actionable, with clear entry and exit points, risk management strategies, and an emphasis on discipline rather than reckless trading. For traders who want direct access to a structured trading approach without unnecessary distractions, this Telegram-based platform has proven itself as a go-to resource. WallStreetBets If there’s one name that defines modern-day degenerate trading culture, it’s WallStreetBets. What started as a Reddit movement during the GameStop saga has evolved into one of the largest and most chaotic trading communities across social media. The group is not run by a central authority—there’s no official ""leader"" handing out trading calls, which means that while it offers fantastic insight into market sentiment, it also requires traders to exercise caution. Discussions range from high-risk leverage trading to meme coin speculation, and while many profitable plays originate from these forums, it's essential to cross-check any information before acting on it. The key takeaway? WallStreetBets is an incredible tool for gauging market hype, identifying early trends, and staying ahead of speculative movements, but it should never be treated as a fully reliable source for trading signals. Those who engage with the community and conduct their own research can find gold, but blindly following posts without verification is a quick way to get liquidated. Learn2Trade For traders who prefer structured, technical analysis-backed signals, Learn2Trade provides one of the most organized crypto signal services available today. Rather than relying purely on market sentiment or speculative plays, the platform uses technical indicators, chart patterns, and real-time market data to generate accurate trade setups. The service operates on a freemium model, with a free Telegram group offering three signals per week, while the premium subscription provides three signals daily. Unlike some providers that throw out vague trade ideas, Learn2Trade delivers precise entry, stop-loss, and take-profit levels, ensuring that traders have a clear roadmap to follow. The platform isn’t just about signals—it also offers market analysis, educational content, and forex trading insights, making it a comprehensive resource for those who want a more methodical approach to crypto trading. Whether you’re a casual trader looking for occasional insights or an active participant who needs consistent signals, Learn2Trade stands out as a well-rounded option for structured and disciplined trading. Conclusion The demand for crypto signals has undoubtedly surged alongside increasing investor participation in the market. However, not all signals are created equal, and blindly following unreliable sources can lead to avoidable losses. The key to making the most out of crypto trading signals is trust—ensuring that the provider has a proven track record, clear strategies, and a transparent approach to risk management. As the bull run continues to unfold, having access to high-quality trading signals could prove to be an invaluable asset. Choosing reputable providers like the ones mentioned above ensures that investors stay ahead of trends, make informed decisions, and maximize their gains without falling into the trap of misleading or speculative calls. With the right signal provider, traders can capitalize on opportunities with confidence while managing risk effectively.

33767162,[object Object],1740304834,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Records Heartbreaking 96% Crash In Transactions, What’s Going On?",https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-heartbreaking-96-crash/,"Shiba Inu’s Shibarium has suffered a heartbreaking decline in activity, dropping to new lows not seen in a long while. Reports reveal that the Layer 2 network has seen its daily transaction count plummet by over 96%, signaling a slowdown in user engagement and network usage. Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Activity Crashes 98% Shibarium, a prominent blockchain network designed to improve the Shiba Inu ecosystem, has been experiencing poor performance lately. Data from ShibariumScan reveals that the network’s daily transactions have collapsed to 52,410, marking a sharp and drastic shift in user engagement. Notably, transactions were up to 151,090. However, in the past 24 hours, Shibarium has clearly taken another hit , dropping more than 60% from the initial value. Additionally, on February 14, Shibarium Scan recorded an increase in daily transactions, rising as much as 4.77 million. In just a week, this lofty figure has crashed to heartbreaking lows, reflecting market uncertainty and declining interest in the ecosystem. The sharp drop in Shibarium’s daily transactions also suggests that users may be losing confidence in the network’s ability to sustain high activity levels, especially in volatile markets. Notably, this massive crash comes amidst a broader market downturn and volatility . Recently, the market crashed severely following Bitcoin’s decline below the $100,000 threshold. Following BTC’s downtrend, major meme coins, including Shiba Inu, plummeted, with its price dropping from previous highs above $0.00002 to $0.000015 currently. Given that Bitcoin has failed to break past the bearish trend and reclaim its previous position above $100,000, other altcoins and meme coins seem to be experiencing a similar restriction in their momentum. While this less-than-optimistic market environment has not been ideal for Shibarium’s growth, its overall transaction count is still rising, albeit slowly. It is also steadily approaching a key milestone, with it hitting a 1 billion transaction count. Will The Shiba Inu Price Be Affected By Shibarium’s Crash? Although the recent downturn in Shibarium transactions has raised questions and could impact the Shiba Inu ecosystem, it’s still uncertain whether this drawdown will directly influence SHIB’s price action . Typically, when the Shibarium network is thriving and experiencing a surge in transactions, it helps to boost the meme coin’s utility and overall long-term sustainability and adoption. However, with transaction volumes plummeting, this could significantly reduce burn rates — an activity that is aimed at decreasing the meme coin’s supply and driving price appreciation. Not only this, declining network engagement could exacerbate selling pressures , putting more burden on the already weak market.

Most altcoins are also quite sluggish on a daily scale, while ETH has gained 3%, which is somewhat surprising, given its role in the aforementioned attack. BTC Stands Above $96K After last Friday’s unsuccessful attempt to break $99,000, the primary cryptocurrency spent the previous weekend trading sideways at around $97,000. The business week began on the wrong foot as the asset dropped to $95,500 on Monday and even further south on Tuesday – to $93,500. This became its lowest price point in over two weeks. However, the bulls managed to intervene at this point and didn’t allow another correction. In contrast, bitcoin started to recover some ground and went on the offensive on Friday. Following positive news from Coinbase in regards to its lawsuit against the SEC, BTC’s price climbed to a 13-day peak of $99,500. As the community was preparing for another charge at $100,000, the landscape in the entire crypto industry changed as Bybit was compromised in what has become the largest hack against a digital asset company when $1.5 billion in ETH was siphoned from one of its hot wallets. BTC reacted immediately, with its price tumbling by over four grand in hours. Nevertheless, it managed to bounce off on Saturday and jumped above $96,000 where it currently stands as well. Its market cap has remained at $1.910 trillion, while its dominance over the alts has taken a hit and is down to 57.5%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView OM on the Run Most larger-cap alts are with minor gains over the past 24 hours. This includes BNB, DOGE, ADA, TRX, LINK, XLM, AVAX, LTC, and SUI. Ethereum and Toncoin have added more than 3% of value within the same timeframe and now sit above $2,800 and close to $3.8, respectively. However, OM has stolen the show from the larger-cap alts. Mantra’s native token has soared by roughly 12% in the past day and now trades well above $8.5. Minor losses are evident from XRP, SOL HBAR, WBT, HYPE, MNT, ONDO, and a few others. The total crypto market cap has remained at essentially the same spot as yesterday, at just over $3.320 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.
