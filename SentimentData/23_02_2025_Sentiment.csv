40700758,https://coingape.com/?post_type=markets&p=240475,1740259728,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,PEPE Price Rebounds 6% as Analyst Predicts Ethereum Gains from Bybit Losses,https://coingape.com/markets/pepe-price-rebounds-6-as-analyst-predicts-ethereum-gains-from-bybit-losses/,"PEPE price surged 6%, defying market turmoil after Bybit’s $1.4 billion hack—could this be the start of a major rebound? PEPE rebounds 6% as traders bet on Ethereum gains from Bybit Hack PEPE suffered considerable losses on Friday, mirroring the $75 billion crypto market capitulation in the aftermath of the Bybit hack . The Bybit exploit, linked to the notorious Lazarus Group , saw the exchange lose over 400,000 ETH—worth approximately $1.4 billion at the time of the breach. Given that the stolen funds were in ETH, Ethereum-hosted assets like PEPE bore the brunt of the sell-off. PEPE’s price plummeted by 10% on Friday, while rival meme coins such as Dogecoin and Solana’s Dogwifhat (WIF) contained their losses below 5% in the immediate hours following the hack. PEPE Price Action, Feb 22, 2025 | Source: TradingView However, the broader crypto industry quickly rallied to provide support. Binance transferred over 50,000 ETH to Bybit, helping to stabilize liquidity for traders seeking withdrawals. Additionally, Bybit’s CEO reassured users about the safety of their funds. These interventions appear to have averted a systemic market collapse reminiscent of previous exchange mishaps, such as the FTX crash, which saw global crypto market capitalization shrink by nearly 50% within 10 days. However, 24 hours of the Bybit hack, PEPE price showed early signs of recovery, climbing 6% to reclaim the $0.00009 level at press time. Bulls bet $9M on PEPE rally as analysts hint at Ethereum buy-back to offset Bybit losses At press time, the Bybit exploit remains unresolved, with the stolen funds still sitting in a series of cold wallets identified by Arkham Intelligence. While Bybit’s security team collaborates with law enforcement agencies, speculation has emerged over how the exchange might recover the stolen assets. Some market analysts suggest that Bybit may be forced to repurchase the equivalent of the stolen ETH to reimburse customers and balance its books. Prominent analyst Ash Crypto echoed this view while alerting his 1.6 million followers on X (formerly Twitter) about the hack on Friday: “BYBIT hacker can’t sell $1.45 billion ETH for USDC or USDT because it will get frozen by Circle or Tether. So he just took $1.46 billion selling pressure from ETH. For BYBIT to cover customer ETH, they will have to buy $1.46 billion worth of ETH from (the) market.” — Ash Crypto, (Analyst) Feb. 21, 2025 With approximately 120 million ETH in circulation, the 400,000 ETH stolen from Bybit represents about 3% of total supply. If Bybit moves to repurchase the stolen ETH from the open market, it could significantly constrain available liquidity, potentially triggering a sharp price surge for Ethereum and other ecosystem tokens. Meanwhile, PEPE’s 6% price recovery appears to be bolstered by aggressive positioning in the derivatives market. Data from Coinglass, a leading on-chain analytics platform, suggests that strategic traders are already speculating on a continued rebound. PEPE Liquidation Map, Feb 22, 2025 | Coinglass Coinglass ’ liquidation heatmaps track the total capital deployed in leveraged long and short positions for specific assets, providing real-time insights into shifts in market sentiment. As the broader market stabilized, PEPE traders aggressively built up long positions. The latest data indicates that PEPE long positions have reached $9 million, significantly outpacing short positions at just $2.9 million—a disparity of nearly 70%. This substantial leverage gap implies that, as the market recovery unfolds, short traders may be reluctant to cover their positions, further fueling upside momentum. While PEPE remains below the $0.000010 threshold and has yet to fully erase its 10% losses from the Friday crash, the growing long interest suggests sustained bullish momentum in the days ahead. If Ethereum’s price action strengthens due to anticipated buy-backs, PEPE’s recovery phase could gain additional traction, positioning it for further upside. PEPE Price Forecast: Close Above $0.000011 Could Kickstart Recovery Phase PEPE price forecast suggests an emerging recovery phase as the Ethereum-hosted memecoin rebounds 6% following Friday’s sharp drop triggered by the Bybit hack. The chart shows a notable shift in momentum, with PEPE rising above the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) at $0.00000948, indicating that recent buyers have been willing to pay slightly higher prices to secure their positions. This suggests competitive demand, with traders positioning ahead of a potential full recovery to pre-Bybit crash levels. PEPE Price Forecast The daily candlestick structure presents a mixed outlook. The lower Bollinger Band has provided dynamic support, preventing deeper declines, while PEPE’s latest green candle signals an early attempt at a trend reversal. However, a confirmed breakout above the upper Donchian Channel resistance at $0.00001144 is crucial to sustain a bullish continuation. A close above this level could accelerate momentum, driving prices toward the $0.00001200 resistance. On the downside, failure to hold above VWAP could invite another wave of selling, potentially retesting Friday’s lows near $0.00000796. The volume delta remains negative overall, suggesting sellers are still present, but the uptick in green bars during the daily time frame signals a bump in PEPE spot market liquidity as buying interest gradually returns. If bulls maintain dominance in the derivatives markets, PEPE could regain lost ground, solidifying its recovery phase.

Kanye West announced that he will launch his own token next week. However, in his previous statements, he said that all tokens were for the purpose of scamming his followers and declared that he would never release a token. On the other hand, there may be an unusual partnership in the memecoin that West will launch. West retweeted Binance founder Changpeng Zhao’s tweet that “decentralized exchanges are very hard to use.” In addition, it is noteworthy that the only person West, who has 33 million followers, follows on Twitter is Changpeng Zhao.

VanEck Research Weighs In,https://thecoinrise.com/can-bitcoin-pay-off-u-s-debt-vaneck-research-weighs-in/,"The idea of using Bitcoin to reduce the U.S. national debt has been making headlines, especially in President Donald Trump’s speech at the Nashville Bitcoin Conference in July 2024. Following his remarks, the US. Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced a bill proposing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. She said the bill was proposed to help cut down the country’s massive debt. As reported by Crypto.News, a new report from VanEck, an investment management firm, sheds light on whether this plan is feasible. What VanEck’s Research Says According to VanEck’s latest findings, the U.S. government would need to buy one million bitcoins over the next five years and hold them for 20 years. If this plan goes ahead, by 2049, the total value of these bitcoins could reach around $21 trillion. However, this would only cover approximately 18% of the national debt, which is expected to hit $116 trillion by then. It was stated in the report that to achieve these figures, Bitcoin’s price would need to grow at an average rate of 25% per year, eventually reaching $21 billion per coin. Meanwhile, the national debt is projected to rise by 5% annually. While Bitcoin has seen much growth in the past, there is no guarantee it will maintain this pace for the next two decades. In addition, the report mentioned that the acquisition of one million bitcoins would bring about many challenges. This is because the total supply of Bitcoin is currently capped at 21 million. So, any attempts at large government purchases could drive up prices. This will make acquisitions more expensive. Could Bitcoin Ever Erase U.S. Debt? Despite rumors that Bitcoin could wipe out U.S. debt, VanEck’s research suggests otherwise. Paying off the entire debt would require over five million bitcoins at today’s projected growth rates. However, since only 21 million bitcoins exist, this is simply impossible. Furthermore, even if Bitcoin reached $1 million per coin, the U.S. government would still need 36 million bitcoins to clear its debt. On top of that, selling such a massive amount would likely crash the market, further diminishing the value of the reserves. Bitcoin as a Partial Solution While Bitcoin could contribute to debt reduction, it is far from a complete solution. As Senator Lummis initially stated, the aim is to reduce debt, not eliminate it. VanEck’s research supports this perspective, showing that while a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve might help, it is not a magic fix. Since Senator Lummis introduced the bill, several state lawmakers across the U.S. have been considering similar proposals for Bitcoin reserves. For instance, Utah’s Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Bill recently passed the House with an 8-1 vote and is now under review by the Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee. Also, other states, including Florida, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Oklahoma, have also moved to establish Bitcoin reserves. The post Can Bitcoin Pay Off U.S. Debt?

In Berkshire Hathaway’s annual letter to shareholders, Buffett warns the stability and purchasing power of the US dollar can be easily eroded. “Paper money can see its value evaporate if fiscal folly prevails. In some countries, this reckless practice has become habitual, and, in our country’s short history, the U.S. has come close to the edge. Fixed-coupon bonds provide no protection against runaway currency.” Buffett says capitalism itself is suffering from historic levels of abuse within the system, although its power to promote prosperity remains unmatched. “One way or another, the sensible – better yet imaginative – deployment of savings by citizens is required to propel an ever-growing societal output of desired goods and services. This system is called capitalism. It has its faults and abuses – in certain respects more egregious now than ever – but it also can work wonders unmatched by other economic systems… The American process has not always been pretty – our country has forever had many scoundrels and promoters who seek to take advantage of those who mistakenly trust them with their savings. But even with such malfeasance – which remains in full force today – and also much deployment of capital that eventually floundered because of brutal competition or disruptive innovation, the savings of Americans has delivered a quantity and quality of output beyond the dreams of any colonist.” The 94 year-old Berkshire Hathaway CEO says it won’t be long before he ends his historic 60-year tenure at the firm. “At 94, it won’t be long before Greg Abel replaces me as CEO and will be writing the annual letters… We are impartial in our choice of equity vehicles, investing in either variety based upon where we can best deploy your (and my family’s) savings. Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities.

Analys Weigh In,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/could-this-0-00020-token-eclipse-solana-and-ripples-early-success-analys-weigh-in/,"As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve in 2025, THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN has emerged as a potential game-changer, currently priced at $0.20. This Trump-inspired memecoin has captured significant attention, raising over $3 million in its presale phase. To understand its potential, let’s compare it to the early success stories of Solana and Ripple, two established players in the crypto space. Historical Growth Analysis: Solana (SOL) Solana has been a solid performer in the crypto landscape, known for its high-speed transactions and low fees. Its dual-layer consensus system, combining Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of History (PoH), allows for high throughput and low latency. This technological edge has made Solana a preferred platform for DeFi, NFT marketplaces, and gaming applications. Solana’s growth has been impressive, with its price reaching $219.47 and a 24-hour trading volume of $3.25 billion. The network’s ability to handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) under optimal conditions has positioned it as a strong competitor in the high-throughput blockchain space. Historical Growth Analysis: Ripple (XRP) Ripple has focused on revolutionizing cross-border payments, partnering with over 300 financial institutions globally. Its XRP Ledger processes 1,500 TPS, with transactions settling in 3-5 seconds at a cost of around $0.0002 per transaction. Despite facing regulatory challenges, including an ongoing legal battle with the SEC, Ripple has maintained its position as a leader in the payments sector. The outcome of its legal issues could significantly impact its adoption within institutional finance. THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN: The Trending Memecoin Set To Explode ACT FAST! USE PROMO CODE MAGA50X NOW AND CLAIM YOUR 50% EXTRA BONUS! THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN has shown remarkable potential, with its presale raising $3,076,115.19. Currently priced at $0.0001978 per token, it’s set to list at $0.007, indicating substantial growth potential. Key factors driving THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN’s potential include: A limited supply of 100 billion tokens, creating scarcity Strong community backing with over 60,000 supporters Unique blend of political branding and crypto innovation Analysts predict that THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN could reach $1 in 2025, potentially delivering significant returns for early investors. Comparative Market Potential While Solana and Ripple have established themselves in specific niches – Solana in high-performance blockchain applications and Ripple in cross-border payments – THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN is positioning itself as a community-driven, politically charged token with broad appeal. The current market environment, characterized by increasing regulatory clarity and institutional adoption, could benefit all three tokens. However, MAGACOIN’s unique positioning and viral potential could lead to explosive growth similar to or surpassing the early days of Solana and Ripple. Don’t Miss the Rise of THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN – Invest at $0.00020 Today! THE OFFICIAL MAGACOIN presents a unique opportunity in the evolving crypto landscape of 2025. With its strong community support, limited supply, and potential for viral growth, it could eclipse the early success of both Solana and Ripple. The token’s current price of $0.20 offers an attractive entry point for investors seeking high-growth potential.

SHIB’s technical indicators have analysts debating a potential rally, while LTC is navigating a key price point. BlockDAG, having raised over $197 million and sold 18.5 billion coins in its presale, is making waves in the Web3 space, attracting a massive influx of developer talent through its HackerEarth partnership. This article explores these exciting developments, providing insights into the Shiba Inu breakout forecast, Litecoin’s potential, and BlockDAG’s ambitious vision for the future of decentralized technology. Shiba Inu Breakout Forecast: A 23% Surge on the Horizon? The Shiba Inu breakout forecast is a major topic among traders following the coin’s earlier price climb. A subsequent dip has raised questions about the forecast’s validity. However, some technical observers highlight a golden cross formation on the daily chart, a potentially bullish signal. The Shiba Inu breakout forecast also considers a key Fibonacci retracement level where the coin found support. A prior golden cross event led to a substantial price increase, prompting speculation about a possible 23% rally. The Shiba Inu breakout forecast is being closely watched by many in the crypto community. Litecoin Price Trends: Targeting $140 and Beyond? The Litecoin (LTC) price prediction is attracting attention as the coin holds above $126, a level some view as a springboard for further gains. Some analysts suggest that breaking through this resistance could propel LTC toward $140 or higher, particularly given improving market sentiment related to regulatory clarity. Expert LTC price predictions point to potential higher targets if trading volume remains robust. However, mixed indicators have led to some caution among traders. A symmetrical triangle pattern on daily charts adds to the uncertainty. Upcoming ETF news could also impact Litecoin’s outlook, with the possibility of reaching $200 if conditions are favorable. BlockDAG x HackerEarth: Building the Next Generation of Web3 BlockDAG’s partnership with HackerEarth is creating significant excitement. By hosting global hackathons, BlockDAG is engaging over 10,000 developers. This initiative highlights BlockDAG’s commitment to building a vibrant Web3 ecosystem. With over $197 million raised and 18.5 billion coins sold, BlockDAG’s presale is demonstrating incredible momentum. Early participants have seen substantial returns, and there is talk of even greater returns in the future. These hackathons are not just for show. BlockDAG aims to be the leading developer-friendly Layer 1 platform, facilitating the creation of over 200 new Web3 projects across various sectors. This focus on developer engagement is expected to drive innovation, resulting in dApps tailored to specific markets and industries. BlockDAG’s leadership emphasizes the crucial role of the HackerEarth partnership in attracting top-tier talent. Localized events ensure that developers from all regions have the chance to contribute to the Web3 revolution. BlockDAG’s presale success reflects the project’s growing community and potential for mainstream adoption. With its focus on scalability, developer experience, and real-world applications, BlockDAG is positioning itself as a key player in the blockchain arena. A Quick Recap Traders are carefully observing market trends, including the Shiba Inu breakout forecast. The coin’s earlier price surge has sparked discussions about the potential for another upward move. Litecoin’s price prediction is also in focus as the coin consolidates above a key level, with analysts speculating about a push toward higher targets. BlockDAG’s collaboration with HackerEarth is expected to accelerate Web3 development.

Franklin Templeton’s Franklin Crypto Index ETF (EZPZ) has attracted around $2.5 million in net assets since launching on Feb. 20, while Hashdex’s Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF (NCIQ) has gathered just over $1 million since its Feb. 14 debut. By comparison, Franklin Templeton’s spot Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) saw significantly higher interest, pulling in approximately $50 million on its first day in January 2024, with Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) reaching nearly $240 million on its debut. Diversification Limits and Regulatory Barriers The two ETFs aim to provide investors with exposure to a diverse crypto index. However, due to regulatory restrictions, they currently hold only Bitcoin and Ether, which dominate their portfolios. The hope is to expand to other cryptocurrencies pending regulatory approval.

According to data provided by Binance and analyzed by CryptoQuant, the number of Binance Pay users tripled from the previous year, reaching 41.7 million. This rapid adoption highlights the increasing role of crypto in everyday transactions. Stablecoins Lead the Charge The total transaction volume processed through Binance Pay in 2024 stood at $72.4 billion, the report found. This is a notable rise from $2.5 billion in 2021. Stablecoins, particularly Tether (USDT), dominated Binance Pay transactions as it accounted for 80% of the total payment volume, which equated to $57 billion. Top crypto assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Binance Coin (BNB) followed suit, contributing $6.6 billion, $2.4 billion, and $2.2 billion, respectively, and represented 9%, 3%, and 3% of the total transaction value. Another popular stablecoin, USD Coin (USDC), exhibited notable year-over-year growth, with a 1,338% increase in transaction count and a 48% rise in transaction volume. Broader market trends indicate a rise in high-frequency token transactions on Binance Pay, with Solana (SOL) leading the surge. In fact, CryptoQuant found that SOL payments reached $724 million in 2024 and represented a 656% year-over-year increase. During the same period, Bitcoin transactions rose by 73% to $6.6 billion, while Ethereum payments grew by 69% to $2.4 billion. USDC and BNB also recorded notable growth, increasing by 48% and 29%, respectively. Binance Pay’ s expansion aligns with the overall growth of the crypto market and Binance’s increasing role in facilitating transactions. This trend is further validated by a significant rise in Binance’s cryptocurrency reserves. The USD value of its Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, and USDC reserves exceeded $100 billion in 2024, marking a 137% increase from the start of the year when reserves stood at $43 billion. The increasing use of Binance Pay reflects a larger global trend as cryptocurrency ownership continues to rise. Crypto Adoption Global cryptocurrency ownership witnessed a 13% increase in 2024, rising from 583 million in January to 659 million in December, according to a report by Crypto.com. Bitcoin ownership grew by 13.1%, reaching 337 million users and accounting for over 51% of all crypto owners. Ethereum saw a 13.6% increase, with owners rising from 125 million to 142 million, and represented 21.7% of global ownership. Additionally, between 300,000 and 1.2 million people may have invested in BTC through US spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Institutional interest and pro-crypto policies from US President-elect Donald Trump were major factors driving BTC adoption. The report observed that ETH’s growth was fueled by Ethereum Layer 2 network rallies following the Dencun upgrade and the launch of spot Ethereum ETFs, which contributed to increased investor participation.

If this happens, we could see XRP usage skyrocket as more financial institutions jump on board, which might drive up its price significantly – we’ll check it out in detail below. While XRP is bringing changes in traditional finance, PlutoChain could bring new functionalities in the Bitcoin space. Their hybrid L2 technology could give Bitcoin’s ecosystem a serious upgrade in the coming weeks. Let’s check out the details. XRP Price Prediction: Japanese Banks’ XRP Adoption Could Signal Major Price Movement – Is $10 on the Horizon? Japan’s financial sector might be on the verge of a major shift toward XRP adoption. SBI Group’s leader Yoshitaka Kitao envisions XRP revolutionizing how Japan’s migrant workers send money home, making transfers faster and cheaper. Industry insiders suggest a massive wave of adoption is building, with potentially 80% of Japanese banks considering XRP integration. This could dramatically boost both trading activity and market liquidity as banks tap into XRP for international transfers. The ripple effect could spread beyond Japan’s borders – if other Asian financial hubs follow suit, we might see unprecedented demand for XRP. Market analyst Farshad Rouhani has set an ambitious target, suggesting XRP could break $10 in early 2025 as Japanese banks roll out XRP-based payment systems. PlutoChain’s Hybrid Layer-2 Solution Could Transform Bitcoin’s Ecosystem Bitcoin continues to face challenges with its core infrastructure – users often encounter lengthy transaction times, high fees, and network bottlenecks that could limit its mainstream adoption. These scaling issues might become even more pressing as usage grows. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could offer a solution through its hybrid Layer-2 architecture that potentially works in parallel with Bitcoin’s main chain. By redirecting transaction traffic to its network, PlutoChain might significantly reduce fees and ease congestion, while potentially solving Bitcoin’s long-standing scalability challenges. The speed difference could be transformative. While Bitcoin typically requires 10 minutes to process blocks, trailing behind networks like Ethereum and Solana, PlutoChain’s Layer-2 solution might achieve block times of approximately 2 seconds. This improvement could enable faster smart contract execution while maintaining the robust security guarantees of Bitcoin’s network. A key feature of PlutoChain is its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. This feature could create a bridge between Bitcoin and the vast ecosystem of Ethereum-based applications. Projects focused on decentralized finance, NFT marketplaces, and emerging AI applications might soon flourish within Bitcoin’s ecosystem, potentially breathing new life into the network. Early performance indicators appear promising – testnet results show PlutoChain could process up to 43,200 transactions per day without experiencing slowdowns, suggesting robust scalability potential. Security is important in PlutoChain’s development approach. The project has undergone comprehensive audits from respected firms including SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi . Regular stress testing could help ensure the network maintains reliability even under heavy load conditions. Community governance stands as another cornerstone of the project. Through its decentralized governance model, PlutoChain could empower users to actively participate in the network’s evolution. Community members might propose changes and vote on crucial protocol decisions, potentially creating a more democratic and user-driven development process. The Bottom Line XRP’s momentum in Japanese banking could drive major price movements, while PlutoChain could gain traction as a potential upgrade in the Bitcoin ecosystem. By tackling Bitcoin’s core challenges with its hybrid Layer-2 solution, this project might revolutionize how we use the world’s largest digital asset – potentially offering faster transactions and lower fees while maintaining Bitcoin’s legendary security. ——- The information in this article does not represent financial or investment advice.

Their discussion about a potential national XRP reserve has ignited speculation – could this be the catalyst to propel XRP to $30? Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could be interesting to watch because of its innovative hybrid Layer-2 solution for Bitcoin. Designed to tackle Bitcoin’s long-standing issues like sluggish transaction speeds and limited scalability, this project could redefine Bitcoin as we know it. Let’s check out the details. XRP Is Showing Great Potential For a $30 Rally – What Are Analysts Saying? XRP is making noise in the crypto community with whispers of a potential $30 price surge, fueled by reported discussions between Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and President Donald Trump. It’s currently trading at $2.73 showing great potential for a breakout, and this high-profile chatter could be the match to light the fuse. XRP 7-day chart, Source: Binance Technically, XRP’s flexing strength, sitting below the 200-day EMA – a bullish bedrock. Resistance at $2.65 and $3.00 is in its crosshairs, and the RSI at 36 approaching oversold territory, a potential short-term bounce. The volume’s simmered to $4.2 billion daily from January’s $10 billion peak, but a Trump-Ripple bombshell could unleash a torrent of buying. A bullish pennant on the daily chart screams breakout potential – $3.66 could fall fast, paving the way to double digits. Historically, XRP thrives on regulatory clarity; a friendly nod from Trump could mirror 2017’s epic rally . Analysts are all-in on this bullish wave. DeepSeek AI model predicts that XRP could skyrocket to $30 in 2025, driven by increased institutional adoption and potential market share in global foreign exchange. On the other hand, CoinCodex experts indicate that XRP could reach as high as $4.24 by April 2025, based on historical data and market trends – significantly lower than the previous prediction but still promising. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Could Transform Bitcoin Into a Hub For Development and Innovation – New Layer-2 Blockchain Offers Smart Contracts and EVM Compatibility PlutoChain ($PLUTO) emerges as a hybrid Layer-2 blockchain with the potential to redefine Bitcoin’s role in the crypto ecosystem. Unlike Bitcoin’s base layer, which excels in security but lags in speed, this project could deliver an impressive upgrade. It offers a block time of 2 seconds compared to Bitcoin’s standard 10 minutes and scales to handle over 43,200 transactions per day, per testnet results. This leap in performance could position Bitcoin as a dynamic platform, not just a passive asset, appealing to enthusiasts eager for broader utility. Developers stand at the forefront of this shift. PlutoChain equips Bitcoin with smart contracts, unlocking the ability to build sophisticated decentralized applications directly on its network. Its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility adds another layer of appeal, enabling developers to seamlessly adapt Ethereum projects for Bitcoin’s infrastructure. This cross-chain potential could streamline workflows and inspire novel solutions, while users benefit from swift, low-fee transactions and access to innovative tools, all underpinned by Bitcoin’s reliability. For the DeFi community, PlutoChain offers a fresh angle. Bitcoin’s DeFi footprint remains minimal next to Ethereum’s and Solana’s. By weaving DeFi capabilities into Bitcoin, such as lending protocols and liquidity pools, PlutoChain could elevate and potentially challenge Ethereum or Solana’s established networks. Security holds firm as a cornerstone. PlutoChain has cleared audits from respected names like SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi , validating its technical integrity. Beyond that, its decentralized governance structure invites community members to shape the project’s future through Discord -based voting, ensuring decisions reflect community priorities and maintain accountability. PlutoChain’s vision taps into Bitcoin’s untapped potential, blending speed, scalability, and programmability. It hands developers a powerful canvas to innovate and users a more versatile network to explore. Conclusion XRP’s potential surge to $30 is gaining traction following discussions between Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Donald Trump, with speculation around a national XRP reserve adding fuel to the rally. Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could expand Bitcoin’s capabilities with its hybrid Layer-2 solution, enabling smart contracts, faster transactions, and DeFi integration. By merging Bitcoin’s security with Ethereum-like functionality, it could lead the way in the blockchain industry. ——- Please keep in mind that this article is not financial advice.

40702703,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=680672,1740262834,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40702703.jpeg,mETH Protocol and Tether lead campaign to freeze Bybit hacker’s bounty,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/meth-protocol-tether-freeze-bybit-hackers/,"The cryptocurrency space was ripe for a black swan event, and one promptly presented itself with the $1.4 billion Bybit hack. However, unlike previous debacles that led to near-total collapses, the industry has managed this episode fairly well—further highlighting the maturity of the digital asset space. In what many are calling the biggest crypto hack of all time, Bybit lost more than $1.4 billion in ETH and stETH early Friday. An investigation is ongoing, however, according to prominent on-chain sleuth ZachXBT, it is highly likely North Korea’s Lazarus group was behind the hack thanks to patterns consistent with their MO. After news of the hack spread, there was initial panic in the markets as Bybit users rushed to get their funds off the CEX, reminded all too well of how FTX folded following a series of panic withdrawals. Fortunately, it did not take long for order to be restored, and the crypto community has shown its resilience and togetherness after the early sensationalism that followed the big headline. mETH protocol joins Binance, others in supporting Bybit Shortly after news got out about the hack, mETH Protocol, a decentralized, permissionless platform built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to stake their ETH and receive liquid staking tokens, known as mETH, released a post-mortem of the hack. The report revealed that the attacker executed multiple transactions to move assets off the platform. According to mETH’s report, 8,000 mETH were swapped for ETH across three transactions via a DEX, and a 15,000 cmETH withdrawal was initiated via mETH Protocol. However, it did not allow the hackers to complete the transaction. The hackers would have gotten away with the funds if not for the protocol’s security measures, which include an 8-hour withdrawal delay built into the protocol to prevent the immediate withdrawal of cmETH. The protocol also blacklisted the exploiter’s address, reducing the cmETH liquidity on Mantle Network and the recovery of about 15,000 cmETH from the exploiter’s address to a recovery address, reinstating the integrity of cmETH supply. Aside from the mETH Protocol, other notable groups in crypto that have stepped up to help include Binance and Tether. On Friday, Paolo Ardoino, the CEO of Tether, revealed his firm had frozen $181,000 worth of the UDST linked to the stolen Bybit funds, thanks to the help of ZachXBT. “Might not be much but it’s honest work,” Ardoino wrote on X. “We keep monitoring.” On Binance’s part, it chose to provide a bridge loan to Bybit so that it can continue to process client withdrawals without delay, ensuring that users can access their funds despite the hack. Bitget has also provided a 64,452 ETH loan to Bybit, and MEXC transferred 12,652 stETH to Bybit’s cold wallet as a sign of solidarity. By now, it is clear that Bybit has weathered the storm from the attack. Following the breach, the firm confirmed that withdrawals were still active but warned that some users might experience delays due to network congestion. Despite the warning, Bybit was able to process 70% of the withdrawal requests successfully, and efforts are underway to address the remaining backlog. Now that the worst has passed, the company is focusing on recovery. On Saturday, Bybit stated it would offer 10% of recovered funds—up to $140 million—to any on-chain security experts who could help the firm get the stolen assets back. In a statement, Bybit co-founder and CEO Ben Zhou highlighted the show of solidarity from the space and promised it was not taken for granted. “We have shared in a dark moment of crypto history, and we’ve proven we are better than the malicious actors,” Zhou said. “We want to officially reward our community who lent us their expertise, experience, and support through the Recovery Bounty Program, and our efforts to make this difficult lesson a valuable one does not stop here.” Ben also noted that the hackers are moving some of the funds to Chainflip.io as a bridge to convert into BTC. He shared an SOS to any bridges with the capacity to freeze or even recover the funds stolen from his exchange, saying “If you are a bridge, Please help us to block and prevent further conversion to other chains.” Projects that have the potential to join the asset-freezing effort According to reports, most of the stolen funds are in native Ethereum, which is not easy to recover since it lacks a centralized freezing mechanism. About 8,000–15,000 mETH and approximately 181,000 USDT were also stolen. While Bybit pursues justice, onlookers have urged more entities currently sitting on the sidelines to join the effort by freezing the assets of the hackers. Some other projects people are expecting to take action include Lido (stETH) and Ethereum (ETH). Lido is a major liquid staking protocol and the issuer of stETH (Staked ETH). It could help by blacklisting stETH addresses, but this might only happen if it is pressured by Bybit or regulators. Also, its decentralized nature makes swift action less likely unless the effort is spearheaded by exchanges or law enforcement. While native ETH cannot be frozen by a single entity because of the chain’s decentralization, a hard fork or rollback could in theory invalidate the stolen funds. This was done once in 2016 when there was a DAO hack. It would require consensus from miners, nodes, and the community. While thought leaders like Arthur Hayes have been talking about the possibility of an Ethereum rollback, given the hack’s scale, there has been no official announcement, and the community’s willingness to do such a thing is uncertain. If there is no overwhelming support from the community, a rollback is unlikely to happen, and blacklisting at the protocol level isn’t feasible, although exchanges could tag and block exploiter addresses. Should the hackers also make the mistake of swapping the stolen ETH into other ERC-20 tokens like USDC, those projects have the ability to freeze funds as long as their contracts permit it. Circle (USDC) has been known to freeze stolen funds in the past, however in those cases, significant USDC had been lost. That is not the case this time. Some analysts are convinced the hackers will eventually convert the ETH to ERC-20 tokens before moving it to BTC and finally fiat via Asian exchanges.

Although it has a current price of $176 , according to CoinGecko, experts say this rise might happen as a result of USD/GBP exchange rates shift. Investors are watching closely because these currency changes can influence SOL’s growth. Meanwhile, Panshibi , a new meme coin, shines as a top crypto pick. Its presale, with only 30 days left, has already raised over $1,000,000. This article explores how USD/GBP fluctuations will push SOL’s price and why Panshibi is gaining attention in the cryptocurrency world today. USD/GBP Swings Push SOL Toward $375 Milestone Based on data from CoinMarketcap , Solana (SOL) trades at approximately $176 on February 21, 2025. Now, experts predict it could reach $375 soon due to the influence of swings in the USD/GBP exchange rate. The rate compares the US dollar to the British pound and its changes affect cryptocurrency prices globally. When the USD strengthens against the GBP, crypto often becomes more appealing to investors using pounds, boosting demand for coins like SOL. SOL’s price has been steady, hovering between $170 and $200 over the past week, with a market cap of about $85.57 billion . Its blockchain is known for fast transactions up to 65,000 per second and low fees of $0.0025 per transaction on an average, according to Solana’s official site. These strengths make it a top crypto pick among developers and investors, supporting its growth. Also, some analysts have noted SOL’s potential to double in value soon, driven by these currency dynamics and its solid technology. Unlike some coins, SOL’s rise is backed by real use in decentralized apps and finance. However, the market remains unpredictable. If the USD/GBP stabilizes, SOL’s climb might slow. Still, with its current trajectory and global economic factors at play, reaching $375 seems within reach. Investors are keeping a close eye on exchange rates, knowing they could push SOL, a top crypto pick even higher in the coming weeks. Panshibi’s Final 30 Days: A Rising Star in Crypto Panshibi, a new meme coin, is in the spotlight as a top crypto pick with just 30 days left in its presale as of February 22, 2025. It has raised over $1,000,000 at stage 4 of the presale with a token price of $0.005. This success shows strong interest from investors. Unlike many meme coins, Panshibi blends fun with real utility, offering AI features and Social-Fi rewards. The coin’s appeal comes from its community focus and unique design. Panshibi is set to offer a 1200% increase during its presale and a 145,000% increase after its launch. This has attracted investors who want profit and stability. It also plans to list on major exchanges, boosting its visibility. With 720 million tokens in the presale already and a total supply of 1.2 billion, Panshibi allows investors to become early adopters. Since meme coins often rely on hype, Panshibi’s mix of innovation, tech and community sets it apart. Now, the final 30 days are critical. Early buyers could see big returns if it follows the path of coins like Shiba Inu, which soared after launch. With strong backing and a clear plan, Panshibi is set to be the top crypto pick for 2025. Conclusion Solana’s push toward $375 reflects how USD/GBP swings shape the crypto market. On other news, Panshibi emerges as a top crypto pick with its presale nearing its end with less than 30 days left. After the launch, Panshibi will list on Uniswap and multiple CEXs. Don’t miss out on this lifetime opportunity, join Panshibi’s presale now and be part of its innovation before it’s too late.

With a growing community, strategic tokenomics, and expanding utility, Pepeto stands out in a crowded market. Dogecoin Set the Standard #Dogecoin started as a joke but became a pioneer in the meme coin sector. Dogecoin attained widespread mainstream popularity because it developed both a powerful community structure and high levels of virality. Over time, Dogecoin gained utility through tipping, payments, and integrations with major businesses. The coin’s duration demonstrates that meme coins can endure longer than momentary speculation. Influential figures, including Elon Musk, contributed to Dogecoin growth. Despite its initial playful nature, Dogecoin remains a key player in the crypto space. Pepe Followed with a Fresh Approach The new investor base came to market through #Pepe because it incorporated contemporary meme-based design elements. Young investors received exposure to Pepe through their engagement with online communities and viral marketing. Users interested in Pepe pursued its deflationary framework because it presented investment benefits that were dissimilar to those of Dogecoin. These developments demonstrated how internet culture defines the future of meme coins as an investment opportunity. The market saw potential in Pepe, which led investors to value it significantly high. Pepe’s success confirmed that meme cryptocurrency investments survive through distinctive branding and restricted token availability mechanisms. Pepeto Leads with Innovation and Utility #Pepeto takes meme coins further by combining strong branding with real-world use cases.

DOGE meme coin eyes breakout as SEC reviews spot ETF filing Dogecoin (DOGE) is approaching a critical juncture, with technical indicators pointing to a potential 25% breakout. A symmetrical triangle pattern on the 1-hour chart suggests Dogecoin’s price is consolidating, preparing for a significant move. Analysts are closely watching whether Dogecoin surges higher or faces another downturn. According to Crypto Analyst Ali Martinez, the symmetrical triangle signals an impending breakout as Dogecoin’s price squeezes between trendlines. Meanwhile, the SEC has acknowledged Grayscale’s filing for a spot Dogecoin ETF, marking the beginning of its review process. If approved, the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust could bring Dogecoin to mainstream investment markets. The DOGE meme coin trades at $0.26, and analysts expect a rally to $1. Dogecoin is still a top crypto contender with growing institutional interest and technical momentum building. Dogwifhat (WIF) struggles below $1 after 87% drop Dogwifhat (WIF) was among the best cryptos to perform during the last market cycle, advancing 3,000% to an all-time high in March 2024. Dogwifhat was the largest meme coin in the Solana ecosystem and rapidly grew well-known, but it is now not among the top 100 cryptocurrencies. The downturn began in November 2024 and extended into 2025, with Dogwifhat plummeting 87% from its peak. On Feb. 3, 2025, Dogwifhat hit a low of $0.55 and struggled to recover. Currently, Dogwifhat trades at $0.60, sitting below the crucial $1 threshold needed to trigger bullish momentum. Despite its decline, Dogwifhat remains a key player in Solana’s meme coin sector. Analysts suggest that a break back above $1 could reignite investor interest, but until then, Dogwifhat faces an uncertain path in the volatile crypto market. 1Fuel (OFT): Cross-chain trading, AI tools, and exclusive bonuses 1Fuel (OFT) is transforming decentralized trading with its cross-chain compatibility, allowing seamless transactions across multiple blockchains.

However, this bullish dream ended almost immediately after it started as nearly $1.5 billion worth of ETH tokens were drained from the ByBit exchange. Ethereum, which traded as high as $2,840 earlier on Friday, February 21, dropped towards $2,600 on the back of news of the ByBit hack. Interestingly, recent on-chain data suggests that the altcoin’s price could still make its way to $4,000 before the end of this cycle. Could ETH Price Still Record A 60% Rally This Cycle? In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, an analyst with the pseudonym Crypto Sunmoon identified a particular bullish divergence that offers insight into the Ethereum price performance in the near future. This bullish observation is based on recent movements of ETH’s “taker buy/sell ratio” across all exchanges. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price On The Edge: Breakout Or Breakdown—What’s Next? This metric measures the taker buy and taker sell volumes for a specific cryptocurrency (Ethereum, in this case). When the taker buy/sell ratio is greater than one, it implies that the taker buy volume is higher than the taker sell volume. This is typically considered a bullish signal, indicating the willingness of investors to pay a higher price for an asset. On the contrary, a less-than-one taker buy/sell ratio indicates that sellers are overwhelming the buyers in the market. This scenario suggests that more sellers are willing to offload their assets at a lower price, signaling a bearish shift in investor sentiment. Crypto Sunmoon noted that the 100-day exponential moving average (EMA) of the Ethereum taker buy/sell ratio on all exchanges has been rising in recent weeks. The Ethereum price, on the other hand, has been declining since mid-December. According to the analyst, this divergence is positive, as it indicates that a bearish trend has ended and an upward trend could be starting. The last time this bullish divergence occurred, the Ethereum price traveled from beneath $2,500 to above $4,000 (over 60% rally). While investors would view a reclaim of $3,000 as a victory for Ethereum, history and this bullish divergence suggest that the altcoin’s price could still climb toward the $4,000 mark before the end of the current cycle. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Ethereum stands around $2,650, reflecting a nearly 4% decline in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: More Pain Ahead For Solana?

In what he categorized as the ELI5 explainer to non-technical community members, Beiko explained why a rollback is impossible. Historical Trend Behind Chain Rollback The conversations around potential Ethereum rollback followed the $1.4 billion Bybit hack . With over 401,000 ETH siphoned on-chain, top industry leaders are now advocating for a chain halt to reverse the transactions. According to Tim Beiko on X , the rollback trend is not a new trend. He returned to memory lane, noting that they started with Bitcoin in 2010. At the time, a client software minted 184 billion Bitcoins in block 74638. At the time, it was easy for Satoshi Nakamoto to deploy a software patch to address the bug. Also, TheDAO, an Ethereum protocol, suffered a hack in which bad actors siphoned approximately 15% of all ETH it had in custody. Luckily, at the time, there was a fail-safe system where funds withdrawn were frozen for 30 days before access was granted. This allowed the Ethereum developers to rollback the chain, creating a new chain. Tim Beiko noted that the updated chain at the time became Ethereum, while the old chain remained Ethereum Classic. Why is Ethereum Rollback Impossible? In justifying why it is impossible to reverse the transactions on the Ethereum Block that led to the hack, Beiko pointed out the complexity of the current ETH chain. Unlike Bitcoin in 2010, which had limited adoption and a price of $0.07, Ethereum powers real-world economic transactions. The researcher said attempting to roll back the transaction will significantly affect the ecosystem. In addition, he noted that the Lazarus Group behind the hack had moved the Ethereum funds, aligning with earlier reports. Unlike TheDAO, Beiko pointed out the complications in rolling back these transactions. Lastly, he identified the opposition to the rollback of Ethereum in 2018 in a situation related to Parity’s multisig wallet. Despite the over 500,000 Ethereum involved in the case, developers within the ecosystem did not agree to the move. The Ethereum Pectra Upgrade Challenge While Tim Beiko did not highlight this, the protocol is expecting the Pectra upgrade to launch in April. This upgrade, which has been under development for over a year, is set to enter the testing phase in the coming week. Some experts are concerned that the chain rollback plans may also impact the Pectra upgrade. The Ethereum network roadmap is on track; however, industry backlash on the siphoned funds has yet to be resolved.

Ripple (XRP) has long been a key player in cross-border transactions, gaining institutional adoption despite regulatory uncertainties. However, new projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are emerging with strong utility and fresh opportunities, drawing attention from early investors. Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a major force in decentralized finance (DeFi), offering a lending platform where users can supply assets, borrow funds, and earn passive income. Unlike XRP, which is primarily focused on payments, MUTM brings a self-sustaining ecosystem with real financial applications. With over $1 million raised in its presale and Phase 1 nearly sold out, analysts are beginning to view Mutuum Finance as a high-upside opportunity with strong fundamentals backing its long-term growth. Ripple (XRP) XRP has remained a strong contender in the crypto market, largely due to its role in facilitating fast and low-cost cross-border transactions. Its adoption among financial institutions has positioned it as a promising asset, and some analysts believe it could eventually reach $5. However, the timeline for such growth remains uncertain, as XRP’s price movements have been influenced by regulatory challenges and market fluctuations. While its long-term potential is still debated, investors looking for faster returns are exploring alternatives like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which offers a dynamic ecosystem with immediate utility and a structured growth strategy. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly establishing itself as a strong contender in decentralized finance (DeFi), attracting both experienced investors and newcomers seeking high-growth opportunities. Unlike many early-stage projects, Mutuum Finance provides tangible financial utility through its decentralized lending protocol. Users can supply assets to earn passive income or borrow funds while keeping their holdings intact, creating a sustainable economic model that drives continuous demand for the MUTM token. These real-world applications set it apart from speculative tokens and position it for long-term success. The project’s presale has already demonstrated remarkable traction, raising over $1,040,000 in a short time while surpassing 2,200 holders. With more than 97% of Phase 1 tokens sold out, early investors are securing MUTM at $0.01 before the next price increase. Analysts point to this rapid fundraising as a key indicator of growing confidence in the project. As more participants enter the ecosystem and upcoming exchange listings expand accessibility, many believe Mutuum Finance is positioned for exponential growth. Mutuum Finance’s long-term value is further reinforced by its ecosystem utilities, which are designed to create sustained demand and price appreciation. The integration of an overcollateralized stablecoin ensures stability in lending and borrowing, while the buy-and-distribute mechanism continuously supports token demand by using platform revenue to repurchase MUTM from the market. This self-sustaining approach fosters price stability and encourages long-term holding, benefiting both lenders and borrowers. Mutuum Finance’s overcollateralized stablecoin operates on the Ethereum network, maintaining a 1:1 backing with on-chain collateral. This ensures that every minted token is fully secured, allowing users to borrow stable-value assets while keeping their crypto holdings intact. When users lock assets as collateral, they can generate the stablecoin, which is later burned upon loan repayment or liquidation. This process stabilizes supply and demand, offering a transparent and decentralized alternative to traditional stablecoins while improving liquidity within the platform’s lending ecosystem. With a clear roadmap, growing adoption, and strong early-stage momentum, Mutuum Finance is gaining recognition as one of the most promising DeFi projects of 2025. Analysts predict that as adoption increases and the platform scales, MUTM’s value will surge by 4,500%, offering significant upside potential for early investors. Those who recognize its growth potential now have the opportunity to secure a position before the project gains widespread market attention.

XRP – Facilitating Global Financial Transactions XRP continues to be influential in the crypto sphere, especially for its efficiency in handling large-scale, low-cost transactions across borders. Supported by numerous financial institutions, XRP recently gained attention due to speculation about the SEC potentially dropping its lawsuit against Ripple, sparking optimism. As financial infrastructures more fully embrace blockchain, XRP emerges as a top contender among the best crypto coins to buy now, thanks to its practical applications in global finance. Its capability for quick, cost-effective transactions positions it well for expanded use.

Beginning February 17, Jupiter will dedicate 50% of protocol fees to repurchase and lock JUP tokens for three years, bolstering long-term value and stability. With a transparent buyback dashboard, Jupiter is strategically poised for continued growth in the DeFi sector. The current price of JUP is $0.00073409, with the buyback strategy expected to significantly enhance its market value moving forward. Final Words!

XRP remains a top choice for cross-border payments, and Jupiter’s strategic buyback plan positions it as a key player in decentralized exchanges. For investors exploring the best crypto coins to buy now , these assets offer promising avenues for both immediate and long-term growth.

This comes after several recent events suggest a significant change in how the agency handles crypto rules. OpenSea Lawsuit End: New Era for Crypto Oversight? OpenSea has been under investigation since last year when it received a “Wells notice from the SEC. This is a formal warning that the regulatory agency might take legal action. The SEC believed some NFTs on OpenSea could be unregistered securities. This raised questions about how digital collectibles fit into existing laws. Meanwhile, the SEC decided to drop the case against OpenSea shortly after it announced plans to dismiss its lawsuit against Coinbase. These back-to-back decisions suggest the agency is easing its tough approach to crypto, which was what the former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s leadership was known for. Under new leadership, the SEC is changing its strategy. Acting Chairman Mark T. Uyeda has put Commissioner Hester Peirce, a strong supporter of fair crypto rules, in charge of a new unit called the Crypto Task Force. This task force’s role is to work on clearer regulations and communicate directly with crypto companies. OpenSea Victory and the Future of NFT Regulation For OpenSea, the SEC’s decision removes a big legal risk. CEO Devin Finzer criticized the investigation, saying it was unfair to artists and creators. Now that the case is closed, OpenSea can focus on its plans, including the launch of its SEA token airdrop, which will be available to U.S. users. The company hinted at the airdrop after recently introducing its new OS2 platform . Crypto airdrops have always been in a legal gray area. In September, members of Congress asked the SEC to clarify their rules, saying the uncertainty hurts U.S. investors. With the SEC changing its approach, future airdrops and NFT marketplaces may face fewer legal issues. SEC’s Changing Stance on Crypto Cases This is not the first time the SEC has stepped back from a crypto investigation. Last year, it looked into Paxos’ BUSD stablecoin, saying it might be a security, but later dropped the case. The SEC also ended its investigation into Ethereum’s switch to proof-of-stake. Now, with Peirce’s task force working with companies on issues like staking ETFs, the SEC seems more focused on crypto advancements. This marks a shift from its previous strict enforcement approach.

Details,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-ceo-stresses-major-shift-end-of-xrp-case-is-near-details/,"Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently shared his perspective on the SEC’s regulatory stance, suggesting that the agency under its current leadership is moving away from the enforcement-driven policies of the previous administration. Acknowledging the impatience of many within the crypto community, he noted that the SEC appears to be taking a different approach, signaling a potential shift in regulatory strategy. His statement quickly gained traction among XRP supporters and the broader cryptocurrency industry, sparking speculation about the potential resolution of the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit. Many see this as a sign that the prolonged legal battle, which began in December 2020, could be approaching its conclusion. BREAKING: CEO of @Ripple – Brad Garlinghouse says: “This SEC has demonstrated a clear interest in moving on quickly (!) from the failed regulation by enforcement policies of the last Administration.” The End Of The SEC v. RIPPLE Case Is Near! #XRP pic.twitter.com/GrqTukv7OB — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) February 21, 2025 Community Reactions and Speculation The response from the crypto community was immediate. X user JackTheRippler shared Garlinghouse’s statement, emphasizing its significance by framing it as a major development. His post suggested that the SEC is moving from its previous regulatory approach, fueling optimism among XRP enthusiasts. Not everyone was convinced. Kailas Worlds expressed skepticism, questioning why there had been no official dismissal of the lawsuit. He called for “less talk, more action,” reflecting the impatience of many XRP supporters waiting for a resolution for years. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 On the other hand, TraderJoe struck a more optimistic tone. He pointed out that the U.S. crypto market is expanding rapidly and suggested that this regulatory shift could pave the way for greater institutional adoption of XRP. According to him, once the lawsuit is resolved, XRP could see a significant increase in usage and market activity. Implications of a Regulatory Shift Garlinghouse’s remarks imply that the SEC may be re-evaluating its regulatory approach. The enforcement-heavy tactics of the previous administration have faced widespread criticism from industry leaders and policymakers, who argue that such an approach has created uncertainty rather than clarity. If the SEC is indeed adopting a more structured and transparent regulatory framework, this could be a welcome change for blockchain companies operating in the U.S. For Ripple and XRP, the potential shift raises questions about the lawsuit’s future. If the SEC truly intends to “move on quickly,” as Garlinghouse hinted, this could mean an openness to resolving outstanding enforcement actions rather than prolonging them. However, no official confirmation has been provided regarding a resolution, leaving the community in anticipation.

With the market’s constant ebb and flow, it’s easy to miss out on potential goldmines. Let’s dive into two top crypto assets : one that might’ve sailed past you—Near Protocol—and another that’s still docked, waiting for you to hop on board—Qubetics. Near Protocol: The One That Got Away Remember when Bitcoin was just a whisper among tech geeks? Those who got in early are probably lounging on private islands now. Near Protocol had a similar buzz. Launched to tackle scalability issues, it promised faster transactions and lower fees. But if you’re hearing about it now, you might’ve missed the boat. Back in January 2022, Near Protocol hit its all-time high at $20.44. Fast forward to today, and it’s trading around $3.58. That’s a significant drop, but hindsight’s 20/20, right? Analysts had high hopes, predicting it could reach $6.59 by 2025. But the crypto seas are unpredictable, and not all ships sail as expected. So, what happened? The market’s a wild beast. While Near Protocol offered innovative solutions, competition is fierce. Newer platforms emerged, each claiming to be the next big thing. If you didn’t jump on Near Protocol during its peak, you might feel like you missed out. But don’t beat yourself up; the crypto world is full of second chances. Qubetics: Your Ticket to the Next Big Thing Missed out on Near Protocol? Don’t sweat it. Qubetics is here, and it’s making waves. Imagine a world where your online privacy isn’t just a myth. Qubetics offers a decentralized VPN (dVPN) that ensures your data isn’t being hawked to the highest bidder. Traditional VPNs? They’re like using a screen door on a submarine. Centralized and prone to data leaks. Qubetics flips the script with its peer-to-peer network. No central authority means no single point of failure. Whether you’re a journalist dodging censorship or just someone who values their Netflix binge sessions without regional blocks, Qubetics has your back. But wait, there’s more. Qubetics isn’t just about privacy; it’s about opportunity. The crypto presale is in its 22nd stage, and folks are buzzing. Over 484 million tokens sold to more than 20,900 holders, raking in a cool $13.6 million. Right now, $TICS tokens are up for grabs at $0.08073 each. But don’t drag your feet; each stage lasts just seven days, with a 10% price bump every Sunday at midnight. Analysts are whispering sweet nothings about $TICS, predicting it could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale—a juicy 209.67% return on investment. And if the stars align? We might see $1 post-presale and even $15 after the mainnet launch. That’s some serious cheddar. Think about it. An investment of $7,500 today snags you about 92,887 $TICS tokens. If $TICS climbs to $1, you’re looking at $92,887. And if it moonshots to $10? That’s a whopping $928,870. Not too shabby for a day’s work. Interoperability: Bridging the Digital Divide Beyond the dVPN, Qubetics is all about interoperability. In plain English? Making sure different systems play nice together. Picture this: you’re a freelance graphic designer juggling multiple platforms—PayPal, Venmo, crypto wallets. It’s a headache. Qubetics streamlines this mess, allowing seamless transactions across various platforms. Or imagine a business owner dealing with suppliers overseas. Currency conversions, transfer fees, and delays are the norm. With Qubetics, transactions are swift, fees are slashed, and everyone’s happy. It’s like having a universal translator for your financial dealings. Don’t Let This Ship Sail Without You The crypto seas are choppy, and opportunities can slip through your fingers. Near Protocol might’ve been a missed chance, but Qubetics is anchored and ready. With its innovative solutions and a heating up presale, now’s the time to act. Head over to their official site and snag your $TICS tokens before the next price hike. Remember, in the world of crypto, fortune favors the bold. Don’t let this golden opportunity become another “what if.” For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is Qubetics? Qubetics is a decentralized platform offering a VPN service that ensures online privacy through a peer-to-peer network, eliminating centralized control. How can I purchase $TICS tokens? Visit the Qubetics presale page, select your preferred cryptocurrency for payment, enter the desired amount of $TICS tokens, and follow the prompts to complete your purchase. What are the benefits of using Qubetics’ dVPN? Unlike traditional VPNs, Qubetics’ dVPN offers enhanced privacy by operating on a decentralized network, making it resistant to censorship and data breaches. What is interoperability in the context of Qubetics? Interoperability refers to Qubetics’ ability to facilitate seamless transactions across different platforms and systems, simplifying processes for businesses and individuals. Why is there urgency in purchasing $TICS tokens now? The presale is structured in stages, with each stage lasting seven days and a 10% price increase at the end of each stage. Purchasing now secures a lower price before the next hike.

The interaction triggered a $5 billion capital inflow within hours. Binance Coin (BNB) Price Surges 6% amid Kanye West and CZ Chats Binance exchange native coin BNB has been subject to intense market volatility in recent days. Within hours of the Bybit exchange hack , Binance transferred 50,000 ETH to provide emergency support and liquidity for user withdrawals, which successfully helped ease panic and avoid systemic risks. BNB Price Action, Feb 22, 2025 | TradingView BNB price made rapid 6% recovery from Friday’s shock sell-off, as Billionaire rapper and fashion entrepreneur Kanye West, known for his controversial online statements, made enquiries about launching a new crypto project and called Changpeng Zhao’s attention in his latest series of cryptic posts on X (prev. Twitter). Kanye West’s Token Launch Enquiry with CZ Sparks Intense Speculation Kanye West, recognized for his unpredictable ventures in music, fashion, and politics, took to social media on February 22 to discuss cryptocurrency. In a series of posts, he shared screenshots of private messages debating whether to launch his own blockchain rather than simply creating a meme coin. West reposted a message from Mikey Shelton stating, “You are the brand. Whatever it is will do well. Some things are better than others. It’s about who you trust.” This suggested that West is considering a serious blockchain project rather than jumping onto meme coin trends. Another post showed a conversation with Edward, who advised him: “Using Cardano as an example, they had the Cardano token, a wallet system, a whitepaper, a roadmap website, etc. You could set up a similar structure.” Kanye West inquires about BNB | Feb 22, 2025 | Source: X.com/Kanyewest Adding to the speculation, Kanye recently followed Changpeng Zhao on X, making CZ the only person he follows. CZ responded humorously, posting: “DEX is so much harder to use…” further fueling rumors of a collaboration. West’s interest comes amid a growing wave of celebrity-driven crypto projects. In recent years, figures like Iggy Azalea, Caitlyn Jenner, and former NBA stars have launched their own tokens, with mixed results. BNB Price Forecast: $700 Breakout Imminent if CZ Talks with Ye Advance Further BNB price forecast chart suggests strong upside momentum, consolidating above key technical levels. The 12-hour chart shows BNB trading at $669.5, gaining 3.41% on the session. BNB Price Forecast | BNBUSD Bollinger Bands Expansion: The price is pressing against the upper band at $689.8, signaling increasing bullish pressure. A breakout above this level could propel BNB toward $700, particularly if discussions between Kanye and CZ sparks more speculative demand. Volume Delta Surge: Buying volume is outpacing selling pressure. A significant 24.48K increase in volume on the latest green candle aligns with a 5.35% price gain, indicating strong market participation. On-Balance Volume (OBV) Trend: OBV has flipped positive, confirming accumulation. Historically, such a shift precedes sustained rallies, making a retest of $700 likely. A rejection at $689.8 could trigger a short-term pullback to the middle Bollinger Band at $663.1, while the lower band at $636.5 serves as the last line of defense against a broader correction. For BNB to sustain its uptrend, it must establish firm support above $680. A failure to hold this level could invalidate the bullish outlook, leading to increased volatility.

TIA price has climbed 3.80% in the last 24 hours, but it’s still down 83.15% from a year ago. The market sentiment remains bearish, and Celestia is trading below key resistance levels. Meanwhile, FTX token is up 15% in a week as excitement builds around the exchange’s repayment plan, set to begin on February 18. Short-term momentum looks strong, but long-term uncertainty remains. While some tokens are struggling, BlockDAG is growing fast. Its TG Tap Miner now has over 200,000 users, proving to be one of the hottest play-to-earn opportunities. With BDAG projected to hit $1 in 2025, this free mining game is fueling the entire ecosystem, making BlockDAG a top crypto to buy in 2025. BlockDAG’s TG Tap Miner Crosses 200K Users—Why It’s a Game-Changer Mining crypto doesn’t have to be complicated, and BlockDAG’s TG Tap Miner proves it. With over 200,000 users, this Telegram-based game makes earning BDAG as easy as tapping a screen. Each session lets players earn Tap Points, which will convert into BDAG when the blockchain goes live. As BDAG’s price is projected to hit $1 in 2025, early participants are stacking up potential future rewards. The ease of use and growing adoption make BlockDAG’s ecosystem one of the most exciting developments in the space. The BlockDAG presale is another sign of its momentum, with over $197 million raised so far. BDAG is currently priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27, with 18.4 billion coins sold. With plans to list on 10+ major exchanges, the project is attracting serious attention. The presale’s rapid growth shows why many are considering BlockDAG a top crypto to buy in 2025, offering a chance to get in before the price surges. With both the TG Tap Miner and presale driving adoption, BlockDAG is building a strong foundation. The X1 Miner app has already surpassed 500,000 active users, adding to the network’s reach. As the launch approaches, BlockDAG continues to stand out as a top crypto to buy in 2025. Is a Rebound Coming? Latest TIA Price Update The TIA price has gained 3.80% in the last 24 hours, showing some short-term recovery, but the overall trend remains bearish. It is still down 35.92% in the past month and 83.15% over the past year, trading at $3.18. With key resistance at $3.10, $3.17, and $3.23, TIA needs a strong push to break higher. Analysts predict a possible jump to $3.99 by February 22, which would be a 29.66% increase, but sentiment remains weak, with 22 indicators bearish and only 4 bullish. Celestia hit an all-time high of $20.85 in February 2024, making the current TIA price a steep decline from its peak. Technical indicators show mixed signals, with some suggesting further downside. With market uncertainty still in play, breaking past resistance levels will be key for a potential recovery. Can the FTX Token Keep Climbing as Repayments Begin? The FTX token has jumped 15% in the past week, currently trading at $2.2172 after a 2.13% gain in the last 24 hours. The price surge comes as FTX prepares to start creditor repayments on February 18. Wallets with claims under $50,000 will reportedly receive 118% of their owed USD value within three business days. With this repayment plan in motion, speculation is building around whether FTT can push past key resistance levels at $2.8360 and $3.50. Despite recent gains, uncertainty remains. The 50/200-day EMA just recorded a Death Cross, a bearish signal that hints at potential downside. If FTX token breaks below $2.2050, it could fall toward $1.58. On the other hand, if bullish sentiment holds, analysts suggest a possible FTT rally to $5.50 this year, making the next few weeks critical for its direction. Summing Up TIA price is up 3.80% today but still struggling to recover from its 83.15% drop over the past year. Analysts predict a possible move to $3.99, but with sentiment still bearish, breaking resistance will be a challenge. Meanwhile, FTX token has surged 15% in a week, fueled by the exchange’s repayment plan starting February 18. With small creditors set to receive 118% of their claims, FTT is seeing renewed interest, though technical indicators remain mixed. While these tokens face uncertainty, BlockDAG is proving to be a top crypto to buy in 2025. With over 200,000 users tapping to earn BDAG and its presale surpassing $197 million, the ecosystem is expanding fast.

According to analysts at JPMorgan, there’s been a notable decline in institutional interest in the crypto industry, particularly through Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts. Institutional Demand Declines, Futures Market Signals Weakness Institutional investors have been a major primer for Bitcoin’s price rallies in the past year and they have been influential in Bitcoin’s break above the $100,000 mark. However, since breaking above this level, the Bitcoin price has failed to push further, which is a sign of a slowdown in institutional investments. Related Reading: Bitcoin Ready For ‘Take Off’—Analyst Reveals Key Signals This slowdown in institutional investments was confirmed by analysts at JPMorgan in a recent note to clients. One of the most pressing revelations from JPMorgan’s analysis is the apparent decline in the Bitcoin and Ethereum futures markets on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The bank’s research highlights a growing trend of backwardation, a scenario in which spot prices exceed futures prices. Typically, a healthy market sees futures contracts priced higher than the spot price due to the expectation of future growth. However, the current inversion suggests that institutional players remain hesitant, likely due to a lack of immediate bullish catalysts. “This is a negative development and indicative of demand weakness,” JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note to clients. “Lower demand from systematic and momentum-driven funds, such as CTAs, has also affected bitcoin and ether futures,” he added. Speaking of bullish catalysts, there has been a major slowdown in the euphoria surrounding crypto-positive developments from the new Trump administration in the US. Any supportive policies or regulatory reforms for the crypto industry are unlikely to take effect until the latter half of 2025. As such, Bitcoin and the rest of the market are currently stuck in limbo without any bullish catalysts and continued profit-taking. Allegations Of Market Manipulation Beyond the shifts in institutional sentiment, suspicions of artificial market suppression have gained traction within the crypto community. Industry leaders, including Samson Mow, CEO of Jan3, have voiced concerns that Bitcoin’s inability to gain sustained upward momentum above $100,000 appears “manufactured.” According to him, some large market participants are selling even as retail buyers are dollar-cost averaging and buying. These allegations are not new, as Bitcoin’s history has been punctuated by periods of suspected price manipulation by whales. The recent influx of more institutional investors even makes this price manipulation more possible than in the previous cycles.

Given the current trend, Bitcoin might continue consolidating around $100,000 in the short term, at least until the second half of 2025. However, long-term price targets from analysts for Bitcoin range from between $150,000 to $2 million.

Tokens under $1 often combine strong fundamentals with significant adoption potential, making them an appealing choice. With 2025 expected to be a pivotal year for digital assets, the top 4 altcoins under $1 are gaining momentum. Some of these projects are already making waves with key ecosystem upgrades, while others are leading the charge in Web3, payments, and blockchain innovation. For those seeking value and potential, these altcoins stand out as options worth considering. 1. Web3Bay – Reshaping E-Commerce with Blockchain Web3Bay is redefining online shopping by eliminating intermediaries and giving users full control over transactions. This decentralized marketplace allows buyers and sellers to interact seamlessly using crypto, with its native token, 3BAY, facilitating payments, rewards, and governance. Currently priced at $0.004562625, Web3Bay’s presale has raised over $1.5 million, with more than 375 million tokens sold. The structured presale model increases the token price by 15% per stage, setting the foundation for its launch price of $0.1959. Web3Bay goes beyond traditional e-commerce by integrating blockchain for secure, fee-free transactions while offering governance rights through a DAO. The roadmap for 2025 includes the expansion of crypto payment options, NFT-based commerce, and a transition to full decentralization. As one of the top 4 altcoins under $1 , Web3Bay stands out with practical utility and long-term growth prospects. 2. Cardano (ADA) – A Research-Backed Blockchain for the Future Cardano has built its reputation on a methodical and research-driven approach to blockchain development. Trading at $0.772737, ADA remains an attractive asset for investors looking for long-term blockchain projects with sustainability and scalability in mind. The network continues rolling out upgrades, with a focus on smart contracts, decentralized applications, and institutional adoption. Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, has expressed confidence in ADA’s potential, comparing its trajectory to that of Ethereum and XRP. The 2025 roadmap includes further decentralization, increased DeFi integrations, and expanding real-world applications. As one of the top 4 altcoins under $1 , Cardano’s measured, long-term approach positions it as a strong contender in blockchain development. 3. Stellar (XLM) – Enabling Fast, Global Transactions Stellar remains a dominant player in blockchain-based financial services, offering near-instant and low-cost cross-border transactions. With XLM trading at $0.345041, it provides an accessible entry point for those looking to invest in scalable blockchain infrastructure. Stellar’s ability to process transactions within 3 to 5 seconds, coupled with minimal fees, has positioned it as a preferred choice for businesses and individuals seeking efficient payment solutions. The network continues to expand its partnerships with fintech firms and financial institutions, reinforcing its real-world use cases. As adoption increases, Stellar’s role in the digital finance space strengthens. Among the top 4 altcoins under $1 , Stellar remains a strong option for those who see blockchain as a disruptor to traditional financial systems. 4. Tron (TRX) – Growing Its Role in DeFi Tron has steadily gained recognition for its expanding footprint in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. Currently priced at $0.242291, TRX has recorded a 2.65% gain recently, signaling resilience amid market fluctuations. With its blockchain optimized for speed and low fees, Tron is becoming an increasingly attractive platform for DeFi applications and entertainment-based blockchain services. Beyond its technical capabilities, Tron’s presence in the DeFi space continues to grow. It is frequently cited as a small-cap asset with the potential for significant returns under favorable market conditions. If the DeFi ecosystem expands further, Tron’s utility and adoption could increase, supporting its price growth. With these factors in play, TRX solidifies its position among the top 4 altcoins under $1 as a promising player in the evolving blockchain landscape. Key Highlights! Finding undervalued cryptocurrencies with high potential goes beyond just looking at low prices—it’s about identifying projects with strong fundamentals and meaningful use cases. The top 4 altcoins under $1 listed here bring distinct value propositions, whether through Web3Bay’s decentralized e-commerce model, Stellar’s rapid transaction capabilities, Cardano’s research-driven framework, or Tron’s growing role in DeFi. Each of these projects is positioned for significant developments in 2025. Web3Bay’s presale momentum is growing, while Tron continues expanding its DeFi applications. Meanwhile, Cardano and Stellar remain focused on scaling their ecosystems. With these four cryptos in focus, there’s plenty of room for growth as blockchain adoption accelerates.

In an interview with Rob Nelson on Roundtable, Boiron explained that Bitcoin scarcity and growing demand will drive the surge of the token’s price. He said: You’ve got this one asset that has this fixed supply, and all you need to figure out is whether demand is going to increase for this asset or not. It’s literally that simple. Marc Boiron Boiron has high expectations for Bitcoin, claiming the token poses less of a threat to investors in the current market state The CEO argued that Bitcoin is the easiest financial asset to figure out, yet most people don’t understand this concept. He even believes the asset could trade as high as $250,000 in the year, adding that Bitcoin will rise as demand for it grows and supply remains the same. He even pointed to the token’s scarcity as a reason for its potential growth. Moreover, he stated that, given the current market, Bitcoin has less downside risk despite the token’s history of price volatility. Boiron stated that with upcoming regulations, he can see that Bitcoin will pose less of a risk to investors than it typically does. Bitcoin dropped to less than $97,000 on Friday after the Bybit hack Crypto prices dipped on Friday after hackers drained almost $1.5 billion from crypto exchange Bybit. According to security analysts, North Korea’s Lazarus group was responsible for the attack. However, these analysts are overly concerned about the group’s advanced techniques, seeing how they pulled the largest attack in crypto history. Bitcoin fell to less than $97,000, down from close to $100,000 after the attack. Currently, the asset is trading at only $96,581, though it represents a 1.36% rise in the last 24 hours. Ether also slipped by nearly 4%, trading below $2.700. However, the coin is doing so much better now, showing a 5% rise in the last 24 hours to $2,774 . On Friday, Coinglass also reported they were over $500 million in liquidations.

33767162,[object Object],1740272413,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin On-Chain Metric Resets To 1.01 — Here’s Why It Could Spark A Rally,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoins-asopr-resets-here-why-it-could-spark-rally/,"Following a brief ascent above $99,000 on Friday, the Bitcoin market experienced a negative end to the past trading week as prices crashed below $96,000 in a sharp descent. Based on these happenings, the premier cryptocurrency remains in consolidation with little indication of its long-term price movement. Notably, blockchain analytics firm Glassnode has shared a recent network development hinting at a possible price rally. Bitcoin At A Crossroads: Key Metric Set Could Decide Next Move In an X post on Friday, Glassnode reports that Bitcoin’s aSOPR is at 1.01, a critical metric level that places the crypto asset in a delicate market position. Generally, an adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (aSOPR) is an on-chain metric that measures the profitability of Bitcoin transactions by comparing the selling price of coins to their acquisition price. When the aSOPR is above 1, it indicates that the average Bitcoin holder is selling at a profit. Conversely, a value below one indicates that BTC is being sold at a loss. Therefore, Bitcoin’s aSOPR at 1.01 suggests that market participants are barely making profits on their transactions. According to Glassnode , the BTC market is historically a breakeven point where further movement of the aSOPR in either direction could significantly impact price trajectory. In 2021, Bitcoin’s aSOPR reset to around 1.01 preceded a strong bull run that eventually resulted in the then new-all time of $64,800. A similar reset was also seen in late 2023 resulting in a price surge to around $69,000. Going by these past events, if Bitcoin’s aSOPR holds above 1.01, it would suggest buyer absorption indicating a renewed market confidence in anticipation of an incoming price rally. On the other hand, if the aSOPR decline continues a break below 1.0, this development would mean sellers are offloading BTC at a loss which can signal further downward pressure. BTC Price Outlook At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $96,300 following a significant 1.98% loss in the past day. Meanwhile, its daily trading volume has gained by 51.28% indicating an increased market interest. This increased market interest amidst price decline could be indicative of either a panic selling by concerned investors or strong accumulation by market bulls. Based on the BTCUSDT daily chart, breaking and holding above $99,000 could mark an end to the current consolidation phase leading to a sustained price uptrend. However, a price fall below $95,000 could pave the way for all bearish possibilities with certain analysts hinting at a potential return to $76,000.",Bitcoin|Bitcoin aSOPR|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Glassnode,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-23 01:00:13

Litecoin is gaining momentum amid talk of potential ETF approval, which could attract more mainstream traders. At the same time, Shiba Inu coin has seen its burn rate soar by 2,000%, reducing supply and driving speculation about future prices. While these moves grab attention, a bigger shift might be unfolding in Web3 e-commerce. Web3Bay is reshaping the Shopify model by removing middlemen and fees. This blockchain-powered marketplace gives sellers full control over their stores. With a fast-moving presale, those who act early could join a major shift in online selling. Web3Bay Disrupts E-Commerce: No Middlemen, No Extra Charges! Shopify made it simple for anyone to start an online store, but Web3Bay is going further by cutting out platform fees and third parties. Sellers on Web3Bay maintain complete control without depending on banks, payment processors, or centralized platforms that charge high fees. Transactions happen directly on the blockchain, ensuring lower costs, faster payments, and no risk of frozen funds. This is a game changer for small businesses struggling with hidden fees on platforms like Shopify. Web3Bay is already gaining attention. Its presale has raised over $1.5 million, with the 3BAY token priced at $0.004562625 in the current stage. The price increases by 15% at each stage, offering growth potential for those who get in early. At launch, 3BAY is expected to reach $0.1959, making it one of the most promising presales right now. LTC crypto has shown how decentralized finance is reshaping industries, and Web3Bay is bringing the same approach to online shopping. Sellers connect directly with customers, eliminating platform interference, while buyers enjoy lower prices. As Web3 commerce grows, Web3Bay is positioning itself as a leading platform that could challenge traditional e-commerce giants. Litecoin Eyes ETF Approval as Price Momentum Builds Litecoin is gaining attention as talks of spot ETF approval gain steam. Bloomberg analysts estimate a 90% chance that the SEC will approve Litecoin’s ETF this year, which could attract more traditional traders. With Bitcoin paving the way for crypto ETFs, Litecoin’s solid track record and growing institutional adoption could push its price higher. Recent trends also suggest bullish momentum. Litecoin’s price has climbed 24.3% in the past week, outperforming the broader crypto market’s 5% growth. GameStop’s reported interest in crypto assets, including Litecoin, adds to the excitement. If ETF approval happens, Litecoin could see a surge in demand, making it a coin to watch in 2025. Shiba Inu Coin’s Burn Rate Surges 2,000% as Whale Activity Rises Shiba Inu coin is showing strong on-chain activity, with its burn rate jumping over 2,000% in the past 24 hours. More than 14 million SHIB tokens have been taken out of circulation, increasing speculation about future price movements. Reducing supply has always been key to SHIB’s price potential. Recent large withdrawals by whale wallets—such as the 85.5 billion SHIB moved from Coinbase—suggest growing interest. Unlike Litecoin, which is focused on mainstream adoption through ETFs, Shiba Inu aims to build a long-term ecosystem. Lead developer Shytoshi Kusama has shared an ambitious plan to make SHIB a global player by 2030. With rising burns, whale interest, and strategic growth, SHIB could be gearing up for a significant move. Summing Up! Litecoin could experience a major shift if ETF approval boosts demand from traditional traders. Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu coin is gaining traction with its 2,000% burn rate spike and whale transactions tightening supply, which could affect future prices. Both coins are attracting attention for different reasons. However, Web3 e-commerce is emerging as another major force, with Web3Bay leading the way. With its presale surpassing $1.5 million, Web3Bay offers an alternative to Shopify by giving sellers full control and removing platform fees. As traditional platforms continue to charge high fees, Web3Bay’s model could be the breakthrough that small businesses need as e-commerce evolves.

While Bitcoin (BTC) enjoys a well-deserved surge, whispers are circulating about another cryptocurrency poised to benefit even more significantly. FloppyPepe (FPPE) , an AI-powered meme token, is being tipped for the largest gains. Hence, the question is, why is FloppyPepe (FPPE) attracting so much attention in the wake of the BlackRock massive Bitcoin (BTC) buy-in? BlackRock Go Big On Bitcoin (BTC) With $127M Investment On February 16, BlackRock bought $127 million of Bitcoin (BTC). While BlackRock is known for its large investments, its purchases often show their faith in the token’s growth. However, an analyst has said their recent investment in Bitcoin (BTC) will take an unexpected turn. Crypto veterans expect Bitcoin (BTC) to surge but believe an AI-powered meme token will benefit the most from this transaction. Their rationale is that the combination of this token’s AI feature and its Real-world asset (RWA) attribute will make it a lifeline investment . FloppyPepe (FPPE): A High-Growth AI-powered Meme Token in a Bitcoin-Influenced Market The recent Bitcoin (BTC) surge, triggered by BlackRock’s $127 million investment, dominates news headlines, but seasoned investors pay attention to other developments. FloppyPepe (FPPE) emerged quickly into the spotlight as an AI-powered meme token with significant growth opportunities. Market analysts suggest that this AI-driven coin stands out due to its ability to capitalize on Bitcoin’s (BTC) rising power to draw in both meme enthusiasts and investors seeking quick profits. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is distinct from traditional meme coins because it incorporates AI-driven utilities to strengthen its sustainability. Its AI video agent delivers immediate market analysis for investors to make better decisions. Users will have the opportunity to earn revenue from AI-produced images through a forthcoming text-to-image feature on its Telegram channel. This inventive approach allows FloppyPepe (FPPE) to tap into rapidly expanding areas of the cryptocurrency market. Through its strategic tokenomics model, the FloppyPepe (FPPE) AI-powered Meme token offers more than technology. Through a 3% transaction redistribution system, current holders can earn passive income alongside the benefits of stability and scarcity. By implementing a deflationary burn mechanism, the platform increases asset value and creates opportunities for significant profit growth with rising demand. FloppyPepe (FPPE) prioritizes security and credibility within its fundamental objectives. As such, the network completed a smart contract audit by SolidProof to strengthen its transparency against possible exploits. The project spends a fraction of its revenue on wildlife preservation while showing dedication to improving investor portfolios and creating worldwide change. These elements have improved market trust in this AI-powered meme token. At its current price of $0.0000002 , FloppyPepe (FPPE) presents investors with affordability and profitable potential. Top YouTube crypto influencer NASS Crypto joins market veterans and analysts who support FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) future success. Bitcoin (BTC) leads institutional adoption, but major percentage gains might emerge from AI-powered meme tokens like FloppyPepe (FPPE). This AI-based meme coin stands ready to surpass Bitcoin (BTC) instead of merely following its momentum. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Gains Traction After BlackRock’s Buy-in Bitcoin (BTC) remains the leading cryptocurrency in the world, and BlackRock remains at the top of influential whale networks. Hence, the recent BlackRock investment in Bitcoin (BTC) has strengthened market trust. The most eye-catching aspect of this development is how this move affects altcoins like FloppyPepe (FPPE) . Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent rise demonstrates its established market position, while FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) expected profits demonstrate how the crypto market continues to evolve dynamically. Due to its mix of meme coin characteristics and AI functionalities, this AI-powered meme token benefits from growing interest in intelligent, community-focused projects. While it is uncertain if FloppyPepe (FPPE) will outperform Bitcoin’s (BTC) gains, its rapid growth rate shows it is the most prospective token in the 2025 market. Its affordable entry point makes it an attractive asset for a prosperous crypto market.
