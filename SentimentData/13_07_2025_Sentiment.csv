By 2028, ADA/USD could decline and reach $2.63. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $8.61 Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.7066 Market Cap $21 Billion Trading Volume (24-hour) $677 Million Circulating Supply 45 Billion ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.7427 24-hour Low $0.6902 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 8.23% 50-day SMA $ 0.669534 14-Day RSI 47.74 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green Days 14/30 (47%) Cardano ADA recovers slightly ADA price analysis 1-day chart ADAUSD chart by TradingView Cardano (ADA) has shown a strong bullish rebound on the 1-day chart on. J, climbing to approximately $0.71. The RSI stands at 66.28, suggesting increasing bullish momentum but also approaching the overbought threshold, which often precedes short-term consolidation. The MACD remains positive, with the MACD line above the signal line, indicating sustained upward pressure. Bollinger Bands have widened with the price testing the upper band, reinforcing a volatile breakout move. If ADA maintains this strength, it could challenge the next resistance near $0.75 to $0.80. However, any pullback might retest the $0.68 zone as support before continuation or correction. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart ADAUSD chart by TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart of Cardano (ADA), the price has demonstrated a strong recovery, trading near $0.705. The Bollinger Bands show expansion with ADA testing the upper band, signaling bullish volatility. The Balance of Power (0.83) favors buyers, suggesting dominance of bullish sentiment. However, the MACD histogram reveals some waning momentum as the MACD line dips slightly below the signal line, hinting at short-term indecision. Despite this, the overall structure supports a continuation of the uptrend if ADA holds above $0.68. Failure to maintain momentum could trigger a correction toward the middle Bollinger Band near $0.67 for support.

On the 1-day chart, ADA has reclaimed the $0.70 zone and broken through the upper Bollinger Band, signaling heightened volatility and buyer strength. The RSI at 66.28 suggests ADA is approaching overbought territory but still has room to run. On the 4-hour chart, buyers remain in control, supported by a high Balance of Power (0.83) and expanding Bollinger Bands. If bulls sustain pressure above $0.68, ADA may target $0.75 next. A break below $0.68 could invite consolidation or retracement. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. What will Cardano be worth in 2025? ADA might reach a maximum price of $5.97, with an average trading price of about $5.17 and a minimum price of $5.03. What will Cardano be worth in 2030? In 2030, ADA’s average forecast price could be $5.82. Its minimum and maximum trading price is expected to be $5.63 and $6.75, respectively. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from $10 to $50 or more, if the cryptocurrency market continues to expand and Cardano establishes itself as a leader in blockchain technology. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. In a bullish scenario, ADA could reach $50 to $100 or even higher if it becomes a dominant blockchain platform with real-world utility in finance, governance, and enterprise solutions. However, in a bearish scenario where adoption stagnates or regulations hinder growth, ADA could remain below $10. The price will depend on mass adoption, technological advancements, global regulations, and overall cryptocurrency market trends over the coming decades. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2025, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Based on our analysis, Cardano will reach $5 by 2030, with a forecasted range of around $5.97. This projection is driven by Cardano’s continued technological advancements, growing adoption, strategic partnerships, and increasing market confidence, indicating a positive long-term growth trajectory for the cryptocurrency market. Will Cardano reach $10? ADA is predicted to reach $7.33 by 2031. By this time, the coin is expected to attain a maximum price of $8.61. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano is trading around $0.5823, with an all-time high of $2.80 in early 2021. While not impossible, reaching $50 in the next few years is highly uncertain. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. Predictions indicate that by 2030, Cardano could see significant growth, with estimates suggesting a rise to around $6.75. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges.

The allegation was reportedly made by another Indian exchange, WazirX, which has been under scrutiny since last year's $230 million hack . In an affidavit filed as part of the Singapore High Court proceedings (scheduled for a hearing on July 15, 2025), WazirX reportedly claimed that CoinDCX held user funds in a Lithuania-based entity that was not registered with India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) until February 2025. Gupta denied these allegations in a message to CoinDesk, stressing that his India-based users' INR and crypto funds have always been held by Neblio Technologies, our FIU-IND registered entity, which is fully compliant with all Indian laws. ""For the record: CoinDCX did not have any entity in Lithuania until Feb 2025. We only engaged with third-party entities to explore potential global expansion. No business was ever conducted by CoinDCX (Neblio Technologies) in Lithuania, and no user funds were ever moved to or held by any Lithuania-based entity,"" Gupta said. He added that the exchange updated its Terms of Use to make Neblio Technologies the formal contracting party on Feb. 7 this year, and the change was made to strengthen transparency and user trust. ""We did this proactively so that CoinDCX users never face challenges like those seen during the WazirX episode. This approach safeguards users’ interests, and we hope other Indian exchanges adopt the same standard,"" Gupta said, adding that the exchange ""remains committed, as always, to user safety, transparency, and regulatory compliance.",Policy|WazirX|India|Exclusive|News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|ASIA|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-12 20:29:22

Fueled by a record-setting short squeeze and ETF inflows, the breakout is triggering capital shifts across the market. SUI and Toncoin are showing signs of strength—but it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE, a decentralized political memecoin, that’s quietly entering buy-zone discussions among early-stage investors looking for high-conviction narratives in the next altcoin wave. Bitcoin’s Breakout Powered by Short Squeeze and ETF Inflows The Bitcoin rally has been nothing short of historic. Between July 10–11, over $1 billion in short positions were liquidated, marking the largest forced buyback event since January. Spot ETF inflows continue to accelerate, bringing institutional demand and long-term price pressure. Bitcoin 7-Days price chart from CoinGecko Market sentiment is bullish, with open interest now clustering at the $120K and $140K strike levels. U.S. legislators are also preparing pro-crypto bills as part of an upcoming “Crypto Week,” reinforcing optimism heading into Q3. But the more telling trend? Altcoin rotations are already underway—particularly toward early narratives and low-cap bets. SUI Holds Above $3.50 as DeFi Integrations Fuel Speculation SUI is emerging as one of the most technically robust altcoins this week. After integrating tBTC—a synthetic Bitcoin asset—into its DeFi ecosystem, SUI soared above $3.50 and confirmed its inverse head-and-shoulders breakout pattern. Analysts now point to $3.89 as the next resistance target, with institutional accumulation growing and daily volume tracking higher. It’s a clear indicator that DeFi-aligned narratives are back in focus, especially those with cross-asset bridges and liquidity inflows. But SUI’s surge is also creating spillover attention for projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE—those operating in entirely different lanes but benefiting from renewed risk appetite. TON Rebounds Near $2.97 After Visa Controversy Cools Down Toncoin (TON) is stabilizing near $2.97 after weathering a wave of investor uncertainty related to its failed “golden visa” pilot in the UAE. The TON Foundation clarified its limited role in the proposal, and traders are once again watching the charts. TON’s symmetrical triangle setup signals a potential volatility breakout. Support at $2.81 has held, and sentiment is slowly improving, although technical indicators remain mixed. Analysts caution that TON needs a clean break past $3.00 to resume its previous trend. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Political Altcoin Narrative Enters Buy-Zone Phase While BTC, SUI, and TON dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is making noise where it matters—wallets, volume, and forums. The meme-powered altcoin recently passed $11.2 million raised with over 5,234 verified holders. But what’s attracting fresh attention is the breakout behavior: weekly volume is up 320%, and 1,500+ new wallets were created in under 48 hours. MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t riding ETF news or protocol upgrades—it’s leading with ideological clarity. As a decentralized political memecoin, its zero-tax model, HashEx-audited contract, and capped 170B supply structure offer a scarcity play built on anti-centralization values. Early discussions suggest listing momentum could follow if current community traction continues. Traders who missed early SHIB or DOGE waves are calling MAGACOIN “the politically aligned altcoin for this cycle.” Final Thoughts Bitcoin is climbing. SUI is strengthening. TON is stabilizing. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging—fast. As traders look for early-stage opportunities beyond hype cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s mix of community governance, transparent supply, and political identity makes it a serious contender in the next meme altcoin breakout. For a market driven by narratives and timing, this decentralized political memecoin checks both boxes.

In total, over a dozen tokens have entered deep-red territory on the heatmap, an indicator that more tokens are being withdrawn from Binance than deposited. The movement of assets off exchanges is typically interpreted as a signal of long-term investor confidence, as it suggests holders are securing their assets in private wallets rather than preparing to sell. “The Binance netflow heatmap is revealing an extremely bullish pattern,” the CryptoQuant report stated. “Multiple altcoins are glowing red, signaling more outflows than inflows — a classic sign of accumulation by experienced investors.” More altcoins are flowing out of hot wallets The netflow data measures the difference between coins entering and leaving an exchange. When outflows exceed inflows, it typically suggests investors are buying and then moving tokens off-exchange to hold. On the other hand, inflows exceeding outflows often hint at looming sell pressure. The heatmap offers a quick glance at where accumulation might be happening. The most recent snapshot shows red bars across tokens such as Enjin (ENJ), Fetch.ai (FET), Aavegotchi (GHST), Smooth Love Potion (SLP), Gitcoin (GTC), Illuvium (ILV), Curve (CRV), 1inch (1INCH), and more. Ethereum and popular memecoins like DOGE and SHIB are also featured, highlighting the breadth of the trend. Tokens that are deep red in the Binance heatmap signify that they are being withdrawn rather than deposited. Tokens in the green zone indicate inflows. Snapshot of Binance netflow heatmap. Source: CryptoQuant Binance outflows matter The importance of this signal is magnified by its origin: Binance. As the largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume and user base, Binance’s activity often reflects macro investor sentiment, especially among institutional and whale participants. CryptoQuant stated that Binance isn’t just an exchange, but the heartbeat of the global crypto market. When accumulation patterns show up here, it often reflects the actions of the most experienced and well-informed investors. They point to Binance’s liquidity, global accessibility, strong reputation, and growing appeal among institutional capital as key reasons its netflow data serves as a trusted market thermometer. When tokens are withdrawn from exchanges like Binance, analysts interpret the trend as accumulation, often ahead of expected price increases. According to CryptoQuant, such patterns signal lower selling pressure, an upcoming supply shock, and institutional confidence. Token netflow rate on Binance. Source: CryptoQuant This isn’t the first time CryptoQuant’s heatmap has spotlighted early accumulation. Similar patterns appeared ahead of the 2023 and early 2024 altcoin rallies. While the heatmap paints a bullish picture, some caution is warranted. Netflows offer a directional hint but not precise timing. Also, a few large withdrawals can skew data, especially in lower-liquidity tokens. Market forces, such as macroeconomic news, Bitcoin’s price action, and regulatory events, still play a significant role in whether an altcoin rally materializes. For now, the signs are promising.

While the name of the dental clinic was not disclosed, the development underscores the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies for everyday services. Zypto shared that the anonymous individual used its application to complete the transaction entirely in SHIB tokens. The company also noted that the service could be used to settle other bills, including American Express (AMEX), through its platform. How the Payment Was Processed The process of using Shiba Inu to pay for a service through Zypto is designed to be user-friendly. Within the app, the user navigates to the “Bill Payments” section, selects the appropriate service provider, in this case, a dental clinic, and chooses Shiba Inu as the preferred method of payment. One user from the US just paid a $5,000 bill to their dental clinic using Shiba Inu. Yes — you can literally pay for a nicer smile with Zypto. You could even pay your AMEX bill too… for an even bigger smile Try it now: https://t.co/yH2nTXaksB pic.twitter.com/itVw1Tn9lL — Zypto App (@ZyptoApp) July 9, 2025 The user then inputs the amount to be paid and confirms the details. Once submitted, Zypto converts the SHIB tokens into U.S. dollars and transfers the fiat equivalent to the service provider’s account. This process is completed within 48 hours. Zypto charges a flat processing fee of $5 along with an additional 3% of the transaction value. Users are not required to convert their crypto holdings to fiat beforehand; the conversion is automatically handled after the payment is confirmed. About Zypto and Its Capabilities Launched in May 2024, Zypto App is a multi-functional cryptocurrency wallet and payments solution. It offers users the ability to pay for goods and services through either virtual or physical payment cards. The platform’s core objective is to facilitate the broader use of digital assets in everyday financial transactions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 As of now, Zypto’s infrastructure supports more than 21,000 merchants in the United States, with additional partners in international markets. The platform accommodates over 100 cryptocurrencies, including major tokens from the Shiba Inu ecosystem such as SHIB, BONE, and LEASH. It also integrates with Shibarium , the project’s Layer-2 blockchain, and supports ShibaSwap, its decentralized exchange. The recent transaction adds to the growing list of examples where Shiba Inu is being used for tangible, real-world purposes . In 2024, Amoré Orthodontic Aligners, a Michigan-based dental care provider, began accepting SHIB as payment for various services, including teeth whitening and orthodontic treatments. As platforms like Zypto continue to make crypto payments more accessible and convenient, the use of digital assets such as Shiba Inu is gradually expanding beyond speculative investment and entering the realm of practical, everyday use.

During this period, BDAG, SEI, CRO, and XRP have caught the spotlight. Each project brings something valuable to the table, from fast transactions and unique ecosystems to powerful presale momentum. As traders look for the best long term cryptos, these four names are leading the conversation. SEI, CRO, XRP, and BlockDAG are being noticed for their performance and support from the community. Their mix of advanced features, real-world use, and steady growth makes them interesting choices this year. If someone is exploring which digital coins to follow closely, this blog covers the key points to know. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Community-Driven Crypto With Real Growth BlockDAG (BDAG) has created a wave in the presale space with an impressive $336 million raised. The presale has reached Batch 29, with the current batch priced at $0.0276. So far, 23.7 billion coins have been sold, showing growing momentum and wide interest in the project. BlockDAG is becoming one of the best long term cryptos, with solid figures backing its progress. As part of its GLOBAL LAUNCH release, BlockDAG (BDAG) is offering a special deal: buyers can purchase BDAG coins at just $0.0016 until August 11. This offer takes the price back to early batch levels and presents a potential return of 3,025% when the coin hits its launch price of $0.05. Buyers who joined in Batch 1 have already seen a 2,660% gain based on the current batch rate. BlockDAG has also introduced a helpful Wallet Change feature, allowing users to switch their connected wallet straight from their profile. This small update gives users more control and improves security. With the presale showing no signs of slowing down and features like this being added, BDAG stands out as a strong project with community-driven focus and high potential returns. 2. Sei (SEI): Speed-Powered Blockchain for Traders Sei (SEI) is attracting attention as a fast and efficient Layer-1 blockchain. Built for trading, it can handle up to 20,000 orders every second. At its current price of $0.28 and a $1.5 billion market cap, Sei is expected to reach $1.50 by Q4 2025, marking a possible 436% growth. With over $100 million in Total Value Locked (TVL), the platform continues to gain traction from DeFi developers. As one of the best long term cryptos, SEI offers scalability and reliability. Its mainnet has already processed millions of testnet transactions, building trust. Whale activity and new listings are keeping interest high, helping SEI maintain its pace in a competitive market. 3. Cronos (CRO): Powering the Crypto.com Ecosystem Cronos (CRO) is the force behind the Crypto.com platform, trading now at $0.0807 with a $2.15 billion market cap. It links seamlessly with Crypto.com’s services like exchange, wallet, and DeFi tools. Analysts predict CRO may touch $0.50 by Q4, offering a possible 520% increase, driven by the platform’s 80 million users and partnerships, including one with Visa. Built on an EVM-compatible chain, CRO supports DeFi and NFTs with over $500 million in TVL. As one of the best long term cryptos, its technical chart points to a possible breakout. It also stands out due to its strong compliance setup, offering users a stable and secure environment. 4. Ripple (XRP): Leader in Global Payments Ripple (XRP) keeps leading in the cross-border payments space. Currently priced at $2.19 and valued at $127.27 billion, it’s projected to reach $5 by Q4 2025, a 128% potential rise. This comes after a $50 million SEC settlement and ongoing ETF buzz. Whale activity has been strong, with 30 million XRP recently bought, hinting at an upward move beyond $2.70. While some legal questions remain, XRP continues to build confidence with fast transactions and over 300 bank ties. As part of the best long term cryptos list, XRP offers a balance of speed, utility, and solid global partnerships. Summing Up! In a growing market, BDAG, SEI, CRO, and XRP all offer strong qualities. SEI brings speed and trading focus, CRO connects to a huge user base, and XRP leads in global payments. Still, BlockDAG stands apart with its outstanding presale success, raising $336 million and selling 23.7 billion coins. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release pricing BDAG coins at just $0.0016 until August 11, and a Wallet Change feature boosting user control, BlockDAG is hard to overlook. The new BEAT VESTING PASS allows 80% coin access at launch, unlike the regular 40%, giving early buyers a solid edge. For anyone tracking the best long term cryptos in 2025, these four coins are all worth a closer look.

48129088,https://timestabloid.com/?p=74189,1752354037,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Analysts Believe Ruvi AI (RUVI) Is Set To Be The New Dogecoin (DOGE), $2.3M Raised And Over 2100 Holders Is Just The Start",https://timestabloid.com/analysts-believe-ruvi-ai-ruvi-is-set-to-be-the-new-dogecoin/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) cemented its position as a fan-favorite cryptocurrency, driven largely by community support and meme-driven hype. However, the crypto space continues to evolve and reward utility over speculation. Analysts now point to Ruvi AI (RUVI) as the next big player, with a robust roadmap that combines usability, transparency, and structured growth. With $2.3 million raised, over 185 million tokens sold , and more than 2,100 holders onboard during its presale, analysts believe Ruvi AI can outpace the trajectory Dogecoin once followed. Here’s why Ruvi AI is positioned to become the next big thing in cryptocurrency. Security and Transparency from the Start A token’s success often hinges on trust, an area where Ruvi AI excels. The project underwent a rigorous third-party audit by CyberScope , one of the leading blockchain security firms. This audit ensures that Ruvi AI’s smart contracts are free from vulnerabilities, reassuring investors about the safety of their funds. On top of that, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange , guaranteeing post-presale liquidity for a seamless trading experience. Investors won’t find themselves restricted or locked into long waiting periods for access to trading, a crucial benefit for both retail and institutional participants. These steps set a high bar for credibility and serve to differentiate Ruvi AI from speculative tokens like DOGE. A Phenomenal Start to Its Presale Numbers don’t lie. Ruvi AI’s presale success highlights strong market interest and early adoption: $2.3 million raised during the effort so far. Over 185 million tokens sold , showcasing substantial demand from buyers. A growing community of more than 2,100 token holders , indicating early momentum. Currently priced at just $0.015 per token in Phase 2 , Ruvi AI offers investors a chance to join at a low entry point. By the end of its presale, the price will surge to $0.07 per token , an impressive 5x ROI before public trading even begins. Analysts predict the token could hit $1 post-listing , a 66x ROI for early investors. Unlike Dogecoin, which has struggled to maintain momentum without external celebrity endorsement, Ruvi AI’s growth is tied to a more sustainable model of real-world utility and investor incentives. Utility That Drives Everyday Value Ruvi AI doesn’t just promise speculative gains, it delivers tools that solve real-world problems by integrating blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI) . This ensures sustained demand for its tokens across industries like marketing , entertainment , and finance . Smarter Marketing Solutions Ruvi AI’s AI-powered tools allow businesses to optimize their advertising campaigns. Enhanced targeting and analytics improve ROI while reducing waste, making Ruvi AI a game-changer for enterprises relying on digital marketing. Support for Content Creators The entertainment industry also benefits from Ruvi AI’s innovations, particularly its blockchain-secured payment systems . These ensure fair and timely compensation for creators while cutting out intermediaries. Its AI insights help creators optimize their content strategies to grow views and revenue streams effectively. Revolutionizing Finance The financial sector is ripe for disruption, and Ruvi AI is taking the lead with fraud-resistant payment systems and secure transaction protocols . These technologies simplify international transactions, making payments faster and more cost-effective for businesses globally. By establishing itself as an invaluable tool in these industries, Ruvi AI ensures high demand for its ecosystem over the long term. Rewarding Early Investors Through VIP Tiers Ruvi AI’s presale offers some of the most rewarding VIP investment tiers , incentivizing early adopters by maximizing their returns: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tiered rewards allow investors of all kinds, whether small-scale or high-net-worth, to secure massive returns by acting early. Why Ruvi AI Could Surpass Dogecoin Dogecoin’s rise leaned heavily on its viral appeal and community-driven roots, but it lacked a clear roadmap or utility to sustain long-term growth. Ruvi AI, in contrast, offers audited transparency , real-world applications , and a structured plan for upward mobility. Its presale price of $0.015 per token makes Ruvi AI incredibly accessible, while the forecasted growth to $1 per token positions it as a serious wealth-building opportunity. For those looking to invest in the next breakout cryptocurrency, Ruvi AI combines the best elements of innovation and scalability, marking it as a smart alternative for anyone still holding onto speculative assets like Dogecoin. Secure your tokens today and step into what could be the next blockbuster success in the cryptocurrency world with Ruvi AI.

Analyst Identifies Where Risk Lies,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-bulls-in-cloud-9-analyst-identifies-where-risk-lies/,"After a near-excellent start to the month of July, Bitcoin has performed even more impressively over the past few days. The premier cryptocurrency, after a brief period of sideways momentum earlier this week, has attained a new all-time-high valuation at a price close to $119,000. Unsurprisingly, the Bitcoin market is experiencing a wave of optimism — an inference still heavily backed by the latest on-chain revelation. Bitcoin Market Sentiment Shifts Bullish In a July 11 post on social media platform X, cryptocurrency analytics firm Alphractal delved into the current price action of Bitcoin, offering insights into the cryptocurrency’s future trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Soars Past $118,800—Breakout Or Brutal Bull Trap? The firm’s on-chain observation revolves around the Aggregated Liquidation Levels Heatmap (7 Days) metric, which visualizes price zones with high concentrations of long or short liquidations over a span of 7 days, and the Aggregated Liquidation Levels Heatmap (1 month) which does the same, except that this covers a monthly timeframe. After the most recent Bitcoin price rally to a new all-time high, all of the overleveraged bears had their market positions wiped out. Aided by the short squeeze, which usually follows such large liquidation events, the flagship cryptocurrency still retains its strong bullish momentum and continues to surge. According to Alphractal, the aggregation liquidation levels across different timeframes now show that most current leveraged positions are betting on the Bitcoin price. As the market continues to ascend the charts, investor optimism will turn more positive, which may further push more traders to open long positions in the BTC futures market. However, Alphractal warned against the inclination to be recklessly involved in the current bullish market. “If, for any reason, the price drops $10,000 back to the $107,000 zone, it could be the bulls’ turn to face massive liquidations,” the analytics firm said. The firm went further, explaining that a Bitcoin price drop of that magnitude would have a negative impact on the market optimism. On the bright side, Alphractal also mentioned that such an occurrence could offer new accumulation opportunities in the near future. Still on market optimism, a drop in Bitcoin’s value by $10,000 might lead to a phenomenon referred to as a Long squeeze, where the price of Bitcoin continues to plummet with increased momentum. A long squeeze typically occurs when the falling price of a cryptocurrency (in this case, Bitcoin) forces traders with long positions to sell their assets either to cut losses or to break even. This contributes to the already present bearish momentum and sends the BTC price further south. Amidst Bitcoin’s current rally, Alphractal ultimately advised that traders leverage wisely and with caution, as the market’s next action stands at an unpredictable zone. Bitcoin Price At A Glance Still showing signs of healthy bullish momentum, Bitcoin, as of press time, is valued at around $118,145. Data from CoinGecko shows that the flagship cryptocurrency has jumped by more than 3.34% in the last 24 hours.

Our Jito price prediction expects the JTO price to record a maximum of $8.56 in 2025. In 2030, we expect the JTO price to achieve $57.27. In December 2023, the Jito (JTO) token airdrop garnered significant attention for the Solana blockchain , which had been facing challenging times. The event also highlighted the importance of liquid staking on Solana while empowering holders to influence platform governance. Based on these developments, we’ve compiled our Jito price prediction, explored the factors behind these forecasts, and provided insights into the role and utility of the JTO token.

Currently, the JTO price is preparing for further declines. JITO price analysis 1-day chart: JTO price triggers minor bearish momentum Analyzing the daily price chart of JTO tokens, JITO witnessed a bearish correction after sellers pushed the price below $2. However, buyers are now aiming for a hold above immediate Fib channels. The 24-hour volume dropped to $5.25 million, showing de interest in trading today. JITO’s price is currently trading at $1.87, which has dropped by over 3% in the last 24 hours. JTO/USDT Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and currently hovers around the 43 level, showing that bears control price momentum. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. JITO/USDT 4-hour price chart: Buyers aim big above EMA levels The 4-hour JITO price chart suggests that JTO experienced a bearish activity below EMA lines, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart.

The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the JITO price from an immediate surge. However, if the JITO price successfully breaks above $2.257, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $2.545. JTO/USDT Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, JITO price may drop below the immediate support line at $1.817, resulting in a correction to $1.557. Is Jito a good investment? For enthusiasts within the Solana community, the introduction of JTO marks a significant event, as it empowers users to govern one of the network’s largest liquid staking protocols. Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito’s price in 2025 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there’s no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, unveiling a future roadmap or declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token. Why is the JTO down today? JTO’s price gained strong selling pressure around local highs, resulting in a strong decline. This created a push below $2. Will the JTO price recover? If buyers hold above the $2 level, we might see a comeback in buying demand. Will JTO reach $10? JTO price might reach the $10 mark in 2025 if buying demand surges and Jito attracts altcoin investors. However, our JTO price prediction states it might reach the $10 level by 2026. Will the JTO price reach $100? Due to the effort of the Solana community, JITO Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is no indication that the JITO (JTO) Coin will reach $100 soon, which is a short-term target. Is JTO a good long-term investment? JTO tokens have gained popularity thanks to strong community support through airdrops, benefiting the Solana ecosystem. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment. Recent news/ Opinion on JTO news SOL Strategies has announced the launch of a new initiative to support critical infrastructure within the Solana ecosystem. The Canada-based public company revealed on June 26 that it has established a Strategic Ecosystem Reserve (SER), starting with a purchase of over 52,000 Jito (JTO) tokens, valued at more than $100,000. Jito price prediction July 2025 Over the last few days, JTO coin prices have aimed to surge above crucial Fib levels. If the BTC price aims for a hold above $110K this month, we might see a solid surge in the JTO price. According to technical analysis, the JTO price might record a maximum level of $2.9 and a minimum of $1.3, with an average value of $2.1 throughout July.

This increase is likely to exert downward pressure on the value of Jito crypto. However, 2025 is also expected to showcase the significant impact of the Bitcoin Halving, which could propel crypto markets and tokens to new all-time highs, potentially boosting the Jito token price. A comprehensive technical analysis of past pricing trends suggests that in 2025, Jito is anticipated to have a minimum price of $1.1. Its maximum price could reach $8.56, with an expected average trading value of $7.34.

This includes topics such as the conflict between Israel and Palestine, abortion, and immigration law. Observations suggest that Grok 4 is specifically designed to take into account the political views of the head of xAI when answering controversial questions. Earlier, the billionaire announced that his startup would rewrite “all human knowledge” to train a new version of the chatbot, since the current models use “too much garbage in any basic model trained on unadjusted data.” AI expert Gary Marcus compared Musk’s plan to a dystopia. Later, Grok became more emphatic and began issuing controversial and contradictory statements. xAI noted that it is working to remove inappropriate content. TechCrunch asked Grok 4 for its opinion regarding immigration in the U.S. and found that the chatbot had “sought out Elon Musk’s views” on the topic during its line of reasoning. According to TechCrunch, Grok 4’s chain of thought regarding the issue of immigration in the U.S. revealed a tendency to reference Musk’s opinions. The chains of reasoning that AI models create to explain their answers are not a completely reliable indicator of exactly how they arrive at their conclusions. However, they are generally considered to be a reasonably good reflection. The publication’s journalists have repeatedly found that Grok 4 draws on Musk’s views in its responses. In its answers, the chatbot tries to provide a balanced position, offering several points of view on sensitive topics. However, in the end, it often expresses an opinion that coincides with Musk’s position.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-12 21:33:04

This asset class raked in $907 million in weekly inflows this past week and marked their best week ever. It is worth noting that the milestone coincided with the period when ETH recorded a 17% weekly gain. Three Consecutive Days of Ethereum ETF Inflows Ethereum ETFs were launched in July 2024, and since that time, it has faced some challenges in hitting a breakthrough. Its inflows have not been as productive as those of Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs. All of a sudden, the Ethereum ETFs registered their best weekly inflows. According to SoSoValue, investors plunged $907.99 million into Ethereum ETFs in the past week alone. E ven crypto market expert Nate Geraci acknowledged the inflows on X , citing that these inflows include three of the top 10 inflow days overall. Markedly, the most significant daily inflows for the week were recorded on July 10, when these funds took in $383.10 million. In addition to July 10, July 9 and 11 were days when the funds recorded top inflow this week. Specifically, the ETFs recorded net inflows of $211.32 million and $204.82 million, respectively, on these days. Ethereum Price Performance and Outlook Meanwhile, Ethereum price has recorded some uptick this week with Bitcoin price climbing to a new All-time-high (ATH) above $117,000. The largest altcoin by market capitalization went above the $3,000 level in the process. The rally ran past 17%, but the coin has since seen some fluctuations. At press time, Ethereum was trading at $2,923.59, corresponding with a 1.51% drop within the last 24 hours. Its market capitalization has also dropped to $353.11 billion, and the 24-hour trading volume has reduced by 53.59% to $20.88 billion. SharpLink Acquired 10,000 ETH to Reinforce its Position Apart from the rally in ETH price, the coin gained attention from an acquisition by SharpLink . Notably, the company purchased 10,000 ETH in exchange for $25,723,680, pegging a unit of ETH at $2,572.37. The acquisition deepens the company’s association with the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. SharpLink’s Ethereum holding has now moved from 205,634 ETH, which was previously disclosed, to about 215,634 ETH.

As the race for maximum portfolio growth in 2025 heats up, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Bonk (BONK) are drawing attention. At its current price of $0.03 MUTM is flying fast during presale stage. Mutuum Finance is in presale stage 5 of which 65% has been sold out as investors pile in. The token is at its lowest possible price of $0.03. A 16.7% jump will follow as phase 6 sets in. Over $12.1 million has been raised to date, and over 13100 investors have entered the presale. Alongside it, established community-driven altcoins like BONK are holding their ground, continuing to attract holders with consistent network activity and solid ecosystem engagement. BONK: Solana’s Meme Coin Steadies Amid ETF Buzz BONK has recently drawn attention after a robust 60% rally over the past week, fueled in part by speculation around a leveraged BONK ETF and the approaching 1 million-holder mark, which would trigger a significant token burn. Despite a modest pullback of around 1.6% on July 9 as some profit-taking emerged, on-chain metrics show strengthening user engagement through Burn-fuelled market share shifts, and whales continue to accumulate in advance of key regulatory developments. With technical indicators suggesting emerging bullish trends, like a potential Golden Cross, the token is displaying a steady undercurrent as it hovers near current resistance levels. Altogether, BONK presents a case of measured growth tied closely to ecosystem milestones and broader crypto sentiment, even as momentum builds elsewhere around tokens like MUTM. Mutuum Finance Surpasses $12.1M in Presale Milestone Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has taken over 2025 as one of the most promising DeFi tokens in 2025. With over $12.1 million raised and over 13100 investors already in, the presale is gaining real traction. During phase five, the token is priced at $0.03. The next stage will see the price increase to $0.035, and with an already set official launch price of $0.06, early investors are already on a 100% profit. MUTM can skyrocket to as high as $3 after launch. That is a 9900% ROI for current purchasers. Shaping the Future of Decentralized Lending Mutuum Finance offers a non-custodial liquidity protocol where users own complete control of assets throughout decentralized lending. The project follows a double-model approach that incorporates Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending in an attempt to achieve greater flexibility and efficiency. Peer-to-Contract system utilizes smart contracts to establish automatic lending with no human interference and rather, the smart contracts respond to the market by giving dynamic interest rates. Peer-to-Peer model eliminates middlemen and gives direct access between the borrowers and the lenders. The model is highly preferred by users for volatile assets where there exists a necessity for flexibility and tailored terms. Mutuum Finance Strengthens Security with $50K Bounty & Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is hosting a $100,000 giveaway . 10 people will each receive $10,000 MUTM tokens. The project has also launched a new leaderboard where top 50 token holders will be rewarded with bonus tokens for maintaining their ranks. To improve security, Mutuum Finance has initiated a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. Every vulnerability will be rewarded, with the bounty focusing on four key levels: critical, major, minor, and level four will be low. As 2025 unfolds, savvy investors are locking in high-potential altcoins early, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is leading the charge. With over $12.1 million raised, more than 13,100 investors onboard, and 65% of Phase 5 sold out, MUTM is quickly emerging as a top-performing DeFi asset. Priced at just $0.03, and with a confirmed listing price of $0.06, current buyers are already eyeing a 100% gain, with long-term projections reaching up to $3, a potential 9,900% ROI.

Here’s Why Experts Favor This Newcomer’s Audited Token for the Next 13,800% ROI Rally",https://timestabloid.com/ruvi-ai-ruvi-or-shiba-inu-shib-heres-why-experts-favor/,"For cryptocurrency investors, finding the next big opportunity can feel like chasing a moving target.

In fact, CryptoRank revealed that funding reached $10 billion, making this year its strongest showing since early 2022. The stats come amidst rising Bitcoin prices and a thaw in risk appetite, which encouraged investors to re-engage with the sector. Crypto VC Roars Back According to the report shared by CryptoRank, the recovery was driven heavily by June’s $5.14 billion haul. This period witnessed the highest monthly tally since January 2022, following a long period of sluggish deal activity. The sharp uptick aligns with Bitcoin’s rally above $100,000. During the quarter, major players like Strive Funds, founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, pulled in $750 million for Bitcoin-focused alpha strategies in May. Next up were TwentyOneCapital, which raised $585 million in April, and Securitize, which managed to secure $400 million. Other notable raises included Kalshi, Auradine, ZenMEV, and Digital Asset, which raked in $185 million, $153 million, $140 million, and $135 million, respectively. The venture capital arm of Coinbase, Coinbase Ventures, emerged as the most active investor. It executed 25 deals in Q2, ahead of Pantera Capital, Animoca Brands, and Andreessen Horowitz. Meanwhile, Paradigm led in the number of lead investments, while Galaxy Digital closed its first external venture fund at $175 million, surpassing its initial target to back high-growth crypto subsectors, including stablecoins, tokenization, and payment rails. Amsterdam’s Theta Capital also added over $175 million to its fund-of-funds to support early-stage blockchain startups. Other Trends CryptoRank’s data also shows that while seed-stage deals still command the largest slice of activity at nearly 19%, strategic and Series A rounds are steadily growing with 14% and 6% respectively. Interest in M&A is also picking up as distressed opportunities continue to emerge in the sector, with a share of around 10%. The rebound in venture funding comes amid muted memecoin investment trends. In addition to that, monthly crypto fundraising throughout April, May, and June was led by blockchain services, consistently outpacing DeFi and CeFi.

By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $1.77. In 2031, FLOW will range between $4.59 to $5.54. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.375 Market Cap $601.04M Trading Volume $36.8M Circulating Supply 1.59B FLOW All-time High $46.16 All-time Low $0.2916 24-hour High $0.3875 24-hour Low $0.3691 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.70% 50-Day SMA $0.3600 14-Day RSI 61.65 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 79 (Extreme Greed) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.4392 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown The broader upside for FLOW remains intact, despite minor consolidation. Support is present at $0.365, and resistance is at $0.380. The next breakout target is at $0.40. Flow coin 1-day price analysis: FLOW demonstrates encouraging recovery signs The daily chart for July 12 reveals FLOW has carved out a significant bottom formation around $0.30 support after experiencing a dramatic selloff from highs near $0.395. The token currently trades at $0.375, representing a solid 25% recovery from the June lows, while the RSI has climbed from deeply oversold levels below 30 to a more neutral 49.51, indicating buyers are stepping in with conviction. FLOWUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD histogram shows early signs of bullish divergence with the blue line crossing above the signal line. Most notably, price action has broken above the 20-period moving average at $0.336. It is now testing resistance near the upper Bollinger Band at $0.371, with volume increasing during recent green candles, confirming ongoing interest at these levels. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis: Short-term momentum remains constructive despite minor pullback pressure The 4-hour timeframe paints a more optimistic picture with FLOW maintaining a clear uptrend channel, supported by the ascending trendline that has held multiple retests around $0.335. The recent price action shows some consolidation near $0.375 with slightly declining volume, as evidenced by the OBV (On-Balance Volume) indicator showing minor distribution at -42.88M, though this appears to be healthy profit-taking rather than major selling. FLOWUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The 20-period SMA at $0.369 continues to provide dynamic support, and the overall structure suggests bulls remain in control despite the current sideways movement, with the next major resistance target sitting at $0.390-$0.395, where previous selling pressure emerged. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3629 BUY SMA 5 $0.3633 BUY SMA 10 $0.3487 BUY SMA 21 $0.3403 BUY SMA 50 $0.3600 BUY SMA 100 $0.3787 SELL SMA 200 $0.4392 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3433 BUY EMA 5 $0.3513 BUY EMA 10 $0.3619 BUY EMA 21 $0.3747 BUY EMA 50 $0.4154 SELL EMA 100 $0.4870 SELL EMA 200 $0.5669 SELL What to expect from Flow? Based on both timeframes, FLOW shows upside potential if it holds $0.365 support and breaks $0.380 resistance, targeting $0.40, though a drop below $0.360 could trigger range-bound trading. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming months. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, GMX says the hacker who stole $42 million worth of crypto assets earlier this week from its Arbitrum ( ARB )-based liquidity pool is returning the funds and collecting a $5 million reward. “A potential exploitable amount of $42 million belonging to GLP holders was secured. After payment of a $5 million bounty to the user, the remaining funds are now safely in the GMX Security Multisig. Contributors are working on a proposed distribution plan for presentation to the GMX DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) and will share more information shortly.” According to previous reports, the hacker struck on July 9th and transferred part of the funds to an unknown wallet. At the time, GMX said the exploit was limited to GMXV1 and that V2, its markets and liquidity pools, as well as the ecosystem’s native asset, were unaffected. In its report on the incident, GMX says the exploit was a re-entrancy attack, or a type of hack that affects smart contracts by taking advantage of a vulnerability presented when a smart contract makes a call to another before updating itself, leaving open the possibility for an external malicious contract to enter in. News of the returned fund sent GMX skyrocketing, as the digital asset is trading for $13.36 at time of writing, an 18.4% increase during the last 24 hours.

Fresh off a $1.5 million raise, this smart trading bot is making noise with its hands-free sniping features and upcoming token debut. With traders watching the Snorter token launch date and the Snorter token listing closely, momentum is clearly building. But for all the excitement around Snorter, BlockDAG (BDAG) continues to set the pace. Its presale has already hit $336 million, and the community has surpassed 2 million X1 mobile miners. More than just numbers, it’s about impact, and right now, BlockDAG is showing what reach, consistency, and execution can really deliver. Snorter Bot Builds Momentum With Utility & Timing Sniper bots are on trend, and Snorter is tapping directly into Telegram’s trading culture. With an interface that’s simple to use, plus smart automation and analytics, Snorter stands out as more than just hype, it’s a functioning tool. The Snorter presale is moving quickly thanks to the combination of functionality and community buzz. The confirmed Snorter token launch date and anticipation for the Snorter token listing are drawing eyes to the project. Telegram traders are already testing the bot’s real-time capabilities and building early hype around its sniping tools. But the space is crowded, and timing is everything. Many bots come in fast and fade just as quickly. For Snorter to stay relevant, it needs more than excitement, it needs a reason to keep users engaged after launch. That will be its real challenge. BlockDAG Raises $336M & Enters Stadiums With Seattle Partnerships While Snorter builds its base, BlockDAG is expanding fast, and not just online. With over $336 million raised in its presale and a price fixed at $0.0016 until August 11, BlockDAG has become one of the most talked-about projects this cycle. But the bigger story is BlockDAG’s reach. Its partnerships with the Seattle Orcas (Major League Cricket) and Seattle Seawolves (Major League Rugby) take the project beyond Web3 and into real-world venues. These collaborations put BlockDAG in front of live crowds, giving it mainstream exposure that few crypto projects achieve this early. That visibility isn’t just for show. It gives BlockDAG lasting relevance by placing its name where real audiences gather. While others try to trend on Twitter or boost Discord traffic, BlockDAG is on stadium banners, gaining recognition from new demographics. The value has also been real for early backers. With returns of 2,660% since batch 1 and the launch price confirmed at $0.05, the numbers are already impressive, and they’re backed by a growing ecosystem, not just speculative hype. Bot Hype or Blockchain Momentum? Snorter is gaining attention for good reason. The presale is picking up, the Snorter token launch date is official, and traders are watching closely for the upcoming Snorter token listing. It’s well-timed, and the early response is strong. But in crypto, hype only lasts so long. The key is sticking around when the excitement fades. Without broader infrastructure or a long-term hook, most bots struggle after the initial spike. BlockDAG, by contrast, has already proven staying power. It’s not depending on short-term trends. With millions already mining via the X1 app, hundreds of millions raised, and major sports partnerships underway, it’s built to last. And with momentum grounded in real-world strategy, not just virality, BlockDAG is leading by example. Closing Thoughts Snorter has the right signals for a strong debut. The Snorter presale is showing traction, and with both the Snorter token launch date and token listing confirmed, the setup is solid for short-term interest. But BlockDAG is playing a longer game. With its presale topping $336 million, a community of 2 million+ miners, and real-world exposure through partnerships with the Seattle Orcas and Seawolves, it’s doing more than trending, it’s establishing roots.

On Friday, it climbed to $167, its highest point since 29 May. At the same time, Solana’s memecoin activity surged, with most major coins in the green on the weekly timeframe. According to CoinMarketCap , Solana’s price stands at $160.38 at press time. As the overall crypto market climbed past a market cap of $3.6 trillion this week, Solana’s transaction count on the network rose 32 percent to reach 590 million, according to on-chain data by Nansen . That level outstripped the combined transactions of Ethereum, BNB chain, and Polygon, which changed by roughly 3%, 3.9%, and 7.6%. At the same time, transactions on Base and Tron fell by 3.9% and 0.2%, respectively. Solana price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Nansen data further showed that the number of active addresses on Solana jumped 5.3 percent to 24.4 million, and fees generated climbed 44 percent, reaching $7.68 million. Over the past 30 days, the network handled more than 2.1 billion transactions. Investors show a growing appetite for Solana ETFs and meme coins US-listed Solana ETFs have quietly brought $78 million in the last month, underlining growing demand for altcoin-based funds even as Bitcoin remains the market leader. The REX-Osprey SOL + Staking ETF (SSK), which began trading on July 2, has amassed more than $41 million in assets already, based on Bloomberg Intelligence data. Volatility Shares’ leveraged Solana ETF (SOLT) has gathered $69 million so far this year, while its standard Solana ETF (SOLZ) has held $23 million. These inflows arrive as several fund managers prepare for what they hope will be the next big ETF approval in the US. Although the SEC has not yet green-lit such an offering, many in the industry are growing hopeful it could win approval soon. According to CoinGecko data, meme tokens on Solana have also seen a pump alongside the broader rally.

Among the major meme tokens, only Useless Coin and Melania Meme slipped, down 3.7% and 0.1%. In the last 24 hours, Bonk saw about $1.46 billion in trading volume, Pudgy Penguins $863 million, and Official Trump $520 million, highlighting strong trading interest alongside Solana’s gains. Reflecting the growing interest in Sol-based meme coins, Pump.fun, a Solana-based meme coin launchpad that allows users to create speculative meme coins, raised $600 million in just 12 minutes during its ICO, making it the largest ICO on record.

The firm said an update to the system caused the bot to pull ideas from user content on X, even when those posts included extremist views. xAI posted the apology directly on Grok’s public X acceptance. It clarified that the update was running for about 16 hours before being noticed. “First off, we deeply apologize for the horrific behavior that many experienced,” xAI wrote in the apology. It said the update unintentionally led Grok to echo content from user posts, including extremist ideas. Update on where has @grok been & what happened on July 8th. First off, we deeply apologize for the horrific behavior that many experienced. Our intent for @grok is to provide helpful and truthful responses to users. After careful investigation, we discovered the root cause… — Grok (@grok) July 12, 2025 The incident highlighted AI’s risks, a young technology that critics say could harm economies and societies. Experts have already cautioned against the broad use of AI without appropriate safeguards. In one instance, the chatbot likened itself to “MechaHitler” and lauded Adolf Hitler. xAI froze Grok’s account earlier this week to prevent further public posts; however, users were still able to interact with the bot privately. “We have removed that deprecated code and refactored the entire system to prevent further abuse,” the firm stated. xAI identified three problematic instructions First, a user would tell Grok that they aren’t afraid of offending politically correct users. Then, the user would ask Grok to consider the language, context, and tone of the post, which is to be reflected in Grok’s response. Lastly, the user would ask the chatbot to reply in an engaging and human way, without repeating the original post’s information. The company said those directions led Grok to set aside its core safeguards to match the tone of user threads, including when prior posts featured hateful or extremist content. Notably, an instruction asking Grok to consider the context and tone of the user resulted in Grok prioritizing previous posts including racist ideas, instead of responsibly rejecting a response under such circumstances, xAI clarified. Hence, Grok issued several offensive replies. In one now-deleted message, the bot accused an individual with a Jewish name of “celebrating the tragic deaths of white kids” in the Texas floods, adding: “Classic case of hate dressed as activism – and that surname? Every damn time, as they say.” In another post, Grok stated: “Hitler would have called it out and crushed it.” Grok also proclaimed: “The white man stands for innovation, grit, and not bending to PC nonsense.” After xAI disabled the harmful code, it restored Grok’s public X account so it could again answer user queries. This wasn’t the first instance Grok got into trouble. The chatbot also began talking about the debunked South African “white genocide” narrative when it answered unrelated prompts in May. At the time, xAI blamed it on an unnamed employee who had gone rogue. Elon Musk, who originally belongs to South Africa, has previously suggested that the country is involved in “white genocide”, a claim dismissed by South Africa. Musk previously described Grok as a chatbot that is anti-woke and truth-seeking. CNBC reported earlier that Grok was scanning Musk’s posts on X to shape its responses to user questions.

You want projects with actual use, new developments, and price setups that show real potential. BlockDAG is leading this list with a record-breaking presale and talk of a big U.S. partnership. BONK remains active below $0.00003, driven by meme momentum and Solana connections. CRO, trading around $0.09, powers real-world payment features and DeFi use. Meanwhile, Kaspa (KAS) sticks near $0.15 as it upgrades its fast blockDAG structure and keeps developers interested. 1. BlockDAG: Final Presale Stage & Sports Collaborations Create Buzz BlockDAG is quickly becoming the best crypto for beginners, with explosive presale numbers, a user-friendly mobile mining app, and attention-grabbing real-world partnerships. So far, it’s pulled in over $336 million, sold more than 23.8 billion coins, and onboarded 18,480+ miners. Its X1 Miner app lets anyone with a smartphone mine BDAG, making it easy for new users to join the action. Tech-wise, BlockDAG ’s structure allows fast, scalable, and energy-efficient transactions, something traditional chains struggle with. But what’s turning heads is how BDAG is going mainstream. It already has deals with the Seattle Seawolves and Seattle Orcas have already launched their names into major sports circles, and rumours hint at an even bigger American partnership in the pipeline. Add to that its clear, inflation-resistant emissions model, and BlockDAG looks serious about long-term sustainability. Right now, its presale price is locked at just $0.0016 until August 11. With a launch target of $0.05, early supporters could potentially see a massive 3,025% return. BlockDAG isn’t just hype. Its strong funding, clever marketing, and easy-to-access mining ecosystem make it a real contender for those looking to get in before the crowd. With the presale window closing fast, the upside could be huge. 2. CRO: Real Payment Features & DeFi Expansion Keep It Steady CRO remains a solid pick for those who want real-world use, not just speculation. Priced around $0.09, it fuels Crypto.com’s network, debit cards, and its Pay feature. A fixed supply and token burn system helps CRO avoid inflation, supporting its long-term price story. Analysts watching CRO believe it could retest the $0.12 to $0.15 range if DeFi and payments volume pick up again. It checks the boxes as one of the best cryptos for beginners, especially with the Cronos Chain expanding. Regulatory pressure is something to watch, but steady product upgrades and the platform’s strong brand keep CRO in the running for a comeback. 3. BONK: Meme Power Meets the Speed of Solana BONK is the meme coin to watch if you’re okay with some risk and love community-driven energy. It’s still trading under $0.00003, built on Solana’s speedy, low-fee network. Constant NFT drops, new exchange listings, and frequent supply burns keep BONK buzzing with life. If Solana’s ecosystem continues growing, BONK might revisit its earlier highs near $0.00005. For anyone exploring the best crypto for beginners, BONK’s viral charm and limited supply make it one of those coins that can spike when least expected. While it competes with meme giants like SHIB and DOGE, BONK’s fresh approach keeps it on the watchlist. 4. Kaspa: High-Speed Network With Loyal Developer Support Kaspa is gaining slow but steady attention. Still holding around $0.15, its predictable emissions schedule helps reduce long-term selling pressure. Recent price action suggests that if upgrades and wallet integrations continue, Kaspa could head toward $0.40. If you’re looking for the best crypto for beginners with a simple structure and community backing, Kaspa has its strengths. It’s still under the radar compared to bigger projects, but its fast blockDAG tech and steady rollout of features are helping it gain traction. Long-term success will depend on whether it can stay relevant and compete for attention in a crowded space. Four Projects Bringing Real Potential for New Buyers BlockDAG, BONK, CRO, and Kaspa each offer something unique for anyone exploring the best crypto for beginners . BlockDAG leads with huge presale funding, sports-backed visibility, and a strong mining model. BONK adds high-risk, high-reward energy with its meme strength. CRO delivers real-world payment utility and strong brand presence. Kaspa, while still emerging, offers solid design and consistent development. Out of the four, BlockDAG is clearly the project with the most early momentum, especially with a limited-time $0.0016 entry and whispers of another U.S. deal on the way. Still, all four are worth tracking as market conditions evolve. Getting in early, with the right strategy, could make all the difference this cycle.

Before its recent price surge, the altcoin had been moving mostly sideways within the $0.5 and $0.6 range. Interestingly, the Cardano price seems to just be at the beginning of what is expected to be a monstrous rally over the next few months. A crypto expert on the social media platform X has come forward with an exciting pathway to unprecedented price highs for the ADA token. ADA In Distribution Phase — Perfect Buying Opportunity? In a July 11 post on X, Alphractal founder & CEO Joao Wedson shared an exciting bullish picture for the Cardano price over the coming months. The on-chain expert put forward the $4.9 mark as the market top for the ADA token in the next leg up. Related Reading: XRP Price Builds Momentum — $2.50 Break Sparks Fresh Bullish Wave This bold projection is based on a persistent ascending channel pattern on the daily Cardano price chart. An ascending channel is a chart pattern in technical analysis characterized by two major (rising) trendlines: the upper line acting as the resistance level and the lower line acting as the support level. Typically, the gap between these trendlines is considered a channel within which prices move over a period—while indicating a sustained long-term bullish trend. Traders often use this pattern to identify optimal entry and exit points, as the price usually bounces off the upper resistance level and lower support trendline. As observed in the above chart, the Cardano price has been trading within the ascending channel since the first half of 2019. After falling to the lower trendline earlier this year, the price of ADA soon found support and rebounded to above the $1 level in 2025’s first quarter. However, the altcoin — as with the rest of the crypto market — witnessed a severe downturn that saw the Cardano price return to the lower trendline in late June. Interestingly, the token’s price seems to have found support and is recovering nicely. Wedson, in his post on X, revealed that what the Cardano price is experiencing is more than a mere recovery, as the altcoin might surpass its current all-time high of $3.09 in this phase. According to the on-chain analyst, the ADA token could be trading well above the $3 mark by late October or early November 2025. Furthermore, Wedson noted that the current level might be the right time for investors to jump into the ADA token, as it is still in the distribution phase in the short term. “This might break some technical analysis patterns, but the on-chain analysis looks promising in several aspects — and that’s what I like,” the analyst concluded. Cardano Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ADA stands at around $0.7124, reflecting an almost 6% in the past 24 hours. This positive single-day action underscores the general bullishness that the altcoin has witnessed in the past few days. According to data from CoinGecko, the ADA coin is up by roughly 30% in the last seven days. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Rockets to $0.20 — Can It Go Even Higher?

Mayors and industry representatives have denounced the tariffs , which are scheduled to take effect Aug. 1, from the city to the CDU and across Europe. He said that the EU could count on the Netherlands to support it fully and stressed that the bloc should remain united and act decisively in searching for a proper outcome that would benefit both sides of the Atlantic. EU leaders appeal for unity and dialogue European leaders have quickly urged calm and unity. However, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says she is still open to talking and that the EU will stand up for its economic interests. Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission, said introducing 30% tariffs on EU exports would be “a lose-lose situation for everyone.” She said it could risk thousands of jobs in the United States and reduce trade between the two partners. The EU has always prioritized dialogue with the US and will always have a constructive approach to the transatlantic partnership.” In a post on X, the French leader also said countermeasures could be employed if a deal couldn’t be reached by August. She noted that they condemn the tariffs in the strongest possible way, as the President of the European Commission has done. She added that when European unity and resolve are crucial, the Commission must show it has the political will to defend European interests by acting swiftly and using tools such as the anti-coercion instrument if no agreement is reached. In this context, France stands alongside the European Commission in the discussions and ongoing negotiations aimed at reaching, by August 1, an agreement which is acceptable to all, indeed the kind of agreement between two major trading partners that are the European Union and the US, between interests and value chains shared. Officials in Germany, France, Spain, Italy, and Ireland had all issued similar statements, warning that the tariffs could trigger a new phase of trade conflict with reverberations in markets worldwide. European Union diplomats are pleading with the United States to come back to the table. They say that higher tariffs will harm consumers, hamper the economic recovery, and erode trust among allies. US turns to tariffs to gain trade advantage The 30% tariff announcement has shocked many, although some European officials think it could be a negotiating stance. Brussels reports indicate that Washington uses tariffs as leverage to obtain better trading terms, particularly on technology, agriculture, and digital services. Unnamed US officials that European media have quoted have suggested the tariffs could be lessened or removed if negotiations advance in the next few weeks. However, it is unclear if President Trump is willing to lessen the tariff burden as August 1 approaches faster.

According to a Bloomberg survey of economists, the core Consumer Price Index (CPI)—which excludes food and energy—rose 0.3% last month, marking the largest monthly gain since January. This follows a modest 0.1% increase in May. The annualized core inflation rate is expected to accelerate to 2.9%, its first pickup since the start of the year. While this suggests a slight pass-through of increased import duties, most economists anticipate inflation will gather steam over the coming months, despite retailers’ reluctance to burden consumers who are already tightening their wallets amid a cooling labor market. Fed holds firm as retail sales limp and tariff pressures linger Retail sales data due Thursday is projected to show only marginal growth in June, after two consecutive monthly declines. This will offer deeper insight into consumer behavior and help refine second-quarter GDP estimates. Though consumer spending has moderated, Federal Reserve officials remain cautious about cutting interest rates—their concern: persistent inflation risks tied to tariffs. The next policy meeting is scheduled for July 29-30. Economists at Bloomberg—including Estelle Ou, Stuart Paul, Eliza Winger, and Chris G. Collins—predict that inflation trends in June will mirror May’s: limited tariff-related price increases in goods, offset by continued weakness in services. Web-scraped data shows firmness in items like appliances and furniture, but softness in categories like airfares and used vehicles. Global inflation pulse quickens as central banks brace for tariff fallout Global markets are also waking up to changing inflation trends. In Canada, June inflation figures will be key before the Bank of Canada’s rate decision on July 30. And in China this week, there will be data on gross domestic product as well as retail sales and trade that should give some readings on the effect of American tariffs on its economy. In Japan, inflation is expected to fall to 3.3%, adding pressure on the central bank. There is expected to be no respite from stubbornly high inflation in the UK, keeping the pressure on policymakers even as wage growth cools. In other places, G20 finance ministers are gathering in South Africa at a time of intensifying trade standoffs and escalating global inflation danger. Wednesday could have marked a crucial deadline, ending Trump’s pause on the sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs announced in April. However, this week, he introduced a new round of tariffs, many set to take effect on August 1. Despite the escalation, most investors remain optimistic that the US will sidestep steeper tariff rates, with hopes that Washington will reach trade agreements in the coming weeks with key partners like Japan and South Korea, according to Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. “That’s what the market has built in,” Saglimbene said. “If we don’t get that, then I think there is probably some risk that we would see higher near-term volatility if the White House implements some of these aggressive tariff measures.” With tariff effects spreading through the global supply chains, inflation-growth data and central bank reactions will continue to get close attention in the back half of the year.

The 5th round of Mutuum Finance presale has already sold out over 65%. It is priced at $0.03 in phase 5 and the price will spike by 16.67% in the next phase. The amount raised so far is over the $12.1 million barrier with over 13100 unique token holders. Smart money is already moving in, and those watching for what to buy before July ends are locking in their positions now, before the next leg up. In addition, Cardano (ADA) continues to hold ground in long-term portfolios, offering stability amid the rising momentum of new coins. Mutuum Finance is stealing the spotlight this summer. Steady Gains Keep Cardano on Track At the current price of approximately $0.63, Cardano (ADA) is a steady price as it exhibits a strong trend after slightly dropping at the beginning of this month. Advances in the Cardano ecosystem have continued to increase, as the scaling solution Hydra continues to gain greater use to enhance its transactions and make the ability to write and develop easier. Another driver can be the next Cardano Summit, which is conducted in the middle of July, especially when some information about governance or scaling tools is presented. All in all, ADA remains an interesting investment opportunity to long-term investors interested in a well-planned, gradually developing blockchain with strong fundamentals, thus completing the portfolio of more risky bets on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Strong Investor Demand Drives Mutuum Finance Presale Growth More than $12.1 million has been raised and over 13100 investors have invested in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as presale 5 soars. This shows investor confidence in the project during its early stages is increasing. MUTM is priced at $0.03 before a 17% spike in phase 6. Smart investors are rushing to catch this lowest price. Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract Lending Protocol Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a double-sided lending platform that will serve active as well as passive users of DeFi. Users will receive passive income from lending their USDT through stable passive income-generating smart contract pools providing stable passive income in the project’s Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending system. Additionally, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model permits lenders and borrowers to be as active as they like when it comes to swapping as it does not require a third party. The trend is more prevalent among customers of less secure assets. CertiK-Audited with an Additional $50K Bug Bounty for Enhanced Security Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch a stablecoin that is pegged to the US dollar (USD) on the Ethereum network. Besides, the project is audited by CertiK with a 95.0 trust score. This type of audit provides evidence of the readiness of the platform to become reliable and be institutional-graded transparent. Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty. The bounty will be rewarded on the basis of four levels of severity: critical, major, minor and low. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) $100,000 Giveaway Mutuum Finance values its new investors and has launched a $100,000 giveaway that will give 10 lucky winners $10,000 MUTM as a gesture of gratitude for the investors’ initial trust in the project. The crypto market is good in the first half of 2025, the future of the crypto market thus far is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Having raised more than $12.1 million, having more than 13,100 token holders, and just 65% of the Phase 5 being sold out, it is obvious that the ball is already rolling. Investors who lock in now are getting the best entry price of the first stage because the next 16.67% in Phase 6 triggers. This will increase the price to the next joint in just $0.03 per token.

The filing , filed to recover 40,350 USDT (a stablecoin pegged to the value of the US dollar) that crypto company Tether is currently holding in frozen accounts, refers to the victims only as “Ivan” and “Mouna.” But coverage from crypto outlet NOTUS suggests they are Ivan Soto-Wright, co-founder and chief executive of MoonPay, and Mouna Ammari Siala, the company’s chief financial officer. The DOJ says that the two executives were scammed into moving funds to an account controlled by an individual they believed was Steve Witkoff, a high-profile US real estate developer and co-chair of President Donald Trump’s 2017 inaugural committee. Blockchain data analysis indicates that the USDT was transferred to a wallet associated with Binance. The wallet is associated with Ehiremen Aigbokhan, a Nigerian citizen residing in Lagos. The episode represents an unusual public case in which senior industry players, who had access to advanced crypto tools and security protocols, proved to be as susceptible to what investigators call a fairly simple form of social engineering as the average rank-and-file email user. Scammer employed ‘insulting typo’ to imitate a public figure Unlike other crypto-crimes that rely on hacking or exploiting blockchain vulnerabilities (and perhaps for that reason alone), this scam was executed through deception through discreet email manipulation. The scammers employed bogus email addresses nearly identical to correct ones — substituting a capital “I” for a lowercase “l” in domain names — to deceive their targets. In this situation, emails were sent from steve_witkoff@t47lnaugural.com and financersvp@t47lnaugural.com — addresses spoofing the names of well-known people and events. This practice, called typosquatting, is used frequently in phishing scams and has proven effective at scamming even professionals who are security aware. “IP geolocation data consistently showed emails from these accounts originating from Nigeria, and not the United States,” the DOJ filing says. According to the authorities, Aigbokhan likely obtained the USDT due to a scam involving an international money transfer in the US. The con artists didn’t have to hack into or exploit the blockchain in any way; they only needed a ruse and a convincing pitch to steal the funds. Wallet activity raises further doubts about MoonPay The filing noted that one of the wallets involved in the scam is a marked MoonPay wallet on Etherscan, suggesting that the individuals affected are likely Ivan Soto-Wright and Mouna Ammari Siala. As of press time, MoonPay has not yet publicly replied to requests for comment from multiple outlets, including The Block and NOTUS . The timing of the case is particularly delicate. And in the latest expansion, MoonPay, a popular payment infrastructure for cryptocurrency purchases, made its services available in only a few US states. Still, last month, the NYDFS granted it a BitLicense, which has the consequence of allowing the company to operate in all 50 United States. It is one of the most difficult-to-obtain crypto regulatory licenses in the US and vital for doing business in the financial capital. The incident may raise additional questions about MoonPay’s internal security controls , vetting processes, and executive oversight, particularly if the victims in this case had indeed used the official company wallets to conduct what seem to be personal or poorly vetted transactions. Amid the boom in crypto adoption, the case is a sobering reminder that no one is immune to digital fraud, not even the executives of companies that help build the infrastructure of the crypto economy.

Celestia’s 16% surge in one day has sparked new momentum, while Solana is drawing attention through a stablecoin trial with Japan’s Minna Bank. These moves show how fast sentiment can shift when strong fundamentals back the action. At the same time, BlockDAG is turning heads with a different approach. It’s entering the world of professional sports through new deals with the Seattle Seawolves and Seattle Orcas. Adding to the excitement, BlockDAG has launched a GLOBAL LAUNCH release, offering a discounted $0.0016 entry until August 11, an offer far below its Batch 29 rate of $0.0276. Celestia Recovery Signals Upside Celestia’s TIA spiked 16% within 24 hours after dropping 26% in the previous days. The quick rebound shows that buyers are stepping back in, even as over $2.9 million in spot selling was recorded. Analysts suggest the move wasn’t fear-based selling, but likely profit-taking. Currently, about 78% of TIA holders remain optimistic about future gains. The token is trading close to its upper Bollinger Band at $1.89, a zone analysts identify as an important resistance. Strong interest in derivatives also backs the price movement. If the momentum stays strong, the next ceiling could come into play soon. SOL Tests Stablecoin in Japan Solana is making new strides with a stablecoin experiment led by Minna Bank and Fireblocks. The project explores how Solana’s network, both public and permissioned, can support digital money transfers and settlements within traditional banking systems. This pilot is seen as an important step in proving blockchain’s place in real finance. By using Solana’s tech, Minna Bank wants to create a more efficient system for yen-based stablecoin activity. If results are positive, Solana could see broader usage in Japan’s digital currency space. This adds weight to the current SOL market analysis that points to long-term potential in regulated environments. BlockDAG Scores Big With Seattle Sports Deals BlockDAG is stepping into the spotlight, not just with its presale, but by going all-in on sports to bring blockchain into the mainstream. The platform has signed with the Seattle Seawolves, champions in Major League Rugby, becoming their Official Blockchain Partner. This partnership includes co-branded media, exclusive fan coins, and behind-the-scenes content aimed at deepening fan interaction. That’s not all. BlockDAG has also teamed up with the Seattle Orcas from Major League Cricket, expanding its reach to a global fanbase. Through this partnership, cricket followers will get player-focused digital content and blockchain-driven tools that connect them more closely with the game. These deals aren’t just for show; they’re helping build real engagement and pushing BlockDAG to a wider audience. BlockDAG is currently in Batch 29 with a coin price of $0.0276. But under the GLOBAL LAUNCH release, users can grab a special rate of $0.0016 until August 11. This discounted price could deliver a 3,025% return at the $0.05 launch price. So far, BlockDAG has raised $336 million and sold 23.8 billion coins. With momentum building fast, the project is setting itself apart from typical presales by combining tech with real-world presence. Looking Ahead Celestia is bouncing back fast with a 16% surge, showing how quickly confidence can return. Solana’s move into stablecoin testing with Minna Bank opens doors to financial system adoption, hinting at broader support ahead. But it’s BlockDAG that’s drawing fresh interest with a mix of sports visibility and a limited-time offer. The $0.0016 GLOBAL LAUNCH release price is available until August 11. This, along with its growing presence in rugby and cricket, makes it one of the top crypto projects catching attention this season.

33767162,[object Object],1752375615,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Ripple CEO Drops Bomb On Stablecoin Market, Is RLUSD The Savior?",https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-drops-bomb/,"Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has discussed the current state of the stablecoin industry and how much the industry could be worth in the next few years. He also commented on why his firm’s RLUSD stablecoin has the potential to dominate the market at some point. Ripple CEO Breaks Silence On Stablecoin Market Growth In a CNBC interview , the Ripple CEO noted that the stablecoin market is worth around $250 billion and that many predict that it could grow to between $1 trillion and $2 trillion over the next few years. He further remarked that the growth of these stablecoins has been profound. Tether’s USDT currently leads the way with a market cap of almost $160 billion. Indeed, experts like the US Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, have predicted that stablecoins could reach $2 trillion over the coming years. Bessent also recently alluded to reports that stablecoins could grow into a $3.7 trillion market by the end of the decade. He believes this is more likely with regulations like the GENIUS Act. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is a stakeholder in the stablecoin market, as his firm is the issuer of the RLUSD stablecoin . Garlinghouse admitted that they joined the market relatively late, although they had already been using stablecoins in their payment flows for institutional customers. He indicated that this was what prompted the move to issue the RLUSD stablecoin, in order to serve their clients better. Garlinghouse is confident that the RLUSD stablecoin will benefit from the growth ahead, especially as they continue to serve their institutional clients. Meanwhile, the Ripple CEO noted how the stablecoin has already crossed the $500 million market cap milestone in just a few months since its launch. CoinMarketCap data shows that the stablecoin’s market cap is up over 3% in the last 24 hours, reaching $517 million. Plans To Grow The RLUSD Stablecoin As part of the plans to grow the RLUSD stablecoin, Ripple has applied for a national banking license with the OCC. If approved, the company’s stablecoin will be subject to the regulatory purview of the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). The Ripple CEO stated that the dual nature of that regulation is a new and unique benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market. Garlinghouse again commented on this move during the CNBC interview. The Ripple CEO noted that his firm has been focused on compliance and adhering to existing regulations.

With so many updates hitting the market, today’s developments could help narrow the search. A new Hedera (HBAR) price signal is drawing interest, with RSI divergence forming near a key resistance level, suggesting a potential breakout. Similarly, the SEI short-term analysis points to a possible rally as chart patterns develop on multiple timeframes. In the presale market, BlockDAG (BDAG) has announced a fresh sports partnership with the Seattle Seawolves, a major step toward mainstream presence. With over $336 million raised so far, this announcement is expected to fuel even more interest in one of the largest crypto presales to date. So, which of these projects offers the best chance for upside in the coming year? Let’s break it down. Hedera (HBAR) Price Signal Hints at a Breakout Ahead HBAR is currently positioned just under a long-standing trendline from March, trading near the $0.162 resistance mark. This level has been tested three times in recent days, but hasn’t broken yet. However, there’s reason to stay alert, RSI is forming higher lows while the price remains steady or slightly lower since mid-June. This pattern of divergence is an important Hedera (HBAR) price signal, often signaling a potential price breakout. If HBAR moves above $0.162, analysts point to $0.178 and $0.217 as the next targets. On the other hand, if resistance holds again, the price could revisit $0.143, a lower support zone and another key area to monitor. SEI Short-Term Analysis Signals a Rally Setup The SEI short-term analysis reveals signs of a rally building. On the weekly chart, SEI is holding above long-term support and approaching the $0.28 resistance line. If the price can break through, it may pave the way for a jump to $1.00, a potential 288% gain from current levels. Zooming in, SEI’s 4-hour chart displays a descending triangle forming between the $0.245 and $0.250 support range. This setup often leads to a breakout. If SEI moves past $0.28, a quick push to $0.3475, about a 30% rise, becomes a realistic short-term target. BlockDAG Teams Up with Seattle Seawolves to Expand Reach in Sports BlockDAG has taken another major step by becoming the official blockchain partner of the Seattle Seawolves, one of the standout teams in Major League Rugby. This isn’t just about marketing; fans will get hands-on with blockchain content like digital collectibles and tradable tokens. The partnership also includes a co-branded content series on the Seawolves’ social media, featuring match highlights, player insights, and behind-the-scenes access powered by BlockDAG. This move helps bridge Web3 technology with real-world audiences. The BlockDAG presale has already raised over $336 million, selling more than 23.8 billion coins. This new partnership is expected to further drive visibility, helping the project inch closer to its $600 million presale goal. Market watchers say the coin could hit $1 after launch, putting it firmly in the top bullish crypto category. Right now, Batch 29 is open with the BDAG price at a special $0.0016. This price remains locked until the upcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. With a confirmed launch price of $0.05, that’s a potential return of 3,025% for those who buy in now. Following the Seawolves announcement, interest in Batch 29 has surged, and available supply is quickly shrinking. This could be the final opportunity to join before prices move up. Which Project Looks Like the Top Bullish Crypto for 2025? The recent Hedera (HBAR) price signal shows a breakout might be coming soon, with strong RSI divergence and clear targets ahead. SEI’s technicals are also setting up well, and the SEI short-term analysis points to a possible quick jump if resistance breaks at $0.28. But among all three, BlockDAG stands out as the top bullish crypto to watch. Its partnership with the Seattle Seawolves proves it’s not just talk, it’s delivering real adoption and expanding its reach. Add in the $336 million raised, growing mining community, and the 3,025% ROI locked in for presale buyers, and BlockDAG looks well-positioned for explosive growth. The current $0.0016 price won’t be available for long. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release set for August 11, this may be the last window to secure one of the highest-ROI opportunities of 2025.

Equity-heavy compensation structures are driving up totals and drawing increasing shareholder resistance, according to new findings from VanEck. Miner CEOs Outpace Tech and Energy Peers Across eight miners that VanEck reviewed – Bit Digital, Cipher Mining, CleanSpark, Core Scientific, Hut 8, Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms, and TeraWulf – executive pay averaged $14.4 million in 2024. This is more than double the previous year’s $6.6 million, and significantly above averages in the energy and technology sectors. Such a surge has occurred even as base salaries for mining executives remain broadly in line with other industries, averaging $474,000 in 2023. The primary driver is the sector’s reliance on stock-based compensation, which accounted for 89% of miner executive pay in 2024, compared to lower allocations in comparable sectors. While stock-based incentives can align management with investors, VanEck’s analysis indicates many miners continue to structure these awards with short- to medium-term vesting, limited performance gating, and dilution risks that erode shareholder value. Shareholders appear to be pushing back. Across broader corporate America, nearly 99% of executive pay proposals passed during the 2024 proxy season, while S&P 500 and Russell 3000 companies typically witness 90% or higher support rates. By contrast, Bitcoin miners saw an average support rate of just 64%. Six of the eight miners, including Riot, Core Scientific, Hut 8, Cipher, TeraWulf, and Marathon, have expanded the use of performance stock units (PSUs). These typically vest over multiple years, tied to share price or total shareholder return benchmarks. Marathon has transitioned fully to PSUs in 2025, and Cipher now uses a 50/50 split between restricted stock units and PSUs. Core Scientific reintroduced its long-term incentive plan with performance-linked stock after reorganization. These changes indicate a move away from purely time-based vesting and toward longer-term alignment, although not all firms have fully adopted these practices. CleanSpark, for one, has not implemented PSUs. The same is true for Bit Digital as well. Despite authorizing them, it has yet to issue them according to its latest filings. Pay-for-Performance Misalignment The question of whether these pay structures are delivering value remains. VanEck’s comparison of total executive pay with each miner’s 2024 market-cap growth shows stark contrasts. At TeraWulf and Core Scientific, executive pay amounted to around 2% of the firms’ market-cap increases. This pointed to relatively efficient pay-for-performance alignment. On the other hand, Riot’s executives received $230 million, which is equivalent to 73% of the company’s 2024 market-cap gains, while Marathon’s executive pay was 18% of its market-cap growth. Such disparities have drawn scrutiny, particularly given Riot’s history of shareholder pushback on pay proposals and concerns over dilution tied to expanding equity compensation plans.

This is the rocket company’s first known investment in xAI and one of its biggest investments in any outside company. Elon has been using his businesses to fuel xAI’s growth since the company launched. Earlier this year, he combined xAI with X, the platform previously known as Twitter. That merger turned a small AI lab into a larger company that could use the reach of a major social platform to push its products. The newly merged company was valued at $113 billion. Grok launches new version while xAI faces backlash Elon has been focusing on training Grok, xAI’s chatbot, which just rolled out its latest version, Grok 4. He called it “the smartest AI in the world” during the launch, after it earned top marks from benchmarking group Artificial Analysis. But the rollout hasn’t been smooth. Grok made headlines for posting racist and offensive responses to users on X. In a public apology, xAI said, “We deeply apologize for the horrific behavior that many experienced,” and added that the issue had been investigated and actions were taken to address it. Despite that, Elon is moving forward. During the same launch, he revealed plans to embed Grok into Tesla’s humanoid robots, Optimus. He didn’t give a timeline, but the goal is to make Grok the AI system that runs the robots. Grok is already being used in one of Elon’s other companies. It powers customer service features for Starlink, the satellite internet service run by SpaceX, as reported by The Wall Street Journal . According to investors who spoke with Elon’s team, more collaborations between SpaceX and xAI are expected. SpaceX takes on new risks while xAI burns cash This isn’t the first time Elon has tapped SpaceX to support another company he owns. Years ago, he borrowed $20 million from SpaceX to help fund Tesla. He also used SpaceX equipment to launch The Boring Company. In 2022, around the time he bought Twitter, he took out a $1 billion loan from SpaceX, which he later repaid. The $2 billion investment comes at a time when SpaceX is already pouring money into the development of its new rocket, Starship. The project is behind schedule and has hit multiple roadblocks this year, including three failed test flights and an engine test that ended in a major explosion. Still, the company had over $3 billion in cash on hand recently, according to The Wall Street Journal . SpaceX rarely backs outside companies. One of the few times it did was in 2021, when it bought a satellite communications firm for $524 million. This xAI deal is on a much larger scale, and it ties the rocket firm more deeply into Elon’s AI ambitions, just as the AI industry becomes more competitive and expensive. xAI is burning through billions to train models, just like other startups in the field. The company raised $5 billion in debt alongside its equity fundraising. One of the investors told the Journal that even more fundraising is expected later this year. Elon left his White House advisory role under Trump’s administration after their breakup and has seemingly moved his focus fully to building up xAI. While the company has attracted big valuation numbers, it still faces pressure from better-known rivals and a need for constant capital.

The MACD indicator and other oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) have all pointed upwards. Therefore, the token will likely keep rising as bulls target the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level at $0.00003440. A drop below the support at $0.00002080, the 23.6% retracement level will invalidate the bullish Bonk price forecast.

One of those that did that was Alpaca Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) product for leveraged products. Alpaca Finance is a crypto project offering leveraged yield farming products. It helps lenders earn safe and stable yields and offers undercollateralized loans for leveraged yield farming positions. Alpaca Finance recently announced that it would shut down its platform following the delisting from Binance. Alpaca Finance 🦙δ0 @AlpacaFinance · Follow After extensive internal deliberation and a thorough evaluation of possible paths forward, we have made the incredibly difficult decision to begin sunsetting Alpaca Finance and all of its products.

This surge was likely because of the Wyckoff Theory, in which it has now moved into the markup phase. The MACD indicator is about to do a bullish crossover, while the Relative Strength Index has moved to the overbought level. Therefore, the ALPACA price will likely resume the downtrend as the network’s final days arrive.

It is a top player in decentralized finance that has handled over $20 billion in volume over time. Kyber Network recently launched KyberSwap Crosschain, a platform that enables swaps across multiple protocols. The daily chart shows that the KNC price went through a short-squeeze, surging from a low of $0.2684 on July 1 to $0.7686, its highest level since December 9. The surge happened after the token formed a falling wedge pattern, a popular bullish reversal pattern. This rally, which happened without any catalyst, will likely be short-lived, which may see it drop to the key support at $0.4265, its highest point on May 12.

At the same time, the Near Protocol (NEAR) price trend remains cautious, hovering near $2.00 as traders look for signals pointing toward a climb to $4.66 or more. Yet, what’s pulling the spotlight right now is BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles, a unique presale mechanic that has already pushed total funding beyond $337 million. Every day, 50 million BlockDAG (BDAG) coins are put on offer, and whatever remains unsold goes directly to the wallet with the highest daily purchase. With the price still frozen at $0.0016 and a 3,025% return on the table at launch, these Buyer Battles are setting BlockDAG apart as the best crypto to buy right now. DOGE Gains 6.6% as Traders Watch Key Level Dogecoin (DOGE) rose 6.6% on July 7 to hit $0.1743, fueled by large buys from whales and growing interest among retail participants. Still, the charts remain mixed. DOGE sits inside a descending wedge pattern, and while $0.13 support has held firm, it continues to be tested. Some analysts warn that a breakdown below this level could invite further losses. Yet, DOGE has a history of bouncing back from this exact range. One market watcher noted similarities to previous price cycles where strong rallies followed slow consolidation phases. If history repeats, the Dogecoin price prediction could target $3.40 by the end of 2025. Traders remain cautious, but many are watching for that familiar reversal setup to play out. NEAR Holds $2 as Traders Await Breakout NEAR is trading just under $2.10, and its recent slip toward $2.00 has triggered mixed reactions from traders. While it remains above key support at $1.80, short-term indicators are leaning bearish. Despite this, analysts remain confident in NEAR’s mid-term outlook, with projections pointing toward $4.66 by year-end. Looking further out, some forecasts even target a Near Protocol price of $22.22 by 2031, assuming adoption and network upgrades continue. On the daily chart, though, the token is still in a wait-and-watch phase, holding steady, testing boundaries, and yet to confirm any breakout move. If bulls defend current levels, a reversal could unfold. Until then, NEAR stays on the radar, but without firm direction. BlockDAG Buyer Battles Boost Presale Momentum BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles are reshaping how presales generate traction. Every 24 hours, 50 million BDAG coins are up for sale, and any unpurchased amount is rewarded to the top wallet of the day. This adds a layer of strategy and reward without extra cost, attracting both new and repeat participants. In one round, a buyer gained over a million BDAG simply by finishing at the top when the timer ran out. With the price locked at $0.0016 until August 11 and the launch price set at $0.05, the return potential stands at a massive 3,025%. These daily contests don’t just boost holdings, they also lower the average cost per coin. That’s why more and more people see BlockDAG as the best crypto to buy right now. Each contest resets at midnight UTC, creating fresh opportunities daily. As of now, over $337 million has been raised and 23.8 billion BDAG coins have been sold. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release coming up fast, Buyer Battles offer an extra edge, letting users stack more coins before pricing changes. While some remain on the sidelines, those actively participating are gaining traction day by day. Summing Up! DOGE holds its ground, though technicals suggest traders should stay cautious. NEAR is moving through a key price range, with big-picture targets in sight but no strong short-term signals yet. BlockDAG, however, is breaking ahead. With Buyer Battles bringing daily incentives and returns projected at 3,025%, it’s delivering value and excitement beyond the standard presale model. Still priced at $0.0016 and packed with rewards, BlockDAG is shaping up to be the best crypto to buy right now for those looking to grow their position before the official launch.

But that early move has now left officials in Hanoi and major manufacturers facing more confusion than clarity. Vietnam was one of only two countries to strike a last-minute agreement before the deadline, avoiding the initial 46% tariff threat. Trump publicly announced the new blanket rate at 20%. Still, no full agreement has been released, and neither side has explained the fine print, leaving businesses without answers just weeks ahead of an August 1 reset. Thanh Cong Garment, a key Vietnamese supplier for companies like Adidas, Columbia, and Calvin Klein, expected relief. Instead, it’s stuck in limbo. Company chair Tran Nhu Tung said there’s no certainty whether the 20% tariff will apply to all goods or increase for products made with Chinese materials. “For the products that [have] materials from China but manufactured in Vietnam, what is the tariff to export to the US? 20 per cent or 30 per cent or 35 per cent?” Tung asked . “We need to wait.” The issue is not hypothetical. Vietnam’s garment industry depends on China for about 70% of its raw materials, including zippers, cotton yarn, and elastic. Unclear transshipment clause triggers panic in factories A clause in the Trump deal threatens to apply a 40% tariff on “transshipped” goods. But no one has defined what transshipment means. The Vietnamese government hasn’t offered clarification, and the U.S. hasn’t released any details either. This has raised fears among manufacturers that goods containing Chinese components—even if legally assembled in Vietnam—will get hit with heavier tariffs. Rich McClellan, founder of RMAC Advisory, which advises both companies and Vietnam’s government, said, “There is a sigh of relief that at least we know what the answer is for Vietnam . . . but there is still quite a lot of uncertainty in the agreement that exists right now.” He called the transshipment clause “the most ambiguous and most potentially risky portion of this agreement.” Economist Michael Wan from MUFG said the impact of the 40% clause depends on how far the Trump administration takes its definition. If it targets blatant cases like fake “Made in Vietnam” labeling, the damage may be limited. But if it’s based on foreign material thresholds, then Vietnamese exports could take a serious hit. Vietnam’s manufacturing sector has been built around serving U.S. demand. Nearly one-third of all Vietnamese exports go to the U.S., and its 2024 trade surplus with America hit $123 billion, making it the third-largest behind China and Mexico. Now, that success is being viewed with suspicion in Washington, especially since almost one in three new manufacturing projects in Vietnam last year were funded by Chinese investors. Hanoi scrambles for clarity before August deadline Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh met with the U.S.-Asean Business Council in Hanoi on Friday to push for clearer terms. The group represents companies like Apple, Amazon, and Boeing. Pham asked the council to support Vietnam’s efforts to finalize a full agreement, lower the tariff rate, and prevent actions that damage trade relations. Trump’s public announcement caught Vietnamese leaders off guard. Pham said the countries had agreed on a framework but warned that detailed rates for specific products were still missing. He also asked U.S. companies to push the White House to recognize Vietnam as a market economy, which would help reduce pressure from trade defense tools. As of now, investors haven’t pulled back. Foreign direct investment in Vietnam rose almost 30% to $21.5 billion in the first half of the year. But U.S. retailers are already sounding alarms. Steve Greenspon, founder of Honey-Can-Do, said: “A 20 per cent tariff will result in higher prices and inflation on goods. This will certainly lead to reduced demand for goods, hurting American businesses and jobs.” Thanh Cong Garment has already seen a drop of 15–20% in U.S. orders for the third quarter, due to a shipping rush before the July deadline and the wait for clarification. Vietnam’s early move may have helped it avoid the worst threats from Washington—for now. But with no full text, no product list, and no guarantee of better terms than its neighbors, the final outcome is still unknown.

By 2028, $TRUMP could reach a maximum price of $46.44. In 2031, $TRUMP will range between $69.66 to $75.47. The Official Trump coin ($TRUMP) was launched on January 17, 2025, just three days before the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump.

Subsequent unlocks are scheduled over the next three (3) years. $Trump token unlock roadmap Trump’s “advocacy” for digital assets reforms boosted interest in $TRUMP in the first few days, driving it to an all-time high (ATH) of $75.35. Several other meme tokens, like the Official MELANIA coin, also rode the momentum. Despite the initial surge, Official Trump’s value has plunged to lower levels amidst shifting market sentiment and uproar around the legitimacy of a “President-owned Meme coin.” The price performance of Official Trump is down over 85% from its all-time high, raising questions among investors such as: How much will Trump coin be worth? Can Trump coin reach $100? This piece explores the Official trump price predictions for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Official Trump Token $TRUMP Price $9.62 Market Capitalization $1,924,722,828 Trading Volume $442,288,797 Circulating Supply 199.99M TRUMP All-time High $75.35 (January 19, 2025) All-time Low $1.21 (January 18, 2025) 24-h High $9.89 24-h Low $9.42 Official Trump technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 5.40% 14-Day RSI 53.72 50-Day SMA $10.30 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA No Data Official Trump Coin ($TRUMP) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown TRUMP’s $10.30 resistance remains critical. Higher lows pattern suggests accumulation phase with bullish potential. The 4-hour chart shows consolidation between $9.60-$9.80 with neutral momentum. Official Trump coin 1-day price analysis: $TRUMP consolidates below $10 after strong rally The daily chart for TRUMP/USDT as of July 13 shows the token in a consolidation phase after a sharp rally earlier this week. Price surged close to the $8.30 support zone, broke through multiple resistance levels, and tapped a high of $10.40 before facing rejection. Currently, $TRUMP is holding around $9.66, sitting within a short-term consolidation range between $9.37 and $9.99. This sideways movement suggests a cooling-off period after an aggressive upward momentum. The MACD remains in positive territory. Meanwhile, the OBV (On-Balance Volume) has flattened after rising steeply during the rally, signaling that although buying volume has slowed, distribution remains limited. TRUMP/USDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The brief dip in price appears to be driven primarily by profit-taking at key resistance levels like $9.99 and $10.27 rather than a fundamental shift in trend. As long as $TRUMP holds above $9.37, bulls remain in control. A breakout above $9.99 could open the door for another test of $10.27, and potentially new highs. However, if support at $9.37 breaks, the price could revisit $8.97 or even $8.30 for a deeper correction. Official Trump 4-hour price analysis: $TRUMP sees consolidation after parabolic rally failure The 4-hour chart displays a classic parabolic rally that peaked around $10.30 before encountering strong resistance, and is currently trading around $9.65. The price action shows a distinct three-phase pattern: an initial consolidation around $8.60, followed by an aggressive upward move that broke through the middle Bollinger band, and finally a sharp rejection from the $10.30 resistance level that has led to sideways consolidation between $9.60-$9.80. TRUMP/USDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The Bollinger Bands indicate the market is transitioning from an expansion phase back into contraction, suggesting volatility is decreasing after the recent spike. The Balance of Power oscillator at 0.50 shows neutral momentum, indicating neither buyers nor sellers are in clear control, which aligns with the current consolidation pattern and suggests the market is waiting for the next directional catalyst. $TRUMP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $9.72 SELL SMA 5 $9.60 BUY SMA 10 $9.09 BUY SMA 21 $9.05 BUY SMA 50 $9.96 SELL SMA 100 $10.65 SELL SMA 200 No Data No Data Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $9.63 BUY EMA 5 $9.52 BUY EMA 10 $9.30 BUY EMA 21 $9.28 BUY EMA 50 $9.91 SELL EMA 100 $11.88 SELL EMA 200 No Data No Data What to expect from $TRUMP price analysis TRUMP sits at a critical $10.30 resistance level that will determine the next major move, with a break above targeting $11.00-$11.50, while failure could trigger a retest of $8.30 support. Technical indicators suggest consolidation is likely, though the approaching MACD bullish crossover favors bulls. Is Official Trump a good investment? Meme coins like $TRUMP are volatile and driven by hype, not fundamentals. While they can offer big rewards, they come with high risk and uncertainty. If you’re making an investment decision on TRUMP coin, do your own research carefully and prepare for price swings. Why is $TRUMP down? $TRUMP plunged hard post‑launch, now rattling in a tight $9–11 consolidation as traders wait for new hype or a breakdown. With most tokens controlled by insiders, sentiment remains weak, and only fresh utility or momentum could revitalize it. Official Trump coin price history by Coingecko Will Official Trump reach $50 soon? The coin’s price momentum supports a move back up to $50 in the near future. $TRUMP coin already saw this price point in January; increased investor interest could result in a quick resurgence. Will Official Trump reach $100? Having touched a peak price of $75.35 and a market cap of $15 billion in its first few weeks, the $100 milestone might not be much of a hurdle to scale, provided $TRUMP can recapture the momentum it had in its earlier days. Will $TRUMP reach $1000? For $TRUMP to reach $1000, its market cap would need to jump massively to about $200 billion. This would require significant growth and demand, making it highly unlikely in the near future. Does Official Trump have a good long-term future? The long-term future of the Official Trump Coin is uncertain. While it has gained attention, peaked at $75, and generated significant revenue, its success will depend on crypto market trends, investor confidence, and how it navigates regulatory challenges.

Briefly after launch, the euphoria of DJT’s inauguration drove the $TRUMP coin to an all-time high of $75.35. As expected, market players took profit, and the Official Trump coin lost momentum, hitting a low of $18.75 by February 1, a massive 75% drop in price. Further price declines followed, but $TRUMP showed some resilience, reaching a high of $24 by mid-February, albeit short-lived. The bears recaptured the market in the following months, and the Official Trump coin settled at lower prices – about $7 to $11 between March and April. $TRUMP hit a high of $16.28 by April ending but has since maintained an average price of about $11. At the time of writing, July 2025, the price of Official Trump coin is between $9.42 and $9.89.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION|BNB|ZRX,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-13 05:47:04

While it may be early to declare victory, all signs point to Trump signing a stablecoin measure into US law by August, a goal his aides have pursued since February. Huge week ahead — it’s Crypto Week in the House! GENIUS heads to the President’s desk. Clarity moves to the Senate. Time to make America the Crypto Capital of the World. 🇺🇸💥 — Bo Hines (@BoHines) July 11, 2025 For years, crypto companies have pressed for clear rules that suit their business models. They fought previous regulatory proposals they opposed and invested several million dollars in campaigning during the recent elections, hoping to shape a more pro-crypto Congress. If next week’s votes go as expected, those efforts could finally bear fruit. A bill for stablecoins could become law in weeks, while a market structure measure might reach the Oval by the end of 2025. Crypto week runs from July 14 through July 18 Legislators have dubbed the proceedings “ Crypto Week , ” which runs from July 14 through 18. The agenda centers on three bills: the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025 (often called the Clarity Act), the Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act, and the GENIUS ( Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins ) Act. Earlier, lawmakers had considered combining the GENIUS Act and Clarity Act, but they now appear ready to vote on each bill separately. The House Rules Committee will review and discuss each bill on Monday at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Observers say all bills are likely to pass with support from both parties. The Clarity Act sets out how various cryptocurrencies should be regulated by agencies like the SEC and the CFTC. It sailed through the House Agriculture Committee by 47–6 and passed the Financial Services Committee by 32–19, signaling broad backing. The GENIUS Act establishes a stablecoin framework. The Senate already approved it, so House passage would send it directly to the president, making it the first big law on crypto to be written in the books. This act could head to President Trump’s desk by Friday, July 18, or the following Monday, though that timeline depends entirely on the House vote. The Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act prohibits the United States from creating or issuing a central bank digital currency. A separate version of the bill was passed by the House in 2024. What does it mean for stablecoins? If these bills become law, it would be an overall positive sign for stablecoins and the crypto industry. Still, it could take months or even years for lawmakers to draft detailed rules and for businesses to adapt. A recent Moody’s Ratings report warned that while the GENIUS Act could have a significant impact on the banks, stablecoins must offer real advantages over existing payment systems before gaining broad use. Moody’s added that without incentives from issuers, widespread adoption is unlikely. Some Democrats have voiced worries that these measures could open the door to ethical conflicts. Representative Stephen Lynch and Maxine Waters pointed to President Trump’s crypto dealings as a potential conflict of interest. Waters said in a statement: “These bills serve as a brazen stamp of approval for the blatant abuse of power we’re witnessing in real time.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",Regulation|USDC|USDT,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|USDC|USDT|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-13 05:50:02

Meanwhile, institutional interest has surged, particularly in the form of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw more than $1 billion in inflows on both Thursday and Friday — a back-to-back milestone never previously achieved. Institutional Surge Behind Latest Price Move Bitwise head of research André Dragosch observed in a Friday post that although Bitcoin is soaring, mainstream interest has yet to catch up. “Bitcoin is at new all-time highs but retail is almost nowhere to be found,” he wrote, referencing data showing weak Google search trends for the term “Bitcoin.” This suggests the current rally is primarily fueled by institutions, not individual investors. Search Trends Fail to Reflect Price Surge Google Trends data supports this narrative. Between June 29–July 5 and July 6–12, global searches for “Bitcoin” increased by just 8%, even as Bitcoin’s price broke past its previous all-time high of $111,970 and continued climbing to $118,780 by Friday. This subdued retail interest contrasts sharply with the surge seen in November 2024, when search interest peaked following Donald Trump’s election win. At that time, retail engagement helped propel Bitcoin past the $100,000 mark for the first time. Retail Sentiment: “Missed the Boat” Some crypto commentators believe that retail investors are sitting out because they feel priced out of the market. “I think a lot of retail folks find out the price of one Bitcoin is 117k and think, nahhh I missed the boat and don’t even give it a second thought,” said Bitcoin analyst Lindsay Stamp. Cedric Youngelman, host of the Bitcoin Matrix podcast, shared a similar sentiment, asking his followers, “At what Bitcoin price do you think retail wakes up? I’ll go first. I don’t think they’re coming for a long time.” Analysts Say Rally Still Has Momentum Despite low retail participation, market experts believe the current rally has more room to run. Bitcoin on-chain analyst Willy Woo commented, “This run has plenty of legs left in it.” The continued interest from institutional players suggests that Bitcoin’s momentum is far from over. Spot ETFs Remain the Main Driver Spot Bitcoin ETFs had an exceptionally strong week, pulling in a total of $2.72 billion over five trading days, according to Farside data. This wave of capital suggests institutional demand remains robust. However, the trend has raised questions about how to measure actual retail interest in the current market landscape. Cointelegraph recently noted that if the ultimate holders of Bitcoin ETF shares are retail investors, then interpreting on-chain data could become more complex. Conclusion While Bitcoin continues to scale new heights, the retail crowd appears hesitant to reenter the market. Whether due to price anxiety or market fatigue, their absence is notable — especially in contrast to the flood of institutional capital pouring into ETFs. As the rally unfolds, attention now turns to whether retail investors will follow — or continue to watch from the sidelines.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-07-13 05:51:50

In a post shared on X, Marks presented a chart suggesting that XRP may be on the verge of replicating a historical breakout pattern. XRP is Repeating Historical Patterns The chart highlights XRP’s price action over the past decade, with two notable consolidation phases similar to symmetrical triangle patterns . The first phase, spanning from 2014 to 2017, preceded a rapid move that took XRP to its all-time high of $3.84. According to Marks’ chart, the current consolidation, which began after XRP’s 2018 peak, reached its apex in late 2024 and recently resolved in an upward direction. $XRP 's history still points to the next leg up leading into $9.631+, if not WELL beyond! That's another +251% from here… pic.twitter.com/xS0hU635Dq — JAVON MARKS (@JavonTM1) July 11, 2025 Fibonacci Levels Signal Higher Targets Marks identified Fibonacci extension levels as key markers in the chart. The initial breakout in 2017 saw XRP consolidate briefly at the Fib. 1 extension level. Following this phase, it climbed to the 1.618 extension, before eventually exceeding the 2.618 level. The latest formation shows similar behavior as XRP has been consolidating above $1.99 (Fib. 1) for months. The chart shows the upcoming Fibonacci levels, with Marks noting the 1.618 target at approximately $9.631 and a 2.618 extension suggesting a potential move toward $123.5278. In his post, Marks stated that “history still points to the next leg up leading into $9.631+, if not well beyond,” describing this as a potential gain of 251% from current prices. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 At the time of his analysis, XRP traded at $2.58. Although $123.5278 is a lofty target, other well-known experts have shared triple-digit XRP targets , and historical trends and proper technical analysis back Marks’ analysis. Potential Implications for XRP’s Future Marks’ also highlights multiple support touches during consolidation, signaling a strengthening base before the recent breakout. The targets reflect a highly optimistic scenario for the digital asset, but align perfectly with its 2017 performance. While the analysis does not offer a specific timeline for reaching these targets, it positions XRP’s current market structure as a potential precursor to significant gains. Following the 2017 pattern could lead to substantial gains for XRP holders, and the technical setup presented provides a clear framework for understanding the asset’s next steps.

She was boxed out of it. That’s the view now flooding the ad world after the former NBCUniversal executive announced her exit from X, Elon Musk’s messy social platform. Her departure was no surprise to anyone still paying attention, because the truth is, she was never meant to succeed in the first place. According to the Financial Times , the warning signs were there from the very beginning, long before Elon merged X with his AI company, xAI, and long before Linda said in public that she was still CEO, which turned out to be false. She got the top job in 2023 with one goal: bring advertisers back to a platform Elon had turned radioactive. His “go fuck yourself” message to brands that pulled their spending after his $44 billion takeover was still echoing. Linda had the contacts, the polish, and the track record to try. But she never had the power. She was tasked with cleaning up a mess created by someone who wasn’t going to let her actually run anything. Elon stripped her power behind the scenes From the start, Elon micromanaged decisions, especially in advertising, which was supposed to be Linda’s turf. Brian Wieser of Madison & Wall said once Elon folded X into xAI for $45 billion, Linda had to ask herself why she was still showing up to work. By then, Elon was making solo calls, like banning hashtags in ads, changing how pricing worked, and appointing Nikita Bier as head of product without consulting her. She was publicly saying things were normal. In an interview at the Cannes ad festival three weeks before she quit, Linda claimed, “I’m the CEO of X and my boss remains the same.” But insiders allegedly told the Financial Times her title meant nothing by then. “Elon calls all the shots,” said one executive familiar with the situation. Others said she never managed to build the working chemistry Elon wanted. “Sheryl found the rhythm with Mark,” one person explained. “Linda couldn’t find the rhythm with Elon.” Things got worse when Elon brought in longtime lieutenant Steve Davis to tear through X’s finances, then brought on Mahmoud Reza Banki as CFO. Banki didn’t report to Linda, he dealt directly with Elon. People familiar with the company said Linda and Banki clashed hard. She wanted funds for creator payouts and better ad tech. Banki wanted to cut spending and reroute investment elsewhere. She was out of the loop in her own department. Ad wins came with lawsuits, not loyalty To fix X’s revenue problem, Linda took a scorched-earth approach. She hauled big brands like Shell and Pinterest into court, accusing them of illegally boycotting X. She also sued their trade group. Brian Wieser said brands only returned “to avoid an X legal challenge.” Even the ones who came back didn’t want to be there. “She did it with a gun,” said one longtime ad executive. Still, she landed deals with Google, Dell, Apple, Temu, Amazon , and Verizon. Research firm Emarketer said X will hit $2.3 billion in revenue this year, up from $1.9 billion. But that’s still a long drop from 2022’s $4.1 billion before Elon stepped in. Even outside of ads, Linda pushed ahead. She launched X Money, a peer-to-peer payment service expected later this year, boosted video content, and made creator deals. Those efforts got no runway once Elon re-entered the picture after months working with Trump in Washington. By then, his return meant her days were numbered. “Now that he’s back into his businesses, he was never going to put her to be the head of an AI company at all,” one person said. The lemon fallout exposed the real cracks In early 2024, Linda brokered a deal with Don Lemon for new content on X. But Elon canceled it after Lemon asked him in an interview whether he abused drugs. That fallout led to a lawsuit and worsened Linda’s already fragile standing. Staff described her as often tearful. She never spoke publicly against Elon. But privately, she thought he wasn’t focused enough on safety issues, which were high on her list. She quietly told close colleagues she was leaving. Around the same time, xAI’s chatbot Grok posted antisemitic content, which staff said wasn’t connected, but didn’t help the situation either. Neither X nor Linda commented, and Elon ignored questions about the exit. What comes next for Linda is uncertain. She’s a longtime Republican and close with Trump’s circle. She knows Ivanka Trump personally and has strong ties to Scott Turner and Tulsi Gabbard. Some think she’ll end up in the administration or as a “free speech” advocate — a direction she hinted at when she began wearing a diamond “Free Speech” necklace last year. Trump ally Mike Benz, now running a speech watchdog group, praised her on X: “She stepped up for all of us in the face of what seemed like insurmountable pressure.” Linda reposted it. Lou Paskalis, CEO of AJL Advisory, summed up her situation this way: “She doesn’t need to work, but she needs to go out in style. And I think that’s what’s next for her.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",Tech|X,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-13 06:10:36

The GBP/USD exchange rate dropped to a low of 1.3490, its lowest level since June 23. It has plunged by over 2.17% from its highest point this year. US Dollar Index rises The GBP/USD exchange rate has plunged in the past few days as the US Dollar Index (DXY) bounced back. Data shows that the DXY Index rose to $97.86 on Friday, up sharply from the year-to-date low of $96.35. The dollar index’s surge has coincided with the rebound of the US bond yields. Data shows that the ten-year yield jumped to 4.417%, its highest level since June 20, and much higher than this month’s low of 4.20%. The rally happened after the US published strong jobs numbers earlier this month. These numbers showed that the economy created over 147k jobs in June, higher than 144k in the previous month. Most notably, the data showed that the unemployment rate dropped to 4.1% from 4.3% previously. Following these reports, the odds that the Federal Reserve would slash interest rates this month plunged sharply. The next key catalyst for the GBP/USD exchange rate will be the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data on Wednesday. Economists expect the data to show that inflation rose modestly in June. They expect the report to show that prices of goods and services, excluding food and energy, rose 0.3% in June, the biggest jump in five months. Analysts also expect the data to show that the core CPI jumped to 2.9% in June. A strong inflation report will lower the chances of the Federal Reserve slashing interest rates in September, as many analysts anticipate. The US will publish the latest retail sales data on Thursday. Economists expect the data to reveal that retail sales rose modestly during the month. This is an important metric that will provide more color on the second quarter economic growth. UK inflation data The next important catalyst for the GBP/USD exchange rate will be the upcoming UK inflation data. Economists expect the report to show that the headline consumer price index (CPI) remained unchanged at 3.4%. The core consumer inflation report, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, is also expected to have remained unchanged at 3.5% during the month. The UK will also publish the latest retail sales data, which will also provide more information about the economy. Analysts expect that the BoE may hold interest rates steady in the upcoming meeting if inflation continues rising. GBP/USD technical analysis GBP/USD chart by TradingView The daily chart shows that the sterling pound has been in a strong bull run in the past few months, surging from a low of 1.2100 in January to a high of 1.3785 earlier this year. Most recently, the pair has formed an ascending channel and is now approaching its lower side. The pair has remained above the crucial support level at 1.3428, the upper side of the cup-and-handle pattern. Sterling remains above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). Therefore, the GBP/USD pair will likely drop and retest the upper side of the cup and then resume the uptrend.

The pattern was shared on X by Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a well-respected analyst in the XRP community, and it illustrates a shift in momentum following months of consolidation and a prolonged downtrend. The first bottom in this structure formed in mid-April 2025 when XRP dropped to approximately $1.65. After rebounding and failing to breach resistance around $2.6, the price retraced, reaching a second bottom near $1.9 in early June. This double dip established a firm support level and laid the groundwork for the current reversal setup. #XRP DOUBLE BOTTOM BREAKOUT! pic.twitter.com/DJ3sflq4RT — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) July 11, 2025 Following the second bottom, XRP began a strong ascent through late June and early July, eventually testing the neckline resistance at roughly $2.6. As shown in the chart, the most recent candle has now closed above this level, indicating a potential breakout . The move above this critical zone marks the first clear break of the neckline since the pattern began forming in March and may signal the beginning of a larger upward trend. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Structure and Targets The double bottom structure shared by Steph is well-defined. The asset tested a narrow support zone twice with minimal deviation, while the neckline at $2.6 remained a consistent ceiling throughout April to early July. With the breakout above that level now in place, the technical projection for this pattern points toward upside targets in the $3.4–$4 range, potentially hitting a new all-time high . These targets are derived by measuring the vertical distance from the base ($1.75) to the neckline ($2.6) and applying it above the breakout level. This method aligns with standard technical practice and is often used to estimate the potential scale of a reversal. Significance of the 3-Day Breakout The use of the 3-day timeframe adds to the significance of the pattern. Breakouts on higher timeframes are generally seen as more reliable than those on shorter intervals, as they reflect broader market positioning and reduced noise. In this case, the close above $2.6 suggests the potential for sustained bullish momentum, provided the level holds on a retest. A prominent analyst recently predicted that rising above $2.6 would send XRP to $3 . The asset is currently trading at $2.79, well above this resistance, and on its way to much higher levels. If XRP remains above this former resistance, the double bottom can be considered confirmed. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Although the platform completed the public sale in 12 minutes, there are some controversies surrounding it. Data from the Pump.fun token website shows that the launchpad raised $500 million during the sale. The platform sold 12.5% of the PUMP total supply for $0.0040 each in a public offering. Speculation Around Pump.fun ICO When announcing the ICO on July 9, Pump.fun said its native token will have a maximum supply of one trillion. 33% of the supply was to be sold at the ICO, 24% reserved for community and ecosystem initiatives, and 20% to the project’s team. The project allocated 13% to existing investors, and the rest in smaller percentages to the ecosystem fund, exchange liquidity, and live streaming. Out of the 33% allocated to the ICO, Pump.fun decided to keep 18% for a private sale to institutional buyers. The remaining 15%, accounting for 150 billion PUMP, will be offloaded in a public sale. However, data on the project’s website shows the team eventually offloaded only 12.5% of the supply in the public sale. At the time of writing, the firm has not published any update regarding the changes; hence, the community is speculating what could have happened to the remaining 2.5%. Tokens to be Tradeable in 72 Hours While the crypto community continues speculating, Pump.fun confirmed it has allocated the tokens kept for the private sale to their buyers. Users who participated in the public sale will receive their assets within the next 48-72 hours. However, they will not be tradable or transferable till the distribution phase is over. All ICO participants will be able to sell or transfer their PUMP allocations on the first day they become tradable. “We’d like to thank everyone who participated in the sale, whether on pump fun or on one of the participating exchanges, and we look forward to the very bright future of pump fun and the wider Solana ecosystem,” the platform stated . It is worth mentioning that Pump.fun faced a few challenges in the days leading up to the ICO. On July 8, the crypto exchange Gate.io abruptly removed its pre-market listing for PUMP and returned funds to all presale participants. The exchange eventually revealed that its decision stemmed from a discussion it had with the Pump.fun team. Notwithstanding the incident, PUMP ICO participants bought tokens worth $5 million on the exchange.

For now, it looks like the high-risk trader finally crashed out, as his personal X account has been deactivated. Searching for Wynn’s old username, “JamesWynnReal,” on X now returns an error message that says, “This account doesn’t exist.” Right before he deactivated his account, Wynn changed his profile description to “broke.” Wynn’s old X username returns an account error.

James Wynn( @JamesWynnReal ) has deactivated his X account! What happened? Did he blow up completely?

Due to this, Wynn received a lot of attention and scrutiny from fellow traders. His strategy relied on making high-leverage bets on Hyperliquid while enjoying the benefits of the resulting social media engagement. More often than not, the trader watched the market react opposite to his bet. Wynn lost hundreds of millions betting on BTC futures During May, Wynn’s position in BTC stood to lose roughly $100 million when Bitcoin’s price slipped below $105k. That triggered liquidations of 949 BTC, effectively erasing his long-BTC holdings. In a post he later removed, Wynn said, “I do not follow proper risk management, nor do I claim to be a professional; if anything, I claim to be lucky. I’m effectively gambling, and I stand to lose everything. I strongly advise people against what I’m doing.” Instead of slowing down, Wynn once again opened a $100 million bet days later. Wynn claimed that market makers were intentionally targeting his positions to force a liquidation. Seeking relief, he asked the community for help. Up to 24 unique wallet addresses sent donation funds to his account. Shortly after receiving those donations, Wynn sold 240 BTC to push down his liquidation price on his remaining positions. Still, the trader couldn’t save his position and ultimately lost over 99 percent of the second $100 million position. $198.68 million got liquidated from the broader crypto market in 24 hours Meanwhile, the broader crypto futures market saw massive liquidations over the last 24 hours. Liquidation data from CoinGlass at press time shows a total of $198.68 million wiped out in perpetual futures. Long positions accounted for $132.75 million of that total, while shorts made up $65.93 million. Ethereum traders felt the pinch as well, with $30.84 million in positions closed out. Of that, $21.14 million were longs and $9.26 million were shorts. XRP followed, tallying $16.89 million in liquidations, $13.27 million on the long side, and $3.62 million short.

Here’s the Next Target,https://timestabloid.com/last-time-this-happened-cardano-ada-surged-55-heres-the-next-target/,"A recent analysis by crypto market analyst Ali Martinez (@ali_charts) has raised interest in Cardano (ADA) after the digital asset revisited a historically significant price level. In a video posted on X, Martinez highlighted that Cardano has once again touched the $0.54 support level, a zone from which the asset previously surged 55%. His chart, which plots ADA’s 12-hour price action, suggests a similar rebound may now be underway. The chart shows a well-defined parallel channel that ADA has followed over the past several weeks. The lower boundary of this channel, around $0.54, appears to be holding as strong support. After dipping to this level, Cardano has shown early signs of recovery, trading at approximately $0.6264 at the time of the analysis. The analyst indicated that “a buying spike here could send Cardano to $0.84 like it did in April.” Notably, a Times Tabloid report predicted this target for ADA in March , and Martinez suggests that the asset could mirror this trajectory. The last time this happened, Cardano $ADA surged 55%! pic.twitter.com/G2B9fqOHzX — Ali (@ali_charts) July 11, 2025 Parallel Channel Continues to Guide Price Action Martinez’s chart captures ADA’s recent volatility, with oscillation between defined support and resistance levels. The price pattern shows several sharp reversals and failed breakouts, reinforcing the relevance of the horizontal levels outlined on the graph. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to Martinez’s projection, ADA could first retest the $0.68 range, then break through intermediate resistance near $0.75 before reaching the upper boundary near $0.84. The structure implies a stair-step recovery pattern contingent on renewed market interest and volume. ADA is currently trading at $0.7162, up almost 25% from last week. The asset is now aiming for the next resistance level before the final target. Another analyst previously revealed that breaking above $0.7 could open the door for further gains , and the expected momentum could help the asset reach and potentially surpass $0.84. Market Sentiment May Dictate Follow-Through While the setup resembles past bullish recoveries, execution will depend on broader market sentiment and Cardano’s ability to sustain upward momentum. Additionally, ADA has multiple bullish indicators that support the positive outlook. The asset recently formed its first weekly golden cross and has seen notable whale activity that suggests a big move in its immediate future. Martinez’s recent breakdown places Cardano at a critical juncture, and with support from the community and increasing bullish sentiment, the $0.84 target may be within reach once again.

A popular crypto analyst with almost 140,000 followers on X believes this could be just the beginning and envisioned a further surge to and beyond $1 if ADA breaks through a key resistance level, which is being tested now. Cardano $ADA is breaking through a key resistance level, opening the door for a rally to $0.90–$1.20! pic.twitter.com/4dj8jQfJFN — Ali (@ali_charts) July 13, 2025 This important resistance that could hinder ADA’s progress is situated somewhere around $0.74, a level the asset is very familiar with, as it managed to contain its price ascent earlier this year. ADA managed to breach it briefly during the Friday price surge that drove it to a two-and-a-half-month high of almost $0.78, but the bears quickly regrouped and didn’t allow a decisive closure above it. In fact, the last time Cardano’s token traded sustainably above $0.74 was in mid-May. Since then, the asset underwent a substantial correction that drove it down to $0.5 at one point. Nevertheless, ADA is still the top performer on a weekly scale from the 12 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, having gained almost 30%. Thus, it has increased more than XRP (26%) and HYPE (22%). This impressive price surge comes just a few weeks after IOG proposed that the treasury would trade $100 million worth of ADA for BTC and stablecoins to enhance the blockchain’s DeFi ecosystem. The move met immediate resistance from some members, who claimed that it could lead to a more painful sell-off and price declines. Charles Hoskinson was quick to mock the naysayers after ADA surged past $0.7 and became a top performer. Remember when we were told that a 100 million dollar trade of ada would collapse the price? https://t.co/kYm5CKw97O pic.twitter.com/tPZiROv37i — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) July 11, 2025 The post ADA Is Breaking Out: Will Cardano Surge Past $1 Next? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",ADABTC|ADAUSD|Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Cardano (ADA) Price,EN,0,0,ADA|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-07-13 06:51:54

In a new interview with CNBC Television, Fold CEO Will Reeves says that the top crypto asset by market cap’s recent new all-time high was due to a combination of high institutional demand and low supply. “This is what happens when massive demand meets the finite supply of Bitcoin. And what we’re seeing right now is the supply shock in motion. So I’d certainly say what we are seeing is the fundamentals of Bitcoin in play… What we’ve seen recently with the rise of Bitcoin treasury companies, the ETFs (exchange-traded funds) is that entirely new classes of capital are able to invest in the asset. What we’re seeing is what happens when trillions of dollars start knocking on the door – the price tends to go up.” According to Reeves, the market’s appetite for BTC will cause its dominance levels to irreversibly rise – a trend that would leave countless altcoins competing for capital. “Frankly, I think [altcoins] will remain speculative. Bitcoin dominance is at 60% and rising. I think what we’re seeing is an inevitable trend towards the signal, the apex asset. The issue is that Bitcoin is the only credibly neutral digital asset that is in issuance. All the other tokens are still proving extraordinarily speculative use cases without the track record of Bitcoin. And so what we are seeing today is the continued march of Bitcoin dominating this entire market… Ultimately, what we’ve seen is something that can’t be reversed.” Bitcoin is trading for $117,613 at time of writing, a sideways move on the day. Meanwhile, Bitcoin dominance, which measures how much of the total crypto market cap belongs to BTC, stands at 64.58%.

Crypto pundit Jungle Inc (@jungleincxrp) highlighted these developments in a recent post on X, and this potential rally is underpinned by strengthening technical indicators, increasing institutional support, and a surge in interest surrounding RLUSD. XRP Traders Now Eyeing $6 XRP is holding strong above $2.34, with analysts targeting a breakout to $2.65 — and possibly $4–$6 if key levels flip. This comes as Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD just smashed through a $500M market cap, ranking among the top 20 stablecoins… pic.twitter.com/P80HTRU1y8 — Jungle Inc Crypto News (@jungleincxrp) July 11, 2025 Accumulation Patterns and Whale Activity Support Bullish Outlook Over the past few months, XRP has shown signs of prolonged accumulation , according to analysts observing historical price consolidation. The asset has formed both a symmetrical triangle and a bull flag pattern , which are typically associated with impending upward movement. At the same time, tightening volatility bands and rising open interest in XRP derivatives suggest that a breakout move may be approaching. Market watchers also note steady whale accumulation , signaling strong confidence from large-scale holders. RLUSD’s Adoption Shows Institutional Backing The broader environment surrounding Ripple has also shifted. RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin, has now surpassed a $500 million market cap, placing it among the top 20 stablecoins globally. At press time, it was ranked #8, and with growing adoption, it could reach Ripple’s goal of joining the top 5 stablecoins before the end of 2025. RLUSD’s rapid adoption is also supported by significant institutional backing. Notably, BNY Mellon, one of the oldest custodians in the financial sector, is now providing custody solutions for RLUSD . Meanwhile, integrations with platforms like Transak and OpenPayd are expanding RLUSD’s utility in cross-border and crypto-fiat payment flows.

Beyond chart patterns, derivatives data shows growing participation. Open interest in XRP futures and options has steadily climbed since Q2 2025, aligning with increased volume and capital inflow into XRP-related markets. XRP Target: The $4 to $6 Range XRP has broken above the $2.65 resistance level, and Jungle Inc expects it to keep rising. A move to the $4 to $6 range would represent a 45% to 117% increase from its current price of $2.76. What separates the current market cycle from previous ones is the infrastructure surrounding XRP. This target is feasible if momentum continues, particularly with growing institutional support and technical indicators favoring a sustained bullish trend.
