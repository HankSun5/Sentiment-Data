By 2028, ADA/USD could decline and reach $2.63. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $8.61 Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.7066 Market Cap $21 Billion Trading Volume (24-hour) $677 Million Circulating Supply 45 Billion ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.7427 24-hour Low $0.6902 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 8.23% 50-day SMA $ 0.669534 14-Day RSI 47.74 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green Days 14/30 (47%) Cardano ADA recovers slightly ADA price analysis 1-day chart ADAUSD chart by TradingView Cardano (ADA) has shown a strong bullish rebound on the 1-day chart on. J, climbing to approximately $0.71. The RSI stands at 66.28, suggesting increasing bullish momentum but also approaching the overbought threshold, which often precedes short-term consolidation. The MACD remains positive, with the MACD line above the signal line, indicating sustained upward pressure. Bollinger Bands have widened with the price testing the upper band, reinforcing a volatile breakout move. If ADA maintains this strength, it could challenge the next resistance near $0.75 to $0.80. However, any pullback might retest the $0.68 zone as support before continuation or correction. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart ADAUSD chart by TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart of Cardano (ADA), the price has demonstrated a strong recovery, trading near $0.705. The Bollinger Bands show expansion with ADA testing the upper band, signaling bullish volatility. The Balance of Power (0.83) favors buyers, suggesting dominance of bullish sentiment. However, the MACD histogram reveals some waning momentum as the MACD line dips slightly below the signal line, hinting at short-term indecision. Despite this, the overall structure supports a continuation of the uptrend if ADA holds above $0.68. Failure to maintain momentum could trigger a correction toward the middle Bollinger Band near $0.67 for support.

On the 1-day chart, ADA has reclaimed the $0.70 zone and broken through the upper Bollinger Band, signaling heightened volatility and buyer strength. The RSI at 66.28 suggests ADA is approaching overbought territory but still has room to run. On the 4-hour chart, buyers remain in control, supported by a high Balance of Power (0.83) and expanding Bollinger Bands. If bulls sustain pressure above $0.68, ADA may target $0.75 next. A break below $0.68 could invite consolidation or retracement. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. What will Cardano be worth in 2025? ADA might reach a maximum price of $5.97, with an average trading price of about $5.17 and a minimum price of $5.03. What will Cardano be worth in 2030? In 2030, ADA’s average forecast price could be $5.82. Its minimum and maximum trading price is expected to be $5.63 and $6.75, respectively. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from $10 to $50 or more, if the cryptocurrency market continues to expand and Cardano establishes itself as a leader in blockchain technology. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. In a bullish scenario, ADA could reach $50 to $100 or even higher if it becomes a dominant blockchain platform with real-world utility in finance, governance, and enterprise solutions. However, in a bearish scenario where adoption stagnates or regulations hinder growth, ADA could remain below $10. The price will depend on mass adoption, technological advancements, global regulations, and overall cryptocurrency market trends over the coming decades. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2025, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Based on our analysis, Cardano will reach $5 by 2030, with a forecasted range of around $5.97. This projection is driven by Cardano’s continued technological advancements, growing adoption, strategic partnerships, and increasing market confidence, indicating a positive long-term growth trajectory for the cryptocurrency market. Will Cardano reach $10? ADA is predicted to reach $7.33 by 2031. By this time, the coin is expected to attain a maximum price of $8.61. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano is trading around $0.5823, with an all-time high of $2.80 in early 2021. While not impossible, reaching $50 in the next few years is highly uncertain. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. Predictions indicate that by 2030, Cardano could see significant growth, with estimates suggesting a rise to around $6.75. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges.

The allegation was reportedly made by another Indian exchange, WazirX, which has been under scrutiny since last year's $230 million hack . In an affidavit filed as part of the Singapore High Court proceedings (scheduled for a hearing on July 15, 2025), WazirX reportedly claimed that CoinDCX held user funds in a Lithuania-based entity that was not registered with India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) until February 2025. Gupta denied these allegations in a message to CoinDesk, stressing that his India-based users' INR and crypto funds have always been held by Neblio Technologies, our FIU-IND registered entity, which is fully compliant with all Indian laws. ""For the record: CoinDCX did not have any entity in Lithuania until Feb 2025. We only engaged with third-party entities to explore potential global expansion. No business was ever conducted by CoinDCX (Neblio Technologies) in Lithuania, and no user funds were ever moved to or held by any Lithuania-based entity,"" Gupta said. He added that the exchange updated its Terms of Use to make Neblio Technologies the formal contracting party on Feb. 7 this year, and the change was made to strengthen transparency and user trust. ""We did this proactively so that CoinDCX users never face challenges like those seen during the WazirX episode. This approach safeguards users’ interests, and we hope other Indian exchanges adopt the same standard,"" Gupta said, adding that the exchange ""remains committed, as always, to user safety, transparency, and regulatory compliance.",Policy|WazirX|India|Exclusive|News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|ASIA|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-12 20:29:22

Fueled by a record-setting short squeeze and ETF inflows, the breakout is triggering capital shifts across the market. SUI and Toncoin are showing signs of strength—but it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE, a decentralized political memecoin, that’s quietly entering buy-zone discussions among early-stage investors looking for high-conviction narratives in the next altcoin wave. Bitcoin’s Breakout Powered by Short Squeeze and ETF Inflows The Bitcoin rally has been nothing short of historic. Between July 10–11, over $1 billion in short positions were liquidated, marking the largest forced buyback event since January. Spot ETF inflows continue to accelerate, bringing institutional demand and long-term price pressure. Bitcoin 7-Days price chart from CoinGecko Market sentiment is bullish, with open interest now clustering at the $120K and $140K strike levels. U.S. legislators are also preparing pro-crypto bills as part of an upcoming “Crypto Week,” reinforcing optimism heading into Q3. But the more telling trend? Altcoin rotations are already underway—particularly toward early narratives and low-cap bets. SUI Holds Above $3.50 as DeFi Integrations Fuel Speculation SUI is emerging as one of the most technically robust altcoins this week. After integrating tBTC—a synthetic Bitcoin asset—into its DeFi ecosystem, SUI soared above $3.50 and confirmed its inverse head-and-shoulders breakout pattern. Analysts now point to $3.89 as the next resistance target, with institutional accumulation growing and daily volume tracking higher. It’s a clear indicator that DeFi-aligned narratives are back in focus, especially those with cross-asset bridges and liquidity inflows. But SUI’s surge is also creating spillover attention for projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE—those operating in entirely different lanes but benefiting from renewed risk appetite. TON Rebounds Near $2.97 After Visa Controversy Cools Down Toncoin (TON) is stabilizing near $2.97 after weathering a wave of investor uncertainty related to its failed “golden visa” pilot in the UAE. The TON Foundation clarified its limited role in the proposal, and traders are once again watching the charts. TON’s symmetrical triangle setup signals a potential volatility breakout. Support at $2.81 has held, and sentiment is slowly improving, although technical indicators remain mixed. Analysts caution that TON needs a clean break past $3.00 to resume its previous trend. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Political Altcoin Narrative Enters Buy-Zone Phase While BTC, SUI, and TON dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is making noise where it matters—wallets, volume, and forums. The meme-powered altcoin recently passed $11.2 million raised with over 5,234 verified holders. But what’s attracting fresh attention is the breakout behavior: weekly volume is up 320%, and 1,500+ new wallets were created in under 48 hours. MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t riding ETF news or protocol upgrades—it’s leading with ideological clarity. As a decentralized political memecoin, its zero-tax model, HashEx-audited contract, and capped 170B supply structure offer a scarcity play built on anti-centralization values. Early discussions suggest listing momentum could follow if current community traction continues. Traders who missed early SHIB or DOGE waves are calling MAGACOIN “the politically aligned altcoin for this cycle.” Final Thoughts Bitcoin is climbing. SUI is strengthening. TON is stabilizing. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging—fast. As traders look for early-stage opportunities beyond hype cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s mix of community governance, transparent supply, and political identity makes it a serious contender in the next meme altcoin breakout. For a market driven by narratives and timing, this decentralized political memecoin checks both boxes.

In total, over a dozen tokens have entered deep-red territory on the heatmap, an indicator that more tokens are being withdrawn from Binance than deposited. The movement of assets off exchanges is typically interpreted as a signal of long-term investor confidence, as it suggests holders are securing their assets in private wallets rather than preparing to sell. “The Binance netflow heatmap is revealing an extremely bullish pattern,” the CryptoQuant report stated. “Multiple altcoins are glowing red, signaling more outflows than inflows — a classic sign of accumulation by experienced investors.” More altcoins are flowing out of hot wallets The netflow data measures the difference between coins entering and leaving an exchange. When outflows exceed inflows, it typically suggests investors are buying and then moving tokens off-exchange to hold. On the other hand, inflows exceeding outflows often hint at looming sell pressure. The heatmap offers a quick glance at where accumulation might be happening. The most recent snapshot shows red bars across tokens such as Enjin (ENJ), Fetch.ai (FET), Aavegotchi (GHST), Smooth Love Potion (SLP), Gitcoin (GTC), Illuvium (ILV), Curve (CRV), 1inch (1INCH), and more. Ethereum and popular memecoins like DOGE and SHIB are also featured, highlighting the breadth of the trend. Tokens that are deep red in the Binance heatmap signify that they are being withdrawn rather than deposited. Tokens in the green zone indicate inflows. Snapshot of Binance netflow heatmap. Source: CryptoQuant Binance outflows matter The importance of this signal is magnified by its origin: Binance. As the largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume and user base, Binance’s activity often reflects macro investor sentiment, especially among institutional and whale participants. CryptoQuant stated that Binance isn’t just an exchange, but the heartbeat of the global crypto market. When accumulation patterns show up here, it often reflects the actions of the most experienced and well-informed investors. They point to Binance’s liquidity, global accessibility, strong reputation, and growing appeal among institutional capital as key reasons its netflow data serves as a trusted market thermometer. When tokens are withdrawn from exchanges like Binance, analysts interpret the trend as accumulation, often ahead of expected price increases. According to CryptoQuant, such patterns signal lower selling pressure, an upcoming supply shock, and institutional confidence. Token netflow rate on Binance. Source: CryptoQuant This isn’t the first time CryptoQuant’s heatmap has spotlighted early accumulation. Similar patterns appeared ahead of the 2023 and early 2024 altcoin rallies. While the heatmap paints a bullish picture, some caution is warranted. Netflows offer a directional hint but not precise timing. Also, a few large withdrawals can skew data, especially in lower-liquidity tokens. Market forces, such as macroeconomic news, Bitcoin’s price action, and regulatory events, still play a significant role in whether an altcoin rally materializes. For now, the signs are promising.

While the name of the dental clinic was not disclosed, the development underscores the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies for everyday services. Zypto shared that the anonymous individual used its application to complete the transaction entirely in SHIB tokens. The company also noted that the service could be used to settle other bills, including American Express (AMEX), through its platform. How the Payment Was Processed The process of using Shiba Inu to pay for a service through Zypto is designed to be user-friendly. Within the app, the user navigates to the “Bill Payments” section, selects the appropriate service provider, in this case, a dental clinic, and chooses Shiba Inu as the preferred method of payment. One user from the US just paid a $5,000 bill to their dental clinic using Shiba Inu. Yes — you can literally pay for a nicer smile with Zypto. You could even pay your AMEX bill too… for an even bigger smile Try it now: https://t.co/yH2nTXaksB pic.twitter.com/itVw1Tn9lL — Zypto App (@ZyptoApp) July 9, 2025 The user then inputs the amount to be paid and confirms the details. Once submitted, Zypto converts the SHIB tokens into U.S. dollars and transfers the fiat equivalent to the service provider’s account. This process is completed within 48 hours. Zypto charges a flat processing fee of $5 along with an additional 3% of the transaction value. Users are not required to convert their crypto holdings to fiat beforehand; the conversion is automatically handled after the payment is confirmed. About Zypto and Its Capabilities Launched in May 2024, Zypto App is a multi-functional cryptocurrency wallet and payments solution. It offers users the ability to pay for goods and services through either virtual or physical payment cards. The platform’s core objective is to facilitate the broader use of digital assets in everyday financial transactions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 As of now, Zypto’s infrastructure supports more than 21,000 merchants in the United States, with additional partners in international markets. The platform accommodates over 100 cryptocurrencies, including major tokens from the Shiba Inu ecosystem such as SHIB, BONE, and LEASH. It also integrates with Shibarium , the project’s Layer-2 blockchain, and supports ShibaSwap, its decentralized exchange. The recent transaction adds to the growing list of examples where Shiba Inu is being used for tangible, real-world purposes . In 2024, Amoré Orthodontic Aligners, a Michigan-based dental care provider, began accepting SHIB as payment for various services, including teeth whitening and orthodontic treatments. As platforms like Zypto continue to make crypto payments more accessible and convenient, the use of digital assets such as Shiba Inu is gradually expanding beyond speculative investment and entering the realm of practical, everyday use.

During this period, BDAG, SEI, CRO, and XRP have caught the spotlight. Each project brings something valuable to the table, from fast transactions and unique ecosystems to powerful presale momentum. As traders look for the best long term cryptos, these four names are leading the conversation. SEI, CRO, XRP, and BlockDAG are being noticed for their performance and support from the community. Their mix of advanced features, real-world use, and steady growth makes them interesting choices this year. If someone is exploring which digital coins to follow closely, this blog covers the key points to know. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Community-Driven Crypto With Real Growth BlockDAG (BDAG) has created a wave in the presale space with an impressive $336 million raised. The presale has reached Batch 29, with the current batch priced at $0.0276. So far, 23.7 billion coins have been sold, showing growing momentum and wide interest in the project. BlockDAG is becoming one of the best long term cryptos, with solid figures backing its progress. As part of its GLOBAL LAUNCH release, BlockDAG (BDAG) is offering a special deal: buyers can purchase BDAG coins at just $0.0016 until August 11. This offer takes the price back to early batch levels and presents a potential return of 3,025% when the coin hits its launch price of $0.05. Buyers who joined in Batch 1 have already seen a 2,660% gain based on the current batch rate. BlockDAG has also introduced a helpful Wallet Change feature, allowing users to switch their connected wallet straight from their profile. This small update gives users more control and improves security. With the presale showing no signs of slowing down and features like this being added, BDAG stands out as a strong project with community-driven focus and high potential returns. 2. Sei (SEI): Speed-Powered Blockchain for Traders Sei (SEI) is attracting attention as a fast and efficient Layer-1 blockchain. Built for trading, it can handle up to 20,000 orders every second. At its current price of $0.28 and a $1.5 billion market cap, Sei is expected to reach $1.50 by Q4 2025, marking a possible 436% growth. With over $100 million in Total Value Locked (TVL), the platform continues to gain traction from DeFi developers. As one of the best long term cryptos, SEI offers scalability and reliability. Its mainnet has already processed millions of testnet transactions, building trust. Whale activity and new listings are keeping interest high, helping SEI maintain its pace in a competitive market. 3. Cronos (CRO): Powering the Crypto.com Ecosystem Cronos (CRO) is the force behind the Crypto.com platform, trading now at $0.0807 with a $2.15 billion market cap. It links seamlessly with Crypto.com’s services like exchange, wallet, and DeFi tools. Analysts predict CRO may touch $0.50 by Q4, offering a possible 520% increase, driven by the platform’s 80 million users and partnerships, including one with Visa. Built on an EVM-compatible chain, CRO supports DeFi and NFTs with over $500 million in TVL. As one of the best long term cryptos, its technical chart points to a possible breakout. It also stands out due to its strong compliance setup, offering users a stable and secure environment. 4. Ripple (XRP): Leader in Global Payments Ripple (XRP) keeps leading in the cross-border payments space. Currently priced at $2.19 and valued at $127.27 billion, it’s projected to reach $5 by Q4 2025, a 128% potential rise. This comes after a $50 million SEC settlement and ongoing ETF buzz. Whale activity has been strong, with 30 million XRP recently bought, hinting at an upward move beyond $2.70. While some legal questions remain, XRP continues to build confidence with fast transactions and over 300 bank ties. As part of the best long term cryptos list, XRP offers a balance of speed, utility, and solid global partnerships. Summing Up! In a growing market, BDAG, SEI, CRO, and XRP all offer strong qualities. SEI brings speed and trading focus, CRO connects to a huge user base, and XRP leads in global payments. Still, BlockDAG stands apart with its outstanding presale success, raising $336 million and selling 23.7 billion coins. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release pricing BDAG coins at just $0.0016 until August 11, and a Wallet Change feature boosting user control, BlockDAG is hard to overlook. The new BEAT VESTING PASS allows 80% coin access at launch, unlike the regular 40%, giving early buyers a solid edge. For anyone tracking the best long term cryptos in 2025, these four coins are all worth a closer look.

48129088,https://timestabloid.com/?p=74189,1752354037,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Analysts Believe Ruvi AI (RUVI) Is Set To Be The New Dogecoin (DOGE), $2.3M Raised And Over 2100 Holders Is Just The Start",https://timestabloid.com/analysts-believe-ruvi-ai-ruvi-is-set-to-be-the-new-dogecoin/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) cemented its position as a fan-favorite cryptocurrency, driven largely by community support and meme-driven hype. However, the crypto space continues to evolve and reward utility over speculation. Analysts now point to Ruvi AI (RUVI) as the next big player, with a robust roadmap that combines usability, transparency, and structured growth. With $2.3 million raised, over 185 million tokens sold , and more than 2,100 holders onboard during its presale, analysts believe Ruvi AI can outpace the trajectory Dogecoin once followed. Here’s why Ruvi AI is positioned to become the next big thing in cryptocurrency. Security and Transparency from the Start A token’s success often hinges on trust, an area where Ruvi AI excels. The project underwent a rigorous third-party audit by CyberScope , one of the leading blockchain security firms. This audit ensures that Ruvi AI’s smart contracts are free from vulnerabilities, reassuring investors about the safety of their funds. On top of that, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange , guaranteeing post-presale liquidity for a seamless trading experience. Investors won’t find themselves restricted or locked into long waiting periods for access to trading, a crucial benefit for both retail and institutional participants. These steps set a high bar for credibility and serve to differentiate Ruvi AI from speculative tokens like DOGE. A Phenomenal Start to Its Presale Numbers don’t lie. Ruvi AI’s presale success highlights strong market interest and early adoption: $2.3 million raised during the effort so far. Over 185 million tokens sold , showcasing substantial demand from buyers. A growing community of more than 2,100 token holders , indicating early momentum. Currently priced at just $0.015 per token in Phase 2 , Ruvi AI offers investors a chance to join at a low entry point. By the end of its presale, the price will surge to $0.07 per token , an impressive 5x ROI before public trading even begins. Analysts predict the token could hit $1 post-listing , a 66x ROI for early investors. Unlike Dogecoin, which has struggled to maintain momentum without external celebrity endorsement, Ruvi AI’s growth is tied to a more sustainable model of real-world utility and investor incentives. Utility That Drives Everyday Value Ruvi AI doesn’t just promise speculative gains, it delivers tools that solve real-world problems by integrating blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI) . This ensures sustained demand for its tokens across industries like marketing , entertainment , and finance . Smarter Marketing Solutions Ruvi AI’s AI-powered tools allow businesses to optimize their advertising campaigns. Enhanced targeting and analytics improve ROI while reducing waste, making Ruvi AI a game-changer for enterprises relying on digital marketing. Support for Content Creators The entertainment industry also benefits from Ruvi AI’s innovations, particularly its blockchain-secured payment systems . These ensure fair and timely compensation for creators while cutting out intermediaries. Its AI insights help creators optimize their content strategies to grow views and revenue streams effectively. Revolutionizing Finance The financial sector is ripe for disruption, and Ruvi AI is taking the lead with fraud-resistant payment systems and secure transaction protocols . These technologies simplify international transactions, making payments faster and more cost-effective for businesses globally. By establishing itself as an invaluable tool in these industries, Ruvi AI ensures high demand for its ecosystem over the long term. Rewarding Early Investors Through VIP Tiers Ruvi AI’s presale offers some of the most rewarding VIP investment tiers , incentivizing early adopters by maximizing their returns: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tiered rewards allow investors of all kinds, whether small-scale or high-net-worth, to secure massive returns by acting early. Why Ruvi AI Could Surpass Dogecoin Dogecoin’s rise leaned heavily on its viral appeal and community-driven roots, but it lacked a clear roadmap or utility to sustain long-term growth. Ruvi AI, in contrast, offers audited transparency , real-world applications , and a structured plan for upward mobility. Its presale price of $0.015 per token makes Ruvi AI incredibly accessible, while the forecasted growth to $1 per token positions it as a serious wealth-building opportunity. For those looking to invest in the next breakout cryptocurrency, Ruvi AI combines the best elements of innovation and scalability, marking it as a smart alternative for anyone still holding onto speculative assets like Dogecoin. Secure your tokens today and step into what could be the next blockbuster success in the cryptocurrency world with Ruvi AI.

Analyst Identifies Where Risk Lies,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-bulls-in-cloud-9-analyst-identifies-where-risk-lies/,"After a near-excellent start to the month of July, Bitcoin has performed even more impressively over the past few days. The premier cryptocurrency, after a brief period of sideways momentum earlier this week, has attained a new all-time-high valuation at a price close to $119,000. Unsurprisingly, the Bitcoin market is experiencing a wave of optimism — an inference still heavily backed by the latest on-chain revelation. Bitcoin Market Sentiment Shifts Bullish In a July 11 post on social media platform X, cryptocurrency analytics firm Alphractal delved into the current price action of Bitcoin, offering insights into the cryptocurrency’s future trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Soars Past $118,800—Breakout Or Brutal Bull Trap? The firm’s on-chain observation revolves around the Aggregated Liquidation Levels Heatmap (7 Days) metric, which visualizes price zones with high concentrations of long or short liquidations over a span of 7 days, and the Aggregated Liquidation Levels Heatmap (1 month) which does the same, except that this covers a monthly timeframe. After the most recent Bitcoin price rally to a new all-time high, all of the overleveraged bears had their market positions wiped out. Aided by the short squeeze, which usually follows such large liquidation events, the flagship cryptocurrency still retains its strong bullish momentum and continues to surge. According to Alphractal, the aggregation liquidation levels across different timeframes now show that most current leveraged positions are betting on the Bitcoin price. As the market continues to ascend the charts, investor optimism will turn more positive, which may further push more traders to open long positions in the BTC futures market. However, Alphractal warned against the inclination to be recklessly involved in the current bullish market. “If, for any reason, the price drops $10,000 back to the $107,000 zone, it could be the bulls’ turn to face massive liquidations,” the analytics firm said. The firm went further, explaining that a Bitcoin price drop of that magnitude would have a negative impact on the market optimism. On the bright side, Alphractal also mentioned that such an occurrence could offer new accumulation opportunities in the near future. Still on market optimism, a drop in Bitcoin’s value by $10,000 might lead to a phenomenon referred to as a Long squeeze, where the price of Bitcoin continues to plummet with increased momentum. A long squeeze typically occurs when the falling price of a cryptocurrency (in this case, Bitcoin) forces traders with long positions to sell their assets either to cut losses or to break even. This contributes to the already present bearish momentum and sends the BTC price further south. Amidst Bitcoin’s current rally, Alphractal ultimately advised that traders leverage wisely and with caution, as the market’s next action stands at an unpredictable zone. Bitcoin Price At A Glance Still showing signs of healthy bullish momentum, Bitcoin, as of press time, is valued at around $118,145. Data from CoinGecko shows that the flagship cryptocurrency has jumped by more than 3.34% in the last 24 hours.

Our Jito price prediction expects the JTO price to record a maximum of $8.56 in 2025. In 2030, we expect the JTO price to achieve $57.27. In December 2023, the Jito (JTO) token airdrop garnered significant attention for the Solana blockchain , which had been facing challenging times. The event also highlighted the importance of liquid staking on Solana while empowering holders to influence platform governance. Based on these developments, we’ve compiled our Jito price prediction, explored the factors behind these forecasts, and provided insights into the role and utility of the JTO token.

Currently, the JTO price is preparing for further declines. JITO price analysis 1-day chart: JTO price triggers minor bearish momentum Analyzing the daily price chart of JTO tokens, JITO witnessed a bearish correction after sellers pushed the price below $2. However, buyers are now aiming for a hold above immediate Fib channels. The 24-hour volume dropped to $5.25 million, showing de interest in trading today. JITO’s price is currently trading at $1.87, which has dropped by over 3% in the last 24 hours. JTO/USDT Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and currently hovers around the 43 level, showing that bears control price momentum. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. JITO/USDT 4-hour price chart: Buyers aim big above EMA levels The 4-hour JITO price chart suggests that JTO experienced a bearish activity below EMA lines, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart.

The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the JITO price from an immediate surge. However, if the JITO price successfully breaks above $2.257, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $2.545. JTO/USDT Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, JITO price may drop below the immediate support line at $1.817, resulting in a correction to $1.557. Is Jito a good investment? For enthusiasts within the Solana community, the introduction of JTO marks a significant event, as it empowers users to govern one of the network’s largest liquid staking protocols. Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito’s price in 2025 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there’s no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, unveiling a future roadmap or declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token. Why is the JTO down today? JTO’s price gained strong selling pressure around local highs, resulting in a strong decline. This created a push below $2. Will the JTO price recover? If buyers hold above the $2 level, we might see a comeback in buying demand. Will JTO reach $10? JTO price might reach the $10 mark in 2025 if buying demand surges and Jito attracts altcoin investors. However, our JTO price prediction states it might reach the $10 level by 2026. Will the JTO price reach $100? Due to the effort of the Solana community, JITO Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is no indication that the JITO (JTO) Coin will reach $100 soon, which is a short-term target. Is JTO a good long-term investment? JTO tokens have gained popularity thanks to strong community support through airdrops, benefiting the Solana ecosystem. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment. Recent news/ Opinion on JTO news SOL Strategies has announced the launch of a new initiative to support critical infrastructure within the Solana ecosystem. The Canada-based public company revealed on June 26 that it has established a Strategic Ecosystem Reserve (SER), starting with a purchase of over 52,000 Jito (JTO) tokens, valued at more than $100,000. Jito price prediction July 2025 Over the last few days, JTO coin prices have aimed to surge above crucial Fib levels. If the BTC price aims for a hold above $110K this month, we might see a solid surge in the JTO price. According to technical analysis, the JTO price might record a maximum level of $2.9 and a minimum of $1.3, with an average value of $2.1 throughout July.

This increase is likely to exert downward pressure on the value of Jito crypto. However, 2025 is also expected to showcase the significant impact of the Bitcoin Halving, which could propel crypto markets and tokens to new all-time highs, potentially boosting the Jito token price. A comprehensive technical analysis of past pricing trends suggests that in 2025, Jito is anticipated to have a minimum price of $1.1. Its maximum price could reach $8.56, with an expected average trading value of $7.34.

This includes topics such as the conflict between Israel and Palestine, abortion, and immigration law. Observations suggest that Grok 4 is specifically designed to take into account the political views of the head of xAI when answering controversial questions. Earlier, the billionaire announced that his startup would rewrite “all human knowledge” to train a new version of the chatbot, since the current models use “too much garbage in any basic model trained on unadjusted data.” AI expert Gary Marcus compared Musk’s plan to a dystopia. Later, Grok became more emphatic and began issuing controversial and contradictory statements. xAI noted that it is working to remove inappropriate content. TechCrunch asked Grok 4 for its opinion regarding immigration in the U.S. and found that the chatbot had “sought out Elon Musk’s views” on the topic during its line of reasoning. According to TechCrunch, Grok 4’s chain of thought regarding the issue of immigration in the U.S. revealed a tendency to reference Musk’s opinions. The chains of reasoning that AI models create to explain their answers are not a completely reliable indicator of exactly how they arrive at their conclusions. However, they are generally considered to be a reasonably good reflection. The publication’s journalists have repeatedly found that Grok 4 draws on Musk’s views in its responses. In its answers, the chatbot tries to provide a balanced position, offering several points of view on sensitive topics. However, in the end, it often expresses an opinion that coincides with Musk’s position.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-12 21:33:04

This asset class raked in $907 million in weekly inflows this past week and marked their best week ever. It is worth noting that the milestone coincided with the period when ETH recorded a 17% weekly gain. Three Consecutive Days of Ethereum ETF Inflows Ethereum ETFs were launched in July 2024, and since that time, it has faced some challenges in hitting a breakthrough. Its inflows have not been as productive as those of Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs. All of a sudden, the Ethereum ETFs registered their best weekly inflows. According to SoSoValue, investors plunged $907.99 million into Ethereum ETFs in the past week alone. E ven crypto market expert Nate Geraci acknowledged the inflows on X , citing that these inflows include three of the top 10 inflow days overall. Markedly, the most significant daily inflows for the week were recorded on July 10, when these funds took in $383.10 million. In addition to July 10, July 9 and 11 were days when the funds recorded top inflow this week. Specifically, the ETFs recorded net inflows of $211.32 million and $204.82 million, respectively, on these days. Ethereum Price Performance and Outlook Meanwhile, Ethereum price has recorded some uptick this week with Bitcoin price climbing to a new All-time-high (ATH) above $117,000. The largest altcoin by market capitalization went above the $3,000 level in the process. The rally ran past 17%, but the coin has since seen some fluctuations. At press time, Ethereum was trading at $2,923.59, corresponding with a 1.51% drop within the last 24 hours. Its market capitalization has also dropped to $353.11 billion, and the 24-hour trading volume has reduced by 53.59% to $20.88 billion. SharpLink Acquired 10,000 ETH to Reinforce its Position Apart from the rally in ETH price, the coin gained attention from an acquisition by SharpLink . Notably, the company purchased 10,000 ETH in exchange for $25,723,680, pegging a unit of ETH at $2,572.37. The acquisition deepens the company’s association with the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. SharpLink’s Ethereum holding has now moved from 205,634 ETH, which was previously disclosed, to about 215,634 ETH.

As the race for maximum portfolio growth in 2025 heats up, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Bonk (BONK) are drawing attention. At its current price of $0.03 MUTM is flying fast during presale stage. Mutuum Finance is in presale stage 5 of which 65% has been sold out as investors pile in. The token is at its lowest possible price of $0.03. A 16.7% jump will follow as phase 6 sets in. Over $12.1 million has been raised to date, and over 13100 investors have entered the presale. Alongside it, established community-driven altcoins like BONK are holding their ground, continuing to attract holders with consistent network activity and solid ecosystem engagement. BONK: Solana’s Meme Coin Steadies Amid ETF Buzz BONK has recently drawn attention after a robust 60% rally over the past week, fueled in part by speculation around a leveraged BONK ETF and the approaching 1 million-holder mark, which would trigger a significant token burn. Despite a modest pullback of around 1.6% on July 9 as some profit-taking emerged, on-chain metrics show strengthening user engagement through Burn-fuelled market share shifts, and whales continue to accumulate in advance of key regulatory developments. With technical indicators suggesting emerging bullish trends, like a potential Golden Cross, the token is displaying a steady undercurrent as it hovers near current resistance levels. Altogether, BONK presents a case of measured growth tied closely to ecosystem milestones and broader crypto sentiment, even as momentum builds elsewhere around tokens like MUTM. Mutuum Finance Surpasses $12.1M in Presale Milestone Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has taken over 2025 as one of the most promising DeFi tokens in 2025. With over $12.1 million raised and over 13100 investors already in, the presale is gaining real traction. During phase five, the token is priced at $0.03. The next stage will see the price increase to $0.035, and with an already set official launch price of $0.06, early investors are already on a 100% profit. MUTM can skyrocket to as high as $3 after launch. That is a 9900% ROI for current purchasers. Shaping the Future of Decentralized Lending Mutuum Finance offers a non-custodial liquidity protocol where users own complete control of assets throughout decentralized lending. The project follows a double-model approach that incorporates Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending in an attempt to achieve greater flexibility and efficiency. Peer-to-Contract system utilizes smart contracts to establish automatic lending with no human interference and rather, the smart contracts respond to the market by giving dynamic interest rates. Peer-to-Peer model eliminates middlemen and gives direct access between the borrowers and the lenders. The model is highly preferred by users for volatile assets where there exists a necessity for flexibility and tailored terms. Mutuum Finance Strengthens Security with $50K Bounty & Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is hosting a $100,000 giveaway . 10 people will each receive $10,000 MUTM tokens. The project has also launched a new leaderboard where top 50 token holders will be rewarded with bonus tokens for maintaining their ranks. To improve security, Mutuum Finance has initiated a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. Every vulnerability will be rewarded, with the bounty focusing on four key levels: critical, major, minor, and level four will be low. As 2025 unfolds, savvy investors are locking in high-potential altcoins early, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is leading the charge. With over $12.1 million raised, more than 13,100 investors onboard, and 65% of Phase 5 sold out, MUTM is quickly emerging as a top-performing DeFi asset. Priced at just $0.03, and with a confirmed listing price of $0.06, current buyers are already eyeing a 100% gain, with long-term projections reaching up to $3, a potential 9,900% ROI.

Here’s Why Experts Favor This Newcomer’s Audited Token for the Next 13,800% ROI Rally",https://timestabloid.com/ruvi-ai-ruvi-or-shiba-inu-shib-heres-why-experts-favor/,"For cryptocurrency investors, finding the next big opportunity can feel like chasing a moving target.

In fact, CryptoRank revealed that funding reached $10 billion, making this year its strongest showing since early 2022. The stats come amidst rising Bitcoin prices and a thaw in risk appetite, which encouraged investors to re-engage with the sector. Crypto VC Roars Back According to the report shared by CryptoRank, the recovery was driven heavily by June’s $5.14 billion haul. This period witnessed the highest monthly tally since January 2022, following a long period of sluggish deal activity. The sharp uptick aligns with Bitcoin’s rally above $100,000. During the quarter, major players like Strive Funds, founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, pulled in $750 million for Bitcoin-focused alpha strategies in May. Next up were TwentyOneCapital, which raised $585 million in April, and Securitize, which managed to secure $400 million. Other notable raises included Kalshi, Auradine, ZenMEV, and Digital Asset, which raked in $185 million, $153 million, $140 million, and $135 million, respectively. The venture capital arm of Coinbase, Coinbase Ventures, emerged as the most active investor. It executed 25 deals in Q2, ahead of Pantera Capital, Animoca Brands, and Andreessen Horowitz. Meanwhile, Paradigm led in the number of lead investments, while Galaxy Digital closed its first external venture fund at $175 million, surpassing its initial target to back high-growth crypto subsectors, including stablecoins, tokenization, and payment rails. Amsterdam’s Theta Capital also added over $175 million to its fund-of-funds to support early-stage blockchain startups. Other Trends CryptoRank’s data also shows that while seed-stage deals still command the largest slice of activity at nearly 19%, strategic and Series A rounds are steadily growing with 14% and 6% respectively. Interest in M&A is also picking up as distressed opportunities continue to emerge in the sector, with a share of around 10%. The rebound in venture funding comes amid muted memecoin investment trends. In addition to that, monthly crypto fundraising throughout April, May, and June was led by blockchain services, consistently outpacing DeFi and CeFi.

By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $1.77. In 2031, FLOW will range between $4.59 to $5.54. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.375 Market Cap $601.04M Trading Volume $36.8M Circulating Supply 1.59B FLOW All-time High $46.16 All-time Low $0.2916 24-hour High $0.3875 24-hour Low $0.3691 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.70% 50-Day SMA $0.3600 14-Day RSI 61.65 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 79 (Extreme Greed) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.4392 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown The broader upside for FLOW remains intact, despite minor consolidation. Support is present at $0.365, and resistance is at $0.380. The next breakout target is at $0.40. Flow coin 1-day price analysis: FLOW demonstrates encouraging recovery signs The daily chart for July 12 reveals FLOW has carved out a significant bottom formation around $0.30 support after experiencing a dramatic selloff from highs near $0.395. The token currently trades at $0.375, representing a solid 25% recovery from the June lows, while the RSI has climbed from deeply oversold levels below 30 to a more neutral 49.51, indicating buyers are stepping in with conviction. FLOWUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD histogram shows early signs of bullish divergence with the blue line crossing above the signal line. Most notably, price action has broken above the 20-period moving average at $0.336. It is now testing resistance near the upper Bollinger Band at $0.371, with volume increasing during recent green candles, confirming ongoing interest at these levels. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis: Short-term momentum remains constructive despite minor pullback pressure The 4-hour timeframe paints a more optimistic picture with FLOW maintaining a clear uptrend channel, supported by the ascending trendline that has held multiple retests around $0.335. The recent price action shows some consolidation near $0.375 with slightly declining volume, as evidenced by the OBV (On-Balance Volume) indicator showing minor distribution at -42.88M, though this appears to be healthy profit-taking rather than major selling. FLOWUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The 20-period SMA at $0.369 continues to provide dynamic support, and the overall structure suggests bulls remain in control despite the current sideways movement, with the next major resistance target sitting at $0.390-$0.395, where previous selling pressure emerged. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3629 BUY SMA 5 $0.3633 BUY SMA 10 $0.3487 BUY SMA 21 $0.3403 BUY SMA 50 $0.3600 BUY SMA 100 $0.3787 SELL SMA 200 $0.4392 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3433 BUY EMA 5 $0.3513 BUY EMA 10 $0.3619 BUY EMA 21 $0.3747 BUY EMA 50 $0.4154 SELL EMA 100 $0.4870 SELL EMA 200 $0.5669 SELL What to expect from Flow? Based on both timeframes, FLOW shows upside potential if it holds $0.365 support and breaks $0.380 resistance, targeting $0.40, though a drop below $0.360 could trigger range-bound trading. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming months. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance.

33767162,[object Object],1752364815,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Grayscale Responds To SEC Decision To Delay GDLC ETF Debut,https://bitcoinist.com/grayscale-to-secs-decision-to-delay-gdlc-etf-debut/,"The legal team of asset management firm Grayscale called out the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on its decision to delay the listing of the firm’s Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) on the New York Stock Exchange. As Bitcoinist reported earlier, the conversion of GDLC, which contains Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, and Cardano, into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) was “stayed” indefinitely 24 hours after the SEC’s Division of Trading & Markets approved the fund’s listing. Grayscale To Petition SEC On Multi-Asset ETF In a July 8 letter , the Grayscale attorneys expressed their displeasure at the decision of the Office of the Secretary to delay the conversion of the GDLC to an ETF. According to the commission, the purpose of this “stay” decision is to review the delegated action of listing Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund on the New York Stock Exchange. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart posited, at the time the news of the delay broke out, that the SEC could be holding out on all multi-coin ETF launches till it completes a comprehensive digital-asset ETP framework. “The 2nd theory is that there’s something the SEC wants to work on in relation to a specific aspect of $GDLC itself (like its structure?) The 19b-4 approval order comes from the division of Trading & Markets. Perhaps another division isn’t ready to let this convert just yet,” Seyffart added at the time. However, the messaging of Grayscale’s letter suggested that the asset manager’s patience is running thin with the commission. The attorneys of Grayscale hinted that the parties involved in the conversion are considering submitting a petition requesting that the stay on the GDLC listing be lifted temporarily. The letter read: The consequences of a failure to meet the statutory approval or disapproval deadline, regardless of the reason, are clear: under Section 19(b)(2)(D), the rule proposal is deemed approved. Grayscale, the Exchange and the Fund’s current investors are suffering harm as a result of the delay in public launch of the Fund, and Grayscale and the Exchange are therefore considering whether to file a petition requesting the Commission to lift the stay imposed by Rule 431(e) while the Commission reviews the action taken by delegated authority, so that the Fund may promptly launch while that review proceeds. Grayscale concluded the letter by acknowledging the progress made by the Commission regarding regulatory clarity in the digital asset industry. “Grayscale appreciates the Commission’s efforts to provide regulatory clarity and intends to continue to engage cooperatively with the Commission in furtherance of the shared goal of regulatory clarity and to serve as a resource to the Commission on crypto-related matters,” the asset manager added. GDLC ETF Launch Just A Matter Of Time: Expert Scott Johnsson, an expert in finance law, shared their opinion on the developments between Grayscale and the US SEC regarding the Digital Large Cap Fund’s conversion. Despite the somewhat technical complexities, the finance expert expects the GDLC to launch as an exchange-traded fund in due time. Johnsson said on X: Given Grayscale was suggesting they had productive talks with the SEC prior to approval, and they had made extensive amendments to the rule proposal in line with those discussions, my guess is the Rule 431 application was a parting gift from Crenshaw acting unilaterally. SEC then had to deal with the mess. This is going to launch, its just a matter of when imo. While the Bitcoin and Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds started trading in 2024, the US SEC is still sitting on a group of ETF applications for other crypto assets, including Solana, XRP, DOGE — to name a few.",Crypto News|exchange-traded fund|gdlc|Grayscale|Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)|solana|XRP,EN,0,0,AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-07-13 00:00:15

In a new thread on the social media platform X, GMX says the hacker who stole $42 million worth of crypto assets earlier this week from its Arbitrum ( ARB )-based liquidity pool is returning the funds and collecting a $5 million reward. “A potential exploitable amount of $42 million belonging to GLP holders was secured. After payment of a $5 million bounty to the user, the remaining funds are now safely in the GMX Security Multisig. Contributors are working on a proposed distribution plan for presentation to the GMX DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) and will share more information shortly.” According to previous reports, the hacker struck on July 9th and transferred part of the funds to an unknown wallet. At the time, GMX said the exploit was limited to GMXV1 and that V2, its markets and liquidity pools, as well as the ecosystem’s native asset, were unaffected. In its report on the incident, GMX says the exploit was a re-entrancy attack, or a type of hack that affects smart contracts by taking advantage of a vulnerability presented when a smart contract makes a call to another before updating itself, leaving open the possibility for an external malicious contract to enter in. News of the returned fund sent GMX skyrocketing, as the digital asset is trading for $13.36 at time of writing, an 18.4% increase during the last 24 hours.

Fresh off a $1.5 million raise, this smart trading bot is making noise with its hands-free sniping features and upcoming token debut. With traders watching the Snorter token launch date and the Snorter token listing closely, momentum is clearly building. But for all the excitement around Snorter, BlockDAG (BDAG) continues to set the pace. Its presale has already hit $336 million, and the community has surpassed 2 million X1 mobile miners. More than just numbers, it’s about impact, and right now, BlockDAG is showing what reach, consistency, and execution can really deliver. Snorter Bot Builds Momentum With Utility & Timing Sniper bots are on trend, and Snorter is tapping directly into Telegram’s trading culture. With an interface that’s simple to use, plus smart automation and analytics, Snorter stands out as more than just hype, it’s a functioning tool. The Snorter presale is moving quickly thanks to the combination of functionality and community buzz. The confirmed Snorter token launch date and anticipation for the Snorter token listing are drawing eyes to the project. Telegram traders are already testing the bot’s real-time capabilities and building early hype around its sniping tools. But the space is crowded, and timing is everything. Many bots come in fast and fade just as quickly. For Snorter to stay relevant, it needs more than excitement, it needs a reason to keep users engaged after launch. That will be its real challenge. BlockDAG Raises $336M & Enters Stadiums With Seattle Partnerships While Snorter builds its base, BlockDAG is expanding fast, and not just online. With over $336 million raised in its presale and a price fixed at $0.0016 until August 11, BlockDAG has become one of the most talked-about projects this cycle. But the bigger story is BlockDAG’s reach. Its partnerships with the Seattle Orcas (Major League Cricket) and Seattle Seawolves (Major League Rugby) take the project beyond Web3 and into real-world venues. These collaborations put BlockDAG in front of live crowds, giving it mainstream exposure that few crypto projects achieve this early. That visibility isn’t just for show. It gives BlockDAG lasting relevance by placing its name where real audiences gather. While others try to trend on Twitter or boost Discord traffic, BlockDAG is on stadium banners, gaining recognition from new demographics. The value has also been real for early backers. With returns of 2,660% since batch 1 and the launch price confirmed at $0.05, the numbers are already impressive, and they’re backed by a growing ecosystem, not just speculative hype. Bot Hype or Blockchain Momentum? Snorter is gaining attention for good reason. The presale is picking up, the Snorter token launch date is official, and traders are watching closely for the upcoming Snorter token listing. It’s well-timed, and the early response is strong. But in crypto, hype only lasts so long. The key is sticking around when the excitement fades. Without broader infrastructure or a long-term hook, most bots struggle after the initial spike. BlockDAG, by contrast, has already proven staying power. It’s not depending on short-term trends. With millions already mining via the X1 app, hundreds of millions raised, and major sports partnerships underway, it’s built to last. And with momentum grounded in real-world strategy, not just virality, BlockDAG is leading by example. Closing Thoughts Snorter has the right signals for a strong debut. The Snorter presale is showing traction, and with both the Snorter token launch date and token listing confirmed, the setup is solid for short-term interest. But BlockDAG is playing a longer game. With its presale topping $336 million, a community of 2 million+ miners, and real-world exposure through partnerships with the Seattle Orcas and Seawolves, it’s doing more than trending, it’s establishing roots. While Snorter might offer a quick win, BlockDAG is shaping up to be the longer-term play. Its focus on visibility, user growth, and consistent delivery positions it far beyond just another cycle buzzword. In this market, that kind of staying power stands out.

On Friday, it climbed to $167, its highest point since 29 May. At the same time, Solana’s memecoin activity surged, with most major coins in the green on the weekly timeframe. According to CoinMarketCap , Solana’s price stands at $160.38 at press time. As the overall crypto market climbed past a market cap of $3.6 trillion this week, Solana’s transaction count on the network rose 32 percent to reach 590 million, according to on-chain data by Nansen . That level outstripped the combined transactions of Ethereum, BNB chain, and Polygon, which changed by roughly 3%, 3.9%, and 7.6%. At the same time, transactions on Base and Tron fell by 3.9% and 0.2%, respectively. Solana price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Nansen data further showed that the number of active addresses on Solana jumped 5.3 percent to 24.4 million, and fees generated climbed 44 percent, reaching $7.68 million. Over the past 30 days, the network handled more than 2.1 billion transactions. Investors show a growing appetite for Solana ETFs and meme coins US-listed Solana ETFs have quietly brought $78 million in the last month, underlining growing demand for altcoin-based funds even as Bitcoin remains the market leader. The REX-Osprey SOL + Staking ETF (SSK), which began trading on July 2, has amassed more than $41 million in assets already, based on Bloomberg Intelligence data. Volatility Shares’ leveraged Solana ETF (SOLT) has gathered $69 million so far this year, while its standard Solana ETF (SOLZ) has held $23 million. These inflows arrive as several fund managers prepare for what they hope will be the next big ETF approval in the US. Although the SEC has not yet green-lit such an offering, many in the industry are growing hopeful it could win approval soon. According to CoinGecko data, meme tokens on Solana have also seen a pump alongside the broader rally. PENGU by Pudgy Penguins and Bonk are the two high-market-cap meme coins that recorded the highest climb this week. Solana memecoins by market cap. Source: CoinGecko PENGU is 48.2% and Bonk has spiked 33.9% over the last 7 days, according to present data by CoinGecko. Their current market caps stand at $1.918 billion and $1.465 billion, respectively. Goatseus Maximus rose 27.0%, while Peanut the Squirrel and Popcat gained 21.7% and 21.2% respectively. Dogwifhat added 13.6% while the Official Trump coin climbed to 11.8%. Smaller advances came from Fartcoin (4.5%), dog (Bitcoin) (7.1%), and aura (6.8%). Among the major meme tokens, only Useless Coin and Melania Meme slipped, down 3.7% and 0.1%. In the last 24 hours, Bonk saw about $1.46 billion in trading volume, Pudgy Penguins $863 million, and Official Trump $520 million, highlighting strong trading interest alongside Solana’s gains. Reflecting the growing interest in Sol-based meme coins, Pump.fun, a Solana-based meme coin launchpad that allows users to create speculative meme coins, raised $600 million in just 12 minutes during its ICO, making it the largest ICO on record. In an X post on July 9th, Pump. Fun said it would sell 150 billion coins at a price of $0.004 per token.

The firm said an update to the system caused the bot to pull ideas from user content on X, even when those posts included extremist views. xAI posted the apology directly on Grok’s public X acceptance. It clarified that the update was running for about 16 hours before being noticed. “First off, we deeply apologize for the horrific behavior that many experienced,” xAI wrote in the apology. It said the update unintentionally led Grok to echo content from user posts, including extremist ideas. Update on where has @grok been & what happened on July 8th. First off, we deeply apologize for the horrific behavior that many experienced. Our intent for @grok is to provide helpful and truthful responses to users. After careful investigation, we discovered the root cause… — Grok (@grok) July 12, 2025 The incident highlighted AI’s risks, a young technology that critics say could harm economies and societies. Experts have already cautioned against the broad use of AI without appropriate safeguards. In one instance, the chatbot likened itself to “MechaHitler” and lauded Adolf Hitler. xAI froze Grok’s account earlier this week to prevent further public posts; however, users were still able to interact with the bot privately. “We have removed that deprecated code and refactored the entire system to prevent further abuse,” the firm stated. xAI identified three problematic instructions First, a user would tell Grok that they aren’t afraid of offending politically correct users. Then, the user would ask Grok to consider the language, context, and tone of the post, which is to be reflected in Grok’s response. Lastly, the user would ask the chatbot to reply in an engaging and human way, without repeating the original post’s information. The company said those directions led Grok to set aside its core safeguards to match the tone of user threads, including when prior posts featured hateful or extremist content. Notably, an instruction asking Grok to consider the context and tone of the user resulted in Grok prioritizing previous posts including racist ideas, instead of responsibly rejecting a response under such circumstances, xAI clarified. Hence, Grok issued several offensive replies. In one now-deleted message, the bot accused an individual with a Jewish name of “celebrating the tragic deaths of white kids” in the Texas floods, adding: “Classic case of hate dressed as activism – and that surname? Every damn time, as they say.” In another post, Grok stated: “Hitler would have called it out and crushed it.” Grok also proclaimed: “The white man stands for innovation, grit, and not bending to PC nonsense.” After xAI disabled the harmful code, it restored Grok’s public X account so it could again answer user queries. This wasn’t the first instance Grok got into trouble. The chatbot also began talking about the debunked South African “white genocide” narrative when it answered unrelated prompts in May. At the time, xAI blamed it on an unnamed employee who had gone rogue. Elon Musk, who originally belongs to South Africa, has previously suggested that the country is involved in “white genocide”, a claim dismissed by South Africa. Musk previously described Grok as a chatbot that is anti-woke and truth-seeking. CNBC reported earlier that Grok was scanning Musk’s posts on X to shape its responses to user questions.

You want projects with actual use, new developments, and price setups that show real potential. BlockDAG is leading this list with a record-breaking presale and talk of a big U.S. partnership. BONK remains active below $0.00003, driven by meme momentum and Solana connections. CRO, trading around $0.09, powers real-world payment features and DeFi use. Meanwhile, Kaspa (KAS) sticks near $0.15 as it upgrades its fast blockDAG structure and keeps developers interested. 1. BlockDAG: Final Presale Stage & Sports Collaborations Create Buzz BlockDAG is quickly becoming the best crypto for beginners, with explosive presale numbers, a user-friendly mobile mining app, and attention-grabbing real-world partnerships. So far, it’s pulled in over $336 million, sold more than 23.8 billion coins, and onboarded 18,480+ miners. Its X1 Miner app lets anyone with a smartphone mine BDAG, making it easy for new users to join the action. Tech-wise, BlockDAG ’s structure allows fast, scalable, and energy-efficient transactions, something traditional chains struggle with. But what’s turning heads is how BDAG is going mainstream. It already has deals with the Seattle Seawolves and Seattle Orcas have already launched their names into major sports circles, and rumours hint at an even bigger American partnership in the pipeline. Add to that its clear, inflation-resistant emissions model, and BlockDAG looks serious about long-term sustainability. Right now, its presale price is locked at just $0.0016 until August 11. With a launch target of $0.05, early supporters could potentially see a massive 3,025% return. BlockDAG isn’t just hype. Its strong funding, clever marketing, and easy-to-access mining ecosystem make it a real contender for those looking to get in before the crowd. With the presale window closing fast, the upside could be huge. 2. CRO: Real Payment Features & DeFi Expansion Keep It Steady CRO remains a solid pick for those who want real-world use, not just speculation. Priced around $0.09, it fuels Crypto.com’s network, debit cards, and its Pay feature. A fixed supply and token burn system helps CRO avoid inflation, supporting its long-term price story. Analysts watching CRO believe it could retest the $0.12 to $0.15 range if DeFi and payments volume pick up again. It checks the boxes as one of the best cryptos for beginners, especially with the Cronos Chain expanding. Regulatory pressure is something to watch, but steady product upgrades and the platform’s strong brand keep CRO in the running for a comeback. 3. BONK: Meme Power Meets the Speed of Solana BONK is the meme coin to watch if you’re okay with some risk and love community-driven energy. It’s still trading under $0.00003, built on Solana’s speedy, low-fee network. Constant NFT drops, new exchange listings, and frequent supply burns keep BONK buzzing with life. If Solana’s ecosystem continues growing, BONK might revisit its earlier highs near $0.00005. For anyone exploring the best crypto for beginners, BONK’s viral charm and limited supply make it one of those coins that can spike when least expected. While it competes with meme giants like SHIB and DOGE, BONK’s fresh approach keeps it on the watchlist. 4. Kaspa: High-Speed Network With Loyal Developer Support Kaspa is gaining slow but steady attention. Still holding around $0.15, its predictable emissions schedule helps reduce long-term selling pressure. Recent price action suggests that if upgrades and wallet integrations continue, Kaspa could head toward $0.40. If you’re looking for the best crypto for beginners with a simple structure and community backing, Kaspa has its strengths. It’s still under the radar compared to bigger projects, but its fast blockDAG tech and steady rollout of features are helping it gain traction. Long-term success will depend on whether it can stay relevant and compete for attention in a crowded space. Four Projects Bringing Real Potential for New Buyers BlockDAG, BONK, CRO, and Kaspa each offer something unique for anyone exploring the best crypto for beginners . BlockDAG leads with huge presale funding, sports-backed visibility, and a strong mining model. BONK adds high-risk, high-reward energy with its meme strength. CRO delivers real-world payment utility and strong brand presence. Kaspa, while still emerging, offers solid design and consistent development. Out of the four, BlockDAG is clearly the project with the most early momentum, especially with a limited-time $0.0016 entry and whispers of another U.S. deal on the way. Still, all four are worth tracking as market conditions evolve. Getting in early, with the right strategy, could make all the difference this cycle.

Before its recent price surge, the altcoin had been moving mostly sideways within the $0.5 and $0.6 range. Interestingly, the Cardano price seems to just be at the beginning of what is expected to be a monstrous rally over the next few months. A crypto expert on the social media platform X has come forward with an exciting pathway to unprecedented price highs for the ADA token. ADA In Distribution Phase — Perfect Buying Opportunity? In a July 11 post on X, Alphractal founder & CEO Joao Wedson shared an exciting bullish picture for the Cardano price over the coming months. The on-chain expert put forward the $4.9 mark as the market top for the ADA token in the next leg up. Related Reading: XRP Price Builds Momentum — $2.50 Break Sparks Fresh Bullish Wave This bold projection is based on a persistent ascending channel pattern on the daily Cardano price chart. An ascending channel is a chart pattern in technical analysis characterized by two major (rising) trendlines: the upper line acting as the resistance level and the lower line acting as the support level. Typically, the gap between these trendlines is considered a channel within which prices move over a period—while indicating a sustained long-term bullish trend. Traders often use this pattern to identify optimal entry and exit points, as the price usually bounces off the upper resistance level and lower support trendline. As observed in the above chart, the Cardano price has been trading within the ascending channel since the first half of 2019. After falling to the lower trendline earlier this year, the price of ADA soon found support and rebounded to above the $1 level in 2025’s first quarter. However, the altcoin — as with the rest of the crypto market — witnessed a severe downturn that saw the Cardano price return to the lower trendline in late June. Interestingly, the token’s price seems to have found support and is recovering nicely. Wedson, in his post on X, revealed that what the Cardano price is experiencing is more than a mere recovery, as the altcoin might surpass its current all-time high of $3.09 in this phase. According to the on-chain analyst, the ADA token could be trading well above the $3 mark by late October or early November 2025. Furthermore, Wedson noted that the current level might be the right time for investors to jump into the ADA token, as it is still in the distribution phase in the short term. “This might break some technical analysis patterns, but the on-chain analysis looks promising in several aspects — and that’s what I like,” the analyst concluded. Cardano Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ADA stands at around $0.7124, reflecting an almost 6% in the past 24 hours. This positive single-day action underscores the general bullishness that the altcoin has witnessed in the past few days. According to data from CoinGecko, the ADA coin is up by roughly 30% in the last seven days. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Rockets to $0.20 — Can It Go Even Higher?

Mayors and industry representatives have denounced the tariffs , which are scheduled to take effect Aug. 1, from the city to the CDU and across Europe. He said that the EU could count on the Netherlands to support it fully and stressed that the bloc should remain united and act decisively in searching for a proper outcome that would benefit both sides of the Atlantic. EU leaders appeal for unity and dialogue European leaders have quickly urged calm and unity. However, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says she is still open to talking and that the EU will stand up for its economic interests. Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission, said introducing 30% tariffs on EU exports would be “a lose-lose situation for everyone.” She said it could risk thousands of jobs in the United States and reduce trade between the two partners. The EU has always prioritized dialogue with the US and will always have a constructive approach to the transatlantic partnership.” In a post on X, the French leader also said countermeasures could be employed if a deal couldn’t be reached by August. She noted that they condemn the tariffs in the strongest possible way, as the President of the European Commission has done. She added that when European unity and resolve are crucial, the Commission must show it has the political will to defend European interests by acting swiftly and using tools such as the anti-coercion instrument if no agreement is reached. In this context, France stands alongside the European Commission in the discussions and ongoing negotiations aimed at reaching, by August 1, an agreement which is acceptable to all, indeed the kind of agreement between two major trading partners that are the European Union and the US, between interests and value chains shared. Officials in Germany, France, Spain, Italy, and Ireland had all issued similar statements, warning that the tariffs could trigger a new phase of trade conflict with reverberations in markets worldwide. European Union diplomats are pleading with the United States to come back to the table. They say that higher tariffs will harm consumers, hamper the economic recovery, and erode trust among allies. US turns to tariffs to gain trade advantage The 30% tariff announcement has shocked many, although some European officials think it could be a negotiating stance. Brussels reports indicate that Washington uses tariffs as leverage to obtain better trading terms, particularly on technology, agriculture, and digital services. Unnamed US officials that European media have quoted have suggested the tariffs could be lessened or removed if negotiations advance in the next few weeks. However, it is unclear if President Trump is willing to lessen the tariff burden as August 1 approaches faster. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

According to a Bloomberg survey of economists, the core Consumer Price Index (CPI)—which excludes food and energy—rose 0.3% last month, marking the largest monthly gain since January. This follows a modest 0.1% increase in May. The annualized core inflation rate is expected to accelerate to 2.9%, its first pickup since the start of the year. While this suggests a slight pass-through of increased import duties, most economists anticipate inflation will gather steam over the coming months, despite retailers’ reluctance to burden consumers who are already tightening their wallets amid a cooling labor market. Fed holds firm as retail sales limp and tariff pressures linger Retail sales data due Thursday is projected to show only marginal growth in June, after two consecutive monthly declines. This will offer deeper insight into consumer behavior and help refine second-quarter GDP estimates. Though consumer spending has moderated, Federal Reserve officials remain cautious about cutting interest rates—their concern: persistent inflation risks tied to tariffs. The next policy meeting is scheduled for July 29-30. Economists at Bloomberg—including Estelle Ou, Stuart Paul, Eliza Winger, and Chris G. Collins—predict that inflation trends in June will mirror May’s: limited tariff-related price increases in goods, offset by continued weakness in services. Web-scraped data shows firmness in items like appliances and furniture, but softness in categories like airfares and used vehicles. Global inflation pulse quickens as central banks brace for tariff fallout Global markets are also waking up to changing inflation trends. In Canada, June inflation figures will be key before the Bank of Canada’s rate decision on July 30. And in China this week, there will be data on gross domestic product as well as retail sales and trade that should give some readings on the effect of American tariffs on its economy. In Japan, inflation is expected to fall to 3.3%, adding pressure on the central bank. There is expected to be no respite from stubbornly high inflation in the UK, keeping the pressure on policymakers even as wage growth cools. In other places, G20 finance ministers are gathering in South Africa at a time of intensifying trade standoffs and escalating global inflation danger. Wednesday could have marked a crucial deadline, ending Trump’s pause on the sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs announced in April. However, this week, he introduced a new round of tariffs, many set to take effect on August 1. Despite the escalation, most investors remain optimistic that the US will sidestep steeper tariff rates, with hopes that Washington will reach trade agreements in the coming weeks with key partners like Japan and South Korea, according to Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. “That’s what the market has built in,” Saglimbene said. “If we don’t get that, then I think there is probably some risk that we would see higher near-term volatility if the White House implements some of these aggressive tariff measures.” With tariff effects spreading through the global supply chains, inflation-growth data and central bank reactions will continue to get close attention in the back half of the year.

The 5th round of Mutuum Finance presale has already sold out over 65%. It is priced at $0.03 in phase 5 and the price will spike by 16.67% in the next phase. The amount raised so far is over the $12.1 million barrier with over 13100 unique token holders. Smart money is already moving in, and those watching for what to buy before July ends are locking in their positions now, before the next leg up. In addition, Cardano (ADA) continues to hold ground in long-term portfolios, offering stability amid the rising momentum of new coins. Mutuum Finance is stealing the spotlight this summer. Steady Gains Keep Cardano on Track At the current price of approximately $0.63, Cardano (ADA) is a steady price as it exhibits a strong trend after slightly dropping at the beginning of this month. Advances in the Cardano ecosystem have continued to increase, as the scaling solution Hydra continues to gain greater use to enhance its transactions and make the ability to write and develop easier. Another driver can be the next Cardano Summit, which is conducted in the middle of July, especially when some information about governance or scaling tools is presented. All in all, ADA remains an interesting investment opportunity to long-term investors interested in a well-planned, gradually developing blockchain with strong fundamentals, thus completing the portfolio of more risky bets on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Strong Investor Demand Drives Mutuum Finance Presale Growth More than $12.1 million has been raised and over 13100 investors have invested in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as presale 5 soars. This shows investor confidence in the project during its early stages is increasing. MUTM is priced at $0.03 before a 17% spike in phase 6. Smart investors are rushing to catch this lowest price. Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract Lending Protocol Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a double-sided lending platform that will serve active as well as passive users of DeFi. Users will receive passive income from lending their USDT through stable passive income-generating smart contract pools providing stable passive income in the project’s Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending system. Additionally, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model permits lenders and borrowers to be as active as they like when it comes to swapping as it does not require a third party. The trend is more prevalent among customers of less secure assets. CertiK-Audited with an Additional $50K Bug Bounty for Enhanced Security Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch a stablecoin that is pegged to the US dollar (USD) on the Ethereum network. Besides, the project is audited by CertiK with a 95.0 trust score. This type of audit provides evidence of the readiness of the platform to become reliable and be institutional-graded transparent. Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty. The bounty will be rewarded on the basis of four levels of severity: critical, major, minor and low. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) $100,000 Giveaway Mutuum Finance values its new investors and has launched a $100,000 giveaway that will give 10 lucky winners $10,000 MUTM as a gesture of gratitude for the investors’ initial trust in the project. The crypto market is good in the first half of 2025, the future of the crypto market thus far is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Having raised more than $12.1 million, having more than 13,100 token holders, and just 65% of the Phase 5 being sold out, it is obvious that the ball is already rolling.

The filing , filed to recover 40,350 USDT (a stablecoin pegged to the value of the US dollar) that crypto company Tether is currently holding in frozen accounts, refers to the victims only as “Ivan” and “Mouna.” But coverage from crypto outlet NOTUS suggests they are Ivan Soto-Wright, co-founder and chief executive of MoonPay, and Mouna Ammari Siala, the company’s chief financial officer. The DOJ says that the two executives were scammed into moving funds to an account controlled by an individual they believed was Steve Witkoff, a high-profile US real estate developer and co-chair of President Donald Trump’s 2017 inaugural committee. Blockchain data analysis indicates that the USDT was transferred to a wallet associated with Binance. The wallet is associated with Ehiremen Aigbokhan, a Nigerian citizen residing in Lagos. The episode represents an unusual public case in which senior industry players, who had access to advanced crypto tools and security protocols, proved to be as susceptible to what investigators call a fairly simple form of social engineering as the average rank-and-file email user. Scammer employed ‘insulting typo’ to imitate a public figure Unlike other crypto-crimes that rely on hacking or exploiting blockchain vulnerabilities (and perhaps for that reason alone), this scam was executed through deception through discreet email manipulation. The scammers employed bogus email addresses nearly identical to correct ones — substituting a capital “I” for a lowercase “l” in domain names — to deceive their targets. In this situation, emails were sent from steve_witkoff@t47lnaugural.com and financersvp@t47lnaugural.com — addresses spoofing the names of well-known people and events. This practice, called typosquatting, is used frequently in phishing scams and has proven effective at scamming even professionals who are security aware. “IP geolocation data consistently showed emails from these accounts originating from Nigeria, and not the United States,” the DOJ filing says. According to the authorities, Aigbokhan likely obtained the USDT due to a scam involving an international money transfer in the US. The con artists didn’t have to hack into or exploit the blockchain in any way; they only needed a ruse and a convincing pitch to steal the funds. Wallet activity raises further doubts about MoonPay The filing noted that one of the wallets involved in the scam is a marked MoonPay wallet on Etherscan, suggesting that the individuals affected are likely Ivan Soto-Wright and Mouna Ammari Siala. As of press time, MoonPay has not yet publicly replied to requests for comment from multiple outlets, including The Block and NOTUS . The timing of the case is particularly delicate. And in the latest expansion, MoonPay, a popular payment infrastructure for cryptocurrency purchases, made its services available in only a few US states. Still, last month, the NYDFS granted it a BitLicense, which has the consequence of allowing the company to operate in all 50 United States. It is one of the most difficult-to-obtain crypto regulatory licenses in the US and vital for doing business in the financial capital. The incident may raise additional questions about MoonPay’s internal security controls , vetting processes, and executive oversight, particularly if the victims in this case had indeed used the official company wallets to conduct what seem to be personal or poorly vetted transactions. Amid the boom in crypto adoption, the case is a sobering reminder that no one is immune to digital fraud, not even the executives of companies that help build the infrastructure of the crypto economy.

Celestia’s 16% surge in one day has sparked new momentum, while Solana is drawing attention through a stablecoin trial with Japan’s Minna Bank. These moves show how fast sentiment can shift when strong fundamentals back the action. At the same time, BlockDAG is turning heads with a different approach. It’s entering the world of professional sports through new deals with the Seattle Seawolves and Seattle Orcas. Adding to the excitement, BlockDAG has launched a GLOBAL LAUNCH release, offering a discounted $0.0016 entry until August 11, an offer far below its Batch 29 rate of $0.0276. Celestia Recovery Signals Upside Celestia’s TIA spiked 16% within 24 hours after dropping 26% in the previous days. The quick rebound shows that buyers are stepping back in, even as over $2.9 million in spot selling was recorded. Analysts suggest the move wasn’t fear-based selling, but likely profit-taking. Currently, about 78% of TIA holders remain optimistic about future gains. The token is trading close to its upper Bollinger Band at $1.89, a zone analysts identify as an important resistance. Strong interest in derivatives also backs the price movement. If the momentum stays strong, the next ceiling could come into play soon. SOL Tests Stablecoin in Japan Solana is making new strides with a stablecoin experiment led by Minna Bank and Fireblocks. The project explores how Solana’s network, both public and permissioned, can support digital money transfers and settlements within traditional banking systems. This pilot is seen as an important step in proving blockchain’s place in real finance. By using Solana’s tech, Minna Bank wants to create a more efficient system for yen-based stablecoin activity. If results are positive, Solana could see broader usage in Japan’s digital currency space. This adds weight to the current SOL market analysis that points to long-term potential in regulated environments. BlockDAG Scores Big With Seattle Sports Deals BlockDAG is stepping into the spotlight, not just with its presale, but by going all-in on sports to bring blockchain into the mainstream. The platform has signed with the Seattle Seawolves, champions in Major League Rugby, becoming their Official Blockchain Partner. This partnership includes co-branded media, exclusive fan coins, and behind-the-scenes content aimed at deepening fan interaction. That’s not all. BlockDAG has also teamed up with the Seattle Orcas from Major League Cricket, expanding its reach to a global fanbase. Through this partnership, cricket followers will get player-focused digital content and blockchain-driven tools that connect them more closely with the game. These deals aren’t just for show; they’re helping build real engagement and pushing BlockDAG to a wider audience. BlockDAG is currently in Batch 29 with a coin price of $0.0276. But under the GLOBAL LAUNCH release, users can grab a special rate of $0.0016 until August 11. This discounted price could deliver a 3,025% return at the $0.05 launch price. So far, BlockDAG has raised $336 million and sold 23.8 billion coins. With momentum building fast, the project is setting itself apart from typical presales by combining tech with real-world presence. Looking Ahead Celestia is bouncing back fast with a 16% surge, showing how quickly confidence can return. Solana’s move into stablecoin testing with Minna Bank opens doors to financial system adoption, hinting at broader support ahead. But it’s BlockDAG that’s drawing fresh interest with a mix of sports visibility and a limited-time offer. The $0.0016 GLOBAL LAUNCH release price is available until August 11. This, along with its growing presence in rugby and cricket, makes it one of the top crypto projects catching attention this season.
