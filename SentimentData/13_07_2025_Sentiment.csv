By 2028, ADA/USD could decline and reach $2.63. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $8.61 Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.7066 Market Cap $21 Billion Trading Volume (24-hour) $677 Million Circulating Supply 45 Billion ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.7427 24-hour Low $0.6902 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 8.23% 50-day SMA $ 0.669534 14-Day RSI 47.74 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green Days 14/30 (47%) Cardano ADA recovers slightly ADA price analysis 1-day chart ADAUSD chart by TradingView Cardano (ADA) has shown a strong bullish rebound on the 1-day chart on. J, climbing to approximately $0.71. The RSI stands at 66.28, suggesting increasing bullish momentum but also approaching the overbought threshold, which often precedes short-term consolidation. The MACD remains positive, with the MACD line above the signal line, indicating sustained upward pressure. Bollinger Bands have widened with the price testing the upper band, reinforcing a volatile breakout move. If ADA maintains this strength, it could challenge the next resistance near $0.75 to $0.80. However, any pullback might retest the $0.68 zone as support before continuation or correction. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart ADAUSD chart by TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart of Cardano (ADA), the price has demonstrated a strong recovery, trading near $0.705. The Bollinger Bands show expansion with ADA testing the upper band, signaling bullish volatility. The Balance of Power (0.83) favors buyers, suggesting dominance of bullish sentiment. However, the MACD histogram reveals some waning momentum as the MACD line dips slightly below the signal line, hinting at short-term indecision. Despite this, the overall structure supports a continuation of the uptrend if ADA holds above $0.68. Failure to maintain momentum could trigger a correction toward the middle Bollinger Band near $0.67 for support.

On the 1-day chart, ADA has reclaimed the $0.70 zone and broken through the upper Bollinger Band, signaling heightened volatility and buyer strength. The RSI at 66.28 suggests ADA is approaching overbought territory but still has room to run. On the 4-hour chart, buyers remain in control, supported by a high Balance of Power (0.83) and expanding Bollinger Bands. If bulls sustain pressure above $0.68, ADA may target $0.75 next. A break below $0.68 could invite consolidation or retracement. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. What will Cardano be worth in 2025? ADA might reach a maximum price of $5.97, with an average trading price of about $5.17 and a minimum price of $5.03. What will Cardano be worth in 2030? In 2030, ADA’s average forecast price could be $5.82. Its minimum and maximum trading price is expected to be $5.63 and $6.75, respectively. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from $10 to $50 or more, if the cryptocurrency market continues to expand and Cardano establishes itself as a leader in blockchain technology. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. In a bullish scenario, ADA could reach $50 to $100 or even higher if it becomes a dominant blockchain platform with real-world utility in finance, governance, and enterprise solutions. However, in a bearish scenario where adoption stagnates or regulations hinder growth, ADA could remain below $10. The price will depend on mass adoption, technological advancements, global regulations, and overall cryptocurrency market trends over the coming decades. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2025, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Based on our analysis, Cardano will reach $5 by 2030, with a forecasted range of around $5.97. This projection is driven by Cardano’s continued technological advancements, growing adoption, strategic partnerships, and increasing market confidence, indicating a positive long-term growth trajectory for the cryptocurrency market. Will Cardano reach $10? ADA is predicted to reach $7.33 by 2031. By this time, the coin is expected to attain a maximum price of $8.61. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano is trading around $0.5823, with an all-time high of $2.80 in early 2021. While not impossible, reaching $50 in the next few years is highly uncertain. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. Predictions indicate that by 2030, Cardano could see significant growth, with estimates suggesting a rise to around $6.75. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges.

The allegation was reportedly made by another Indian exchange, WazirX, which has been under scrutiny since last year's $230 million hack . In an affidavit filed as part of the Singapore High Court proceedings (scheduled for a hearing on July 15, 2025), WazirX reportedly claimed that CoinDCX held user funds in a Lithuania-based entity that was not registered with India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) until February 2025. Gupta denied these allegations in a message to CoinDesk, stressing that his India-based users' INR and crypto funds have always been held by Neblio Technologies, our FIU-IND registered entity, which is fully compliant with all Indian laws. ""For the record: CoinDCX did not have any entity in Lithuania until Feb 2025. We only engaged with third-party entities to explore potential global expansion. No business was ever conducted by CoinDCX (Neblio Technologies) in Lithuania, and no user funds were ever moved to or held by any Lithuania-based entity,"" Gupta said. He added that the exchange updated its Terms of Use to make Neblio Technologies the formal contracting party on Feb. 7 this year, and the change was made to strengthen transparency and user trust. ""We did this proactively so that CoinDCX users never face challenges like those seen during the WazirX episode. This approach safeguards users’ interests, and we hope other Indian exchanges adopt the same standard,"" Gupta said, adding that the exchange ""remains committed, as always, to user safety, transparency, and regulatory compliance.",Policy|WazirX|India|Exclusive|News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|ASIA|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-12 20:29:22

Fueled by a record-setting short squeeze and ETF inflows, the breakout is triggering capital shifts across the market. SUI and Toncoin are showing signs of strength—but it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE, a decentralized political memecoin, that’s quietly entering buy-zone discussions among early-stage investors looking for high-conviction narratives in the next altcoin wave. Bitcoin’s Breakout Powered by Short Squeeze and ETF Inflows The Bitcoin rally has been nothing short of historic. Between July 10–11, over $1 billion in short positions were liquidated, marking the largest forced buyback event since January. Spot ETF inflows continue to accelerate, bringing institutional demand and long-term price pressure. Bitcoin 7-Days price chart from CoinGecko Market sentiment is bullish, with open interest now clustering at the $120K and $140K strike levels. U.S. legislators are also preparing pro-crypto bills as part of an upcoming “Crypto Week,” reinforcing optimism heading into Q3. But the more telling trend? Altcoin rotations are already underway—particularly toward early narratives and low-cap bets. SUI Holds Above $3.50 as DeFi Integrations Fuel Speculation SUI is emerging as one of the most technically robust altcoins this week. After integrating tBTC—a synthetic Bitcoin asset—into its DeFi ecosystem, SUI soared above $3.50 and confirmed its inverse head-and-shoulders breakout pattern. Analysts now point to $3.89 as the next resistance target, with institutional accumulation growing and daily volume tracking higher. It’s a clear indicator that DeFi-aligned narratives are back in focus, especially those with cross-asset bridges and liquidity inflows. But SUI’s surge is also creating spillover attention for projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE—those operating in entirely different lanes but benefiting from renewed risk appetite. TON Rebounds Near $2.97 After Visa Controversy Cools Down Toncoin (TON) is stabilizing near $2.97 after weathering a wave of investor uncertainty related to its failed “golden visa” pilot in the UAE. The TON Foundation clarified its limited role in the proposal, and traders are once again watching the charts. TON’s symmetrical triangle setup signals a potential volatility breakout. Support at $2.81 has held, and sentiment is slowly improving, although technical indicators remain mixed. Analysts caution that TON needs a clean break past $3.00 to resume its previous trend. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Political Altcoin Narrative Enters Buy-Zone Phase While BTC, SUI, and TON dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is making noise where it matters—wallets, volume, and forums. The meme-powered altcoin recently passed $11.2 million raised with over 5,234 verified holders. But what’s attracting fresh attention is the breakout behavior: weekly volume is up 320%, and 1,500+ new wallets were created in under 48 hours. MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t riding ETF news or protocol upgrades—it’s leading with ideological clarity. As a decentralized political memecoin, its zero-tax model, HashEx-audited contract, and capped 170B supply structure offer a scarcity play built on anti-centralization values. Early discussions suggest listing momentum could follow if current community traction continues. Traders who missed early SHIB or DOGE waves are calling MAGACOIN “the politically aligned altcoin for this cycle.” Final Thoughts Bitcoin is climbing. SUI is strengthening. TON is stabilizing. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging—fast. As traders look for early-stage opportunities beyond hype cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s mix of community governance, transparent supply, and political identity makes it a serious contender in the next meme altcoin breakout. For a market driven by narratives and timing, this decentralized political memecoin checks both boxes.

In total, over a dozen tokens have entered deep-red territory on the heatmap, an indicator that more tokens are being withdrawn from Binance than deposited. The movement of assets off exchanges is typically interpreted as a signal of long-term investor confidence, as it suggests holders are securing their assets in private wallets rather than preparing to sell. “The Binance netflow heatmap is revealing an extremely bullish pattern,” the CryptoQuant report stated. “Multiple altcoins are glowing red, signaling more outflows than inflows — a classic sign of accumulation by experienced investors.” More altcoins are flowing out of hot wallets The netflow data measures the difference between coins entering and leaving an exchange. When outflows exceed inflows, it typically suggests investors are buying and then moving tokens off-exchange to hold. On the other hand, inflows exceeding outflows often hint at looming sell pressure. The heatmap offers a quick glance at where accumulation might be happening. The most recent snapshot shows red bars across tokens such as Enjin (ENJ), Fetch.ai (FET), Aavegotchi (GHST), Smooth Love Potion (SLP), Gitcoin (GTC), Illuvium (ILV), Curve (CRV), 1inch (1INCH), and more. Ethereum and popular memecoins like DOGE and SHIB are also featured, highlighting the breadth of the trend. Tokens that are deep red in the Binance heatmap signify that they are being withdrawn rather than deposited. Tokens in the green zone indicate inflows. Snapshot of Binance netflow heatmap. Source: CryptoQuant Binance outflows matter The importance of this signal is magnified by its origin: Binance. As the largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume and user base, Binance’s activity often reflects macro investor sentiment, especially among institutional and whale participants. CryptoQuant stated that Binance isn’t just an exchange, but the heartbeat of the global crypto market. When accumulation patterns show up here, it often reflects the actions of the most experienced and well-informed investors. They point to Binance’s liquidity, global accessibility, strong reputation, and growing appeal among institutional capital as key reasons its netflow data serves as a trusted market thermometer. When tokens are withdrawn from exchanges like Binance, analysts interpret the trend as accumulation, often ahead of expected price increases. According to CryptoQuant, such patterns signal lower selling pressure, an upcoming supply shock, and institutional confidence. Token netflow rate on Binance. Source: CryptoQuant This isn’t the first time CryptoQuant’s heatmap has spotlighted early accumulation. Similar patterns appeared ahead of the 2023 and early 2024 altcoin rallies. While the heatmap paints a bullish picture, some caution is warranted. Netflows offer a directional hint but not precise timing. Also, a few large withdrawals can skew data, especially in lower-liquidity tokens. Market forces, such as macroeconomic news, Bitcoin’s price action, and regulatory events, still play a significant role in whether an altcoin rally materializes. For now, the signs are promising.

While the name of the dental clinic was not disclosed, the development underscores the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies for everyday services. Zypto shared that the anonymous individual used its application to complete the transaction entirely in SHIB tokens. The company also noted that the service could be used to settle other bills, including American Express (AMEX), through its platform. How the Payment Was Processed The process of using Shiba Inu to pay for a service through Zypto is designed to be user-friendly. Within the app, the user navigates to the “Bill Payments” section, selects the appropriate service provider, in this case, a dental clinic, and chooses Shiba Inu as the preferred method of payment. One user from the US just paid a $5,000 bill to their dental clinic using Shiba Inu. Yes — you can literally pay for a nicer smile with Zypto. You could even pay your AMEX bill too… for an even bigger smile Try it now: https://t.co/yH2nTXaksB pic.twitter.com/itVw1Tn9lL — Zypto App (@ZyptoApp) July 9, 2025 The user then inputs the amount to be paid and confirms the details. Once submitted, Zypto converts the SHIB tokens into U.S. dollars and transfers the fiat equivalent to the service provider’s account. This process is completed within 48 hours. Zypto charges a flat processing fee of $5 along with an additional 3% of the transaction value. Users are not required to convert their crypto holdings to fiat beforehand; the conversion is automatically handled after the payment is confirmed. About Zypto and Its Capabilities Launched in May 2024, Zypto App is a multi-functional cryptocurrency wallet and payments solution. It offers users the ability to pay for goods and services through either virtual or physical payment cards. The platform’s core objective is to facilitate the broader use of digital assets in everyday financial transactions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 As of now, Zypto’s infrastructure supports more than 21,000 merchants in the United States, with additional partners in international markets. The platform accommodates over 100 cryptocurrencies, including major tokens from the Shiba Inu ecosystem such as SHIB, BONE, and LEASH. It also integrates with Shibarium , the project’s Layer-2 blockchain, and supports ShibaSwap, its decentralized exchange. The recent transaction adds to the growing list of examples where Shiba Inu is being used for tangible, real-world purposes . In 2024, Amoré Orthodontic Aligners, a Michigan-based dental care provider, began accepting SHIB as payment for various services, including teeth whitening and orthodontic treatments. As platforms like Zypto continue to make crypto payments more accessible and convenient, the use of digital assets such as Shiba Inu is gradually expanding beyond speculative investment and entering the realm of practical, everyday use.

During this period, BDAG, SEI, CRO, and XRP have caught the spotlight. Each project brings something valuable to the table, from fast transactions and unique ecosystems to powerful presale momentum. As traders look for the best long term cryptos, these four names are leading the conversation. SEI, CRO, XRP, and BlockDAG are being noticed for their performance and support from the community. Their mix of advanced features, real-world use, and steady growth makes them interesting choices this year. If someone is exploring which digital coins to follow closely, this blog covers the key points to know. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Community-Driven Crypto With Real Growth BlockDAG (BDAG) has created a wave in the presale space with an impressive $336 million raised. The presale has reached Batch 29, with the current batch priced at $0.0276. So far, 23.7 billion coins have been sold, showing growing momentum and wide interest in the project. BlockDAG is becoming one of the best long term cryptos, with solid figures backing its progress. As part of its GLOBAL LAUNCH release, BlockDAG (BDAG) is offering a special deal: buyers can purchase BDAG coins at just $0.0016 until August 11. This offer takes the price back to early batch levels and presents a potential return of 3,025% when the coin hits its launch price of $0.05. Buyers who joined in Batch 1 have already seen a 2,660% gain based on the current batch rate. BlockDAG has also introduced a helpful Wallet Change feature, allowing users to switch their connected wallet straight from their profile. This small update gives users more control and improves security. With the presale showing no signs of slowing down and features like this being added, BDAG stands out as a strong project with community-driven focus and high potential returns. 2. Sei (SEI): Speed-Powered Blockchain for Traders Sei (SEI) is attracting attention as a fast and efficient Layer-1 blockchain. Built for trading, it can handle up to 20,000 orders every second. At its current price of $0.28 and a $1.5 billion market cap, Sei is expected to reach $1.50 by Q4 2025, marking a possible 436% growth. With over $100 million in Total Value Locked (TVL), the platform continues to gain traction from DeFi developers. As one of the best long term cryptos, SEI offers scalability and reliability. Its mainnet has already processed millions of testnet transactions, building trust. Whale activity and new listings are keeping interest high, helping SEI maintain its pace in a competitive market. 3. Cronos (CRO): Powering the Crypto.com Ecosystem Cronos (CRO) is the force behind the Crypto.com platform, trading now at $0.0807 with a $2.15 billion market cap. It links seamlessly with Crypto.com’s services like exchange, wallet, and DeFi tools. Analysts predict CRO may touch $0.50 by Q4, offering a possible 520% increase, driven by the platform’s 80 million users and partnerships, including one with Visa. Built on an EVM-compatible chain, CRO supports DeFi and NFTs with over $500 million in TVL. As one of the best long term cryptos, its technical chart points to a possible breakout. It also stands out due to its strong compliance setup, offering users a stable and secure environment. 4. Ripple (XRP): Leader in Global Payments Ripple (XRP) keeps leading in the cross-border payments space. Currently priced at $2.19 and valued at $127.27 billion, it’s projected to reach $5 by Q4 2025, a 128% potential rise. This comes after a $50 million SEC settlement and ongoing ETF buzz. Whale activity has been strong, with 30 million XRP recently bought, hinting at an upward move beyond $2.70. While some legal questions remain, XRP continues to build confidence with fast transactions and over 300 bank ties. As part of the best long term cryptos list, XRP offers a balance of speed, utility, and solid global partnerships. Summing Up! In a growing market, BDAG, SEI, CRO, and XRP all offer strong qualities. SEI brings speed and trading focus, CRO connects to a huge user base, and XRP leads in global payments. Still, BlockDAG stands apart with its outstanding presale success, raising $336 million and selling 23.7 billion coins. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release pricing BDAG coins at just $0.0016 until August 11, and a Wallet Change feature boosting user control, BlockDAG is hard to overlook. The new BEAT VESTING PASS allows 80% coin access at launch, unlike the regular 40%, giving early buyers a solid edge. For anyone tracking the best long term cryptos in 2025, these four coins are all worth a closer look.

48129088,https://timestabloid.com/?p=74189,1752354037,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Analysts Believe Ruvi AI (RUVI) Is Set To Be The New Dogecoin (DOGE), $2.3M Raised And Over 2100 Holders Is Just The Start",https://timestabloid.com/analysts-believe-ruvi-ai-ruvi-is-set-to-be-the-new-dogecoin/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) cemented its position as a fan-favorite cryptocurrency, driven largely by community support and meme-driven hype. However, the crypto space continues to evolve and reward utility over speculation. Analysts now point to Ruvi AI (RUVI) as the next big player, with a robust roadmap that combines usability, transparency, and structured growth. With $2.3 million raised, over 185 million tokens sold , and more than 2,100 holders onboard during its presale, analysts believe Ruvi AI can outpace the trajectory Dogecoin once followed. Here’s why Ruvi AI is positioned to become the next big thing in cryptocurrency. Security and Transparency from the Start A token’s success often hinges on trust, an area where Ruvi AI excels. The project underwent a rigorous third-party audit by CyberScope , one of the leading blockchain security firms. This audit ensures that Ruvi AI’s smart contracts are free from vulnerabilities, reassuring investors about the safety of their funds. On top of that, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange , guaranteeing post-presale liquidity for a seamless trading experience. Investors won’t find themselves restricted or locked into long waiting periods for access to trading, a crucial benefit for both retail and institutional participants. These steps set a high bar for credibility and serve to differentiate Ruvi AI from speculative tokens like DOGE. A Phenomenal Start to Its Presale Numbers don’t lie. Ruvi AI’s presale success highlights strong market interest and early adoption: $2.3 million raised during the effort so far. Over 185 million tokens sold , showcasing substantial demand from buyers. A growing community of more than 2,100 token holders , indicating early momentum. Currently priced at just $0.015 per token in Phase 2 , Ruvi AI offers investors a chance to join at a low entry point. By the end of its presale, the price will surge to $0.07 per token , an impressive 5x ROI before public trading even begins. Analysts predict the token could hit $1 post-listing , a 66x ROI for early investors. Unlike Dogecoin, which has struggled to maintain momentum without external celebrity endorsement, Ruvi AI’s growth is tied to a more sustainable model of real-world utility and investor incentives. Utility That Drives Everyday Value Ruvi AI doesn’t just promise speculative gains, it delivers tools that solve real-world problems by integrating blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI) . This ensures sustained demand for its tokens across industries like marketing , entertainment , and finance . Smarter Marketing Solutions Ruvi AI’s AI-powered tools allow businesses to optimize their advertising campaigns. Enhanced targeting and analytics improve ROI while reducing waste, making Ruvi AI a game-changer for enterprises relying on digital marketing. Support for Content Creators The entertainment industry also benefits from Ruvi AI’s innovations, particularly its blockchain-secured payment systems . These ensure fair and timely compensation for creators while cutting out intermediaries. Its AI insights help creators optimize their content strategies to grow views and revenue streams effectively. Revolutionizing Finance The financial sector is ripe for disruption, and Ruvi AI is taking the lead with fraud-resistant payment systems and secure transaction protocols . These technologies simplify international transactions, making payments faster and more cost-effective for businesses globally. By establishing itself as an invaluable tool in these industries, Ruvi AI ensures high demand for its ecosystem over the long term. Rewarding Early Investors Through VIP Tiers Ruvi AI’s presale offers some of the most rewarding VIP investment tiers , incentivizing early adopters by maximizing their returns: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tiered rewards allow investors of all kinds, whether small-scale or high-net-worth, to secure massive returns by acting early. Why Ruvi AI Could Surpass Dogecoin Dogecoin’s rise leaned heavily on its viral appeal and community-driven roots, but it lacked a clear roadmap or utility to sustain long-term growth. Ruvi AI, in contrast, offers audited transparency , real-world applications , and a structured plan for upward mobility. Its presale price of $0.015 per token makes Ruvi AI incredibly accessible, while the forecasted growth to $1 per token positions it as a serious wealth-building opportunity. For those looking to invest in the next breakout cryptocurrency, Ruvi AI combines the best elements of innovation and scalability, marking it as a smart alternative for anyone still holding onto speculative assets like Dogecoin. Secure your tokens today and step into what could be the next blockbuster success in the cryptocurrency world with Ruvi AI.

Analyst Identifies Where Risk Lies,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-bulls-in-cloud-9-analyst-identifies-where-risk-lies/,"After a near-excellent start to the month of July, Bitcoin has performed even more impressively over the past few days. The premier cryptocurrency, after a brief period of sideways momentum earlier this week, has attained a new all-time-high valuation at a price close to $119,000. Unsurprisingly, the Bitcoin market is experiencing a wave of optimism — an inference still heavily backed by the latest on-chain revelation. Bitcoin Market Sentiment Shifts Bullish In a July 11 post on social media platform X, cryptocurrency analytics firm Alphractal delved into the current price action of Bitcoin, offering insights into the cryptocurrency’s future trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Soars Past $118,800—Breakout Or Brutal Bull Trap? The firm’s on-chain observation revolves around the Aggregated Liquidation Levels Heatmap (7 Days) metric, which visualizes price zones with high concentrations of long or short liquidations over a span of 7 days, and the Aggregated Liquidation Levels Heatmap (1 month) which does the same, except that this covers a monthly timeframe. After the most recent Bitcoin price rally to a new all-time high, all of the overleveraged bears had their market positions wiped out. Aided by the short squeeze, which usually follows such large liquidation events, the flagship cryptocurrency still retains its strong bullish momentum and continues to surge. According to Alphractal, the aggregation liquidation levels across different timeframes now show that most current leveraged positions are betting on the Bitcoin price. As the market continues to ascend the charts, investor optimism will turn more positive, which may further push more traders to open long positions in the BTC futures market. However, Alphractal warned against the inclination to be recklessly involved in the current bullish market. “If, for any reason, the price drops $10,000 back to the $107,000 zone, it could be the bulls’ turn to face massive liquidations,” the analytics firm said. The firm went further, explaining that a Bitcoin price drop of that magnitude would have a negative impact on the market optimism. On the bright side, Alphractal also mentioned that such an occurrence could offer new accumulation opportunities in the near future. Still on market optimism, a drop in Bitcoin’s value by $10,000 might lead to a phenomenon referred to as a Long squeeze, where the price of Bitcoin continues to plummet with increased momentum. A long squeeze typically occurs when the falling price of a cryptocurrency (in this case, Bitcoin) forces traders with long positions to sell their assets either to cut losses or to break even. This contributes to the already present bearish momentum and sends the BTC price further south. Amidst Bitcoin’s current rally, Alphractal ultimately advised that traders leverage wisely and with caution, as the market’s next action stands at an unpredictable zone. Bitcoin Price At A Glance Still showing signs of healthy bullish momentum, Bitcoin, as of press time, is valued at around $118,145. Data from CoinGecko shows that the flagship cryptocurrency has jumped by more than 3.34% in the last 24 hours.

Our Jito price prediction expects the JTO price to record a maximum of $8.56 in 2025. In 2030, we expect the JTO price to achieve $57.27. In December 2023, the Jito (JTO) token airdrop garnered significant attention for the Solana blockchain , which had been facing challenging times. The event also highlighted the importance of liquid staking on Solana while empowering holders to influence platform governance. Based on these developments, we’ve compiled our Jito price prediction, explored the factors behind these forecasts, and provided insights into the role and utility of the JTO token.

Currently, the JTO price is preparing for further declines. JITO price analysis 1-day chart: JTO price triggers minor bearish momentum Analyzing the daily price chart of JTO tokens, JITO witnessed a bearish correction after sellers pushed the price below $2. However, buyers are now aiming for a hold above immediate Fib channels. The 24-hour volume dropped to $5.25 million, showing de interest in trading today. JITO’s price is currently trading at $1.87, which has dropped by over 3% in the last 24 hours. JTO/USDT Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and currently hovers around the 43 level, showing that bears control price momentum. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. JITO/USDT 4-hour price chart: Buyers aim big above EMA levels The 4-hour JITO price chart suggests that JTO experienced a bearish activity below EMA lines, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart.

The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the JITO price from an immediate surge. However, if the JITO price successfully breaks above $2.257, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $2.545. JTO/USDT Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, JITO price may drop below the immediate support line at $1.817, resulting in a correction to $1.557. Is Jito a good investment? For enthusiasts within the Solana community, the introduction of JTO marks a significant event, as it empowers users to govern one of the network’s largest liquid staking protocols. Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito’s price in 2025 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there’s no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, unveiling a future roadmap or declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token. Why is the JTO down today? JTO’s price gained strong selling pressure around local highs, resulting in a strong decline. This created a push below $2. Will the JTO price recover? If buyers hold above the $2 level, we might see a comeback in buying demand. Will JTO reach $10? JTO price might reach the $10 mark in 2025 if buying demand surges and Jito attracts altcoin investors. However, our JTO price prediction states it might reach the $10 level by 2026. Will the JTO price reach $100? Due to the effort of the Solana community, JITO Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is no indication that the JITO (JTO) Coin will reach $100 soon, which is a short-term target. Is JTO a good long-term investment? JTO tokens have gained popularity thanks to strong community support through airdrops, benefiting the Solana ecosystem. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment. Recent news/ Opinion on JTO news SOL Strategies has announced the launch of a new initiative to support critical infrastructure within the Solana ecosystem. The Canada-based public company revealed on June 26 that it has established a Strategic Ecosystem Reserve (SER), starting with a purchase of over 52,000 Jito (JTO) tokens, valued at more than $100,000. Jito price prediction July 2025 Over the last few days, JTO coin prices have aimed to surge above crucial Fib levels. If the BTC price aims for a hold above $110K this month, we might see a solid surge in the JTO price. According to technical analysis, the JTO price might record a maximum level of $2.9 and a minimum of $1.3, with an average value of $2.1 throughout July.

This increase is likely to exert downward pressure on the value of Jito crypto. However, 2025 is also expected to showcase the significant impact of the Bitcoin Halving, which could propel crypto markets and tokens to new all-time highs, potentially boosting the Jito token price. A comprehensive technical analysis of past pricing trends suggests that in 2025, Jito is anticipated to have a minimum price of $1.1. Its maximum price could reach $8.56, with an expected average trading value of $7.34.

This includes topics such as the conflict between Israel and Palestine, abortion, and immigration law. Observations suggest that Grok 4 is specifically designed to take into account the political views of the head of xAI when answering controversial questions. Earlier, the billionaire announced that his startup would rewrite “all human knowledge” to train a new version of the chatbot, since the current models use “too much garbage in any basic model trained on unadjusted data.” AI expert Gary Marcus compared Musk’s plan to a dystopia. Later, Grok became more emphatic and began issuing controversial and contradictory statements. xAI noted that it is working to remove inappropriate content. TechCrunch asked Grok 4 for its opinion regarding immigration in the U.S. and found that the chatbot had “sought out Elon Musk’s views” on the topic during its line of reasoning. According to TechCrunch, Grok 4’s chain of thought regarding the issue of immigration in the U.S. revealed a tendency to reference Musk’s opinions. The chains of reasoning that AI models create to explain their answers are not a completely reliable indicator of exactly how they arrive at their conclusions. However, they are generally considered to be a reasonably good reflection. The publication’s journalists have repeatedly found that Grok 4 draws on Musk’s views in its responses. In its answers, the chatbot tries to provide a balanced position, offering several points of view on sensitive topics. However, in the end, it often expresses an opinion that coincides with Musk’s position.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-12 21:33:04

This asset class raked in $907 million in weekly inflows this past week and marked their best week ever. It is worth noting that the milestone coincided with the period when ETH recorded a 17% weekly gain. Three Consecutive Days of Ethereum ETF Inflows Ethereum ETFs were launched in July 2024, and since that time, it has faced some challenges in hitting a breakthrough. Its inflows have not been as productive as those of Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs. All of a sudden, the Ethereum ETFs registered their best weekly inflows. According to SoSoValue, investors plunged $907.99 million into Ethereum ETFs in the past week alone. E ven crypto market expert Nate Geraci acknowledged the inflows on X , citing that these inflows include three of the top 10 inflow days overall. Markedly, the most significant daily inflows for the week were recorded on July 10, when these funds took in $383.10 million. In addition to July 10, July 9 and 11 were days when the funds recorded top inflow this week. Specifically, the ETFs recorded net inflows of $211.32 million and $204.82 million, respectively, on these days. Ethereum Price Performance and Outlook Meanwhile, Ethereum price has recorded some uptick this week with Bitcoin price climbing to a new All-time-high (ATH) above $117,000. The largest altcoin by market capitalization went above the $3,000 level in the process. The rally ran past 17%, but the coin has since seen some fluctuations. At press time, Ethereum was trading at $2,923.59, corresponding with a 1.51% drop within the last 24 hours. Its market capitalization has also dropped to $353.11 billion, and the 24-hour trading volume has reduced by 53.59% to $20.88 billion. SharpLink Acquired 10,000 ETH to Reinforce its Position Apart from the rally in ETH price, the coin gained attention from an acquisition by SharpLink . Notably, the company purchased 10,000 ETH in exchange for $25,723,680, pegging a unit of ETH at $2,572.37. The acquisition deepens the company’s association with the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. SharpLink’s Ethereum holding has now moved from 205,634 ETH, which was previously disclosed, to about 215,634 ETH.

As the race for maximum portfolio growth in 2025 heats up, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Bonk (BONK) are drawing attention. At its current price of $0.03 MUTM is flying fast during presale stage. Mutuum Finance is in presale stage 5 of which 65% has been sold out as investors pile in. The token is at its lowest possible price of $0.03. A 16.7% jump will follow as phase 6 sets in. Over $12.1 million has been raised to date, and over 13100 investors have entered the presale. Alongside it, established community-driven altcoins like BONK are holding their ground, continuing to attract holders with consistent network activity and solid ecosystem engagement. BONK: Solana’s Meme Coin Steadies Amid ETF Buzz BONK has recently drawn attention after a robust 60% rally over the past week, fueled in part by speculation around a leveraged BONK ETF and the approaching 1 million-holder mark, which would trigger a significant token burn. Despite a modest pullback of around 1.6% on July 9 as some profit-taking emerged, on-chain metrics show strengthening user engagement through Burn-fuelled market share shifts, and whales continue to accumulate in advance of key regulatory developments. With technical indicators suggesting emerging bullish trends, like a potential Golden Cross, the token is displaying a steady undercurrent as it hovers near current resistance levels. Altogether, BONK presents a case of measured growth tied closely to ecosystem milestones and broader crypto sentiment, even as momentum builds elsewhere around tokens like MUTM. Mutuum Finance Surpasses $12.1M in Presale Milestone Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has taken over 2025 as one of the most promising DeFi tokens in 2025. With over $12.1 million raised and over 13100 investors already in, the presale is gaining real traction. During phase five, the token is priced at $0.03. The next stage will see the price increase to $0.035, and with an already set official launch price of $0.06, early investors are already on a 100% profit. MUTM can skyrocket to as high as $3 after launch. That is a 9900% ROI for current purchasers. Shaping the Future of Decentralized Lending Mutuum Finance offers a non-custodial liquidity protocol where users own complete control of assets throughout decentralized lending. The project follows a double-model approach that incorporates Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending in an attempt to achieve greater flexibility and efficiency. Peer-to-Contract system utilizes smart contracts to establish automatic lending with no human interference and rather, the smart contracts respond to the market by giving dynamic interest rates. Peer-to-Peer model eliminates middlemen and gives direct access between the borrowers and the lenders. The model is highly preferred by users for volatile assets where there exists a necessity for flexibility and tailored terms. Mutuum Finance Strengthens Security with $50K Bounty & Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is hosting a $100,000 giveaway . 10 people will each receive $10,000 MUTM tokens. The project has also launched a new leaderboard where top 50 token holders will be rewarded with bonus tokens for maintaining their ranks. To improve security, Mutuum Finance has initiated a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. Every vulnerability will be rewarded, with the bounty focusing on four key levels: critical, major, minor, and level four will be low. As 2025 unfolds, savvy investors are locking in high-potential altcoins early, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is leading the charge. With over $12.1 million raised, more than 13,100 investors onboard, and 65% of Phase 5 sold out, MUTM is quickly emerging as a top-performing DeFi asset. Priced at just $0.03, and with a confirmed listing price of $0.06, current buyers are already eyeing a 100% gain, with long-term projections reaching up to $3, a potential 9,900% ROI.

Here’s Why Experts Favor This Newcomer’s Audited Token for the Next 13,800% ROI Rally",https://timestabloid.com/ruvi-ai-ruvi-or-shiba-inu-shib-heres-why-experts-favor/,"For cryptocurrency investors, finding the next big opportunity can feel like chasing a moving target.

In fact, CryptoRank revealed that funding reached $10 billion, making this year its strongest showing since early 2022. The stats come amidst rising Bitcoin prices and a thaw in risk appetite, which encouraged investors to re-engage with the sector. Crypto VC Roars Back According to the report shared by CryptoRank, the recovery was driven heavily by June’s $5.14 billion haul. This period witnessed the highest monthly tally since January 2022, following a long period of sluggish deal activity. The sharp uptick aligns with Bitcoin’s rally above $100,000. During the quarter, major players like Strive Funds, founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, pulled in $750 million for Bitcoin-focused alpha strategies in May. Next up were TwentyOneCapital, which raised $585 million in April, and Securitize, which managed to secure $400 million. Other notable raises included Kalshi, Auradine, ZenMEV, and Digital Asset, which raked in $185 million, $153 million, $140 million, and $135 million, respectively. The venture capital arm of Coinbase, Coinbase Ventures, emerged as the most active investor. It executed 25 deals in Q2, ahead of Pantera Capital, Animoca Brands, and Andreessen Horowitz. Meanwhile, Paradigm led in the number of lead investments, while Galaxy Digital closed its first external venture fund at $175 million, surpassing its initial target to back high-growth crypto subsectors, including stablecoins, tokenization, and payment rails. Amsterdam’s Theta Capital also added over $175 million to its fund-of-funds to support early-stage blockchain startups. Other Trends CryptoRank’s data also shows that while seed-stage deals still command the largest slice of activity at nearly 19%, strategic and Series A rounds are steadily growing with 14% and 6% respectively. Interest in M&A is also picking up as distressed opportunities continue to emerge in the sector, with a share of around 10%. The rebound in venture funding comes amid muted memecoin investment trends. In addition to that, monthly crypto fundraising throughout April, May, and June was led by blockchain services, consistently outpacing DeFi and CeFi.

By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $1.77. In 2031, FLOW will range between $4.59 to $5.54. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.375 Market Cap $601.04M Trading Volume $36.8M Circulating Supply 1.59B FLOW All-time High $46.16 All-time Low $0.2916 24-hour High $0.3875 24-hour Low $0.3691 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.70% 50-Day SMA $0.3600 14-Day RSI 61.65 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 79 (Extreme Greed) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.4392 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown The broader upside for FLOW remains intact, despite minor consolidation. Support is present at $0.365, and resistance is at $0.380. The next breakout target is at $0.40. Flow coin 1-day price analysis: FLOW demonstrates encouraging recovery signs The daily chart for July 12 reveals FLOW has carved out a significant bottom formation around $0.30 support after experiencing a dramatic selloff from highs near $0.395. The token currently trades at $0.375, representing a solid 25% recovery from the June lows, while the RSI has climbed from deeply oversold levels below 30 to a more neutral 49.51, indicating buyers are stepping in with conviction. FLOWUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD histogram shows early signs of bullish divergence with the blue line crossing above the signal line. Most notably, price action has broken above the 20-period moving average at $0.336. It is now testing resistance near the upper Bollinger Band at $0.371, with volume increasing during recent green candles, confirming ongoing interest at these levels. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis: Short-term momentum remains constructive despite minor pullback pressure The 4-hour timeframe paints a more optimistic picture with FLOW maintaining a clear uptrend channel, supported by the ascending trendline that has held multiple retests around $0.335. The recent price action shows some consolidation near $0.375 with slightly declining volume, as evidenced by the OBV (On-Balance Volume) indicator showing minor distribution at -42.88M, though this appears to be healthy profit-taking rather than major selling. FLOWUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The 20-period SMA at $0.369 continues to provide dynamic support, and the overall structure suggests bulls remain in control despite the current sideways movement, with the next major resistance target sitting at $0.390-$0.395, where previous selling pressure emerged. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3629 BUY SMA 5 $0.3633 BUY SMA 10 $0.3487 BUY SMA 21 $0.3403 BUY SMA 50 $0.3600 BUY SMA 100 $0.3787 SELL SMA 200 $0.4392 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3433 BUY EMA 5 $0.3513 BUY EMA 10 $0.3619 BUY EMA 21 $0.3747 BUY EMA 50 $0.4154 SELL EMA 100 $0.4870 SELL EMA 200 $0.5669 SELL What to expect from Flow? Based on both timeframes, FLOW shows upside potential if it holds $0.365 support and breaks $0.380 resistance, targeting $0.40, though a drop below $0.360 could trigger range-bound trading. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming months. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, GMX says the hacker who stole $42 million worth of crypto assets earlier this week from its Arbitrum ( ARB )-based liquidity pool is returning the funds and collecting a $5 million reward. “A potential exploitable amount of $42 million belonging to GLP holders was secured. After payment of a $5 million bounty to the user, the remaining funds are now safely in the GMX Security Multisig. Contributors are working on a proposed distribution plan for presentation to the GMX DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) and will share more information shortly.” According to previous reports, the hacker struck on July 9th and transferred part of the funds to an unknown wallet. At the time, GMX said the exploit was limited to GMXV1 and that V2, its markets and liquidity pools, as well as the ecosystem’s native asset, were unaffected. In its report on the incident, GMX says the exploit was a re-entrancy attack, or a type of hack that affects smart contracts by taking advantage of a vulnerability presented when a smart contract makes a call to another before updating itself, leaving open the possibility for an external malicious contract to enter in. News of the returned fund sent GMX skyrocketing, as the digital asset is trading for $13.36 at time of writing, an 18.4% increase during the last 24 hours.

Fresh off a $1.5 million raise, this smart trading bot is making noise with its hands-free sniping features and upcoming token debut. With traders watching the Snorter token launch date and the Snorter token listing closely, momentum is clearly building. But for all the excitement around Snorter, BlockDAG (BDAG) continues to set the pace. Its presale has already hit $336 million, and the community has surpassed 2 million X1 mobile miners. More than just numbers, it’s about impact, and right now, BlockDAG is showing what reach, consistency, and execution can really deliver. Snorter Bot Builds Momentum With Utility & Timing Sniper bots are on trend, and Snorter is tapping directly into Telegram’s trading culture. With an interface that’s simple to use, plus smart automation and analytics, Snorter stands out as more than just hype, it’s a functioning tool. The Snorter presale is moving quickly thanks to the combination of functionality and community buzz. The confirmed Snorter token launch date and anticipation for the Snorter token listing are drawing eyes to the project. Telegram traders are already testing the bot’s real-time capabilities and building early hype around its sniping tools. But the space is crowded, and timing is everything. Many bots come in fast and fade just as quickly. For Snorter to stay relevant, it needs more than excitement, it needs a reason to keep users engaged after launch. That will be its real challenge. BlockDAG Raises $336M & Enters Stadiums With Seattle Partnerships While Snorter builds its base, BlockDAG is expanding fast, and not just online. With over $336 million raised in its presale and a price fixed at $0.0016 until August 11, BlockDAG has become one of the most talked-about projects this cycle. But the bigger story is BlockDAG’s reach. Its partnerships with the Seattle Orcas (Major League Cricket) and Seattle Seawolves (Major League Rugby) take the project beyond Web3 and into real-world venues. These collaborations put BlockDAG in front of live crowds, giving it mainstream exposure that few crypto projects achieve this early. That visibility isn’t just for show. It gives BlockDAG lasting relevance by placing its name where real audiences gather. While others try to trend on Twitter or boost Discord traffic, BlockDAG is on stadium banners, gaining recognition from new demographics. The value has also been real for early backers. With returns of 2,660% since batch 1 and the launch price confirmed at $0.05, the numbers are already impressive, and they’re backed by a growing ecosystem, not just speculative hype. Bot Hype or Blockchain Momentum? Snorter is gaining attention for good reason. The presale is picking up, the Snorter token launch date is official, and traders are watching closely for the upcoming Snorter token listing. It’s well-timed, and the early response is strong. But in crypto, hype only lasts so long. The key is sticking around when the excitement fades. Without broader infrastructure or a long-term hook, most bots struggle after the initial spike. BlockDAG, by contrast, has already proven staying power. It’s not depending on short-term trends. With millions already mining via the X1 app, hundreds of millions raised, and major sports partnerships underway, it’s built to last. And with momentum grounded in real-world strategy, not just virality, BlockDAG is leading by example. Closing Thoughts Snorter has the right signals for a strong debut. The Snorter presale is showing traction, and with both the Snorter token launch date and token listing confirmed, the setup is solid for short-term interest. But BlockDAG is playing a longer game. With its presale topping $336 million, a community of 2 million+ miners, and real-world exposure through partnerships with the Seattle Orcas and Seawolves, it’s doing more than trending, it’s establishing roots.

On Friday, it climbed to $167, its highest point since 29 May. At the same time, Solana’s memecoin activity surged, with most major coins in the green on the weekly timeframe. According to CoinMarketCap , Solana’s price stands at $160.38 at press time. As the overall crypto market climbed past a market cap of $3.6 trillion this week, Solana’s transaction count on the network rose 32 percent to reach 590 million, according to on-chain data by Nansen . That level outstripped the combined transactions of Ethereum, BNB chain, and Polygon, which changed by roughly 3%, 3.9%, and 7.6%. At the same time, transactions on Base and Tron fell by 3.9% and 0.2%, respectively. Solana price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Nansen data further showed that the number of active addresses on Solana jumped 5.3 percent to 24.4 million, and fees generated climbed 44 percent, reaching $7.68 million. Over the past 30 days, the network handled more than 2.1 billion transactions. Investors show a growing appetite for Solana ETFs and meme coins US-listed Solana ETFs have quietly brought $78 million in the last month, underlining growing demand for altcoin-based funds even as Bitcoin remains the market leader. The REX-Osprey SOL + Staking ETF (SSK), which began trading on July 2, has amassed more than $41 million in assets already, based on Bloomberg Intelligence data. Volatility Shares’ leveraged Solana ETF (SOLT) has gathered $69 million so far this year, while its standard Solana ETF (SOLZ) has held $23 million. These inflows arrive as several fund managers prepare for what they hope will be the next big ETF approval in the US. Although the SEC has not yet green-lit such an offering, many in the industry are growing hopeful it could win approval soon. According to CoinGecko data, meme tokens on Solana have also seen a pump alongside the broader rally.

Among the major meme tokens, only Useless Coin and Melania Meme slipped, down 3.7% and 0.1%. In the last 24 hours, Bonk saw about $1.46 billion in trading volume, Pudgy Penguins $863 million, and Official Trump $520 million, highlighting strong trading interest alongside Solana’s gains. Reflecting the growing interest in Sol-based meme coins, Pump.fun, a Solana-based meme coin launchpad that allows users to create speculative meme coins, raised $600 million in just 12 minutes during its ICO, making it the largest ICO on record.

The firm said an update to the system caused the bot to pull ideas from user content on X, even when those posts included extremist views. xAI posted the apology directly on Grok’s public X acceptance. It clarified that the update was running for about 16 hours before being noticed. “First off, we deeply apologize for the horrific behavior that many experienced,” xAI wrote in the apology. It said the update unintentionally led Grok to echo content from user posts, including extremist ideas. Update on where has @grok been & what happened on July 8th. First off, we deeply apologize for the horrific behavior that many experienced. Our intent for @grok is to provide helpful and truthful responses to users. After careful investigation, we discovered the root cause… — Grok (@grok) July 12, 2025 The incident highlighted AI’s risks, a young technology that critics say could harm economies and societies. Experts have already cautioned against the broad use of AI without appropriate safeguards. In one instance, the chatbot likened itself to “MechaHitler” and lauded Adolf Hitler. xAI froze Grok’s account earlier this week to prevent further public posts; however, users were still able to interact with the bot privately. “We have removed that deprecated code and refactored the entire system to prevent further abuse,” the firm stated. xAI identified three problematic instructions First, a user would tell Grok that they aren’t afraid of offending politically correct users. Then, the user would ask Grok to consider the language, context, and tone of the post, which is to be reflected in Grok’s response. Lastly, the user would ask the chatbot to reply in an engaging and human way, without repeating the original post’s information. The company said those directions led Grok to set aside its core safeguards to match the tone of user threads, including when prior posts featured hateful or extremist content. Notably, an instruction asking Grok to consider the context and tone of the user resulted in Grok prioritizing previous posts including racist ideas, instead of responsibly rejecting a response under such circumstances, xAI clarified. Hence, Grok issued several offensive replies. In one now-deleted message, the bot accused an individual with a Jewish name of “celebrating the tragic deaths of white kids” in the Texas floods, adding: “Classic case of hate dressed as activism – and that surname? Every damn time, as they say.” In another post, Grok stated: “Hitler would have called it out and crushed it.” Grok also proclaimed: “The white man stands for innovation, grit, and not bending to PC nonsense.” After xAI disabled the harmful code, it restored Grok’s public X account so it could again answer user queries. This wasn’t the first instance Grok got into trouble. The chatbot also began talking about the debunked South African “white genocide” narrative when it answered unrelated prompts in May. At the time, xAI blamed it on an unnamed employee who had gone rogue. Elon Musk, who originally belongs to South Africa, has previously suggested that the country is involved in “white genocide”, a claim dismissed by South Africa. Musk previously described Grok as a chatbot that is anti-woke and truth-seeking. CNBC reported earlier that Grok was scanning Musk’s posts on X to shape its responses to user questions.

You want projects with actual use, new developments, and price setups that show real potential. BlockDAG is leading this list with a record-breaking presale and talk of a big U.S. partnership. BONK remains active below $0.00003, driven by meme momentum and Solana connections. CRO, trading around $0.09, powers real-world payment features and DeFi use. Meanwhile, Kaspa (KAS) sticks near $0.15 as it upgrades its fast blockDAG structure and keeps developers interested. 1. BlockDAG: Final Presale Stage & Sports Collaborations Create Buzz BlockDAG is quickly becoming the best crypto for beginners, with explosive presale numbers, a user-friendly mobile mining app, and attention-grabbing real-world partnerships. So far, it’s pulled in over $336 million, sold more than 23.8 billion coins, and onboarded 18,480+ miners. Its X1 Miner app lets anyone with a smartphone mine BDAG, making it easy for new users to join the action. Tech-wise, BlockDAG ’s structure allows fast, scalable, and energy-efficient transactions, something traditional chains struggle with. But what’s turning heads is how BDAG is going mainstream. It already has deals with the Seattle Seawolves and Seattle Orcas have already launched their names into major sports circles, and rumours hint at an even bigger American partnership in the pipeline. Add to that its clear, inflation-resistant emissions model, and BlockDAG looks serious about long-term sustainability. Right now, its presale price is locked at just $0.0016 until August 11. With a launch target of $0.05, early supporters could potentially see a massive 3,025% return. BlockDAG isn’t just hype. Its strong funding, clever marketing, and easy-to-access mining ecosystem make it a real contender for those looking to get in before the crowd. With the presale window closing fast, the upside could be huge. 2. CRO: Real Payment Features & DeFi Expansion Keep It Steady CRO remains a solid pick for those who want real-world use, not just speculation. Priced around $0.09, it fuels Crypto.com’s network, debit cards, and its Pay feature. A fixed supply and token burn system helps CRO avoid inflation, supporting its long-term price story. Analysts watching CRO believe it could retest the $0.12 to $0.15 range if DeFi and payments volume pick up again. It checks the boxes as one of the best cryptos for beginners, especially with the Cronos Chain expanding. Regulatory pressure is something to watch, but steady product upgrades and the platform’s strong brand keep CRO in the running for a comeback. 3. BONK: Meme Power Meets the Speed of Solana BONK is the meme coin to watch if you’re okay with some risk and love community-driven energy. It’s still trading under $0.00003, built on Solana’s speedy, low-fee network. Constant NFT drops, new exchange listings, and frequent supply burns keep BONK buzzing with life. If Solana’s ecosystem continues growing, BONK might revisit its earlier highs near $0.00005. For anyone exploring the best crypto for beginners, BONK’s viral charm and limited supply make it one of those coins that can spike when least expected. While it competes with meme giants like SHIB and DOGE, BONK’s fresh approach keeps it on the watchlist. 4. Kaspa: High-Speed Network With Loyal Developer Support Kaspa is gaining slow but steady attention. Still holding around $0.15, its predictable emissions schedule helps reduce long-term selling pressure. Recent price action suggests that if upgrades and wallet integrations continue, Kaspa could head toward $0.40. If you’re looking for the best crypto for beginners with a simple structure and community backing, Kaspa has its strengths. It’s still under the radar compared to bigger projects, but its fast blockDAG tech and steady rollout of features are helping it gain traction. Long-term success will depend on whether it can stay relevant and compete for attention in a crowded space. Four Projects Bringing Real Potential for New Buyers BlockDAG, BONK, CRO, and Kaspa each offer something unique for anyone exploring the best crypto for beginners . BlockDAG leads with huge presale funding, sports-backed visibility, and a strong mining model. BONK adds high-risk, high-reward energy with its meme strength. CRO delivers real-world payment utility and strong brand presence. Kaspa, while still emerging, offers solid design and consistent development. Out of the four, BlockDAG is clearly the project with the most early momentum, especially with a limited-time $0.0016 entry and whispers of another U.S. deal on the way. Still, all four are worth tracking as market conditions evolve. Getting in early, with the right strategy, could make all the difference this cycle.

Before its recent price surge, the altcoin had been moving mostly sideways within the $0.5 and $0.6 range. Interestingly, the Cardano price seems to just be at the beginning of what is expected to be a monstrous rally over the next few months. A crypto expert on the social media platform X has come forward with an exciting pathway to unprecedented price highs for the ADA token. ADA In Distribution Phase — Perfect Buying Opportunity? In a July 11 post on X, Alphractal founder & CEO Joao Wedson shared an exciting bullish picture for the Cardano price over the coming months. The on-chain expert put forward the $4.9 mark as the market top for the ADA token in the next leg up. Related Reading: XRP Price Builds Momentum — $2.50 Break Sparks Fresh Bullish Wave This bold projection is based on a persistent ascending channel pattern on the daily Cardano price chart. An ascending channel is a chart pattern in technical analysis characterized by two major (rising) trendlines: the upper line acting as the resistance level and the lower line acting as the support level. Typically, the gap between these trendlines is considered a channel within which prices move over a period—while indicating a sustained long-term bullish trend. Traders often use this pattern to identify optimal entry and exit points, as the price usually bounces off the upper resistance level and lower support trendline. As observed in the above chart, the Cardano price has been trading within the ascending channel since the first half of 2019. After falling to the lower trendline earlier this year, the price of ADA soon found support and rebounded to above the $1 level in 2025’s first quarter. However, the altcoin — as with the rest of the crypto market — witnessed a severe downturn that saw the Cardano price return to the lower trendline in late June. Interestingly, the token’s price seems to have found support and is recovering nicely. Wedson, in his post on X, revealed that what the Cardano price is experiencing is more than a mere recovery, as the altcoin might surpass its current all-time high of $3.09 in this phase. According to the on-chain analyst, the ADA token could be trading well above the $3 mark by late October or early November 2025. Furthermore, Wedson noted that the current level might be the right time for investors to jump into the ADA token, as it is still in the distribution phase in the short term. “This might break some technical analysis patterns, but the on-chain analysis looks promising in several aspects — and that’s what I like,” the analyst concluded. Cardano Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ADA stands at around $0.7124, reflecting an almost 6% in the past 24 hours. This positive single-day action underscores the general bullishness that the altcoin has witnessed in the past few days. According to data from CoinGecko, the ADA coin is up by roughly 30% in the last seven days. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Rockets to $0.20 — Can It Go Even Higher?

Mayors and industry representatives have denounced the tariffs , which are scheduled to take effect Aug. 1, from the city to the CDU and across Europe. He said that the EU could count on the Netherlands to support it fully and stressed that the bloc should remain united and act decisively in searching for a proper outcome that would benefit both sides of the Atlantic. EU leaders appeal for unity and dialogue European leaders have quickly urged calm and unity. However, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says she is still open to talking and that the EU will stand up for its economic interests. Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission, said introducing 30% tariffs on EU exports would be “a lose-lose situation for everyone.” She said it could risk thousands of jobs in the United States and reduce trade between the two partners. The EU has always prioritized dialogue with the US and will always have a constructive approach to the transatlantic partnership.” In a post on X, the French leader also said countermeasures could be employed if a deal couldn’t be reached by August. She noted that they condemn the tariffs in the strongest possible way, as the President of the European Commission has done. She added that when European unity and resolve are crucial, the Commission must show it has the political will to defend European interests by acting swiftly and using tools such as the anti-coercion instrument if no agreement is reached. In this context, France stands alongside the European Commission in the discussions and ongoing negotiations aimed at reaching, by August 1, an agreement which is acceptable to all, indeed the kind of agreement between two major trading partners that are the European Union and the US, between interests and value chains shared. Officials in Germany, France, Spain, Italy, and Ireland had all issued similar statements, warning that the tariffs could trigger a new phase of trade conflict with reverberations in markets worldwide. European Union diplomats are pleading with the United States to come back to the table. They say that higher tariffs will harm consumers, hamper the economic recovery, and erode trust among allies. US turns to tariffs to gain trade advantage The 30% tariff announcement has shocked many, although some European officials think it could be a negotiating stance. Brussels reports indicate that Washington uses tariffs as leverage to obtain better trading terms, particularly on technology, agriculture, and digital services. Unnamed US officials that European media have quoted have suggested the tariffs could be lessened or removed if negotiations advance in the next few weeks. However, it is unclear if President Trump is willing to lessen the tariff burden as August 1 approaches faster.

According to a Bloomberg survey of economists, the core Consumer Price Index (CPI)—which excludes food and energy—rose 0.3% last month, marking the largest monthly gain since January. This follows a modest 0.1% increase in May. The annualized core inflation rate is expected to accelerate to 2.9%, its first pickup since the start of the year. While this suggests a slight pass-through of increased import duties, most economists anticipate inflation will gather steam over the coming months, despite retailers’ reluctance to burden consumers who are already tightening their wallets amid a cooling labor market. Fed holds firm as retail sales limp and tariff pressures linger Retail sales data due Thursday is projected to show only marginal growth in June, after two consecutive monthly declines. This will offer deeper insight into consumer behavior and help refine second-quarter GDP estimates. Though consumer spending has moderated, Federal Reserve officials remain cautious about cutting interest rates—their concern: persistent inflation risks tied to tariffs. The next policy meeting is scheduled for July 29-30. Economists at Bloomberg—including Estelle Ou, Stuart Paul, Eliza Winger, and Chris G. Collins—predict that inflation trends in June will mirror May’s: limited tariff-related price increases in goods, offset by continued weakness in services. Web-scraped data shows firmness in items like appliances and furniture, but softness in categories like airfares and used vehicles. Global inflation pulse quickens as central banks brace for tariff fallout Global markets are also waking up to changing inflation trends. In Canada, June inflation figures will be key before the Bank of Canada’s rate decision on July 30. And in China this week, there will be data on gross domestic product as well as retail sales and trade that should give some readings on the effect of American tariffs on its economy. In Japan, inflation is expected to fall to 3.3%, adding pressure on the central bank. There is expected to be no respite from stubbornly high inflation in the UK, keeping the pressure on policymakers even as wage growth cools. In other places, G20 finance ministers are gathering in South Africa at a time of intensifying trade standoffs and escalating global inflation danger. Wednesday could have marked a crucial deadline, ending Trump’s pause on the sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs announced in April. However, this week, he introduced a new round of tariffs, many set to take effect on August 1. Despite the escalation, most investors remain optimistic that the US will sidestep steeper tariff rates, with hopes that Washington will reach trade agreements in the coming weeks with key partners like Japan and South Korea, according to Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. “That’s what the market has built in,” Saglimbene said. “If we don’t get that, then I think there is probably some risk that we would see higher near-term volatility if the White House implements some of these aggressive tariff measures.” With tariff effects spreading through the global supply chains, inflation-growth data and central bank reactions will continue to get close attention in the back half of the year.

The 5th round of Mutuum Finance presale has already sold out over 65%. It is priced at $0.03 in phase 5 and the price will spike by 16.67% in the next phase. The amount raised so far is over the $12.1 million barrier with over 13100 unique token holders. Smart money is already moving in, and those watching for what to buy before July ends are locking in their positions now, before the next leg up. In addition, Cardano (ADA) continues to hold ground in long-term portfolios, offering stability amid the rising momentum of new coins. Mutuum Finance is stealing the spotlight this summer. Steady Gains Keep Cardano on Track At the current price of approximately $0.63, Cardano (ADA) is a steady price as it exhibits a strong trend after slightly dropping at the beginning of this month. Advances in the Cardano ecosystem have continued to increase, as the scaling solution Hydra continues to gain greater use to enhance its transactions and make the ability to write and develop easier. Another driver can be the next Cardano Summit, which is conducted in the middle of July, especially when some information about governance or scaling tools is presented. All in all, ADA remains an interesting investment opportunity to long-term investors interested in a well-planned, gradually developing blockchain with strong fundamentals, thus completing the portfolio of more risky bets on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Strong Investor Demand Drives Mutuum Finance Presale Growth More than $12.1 million has been raised and over 13100 investors have invested in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as presale 5 soars. This shows investor confidence in the project during its early stages is increasing. MUTM is priced at $0.03 before a 17% spike in phase 6. Smart investors are rushing to catch this lowest price. Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract Lending Protocol Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a double-sided lending platform that will serve active as well as passive users of DeFi. Users will receive passive income from lending their USDT through stable passive income-generating smart contract pools providing stable passive income in the project’s Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending system. Additionally, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model permits lenders and borrowers to be as active as they like when it comes to swapping as it does not require a third party. The trend is more prevalent among customers of less secure assets. CertiK-Audited with an Additional $50K Bug Bounty for Enhanced Security Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch a stablecoin that is pegged to the US dollar (USD) on the Ethereum network. Besides, the project is audited by CertiK with a 95.0 trust score. This type of audit provides evidence of the readiness of the platform to become reliable and be institutional-graded transparent. Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty. The bounty will be rewarded on the basis of four levels of severity: critical, major, minor and low. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) $100,000 Giveaway Mutuum Finance values its new investors and has launched a $100,000 giveaway that will give 10 lucky winners $10,000 MUTM as a gesture of gratitude for the investors’ initial trust in the project. The crypto market is good in the first half of 2025, the future of the crypto market thus far is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Having raised more than $12.1 million, having more than 13,100 token holders, and just 65% of the Phase 5 being sold out, it is obvious that the ball is already rolling. Investors who lock in now are getting the best entry price of the first stage because the next 16.67% in Phase 6 triggers. This will increase the price to the next joint in just $0.03 per token. Mutuum provides innovation and security with a dual-model DeFi lending system, a CertiK audit trust score of 95.0, and a following additional bug bounty of $50K dollars.

The filing , filed to recover 40,350 USDT (a stablecoin pegged to the value of the US dollar) that crypto company Tether is currently holding in frozen accounts, refers to the victims only as “Ivan” and “Mouna.” But coverage from crypto outlet NOTUS suggests they are Ivan Soto-Wright, co-founder and chief executive of MoonPay, and Mouna Ammari Siala, the company’s chief financial officer. The DOJ says that the two executives were scammed into moving funds to an account controlled by an individual they believed was Steve Witkoff, a high-profile US real estate developer and co-chair of President Donald Trump’s 2017 inaugural committee. Blockchain data analysis indicates that the USDT was transferred to a wallet associated with Binance. The wallet is associated with Ehiremen Aigbokhan, a Nigerian citizen residing in Lagos. The episode represents an unusual public case in which senior industry players, who had access to advanced crypto tools and security protocols, proved to be as susceptible to what investigators call a fairly simple form of social engineering as the average rank-and-file email user. Scammer employed ‘insulting typo’ to imitate a public figure Unlike other crypto-crimes that rely on hacking or exploiting blockchain vulnerabilities (and perhaps for that reason alone), this scam was executed through deception through discreet email manipulation. The scammers employed bogus email addresses nearly identical to correct ones — substituting a capital “I” for a lowercase “l” in domain names — to deceive their targets. In this situation, emails were sent from steve_witkoff@t47lnaugural.com and financersvp@t47lnaugural.com — addresses spoofing the names of well-known people and events. This practice, called typosquatting, is used frequently in phishing scams and has proven effective at scamming even professionals who are security aware. “IP geolocation data consistently showed emails from these accounts originating from Nigeria, and not the United States,” the DOJ filing says. According to the authorities, Aigbokhan likely obtained the USDT due to a scam involving an international money transfer in the US. The con artists didn’t have to hack into or exploit the blockchain in any way; they only needed a ruse and a convincing pitch to steal the funds. Wallet activity raises further doubts about MoonPay The filing noted that one of the wallets involved in the scam is a marked MoonPay wallet on Etherscan, suggesting that the individuals affected are likely Ivan Soto-Wright and Mouna Ammari Siala. As of press time, MoonPay has not yet publicly replied to requests for comment from multiple outlets, including The Block and NOTUS . The timing of the case is particularly delicate. And in the latest expansion, MoonPay, a popular payment infrastructure for cryptocurrency purchases, made its services available in only a few US states. Still, last month, the NYDFS granted it a BitLicense, which has the consequence of allowing the company to operate in all 50 United States. It is one of the most difficult-to-obtain crypto regulatory licenses in the US and vital for doing business in the financial capital. The incident may raise additional questions about MoonPay’s internal security controls , vetting processes, and executive oversight, particularly if the victims in this case had indeed used the official company wallets to conduct what seem to be personal or poorly vetted transactions. Amid the boom in crypto adoption, the case is a sobering reminder that no one is immune to digital fraud, not even the executives of companies that help build the infrastructure of the crypto economy.

Celestia’s 16% surge in one day has sparked new momentum, while Solana is drawing attention through a stablecoin trial with Japan’s Minna Bank. These moves show how fast sentiment can shift when strong fundamentals back the action. At the same time, BlockDAG is turning heads with a different approach. It’s entering the world of professional sports through new deals with the Seattle Seawolves and Seattle Orcas. Adding to the excitement, BlockDAG has launched a GLOBAL LAUNCH release, offering a discounted $0.0016 entry until August 11, an offer far below its Batch 29 rate of $0.0276. Celestia Recovery Signals Upside Celestia’s TIA spiked 16% within 24 hours after dropping 26% in the previous days. The quick rebound shows that buyers are stepping back in, even as over $2.9 million in spot selling was recorded. Analysts suggest the move wasn’t fear-based selling, but likely profit-taking. Currently, about 78% of TIA holders remain optimistic about future gains. The token is trading close to its upper Bollinger Band at $1.89, a zone analysts identify as an important resistance. Strong interest in derivatives also backs the price movement. If the momentum stays strong, the next ceiling could come into play soon. SOL Tests Stablecoin in Japan Solana is making new strides with a stablecoin experiment led by Minna Bank and Fireblocks. The project explores how Solana’s network, both public and permissioned, can support digital money transfers and settlements within traditional banking systems. This pilot is seen as an important step in proving blockchain’s place in real finance. By using Solana’s tech, Minna Bank wants to create a more efficient system for yen-based stablecoin activity. If results are positive, Solana could see broader usage in Japan’s digital currency space. This adds weight to the current SOL market analysis that points to long-term potential in regulated environments. BlockDAG Scores Big With Seattle Sports Deals BlockDAG is stepping into the spotlight, not just with its presale, but by going all-in on sports to bring blockchain into the mainstream. The platform has signed with the Seattle Seawolves, champions in Major League Rugby, becoming their Official Blockchain Partner. This partnership includes co-branded media, exclusive fan coins, and behind-the-scenes content aimed at deepening fan interaction. That’s not all. BlockDAG has also teamed up with the Seattle Orcas from Major League Cricket, expanding its reach to a global fanbase. Through this partnership, cricket followers will get player-focused digital content and blockchain-driven tools that connect them more closely with the game. These deals aren’t just for show; they’re helping build real engagement and pushing BlockDAG to a wider audience. BlockDAG is currently in Batch 29 with a coin price of $0.0276. But under the GLOBAL LAUNCH release, users can grab a special rate of $0.0016 until August 11. This discounted price could deliver a 3,025% return at the $0.05 launch price. So far, BlockDAG has raised $336 million and sold 23.8 billion coins. With momentum building fast, the project is setting itself apart from typical presales by combining tech with real-world presence. Looking Ahead Celestia is bouncing back fast with a 16% surge, showing how quickly confidence can return. Solana’s move into stablecoin testing with Minna Bank opens doors to financial system adoption, hinting at broader support ahead. But it’s BlockDAG that’s drawing fresh interest with a mix of sports visibility and a limited-time offer. The $0.0016 GLOBAL LAUNCH release price is available until August 11. This, along with its growing presence in rugby and cricket, makes it one of the top crypto projects catching attention this season.

With so many updates hitting the market, today’s developments could help narrow the search. A new Hedera (HBAR) price signal is drawing interest, with RSI divergence forming near a key resistance level, suggesting a potential breakout. Similarly, the SEI short-term analysis points to a possible rally as chart patterns develop on multiple timeframes. In the presale market, BlockDAG (BDAG) has announced a fresh sports partnership with the Seattle Seawolves, a major step toward mainstream presence. With over $336 million raised so far, this announcement is expected to fuel even more interest in one of the largest crypto presales to date. So, which of these projects offers the best chance for upside in the coming year? Let’s break it down. Hedera (HBAR) Price Signal Hints at a Breakout Ahead HBAR is currently positioned just under a long-standing trendline from March, trading near the $0.162 resistance mark. This level has been tested three times in recent days, but hasn’t broken yet. However, there’s reason to stay alert, RSI is forming higher lows while the price remains steady or slightly lower since mid-June. This pattern of divergence is an important Hedera (HBAR) price signal, often signaling a potential price breakout. If HBAR moves above $0.162, analysts point to $0.178 and $0.217 as the next targets. On the other hand, if resistance holds again, the price could revisit $0.143, a lower support zone and another key area to monitor. SEI Short-Term Analysis Signals a Rally Setup The SEI short-term analysis reveals signs of a rally building. On the weekly chart, SEI is holding above long-term support and approaching the $0.28 resistance line. If the price can break through, it may pave the way for a jump to $1.00, a potential 288% gain from current levels. Zooming in, SEI’s 4-hour chart displays a descending triangle forming between the $0.245 and $0.250 support range. This setup often leads to a breakout. If SEI moves past $0.28, a quick push to $0.3475, about a 30% rise, becomes a realistic short-term target. BlockDAG Teams Up with Seattle Seawolves to Expand Reach in Sports BlockDAG has taken another major step by becoming the official blockchain partner of the Seattle Seawolves, one of the standout teams in Major League Rugby. This isn’t just about marketing; fans will get hands-on with blockchain content like digital collectibles and tradable tokens. The partnership also includes a co-branded content series on the Seawolves’ social media, featuring match highlights, player insights, and behind-the-scenes access powered by BlockDAG. This move helps bridge Web3 technology with real-world audiences. The BlockDAG presale has already raised over $336 million, selling more than 23.8 billion coins. This new partnership is expected to further drive visibility, helping the project inch closer to its $600 million presale goal. Market watchers say the coin could hit $1 after launch, putting it firmly in the top bullish crypto category. Right now, Batch 29 is open with the BDAG price at a special $0.0016. This price remains locked until the upcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. With a confirmed launch price of $0.05, that’s a potential return of 3,025% for those who buy in now. Following the Seawolves announcement, interest in Batch 29 has surged, and available supply is quickly shrinking. This could be the final opportunity to join before prices move up. Which Project Looks Like the Top Bullish Crypto for 2025? The recent Hedera (HBAR) price signal shows a breakout might be coming soon, with strong RSI divergence and clear targets ahead. SEI’s technicals are also setting up well, and the SEI short-term analysis points to a possible quick jump if resistance breaks at $0.28. But among all three, BlockDAG stands out as the top bullish crypto to watch. Its partnership with the Seattle Seawolves proves it’s not just talk, it’s delivering real adoption and expanding its reach. Add in the $336 million raised, growing mining community, and the 3,025% ROI locked in for presale buyers, and BlockDAG looks well-positioned for explosive growth. The current $0.0016 price won’t be available for long. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release set for August 11, this may be the last window to secure one of the highest-ROI opportunities of 2025.

Equity-heavy compensation structures are driving up totals and drawing increasing shareholder resistance, according to new findings from VanEck. Miner CEOs Outpace Tech and Energy Peers Across eight miners that VanEck reviewed – Bit Digital, Cipher Mining, CleanSpark, Core Scientific, Hut 8, Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms, and TeraWulf – executive pay averaged $14.4 million in 2024. This is more than double the previous year’s $6.6 million, and significantly above averages in the energy and technology sectors. Such a surge has occurred even as base salaries for mining executives remain broadly in line with other industries, averaging $474,000 in 2023. The primary driver is the sector’s reliance on stock-based compensation, which accounted for 89% of miner executive pay in 2024, compared to lower allocations in comparable sectors. While stock-based incentives can align management with investors, VanEck’s analysis indicates many miners continue to structure these awards with short- to medium-term vesting, limited performance gating, and dilution risks that erode shareholder value. Shareholders appear to be pushing back. Across broader corporate America, nearly 99% of executive pay proposals passed during the 2024 proxy season, while S&P 500 and Russell 3000 companies typically witness 90% or higher support rates. By contrast, Bitcoin miners saw an average support rate of just 64%. Six of the eight miners, including Riot, Core Scientific, Hut 8, Cipher, TeraWulf, and Marathon, have expanded the use of performance stock units (PSUs). These typically vest over multiple years, tied to share price or total shareholder return benchmarks. Marathon has transitioned fully to PSUs in 2025, and Cipher now uses a 50/50 split between restricted stock units and PSUs. Core Scientific reintroduced its long-term incentive plan with performance-linked stock after reorganization. These changes indicate a move away from purely time-based vesting and toward longer-term alignment, although not all firms have fully adopted these practices. CleanSpark, for one, has not implemented PSUs. The same is true for Bit Digital as well. Despite authorizing them, it has yet to issue them according to its latest filings. Pay-for-Performance Misalignment The question of whether these pay structures are delivering value remains. VanEck’s comparison of total executive pay with each miner’s 2024 market-cap growth shows stark contrasts. At TeraWulf and Core Scientific, executive pay amounted to around 2% of the firms’ market-cap increases. This pointed to relatively efficient pay-for-performance alignment. On the other hand, Riot’s executives received $230 million, which is equivalent to 73% of the company’s 2024 market-cap gains, while Marathon’s executive pay was 18% of its market-cap growth. Such disparities have drawn scrutiny, particularly given Riot’s history of shareholder pushback on pay proposals and concerns over dilution tied to expanding equity compensation plans.

This is the rocket company’s first known investment in xAI and one of its biggest investments in any outside company. Elon has been using his businesses to fuel xAI’s growth since the company launched. Earlier this year, he combined xAI with X, the platform previously known as Twitter. That merger turned a small AI lab into a larger company that could use the reach of a major social platform to push its products. The newly merged company was valued at $113 billion. Grok launches new version while xAI faces backlash Elon has been focusing on training Grok, xAI’s chatbot, which just rolled out its latest version, Grok 4. He called it “the smartest AI in the world” during the launch, after it earned top marks from benchmarking group Artificial Analysis. But the rollout hasn’t been smooth. Grok made headlines for posting racist and offensive responses to users on X. In a public apology, xAI said, “We deeply apologize for the horrific behavior that many experienced,” and added that the issue had been investigated and actions were taken to address it. Despite that, Elon is moving forward. During the same launch, he revealed plans to embed Grok into Tesla’s humanoid robots, Optimus. He didn’t give a timeline, but the goal is to make Grok the AI system that runs the robots. Grok is already being used in one of Elon’s other companies. It powers customer service features for Starlink, the satellite internet service run by SpaceX, as reported by The Wall Street Journal . According to investors who spoke with Elon’s team, more collaborations between SpaceX and xAI are expected. SpaceX takes on new risks while xAI burns cash This isn’t the first time Elon has tapped SpaceX to support another company he owns. Years ago, he borrowed $20 million from SpaceX to help fund Tesla. He also used SpaceX equipment to launch The Boring Company. In 2022, around the time he bought Twitter, he took out a $1 billion loan from SpaceX, which he later repaid. The $2 billion investment comes at a time when SpaceX is already pouring money into the development of its new rocket, Starship. The project is behind schedule and has hit multiple roadblocks this year, including three failed test flights and an engine test that ended in a major explosion. Still, the company had over $3 billion in cash on hand recently, according to The Wall Street Journal . SpaceX rarely backs outside companies. One of the few times it did was in 2021, when it bought a satellite communications firm for $524 million. This xAI deal is on a much larger scale, and it ties the rocket firm more deeply into Elon’s AI ambitions, just as the AI industry becomes more competitive and expensive. xAI is burning through billions to train models, just like other startups in the field. The company raised $5 billion in debt alongside its equity fundraising. One of the investors told the Journal that even more fundraising is expected later this year. Elon left his White House advisory role under Trump’s administration after their breakup and has seemingly moved his focus fully to building up xAI. While the company has attracted big valuation numbers, it still faces pressure from better-known rivals and a need for constant capital.

Bitcoin was trading at $118,000, while some altcoins like Bonk, Alpaca Finance (ALPACA), Kyber Network Crystal (KNC), and Phoenix (PHB) surged by double digits. Bonk price prediction Bonk, the biggest Solana meme coin, has done well in the past few days, moving from a low of $0.000011 to the current $0.00002590, its highest level since May 12. This surge happened in a high-volume environment, with its daily volume soaring to over $1.2 billion, higher than Trump Coin, Pugy Penguins, and Fartcoin, combined. Bonk price has moved above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) and the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level at $0.00002080. The MACD indicator and other oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) have all pointed upwards. Therefore, the token will likely keep rising as bulls target the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level at $0.00003440. A drop below the support at $0.00002080, the 23.6% retracement level will invalidate the bullish Bonk price forecast. Bonk price chart | Source: TradingView Alpaca Finance price forecast One notable thing that happens during a crypto bull run is that some small altcoins jump sharply for no reason. One of those that did that was Alpaca Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) product for leveraged products. Alpaca Finance is a crypto project offering leveraged yield farming products. It helps lenders earn safe and stable yields and offers undercollateralized loans for leveraged yield farming positions. Alpaca Finance recently announced that it would shut down its platform following the delisting from Binance. Alpaca Finance 🦙δ0 @AlpacaFinance · Follow After extensive internal deliberation and a thorough evaluation of possible paths forward, we have made the incredibly difficult decision to begin sunsetting Alpaca Finance and all of its products. This choice wasn’t made lightly, but we believe it is the most responsible course 5:42 PM · May 26, 2025 381 Reply Copy link Read 249 replies The daily chart shows that the ALPACA price bottomed at $0.0138 this year, and then rebounded to $0.084. This surge was likely because of the Wyckoff Theory, in which it has now moved into the markup phase. The MACD indicator is about to do a bullish crossover, while the Relative Strength Index has moved to the overbought level. Therefore, the ALPACA price will likely resume the downtrend as the network’s final days arrive. Alpaca price chart | Source: TradingView Kyber Network Crystal price forecast Kyber Network is a platform that describes itself as the liquidity hub for crypto trading. It is a top player in decentralized finance that has handled over $20 billion in volume over time. Kyber Network recently launched KyberSwap Crosschain, a platform that enables swaps across multiple protocols. The daily chart shows that the KNC price went through a short-squeeze, surging from a low of $0.2684 on July 1 to $0.7686, its highest level since December 9. The surge happened after the token formed a falling wedge pattern, a popular bullish reversal pattern. This rally, which happened without any catalyst, will likely be short-lived, which may see it drop to the key support at $0.4265, its highest point on May 12.

At the same time, the Near Protocol (NEAR) price trend remains cautious, hovering near $2.00 as traders look for signals pointing toward a climb to $4.66 or more. Yet, what’s pulling the spotlight right now is BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles, a unique presale mechanic that has already pushed total funding beyond $337 million. Every day, 50 million BlockDAG (BDAG) coins are put on offer, and whatever remains unsold goes directly to the wallet with the highest daily purchase. With the price still frozen at $0.0016 and a 3,025% return on the table at launch, these Buyer Battles are setting BlockDAG apart as the best crypto to buy right now. DOGE Gains 6.6% as Traders Watch Key Level Dogecoin (DOGE) rose 6.6% on July 7 to hit $0.1743, fueled by large buys from whales and growing interest among retail participants. Still, the charts remain mixed. DOGE sits inside a descending wedge pattern, and while $0.13 support has held firm, it continues to be tested. Some analysts warn that a breakdown below this level could invite further losses. Yet, DOGE has a history of bouncing back from this exact range. One market watcher noted similarities to previous price cycles where strong rallies followed slow consolidation phases. If history repeats, the Dogecoin price prediction could target $3.40 by the end of 2025. Traders remain cautious, but many are watching for that familiar reversal setup to play out. NEAR Holds $2 as Traders Await Breakout NEAR is trading just under $2.10, and its recent slip toward $2.00 has triggered mixed reactions from traders. While it remains above key support at $1.80, short-term indicators are leaning bearish. Despite this, analysts remain confident in NEAR’s mid-term outlook, with projections pointing toward $4.66 by year-end. Looking further out, some forecasts even target a Near Protocol price of $22.22 by 2031, assuming adoption and network upgrades continue. On the daily chart, though, the token is still in a wait-and-watch phase, holding steady, testing boundaries, and yet to confirm any breakout move. If bulls defend current levels, a reversal could unfold. Until then, NEAR stays on the radar, but without firm direction. BlockDAG Buyer Battles Boost Presale Momentum BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles are reshaping how presales generate traction. Every 24 hours, 50 million BDAG coins are up for sale, and any unpurchased amount is rewarded to the top wallet of the day. This adds a layer of strategy and reward without extra cost, attracting both new and repeat participants. In one round, a buyer gained over a million BDAG simply by finishing at the top when the timer ran out. With the price locked at $0.0016 until August 11 and the launch price set at $0.05, the return potential stands at a massive 3,025%. These daily contests don’t just boost holdings, they also lower the average cost per coin. That’s why more and more people see BlockDAG as the best crypto to buy right now. Each contest resets at midnight UTC, creating fresh opportunities daily. As of now, over $337 million has been raised and 23.8 billion BDAG coins have been sold. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release coming up fast, Buyer Battles offer an extra edge, letting users stack more coins before pricing changes. While some remain on the sidelines, those actively participating are gaining traction day by day. Summing Up! DOGE holds its ground, though technicals suggest traders should stay cautious. NEAR is moving through a key price range, with big-picture targets in sight but no strong short-term signals yet. BlockDAG, however, is breaking ahead. With Buyer Battles bringing daily incentives and returns projected at 3,025%, it’s delivering value and excitement beyond the standard presale model. Still priced at $0.0016 and packed with rewards, BlockDAG is shaping up to be the best crypto to buy right now for those looking to grow their position before the official launch.

But that early move has now left officials in Hanoi and major manufacturers facing more confusion than clarity. Vietnam was one of only two countries to strike a last-minute agreement before the deadline, avoiding the initial 46% tariff threat. Trump publicly announced the new blanket rate at 20%. Still, no full agreement has been released, and neither side has explained the fine print, leaving businesses without answers just weeks ahead of an August 1 reset. Thanh Cong Garment, a key Vietnamese supplier for companies like Adidas, Columbia, and Calvin Klein, expected relief. Instead, it’s stuck in limbo. Company chair Tran Nhu Tung said there’s no certainty whether the 20% tariff will apply to all goods or increase for products made with Chinese materials. “For the products that [have] materials from China but manufactured in Vietnam, what is the tariff to export to the US? 20 per cent or 30 per cent or 35 per cent?” Tung asked . “We need to wait.” The issue is not hypothetical. Vietnam’s garment industry depends on China for about 70% of its raw materials, including zippers, cotton yarn, and elastic. Unclear transshipment clause triggers panic in factories A clause in the Trump deal threatens to apply a 40% tariff on “transshipped” goods. But no one has defined what transshipment means. The Vietnamese government hasn’t offered clarification, and the U.S. hasn’t released any details either. This has raised fears among manufacturers that goods containing Chinese components—even if legally assembled in Vietnam—will get hit with heavier tariffs. Rich McClellan, founder of RMAC Advisory, which advises both companies and Vietnam’s government, said, “There is a sigh of relief that at least we know what the answer is for Vietnam . . . but there is still quite a lot of uncertainty in the agreement that exists right now.” He called the transshipment clause “the most ambiguous and most potentially risky portion of this agreement.” Economist Michael Wan from MUFG said the impact of the 40% clause depends on how far the Trump administration takes its definition. If it targets blatant cases like fake “Made in Vietnam” labeling, the damage may be limited. But if it’s based on foreign material thresholds, then Vietnamese exports could take a serious hit. Vietnam’s manufacturing sector has been built around serving U.S. demand. Nearly one-third of all Vietnamese exports go to the U.S., and its 2024 trade surplus with America hit $123 billion, making it the third-largest behind China and Mexico. Now, that success is being viewed with suspicion in Washington, especially since almost one in three new manufacturing projects in Vietnam last year were funded by Chinese investors. Hanoi scrambles for clarity before August deadline Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh met with the U.S.-Asean Business Council in Hanoi on Friday to push for clearer terms. The group represents companies like Apple, Amazon, and Boeing. Pham asked the council to support Vietnam’s efforts to finalize a full agreement, lower the tariff rate, and prevent actions that damage trade relations. Trump’s public announcement caught Vietnamese leaders off guard. Pham said the countries had agreed on a framework but warned that detailed rates for specific products were still missing. He also asked U.S. companies to push the White House to recognize Vietnam as a market economy, which would help reduce pressure from trade defense tools. As of now, investors haven’t pulled back. Foreign direct investment in Vietnam rose almost 30% to $21.5 billion in the first half of the year. But U.S. retailers are already sounding alarms. Steve Greenspon, founder of Honey-Can-Do, said: “A 20 per cent tariff will result in higher prices and inflation on goods. This will certainly lead to reduced demand for goods, hurting American businesses and jobs.” Thanh Cong Garment has already seen a drop of 15–20% in U.S. orders for the third quarter, due to a shipping rush before the July deadline and the wait for clarification. Vietnam’s early move may have helped it avoid the worst threats from Washington—for now. But with no full text, no product list, and no guarantee of better terms than its neighbors, the final outcome is still unknown.

By 2028, $TRUMP could reach a maximum price of $46.44. In 2031, $TRUMP will range between $69.66 to $75.47. The Official Trump coin ($TRUMP) was launched on January 17, 2025, just three days before the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Following President Trump’s “newfound” crypto inclination, the $TRUMP meme coin was birthed. My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE! It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2025 The coin has a total supply of 1 Billion tokens, with an initial 200 million tokens unlocked at launch. Subsequent unlocks are scheduled over the next three (3) years. $Trump token unlock roadmap Trump’s “advocacy” for digital assets reforms boosted interest in $TRUMP in the first few days, driving it to an all-time high (ATH) of $75.35. Several other meme tokens, like the Official MELANIA coin, also rode the momentum. Despite the initial surge, Official Trump’s value has plunged to lower levels amidst shifting market sentiment and uproar around the legitimacy of a “President-owned Meme coin.” The price performance of Official Trump is down over 85% from its all-time high, raising questions among investors such as: How much will Trump coin be worth? Can Trump coin reach $100? This piece explores the Official trump price predictions for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Official Trump Token $TRUMP Price $9.62 Market Capitalization $1,924,722,828 Trading Volume $442,288,797 Circulating Supply 199.99M TRUMP All-time High $75.35 (January 19, 2025) All-time Low $1.21 (January 18, 2025) 24-h High $9.89 24-h Low $9.42 Official Trump technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 5.40% 14-Day RSI 53.72 50-Day SMA $10.30 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA No Data Official Trump Coin ($TRUMP) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown TRUMP’s $10.30 resistance remains critical. Higher lows pattern suggests accumulation phase with bullish potential. The 4-hour chart shows consolidation between $9.60-$9.80 with neutral momentum. Official Trump coin 1-day price analysis: $TRUMP consolidates below $10 after strong rally The daily chart for TRUMP/USDT as of July 13 shows the token in a consolidation phase after a sharp rally earlier this week. Price surged close to the $8.30 support zone, broke through multiple resistance levels, and tapped a high of $10.40 before facing rejection. Currently, $TRUMP is holding around $9.66, sitting within a short-term consolidation range between $9.37 and $9.99. This sideways movement suggests a cooling-off period after an aggressive upward momentum. The MACD remains in positive territory. Meanwhile, the OBV (On-Balance Volume) has flattened after rising steeply during the rally, signaling that although buying volume has slowed, distribution remains limited. TRUMP/USDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The brief dip in price appears to be driven primarily by profit-taking at key resistance levels like $9.99 and $10.27 rather than a fundamental shift in trend. As long as $TRUMP holds above $9.37, bulls remain in control. A breakout above $9.99 could open the door for another test of $10.27, and potentially new highs. However, if support at $9.37 breaks, the price could revisit $8.97 or even $8.30 for a deeper correction. Official Trump 4-hour price analysis: $TRUMP sees consolidation after parabolic rally failure The 4-hour chart displays a classic parabolic rally that peaked around $10.30 before encountering strong resistance, and is currently trading around $9.65. The price action shows a distinct three-phase pattern: an initial consolidation around $8.60, followed by an aggressive upward move that broke through the middle Bollinger band, and finally a sharp rejection from the $10.30 resistance level that has led to sideways consolidation between $9.60-$9.80. TRUMP/USDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The Bollinger Bands indicate the market is transitioning from an expansion phase back into contraction, suggesting volatility is decreasing after the recent spike. The Balance of Power oscillator at 0.50 shows neutral momentum, indicating neither buyers nor sellers are in clear control, which aligns with the current consolidation pattern and suggests the market is waiting for the next directional catalyst. $TRUMP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $9.72 SELL SMA 5 $9.60 BUY SMA 10 $9.09 BUY SMA 21 $9.05 BUY SMA 50 $9.96 SELL SMA 100 $10.65 SELL SMA 200 No Data No Data Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $9.63 BUY EMA 5 $9.52 BUY EMA 10 $9.30 BUY EMA 21 $9.28 BUY EMA 50 $9.91 SELL EMA 100 $11.88 SELL EMA 200 No Data No Data What to expect from $TRUMP price analysis TRUMP sits at a critical $10.30 resistance level that will determine the next major move, with a break above targeting $11.00-$11.50, while failure could trigger a retest of $8.30 support. Technical indicators suggest consolidation is likely, though the approaching MACD bullish crossover favors bulls. Is Official Trump a good investment? Meme coins like $TRUMP are volatile and driven by hype, not fundamentals. While they can offer big rewards, they come with high risk and uncertainty. If you’re making an investment decision on TRUMP coin, do your own research carefully and prepare for price swings. Why is $TRUMP down? $TRUMP plunged hard post‑launch, now rattling in a tight $9–11 consolidation as traders wait for new hype or a breakdown. With most tokens controlled by insiders, sentiment remains weak, and only fresh utility or momentum could revitalize it. Official Trump coin price history by Coingecko Will Official Trump reach $50 soon? The coin’s price momentum supports a move back up to $50 in the near future. $TRUMP coin already saw this price point in January; increased investor interest could result in a quick resurgence. Will Official Trump reach $100? Having touched a peak price of $75.35 and a market cap of $15 billion in its first few weeks, the $100 milestone might not be much of a hurdle to scale, provided $TRUMP can recapture the momentum it had in its earlier days. Will $TRUMP reach $1000? For $TRUMP to reach $1000, its market cap would need to jump massively to about $200 billion. This would require significant growth and demand, making it highly unlikely in the near future. Does Official Trump have a good long-term future? The long-term future of the Official Trump Coin is uncertain. While it has gained attention, peaked at $75, and generated significant revenue, its success will depend on crypto market trends, investor confidence, and how it navigates regulatory challenges.

Official TRUMP historic price sentiment Official Trump coin price history by Coingecko Official Trump coin was launched on January 17, 2025, just a few days before the US presidential inauguration. Briefly after launch, the euphoria of DJT’s inauguration drove the $TRUMP coin to an all-time high of $75.35. As expected, market players took profit, and the Official Trump coin lost momentum, hitting a low of $18.75 by February 1, a massive 75% drop in price. Further price declines followed, but $TRUMP showed some resilience, reaching a high of $24 by mid-February, albeit short-lived. The bears recaptured the market in the following months, and the Official Trump coin settled at lower prices – about $7 to $11 between March and April. $TRUMP hit a high of $16.28 by April ending but has since maintained an average price of about $11. At the time of writing, July 2025, the price of Official Trump coin is between $9.42 and $9.89.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION|BNB|ZRX,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-13 05:47:04

Huge week ahead — it’s Crypto Week in the House! GENIUS heads to the President’s desk. Clarity moves to the Senate. Time to make America the Crypto Capital of the World. 🇺🇸💥 — Bo Hines (@BoHines) July 11, 2025 For years, crypto companies have pressed for clear rules that suit their business models. They fought previous regulatory proposals they opposed and invested several million dollars in campaigning during the recent elections, hoping to shape a more pro-crypto Congress. If next week’s votes go as expected, those efforts could finally bear fruit. A bill for stablecoins could become law in weeks, while a market structure measure might reach the Oval by the end of 2025. Crypto week runs from July 14 through July 18 Legislators have dubbed the proceedings “ Crypto Week , ” which runs from July 14 through 18. The agenda centers on three bills: the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025 (often called the Clarity Act), the Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act, and the GENIUS ( Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins ) Act. Earlier, lawmakers had considered combining the GENIUS Act and Clarity Act, but they now appear ready to vote on each bill separately. The House Rules Committee will review and discuss each bill on Monday at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Observers say all bills are likely to pass with support from both parties. The Clarity Act sets out how various cryptocurrencies should be regulated by agencies like the SEC and the CFTC. It sailed through the House Agriculture Committee by 47–6 and passed the Financial Services Committee by 32–19, signaling broad backing. The GENIUS Act establishes a stablecoin framework. The Senate already approved it, so House passage would send it directly to the president, making it the first big law on crypto to be written in the books. This act could head to President Trump’s desk by Friday, July 18, or the following Monday, though that timeline depends entirely on the House vote. The Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act prohibits the United States from creating or issuing a central bank digital currency. A separate version of the bill was passed by the House in 2024. What does it mean for stablecoins? If these bills become law, it would be an overall positive sign for stablecoins and the crypto industry. Still, it could take months or even years for lawmakers to draft detailed rules and for businesses to adapt. A recent Moody’s Ratings report warned that while the GENIUS Act could have a significant impact on the banks, stablecoins must offer real advantages over existing payment systems before gaining broad use. Moody’s added that without incentives from issuers, widespread adoption is unlikely. Some Democrats have voiced worries that these measures could open the door to ethical conflicts. Representative Stephen Lynch and Maxine Waters pointed to President Trump’s crypto dealings as a potential conflict of interest. Waters said in a statement: “These bills serve as a brazen stamp of approval for the blatant abuse of power we’re witnessing in real time.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",Regulation|USDC|USDT,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|USDC|USDT|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-13 05:50:02

Meanwhile, institutional interest has surged, particularly in the form of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw more than $1 billion in inflows on both Thursday and Friday — a back-to-back milestone never previously achieved. Institutional Surge Behind Latest Price Move Bitwise head of research André Dragosch observed in a Friday post that although Bitcoin is soaring, mainstream interest has yet to catch up. “Bitcoin is at new all-time highs but retail is almost nowhere to be found,” he wrote, referencing data showing weak Google search trends for the term “Bitcoin.” This suggests the current rally is primarily fueled by institutions, not individual investors. Search Trends Fail to Reflect Price Surge Google Trends data supports this narrative. Between June 29–July 5 and July 6–12, global searches for “Bitcoin” increased by just 8%, even as Bitcoin’s price broke past its previous all-time high of $111,970 and continued climbing to $118,780 by Friday. This subdued retail interest contrasts sharply with the surge seen in November 2024, when search interest peaked following Donald Trump’s election win. At that time, retail engagement helped propel Bitcoin past the $100,000 mark for the first time. Retail Sentiment: “Missed the Boat” Some crypto commentators believe that retail investors are sitting out because they feel priced out of the market. “I think a lot of retail folks find out the price of one Bitcoin is 117k and think, nahhh I missed the boat and don’t even give it a second thought,” said Bitcoin analyst Lindsay Stamp. Cedric Youngelman, host of the Bitcoin Matrix podcast, shared a similar sentiment, asking his followers, “At what Bitcoin price do you think retail wakes up? I’ll go first. I don’t think they’re coming for a long time.” Analysts Say Rally Still Has Momentum Despite low retail participation, market experts believe the current rally has more room to run. Bitcoin on-chain analyst Willy Woo commented, “This run has plenty of legs left in it.” The continued interest from institutional players suggests that Bitcoin’s momentum is far from over. Spot ETFs Remain the Main Driver Spot Bitcoin ETFs had an exceptionally strong week, pulling in a total of $2.72 billion over five trading days, according to Farside data. This wave of capital suggests institutional demand remains robust. However, the trend has raised questions about how to measure actual retail interest in the current market landscape. Cointelegraph recently noted that if the ultimate holders of Bitcoin ETF shares are retail investors, then interpreting on-chain data could become more complex. Conclusion While Bitcoin continues to scale new heights, the retail crowd appears hesitant to reenter the market. Whether due to price anxiety or market fatigue, their absence is notable — especially in contrast to the flood of institutional capital pouring into ETFs. As the rally unfolds, attention now turns to whether retail investors will follow — or continue to watch from the sidelines.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-07-13 05:51:50

In a post shared on X, Marks presented a chart suggesting that XRP may be on the verge of replicating a historical breakout pattern. XRP is Repeating Historical Patterns The chart highlights XRP’s price action over the past decade, with two notable consolidation phases similar to symmetrical triangle patterns . The first phase, spanning from 2014 to 2017, preceded a rapid move that took XRP to its all-time high of $3.84. According to Marks’ chart, the current consolidation, which began after XRP’s 2018 peak, reached its apex in late 2024 and recently resolved in an upward direction. $XRP 's history still points to the next leg up leading into $9.631+, if not WELL beyond! That's another +251% from here… pic.twitter.com/xS0hU635Dq — JAVON MARKS (@JavonTM1) July 11, 2025 Fibonacci Levels Signal Higher Targets Marks identified Fibonacci extension levels as key markers in the chart. The initial breakout in 2017 saw XRP consolidate briefly at the Fib. 1 extension level. Following this phase, it climbed to the 1.618 extension, before eventually exceeding the 2.618 level. The latest formation shows similar behavior as XRP has been consolidating above $1.99 (Fib. 1) for months. The chart shows the upcoming Fibonacci levels, with Marks noting the 1.618 target at approximately $9.631 and a 2.618 extension suggesting a potential move toward $123.5278. In his post, Marks stated that “history still points to the next leg up leading into $9.631+, if not well beyond,” describing this as a potential gain of 251% from current prices. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 At the time of his analysis, XRP traded at $2.58. Although $123.5278 is a lofty target, other well-known experts have shared triple-digit XRP targets , and historical trends and proper technical analysis back Marks’ analysis. Potential Implications for XRP’s Future Marks’ also highlights multiple support touches during consolidation, signaling a strengthening base before the recent breakout. The targets reflect a highly optimistic scenario for the digital asset, but align perfectly with its 2017 performance. While the analysis does not offer a specific timeline for reaching these targets, it positions XRP’s current market structure as a potential precursor to significant gains. Following the 2017 pattern could lead to substantial gains for XRP holders, and the technical setup presented provides a clear framework for understanding the asset’s next steps.

She was boxed out of it. That’s the view now flooding the ad world after the former NBCUniversal executive announced her exit from X, Elon Musk’s messy social platform. Her departure was no surprise to anyone still paying attention, because the truth is, she was never meant to succeed in the first place. According to the Financial Times , the warning signs were there from the very beginning, long before Elon merged X with his AI company, xAI, and long before Linda said in public that she was still CEO, which turned out to be false. She got the top job in 2023 with one goal: bring advertisers back to a platform Elon had turned radioactive. His “go fuck yourself” message to brands that pulled their spending after his $44 billion takeover was still echoing. Linda had the contacts, the polish, and the track record to try. But she never had the power. She was tasked with cleaning up a mess created by someone who wasn’t going to let her actually run anything. Elon stripped her power behind the scenes From the start, Elon micromanaged decisions, especially in advertising, which was supposed to be Linda’s turf. Brian Wieser of Madison & Wall said once Elon folded X into xAI for $45 billion, Linda had to ask herself why she was still showing up to work. By then, Elon was making solo calls, like banning hashtags in ads, changing how pricing worked, and appointing Nikita Bier as head of product without consulting her. She was publicly saying things were normal. In an interview at the Cannes ad festival three weeks before she quit, Linda claimed, “I’m the CEO of X and my boss remains the same.” But insiders allegedly told the Financial Times her title meant nothing by then. “Elon calls all the shots,” said one executive familiar with the situation. Others said she never managed to build the working chemistry Elon wanted. “Sheryl found the rhythm with Mark,” one person explained. “Linda couldn’t find the rhythm with Elon.” Things got worse when Elon brought in longtime lieutenant Steve Davis to tear through X’s finances, then brought on Mahmoud Reza Banki as CFO. Banki didn’t report to Linda, he dealt directly with Elon. People familiar with the company said Linda and Banki clashed hard. She wanted funds for creator payouts and better ad tech. Banki wanted to cut spending and reroute investment elsewhere. She was out of the loop in her own department. Ad wins came with lawsuits, not loyalty To fix X’s revenue problem, Linda took a scorched-earth approach. She hauled big brands like Shell and Pinterest into court, accusing them of illegally boycotting X. She also sued their trade group. Brian Wieser said brands only returned “to avoid an X legal challenge.” Even the ones who came back didn’t want to be there. “She did it with a gun,” said one longtime ad executive. Still, she landed deals with Google, Dell, Apple, Temu, Amazon , and Verizon. Research firm Emarketer said X will hit $2.3 billion in revenue this year, up from $1.9 billion. But that’s still a long drop from 2022’s $4.1 billion before Elon stepped in. Even outside of ads, Linda pushed ahead. She launched X Money, a peer-to-peer payment service expected later this year, boosted video content, and made creator deals. Those efforts got no runway once Elon re-entered the picture after months working with Trump in Washington. By then, his return meant her days were numbered. “Now that he’s back into his businesses, he was never going to put her to be the head of an AI company at all,” one person said. The lemon fallout exposed the real cracks In early 2024, Linda brokered a deal with Don Lemon for new content on X. But Elon canceled it after Lemon asked him in an interview whether he abused drugs. That fallout led to a lawsuit and worsened Linda’s already fragile standing. Staff described her as often tearful. She never spoke publicly against Elon. But privately, she thought he wasn’t focused enough on safety issues, which were high on her list. She quietly told close colleagues she was leaving. Around the same time, xAI’s chatbot Grok posted antisemitic content, which staff said wasn’t connected, but didn’t help the situation either. Neither X nor Linda commented, and Elon ignored questions about the exit. What comes next for Linda is uncertain. She’s a longtime Republican and close with Trump’s circle. She knows Ivanka Trump personally and has strong ties to Scott Turner and Tulsi Gabbard. Some think she’ll end up in the administration or as a “free speech” advocate — a direction she hinted at when she began wearing a diamond “Free Speech” necklace last year. Trump ally Mike Benz, now running a speech watchdog group, praised her on X: “She stepped up for all of us in the face of what seemed like insurmountable pressure.” Linda reposted it. Lou Paskalis, CEO of AJL Advisory, summed up her situation this way: “She doesn’t need to work, but she needs to go out in style. And I think that’s what’s next for her.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",Tech|X,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-13 06:10:36

The GBP/USD exchange rate dropped to a low of 1.3490, its lowest level since June 23. It has plunged by over 2.17% from its highest point this year. US Dollar Index rises The GBP/USD exchange rate has plunged in the past few days as the US Dollar Index (DXY) bounced back. Data shows that the DXY Index rose to $97.86 on Friday, up sharply from the year-to-date low of $96.35. The dollar index’s surge has coincided with the rebound of the US bond yields. Data shows that the ten-year yield jumped to 4.417%, its highest level since June 20, and much higher than this month’s low of 4.20%. The rally happened after the US published strong jobs numbers earlier this month. These numbers showed that the economy created over 147k jobs in June, higher than 144k in the previous month. Most notably, the data showed that the unemployment rate dropped to 4.1% from 4.3% previously. Following these reports, the odds that the Federal Reserve would slash interest rates this month plunged sharply. The next key catalyst for the GBP/USD exchange rate will be the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data on Wednesday. Economists expect the data to show that inflation rose modestly in June. They expect the report to show that prices of goods and services, excluding food and energy, rose 0.3% in June, the biggest jump in five months. Analysts also expect the data to show that the core CPI jumped to 2.9% in June. A strong inflation report will lower the chances of the Federal Reserve slashing interest rates in September, as many analysts anticipate. The US will publish the latest retail sales data on Thursday. Economists expect the data to reveal that retail sales rose modestly during the month. This is an important metric that will provide more color on the second quarter economic growth. UK inflation data The next important catalyst for the GBP/USD exchange rate will be the upcoming UK inflation data. Economists expect the report to show that the headline consumer price index (CPI) remained unchanged at 3.4%. The core consumer inflation report, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, is also expected to have remained unchanged at 3.5% during the month. The UK will also publish the latest retail sales data, which will also provide more information about the economy. Analysts expect that the BoE may hold interest rates steady in the upcoming meeting if inflation continues rising. GBP/USD technical analysis GBP/USD chart by TradingView The daily chart shows that the sterling pound has been in a strong bull run in the past few months, surging from a low of 1.2100 in January to a high of 1.3785 earlier this year. Most recently, the pair has formed an ascending channel and is now approaching its lower side. The pair has remained above the crucial support level at 1.3428, the upper side of the cup-and-handle pattern. Sterling remains above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). Therefore, the GBP/USD pair will likely drop and retest the upper side of the cup and then resume the uptrend.

The pattern was shared on X by Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a well-respected analyst in the XRP community, and it illustrates a shift in momentum following months of consolidation and a prolonged downtrend. The first bottom in this structure formed in mid-April 2025 when XRP dropped to approximately $1.65. After rebounding and failing to breach resistance around $2.6, the price retraced, reaching a second bottom near $1.9 in early June. This double dip established a firm support level and laid the groundwork for the current reversal setup. #XRP DOUBLE BOTTOM BREAKOUT! pic.twitter.com/DJ3sflq4RT — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) July 11, 2025 Following the second bottom, XRP began a strong ascent through late June and early July, eventually testing the neckline resistance at roughly $2.6. As shown in the chart, the most recent candle has now closed above this level, indicating a potential breakout . The move above this critical zone marks the first clear break of the neckline since the pattern began forming in March and may signal the beginning of a larger upward trend. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Structure and Targets The double bottom structure shared by Steph is well-defined. The asset tested a narrow support zone twice with minimal deviation, while the neckline at $2.6 remained a consistent ceiling throughout April to early July. With the breakout above that level now in place, the technical projection for this pattern points toward upside targets in the $3.4–$4 range, potentially hitting a new all-time high . These targets are derived by measuring the vertical distance from the base ($1.75) to the neckline ($2.6) and applying it above the breakout level. This method aligns with standard technical practice and is often used to estimate the potential scale of a reversal. Significance of the 3-Day Breakout The use of the 3-day timeframe adds to the significance of the pattern. Breakouts on higher timeframes are generally seen as more reliable than those on shorter intervals, as they reflect broader market positioning and reduced noise. In this case, the close above $2.6 suggests the potential for sustained bullish momentum, provided the level holds on a retest. A prominent analyst recently predicted that rising above $2.6 would send XRP to $3 . The asset is currently trading at $2.79, well above this resistance, and on its way to much higher levels. If XRP remains above this former resistance, the double bottom can be considered confirmed. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Although the platform completed the public sale in 12 minutes, there are some controversies surrounding it. Data from the Pump.fun token website shows that the launchpad raised $500 million during the sale. The platform sold 12.5% of the PUMP total supply for $0.0040 each in a public offering. Speculation Around Pump.fun ICO When announcing the ICO on July 9, Pump.fun said its native token will have a maximum supply of one trillion. 33% of the supply was to be sold at the ICO, 24% reserved for community and ecosystem initiatives, and 20% to the project’s team. The project allocated 13% to existing investors, and the rest in smaller percentages to the ecosystem fund, exchange liquidity, and live streaming. Out of the 33% allocated to the ICO, Pump.fun decided to keep 18% for a private sale to institutional buyers. The remaining 15%, accounting for 150 billion PUMP, will be offloaded in a public sale. However, data on the project’s website shows the team eventually offloaded only 12.5% of the supply in the public sale. At the time of writing, the firm has not published any update regarding the changes; hence, the community is speculating what could have happened to the remaining 2.5%. Tokens to be Tradeable in 72 Hours While the crypto community continues speculating, Pump.fun confirmed it has allocated the tokens kept for the private sale to their buyers. Users who participated in the public sale will receive their assets within the next 48-72 hours. However, they will not be tradable or transferable till the distribution phase is over. All ICO participants will be able to sell or transfer their PUMP allocations on the first day they become tradable. “We’d like to thank everyone who participated in the sale, whether on pump fun or on one of the participating exchanges, and we look forward to the very bright future of pump fun and the wider Solana ecosystem,” the platform stated . It is worth mentioning that Pump.fun faced a few challenges in the days leading up to the ICO. On July 8, the crypto exchange Gate.io abruptly removed its pre-market listing for PUMP and returned funds to all presale participants. The exchange eventually revealed that its decision stemmed from a discussion it had with the Pump.fun team. Notwithstanding the incident, PUMP ICO participants bought tokens worth $5 million on the exchange.

For now, it looks like the high-risk trader finally crashed out, as his personal X account has been deactivated. Searching for Wynn’s old username, “JamesWynnReal,” on X now returns an error message that says, “This account doesn’t exist.” Right before he deactivated his account, Wynn changed his profile description to “broke.” Wynn’s old X username returns an account error.

James Wynn( @JamesWynnReal ) has deactivated his X account! What happened? Did he blow up completely? All his wallets and Hyperliquid balance combined are down to just $10,176. https://t.co/FX6sISVWOh https://t.co/snkLcUUgXb pic.twitter.com/bkkxOpo7hZ — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 12, 2025 The trader was known for placing high-leverage bets that often ran opposite to the broader market. Due to this, Wynn received a lot of attention and scrutiny from fellow traders. His strategy relied on making high-leverage bets on Hyperliquid while enjoying the benefits of the resulting social media engagement. More often than not, the trader watched the market react opposite to his bet. Wynn lost hundreds of millions betting on BTC futures During May, Wynn’s position in BTC stood to lose roughly $100 million when Bitcoin’s price slipped below $105k. That triggered liquidations of 949 BTC, effectively erasing his long-BTC holdings. In a post he later removed, Wynn said, “I do not follow proper risk management, nor do I claim to be a professional; if anything, I claim to be lucky. I’m effectively gambling, and I stand to lose everything. I strongly advise people against what I’m doing.” Instead of slowing down, Wynn once again opened a $100 million bet days later. Wynn claimed that market makers were intentionally targeting his positions to force a liquidation. Seeking relief, he asked the community for help. Up to 24 unique wallet addresses sent donation funds to his account. Shortly after receiving those donations, Wynn sold 240 BTC to push down his liquidation price on his remaining positions. Still, the trader couldn’t save his position and ultimately lost over 99 percent of the second $100 million position. $198.68 million got liquidated from the broader crypto market in 24 hours Meanwhile, the broader crypto futures market saw massive liquidations over the last 24 hours. Liquidation data from CoinGlass at press time shows a total of $198.68 million wiped out in perpetual futures. Long positions accounted for $132.75 million of that total, while shorts made up $65.93 million. Ethereum traders felt the pinch as well, with $30.84 million in positions closed out. Of that, $21.14 million were longs and $9.26 million were shorts. XRP followed, tallying $16.89 million in liquidations, $13.27 million on the long side, and $3.62 million short.

Here’s the Next Target,https://timestabloid.com/last-time-this-happened-cardano-ada-surged-55-heres-the-next-target/,"A recent analysis by crypto market analyst Ali Martinez (@ali_charts) has raised interest in Cardano (ADA) after the digital asset revisited a historically significant price level. In a video posted on X, Martinez highlighted that Cardano has once again touched the $0.54 support level, a zone from which the asset previously surged 55%. His chart, which plots ADA’s 12-hour price action, suggests a similar rebound may now be underway. The chart shows a well-defined parallel channel that ADA has followed over the past several weeks. The lower boundary of this channel, around $0.54, appears to be holding as strong support. After dipping to this level, Cardano has shown early signs of recovery, trading at approximately $0.6264 at the time of the analysis. The analyst indicated that “a buying spike here could send Cardano to $0.84 like it did in April.” Notably, a Times Tabloid report predicted this target for ADA in March , and Martinez suggests that the asset could mirror this trajectory. The last time this happened, Cardano $ADA surged 55%! pic.twitter.com/G2B9fqOHzX — Ali (@ali_charts) July 11, 2025 Parallel Channel Continues to Guide Price Action Martinez’s chart captures ADA’s recent volatility, with oscillation between defined support and resistance levels. The price pattern shows several sharp reversals and failed breakouts, reinforcing the relevance of the horizontal levels outlined on the graph. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to Martinez’s projection, ADA could first retest the $0.68 range, then break through intermediate resistance near $0.75 before reaching the upper boundary near $0.84. The structure implies a stair-step recovery pattern contingent on renewed market interest and volume. ADA is currently trading at $0.7162, up almost 25% from last week. The asset is now aiming for the next resistance level before the final target. Another analyst previously revealed that breaking above $0.7 could open the door for further gains , and the expected momentum could help the asset reach and potentially surpass $0.84. Market Sentiment May Dictate Follow-Through While the setup resembles past bullish recoveries, execution will depend on broader market sentiment and Cardano’s ability to sustain upward momentum. Additionally, ADA has multiple bullish indicators that support the positive outlook. The asset recently formed its first weekly golden cross and has seen notable whale activity that suggests a big move in its immediate future. Martinez’s recent breakdown places Cardano at a critical juncture, and with support from the community and increasing bullish sentiment, the $0.84 target may be within reach once again.

A popular crypto analyst with almost 140,000 followers on X believes this could be just the beginning and envisioned a further surge to and beyond $1 if ADA breaks through a key resistance level, which is being tested now. Cardano $ADA is breaking through a key resistance level, opening the door for a rally to $0.90–$1.20! pic.twitter.com/4dj8jQfJFN — Ali (@ali_charts) July 13, 2025 This important resistance that could hinder ADA’s progress is situated somewhere around $0.74, a level the asset is very familiar with, as it managed to contain its price ascent earlier this year. ADA managed to breach it briefly during the Friday price surge that drove it to a two-and-a-half-month high of almost $0.78, but the bears quickly regrouped and didn’t allow a decisive closure above it. In fact, the last time Cardano’s token traded sustainably above $0.74 was in mid-May. Since then, the asset underwent a substantial correction that drove it down to $0.5 at one point. Nevertheless, ADA is still the top performer on a weekly scale from the 12 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, having gained almost 30%. Thus, it has increased more than XRP (26%) and HYPE (22%). This impressive price surge comes just a few weeks after IOG proposed that the treasury would trade $100 million worth of ADA for BTC and stablecoins to enhance the blockchain’s DeFi ecosystem. The move met immediate resistance from some members, who claimed that it could lead to a more painful sell-off and price declines. Charles Hoskinson was quick to mock the naysayers after ADA surged past $0.7 and became a top performer. Remember when we were told that a 100 million dollar trade of ada would collapse the price? https://t.co/kYm5CKw97O pic.twitter.com/tPZiROv37i — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) July 11, 2025 The post ADA Is Breaking Out: Will Cardano Surge Past $1 Next? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",ADABTC|ADAUSD|Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Cardano (ADA) Price,EN,0,0,ADA|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-07-13 06:51:54

In a new interview with CNBC Television, Fold CEO Will Reeves says that the top crypto asset by market cap’s recent new all-time high was due to a combination of high institutional demand and low supply. “This is what happens when massive demand meets the finite supply of Bitcoin. And what we’re seeing right now is the supply shock in motion. So I’d certainly say what we are seeing is the fundamentals of Bitcoin in play… What we’ve seen recently with the rise of Bitcoin treasury companies, the ETFs (exchange-traded funds) is that entirely new classes of capital are able to invest in the asset. What we’re seeing is what happens when trillions of dollars start knocking on the door – the price tends to go up.” According to Reeves, the market’s appetite for BTC will cause its dominance levels to irreversibly rise – a trend that would leave countless altcoins competing for capital. “Frankly, I think [altcoins] will remain speculative. Bitcoin dominance is at 60% and rising. I think what we’re seeing is an inevitable trend towards the signal, the apex asset. The issue is that Bitcoin is the only credibly neutral digital asset that is in issuance. All the other tokens are still proving extraordinarily speculative use cases without the track record of Bitcoin. And so what we are seeing today is the continued march of Bitcoin dominating this entire market… Ultimately, what we’ve seen is something that can’t be reversed.” Bitcoin is trading for $117,613 at time of writing, a sideways move on the day. Meanwhile, Bitcoin dominance, which measures how much of the total crypto market cap belongs to BTC, stands at 64.58%.

Crypto pundit Jungle Inc (@jungleincxrp) highlighted these developments in a recent post on X, and this potential rally is underpinned by strengthening technical indicators, increasing institutional support, and a surge in interest surrounding RLUSD. XRP Traders Now Eyeing $6 XRP is holding strong above $2.34, with analysts targeting a breakout to $2.65 — and possibly $4–$6 if key levels flip. This comes as Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD just smashed through a $500M market cap, ranking among the top 20 stablecoins… pic.twitter.com/P80HTRU1y8 — Jungle Inc Crypto News (@jungleincxrp) July 11, 2025 Accumulation Patterns and Whale Activity Support Bullish Outlook Over the past few months, XRP has shown signs of prolonged accumulation , according to analysts observing historical price consolidation. The asset has formed both a symmetrical triangle and a bull flag pattern , which are typically associated with impending upward movement. At the same time, tightening volatility bands and rising open interest in XRP derivatives suggest that a breakout move may be approaching. Market watchers also note steady whale accumulation , signaling strong confidence from large-scale holders. RLUSD’s Adoption Shows Institutional Backing The broader environment surrounding Ripple has also shifted. RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin, has now surpassed a $500 million market cap, placing it among the top 20 stablecoins globally. At press time, it was ranked #8, and with growing adoption, it could reach Ripple’s goal of joining the top 5 stablecoins before the end of 2025. RLUSD’s rapid adoption is also supported by significant institutional backing. Notably, BNY Mellon, one of the oldest custodians in the financial sector, is now providing custody solutions for RLUSD . Meanwhile, integrations with platforms like Transak and OpenPayd are expanding RLUSD’s utility in cross-border and crypto-fiat payment flows.

Beyond chart patterns, derivatives data shows growing participation. Open interest in XRP futures and options has steadily climbed since Q2 2025, aligning with increased volume and capital inflow into XRP-related markets. XRP Target: The $4 to $6 Range XRP has broken above the $2.65 resistance level, and Jungle Inc expects it to keep rising. A move to the $4 to $6 range would represent a 45% to 117% increase from its current price of $2.76. What separates the current market cycle from previous ones is the infrastructure surrounding XRP. This target is feasible if momentum continues, particularly with growing institutional support and technical indicators favoring a sustained bullish trend.

As such, the crypto-linked investment products have witnessed a significant influx of capital in recent weeks. The Bitcoin ETFs, however, witnessed the inflow of an unprecedented amount of capital to close the past week. This significant investor activity came as the price of the premier cryptocurrency forged multiple new all-time highs in the space of a few days. Bitcoin ETFs Record $2.72 Billion In Past Week: Report According to the latest market data , the Bitcoin ETFs in the United States posted a total net inflow of $1.03 billion on Friday, July 11. This outstanding performance marked the second straight day of a 10-figure capital influx for the crypto-based investment vehicles. Unsurprisingly, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (with the ticker IBIT) witnessed the largest net inflow, adding $953.52 million in value to close the week. This strong performance emphasizes the asset manager’s growing dominance in the crypto ETFs industry — as IBIT also recently became the fastest ETF to hit $80 billion in assets under management. ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) came in second place, registering a net inflow of $23.51 million on Friday. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) and VanEck’s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (HODL) also managed to post eight-figure inflows, with $20.93 million and $20.01 million, respectively. Bitwise’s Bitcoin ETF (BITB) and Invesco’s fund (BTCO) were the only other funds to record positive inflows to close the week. BITB and BTCO posted $6.41 million and $5.3 million, respectively, on the day. It is worth noting that the other Bitcoin ETFs didn’t witness any net activity. As earlier mentioned, the US Bitcoin ETFs registered over a billion-dollar net inflow for the second consecutive day — for the first time since launching in January 2024. These performances in the past two days pushed the weekly record to around $2.72 billion, the fifth-largest weekly inflow. Bitcoin Price Overview The direct relationship between the Bitcoin price and the US Bitcoin ETFs’ inflows continued in the past week. On both days when the funds witnessed a billion-dollar capital influx, the price of BTC experienced a significant price surge, reaching a new all-time high of around $118,700. As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin sits around $117,332, reflecting a 0.3% decline in the past 24 hours.

In the meantime, many altcoins have extended their gains, with XLM, HBAR, and BONK emerging as today’s top performers. BTC Stalls at $118K Recall that bitcoin’s price volatility had largely disappeared since the start of the month, as the asset was confined within a relatively tight range between $105,000 and $110,000. Following a few unsuccessful attempts for a breakout, though, came Wednesday evening when the bulls took full control of the market. During the first wave north, they pushed the cryptocurrency beyond $110,000 and all the way up to $112,000, which set a new all-time high. While bitcoin retraced slightly on the next day, its rally couldn’t be contained yet, and it shot up to $116,000 on Thursday. Friday saw another impressive leg up that drove the primary digital asset ot almost $119,000 , which became its latest all-time high. This meant that BTC had added over ten grand in less than 48 hours to set a new record. You can check some of the possible reasons behind this mindblowing surge here . Saturday saw little to no action, even though Trump slapped the EU and Mexico with 30% tariffs and warned there would be more if they responded. BTC slipped slightly to $117,500 but has managed to recover the losses and is back to $118,000 as of press time now. Its market cap remains close to $2.350 trillion, making bitcoin the sixth-largest global asset . BTCUSD. Source: TradingView These Alts Keep Rocking Most altcoins have stalled similar to BTC over the past day or so, but XLM and HBAR stand in a league of their own. The former has added another 17.5% in the past day, extending its weekly gains to over 85%. HBAR has surged by nearly 15% daily and almost 50% weekly, which has pushed its price well beyond $0.22. BONK completes the double-digit price pump club, with a 12% surge of its own. Other big gainers from the larger-cap alts include ALGO, IMX, and MNT, but their increases are noticeably smaller. The cumulative market cap of all crypto assets has gained around $20 billion overnight and is up to $3.760 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Despite President Trump’s trade war, BofA strategists including Savita Subramanian and Jill Carey Hall predict that the S&P 500 will hit 6,300 by the end of the year and skyrocket to 6,600 in 12 months, reports Bloomberg. BofA strategists say America’s economic engine remains resilient. “Despite tentative trade deals, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and receding recession risks, policy uncertainty is near all-time highs and sovereign yields are at multi-decade highs. But corporate transparency has remained intact… Volatility in currency, inflation and rates have failed to rattle S&P 500 margins since Covid – corporates either adapted or dropped out of the index.” BofA’s bullish stance comes as one wealth advisory firm says investors are becoming increasingly optimistic about the trajectory of the S&P 500. In a new CNBC interview, Payne Capital Management senior wealth advisor Courtney Garcia says tariff headlines are no longer rattling investor confidence, as markets grow accustomed to Trump’s threats being delayed or dialed back. “I think what the market is starting to realize is that these are just getting pushed down the line… There are no really tariff deadlines that are coming. They just keep getting pushed out indefinitely, and that’s where markets are saying, ‘Okay, this isn’t probably as bad as we expected,’ at least in the first week of April, which markets have already moved past. I think at this point, markets are more focused on almost a Goldilocks scenario, that interest rates are probably coming down later this year, growth is actually still strong, inflation is starting to come down. I think that’s what the market is pricing in.” Payne Capital Management is a New York-based registered investment advisor that oversees $1.06 billion in assets.

This breakout occurred after XRP held firm above the $2.08 level, which Egrag had earlier marked as a significant support point. The breakout signals a shift in price structure, suggesting increasing bullish momentum after several months of horizontal movement. The chart marks key zones that have defined XRP’s price trajectory over recent months, such as the Heavy Demand Zone between $1.60 and $2.08, the Range Support Zone slightly above this region, and the now-breached yellow Range Resistance Zone around $2.35. XRP Support Formation and Keep Warning According to the analyst, the primary focus going forward will be identifying where new support levels will form. Egrag emphasized that “the higher the support, the better,” underscoring the importance of maintaining newly gained price levels above previous resistance. This would indicate market strength and potential for continued upward movement. The tweet warns that while a breakout above the Heavy Supply Zone has occurred, it is important to remain cautious. Egrag notes that a “throwback”—a retest of previous resistance to confirm it as support—remains a possibility in the coming days. This would be a natural technical step in determining whether the breakout is sustainable. #XRP – Ranges & Key Zones #XRP has reached the ""Heavy Supply Zone"", now, the focus is on where support will form. The higher the support, the better! The best-case scenario? A strong blast through the ""Heavy Supply Zone"", launching us into the Valhalla Phase! … pic.twitter.com/EjBRZyF3J2 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) July 11, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Targeting the Valhalla Phase The most optimistic scenario described by Egrag is a continued surge beyond the green “Heavy Supply Zone,” culminating in what he termed the “Valhalla Phase.” On the chart, this zone lies above the $3.30 level, a price range not seen since XRP’s major peaks. If price action continues beyond this resistance area, it could indicate entry into a longer-term bullish phase for the asset. The use of the term “Valhalla Phase” represents a culmination of bullish sentiment, where the price breaks free from supply constraints and moves into price discovery. However, Egrag was careful to note that the journey into this phase is contingent upon current levels holding and further confirmation through price behavior early next week. At the time of the update, XRP was trading around $2.78, having posted significant intraday gains. The move took price above the long-standing resistance line that had kept XRP below key levels since the beginning of 2025. The move above the $2.35 zone is considered an important step in shifting the medium-term trend from neutral to bullish. The next few trading sessions will be pivotal in determining whether this upward move can be sustained, with a close watch on support levels and potential for a retest.

By 2028, DOGE may potentially achieve a peak price of $0.793921. By 2031, DOGE might touch $1.29 with an average trading price of $1.24. Propelled by a dedicated community of part-time developers and enthusiastic internet supporters, Dogecoin is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Despite relying on borrowed code due to limited resources, its popularity continues to soar, with tens of thousands of social media followers advocating for supply limitations. Having touched its ATH at $0.7376, will DOGE reach $1? Let’s get into the Dogecoin price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Dogecoin Token DOGE Price $ 0.199 (+1.01%) Market Cap $29.98B Trading Volume (24-hour) $1.44B Circulating Supply 150.07B DOGE All-time High $0.7376 May 07, 2021 All-time Low $0.00008547 May 07, 2015 24-hour High $0.2023 24-hour Low $0.1932 Dogecoin price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 6.17% 50-Day SMA 0.184575 14-Day RSI 62.82 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA 0.1778 Dogecoin price analysis: DOGE at $0.199 following a swift recovery TL;DR Breakdown : Dogecoin price analysis confirmed an uptrend as the price increased to $0.199. Cryptocurrency gains 1.01% of its value. DOGE coin faces resistance around $0.206. On July 13, 2025, Dogecoin price analysis revealed an increasing trend for the meme coin. The coin’s price recovered to $0.199 in the past 24 hours. From an overall observation, the currency gained 1.01 percent today. Support soon appeared when the coin dived to $0.197 yesterday, as buyers stepped in to provide support, and the price has now been increasing again, reaching $0.199. Dogecoin 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of Dogecoin confirmed a bullish trend in the market. The cryptocurrency’s value stepped up to $0.199 today. A green candlestick on the price chart signifies renewed buying activities. The coin shed some value yesterday, but now the bullish momentum seems to be ongoing once again. DOGE/USD 1-day Price Chart. Source: TradingView The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is expanding, leading to high volatility levels. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $0.200, whereas its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.145. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is trending in the upper neutral area. The indicator’s value has increased to 64.19 in the past 24 hours. The ascending curve on the RSI graph signifies rising bullish strength. If buying activities continue to accelerate, the RSI level might keep heading towards the overbought area. DOGE/USD 4-hour price analysis The four-hour price chart of Dogecoin also confirmed a bullish trend in the market. The DOGE/USD price has been facing decreasing volatility toward the $0.199 level on an hourly basis. The decreasing volatility signals a lower chance of a trend reversal and less price oscillation in the coming hours. However, buyers are still holding the DOGE price above $0.190. DOGE/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The Bollinger Bands are slowly converging, leading to decreasing volatility. This low volatility signifies lower market unpredictability. Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger band has shifted to $0.212, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band has moved to $0.178, showing the support point. The RSI indicator is trending upwards in the neutral region. Its value has increased to 60.59 in the past four hours. This situation hints at a dominance by the buyers, and further appreciation also seems possible, as the price has already fluctuated in both directions during the past few hours and has since settled on the upper side due to decreased volatility.

Dogecoin price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin’s value has increased to a high of $0.199 in the past 24 hours. If buyers maintain their momentum, DOGE’s price might trigger further gains and head toward $0.206. However, a lack of buying interest at the current levels might trigger some selling pressure, which could present slight losses for intraday traders. Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is highly volatile and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.463121 level by 2026. Why is DOGE up? DOGE’s price increased to $0.199 over the last 24 hours as bullish momentum continued around immediate support channels. Moreover, buyers are currently dominating the price action. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2025? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.2481 in 2025. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by March 2027. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support for this meme coin can push it to $1 by 2030. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 3,015.42 DOGE in July; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is trading below the year’s peak price of $0.414, which was observed on January 17, 2025, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.29 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial. Recent news/opinion on Dogecoin Bitwise Asset Management filed an amended S-1 registration for a Dogecoin ETF on June 26, 2025.

Our analysis shows that DOGE could cross $1.29 by 2031. Dogecoin historic price sentiment DOGE price history 2013 was the beginning of Dogecoin, and it surged to $0.0004 in the first days of trading. By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March’s bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February. In March, DOGE’s value decreased further as it dipped to the $0.20 range, and April saw the lowest DOGE price of $0.142. However, in May, the meme coin recovered back to the $0.249 mark, following some improvement. Near the start of July 2025, Dogecoin is trending near the $0.165 level.",Crypto Price Predictions|DOGE,EN,0,0,MINING|DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-13 08:40:39

The Dominant Answer May Surprise You,https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-or-xlm-we-asked-4-ais-who-wins-in-2025-the-dominant-answer-may-surprise-you/,"TL;DR It has been a big week for the cryptocurrency markets, with BTC rising to a new all-time high, and many altcoins posting substantial double-digit gains. Although XLM has wildly outperformed in terms of weekly gains and has beaten XRP so far, the year is far from over, and here’s what the top AIs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, and Perplexity) think about the battle between the two. XRP’s Case Continuing our recent trend of asking AIs about popular topics in the cryptocurrency community, we decided to see what the chatbots think about two of the hottest digital assets as of late. After all, XRP recently regained its third spot in terms of market cap after suring to a multi-month peak, while XLM skyrocketed by almost 90% weekly to hit its highest price since January. First, we will focus on Ripple’s native token and its case why it can win this year. According to ChatGPT, there are several factors that could propel it to victory. They include large partnerships similar to the ones it has already concluded recently, such as with big banks like SBI and Santander. In terms of adoption, ChatGPT believes the active usage of RippleNet’s On-Demand Liquidity protocol gives it a point ahead of the competition. Moreover, XRP is positioned as a bridge asset for cross-border payments at an institutional scale, which could also benefit its future price moves. The AI solution outlined the potential approval of spot XRP ETFs in the US as a sizeable advantage for Ripple’s token against Stellar’s XLM. It also believes XRP has a “stronger retail community and higher visibility” and has the most utilized ecosystem and technology department. Consequently, ChatGPT was very conclusive in its answer: Interestingly, the other three AIs agreed to a large extent with ChatGPT’s favoritism of XRP. “Given the current information and market sentiment, Ripple (XRP) appears to have a stronger potential for better performance in 2025 compared to Stellar (XLM),” answered Gemini. Grok said: “While both XLM and XRP have strong fundamentals and growth potential, XRP is poised to perform better in 2025 due to its larger market cap, institutional adoption, regulatory tailwinds, and stronger price momentum.” Perplexity noted: “Ripple (XRP) is favored to outperform Stellar (XLM) in 2025 due to its higher price targets, stronger institutional adoption, and more significant market catalysts.” Why Can’t XLM Win? Although they didn’t completely rule out XLM, the AIs were all pretty convinced that XRP would dominate this year. ChatGPT admitted that Stellar has not seen any legal cases, unlike Ripple, but has not received “explicit regulatory clarity” either, which is not really benefiting it. It added that XLM doesn’t have the same level of “institutional legal defense or presence” and lacks the depth or visibility of XRP. Moreover, the AI chatbot said XLM is “more focused on retail remittances and humanitarian aid,” which are practical but “smaller-scale use cases in terms of transaction volume.” Despite its most recent weekly surge , XLM is less than 40% up this year as it entered 2025 at approximately $0.32. It remains 50% away from its all-time high, which was set in January 2018. XRP’s YTD gains are similar (34%) as it went into the new year at $2.08 and is now just over $2.8. Interestingly, its ATH was also set in January 2018 at $3.4, but XRP managed to match it this year. Although it failed there, the asset is now just 17.5% away from breaking into uncharted territory. This, however, could be considered one of the few advantages XLM has over XRP, as it has more room for growth, which is visible this week. Still, the AIs didn’t give much chance for Stellar’s token to win in 2025. “Stellar (XLM) is likely to see steady growth but is not expected to match XRP’s performance unless it achieves a major breakthrough in adoption or technology,” said Perplexity.

With the price holding firm above $118,000 and many now eyeing the $125,000 level, this seems to carry serious weight. What makes this phase even more important is the surrounding environment. The possibility of Federal Reserve rate cuts combined with strong moves inside U.S. regulatory circles has set the stage for a market that could run higher for months. With America’s top officials speaking openly about advancing crypto’s future, it is no longer just traders who are excited, as institutional and policy attention has entered the conversation. For anyone looking at crypto now, it is becoming harder to ignore the potential in well-designed projects with true utility. Crypto Week, Federal Policy, and Why Crypto Looks Poised for Growth The U.S. is preparing for what may become a defining moment in the world of digital assets. Bo Hines, who leads the White House’s focus on crypto, recently made a headline-grabbing statement, saying it is time to make America the leader in this space. This comes as Bitcoin holds its rally, Ethereum pushes above $3,000, and all other top altcoins have also managed to make impressive weekly gains, reflecting strong confidence across the market. JUST IN: 🇺🇸 US Director of Digital Assets says ""huge week ahead… time to make America the crypto capital of the world."" — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) July 11, 2025 But price moves are only part of the story. Congress is about to examine key legislation, including the CLARITY Act and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, aimed at creating a clear legal structure for digital assets as well, during the period that has been officially termed by the entity as “ Crypto Week ”. At the same time, the Federal Reserve faces its own storm: reports suggest Chair Jerome Powell may soon step down, and many expect interest rate cuts as early as next month. This combination of regulatory progress and economic change is drawing attention from across the financial world. JUST NOW: The Chairman of the board of Fannie & Freddie says he is encouraged that Fed Chair Jerome Powell is considering to resign. We have no confirmed reports on Powell saying he’s considering this.Trump can’t fire him, but if Powell does leave on his own…Oh boy. pic.twitter.com/eh5MlwIN79 — amit (@amitisinvesting) July 11, 2025 For investors, this moment offers more than just a fast-moving market and presents a window to focus on cryptocurrencies and platforms with meaningful purpose and the tools to succeed. With momentum across price action, policy, and institutional involvement, this period stands out as one of the most promising for careful and forward-looking crypto investment.

According to the Bidhannagar police, the 26-year-old man from Ahmedabad was arrested for his role in the crypto investment fraud which took place in 2023. The defendant, Harshik Mukeshbhai Patel, was arrested at Chandkheda in Gandhinagar district in Gujarat. According to reports, on the order of the court, he has been transported to Kolkata, where he will be remanded. The arrest was made in connection with a case that was registered on September 15, 2023, at the Bidhannagar Cyber Crime Police Station based on a complaint filed by 34-year-old Aurobinda Maji, a resident of Kolkata. Indian police docks suspect for role in crypto investment scam According to the complaint filed by Maji, he was duped by the fake cryptocurrency investment platform that promised massive gains. The platform provided its users with a wallet where they could deposit funds and watch their investments grow rapidly. This is typical with most scammers, where they promise unsuspecting users high returns as a means to sway them into making investments on their fake platform. The Indian police mentioned that the scam, which was carried out under the pretense of crypto trading, saw the criminals use multiple bank accounts to steal funds off the platform. The fraudsters were said to be operating a well-designed, professional-looking online platform that looked just like the interface of most legitimate crypto wallets and trading websites. Traders were advised to invest in various digital assets, a typical move by criminals to make them spread out their funds. This way, once they lose money from trading an asset, they can still be tied to the criminal group through other investments in other digital assets. According to reports, the scammers even offered them guaranteed profits on their investments, with these profits ranging from 10% to 25% within days. Investigators with the Indian police said that they tracked a portion of the amount the criminal stole from their victims, which was about Rs. 2 lakh (approximately $2,400), to an IDFC First Bank account held by Patel. The money was sent to the account through the Layer 2 stage and was withdrawn through an ATM shortly after the deposit was made, the Indian police said. During the arrest, the Indian police seized undisclosed articles that they believed were linked to the financial transactions. “We believe Patel may be part of a broader network engaged in similar digital investment scams and we are continuing the probe to track additional beneficiaries and accomplices,” a senior officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate said. The rate of crimes connected to digital assets in India has ticked up in the last few days. A recent scam saw a man lose about Rs. 1.67 crore (approximately $200,000) through WhatsApp. The victim connected to the scammer who posed as a potential bride on a matrimonial website. The scammer started talking to the victim on April 11, claiming that she worked in a crypto trading firm based in Singapore. The victim was said to have initially sent about $583 to invest in the platform, making a profit of $100 from that single trade. The trade was enough to convince the victim to transfer heavy amounts to the scammer in the hopes of making more profits. “After the first transfer, the app showed an instant profit of Rs 8,300. Lured by the returns, I continued to ‘invest’ more money into the platform through multiple bank transfers and UPI payments,” the victim said. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

In a new interview with David Rubenstein, Dalio addresses the US dollar’s big decline against major currencies this year, saying that it could be foreshadowing an incoming phase of stagflation, which refers to a time of high inflation, high unemployment, and low economic growth. Dalio says in the end, while the dollar may underperform other currencies, those currencies also won’t be doing well relative to hard assets like gold. “I think the picture would be some version very similar to the 70s… And the 70s was a period in which there was stagflation. The thing we have to worry about is a stagflationary environment, because all the currencies went down. So when you were looking at ‘diversification,’ the problems that we’re talking about are not just American problems. We have a significant problem, but they’re European problems, they’re Japanese problems. There are Chinese problems. We’ve lived on promises, to be able to take that debt asset and convert it into money. And now there’s not enough money to go around, so I would say that when you ask the question, does it devalue in relation to other currencies? Probably, but the other currencies won’t see much of an appreciation. So that’s why I’m saying something like gold will be the better-performing currency.” The hedge fund legend recently warned that in order to address a looming fiscal crisis, the US government would need to cut spending and raise taxes to lower the annual deficit to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio. “This printing and devaluing is not good for those holding bonds as a storehold of wealth, and what’s bad for bonds and US credit markets is bad for everyone because the US Treasury market is the backbone of all capital markets, which are the backbones of our economic and social conditions. Unless this path is soon rectified to bring the budget deficit from roughly 7% of GDP to about 3% by making adjustments to spending, taxes, and interest rates, big, painful disruptions will likely occur.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Whether you made it to the annual Ethereum developer conference, hosted in the South of France, or were forced to stay at home, you won’t have caught everything that happened. There was just too much to take in. To save you from scrolling X in search of the key takeaways and major announcements, the following highlight reel incorporates the best bits. No retrospective could capture the full intensity of EthCC Cannes, both in terms of the heat and the ideas that were being tossed around like beach balls. From new product launches to razor sharp insights on the trends that will define the industry over the next year, here’s your tl;dr on EthCC Cannes: what happened, where, and why it matters. Let’s go. Wall Street Pledges Ethereum Loyalty Hosted from June 30 to July 3 in the glamorous resort of Cannes, EthCC Cannes has left an indelible mark on every delegate. Held in the iconic Palais des Festivals – famous for the Cannes Film Festival – EthCC 2025 drew developers, founders, and Wall Street heavyweights, blending high-stakes discussions with beach networking and exclusive parties. EthCC Cannes embodied crypto’s transformation from a niche experiment to the infrastructure powering global finance. Funded in part by Robinhood, the event highlighted surging interest from Wall Street in all things web3. Institutions like BlackRock, Deutsche Bank, Coinbase, and Kraken are building directly on Ethereum, whose decade-long uptime, security, and stability have made it ground zero for enterprise blockchain – despite the network’s unhurried scaling roadmap. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin noted at the conference that institutions like Ethereum on account of its dependability, explaining : “A lot of institutions basically tell us to our faces that they value Ethereum because it's stable and dependable, because it doesn't go down.” Tomasz Stańczak of the Ethereum Foundation echoed this, emphasizing Ethereum’s track record: “Ten years without stopping for a moment. Ten years of upgrades, with a huge dedication to security and censorship resistance.” Robinhood's launch of tokenized U.S. stocks and ETFs on Arbitrum, Deutsche Bank's tokenization platform on zkSync, and BlackRock's BUIDL fund exemplified this shift, with ETH gaining 6% weekly amid related stock rallies. The City of Cannes itself is exploring deeper crypto integration, aligning with Mayor David Lisnard's push for web3 adoption. The Graph and Binance Pay Drop Major News The conference buzzed with fresh launches and major news dropped by blockchain companies in attendance. Yaniv Tal, co-founder of The Graph, unveiled Hypergraph, a new data layer for collaborative, non-financial apps on Ethereum. Aiming to catalyze the release of “1M useful, delightful, non-financial apps” that prioritize user safety and shared knowledge networks, Tal highlighted how most mobile time is spent on non-DeFi apps, urging a shift beyond finance. Other reveals included Binance Pay's partnership with French fintech Lyzi, enabling over 80 Riviera businesses, from luxury hotels such as JW Marriott to beach clubs, to accept crypto payments via QR codes, with instant euro settlements and no gas fees. Supporting 100+ cryptocurrencies, the initiative offered stablecoin rewards for eligible purchases, boosting adoption in tourism hotspots like Cannes and Monaco. Elsewhere, MiniPay and Noah introduced seamless global-to-local stablecoin payments, allowing users to receive ACH/SEPA transfers as USDT and USDC and spend via local methods like M-Pesa or Pix – non-custodially and fee-free. The initiative targets freelancers and migrants in over 70 destinations, building upon the strong user base already in place thanks to MiniPay's 8 million wallets. Epic Web3 also launched its Dapps Hub at the concurrent L2con, with the goal of enhancing Layer 2 ecosystems. Networking With a View Amid the tech talks, EthCC's Cannes idyllic setting proved that real-world connections trump digital. Beachside networking and informal vibes at private estates and resorts fostered deeper discussions between the industry’s movers, shakers, and rising stars. Memorable moments included the Pudgy Penguins and My Neighbor Alice (MNA) event in Lummelunda, where over 700 attendees hatched eggs, created accounts, and dove into gameplay, complete with exclusive merch. The Tezos art show at TezDev 2025, held alongside EthCC at Hôtel Martinez, featured an immersive exhibition with works from over 30 artists via Objkt.com, including pieces by Diane Lindo, Anya, RJ, Morpho Genesis, and Lilyillo. It capped sessions on Tezos X, gaming on Etherlink, and RWA tokenization, blending art with tech in a continuous-screen display. GenLayer's Sunset Beach Salon stood out for its no-slides approach, focusing on “bites, bevs & high-quality signal.” Founders shared updates like RallyOnChain amid casual chats, capturing the event's relaxed yet productive energy. The rAAVE party at Villa Montana, attended by Chainlink's Sergey Nazarov and Aave's Stani Kulechov, wrapped things up on a high note. Why EthCC Cannes Slapped EthCC Cannes 2025 will be remembered for bringing Wall Street and web3 closer together, unleashing innovations like Hypergraph and crypto payments in luxury locales, and reviving the joy of in-person connections. As Bettina Boon Falleur, EthCC organizer, put it: “The prestige of the location, combined with the quality of talks, has reinforced Ethereum’s stature and purpose in the wider ecosystem.” The conference celebrated how far crypto has come, with Wall Street’s embrace marking a turning point. The flurry of new project announcements, from Hypergraph to Binance Pay partnerships, showed that away from the side-events and after-parties, there was still plenty of business getting done. Yet it’s the informal beach networking and quirky moments like the Pudgy Penguins hatching that will linger long, proving that even in a digital age, the human touch remains irreplaceable. Cannes was the best EthCC yet, it was widely agreed by the delegates who made the trip – until the next one at least. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The growing adoption rate of the XRP Ledger Protocol could push XRP to $10.15, with a possible maximum trading value of $10.83 in 2028. In 2031, the target price for XRP is between $16.24 and $17.59, with an average price of $16.92. XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future. Whether it will reach new highs or continue to grow steadily remains to be seen, but this crypto asset will undoubtedly play an important role in global financial institutions. So, how high can XRP realistically go? Will XRP reach 5 dollars? Let’s answer these questions in our XRP price prediction.

The coin’s value has jumped to $2.79 in the past 24 hours. Concurrently, the cryptocurrency has gained 0.85% of its worth today. This creates favorable circumstances for investors, as the cryptocurrency is now gaining value. XRP experienced positive sentiment during the past week, and the buying momentum is still gaining traction. XRP price analysis on the daily timeframe The one-day price chart of the XRP coin confirmed an upward trend for the cryptocurrency. The XRP/USD value has appreciated to a high of $2.79 for the day. Green candlesticks on the price chart signify continued buying activity. The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the volatility. This distance is increasing, leading to high volatility. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, which indicates a previous resistance, has shifted to $2.73, while its lower limit, serving as support, has moved to $1.91. XRP/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present within the overbought region. The indicator’s value has increased to index 80.15 in the past 24 hours. The ascending curve on the RSI graph reflects a rising buying momentum. If the bullish momentum continues to intensify, further upside is possible soon. However, as the coin is already overbought, the indicator can give a sell call at any time. XRP price analysis on the 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis of the XRP coin confirmed a bearish trend in the market, as a 20-hour bullish streak has finally triggered selling pressure and bulls need more strength to break above $2.84. The XRP/USD value has slightly decreased to $2.79 in the past few hours. The high volatility signals a higher chance of an upcoming reversal or further price escalation. The Bollinger Bands are converging, but the distance is significant, leading to high volatility. This prevalent volatility signifies higher market unpredictability. Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $2.93, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $2.40, securing the support. XRP/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is trending within the neutral region for now. Its value has decreased to index 66.35 in the last four hours.

Ripple price analysis gives a highly bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin value has increased to a high of $2.79 over the last 24 hours. The coin has gained up to 0.85 percent of its value. Technical indicators give positive signals, and the price charts also continue to project a bullish market scenario for the day. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple and the rising adoption might boost XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisition and CBDC development make XRP a good investment option in the long-term. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. It is advised to proceed with caution Why is XRP up? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has increased as buying momentum took hold, increasing the price to $2.79 during the day. The RSI increased to 80.15 at the same time and is in the overbought territory. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $3.38 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to double. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by the middle of next year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.84, achieved on January 7, 2018. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a lesser chance of reaching $20 by 2031. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is trading at five times its value from last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $17.59 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Dune Analytics data shows that almost 60% of transactions on XRPL are payments. Weekly payments on the network increased by more than 430% in less than two years. Dune Analytics also indicates that weekly payment transactions on the network moved from around 1.5 million in 2023 to over 8 million in 2025. Read more about it here . Lawyer Fred Rispoli states that the SEC and Ripple could reach a settlement regarding how XRP sales to institutions will be conducted in a way the SEC finds acceptable. Meanwhile, Ripple plans to further integrate XRP into institutional finance by acquiring Hidden Road for $1.25 billion. Read more about it here .

XRP historic price sentiment Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. By the middle of May, XRP touched $2.57; however, near the start of July, it is trending around the $2.26 range, as the market sentiment tilts towards the positive side.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS|REGULATION|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-13 09:20:00

Key Takeaways: Pump.fun raised $600 million in just 12 minutes, marking one of the largest ICOs to date. A block of 180 billion tokens was sold to private investors before the public sale. The platform’s rapid growth highlights a renewed interest in meme coins and ICO fundraising. The rapid fundraising effort ranks among the largest initial coin offerings (ICOs) ever and arrived just one day after Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, surged to a new all-time high. Operating on the Solana blockchain, Pump.fun announced on July 9 via X (formerly Twitter) its plan to sell 150 billion tokens at $0.004 apiece. 180 Billion Tokens Sold to Private Investors Ahead of Public Sale Prior to the public sale, a block of 180 billion tokens had already been sold at the same price to private investors. Confirming the figures to Bloomberg News, co-founder Alon Cohen said the total raised now stands at $1.32 billion. Notably, investors based in the US and UK were barred from participating due to regulatory restrictions. Despite some initial worries among crypto investors that this massive sale might overshadow the broader meme coin market, industry voices remain unfazed. Zaheer Ebtikar, founder of crypto fund Split Capital, remarked on the extreme swings in sentiment that typify the sector. “People go from max fear to max FOMO very quickly,” he told Bloomberg , referring to the sudden rush of buyers eager to get in on the sale. Meme coins have carved out a niche in the crypto space by blending internet culture with finance. Often linked to jokes, viral memes, and celebrity endorsements, they have captured the attention of retail traders and professionals alike. Even former US President Donald Trump launched his own meme coin shortly before his second inauguration in January, underscoring the trend’s reach. $PUMP will be launched through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in the ICO, 33% of the token supply is being sold: 18% in a private sale for institutional purchasers and 15% in a public sale. both private sale and public sale purchasers are on the exact same terms – each token… — pump.fun (@pumpdotfun) July 9, 2025 Since its 2024 debut, Pump.fun, founded by Cohen, Noah Tweedale, and Dylan Kerler, has emerged as a key player behind the recent surge in meme coin activity, particularly on Solana. The platform has drawn billions in investments, generating nearly $800 million in revenue, according to company spokespeople. Its success reflects a broader revival of ICOs, a fundraising method that once peaked at around $3 billion monthly in early 2018 before regulatory crackdowns and high-profile scams dampened enthusiasm. Pump.fun has announced that its tokens will be tradable between 48 and 72 hours following the sale’s conclusion. Pump.fun Acquires Kolscan Last week, Pump.fun announced its acquisition of the wallet tracking tool Kolscan, aiming to revolutionize on-chain trading. The integration will merge Kolscan’s analytics with Pump.fun’s social trading features, enhancing transparency, wallet tracking, and copy-trading capabilities. Co-founder Alon Cohen emphasized that trading is a “social sport,” highlighting the importance of community and shared insights in driving success within the ecosystem. As part of the deal, all Kolscan services will be made free to users. Pump.fun has already attracted tens of thousands of users and intends to build a scalable crypto social media platform, leveraging Kolscan’s tools to grow its community and influence.

The project is a $0.03 token, positioning itself not through hype, but through functional utility in real-world decentralized lending. Mutuum Finance has already sold more than 65% of presale stage 5 at $0.03. Investors are rushing in, this being the lowest MUTM will ever be. The project has raised more than $12.1 million and has attracted over 13,100 investors. As XRP continues to chart a steady, optimistic course, Mutuum Finance is generating serious buzz for its disruptive DeFi model, capturing investor attention with the potential for life-changing ROI. XRP Price Prediction for 2025 At present, XRP is trading around $2.42, a level largely shaped by its recovery from the standout January high near $3.00, an all-time peak reached amid favorable signals in Ripple’s legal battles. Technical and on-chain models diverge: some moderate forecasts, like Binance’s consensus model, peg XRP near $2.42 for mid‑July and projecting modest climb to around $2.95 by year‑end , while CoinCodex anticipates a trading band between $2.36–$3.49, averaging roughly $2.64 through 2025. More bullish analysts, including those from Bitget, suggest XRP may test $5, potentially extending upside toward $10–$15 if key resistance breaks and institutional adoption continues. Overall, XRP seems poised for gradual upward movement, barring sudden macro shifts or catalysts. Meanwhile, although XRP’s forecast paints a stable trajectory, investors are also keeping a close eye on Mutuum Finance. Strong Investor Interest Marks Stage 5 of Mutuum Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up some real steam as it climbs up Stage 5 of its presale. Having already amassed over 13100 early adopters and over $12.1 million in funding raised, the project is leaping giant strides as a top contender in the DeFi. Mutuum Finance, in a bid to contribute more to its DeFi, is launching a fully collateralized stablecoin backed by USD on the Ethereum blockchain. Contrary to highly risk-leveraged algorithmic stablecoins, the token has been designed in such a manner that will guarantee its value even during times of market fluctuation. Mutuum Finance has launched a Bug Bounty Program with CertiK, wherein a 50,000 USDT reward is provided. The bounty is divided into four levels of severity, i.e., the critical, major, minor, and low. This will balance out all the vulnerability and reward tiers. Rewards for Early Participants As a token of appreciation to the early supporters, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering a $100,000 giveaway . Ten winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens as a reward for being part of the early supporters of the project. Mutuum Finance’s Dual-Lending Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is constructed as a hybrid lending protocol that will serve the passive and active DeFi users. The users can earn passive income since they lend their USDT via smart contracts pools, which provide stable passive income in the project’s Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending protocol. In addition, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model enables borrowers and lenders to be as engaging as they can ever be in exchanging terms of an agreement and do not require a third party to have influence over them on their behalf. The model is more prevalent for the clients of less secure assets. XRP’s 2025 forecast shows steady gains, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is moving faster. With over $12.1 million raised, 13,100+ investors, and Stage 5 over 65% sold out at $0.03, MUTM offers real utility and massive upside. Backed by a CertiK audit, dual lending model, and a $100K giveaway, it’s built for impact. Grab your tokens now before prices rise.

XMR could reach a maximum price of $1,429.27 by the end of 2028. By 2031, Monero’s price may surge to $2,328.52. Monero (XMR) stands out in the cryptocurrency space for its strong focus on privacy and decentralization of transactions, making it one of the leading privacy focused cryptocurrencies. This makes it a popular choice for privacy advocates and those prioritizing security. The Monero ecosystem constantly evolves, marked by significant milestones like enhanced protocol upgrades and growing adoption across various sectors, which underscore its utility. As Monero progresses, many wonder about its future price trajectory. Will its unique features drive significant value growth, as many traders speculate? Can it sustain its competitive edge in the ever-evolving crypto market? Will XMR recapture its ATH at $517.62 in the long term forecast?

Monero price has support and resistance at $312 and $320, respectively. The Monero price analysis for July 12 shows low volatility as XMR consolidates around $325. Monero price analysis 1-day chart: XMR sticks to $325 The 24-hour XMR/USD price chart indicates a mixed market sentiment as the altcoin observes an increase of more than 65% of its value in the last few days as XMR rose from the $220 price level to the $400 mark. However, after reaching the $400 mark, the price crashed sharply to the $320 level where it has hovered since then. XMRUSDT Chart By TradingView The indicators reflect the increasing bullish price sentiment, as all three major technical indicators show neutral signs. The MACD is bullish at 2.23 units and shows falling bearish pressure at the current price level. The RSI also shares this sentiment as it stabilized toward 56.99 level suggesting room for further movement in either direction. The diverging Bollinger Bands suggest higher volatility, indicating that the $330 resistance may not hold for the week. Monero price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour price chart shows that Monero rapidly recovered after the price broke down below the descending trend’s bottom line. Currently the bulls seek to cross $330. XMRUSDT Chart By TradingView The RSI is at 56.40, suggesting bullish momentum as the price climbs back towards the $330 mark. The MACD, at -0.07, shows low bearish momentum on the 4-hour charts. Additionally, the EMAs are rising from the mean value, it suggests an optimistic market sentiment. These indicators collectively indicate a rising bullish trend below the $330 level, suggesting a climb towards higher supports.

XMRUSDT Chart By TradingView Monero price analysis shows that XMR saw a great start to this month as the price rose to the $360. However, the sharp crash to the $320 mark suggests strong bearish pressure. As expected, the price fell below $300 but was defended well below the level enabling a swift recovery. Now the bulls seek to go higher. According to our analysis, we expect the XMR price to rise towards the $345 mark after brief consolidation below the $335 mark. However, the bulls need to breach the $330 level and establish a foothold above the level to initiate a rally. Is Monero a good investment? Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality. Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice . Why is XMR up today? After reaching the $400 mark, the bulls were stretched thin and a bearish retracement followed with the price crashing sharply to the $320 level where it has hovered since then. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption. How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2030 suggests a minimum price of $1,048.76 and an average trading price of $1,142.11 . The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,208.35. Will XMR reach $1000? The chance of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinges on various factors, which will influence its future price movements . The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility are challenges. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, regulatory scrutiny and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals impact the current monero sentiment, making it challenging to become the star of the market. Monero’s commitment to privacy gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

In January 2024, Monero stayed stable around the $150.00 mark as market momentum remained low. However, the stability was short-lived as February crashed to $101.95. However, XMR showed swift recovery as it closed the month near the $150.00 level again. In March and April 2024, XMR saw a steady decline from $150.00 to $120.00, where it found key support. In May 2024, XMR observed steady bullish pressure as the price rose from $120.00, approaching resistance at $150. In June 2024, Monero (XMR) traded within the $150 – $175 price range as either side struggled to make a clear breakthrough. In July, the crypto traded around the $155 mark as the price volatility remained relatively low. XMR opened trading at $156.05 in August and ended the month at $176.00, making remarkable gains. September was bearish for the asset, as the price declined below the $160 mark by the end of the month. In October, Monero observed a steep crash and has been making a swift recovery since then. In December, Monero made remarkable strides as the asset’s price broke past the $220 mark, albeit briefly as it closed the month below $200. In January, Monero saw a bullish January as the price rose from below the $200 mark to $238 by the end of the month. In February, the price fell towards the $215 mark as bears dominate the markets. In March, the price observes mixed momentum and closed the month slightly below $215. In April the consolidation continued until late into the month when it spiked past the $325 mark before ending the month around $275. In May the price continued rising rapidly as the bulls cruised past $300 ending the month around $320. During June the price continued to observe high volatility but observed low net change as the asset closed the month around $313.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,XMR|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|FORKS|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-13 10:00:00

48152608,https://timestabloid.com/?p=74059,1752400822,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Dogecoin (DOGE) Leads Weekly Altcoin Rally, But Social Traders Are Rotating to a Project Primed to List at 2X",https://timestabloid.com/dogecoin-doge-leads-weekly-altcoin-rally-but-social-traders/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) surged 20% this week, reaching $0.1724, outpacing most altcoins. The rally, driven by a 112% spike in whale accumulation and $1.5B in futures volume, broke resistance at $0.186 on July 9–10, supported by a double-bottom pattern and rising channel. Expectations of a U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut and easing U.S.-BRICS trade tensions fueled momentum, though a late-session dip to $0.180 signals caution. Analysts eye $0.19 short-term, with $0.30–$0.47 as potential targets. Dogecoin (DOGE)’s rally boosts meme coin sentiment, potentially lifting SHIB and FLOKI in crypto markets. In stocks, blockchain firms may gain, but U.S.-BRICS tariff risks could spark volatility. In forex, a stronger dollar may cap Dogecoin (DOGE)’s upside, yet whale activity and ETF speculation could drive sustained gains, reinforcing Dogecoin (DOGE)’s role as a retail-driven asset. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) What separates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from the meme-fueled hype cycles is its structure. The platform is being built around real DeFi use cases, enabling users to lend, borrow, and earn — all within a fully decentralized, non-custodial ecosystem. The protocol’s unique dual-lending system supports both P2P and P2C models. This means holders of volatile meme assets like PEPE can finally unlock utility, while blue-chip token investors can generate passive income in a stable environment. Dogecoin (DOGE) has once again captured headlines with its explosive weekly rally, reigniting interest from retail traders and meme coin enthusiasts alike. But behind the scenes, wallet tracking tools are painting a different story. While Dogecoin (DOGE) pumps on sentiment, a growing number of smart traders are exiting speculative tokens and reallocating capital into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — a rising DeFi project now dominating social trading flows thanks to its utility-focused model and strong presale dynamics. In the P2P model, borrowers and lenders will be able to interact directly, negotiating interest rates and loan terms on their own. One future on-chain transaction might highlight a PEPE whale using 20 million PEPE tokens as collateral to borrow 2,500 USDT with a 60% collateralization ratio. Instead of selling off their meme holdings, this user will retain exposure while deploying the borrowed funds elsewhere — a smart strategy that will allow for liquidity extraction without sacrificing upside potential. Meanwhile, more conservative DeFi users will opt into the P2C system — which will be ideal for blue-chip investors who value consistent returns. For example, a long-term Solana (SOL) holder with $10,000 worth of assets will be able to deposit funds into a lending pool and will earn $820 annually at an 8.2% yield. The dynamic interest rates in these pools will be tied to utilization rates, ensuring optimal efficiency and incentivizing the right behavior from both sides of the transaction. As borrowing demand rises, APYs will adjust accordingly, rewarding liquidity providers in real time through mtTokens that will grow in value automatically. Presale Heats Up as MUTM Approaches Phase 6 Price Jump Currently in Phase 5, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised $12.15 million, with over 13,000 holders already onboard. At a presale price of $0.03, 72% of the current allocation has been sold, and the next phase will increase the token price by 20% to $0.035. Traders tracking presale momentum are already acting fast, knowing that the final listing price is expected at $0.06, giving Phase 5 buyers the potential for a 2x return right out of the gate. This projected upside isn’t just theoretical. Traders who exited DOT during its recent flat phase and entered Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in Phase 1 at $0.01 are now up 3x on paper — and tracking toward a 5–7x return post listing goes live. That kind of strategic rotation reflects why social sentiment is steadily shifting toward this DeFi-native project. While Dogecoin (DOGE) is entertaining to trade, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to generate value over time, backed by algorithmic interest rate models, real borrower demand, and a transparent system governed by smart contracts. Beyond its lending mechanics, the protocol is gearing up for a broader ecosystem rollout. Plans are in place for Layer-2 integration, which will significantly reduce transaction costs and increase throughput for both lenders and borrowers. A decentralized stablecoin is also in development, designed to maintain a $1 peg through algorithmic interest rate adjustments and overcollateralized borrowing mechanisms. Once launched, the stablecoin will only be minted by approved issuers, further reinforcing system stability while offering users additional tools for capital management. Security remains a top priority ahead of launch. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has partnered with CertiK to roll out a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program, ensuring every vulnerability is discovered and addressed before mainnet deployment. And to grow the early user base, the team is currently running a $100,000 giveaway — selecting ten winners who will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. These initiatives underscore Mutuum’s commitment to transparency, safety, and community-first growth. The numbers don’t lie. As wallet flows trend out of short-lived meme runs and into purpose-driven DeFi platforms, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is standing out as the strongest candidate to deliver long-term returns. With only 28% of Phase 5 allocation remaining and a 2X price jump locked in at listing, this isn’t just another presale — it’s a protocol that’s turning speculation into sustainable success.

Bitcoin STHs Accumulate While LTHs Take Profit,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-sths-accumulate-while-lths-take-profit/,"Over the last month, Bitcoin ranged within the $100,000 — $110,000 price region until its recent breakout to reach a new all-time high. On-chain data show that a shift in BTC holder behavior may have played a significant role in the flagship cryptocurrency’s recent price action. LTHs Begin Distributing, But STHs Accumulate In a July 12 post on the X platform, on-chain analyst Boris explained how a shift in Bitcoin holder activity has affected the market over the past months. This explanation was based on indicators measuring the Accumulation Vs Distribution of Long-Term Holders (LTH) and Short-Term Holders (STH). For these two holder categories, the metric tracks and analyzes wallet behavior to determine whether they are increasing or decreasing their Bitcoin holdings over time. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Records: What Miners and Leverage Traders Are Doing Behind the Scenes For the long-term holders, the chart above shows how accumulation grew from the later days of May to the end of June. This is represented by the growing green graphs over the red. Within the same timeframe, the chart below shows short-term holders were represented more by the red graphs than the green, indicating more distribution than accumulation in the past month. Boris credited the LTHs for Bitcoin’s survival above the $100,000 support zone. “Despite heavy STH distribution and retail selling pressure, BTC defended the 100K support — a clear sign of structural accumulation led by LTH wallets,” the on-chain analyst said. According to Boris, the short-term holders were observed to have sold more than 563,000 BTC as Bitcoin continued to range. As this happened, the Long-Term holders steadily accumulated Bitcoin, and this absorbed most of the selling pressure from STHs. However, this dynamic seems to have reversed very recently. The online pundit reported that the Long-Term Holders started distributing their Bitcoin holdings. This sell-off from the LTHs may be a result of profit-taking, as the cryptocurrency’s upward drift would necessitate. On the other hand, the short-term holders have started to accumulate Bitcoin. This trend seen with this reactive group of investors indicates renewed retail interest or speculative entry amidst the current bullish rally. Boris further inferred that this handover from LTH support to STH support must have fuelled Bitcoin’s latest breakout, as short-term momentum is injected into the market. What’s Next For Bitcoin? While this rotation of supply between holder classes may not be strange in crypto market cycles, the scale and timing of this switch suggest that Bitcoin’s price action holds more interesting rallies in the near future. However, if the short-term buying pressure should taper, the absence of long-term support may cause a lower support to be retested. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at $117,300, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin Soars Past $118,800—Breakout Or Brutal Bull Trap?

His fortune of 1.096 million BTC currently equates to $129.23 billion based on data from Arkham Intelligence. Although Forbes’s real-time billionaire tracker doesn’t officially include Satoshi Nakamoto, its data would place him in 11th position. In that spot, he’d surpass Michael Dell, whose net worth is $125.1 billion. Sergey Brin currently holds 10th place with $140.3 billion. In order for Satoshi Nakamoto to become the richest man in the world and take Elon Musk’s spot, the price of a single Bitcoin needs to be around $366,241. This will make his Bitcoin holdings of 1.095 million BTC equivalent to roughly $401.0 billion. To reach that valuation, each Bitcoin would need to rally by more than 180% from its present price. Analyst predicts Bitcoin at $400,000 Months ago, anonymous crypto trader apsk32 predicted that Bitcoin would hit the $400,000 price point. His prediction is based on a mathematical model of network growth. The analyst created a model that consists of three plots. The first plot shows historical gold prices in US dollars per ounce. The second plot shows Bitcoin’s market capitalization against the price of gold. Apsk32 stated that BTC is following the path of gold, which hit an all-time high of $3,500.05 per ounce. He explained that modeling Bitcoin’s price against the US dollar doesn’t make sense, as the Federal Reserve will continue to print money. Bitcoin’s gold normalized market cap based on power law. Source: apsk32 via X. The growth of Bitcoin’s market capitalization measured in gold ounces follows a straight line, which is clear in the top-left plot. This straight line suggests that Bitcoin follows a power law, aligning with Metcalfe’s Law of network growth. The analyst then calculated Bitcoin’s implied prices in US dollars based on BTC’s supply at every point in time and gold’s historical data. In the third plot, he created a log plot like Bitcoin’s famous Rainbow price chart, but added Bitcoin’s implied prices over the past 16 years. In terms of support bands, he added a blue band named “years-ahead.” The support bands “years-ahead” range from 0 through 5 years ahead of the underlying implied BTC price or power line. According to historical data, Bitcoin’s price has stayed below the five-years-ahead line, even during previous bubbles. This framework identifies realistic BTC price ranges and shows that, for this cycle, the one-year-ahead band lines up at around $400,000. Reaching that BTC price target would make Satoshi Nakamoto the richest person on Earth. In the past 7 days, Bitcoin has gained over 9.6%, jumping from $108,301 to its all-time high of $118,667 based on CoinGecko data. Currently, Bitcoin trades at $117,934 with a 24-hour trading volume of $19.8 billion. The crypto king has a market capitalization of $2.343 trillion with 19,891,615 coins in circulation.

Flutter, which owns gambling sites Betfair and Paddy Power, disclosed that up to 800,000 customers have had their personal information exposed due to a third-party breach, the Irish Times reports . In an email to customers in Ireland and Britain, Flutter said it had “recently detected that an unauthorised third party [gained access] to limited betting account information” relating to some of its customers. The breach involved customers’ usernames, email addresses and IP addresses, but in certain cases, address details were also exposed. Flutter told customers that the hack involved “details of some recent activity on your account and technical data like your device ID and IP address”. “The nature of this incident means that regrettably, some of your personal information has been impacted.” A spokesperson for the company told the Irish Times that no passwords, ID documents or usuable card or parment details were impacted. The company now says that “the unauthorised access has been removed and the incident contained” and that an investigation found that the “affected information was isolated to limited betting account information”. Flutter also promises a full investigation and to examine how to prevent any similar breaches from occurring in the future.

The $1.6 trillion banking giant’s “Cross-Asset Winners & Losers” report, released July 9, revealed Bitcoin’s impressive 18.2% year-to-date gain, decisively outpacing traditional safe-haven currencies including the Swedish krona, Swiss franc, and euro. Source: Cointelegraph on X Meanwhile, the US dollar has plummeted 10.1% since January, claiming last place among the 14 tracked asset classes. This institutional endorsement arrives as Bitcoin climbed multiple all-time highs, surging past $118,856 amid massive buying pressure from spot ETFs and corporate treasuries. US-based Bitcoin ETFs recorded over $1 billion in daily inflows for two consecutive days, a first since their January 2024 launch. US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded over $1 billion in inflows for two straight days, a first since their launch in January 2024. #Bitcoin #ETFs https://t.co/O32A2zt4ry — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 12, 2025 BlackRock’s IBIT alone attracted $953 million on Friday, helping push total ETF assets above $140 billion. The surge coincided with President Trump’s social media declaration that crypto is going “through the roof,” triggering massive institutional repositioning. Because of these institutional validations and growing demand, Bitcoin has positioned itself for continued parabolic growth toward $150,000 and beyond. Institutional Cup and Handle Formation Points to $150,000 Target Bitcoin’s technical structure reveals compelling evidence of massive institutional accumulation through multiple cup and handle patterns across different timeframes. Source: Coinvo on X The weekly chart shows Bitcoin completing what could be the largest cup and handle formation in its history, with the current pattern forming across the $60,000-$110,000 range. Previous cup formations in the $25,000-$30,000 and $50,000-$70,000 ranges led to explosive breakouts toward $70,000 and $100,000, respectively. Taking it even further, the gold versus Bitcoin comparison chart reveals similarities in institutional accumulation patterns. Gold’s prolonged sideways trading around $2,100 created cup-shaped accumulation zones before breaking into a rally reaching $3,354, representing a 60% increase. Bitcoin currently mirrors this exact pattern, having tested and retested resistance around $106,500 before breaking above $118,000. Indirectly, the methodical nature of this accumulation indicates institutional players are gradually building positions without disrupting market movement. Furthermore, exchange reserves data provides fundamental confirmation of the supply shock driving prices higher. Bitcoin held on exchanges declined dramatically from 3.25 million to 2.55 million BTC, removing nearly 700,000 BTC from readily available trading inventory. This represents 3.3% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply being withdrawn for long-term storage. The trajectory suggests reserves could decline to 2.0-2.2 million BTC, reaching the lowest levels since early 2018. The RSI climbing to 73.56 indicates overbought conditions similar to late May when Bitcoin stalled near $110,000. However, institutional accumulation creates different market dynamics than retail-driven rallies. The persistent buying pressure from ETFs, corporate treasuries, and sovereign entities suggests any pullbacks to $110,000-$111,000 would be quickly absorbed, creating launching pads for moves toward $120,000-$125,000. Elliott Wave Analysis Signals Sovereign Adoption Supercycle Bitcoin’s complete cycle chart shows the cryptocurrency in Wave 5 of a larger supercycle driven by institutional and sovereign adoption rather than retail speculation. Unlike previous waves fueled by halving events and retail FOMO, the current phase involves strategic allocation models from entities planning minimum 20-year holding periods. This fundamental shift creates more persistent demand patterns that could sustain higher prices for extended periods. The chart annotations reference countries potentially using Bitcoin to address national debt, indicating sovereign wealth funds and central banks entering the market. These represent the largest capital pools globally, and their participation would dwarf previous institutional adoption waves. Polymarket odds now suggest close to 80% probability of Bitcoin reaching $120,000 by month-end, with 92% likelihood of hitting this level before year-end. BTC strike prices on Polymarket? Oh heck yeah! But it's not even mid-July and we already hit $118,000 $120,000 seems easy $999,969 programed HIGHER pic.twitter.com/DchAgWQ5Tw — Wendy O (@CryptoWendyO) July 12, 2025 Particularly, President Trump’s proposal for a historic 300 basis point interest rate cut creates ideal conditions for Bitcoin’s continued ascent. The massive monetary expansion would trigger massive dollar debasement while driving institutional money into non-sovereign assets. Historical analysis projects dramatic asset price inflation, with the dollar’s weakness positioning Bitcoin as a primary beneficiary of continued currency depreciation. These policy tailwinds and accelerating institutional adoption suggest Bitcoin could reach $150,000 – $200,000 as traditional resistance levels become irrelevant in pure price discovery mode. BTC Hyper: Unlocking Bitcoin’s DeFi Potential During the Bull Run As Bitcoin reaches new heights, limitations around transaction speed and fees become increasingly apparent for investors seeking to maximize their holdings’ utility. BTC Hyper emerges as a compelling solution, offering a Layer-2 scaling platform built on the Solana Virtual Machine that makes Bitcoin transactions instant and cost-effective while unlocking DeFi opportunities previously unavailable to BTC holders. The $HYPER token presale has already raised over $2.5 million, offering early investors high APY staking rewards ahead of the Q3/Q4 2025 mainnet launch. Unlike traditional Bitcoin investments that remain static, BTC Hyper enables users to bridge their BTC holdings and access DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and gaming dApps. The wrapped Bitcoin functionality allows seamless movement between the Bitcoin mainnet and the Hyper network without KYC requirements for core features. With mainnet deployment scheduled for late 2025, BTC Hyper positions itself perfectly for Bitcoin’s institutional adoption wave. Early adopters can purchase $HYPER tokens using ETH, USDT, or BNB through platforms like Best Wallet, with major exchange listings planned post-mainnet launch.

Among these, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is garnering attention due to its distinct Layer 2 blockchain structure and rapid presale progress. With over $4.7 million raised and nearly 3.9 billion tokens sold, Little Pepe is leading a group of five tokens identified by market watchers as potential millionaire-makers in this cycle. Other notable performers include Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ondo (ONDO), and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN). Little Pepe Gains Traction During Presale Stage Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has entered its fifth presale stage, offering tokens at $0.0014, which is a notable increase from its initial presale stage. With its planned public listing at a higher price, early participants are positioned for a multi-fold return. Current presale metrics show $4,763,962 raised and over 3.9 billion tokens sold out of a total of 5.25 billion allocated for this phase. The next presale stage will see the token price increase to $0.0015. Built as a Layer 2 blockchain optimized for meme coins, Little Pepe supports high-speed, low-cost transactions. The network also features a dedicated launchpad tailored for meme-themed token projects, complete with anti-bot protection during launches. The token is scheduled to be listed on centralized exchanges in 2025, and the development team is focusing on building out its ecosystem. A $777,000 giveaway campaign is currently underway to support further engagement, providing additional incentives for contributors. Dogecoin (DOGE) The pandemic action of larger markets has found relative stability in Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) and renewed interest as the broader market rallies. DOGE gained 5.31% in 24 hours and was at the price of 0.18USD, with a market cap of 27.15 billion dollars. The trading volume was up to $1.71 billion as which shows greater involvement of investors. DOGE does not have a fixed supply of its tokens and the circulating supply is still 150.03 billion. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) registered a 4.43% growth within the same timeline, and rose to a price level of $0.00001245. Its token also recorded intense volume as it traded $213 million in 24 hours. Its benchmarked value is currently at $7.34 billion, with a close to full supply of 589.5 trillion tokens. The two tokens are still gaining momentum in terms of community traversing through the current bullish spree. Ondo (ONDO) Ondo (ONDO) has seen a 4.75% price increase in the past 24 hours, with its valuation now at $0.8417. The token's market cap has risen to $2.65 billion, supported by a 56% spike in trading volume. Ondo has 145,760 holders and a total value locked of 1.39 billion dollars, which indicates interest by institutions. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) Although Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) registered a small appreciation of 6.32% at the price of $1.14, it registered a large change in trade volume with a 51% increase. Though the short-term trading is lower, its high liquidity and a market cap of $1.14 billion do not make it lose the radar of potential development. These five tokens, which are headed by Little Pepe (LILPEPE), are becoming some of the most prominent contenders of this lengthening crypto bull run that are likely to be some of the largest investment narratives of this cycle.

There’s buzz that XYZVerse might deliver returns exceeding 10,000%, surpassing the usual gains from utility tokens. This article explores why XYZVerse is capturing attention and what it could mean for those seeking the next big play. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price , far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.003333 by Stage 12, with over 70% of the $15 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. By bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different—something with entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Pi Network: The Cryptocurrency You Can Mine on Your Phone Imagine mining cryptocurrency without expensive equipment or draining your phone’s battery. That’s the idea behind Pi Network, a digital currency launched in 2019 by Stanford graduates. Pi lets anyone mine coins by simply checking in daily on their app. Instead of energy-intensive processes like Bitcoin’s mining, Pi uses an efficient system where users build trust circles by nominating a few reliable contacts. This creates a web of verified members, making the network secure and accessible to everyone. Pi Network has the potential to change how we think about cryptocurrency. It rewards users not just for mining, but also for growing the network and running full nodes on computers. With the crypto market increasingly valuing sustainability and accessibility, Pi stands out. Unlike traditional coins that require massive computing power, Pi’s approach is user-friendly and energy-efficient. As it prepares to enter its “open network” phase, Pi could become an attractive option in the current market, offering a fair and eco-friendly way to participate in the world of digital money. Conclusion Tokens like PI are promising, but XYZVerse’s unique sports-meme blend aims for 20,000% growth, offering early investors a standout opportunity in the bull run.

Despite the crypto-fueled return to office of United States President Donald Trump and his promise to the crypto industry, one character remains embroiled in the federal government’s war on crypto: the co-founder of popular crypto mixing service Tornado Cash, Roman Storm. According to reports , Roman Storm is set to go on trial in New York on Monday for criminal conspiracy to commit money laundering and evading United States sanctions. Leading the charge to prosecute Storm is one-time crypto villain, turned sweetheart, turned villain, Jay Clayton, who served as the chairman of the SEC during the first administration of Donald Trump. Former SEC Chair to lead the prosecution of Roman Storm Most of the prominent figures and participants in the crypto industry in the United States have always had bad words for former SEC Chair Gary Gensler during the Biden administration, with some of them even throwing a “party” after they heard Donald Trump would be replacing him when his tenure started. This was because he was the face of the agency when they started initiating a crackdown against crypto firms, taking some of them to court, while forcing others into settlements. Meanwhile, what the market didn’t realize was that these crackdowns and lawsuits first started under Clayton. For instance, in one of his last acts as SEC chair in late 2020, Clayton presided over a $1.3 billion lawsuit against industry favorite Ripple . According to Clayton, the company offered unregistered securities when it sold XRP, a token that was developed by Ripple, to its investors. While most people say Gensler was the force behind that lawsuit, owing to the fact that he was keen on making Ripple pay for what he claims they did, it was Clayton who initiated the lawsuit and passed it down to Gensler. Most of the cases that Gensler would later handle as SEC chair followed the same line, making him one of the most hated until he left the helm of affairs at the agency. During his time with the agency, Clayton brought 57 cases against crypto firms, ICOs, and other blockchain-based projects, a statistic he talked about proudly on his way out of the agency in 2021. After he left the agency, Clayton returned to practicing law at New York firm Sullivan & Cromwell. Interestingly, he also joined the advisory board of Fireblocks, a crypto firm that provides custody services. Clayton returned to serve in the government in April after President Trump appointed him as the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, a post that will oversee some of the Department of Justice’s high-profile criminal prosecutions, including that of Luigi Mangione, Sean Combs, and former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. The list also includes Storm, whom the Trump administration has continued to pursue charges against, despite the Treasury Department dropping its case against his platform earlier this week. Trump administration could set a precedent for DeFi While crypto leaders have been slow to criticize the decisions taken by the Trump administration due to the numerous gifts it has handed to them, advocates have expressed worries that a successful prosecution could set a harmful precedent that will target software developers and may even destroy the American DeFi industry. Storm was also vocal about the effects of his upcoming trial, saying, “If I lose, DeFi dies with me.” And yet, under Clayton’s leadership, the Trump DOJ SDNY’s office is moving ahead with the case against Storm. Clayton’s name has been seen in every pre-trial motion filed by the DOJ in Storm’s case, which has seen some cases successfully prevent certain pro-crypto legal precedents from being discussed at trial. According to a source familiar with the operations at the SDNY, motions filed by the office’s prosecutors are signed by the US Attorney who oversees cases in the district but does not handle day-to-day litigation. Storm’s trial is expected to begin on Monday in lower Manhattan. The trial will be a sort of crypto reunion as the case’s judge, Katherine Failla, previously oversaw the SEC’s years-long battle against Coinbase, which was dismissed in February by the Trump administration.

Here’s why",https://timestabloid.com/veteran-analyst-says-xrp-89100-price-isnt-just-a-dream-heres-why/,"Veteran crypto analyst Crypto Bitlord has shared a highly ambitious projection for XRP, suggesting that the digital asset could reach as high as $2,500. The comment was accompanied by a chart showing XRP/USD currently trading at approximately $2.8, up 1.25% on the day. The chart also illustrates previous massive upward moves with annotations of large percentage gains and emojis to symbolize potential future momentum. In his post , Crypto Bitlord argued that XRP achieving $2,500 is not merely a fantasy, citing historical precedent. He stated that a pump similar to XRP’s 2017 price surge would already push the token to at least $2,000. His tweet explicitly noted: “$XRP at $2,500 isn’t just a dream. Because a pump like 2017 would easily clear $2,000. Fact: The yearly resistance is now free, so expect vertical price discovery.” The analyst’s mention of “vertical price discovery” points to a view that the removal of significant resistance levels on long-term charts could allow for rapid, significant price increases as new territory is explored. $XRP at $2,500 isn’t just a dream. -Because a pump like 2017 would easily clear $2,000 Fact: The yearly resistance is now free so expect vertical price discovery. pic.twitter.com/A4G3PasuVk — Crypto Bitlord (@crypto_bitlord7) July 11, 2025 Other Analysts Question the Feasibility Reactions to Bitlord’s forecast varied considerably among other users in the crypto community. Another analyst, TM Research, acknowledged the possibility of a strong move but expressed skepticism toward the $2,500 figure. TM Research wrote : “Let’s see where $XRP lands at the end of this cycle. The move into price discovery will be fantastic. Very doubtful it hits $2,500 though…” This response suggests cautious optimism about XRP’s prospects without endorsing the upper end of Bitlord’s forecast. A more critical perspective was offered by another user, STU, who pointed out the unrealistic market capitalization implications of a $2,500 XRP. He responded : “$250T FDV?!? 10x the mcap of Gold. Next you’re gonna tell me that fairy tale that mcap doesn’t apply to XRP. Man, these outrageous price expectations are only going to get ppl rekt. Do better.” STU’s comment highlights a common argument against high price targets for XRP, pointing out that the implied fully diluted valuation at such levels would exceed the combined value of major global markets. This is a scenario many consider unrealistic. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Chart Annotations Highlight Historical Surges The chart shared by Crypto Bitlord included several notable annotations. It showed previous vertical price movements of over 80,000% and 84,000% on large green candlesticks, marked with arrows. These were paired with emojis of a gorilla, a sloth, and a hatching chick, likely meant to symbolize phases of strength, patience, and new beginnings, respectively. The current price action at $2.69 was highlighted, indicating that, in his view, XRP is poised for another large move upward now that historical resistance has been cleared. A Divided Outlook on XRP’s Long-Term Trajectory Crypto Bitlord’s prediction expresses his belief that XRP retains the potential for extreme upward movement , provided conditions similar to those in 2017 are replicated. However, other voices in the community continue to caution that such lofty price targets could mislead investors if not critically examined. As XRP trades just under $3, the debate over its longer-term trajectory remains prominent among analysts and traders alike.

Saylor, who holds approximately $54 billion worth of Bitcoin through his company, stated that he has no plans to sell despite his 70% gain on paper. Saylor reiterated his long-term confidence in Bitcoin, saying, “I will continue to buy from the top. Bitcoin is my exit strategy.” According to Saylor, Bitcoin has now become a trillion-dollar asset class, in the same league as giants like Apple, Google, and Microsoft. However, Saylor pointed out a key difference: “BTC is not a company, it’s an asset class. The capital structure of companies isn’t large enough to accommodate trillions of dollars in savings.” Related News: A Signal for Big Accumulation in 18 Altcoins: Whales Withdrawing Huge Amounts to Cold Wallets from Binance Saylor said that Bitcoin competes not only with technology giants but also with traditional store of value instruments such as gold, the S&P index and real estate, and that Bitcoin is technically superior compared to these asset classes. Saylor concluded: “There is no reason to sell the winners and buy the losers.” *This is not investment advice.

However, its potential 103x ROI forecast has started raising questions amidst growing concerns about market conditions, scalability issues, and competition. Investors looking for clarity and solid returns are now focusing on Ruvi AI (RUVI), a newcomer that combines transparency, real-world utility, and a structured growth model to deliver safer and bigger gains. With Ruvi AI’s audited security, strategic partnerships, and early success, analysts believe its potential far outweighs the risks tied to legacy projects like Solana. Here’s why Ruvi AI is gaining ground and why it might be the smarter bet for forward-thinking investors. Audit and Liquidity Build Confidence A defining edge of Ruvi AI lies in its foundation of security and transparency, reassuring investors in a space known for its volatility. The project underwent a third-party audit conducted by CyberScope, one of the most respected blockchain security auditors in the industry. This guarantees that Ruvi AI’s smart contracts are both reliable and free of vulnerabilities, adding an important layer of trust among early backers. Additionally, Ruvi AI’s partnership with WEEX Exchange ensures post-presale liquidity, a critical consideration often overlooked by emerging crypto projects. This strategic collaboration means investors won’t face trading delays or liquidity concerns upon public listing, delivering a smooth experience for buying and selling. These firm precautions make Ruvi AI more appealing compared to Solana, which faces scalability bottlenecks. Coupled with the rising skepticism surrounding Solana’s lofty predictions, Ruvi AI’s robustness offers an attractive alternative. Current Presale Success and Growth Trajectory Ruvi AI has quickly built momentum, reflecting its strong market potential. Here’s what the ongoing presale looks like: $2.3 million raised so far. Over 185 million tokens sold, underlining early popularity. A growing community of 2,100+ holders, signaling investor confidence. Currently priced at just $0.015 per token during Phase 2, Ruvi AI provides a ground-floor opportunity. By the presale’s conclusion, the price is guaranteed to rise to $0.07 per token, offering an almost 5x return for those who get in early. Further enhancing its appeal, analysts predict Ruvi AI will reach $1 per token post-listing, delivering a 66x ROI that outshines Solana’s speculative 103x forecast, which remains unsubstantiated by similar structured growth. Real-World Utility Elevates Ruvi AI Unlike many tokens, Ruvi AI’s value doesn’t hinge on hype, it’s grounded in real-world applications that address challenges in marketing, entertainment, and finance. By integrating blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI), Ruvi AI creates scalable solutions to inefficiencies across these critical industries. Revolutionizing Marketing Ruvi AI offers businesses AI-powered marketing tools to optimize ad campaigns, clarify targeting, and minimize wasted ad spend. Companies leveraging these insights can maximize their ROI, making Ruvi AI indispensable in modern marketing. Empowering Entertainment Digital creators stand to gain greatly from Ruvi AI’s blockchain-secured payment systems, designed to deliver fair and transparent compensation. Additionally, Ruvi AI’s AI-driven analytics provide creators with actionable insights into audience behavior, enabling them to grow their platforms and revenue streams strategically. Transforming Finance Global finance also benefits from Ruvi AI’s secure, fraud-resistant payment systems, which simplify complex, cross-border transactions. By cutting transaction times and reducing costs, Ruvi AI appeals to businesses and consumers looking for reliable, transparent financial solutions. Maximizing Returns With VIP Investment Tiers Ruvi AI rewards early supporters through VIP investment tiers that amplify returns across all budget levels. Here’s a closer look at what investors can gain: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tiers allow investors to maximize Ruvi AI’s upward momentum and ensure significant returns, regardless of their initial investment scale. Why Ruvi AI Outshines Solana Solana undoubtedly made waves with its groundbreaking transaction speeds and developer-friendly ecosystem. However, doubts surrounding its 103x projection and challenges with scalability have forced many investors to pause. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, delivers a stable, innovative, and transparent foundation, coupled with real-world demand and a clear growth strategy. Its starting price of $0.015 per token and achievable $1 target highlight Ruvi AI’s potential to generate substantial returns quickly. For those looking to combine security, scalability, and profitability, Ruvi AI emerges as the smarter investment choice over Solana.

For those hunting the top meme coins to buy for 2025, it’s time to buckle up. From the icy legend of Arctic Pablo Coin , to the brain-boosting mechanics of Tutorial, and the DeFi-hopping antics of Fwog, the list is stacked with wild contenders. Add the chill vibes of Just a Chill Guy, the muscle-packed mayhem of SPX6900, and the cinematic, AI-fueled saga of Act I: The AI Prophecy, and it’s clear: meme coins are no longer just jokes—they’re investments with narrative and edge. This isn’t just a list. It’s a lineup hotter than a GPU on overclock, featuring the top meme coins to buy for 2025 before they go parabolic. 1. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) – The Frostbitten Gem With Legendary Roi Imagine a snowmobile slicing through enchanted tundra, carving a trail through frozen myths and buried treasure. That’s Arctic Pablo Coin , the breakout star among the top meme coins to buy for 2025. This isn’t just another meme coin presale—it’s a full-blown crypto fairytale with a turbo-charged storyline. With Pablo’s latest stop at Location 31: Frigid Fortress, investors aren’t just watching history—they’re riding shotgun through it. Priced at $0.00047 and aiming for a listing at $0.008, Arctic Pablo offers some of the most explosive upside in the meme coin market. A simple $5,000 investment gets you 10,638,300 APC tokens. If it hits its target, that stack could snowball into $85,106.40—a legendary ROI that puts it squarely among the top meme coins to buy for 2025. What makes Arctic Pablo stand out from other contenders is its narrative-driven presale format. Each week unveils a new mythical location, ending with unsold tokens burned—shrinking supply and boosting long-term value. This gamified approach makes it one of the top meme coins to buy for 2025 for investors looking beyond the basic pump-and-dump hype. Built on the Binance Smart Chain (BEP20), the project has already raised over $2.9 million, showing serious traction. The 66% APY staking rewards offer an extra incentive, with tokens locked for two months from launch—perfect for long-term holders. No wonder it’s catching fire on every serious investor’s radar for the top meme coins to buy for 2025. Why did this coin make it to this list?

Tutorial – The Meme Coin That Teaches While It Moons Tutorial is flipping the script by combining meme culture with bite-sized crypto learning. It’s like if Khan Academy and Dogecoin had a baby raised by Reddit. Every token interaction teaches you something new—wallet safety, staking how-tos, or even tax strategies. What makes Tutorial one of the top meme coins to buy for 2025 isn’t just the fun factor; it’s the gamified education and utility baked into every tap. You’re not just investing—you’re leveling up. Holders get access to NFT badges, airdrops tied to learning milestones, and Tutorial Quests where you earn crypto for completing crypto. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Tutorial has created a new lane in the meme coin space—educational engagement. With high retention, increasing social sentiment, and viral potential, it’s a coin that feeds your portfolio and your brain. 3. Fwog – The Meme Amphibian With DeFi Depth Don’t let the ribbiting memes fool you—Fwog is more than a green goofball. It’s a meme coin that’s hopped into the DeFi pond with features you’d expect from serious projects. With liquidity staking, bridge mechanics across chains, and community-run governance, Fwog’s tech is as loud as its memes. It’s got Web3 influencers like @FrogGod and @SlippyCrypto doing weekly spaces, and meme campaigns have even landed Fwog a Times Square ad. The roadmap includes launching FrogSwap, a mini-DEX tailored to frog-based tokens. Yes, really. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Fwog blends old-school meme energy with serious tokenomics and community-first mechanics. It’s hopping into 2025 with utility, momentum, and a cult following. 4. Just a Chill Guy – Vibes, Virality, And Value Ever wish your crypto portfolio had a “chill” setting? Enter Just a Chill Guy —a meme coin that’s laid-back by design but fierce on the charts. He’s the unbothered mascot of a generation sick of rug pulls and utility overload. The value here isn’t complexity—it’s relatability. Launched as an ERC-20 token, Chill Guy has rapidly become the poster boy for mental health in crypto. Its no-pressure roadmap includes stress-free staking, wellness-based NFTs, and donations to de-stigmatize burnout culture. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because in a world of hype and high stress, Chill Guy is a breath of fresh blockchain air. It’s making serenity profitable—and turning mental health into meme wealth. 5. SPX6900 – Gym Bros, Gains, And Gas Fees Protein shakes, meme flexes, and financial alpha— SPX6900 is where Crypto Twitter meets the squat rack. This gym-bro token isn’t just for laughs. It’s built for the culture of “pump it both ways”—body and bags. Born on the Ethereum blockchain, SPX6900 plays into strength memes while leveraging tokenomics that push gains harder than a deadlift PR. With anti-whale mechanics, staking bonuses for active users, and even token burns tied to exercise milestones (tracked via partner apps), this coin is shredded with utility. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because it taps into two highly emotional drivers—health and wealth. SPX6900 has carved out a hyper-specific niche and is pumping hard into 2025. 6. Act I: The AI Prophecy – The Meme That Saw It Coming When ChatGPT memes meet crypto utility, you get Act I: The AI Prophecy—a narrative-driven coin where each stage of the roadmap reads like a screenplay. With AI-generated art, lore, and interactions, this token plays like a movie where every holder is part of the plot.

Three names are currently leading that charge: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), and dogwifhat (WIF). All three possess the explosive growth potential that meme coin investors crave, and each one could turn a $3,000 investment into $300,000 or more in just 15 weeks, provided the right market momentum and timing are present. Let’s dive into why these three coins could be your best shot at a 100x return in this phase of the bull cycle. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin With Utility and Insane ROI Potential Among all new meme coins in 2025, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is arguably the most promising—and also the most disruptive. Priced at just $0.0014 in its stage 5 presale, LILPEPE has already raised over $4.6 million and sold more than 3.8 billion tokens. But what makes it a serious BONK competitor isn’t just its meme energy—it’s the infrastructure being built behind it. LILPEPE is launching its own Layer-2 blockchain, tailored exclusively for meme coins. This L2 promises sniper bot resistance, ultra-low gas fees, and lightning-fast transactions, giving developers and traders a secure, meme-friendly environment. Alongside this is the Meme Launchpad, which enables the launch of future meme tokens on the LILPEPE chain. This utility is paired with aggressive marketing, confirmed CEX listings, and a $777,000 giveaway, making LILPEPE an explosive contender. If the token hits even $0.14, which is well within meme coin breakout territory, a $3,000 investment at current prices would grow into $300,000 or more. For meme investors, LILPEPE is not just the next PEPE—it could be even bigger. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): From NFT Darling to Meme Coin Royalty Pudgy Penguins, at $0.014 with a $926 million market cap, are tied to 8,888 Ethereum-based NFTs. Its Pudgy World launch on zkSync, blending toys and on-chain assets, drives mainstream appeal. Analysts expect $0.10 by Q4, representing a 952% gain, as NFT interest surges. PENGU’s merchandise and licensing deals expand its reach, offering more than BONK’s pure meme play. Its low price and cultural pull make it a 2025 breakout candidate, with NFT utility fueling long-term value. The token’s price is still in its early phases, giving it room to run. Suppose community expansion continues and the Pudgy brand makes a stronger push into crypto utility. In that case, PENGU could easily 50x to 100x from current levels, especially if NFT hype merges with meme coin fever. For those who believe in the long-term blend of pop culture, crypto, and collectibility, PENGU is a sleeping giant. A $3,000 stake today could be worth six figures well before the year ends—especially if it gets picked up by major exchanges and influencers. dogwifhat (WIF): The People’s Dog Coin That Won’t Stop Dogwifhat, at $0.85 with a $855 million market cap, is a Solana meme coin with a dog-in-a-hat vibe. Analysts predict $2 by Q4, a 135% gain, driven by Solana’s DeFi growth and viral marketing. WIF’s 998 million token supply and NFT integrations add staying power. Its community and Solana’s speed make it a top hold for 2025’s bull run. Given how much crypto thrives on absurdity, WIF is the coin that benefits most from pure fun. If it makes another parabolic move like it did last cycle, it could be the next DOGE for Gen-Z investors. At the right entry point, WIF could also turn $3,000 into $300,000—especially if it goes viral again and triggers FOMO across Solana and Ethereum communities. Final Thoughts: One Meme Market, Three Massive Opportunities BONK proved that meme coins are still alive and thriving, but it may have also reached its peak. For investors seeking the next 100x gem, the smart move is to shift their focus toward newer, more explosive contenders. Little Pepe brings innovation, launchpad utility, and unmatched presale entry potential. Pudgy Penguins blends viral branding and crypto culture into a uniquely powerful narrative. dogwifhat captures the unpredictable charm that fuels meme coin supercycles. All three are poised to dominate July through October 2025—and if history repeats, $3,000 could very realistically become $300,000 or more in just 15 weeks. In meme season, timing is everything. And right now, LILPEPE, PENGU, and WIF are perfectly positioned for a breakout.

CONL may provide traders with exceptional exposure to bitcoin due to Coinbase's brokerage and lending operations. The ETF is highly liquid with over $1 billion AUM and robust trading volume, creating a viable vehicle for active traders. Given strong historical performance and minimal value decay, I rate CONL a BUY for traders seeking aggressive, short-term COIN exposure. The GraniteShares 2x Long COIN Daily ETF ( CONL ) is a leveraged trading strategy designed to provide traders with 2x the daily performance of Coinbase Global ( COIN ). COIN share performance is relatively correlated to the performance of bitcoin, given the significant exposure to bitcoin transactions Coinbase inherently holds. TradingView In short, Coinbase offers a variety of financial services as a cryptocurrency brokerage platform, including bitcoin collateralized loans. These features may create a certain leveraged-like revenue stream for Coinbase, resulting in substantial relative performance to bitcoin over a long holding period. TradingView CONL does not directly invest in COIN shares, but rather, provides exposure entirely through the use of swap contracts. As a swap payer , CONL receives the daily performance of COIN while paying a fixed rate, providing leveraged exposure to the underlying stock. CONL holds a 200% position by weight in COIN swaps. Because of the daily settlement of the swap options, CONL performance will reflect that of the swaps and reset daily, resulting in the 2x target performance only being applicable to daily performance. Longer holding periods may result in a compounding effect for CONL investors, potentially resulting in excess gains or losses to the performance of COIN shares. Comparing the 1-month performance between CONL and COIN shares, CONL’s performance has exceeded the 2x daily target, exhibiting the compounding effect to the upside. TradingView Downside risk can also be amplified during extended holding periods tied to the downside performance of the underlying stock. Investors must remain cautious if seeking to hold CONL for an extended period, as consecutive days of downside risk can result in substantial losses to a position in CONL. TradingView Looking at performance since inception, CONL does not exhibit a substantial level of value decay often realized across the leveraged ETF space. Though past performance shouldn’t be indicative of the future, I believe the market depth and underlying performance of COIN shares have supported relative strength in CONL. TradingView Looking at the ETF components, CONL provides substantial depth for traders to actively manage a position. CONL has $1.02b in assets under management with an average of 7.64mm shares trading hands on a daily basis. This should provide traders with a liquid market for entering and exiting a position, minimizing cost-in/cost-out risk. CONL has a relatively high fee when compared to peer leveraged ETFs of 110bps. It is typical for leveraged strategies to command higher fees and given the market depth, I do not believe a few extra basis points on the fee should be a determining factor for trading this strategy. Seeking Alpha Risks Related to Leveraged Strategies There are inherent risks in investing in leveraged strategies. Because these strategies are meant to achieve their stated multiple over the underlying index on a daily basis, holding these strategies beyond a single day can lead to skewed performance, especially following consecutive days of upside or downside risk. This can lead to a compounding effect as well as value decay as a result of the daily reset in the derivatives positions. Leveraged strategies also add an extra layer of risk to amplified downside potential. For example, if the underlying index were to appreciate by 2% in a single day, a 3x strategy would appreciate by 6%, meaning that an investment of $100 would increase to $106. If the following day results in a -2% decline in the underlying index, or a -6% decline in the leveraged strategy, the investment will decline to $99.64. Holding leveraged strategies for longer than a single day can lead to a compounding effect on one’s position, potentially leading to significant skews from the intended multiplier. During multiple days of downside risk, an investor can experience significant value decay, potentially resulting in the inability to recover losses. Liquidity must be considered prior to investing in a leveraged fund strategy. Given that these funds are designed to be traded daily, trading volumes must be considered to ensure that cost-in/cost-out isn’t deteriorated by spreads. Traders must also consider additional taxes on short-term capital gains as well as trading fees prior to considering a leveraged trading strategy. You can review additional risks here . Before making a trading or investment decision in leveraged strategies, be sure to fully understand your risk profile and set a trading mandate to manage these risks. I believe preemptively setting parameters for selling out of a position is prudent in ensuring that an investor appropriately manages downside risk. Final Thoughts CONL provides traders with an appealing wrapper for amplifying returns on COIN shares on a daily basis. Taking into consideration historical performance and minimal deviation from the target multiple over COIN shares, I believe CONL may be an appealing ETF for those seeking higher risk exposure. I am recommending CONL with a BUY rating.",COIN|CONL,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-07-13 11:23:35

However, it is essential to evaluate the performance of crypto trading platforms as they play significant roles in the growth of the space. A report by the market intelligence platform CryptoQuant has analyzed the growth of top players, including Binance, Coinbase, Bybit, OKX, and Bitget. The analysis checks their performance across the spot, futures, derivatives, and regional markets. CryptoQuant also gauged their level of on-chain activity. How Did Exchanges Fare in H1? The result of the analysis revealed that Binance and Coinbase are currently leading the exchange landscape across different verticals. Binance emerged as the most dominant and multifaceted crypto exchange. The platform leads in spot volume, stablecoin reserves, futures, trading, capital inflows, and user activity across multiple networks. Coinbase led as a strong institutional platform, particularly in Ethereum network usage and reserve size. However, the firm’s overall trading activity and market coverage stayed relatively conservative. As mid-tier exchanges, the reserve sizes, inflow dominance, and altcoin user activity of Bybit, OKX, and Bitget stayed below the top-tier platforms. The trio competed in derivatives and Ethereum stablecoin flows, as well as regional user activity. On-chain activity indicated that users preferred Binance, as the exchange led in both altcoin deposit and withdrawal transactions. The exchange also saw high asset rotation during market rallies. Additionally, Binance recorded the highest number of USDT transactions on the Tron network. Binance Dominates Spot and Futures Markets As the leading spot exchange, Binance accounted for a 42% share (roughly $2 trillion) of the total centralized spot trading volume. CryptoQuant said the platform led in both Bitcoin and altcoin trading. Crypto.com and Bybit followed suit with respective volumes of $800 billion and $450 billion, evenly distributed between Bitcoin and altcoins. Furthermore, Binance led the Bitcoin futures market by a wide margin, accounting for $4.1 trillion in perpetual futures volume. This represents 38% of the global market share. Bitget, Bybit, and OKX followed with 19.3% ($2.1 trillion), 16.8% ($1.82 trillion), and 16.7% ($1.81 trillion). Other exchanges accounted for less than 10%. Once again, Binance led in stablecoin reserves among the top 10 centralized exchanges, with 59.65% market share ($31.67 billion). OKX and Coinbase came next , with 15% and 11%, respectively, while the rest held reserve shares below 6%. On a broader scale, Coinbase held the highest crypto reserves, $123 billion (31.2%) in bitcoin, ether, TetherUSD, and USD Coin. Combined with Binance, both entities held about 60% of all reserves. Only Bitfinex held up to 12.3% – other exchanges accounted for less than 6% each. Finally, Coinbase emerged as the exchange with the highest on-chain activity, with more than 17 million transactions. Binance followed with approximately 13 million transactions.

Phase 5 of Mutuum Finance presale is over 65% sold out. Over 13100 investors have invested in the presale of Mutuum Finance. Already, it has raised over $12.1 million. While the Solana ETF speculation fuels institutional chatter, Mutuum Finance is quietly building momentum on-chain, positioning itself as a high-conviction play among savvy traders watching for the next breakout token. Solana Eyes Institutional Exposure Amid ETF Momentum Solana (SOL), trading around $156.76, is gaining traction as a potential spot ETF target, analysts have spotted a bullish bull flag technical pattern with projections into the $300 range if U.S. regulatory momentum continues. The SEC has pressed issuers like Fidelity to revise and refile by late July, suggesting a possible pre-October approval timeline. Meanwhile, the REX‑Osprey SOL + Staking ETF (SSK) has launched under a different legal structure and accumulated over $40 million in inflows, signaling growing investor interest while shining a spotlight on Solana-related investment products. With ETF filings advancing and on‑chain activity surging, SOL is positioned at a pivotal inflection point, muting the hype while focusing attention on fundamentals, and yes, we’ll revisit Mutuum Finance later. Leading Market Players Eye Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance is having remarkable success in Phase 5 presale. The project distinguishes itself from the rest by offering a finance system that is scalable and has a real-world practical use case. There is increased demand for investment due to the fact that the project has surpassed over $12.1 million and has over 13100 token holders.

Markets had started growing complacent to Trump’s threats, but his latest revelations could change that. Trump insists he will implement more levies on Japan, South Korea, Canada, Brazil, Algeria, and other trading partners, calling on them to negotiate deals. Trump warns that any retaliation will lead to higher levies Bankers and executives, including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, cautioned against the growing market complacency. However, investors remained adamant, believing the US president would back down on the levies as he had done previously. Meanwhile, Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, has told investors not to count on Trump dropping his 30% tariff threat on the EU. He called the tariffs “punitive” but claimed they would harm the EU more than the US, hinting that Trump may not necessarily stop them . So far, Mexico’s government has called the levies unfair and stressed its independence and sovereignty as a country. On the other hand, the EU Commission’s chief, Ursula von der Leyen, responded with a warning of reciprocal action . Despite the mounting tensions, both remain open to further negotiations with Washington. In a letter addressed Friday to the European Commission President, he detailed that despite years of dialogue, the US-EU trade relationship remains unbalanced, defined by persistent deficits. While addressing Mexico, President Trump acknowledged their cooperation on border security but remarked, “Mexico has been helping me secure the border. BUT, what Mexico has done is not enough,” hence the 30% tariffs. In both correspondences, however, he clarified that retaliatory actions would prompt the US to raise tariffs even further. Meanwhile, speaking in a Fox News segment that aired on Saturday, the US President noted that several countries were enraged with his decision, but defended the tariffs, claiming they were bringing vast sums of revenue into the country. The EU has been a target for Trump’s tariffs since April. He initially proposed a 20% levy on goods from the bloc and other trade partners, before later threatening to increase it to 50% as negotiations broke down. Investors react differently compared to when Trump announced his April tariffs Major cryptocurrencies have fallen slightly since Trump’s tariff announcement. Bitcoin , the top crypto asset by market capitalization, slipped 0.6% from its European session peak of $118,200. Ether (ETH) also declined, trading 1% lower on the day at $2,930 (UTC), while Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) dropped over 2%. Moreover, the BNB token fell 0.7%. Only XRP gained close to 2% among leading crypto assets after the announcement. Despite the crypto losses, Wall Street investors are proving hard to scare. In Trump’s tariff notices to his trading allies, he reportedly left room for adjustments that could reduce the rates, and urged his allies to negotiate for better deals. According to Jacobsen, this has calmed some of the investors’ concerns about the tariff situation. He commented, “As usual, there are many conditions and clauses that can get these rates reduced. That’s probably why the market might not like the tariff talk, but it’s not panicking about it either.” When Trump announced the first batch of reciprocal tariffs in April, the market reacted frantically by selling some of their assets and US treasuries. However, with this round of tariffs, they seem more relaxed, as the president paused all his earlier levies, and they strongly believe he will do the same this time round. Trump’s setting of the deadline for negotiation on August 1 has not even deterred the markets. However, stocks dwindled marginally on Friday when Trump increased his trade offensive.

It’s worth noting that the cryptocurrency market has been anticipating an altcoin season following sustained Bitcoin ( BTC ) dominance, which culminated in the maiden digital currency trading at a high of $118,000. Zeberg based his projection on the development of “wave III of wave 3 of wave C” in most altcoins, he said in an X post on July 12. I think we will see a monster move in wide range of Alts this coming week. We got wave iii of wave 3 of wave C developing in various Alts. Let's see how this tweet will age 😉 — Henrik Zeberg (@HenrikZeberg) July 12, 2025 The waves reference Elliott Wave Theory, which traders use to analyze market psychology and price trends. In this framework, Wave 3 is typically the strongest, with Wave iii representing an especially powerful sub-phase of acceleration. Ethereum to lead altcoin rally He also noted that Ethereum ( ETH ) is already showing the expected breakout and is likely to lead the broader altcoin rally. This behavior is typical of altcoin seasons, when capital rotates out of Bitcoin into smaller cryptocurrencies, amplifying gains across the market. To this end, the expert expects Ethereum to rise further before a summer lull, a period when crypto trading often slows. However, he warned that the rally could be followed by a sharp pullback later in the season, suggesting traders should prepare for significant volatility. At press time, the second-ranked cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at $2,955, down 0.6% in the last 24 hours. In the past week, ETH has rallied 17%. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency trading expert Michaël van de Poppe observed in a July 12 X post that Bitcoin dominance is weakening, with a clear bearish divergence emerging. Historically, such patterns have signaled short-term reversals and triggered rallies in altcoins. Altcoin market analysis chart. Source: TradingView Key support around 54% to 55% is now in focus, and a confirmed drop below this level could drive a rotation into altcoins over the next one to two weeks, as traders seek higher returns outside of Bitcoin. Altcoin market cap flashing bullish signals Additionally, pseudonymous analyst El_crypto_prof, in an X post on July 13, highlighted growing altcoin optimism, noting that the TOTAL3 index (which tracks the altcoin market cap excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum) is flashing a bullish signal. In this case, the weekly MACD has made a bullish cross, a move that has historically marked the start of strong altcoin rallies. Altcoin market analysis chart.

Key Takeaways: Animoca Brands partners with DayDayCook to manage up to $100 million in Bitcoin reserves. Companies increasingly use Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a long-term store of value. Institutional Bitcoin holdings surged in Q2 2025. The agreement, a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) announced Thursday , marks a significant step in the growing trend of corporate Bitcoin treasury management. Under the deal, Animoca plans to allocate up to $100 million worth of Bitcoin to DDC for management. Animoca Brands Partnership Comes as Bitcoin Gains Ground as Treasury The partnership reflects an emerging wave of companies integrating Bitcoin into their treasury strategies as a hedge against inflation and a long-term store of value. DayDayCook first revealed its Bitcoin treasury ambitions in May, announcing a target purchase of 5,000 BTC over three years. The company made an initial move by acquiring 21 BTC for its corporate treasury in the same month. This aligns with a broader corporate shift toward Bitcoin adoption, as firms seek to diversify and protect their assets amid economic uncertainty. While the rise of Bitcoin treasury companies signals growing mainstream acceptance, it has also sparked debate among investors. Some see these entities as critical drivers for wider adoption, while others warn of the risks posed by overleveraged firms that could exacerbate market downturns.

DDC already holds 368 BTC, up 48.3% since mid-June pic.twitter.com/xoUJsNuymy — Crypto Rose Channel (@rosycutee2) July 13, 2025 Data from BitcoinTreasuries shows 268 institutions currently hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, spanning public companies, private firms, government bodies, asset managers, and crypto-focused enterprises. Public companies make up the largest segment, accounting for 147 of these holders. The second quarter of 2025 saw these treasury companies add 159,107 BTC, valued at over $18.7 billion, marking a 23% increase in acquisitions from the previous quarter. Blockstream CEO Adam Back described this trend as a “new altseason ,” urging traders to shift investments into Bitcoin or Bitcoin treasuries. Analysts Warn of Risks Ahead for Bitcoin Treasury Companies However, despite the enthusiasm, caution persists. Analysts warn many treasury companies may falter when Bitcoin prices fall or when access to affordable corporate financing tightens, potentially leading to significant market corrections. Last week, Glassnode lead analyst James Check raised concerns over the longevity of the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, arguing the easy gains might already be gone for new entrants as the market matures. The warning echoes recent comments from Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, who has voiced concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms. Sigel singled out the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, arguing that these can become dilutive if a company’s stock price nears its Bitcoin net asset value (NAV).

In a new interview with CNBC Television, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan says that blue-chip institutions having increasing demand for BTC mixed with its limited supply could push the value of Bitcoin by about 70% from current prices. “There’s unrelenting demand from corporations and institutional investors, and that’s colliding with severely limited supply. You know the Bitcoin network only produces 450 Bitcoin per day. Yesterday alone, Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) bought 10,000 Bitcoin. This institutional investment into Bitcoin is a one-time event. It’s going to take years to play out. But I think over the course of those years, there’s going to be this persistent bid where there’s more demand than there is supply. And the natural response to that is what we’re seeing in the market, which is Bitcoin’s price goes higher. I think it has a long way to go. I think it could end the year closer to $200,000. So I would get used to this story of new all-time highs.” Hougan adds that interest in Bitcoin’s use cases is growing, particularly amid rising geopolitical uncertainty. “Bitcoin provides a service which is the ability to store wealth in a digital format without relying on a bank. The vibes are definitely part of it. Vibes influence stocks. They influence bonds, but the underlying driver for the rise is more people want this service that Bitcoin provides. In this uncertain world, where there are tariffs and geopolitical tensions, people want to be able to own their wealth in a digital format.” Bitcoin is trading for $117,470 at time of writing, a marginal decrease on the day.

Over the past few days, XRP has posted several green candles in a row, showing the rising buying pressure in the market. XRP often makes sharp moves once momentum kicks in: either upward or downward. Right now, XRP is clearly in an upward trend, and it recently broke through a key resistance area between $2.55 and $2.62. After this breakout, the next big target for XRP is sitting between $2.80 and $3.00. However, one concern is that XRP is currently in overbought territory on the daily timeframe. This means that while the price is strong, it could face some pullback or slowdown before attempting another big jump. What’s Next for XRP Price? If XRP can successfully break and hold above $3 in the coming days, it could quickly surge toward its all-time high range between $3.30 and $3.40. Historically, XRP has shown a tendency to move fast when it gains momentum and this time might not be different. If the price struggles around $2.90 to $3.00, support is expected to come back in between $2.55 and $2.62, which was previously a strong resistance zone. As long as the price stays above these levels, the overall outlook for XRP remains bullish. An expert explained that XRP formed a strong support zone around $1.90, creating a triple bottom pattern. This was followed by an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which helped push the price up. After breaking important resistance levels at $2.33 and $2.32, XRP surged close to $3.00. Right now, the price is pulling back near $2.77, but if this support level holds, the upward trend could continue.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-13 11:53:13

Notably, the altcoin gained by nearly 10% in the last seven days as general crypto prices surged, pushing its unit price into the $160 price region. Amidst the present market cool-off, Ali Martinez has tipped Solana to embark on a parabolic rally subject to a particular market condition. Related Reading: Why The Solana Price Could Crash To $95 Before Reaching $200 Solana Bulls Eye Breakout As $170 Emerges As Critical Resistance In an X post on July 12, Martinez outlines a bullish technical analysis on the Solana market, stating the altcoin is at a key price juncture. Using the weekly chart, the analyst has been able to identify a mega cup-and-handle pattern, which usually precedes a major price rally. However, the altcoin faces a critical price resistance at the $170 region. For context, the cup-and-handle pattern is a popular bullish chart formation that indicates potential for significant price upswings. As seen in the chart below, it resembles the shape of a teacup, commencing with a bearish market, followed by a price recovery of equal magnitude as seen between the start of 2022 and the start of 2025. During this period, investors saw Solana prices crash from around $250 to a cycle low of $9.88 before experiencing a gradual return to a similar peak, thereby forming the cup pattern. Thereafter, SOL has experienced significant price corrections and rebounds, eventually creating a descending price pattern that represents the handle of this formation. Notably, the cup-and-handle pattern only translates into a price surge following a decisive price breakout above the formation’s neckline. Following recent gains, Solana finds itself within touching distance of this neckline at the $170 price mark. Martinez explains that a successful weekly close above this major resistance will validate the bullish intentions on Solana, inducing a heavy market demand and paving the path for higher price territories. Based on the Fibonacci retracement and extension levels on the chart, the initial price target in the event of this breakout is set at $295, instantly matching the current all-time high. However, the historical magnitude of breakouts from cup-and-handle pattern points to lofty price targets, such as $ $787, $1,314, and a max target of $2,744. However, a rejection at $170 may force Solana to visit lower support levels near $135 or even $100, which has served as a major demand zone in the past.

Ethereum (ETH) recently surged past the $3,000 mark, a key psychological level that many traders have been eyeing for months. And with that move, talk of a possible altcoin season has quickly returned. So, what’s driving this sudden surge? According to analyst Evan Aldo , it’s a mix of factors. The market has been expecting U.S. interest rate cuts later this year, and with inflation numbers cooling down, risk assets like crypto are bouncing back. On top of that, rare bullish patterns on Ethereum’s monthly chart has reignited hope, giving many reasons to believe this breakout could stick around longer than previous ones. But it’s not just Ethereum in the spotlight. Solana (SOL) has also been on a tear, recently surpassing Ethereum and Tron in Q2 blockchain revenue. Its price has steadily climbed, with the analyst predicting it could test $188 in the coming weeks, and possibly stretch to $250–$260 by mid-August if momentum continues. The analyst said that it could reach $400 by the end of the year if market conditions remain favorable. On the other hand, Avalanche (AVAX) has been a bit slower to catch up but is showing early signs of recovery. New developments in its ecosystem, including the launch of BlackHole DEX, have helped boost user activity. If AVAX holds key support levels, it could aim for $32 in the short term and possibly between $60 to $100 by the end of the year. When asked where they’d invest if starting fresh today, the expert advised putting 70% into Ethereum, with 15% each in Solana and Avalanche. Their reasoning? Ethereum looks set to outperform for the next few months, while Solana and Avalanche might take the lead in the final quarter of 2025.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,MARKET|ETH|SOL|AVAX|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-13 12:10:52

This week’s most notable news is that Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, trading above $116,000, which has pushed El Salvador’s holdings to over $722 million, peaking at $726 million at one point. Argentina, on the other hand, continues to move forward with its plans to tokenise assets such as lithium reserves in San Juan, using the Cardano blockchain. El Salvador doubles down on Bitcoin amid new all-time high Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, trading above $116,000, which has pushed El Salvador’s holdings to over $722 million, peaking at $726 million at one point. Despite strong criticism from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has urged the country to reduce its BTC purchases in exchange for a $1.4 billion loan agreement, El Salvador continues to expand its Bitcoin portfolio. Holding 6,234 BTC, the government sees the cryptocurrency as more than an investment—it’s a tool for financial inclusion and independence from traditional banking systems. Since making Bitcoin legal tender in 2021, El Salvador has adopted the cryptocurrency to reduce remittance costs, increase economic autonomy, and protect its citizens from inflation. While the policy remains contentious, particularly among institutions such as the IMF, the Bukele administration is steadfast in its confidence that Bitcoin will drive the country’s economic destiny. As Bitcoin’s bullish trend continues, El Salvador’s holdings may climb higher, cementing the country’s pioneering role in global cryptocurrency adoption. Argentina leads lithium tokenisation with blockchain innovation In a ground-breaking move, Paraguayan firm Atómico3 and Taiwan’s Hua Lian Mining have collaborated to tokenise lithium reserves in San Juan, Argentina, via the Cardano blockchain. This endeavour represents a significant step toward combining traditional mining and blockchain technology, allowing lithium assets to be represented as digital currencies. These coins will be available to both institutional and retail investors, enhancing transparency, traceability, and access to funding for renewable energy projects. Argentina has established itself as a mining-tech pioneer in Latin America by converting physical lithium reserves into digital assets. The tokenisation process comprises reserve certification, smart contract implementation, and blockchain connectivity to provide security and transparency. This strategy not only permits global investment but also promotes sustainability and decentralised governance, paving the way for other lithium-rich countries such as Chile, Peru, and Bolivia. USDC expands B2B reach with new partnerships in Brazil Circle, the firm behind the USDC stablecoin, has announced a cooperation with HiFi Bridge to facilitate cross-border B2B transfers between the United States, Brazil, and Hong Kong. HiFi, an API platform meant to ease company payments, has been integrated into the Circle Payments Network. This move follows a similar attempt in June when Coinbase collaborated with Brazilian fintech Matera to offer USDC transactions via PIX, signalling the early adoption of digital payments in the region. In 2024, the worldwide B2B payments sector generated more than $905 billion, with the United States contributing $160 billion to Latin America. Brazil alone got $330 million in remittances in May 2025. Visa has also joined the field with Kob Visa, reporting 30x transaction growth and an estimated $85 trillion B2B market. Meanwhile, Drex, Brazil’s digital currency experiment, shows promise in real estate tokenisation, with authorities praising its ability to improve efficiency and transparency.

According to reports, the firm, which acts as an investment platform, suffered a shortfall worth millions of pounds. Administrators mentioned that they discovered a £2 million black hole at Ziglu, which suspended withdrawals in May and was put into special administration last week. The company was once the cynosure of the investment community, attracting users due to its market-beating rates. At the time, the company was said to have been valued at around £126 million. However, it all came crashing down when about 20,000 users on its platform had their funds frozen after the Financial Conduct Authority ( FCA ), the body that oversees financial integrity in the United Kingdom, ordered it to suspend withdrawals. The directors at the company were accused of mismanaging funds belonging to users at a court last week where it was revealed that they had used users’ funds to keep the business running until it collapsed. British crypto firm Ziglu collapses after mismanaging users’ funds According to reports, a High Court insolvency hearing was told that funds that users saved in the British fintech firm’s high-interest investment product had been used more as a general cash flow than what it was intended for. The company then applied to be put into administration in June after it looked like it could not carry on with the practice. Funds belonging to its users were frozen in May after the FCA restricted withdrawals from its Boost Product, which offered users interest rates at unbeatable prices. The collapse will likely draw new questions from participants and onlookers about the promise of the high-stakes crypto industry, which promises huge returns without the traditional protections. Ziglu was founded by former Sterling Bank co-founder Mark Hipperson. The platform allowed users to store, save, and send cryptocurrencies. According to the company, it wanted to empower everyone to benefit from the new world of cryptocurrency, allowing users to save and use digital money easily, safely, and affordably. The main feature of the company was its Boost investment products, which offered returns of up to 6pc. The product was launched in 2021, when interest rates were very low, attracting savers who were desperate to see returns on their investments. However, Ziglu suspended users from withdrawing from their Boost funds in May. Customers may not be able to recover their funds According to the company, about 4,000 users used the investment product, with a total balance of up to £2.7 million. The £2 million shortfall means that if the funds are not recovered as part of the rescue deal, the majority of their funds will be wiped out. Millions of pounds in separate deposits and withdrawals belonging to users are still accounted for, although it remains unknown when they will gain access to their funds. In June, customers were given a week to withdraw their funds before the company went into administration. However, the Boost Product did not have the same protection as a typical savings account. According to its terms, the company could use the funds for day-to-day operations and generate returns by lending them out. Ziglu allegedly used customer funds earlier this year after an investment fell through. Mr Hipperson, who recently left the company, mentioned that Ziglu’s board and advisers had been close to closing a deal for new funding before the restrictions went into effect. He said the investment would have ensured that Boost savers were made whole. The administrators of the firm will now start looking for new buyers as the future of savers’ funds remains unclear. United States Fintech firm Robinhood was close to securing a $170 million deal for Ziglu in 2022 as part of its plan to enter the United Kingdom. However, things failed to materialize after the downturn in the crypto market forced them to cut the price before they eventually pulled out of the deal. “We cannot comment on specific firms. We continue to remind people that while we develop the UK’s crypto regulation, crypto remains largely unregulated in the UK and high risk,” an FCA spokesperson said.

According to the Northern District of California’s U.S. Attorney’s Office, Sixto Christopher Porras allegedly stole approximately $440,000 from two retail bank customers while stationed in San Francisco. In each of the cases, Porras managed to drain the bank accounts using the customer’s existing debit cards or replacements. The first incident occurred in August of 2023 after a customer walked into the bank to conduct a wire transfer, according to the Northern District of California’s U.S. Attorney’s Office. “As the transfer was processed, Porras obtained from the customer the security personal identification number associated with the customer’s debit card. Unbeknownst to the customer, Porras kept the customer’s debit card. Porras allegedly proceeded to use the debit card to embezzle approximately $100,000 from the customer’s account.” The second incident took place about a month later. “In or about September 2023, another retail bank customer visited the branch to address a fraudulent charge. As Porras assisted the customer, he obtained the security PIN associated with the customer’s debit card. Porras then caused the customer’s debit card to be reissued and sent to Porras’ San Francisco residence. Porras allegedly proceeded to use the debit card to embezzle approximately $340,000 from the customer’s accounts.” Porras, who currently no longer works with the unnamed bank, is now facing charges of embezzlement of bank funds and access device fraud. For the embezzlement charge, Porras could get a maximum of up to 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine if convicted. The access device fraud charge carries a maximum of 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted.

Companies such as Ripple, Circle, and BitGo have applied for national trust bank charters, which would allow them to offer select banking services. Meanwhile, crypto exchange Kraken plans to release both debit and credit cards by the end of the month. Kraken’s co-CEO Arjun Sethi called this shift a “natural convergence,” reflecting the growing confidence within the industry. Unlike under the previous administration, many now see the current U.S. leadership as supportive of digital asset innovation. Circle sees a trust bank charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) as a major step toward integrating crypto into the mainstream financial system. Currently, Anchorage Digital is the only crypto firm with such a charter. This status lets companies handle payments and asset custody across all states, without needing separate licenses in each one. Crypto’s embrace of regulation marks a major shift. “It’s a 180,” said Max Bonici of Davis Wright Tremaine, noting how crypto companies once aimed to operate outside traditional finance but now seek oversight to gain trust and reach. The timing aligns with pending legislation like the Genius Act , which aims to regulate stablecoins more strictly. The law would require that only OCC-approved banks or similar groups issue stablecoins, and back them with U.S. Treasuries. Ripple has also applied for a Federal Reserve master account to hold reserves for its stablecoin plans. Robinhood, which earned much of its recent revenue from crypto trading, will offer banking services later this year. UK fintech Revolut and Swedish lender Klarna are also eyeing deeper moves into crypto-finance. Even major banks like Bank of America are exploring stablecoins, waiting on clearer regulation before launching their own. However, some players like Kraken don’t intend to become full-service banks. Instead, they prefer to partner with existing providers to offer select services without needing a bank license.",,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-07-13 12:50:56

Real-world tokenized assets hit $25B; Bitwise says this could scale with institutional interest. BlackRock’s CEO sees tokenization as the future—Bitwise says exposure now could prove decisive. Tokenization Attracts Attention from Top Firms Bitwise Asset Management has named Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Chainlink (LINK) as top choices for exposure to tokenization. The firm sees these blockchains as the most practical bets in a growing narrative. Demand is rising for on-chain versions of stocks, bonds, and other traditional assets. In the past month, several developments have pushed tokenization into focus. Robinhood and Kraken rolled out tokenized stock trading for non-U.S. users. Coinbase has filed to offer similar services in the U.S. Institutions Begin to Move In Bitwise analysts noted that tokenization is no longer just a theory. The total value of tokenized real-world assets recently reached $25 billion. In Latin America, Mercado Bitcoin plans to tokenize $200 million on the XRP Ledger. Galaxy Digital has also flagged tokenization as a possible threat to the revenue models of traditional exchanges like the NYSE. Regulators have started to acknowledge the shift. SEC Chair Paul Atkins called tokenization an important “innovation.” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in his annual letter: “Every stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized.” According to Bitwise, ETH is the current leader. Still, Solana, XRP, and LINK offer unique advantages. Solana has low-cost transactions, XRP is gaining traction in Latin America, and LINK provides the data infrastructure behind asset tracking and pricing. Together, they cover different layers of the ecosystem. “Ethereum is ahead today, but the space is still open,” the analysts wrote. “It would be unfortunate to bet on the trend early and pick the wrong horse.” Market Size Could Power Long-Term Growth The value of global stock and bond markets stands at $257 trillion. Even if just 1% moves on-chain, it could unlock trillions in value. This dwarfs projections for the stablecoin market, which may grow from $250 billion to $2 trillion by 2030. “If Larry Fink is right, tokenization could grow over 4,000x,” Bitwise said. Consequently, the firm recommends combining blockchain exposure with public companies like Robinhood or Coinbase for broader access.

Congrats, Bitcoin! This milestone highlights Bitcoin's continued strength alongside the broader stock market rally. However, stocks were flat while BTC rallied 8% this week. I break down the 1 year and 1 month charts for BTC, including trends, support and resistance levels, and momentum and strength indicators. There are bearish signals in one chart and bullish signals in the other, confirming a pattern I am seeing form across high-beta and risk-on assets. I consider it very bullish. Consider not only if and at what price one should enter the trade, but also how — we have many tools available to use now in how to hold BTC. I discuss several options (including options). Introduction We are once again at a new historic moment for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Alongside the stock market, BTC is reaching new highs, breaking $119,000 on July 11th, 2025, even if for just a moment. This marks Bitcoin's new all-time high, and rounds out a 25% gain YTD for BTC, and an even larger change from the bottom Bitcoin found in April. Data by YCharts This comes after a killer near 8% week, and a rally in Bitcoin that came on the heels of the passage of the Big Beautiful Bill from the week prior. Interestingly enough, this breakout from Bitcoin didn't follow US markets, which were flat over the same time. Actually, Bitcoin has been decoupling a lot lately, though it was still very correlated in the crash back in April. It has its moments. Data by YCharts The decoupling of Bitcoin from markets is a great sign, as it frees up Bitcoin to keep moving in its own direction in the coming weeks. Even if markets stay flat, or even fall, could Bitcoin keep this momentum up? Let's see what the charts say. Bitcoin Technical Analysis First, it should be of note that I've been seeing the same pattern in many charts lately , due to the correlation between high-beta assets. While Bitcoin can decouple from time to time, it overall has kept up with beta overall this past year. So I won't be talking about the inverse head and shoulders pattern I see, but you can read about that in the article linked above. I see it more in the Nasdaq 100 chart than I do here, anyway. Bitcoin didn't get the same volume boost at the breakout, but it did get the breakout. That's what brought us here, to our new all-time high. BTC One-Year Chart Here's the one-year chart I'm looking at, legend at the top of the image: Barchart There are a few things that stand out to me here: Trend since April low has been clearly upwards. Confirmed by higher highs and higher lows. Here is April-July in daily candles. Barchart We saw our first breakout in November, following the election hype. 200 EMA (maroon line) mostly held during March and April lows, indicating strong structural support around that level. Mid-June showed us the breakout cleanly above the psychological $100K barrier. Momentum gauges like RSI, MACD, and PPO are all bullish currently, showing some of the strongest momentum since Q4 2024. Barchart Here are the current support levels we can chart out: Level Type Note $119,000 Resistance Psychological, ATH $116,000 Support Last resistance $109,700 Support 20 EMA $105,500 Support 50 EMA $100,300 Strong Support 100 EMA $92,200 Strong Support 200 EMA This is a classic breakout happening, which is bullish, especially when confirmed with strong momentum and not-overbought conditions on the RSI (yet), MACD, and PPO. That being said, we could still see some short-term pullbacks, but I expected these levels to hold barring a large market correction that could bring down Bitcoin in sympathy. Otherwise, the chart says we may have $116,000, the last technical resistance that we broke out of to hit these new highs, as a new support level for midday trading noise. Traders looking to enter Bitcoin may consider looking around these various support levels, especially if we drop to the 100 EMA, around the $100K mark. That would be a psychological battle for price that could determine bullish or bearish sentiment moving forward. However, I don't expect us to test those levels soon, and certainly not without a negative catalyst. BTC One-Month Chart Looking back just at the past month shows us a different story, one that is far more exhausted than the one-year looks. This is where that ""short term pullback"" could come from. Barchart This is a consolidation pattern, which is common following a breakout, especially with a movement as forceful and strong as this last one was. See how fast the MACD and PPO lines jumped on July 10th-11th. That's one of the ways we can see the strength of a rally, although these indicators can tend to lag at times. Most of the movement that caused them to jump started on July 9th. Zoom in on the most recent ticks; remember that these are hour candles on a one-month chart. Note how we fell firmly below the 20 EMA, which is now acting as a resistance level. Next support is at the 50 EMA, which is down at $116,300. Barchart We could easily fall to $112,000 before resuming the upward trend, but it will depend on volume. Current volume hasn't changed much since the breakout, and if anything is a bit lower since then. Momentum indicators are bearish, and the RSI is reflecting close-to oversold conditions, but still has room to fall if consolidation continues. Barchart The positives about this chart is that it is showing us a very small bull flag around the consolidation, and this may be a textbook case of ""refueling,"" or buyer demand falling off after a breakout. That is usually a bullish signal to buy now, though I am hesitant to ever recommend buying anything at all-time highs. Bitcoin Investment Strategy For those holding BTC outright or through ETFs like IBIT, I would suggest continuing to hold. This may be a great opportunity, but I don't know if I add here. Personally, I am not adding to my position in Bitcoin because I am happy with my current allocation. This take doesn't mean I'm not bullish, and so I am still giving Bitcoin a buy rating here, but I just happened to have already bought (long) before I wrote this piece. I am right-sized currently, and suggest others consider their risk tolerance carefully, as Bitcoin is incredibly volatile. For those looking to buy in now, entry point matters. I would look for a pullback to the $110k-105k region, testing the 20 EMA and the 50 EMA. This may come on the back of the short-term weakness I see in the one-month chart, and I expect us to see increased intraday volatility as we test new highs. Those trading days will likely provide some solid entry points. For options traders, this breakout is likely to come with volatility, and we're already seeing IV push up. Long calls are risky due to currently high IV, as a prolonged pullback from here could deflate IV and crush options pricing. Short puts far OTM, with strikes below 100 EMA (~$100k or equivalent in ETF pricing) may be attractive, but cap upside participation if the breakout is sustained as I expect. For example, here is the IBIT Dec 31st 65C (a way cheaper way to buy options on Bitcoin). Notice the elevated implied volatility (purple line) relative to the inflated price, which we should expect either way since the underlying asset has run up to all-time highs. If IV falls back to where it was even just a few days ago, the call could rapidly lose value even if the asset stays at its current level. This phenomenon would be advantageous for options sellers, which is why I would recommend OTM short puts instead of long calls. OptionStrat How I Own BTC Personally, I don't own any actual Bitcoins anymore, as I got rid of most of the collection I had over the 2021 cycle when I felt like the bubble behavior had gotten too bad (NFTs, etc.), and the rest has become dust sitting across various wallets. It's no longer worth it to collect that, at least for now. I don't include that meaningfully in my Bitcoin allocation. Since the rise of access to derivatives and commodity-based ETFs over the last few years has changed the way people access BTC, I no longer feel the need to store them physically or with a custodian like Coinbase ( COIN ). I own them through my brokerage account now. I own Bitcoin two ways: The iShares IBIT ETF The Simplify MAXI ETF Income investors should also check out Roundhill's YBTC and NEOS' BTCI ; they're both great covered call funds covering BTC. Conclusion Ultimately, I see the possibility for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) to continue to impress, even after hitting a new all-time high on Friday. Risk-on assets are in vogue, and high beta instruments like Bitcoin are riding a generally positive wave. However, Bitcoin decoupled from stocks, which were flat last week, to run up almost 8% and set a new record. Technical analysis shows us a positive setup for Bitcoin, with the one-year chart looking far more bullish than the one-month chart. This falls in line with the general trend and pattern I am seeing, where BTC is consolidating after its breakout this past week. Consolidations may test new technical support levels, offering attractive entry points for bullish investors. I see the potential for more pain ahead, especially if stocks and other high-beta assets consolidate in the coming days, down to $110,000. However, there are several smaller barriers before then, and trading may be choppy through the summer. Long-term bullishness and short-term bearishness historically benefits buyers. Look out for opportunities, and be patient if necessary. Remember that position sizing is often more important than security selection.

However, the price has now reached a critical resistance zone near its previous swing high, increasing the likelihood of a short-term consolidation or corrective pullback. XRP Analysis By Shayanmarkets The Daily Chart XRP has successfully broken above its prolonged descending wedge pattern and the 200-day moving average, triggering an impulsive bullish surge. This breakout marked a major shift in market sentiment, with the price rapidly climbing to test the $3 resistance, which aligns with a prior major swing high. However, this critical price level is now acting as a formidable resistance, and selling pressure is beginning to emerge. As a result, a short-term consolidation or pullback is likely to unfold before any continuation of the uptrend. For Ripple to maintain its bullish structure and aim for a new all-time high, reclaiming and holding above the $3 threshold will be essential. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, XRP decisively broke above the $2.7 resistance level — a barrier that had capped price action for several months. This breakout was accompanied by strong bullish momentum, evidenced by the formation of large bullish candles. However, upon reaching the $3 resistance zone, the momentum faded, and a minor rejection followed. The asset has since retraced to retest the broken $2.7 level, forming a pullback structure. If buying interest resurfaces at this level, a fresh surge targeting the $3 mark is probable. That said, if the pullback deepens, the next key support lies within the 0.5–0.618 Fibonacci retracement range, suggesting the potential for a more extended correction before the next leg upward.

The flagship cryptocurrency’s unprecedented rally sent it to record levels, with the price peaking at $118,856 on Friday. BTC raced to a new all-time high on Friday and is marginally up over the past 24 hours, trading around $117,903. The price had dipped to a low of $117,101 early on Monday before recovering and moving to current levels. Bitcoin (BTC) Investors Look Ahead To Crucial Week Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto investors head into the week betting on a slew of crucial wins for the industry that could bring new investment and capital into the asset class. The US House of Representatives is set to debate several crypto bills that could provide the crypto industry with the regulatory framework it has demanded. President Trump has promised to support the crypto industry and urged lawmakers to draft favorable policies and rules for the sector. The President himself is involved in several crypto ventures, including World Liberty Financial, run by his sons Eric and Don Jr. Congress will vote on the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, as the industry’s recently strained ties with Washington continue to thaw. Jag Kooner, head of derivatives at crypto exchange Bitfinex, stated, “Even if final passage stalls, the optics of legislative engagement are bullish.” Bitcoin’s rally triggered a broader uptick in the market, with several altcoins crossing key levels. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, stated, “Investors are racing to take positions ahead of the extra publicity this event could attract.” Robert Kiyosaki Planning Another Bitcoin Buy Robert Kiyosaki, author of the best-selling Rich Dad Poor Dad, has reiterated one of his classic lessons about investor behavior and market timing, especially in terms of Bitcoin . Kiyosaki took to X to discuss investor psychology, stating, “Pigs get fat. Hogs get slaughtered. I state this lesson because I bought my latest bitcoin at $110K.” The best-selling author noted he was entering what investors call the “Banana Zone,” an explosive phase of upward price action driven by retail frenzy. The author contrasted the two types of market participants, stating, “Being a fat pig with enough bitcoin… I will wait for the coming hog slaughter. After the hogs stop squealing and selling and blaming bitcoin for their losses, my fellow pigs and I will buy more bitcoin on sale.” Kiyosaki is well-known for emphasizing long-term thinking and smart entry points when it comes to investing. The latest post emphasizes his philosophy that true gains come from patient and informed investing decisions. Retail Traders Missing Bitcoin (BTC) hit consecutive highs this week. However, retail investors are visibly absent, hesitant to jump back into the market. Despite this, demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs is surging, with Thursday and Friday recording inflows of over $1 billion, indicating that the rally is being driven by institutional investors. Bitwise head of research Andre Dragosch stated, “Bitcoin is at new all-time highs, but retail is almost nowhere to be found. Latest leg up is mostly driven by institutions.” Some market watchers speculate that retail investors believe they may have missed the boat and perceive the current price as too high to enter the market. Bitcoin commentator Lindsay Stamp stated, “I think a lot of retail folks find out the price of one Bitcoin is 117k and think, nahhh I missed the boat, and don’t even give it a second thought.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin’s (BTC) unprecedented rally has taken a breather over the weekend, as the price consolidates between $117,000 and $118,000. The flagship cryptocurrency set consecutive records this week, racing to a high of $116,393 on Thursday and $118,856 on Friday. The rally is part of a broader trend of investors embracing risk assets thanks to growing institutional interest and acceptance of digital assets like Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Inflows and market trends pushed BTC past $118,000, with over $1.4 billion in short positions liquidated. Major industry figures have predicted further upside, stability, and more institutional buying as Bitcoin treasury companies snap up the asset. Analysts expect bullish momentum to continue, with BTC continuing to push higher. Favorable macroeconomic developments next week could drive the price beyond $120,000. BTC registered a substantial increase on Wednesday (July 2), rising nearly 3% to $108,845.

A successful retest of $2.8K could ignite the next wave toward $3.3K and beyond. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart ETH has recently seen a notable influx of buying pressure, breaking above the key $2.8K resistance, which had acted as a persistent barrier in recent months. This breakout has led to the formation of a higher high, signaling a shift toward a bullish market structure on the daily timeframe. However, Ethereum now finds itself trading within a critical range between $2.8K and $3.3K, where a short-term consolidation phase is likely. The upper boundary of this range also aligns with a bearish order block, suggesting potential supply and selling pressure at this level. If Ethereum manages to break above the $3.3K resistance, the next bullish target would likely be the $4K psychological threshold, a major technical and psychological level. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, ETH’s impulsive rally has been halted near the $3K level, as momentum cools. The $2.8K zone, previously strong resistance, is now being retested as support. A proper pullback to this region would serve to validate the breakout and establish a stronger base for the next leg up. The 0.5-0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels also serve as potential targets for this ongoing correction, providing confluence with short-term demand zones. In the coming days, Ethereum is expected to consolidate and correct, potentially setting the stage for another bullish rally toward the $3.3K resistance. Sentiment Analysis By ShayanMarkets This chart visualizes the Binance Liquidation Heatmap, which pinpoints zones where significant liquidation events are likely to unfold. These areas often act as liquidity magnets, attracting price action due to the high concentration of leveraged positions. In such scenarios, large players or “whales” tend to capitalize on these zones to enter or exit trades efficiently. At present, a prominent liquidation cluster is located just below the $2.8K mark, implying a high probability that Ethereum’s price may gravitate toward this level. Should this scenario play out, ETH would complete its pullback to this key support, potentially reigniting bullish momentum and setting the stage for a rally toward the $3.3K resistance. On the flip side, another sizeable liquidity pool sits above the $3K level, indicating that following the pullback, Ethereum could also move higher in the short term to tap this zone, potentially triggering a short-squeeze and fueling further upside.

While Bitcoin bulls eye a potential surge to $250,000 subsidized by means of growing institutional adoption and international macro traits, Ozak AI keeps to benefit traction as one of the maximum discussed early-stage altcoins with its integration of artificial intelligence and decentralized records infrastructure. Bitcoin Targeting a $250K Breakout Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading above $117,000 and stays the undisputed leader of the crypto market. With the following bull cycle underway and broader popularity of BTC as a digital store of value, many analysts believe a target of $250,000 in 2025 is within reach. Factors just like the current Bitcoin ETF approvals, growing company holdings, and growing interest from institutional buyers have drastically boosted demand. The key to Bitcoin’s boom lies in its growing legitimacy amongst traditional finance players. Major asset managers now maintain exposure to BTC, and a few governments are even exploring Bitcoin-based total funding strategies. While it is able to no longer supply the equal exponential gains as smaller-cap altcoins, Bitcoin gives a level of security and predictability that many buyers nonetheless find attractive—particularly those with large portfolios searching for hedge-like belongings at some stage in financial uncertainty. Ozak AI: The $0.005 Token Targeting $1 While Bitcoin sets its sights on a potential 2x to 3x return, Ozak AI is capturing attention with its far more ambitious projection: a 200x move from its current presale price of $0.005 to $1. What sets Ozak AI apart from many other presale tokens is its real-world use case. Built around predictive AI, decentralized data vaults, and scalable infrastructure, Ozak AI is creating a platform for advanced data analytics tailored to financial markets. Its ecosystem includes the Ozak Stream Network (OSN) for real-time data flow, Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) for secure processing, and highly customizable AI agents that users can train to fit specific data analysis needs. As more institutions and traders look for competitive AI tools to enhance their decision-making, Ozak AI aims to fill that gap, offering a utility that could generate sustainable demand over time. The project has already raised over $1.3 million and is currently in Stage 4 of its presale, with growing community support and early listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. With such a low entry point, even modest adoption could push Ozak AI toward its $1 target in the coming cycle. Bitcoin and Ozak AI represent two very different investment strategies going into 2025. Bitcoin may appeal to those looking for a relatively safer store of value with a high ceiling, while Ozak AI is designed for high-risk, high-reward investors betting on disruptive innovation in the AI and crypto space. If Bitcoin does reach $250,000, it will solidify its status as a long-term global asset. But if Ozak AI hits $1, it could become one of the most legendary ROI stories of this bull run. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based crypto task that provides an innovative platform that focuses on predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized community technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to help crypto lovers and corporations make the perfect choices.

Key Takeaways: James Wynn deleted his X account after suffering nine-figure losses from risky, high-leverage crypto trades. His Bitcoin positions on Hyperliquid were liquidated multiple times, wiping out nearly all his holdings. Wynn’s dramatic downfall serves as a warning against aggressive speculation in volatile markets. His former handle, “ JamesWynnReal ,” now leads to a message stating, “This account doesn’t exist. Try searching for another.” According to blockchain data aggregated by Arkham Intelligence and Hypurrscan, Wynn’s wallets currently hold just over $10,000, a dramatic fall from his previous positions. James Wynn Changes Bio to ‘Broke’ Before Deleting Account Prior to deleting his account, Wynn updated his profile bio to a single word: “broke.” Wynn earned notoriety within crypto circles for consistently taking high-risk, high-leverage positions that often ran counter to market trends. His aggressive trading style led to losses totaling hundreds of millions. He gained particular attention for his activity on the Hyperliquid platform, where he placed some of his biggest bets. In May 2025, Wynn’s $100 million long position on Bitcoin was liquidated after the price slipped below $105,000. The wipeout resulted in the loss of 949 BTC from his holdings. Just before this collapse, Wynn admitted publicly that his approach resembled gambling more than disciplined trading, warning others not to follow his risky strategy. Despite this setback, Wynn opened another $100 million Bitcoin position days later. He claimed his positions were under attack by market makers aiming to trigger his liquidation. In a rare plea, Wynn requested donations from the crypto community to bolster his account, receiving funds from at least 24 addresses. Shortly after, Wynn liquidated 240 BTC, valued at around $25 million then, in an attempt to reduce his liquidation risk. He made $100,000,000 in unrealized profit. Lost everything. Begged for donations to avoid liquidation. Today his account got suspended. The downfall of James Wynn (1/9) pic.twitter.com/lMFKIiuc1V — StarPlatinum (@StarPlatinumSOL) July 12, 2025 Nevertheless, his efforts failed to save the remaining positions, which lost over 99% of their value. Wynn’s downfall has sparked debate among crypto investors, with many pointing to his losses as a cautionary tale. Wynn first rose to prominence by turning a $7,000 position in PEPE into $25 million. In March, Wynn began trading perpetual futures for the first time and quickly transformed a $3 million position into $100 million through aggressive high-leverage plays. Hyperliquid Hits $248 Billion Monthly Volume In May, Hyperliquid surged to a record $248 billion in trading volume, marking a 51.5% increase from April’s $187.5 billion. The growth came amid heightened market activity during the “James Wynn” trading frenzy. Year-over-year, Hyperliquid’s volume soared by 843%, jumping from $26.3 billion last May to this year’s record-breaking figure. The platform combines centralized exchange (CEX)-level user experience with non-custodial onchain infrastructure, attracting traders who want both performance and crypto-native operations. Hyperliquid’s expanding footprint is evident in its growing market share relative to Binance, the industry giant. In May, Hyperliquid accounted for 10.54% of Binance’s perpetual futures volume, up from 9.76% in April, signaling a shift in dominance within the sector. Decentralized exchange (DEX) perpetual futures also saw gains, capturing 6.84% of global perp flows in May, a rise from under 2% in 2022.

The bank also deepened its investment in Palantir Technologies, a leading AI and data analytics company. Strategic U.S. Portfolio Changes in Q2 In its latest Form 13F filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, the central bank bought 51,732 shares of Coinbase valued at over $18 million at the end of June. It also boosted its holding in Palantir by 49,135 shares to 519,950 shares. The move suggests growing confidence of the Czech National Bank in technology-related assets, especially those related to AI and blockchain. Palantir Soars after AI guidance Palantir has emerged as one of the big performers of 2025 so far, with its stock rising 80% in the first half of the year, well ahead of the S&P 500’s rise of 5.5%. The surge comes in the wake of strong earnings and increased investor demand for AI stocks. Coinbase Joins S&P 500 Despite Revenue Decline Coinbase made history in May when it became the first crypto firm to join the S&P 500. Its stock has been up around 60% in the past month with a 41% gain in H1 2025 and further 10% in recent weeks. But the company’s Q1 finances told a tale of opposites. Total revenue declined 10% to $2 billion, and net income plummeted 95% to $66 million, dragged down by nearly a $600 million unrealized crypto asset loss. But EPS was $1.94, better than forecast by analysts. Increasing Crypto Resilience Through Consolidations Even in the face of revenue headwinds, Coinbase remains busy building out its crypto offerings. In May, it agreed to acquire Deribit, an options trading platform for cryptocurrencies, for $2.9 billion. It recently also acquired Liquifi, a token management startup, strengthening its support for early-stage token projects and compliance infrastructure. Such moves reflect Coinbase’s ambitions to dominate multiple segments of the crypto space—including tokenization and derivatives—in the face of growing institutional interest.",Blockchain|Sticky|Regulation,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-07-13 14:06:45
