In his latest video update, the analyst identified ADA’s recent technical breakout as a clear sign of bullish momentum, forecasting a price target of $1.90 in the coming weeks if momentum holds. Cardano Bull Run Is Back On Investing Broz began the segment by reiterating the broader context: Bitcoin’s explosive rally above the $120,000 mark has reignited speculation around the arrival of altseason. “This is just one more egg in the basket of potentially altcoin season coming very soon,” he noted, citing Bitcoin dominance breaking below a critical support level and altcoins “going berserk.” Related Reading: Cardano Price Explodes 30% In Past Week — Analyst Calls $5 Next Market Top Among the altcoins leading the charge, Cardano stood out. The analyst confirmed that he purchased ADA in the past 24 hours, identifying the move as more than just opportunistic. The trigger? A confirmed breakout above a long-standing resistance level that ADA hadn’t pierced since March 1. “This is a major win for Cardano holders who are trading it,” he said, explaining that a falling wedge pattern had been developing for weeks and now signaled a shift in trend. Investing Broz’s trading group had initially positioned long at $0.54, with a modest target of $0.80. But as he emphasized, “Cardano is not just breaking above the smaller resistance level—we’re breaking above a resistance level we haven’t been back above since March.” That March breakout, he reminded viewers, was spurred by a now-infamous Donald Trump tweet listing altcoins deemed suitable for a proposed American crypto reserve. While that spike proved short-lived, the current breakout is, in his view, fundamentally and technically sound. To calculate a realistic upside scenario, he applied the traditional breakout target technique by measuring the height of the formation and projecting it forward. “This would give you a Cardano price prediction of $1.90,” he stated, while also noting that such a target might be ambitious for a summer timeframe. Still, “it’s absolutely doable and definitely something you guys should be keeping an eye on.” Related Reading: The Last Time This Happened Cardano Rose 55%, ADA Analyst Makes Bold The analyst reinforced his bullish outlook using confirmation from the LuxAlgo indicator suite, which flashed a weekly buy signal—featuring a green reversal, bullish momentum, and positive money flow. Based on this, he offered a more immediate price range between $1.00 and $1.80. “I don’t think we’re going to stop at $1.80, but I think it’s a target to keep an eye on if you’re looking for a trade,” he said. Beyond that, a golden pocket Fibonacci extension points to a key level of $2.42 by year’s end. However, Investing Broz was quick to clarify that these are not his full-cycle targets for ADA. “This is not my long-term bullish price prediction for this bull market,” he emphasized. “This is simply tradable movements that I still think can happen over the next couple of weeks.” His earlier predictions suggested ADA could hit $7 to $10 by the cycle top—possibly extending into 2026 or even 2027. Throughout the segment, he stressed the importance of knowing when to take profit. “Every bull market has volatility. Cardano… is going to have volatile movements where they rally and then pull back,” he advised. For short-term traders, targets around $1.80 to $2.40 may present ideal levels to secure gains or even explore short positions if momentum wanes. While ADA is not the only altcoin the analyst is tracking—Ono and HAR were also highlighted for similar breakout behavior—Cardano’s confluence of technical strength, historical resistance flip, and volume surge make it a standout in the current environment. As the analyst concluded, “There’s still time… this is a major breakout, and if you’re a trader, this is what you wait for.” Cardano, for now, has flashed its signal. Whether it makes good on the $1.90 target may depend not only on its own momentum, but on the broader timing of altseason’s long-awaited arrival. At press time, ADA stood at $0.7447.

When major economic blocs clash, the reverberations are felt across all asset classes, including the volatile crypto market. Recently, whispers of a brewing US Trade War have turned into a loud declaration, with the European Union signaling its readiness to unleash a massive wave of EU Tariffs . This isn’t just about goods and services; it’s about investor sentiment, market stability, and ultimately, the future trajectory of your digital assets. Understanding the Looming Threat of EU Tariffs The European Union, through its seasoned European Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security, Maroš Šefčovič, has made a stern announcement: a staggering 72 billion euros ($84 billion) in additional EU Tariffs are on the table. This isn’t a speculative threat but a calculated response to potential actions from the United States. The EU’s stance is clear: if trade talks with the U.S. falter, these tariffs will be imposed on U.S. imports. This substantial figure underscores the seriousness with which the EU views the escalating trade dispute, highlighting their commitment to protecting their economic interests. These potential tariffs are not merely punitive; they are a strategic measure designed to create leverage and deter aggressive trade policies from the other side. Historically, tariffs have been a double-edged sword. While intended to protect domestic industries, they often lead to higher consumer prices, reduced trade volumes, and retaliatory measures from trading partners. The EU’s proposed tariffs would target a wide range of American goods, potentially impacting various sectors from agriculture to technology. The specific products targeted are often chosen for their political or economic sensitivity, aiming to maximize pressure on the opposing nation. The Spark: The US Trade War and Its Origins To fully grasp the current situation, it’s essential to look back at the catalyst. The specter of a US Trade War was first raised prominently when then-U.S. President Donald Trump announced his intention to impose a hefty 30% tariff on EU imports, effective August 1. This move was part of a broader ‘America First’ economic policy, which prioritized domestic production and aimed to reduce trade deficits by making imported goods more expensive. Trump’s administration had previously imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from various countries, including EU members, and had threatened tariffs on automobiles, among other sectors. This aggressive posture ignited a series of tit-for-tat exchanges, where one nation’s tariff imposition was met with a similar measure from the other. The underlying philosophy behind such actions is often to force renegotiation of trade agreements deemed unfair. However, the practical outcome frequently involves increased costs for businesses and consumers, supply chain disruptions, and heightened uncertainty in global markets. The threat of a 30% tariff from the U.S. on EU imports was particularly alarming due to its significant percentage and broad potential impact across European industries. Key Aspects of the Initial US Tariff Threat: Targeted Goods: While not explicitly detailed in the initial announcement, such tariffs typically target a wide array of goods, from industrial machinery to consumer products, impacting various sectors within the EU. High Percentage: A 30% tariff is substantial, making U.S. goods significantly more expensive for European consumers and businesses, potentially reducing demand. Unilateral Action: The announcement reflected a unilateral approach to trade policy, often bypassing traditional multilateral trade dispute resolution mechanisms. Economic Nationalism: It underscored a broader shift towards economic nationalism, where domestic industries are prioritized, even at the expense of international trade relations. The Mechanism of Retaliatory Tariffs: A Dangerous Cycle The EU’s preparation of 72 billion euros in additional duties is a classic example of Retaliatory Tariffs . These are duties imposed by a country on imported goods from another country in response to the latter imposing tariffs on its exports. It’s essentially an economic tit-for-tat, designed to exert pressure and signal a strong response to perceived unfair trade practices. The goal is to make the initial aggressor reconsider their stance, but it often leads to an escalating cycle that can harm both economies involved. When one major economic power imposes tariffs, the affected party has several options: accept the tariffs, challenge them through international bodies like the World Trade Organization (WTO), or impose their own retaliatory tariffs. The EU’s decision to prepare such a significant package indicates their preference for the latter, aiming to match the U.S. in economic leverage. The selection of goods for these Retaliatory Tariffs is strategic, often targeting products from politically sensitive regions or industries within the aggressor nation, aiming to maximize political pressure. Potential Impacts of Retaliatory Tariffs: Stakeholder Potential Impact Consumers Higher prices for imported goods, reduced variety. Businesses (Importers/Exporters) Increased costs, reduced competitiveness, disrupted supply chains, potential job losses. Governments Increased revenue from tariffs (initially), but potential for reduced overall economic growth and political friction. Global Economy Slower trade growth, increased uncertainty, potential for recession. Why Do Global Trade Tensions Matter to Everyone? Beyond the immediate financial implications for businesses involved in import and export, rising Global Trade Tensions have far-reaching consequences that affect every individual, even those not directly involved in international trade. These tensions create an environment of uncertainty, which is kryptonite for economic growth and investor confidence. When major economies are at odds, it disrupts established supply chains, leading to higher production costs and, ultimately, increased prices for consumers. This phenomenon, known as inflation, erodes purchasing power and can lead to a general slowdown in economic activity. Moreover, persistent trade disputes can strain diplomatic relations, making it harder for nations to cooperate on other critical global issues like climate change, cybersecurity, or public health crises. The interconnectedness of the modern world means that a trade dispute between two major players like the EU and the U.S. can send shockwaves across continents, affecting emerging markets, commodity prices, and even the stability of financial systems. It’s not just about tariffs; it’s about trust, stability, and the fundamental rules governing international commerce. Consider the ripple effect: a company reliant on imported components faces higher costs due to tariffs. To maintain profit margins, they might pass these costs onto consumers, or they might seek alternative, potentially lower-quality, suppliers. This can lead to a decline in product quality or an increase in prices for end-users. Similarly, exporters facing retaliatory tariffs find their products more expensive and less competitive in foreign markets, potentially leading to reduced sales and job cuts. This web of consequences illustrates why Global Trade Tensions are a concern for policymakers, businesses, and citizens alike. Analyzing the Broad Economic Impact on Markets, Including Crypto The potential Economic Impact of an escalating trade war between the EU and the U.S. cannot be overstated. In traditional financial markets, such tensions typically lead to increased volatility, with investors seeking safe-haven assets like gold or certain government bonds. Equity markets often react negatively to news of tariffs, as they signal reduced corporate profits and economic uncertainty. Currency markets can also experience significant fluctuations as traders anticipate changes in trade balances and capital flows. For the cryptocurrency market, the implications are multifaceted. While often seen as a hedge against traditional financial instability, crypto assets are not immune to macro-economic shocks. In times of heightened global uncertainty, Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies can exhibit dual behaviors: Risk-Off Asset: Sometimes, Bitcoin acts as a ‘digital gold,’ with investors flocking to it during periods of geopolitical or economic instability, viewing it as a decentralized alternative to traditional safe havens. Risk-On Asset: At other times, especially during sharp market downturns, crypto can behave like a ‘risk-on’ asset, falling in tandem with equities as investors liquidate assets across the board to cover losses or move to cash. An escalating trade war would likely lead to a general risk-off sentiment across global markets. This could initially put downward pressure on cryptocurrencies as investors reduce exposure to all perceived ‘risky’ assets. However, if the traditional financial system shows signs of deeper distress, the narrative of crypto as a decentralized alternative could gain traction, potentially leading to a resurgence in demand. The key is increased volatility and unpredictability, making informed decision-making crucial for crypto investors. Potential Economic Impact Scenarios: Reduced Global Growth: Tariffs act as taxes, increasing costs and reducing demand, which can lead to a slowdown in global economic expansion. Inflationary Pressures: Higher import costs are often passed on to consumers, leading to rising prices for goods and services. Supply Chain Disruptions: Businesses may struggle to source components or sell products across borders, forcing costly reconfigurations. Investor Uncertainty: Ambiguity surrounding trade policies makes investors hesitant, leading to reduced investment and market volatility. Currency Fluctuations: Trade imbalances can lead to significant shifts in currency values, impacting international trade and investment. Navigating the Storm: Challenges and Actionable Insights The prospect of a full-blown trade war presents significant challenges for businesses, consumers, and investors alike. The primary challenge is the unpredictability of outcomes. Trade disputes can escalate rapidly, or they can be resolved through last-minute negotiations. This uncertainty makes long-term planning difficult. For businesses, it means rethinking supply chains, sourcing strategies, and market entry points. For consumers, it could mean higher prices and fewer choices. For investors, it necessitates a careful re-evaluation of portfolio risk. Key Challenges: Uncertainty: The fluid nature of trade negotiations makes it hard to predict the duration and intensity of disputes. Supply Chain Fragility: Globalized supply chains are vulnerable to disruptions from tariffs, leading to delays and increased costs. Market Volatility: Financial markets, including crypto, will likely experience heightened swings in response to trade news. Erosion of Trust: Trade disputes can damage international cooperation and trust, impacting future collaborations. Actionable Insights for Investors: While the broader geopolitical landscape is beyond individual control, investors can adopt strategies to mitigate risks and potentially capitalize on opportunities: Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider a mix of traditional assets and cryptocurrencies. Within crypto, diversify across different asset classes (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, DeFi tokens). Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on geopolitical developments and trade talks. Understanding the macro environment is crucial for making informed investment decisions. Follow reputable news sources and economic analyses. Risk Management: Implement strict risk management strategies. This includes setting stop-loss orders, avoiding over-leveraging, and only investing what you can afford to lose. Look for Resilience: In crypto, consider projects with strong fundamentals, real-world utility, and robust development teams that might be more resilient to market downturns driven by external factors. Stablecoins, for instance, can offer a temporary refuge during periods of high volatility. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility is inevitable, maintaining a long-term perspective can help weather the storm. Focus on the underlying technology and adoption trends of cryptocurrencies. A Compelling Summary: The Interconnectedness of Our World The EU’s readiness to impose 72 billion euros in Retaliatory Tariffs against the U.S. is a stark reminder of the delicate balance in global trade relations. What begins as a dispute over specific goods can quickly escalate into a full-blown US Trade War , casting a long shadow over the entire global economy. These EU Tariffs are not just numbers on a balance sheet; they represent potential disruptions to supply chains, increased costs for consumers, and a significant dampener on economic growth. The resulting Global Trade Tensions underscore the profound interconnectedness of our world, where actions taken by major economic powers reverberate across all markets, including the dynamic and often unpredictable realm of cryptocurrency. As investors, businesses, and consumers, staying vigilant and informed is paramount. While the immediate focus might be on traditional markets, the ripple effects will undoubtedly touch the crypto space, manifesting as increased volatility or shifts in investor sentiment. The ability to understand these macro-economic forces and adapt investment strategies accordingly will be crucial for navigating the challenging times ahead. The current situation serves as a powerful testament to the fact that no market exists in isolation, and the global economic health directly influences the trajectory of even the most innovative digital assets.

That’s why the merger between Synopsys and Ansys represents more than a significant milestone in Synopsys’ strategy to expand its reach beyond core chip design tools into broader engineering software. China approves $35B deal after U.S. policy reversal China’s top antitrust regulator has conditionally approved the $35B acquisition of Ansys by Synopsys. The approval by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) was confirmed on Monday, just days after the United States quietly relaxed recent export restrictions on chip design software. The merger between Synopsys and Ansys, two leading U.S. software companies, was first announced in January 2024 and had already received clearance from U.S. and European regulators. However, the SAMR paused its review in May after Washington imposed new restrictions that effectively barred U.S. chip design toolmakers like Synopsys from selling software to China. Synopsys’ CEO, Sassine Ghazi, had previously expressed optimism about closing the deal by the end of June. However, that timeline slipped due to SAMR’s pause. In early July, the U.S. government eased up parts of that restrictive policy as trade talks between the U.S. and China, which had been underway for months, reached an agreement in Geneva at the end of June. Companies involved in the negotiations confirmed that the policy changes were communicated earlier this month. According to people familiar with the matter, China’s commerce ministry urged the SAMR to resume the paused approval process shortly after the U.S. eased restrictions. The regulator responded swiftly, approving the deal on July 12, which was a single day after the process resumed. The SAMR’s conditions While China ultimately allowed the transaction, the SAMR imposed three main conditions to manage concerns regarding market concentration and ensure that Chinese companies are not unfairly disadvantaged after the merger. The companies are required to divest business lines where their offerings significantly overlap to mitigate the risk of monopolistic control in specific software markets. The SAMR also stipulated that Chinese customers must be allowed to renew their existing contracts under the same terms after the merger to save local businesses from sudden disruption or unfavorable renegotiations. Finally, the Chinese regulator mandated Synopsys to continue offering its EDA software to Chinese firms on fair and reasonable terms without bias in pricing or functionality. The regulator noted that Synopsys formally accepted these terms on July 11. Any failure to comply could result in penalties under China’s anti-monopoly law. Synopsys, headquartered in Silicon Valley, provides essential EDA tools and intellectual property used by top semiconductor companies like Nvidia and Intel to design and test their chips. Ansys, based in Pennsylvania, initially dealt with structural analysis software but has since become a major player in multiphysics simulation tools used in industries ranging from automotive and construction to healthcare and aerospace. Analysts say that the $35B deal reflects the growing intersection of semiconductor design and engineering workflows, due to the complexity of modern technologies like AI, electric vehicles, and industrial automation.

Recently, Bank of America (BoA), a global banking behemoth, released its insightful “On Chain” report, spotlighting Ethereum as a cornerstone in the burgeoning stablecoin sector. This isn’t just another report; it’s a powerful affirmation of blockchain technology’s increasing relevance and a clear signal of where institutional interest is heading. For anyone tracking the pulse of the crypto market , this development underscores the growing synergy between established finance and the decentralized frontier. Bank of America’s Bold Statement: Why It Matters for the Crypto Market When a venerable institution like Bank of America publishes a report specifically naming a cryptocurrency, it carries immense weight. Their “On Chain” report isn’t just a casual observation; it’s a meticulously researched document that delves into the mechanics and potential of digital assets. By highlighting Ethereum as a key player in the stablecoin market, BoA is effectively validating a significant segment of the digital economy. This recognition from a top-tier bank signals a maturing perspective on cryptocurrencies, moving beyond mere speculation to acknowledging their foundational role in future financial infrastructure. What does this mean for the broader crypto market ? Firstly, it lends credibility. For years, digital assets operated on the fringes, often dismissed by mainstream finance. Now, we’re seeing a shift where major banks are not only studying but actively acknowledging the utility and potential of blockchain networks. This can pave the way for: Increased Mainstream Acceptance: As more traditional institutions engage, the perception of crypto shifts from niche to legitimate. Regulatory Clarity: Bank interest often precedes regulatory frameworks. BoA’s report could encourage clearer guidelines, fostering a more secure environment for growth. Enhanced Investment Flows: Institutional validation can open doors for more conservative investors who previously shied away from the perceived volatility and uncertainty of the crypto space. This report is more than just an analysis; it’s a strategic indicator of the direction traditional finance is likely to take, viewing certain digital assets not as competitors but as integral components of a modernized financial ecosystem. Ethereum’s Unrivaled Dominance in the Stablecoin Sector The report emphasizes a critical statistic: over 50% of all stablecoins currently reside on the Ethereum network. This isn’t by chance; it’s a testament to Ethereum’s robust infrastructure, network effects, and pioneering role in smart contracts. But what makes Ethereum the preferred home for these dollar-pegged digital assets? Ethereum’s Core Strengths for Stablecoins: First-Mover Advantage & Network Effect: Ethereum was the first blockchain to offer a widely adopted smart contract platform, enabling the creation of tokens like ERC-20, which stablecoins utilize. This led to a powerful network effect, attracting developers, users, and liquidity. Security and Decentralization: As one of the most decentralized and battle-tested blockchains, Ethereum offers a high degree of security. This is paramount for stablecoins, which often represent significant value and require unwavering reliability. Vast Developer Ecosystem: Ethereum boasts the largest and most active developer community in the blockchain space. This ensures continuous innovation, maintenance, and the creation of tools and protocols that benefit stablecoin issuers. Interoperability with DeFi: The vast majority of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are built on Ethereum. Stablecoins are the lifeblood of DeFi, used for lending, borrowing, trading, and yield farming. This deep integration makes Ethereum the natural habitat for stablecoins seeking utility and liquidity. While challenges like high gas fees have historically plagued Ethereum, ongoing upgrades (like the transition to Proof-of-Stake and the development of Layer-2 scaling solutions such as Arbitrum and Optimism) are addressing these issues, further solidifying its position. The fact that the majority of stablecoin value is locked on Ethereum underscores its fundamental importance to the digital economy, making it a powerful force for stability and growth. What Drives Institutional Adoption of Stablecoins? The Bank of America report points to growing institutional adoption as a key driver for stablecoin expansion, which in turn benefits Ethereum . But why are traditional financial institutions, corporations, and large-scale investors increasingly looking at stablecoins? Key Drivers for Institutional Interest: Driver Explanation Efficiency & Speed Stablecoins enable near-instantaneous, 24/7 transfers of value globally, bypassing traditional banking hours and lengthy settlement times. This is crucial for cross-border payments and inter-company transfers. Reduced Costs Compared to traditional wire transfers or international payment systems, stablecoin transactions often incur significantly lower fees, especially for large volumes. Programmability Built on smart contract platforms like Ethereum, stablecoins can be programmed for specific uses, enabling automated payments, escrow services, and complex financial instruments without intermediaries. Access to DeFi Yields Institutions can deploy stablecoin holdings into DeFi protocols to earn yields that often surpass those available in traditional finance, creating new revenue streams. Hedging & Liquidity Stablecoins provide a stable, liquid on-ramp and off-ramp for crypto trading, allowing institutions to quickly move in and out of volatile assets without converting back to fiat. This growing interest from institutional players is a game-changer. Their participation brings not just capital but also a demand for robust infrastructure, regulatory clarity, and enterprise-grade solutions, all of which indirectly bolster the underlying networks like Ethereum that host these assets. The Future of Stablecoins: Navigating Regulatory Momentum The phrase “regulatory momentum” is a powerful one in the context of stablecoins. As Bank of America suggests, clear and consistent regulation is not a hindrance but a catalyst for widespread adoption. The current landscape for stablecoins is fragmented, with different jurisdictions proposing various approaches. However, a global push towards comprehensive frameworks is undeniable. Why Regulation is Crucial for Stablecoins and Ethereum: Consumer Protection: Regulations aim to protect users by ensuring stablecoins are adequately backed and transparently managed. Financial Stability: Governments and central banks want to ensure stablecoins don’t pose systemic risks to the broader financial system. Combating Illicit Activities: Clear rules help prevent stablecoins from being used for money laundering or terrorist financing. Fostering Innovation: Paradoxically, well-defined regulations can encourage innovation by providing certainty for businesses and developers. For Ethereum , the impact of regulatory clarity on stablecoins is profoundly positive. If stablecoins gain clear legal standing and operational guidelines, their utility and adoption will explode. This would translate directly into increased transaction volume, network usage, and fee generation for Ethereum, further solidifying its economic model and potentially increasing its value as stablecoin adoption expands, as analysts suggest. The U.S., EU, and other major economies are actively debating and implementing stablecoin legislation. The emergence of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) also plays into this narrative, as governments explore their own digital currency options, potentially coexisting with or influencing the trajectory of private stablecoins. Beyond Stablecoins: How This Impacts the Broader Ethereum Ecosystem While the Bank of America report specifically highlights Ethereum ‘s role in stablecoins, the implications extend far beyond this single use case. The increased usage and institutional interest driven by stablecoins have a ripple effect across the entire Ethereum ecosystem and the broader crypto market . Benefits for Ethereum’s Growth: Increased Network Revenue: More stablecoin transactions mean more gas fees paid to the network. With Ethereum’s EIP-1559 upgrade, a portion of these fees is burned, making ETH a deflationary asset over time. Enhanced Security: Higher network usage and value locked in stablecoins incentivize more validators to secure the Proof-of-Stake network, making it even more robust against attacks. Developer Magnet: A thriving ecosystem with clear institutional interest attracts more talented developers, leading to more innovative applications and services built on Ethereum. Value Accrual: As a foundational layer for such a significant part of the digital economy, Ethereum’s native asset, ETH, is positioned to accrue value from the growth of stablecoins and the broader DeFi landscape they underpin. Catalyst for Layer-2 Adoption: The demand for efficient stablecoin transfers on Ethereum pushes the adoption of Layer-2 scaling solutions, which will ultimately benefit the entire network’s scalability. The synergy is clear: the success of stablecoins on Ethereum directly contributes to the health and growth of the Ethereum network itself. This feedback loop creates a powerful positive cycle, cementing Ethereum’s status as a critical piece of the future financial infrastructure. Challenges and Opportunities Ahead Despite the optimistic outlook, challenges remain. Competition from other Layer-1 blockchains vying for stablecoin dominance, the ongoing need for scalable solutions, and the complexities of global regulatory harmonization are all factors that will shape the future. However, these challenges also present immense opportunities for innovation and collaboration within the crypto space. For individuals and institutions, understanding these dynamics is crucial. The insights from Bank of America provide a valuable lens through which to view the evolving digital asset landscape. It’s a testament to the fact that cryptocurrencies, particularly those with strong fundamentals and real-world utility like Ethereum, are increasingly becoming undeniable forces in global finance.

In a July 2 letter obtained by The Canadian Press , Chew asked to meet within two weeks, pointing out the order dates back to when a U.S. ban on the app seemed likely. He pointed out the directive followed a national security review conducted under the Investment Canada Act, which lets Ottawa examine any foreign investment that might threaten national security. “There is no upside to this outdated and counterproductive government order, which was issued under a different government and in a different era, and which doesn’t reflect today’s reality,” Chew wrote. When François‑Philippe Champagne was industry minister, he said the government acted to address “specific national security risks,” though he did not spell out what those risks were. Critics have pointed to Chinese laws that can force companies like ByteDance Ltd. to assist in intelligence gathering as the core concern. Tiktok challenges national security grounds Chew argued no evidence has ever been shown that TikTok poses a security threat to Canada, and he said officials have been unwilling to discuss possible fixes. He suggested steps such as stronger data‑security protocols, plus more transparency and outside oversight, could ease Ottawa’s worries. Last November, following a national security review of its parent company ByteDance Ltd., Ottawa ordered the Canadian subsidiary to be dismantled. Despite that, the app remains available to its 14 million Canadian users, but would no longer have any presence or representatives within Canada’s jurisdiction. Chew cautioned that enforcing the requirement would isolate Canada from its international partners, particularly those in the Five Eyes intelligence coalition, none of which have taken comparable measures. He added the decision appears rooted in “assumptions about TikTok’s future in the United States which no longer hold true.” The federal review began in late 2023 but remained confidential until March 2024, shortly after the U.S. House of Representatives approved legislation targeting TikTok unless ByteDance divested. In June, President Donald Trump again extended the U.S. deadline for banning the app for a third time. TikTok warns of major layoffs and investment cuts Chew warned that failure to intervene would force TikTok to lay off over 350 staff in Canada, halt direct investments here and scale back support for domestic creators and cultural initiatives. “The wind‑up process is rapidly approaching a critical juncture,” he wrote. He highlighted that TikTok’s Canadian staff have appeared before parliamentary committees, worked with regulators, trained law enforcement on lawful‑access requests and assisted Elections Canada during last year’s federal vote. “TikTok maintaining a presence in Canada means there is a local team who is accountable to Canadian policy‑makers and authorities,” he wrote. On July 7, the company said it would stop sponsoring major Canadian arts events like the Juno Awards and TIFF.A spokeswoman for the minister declined to comment on whether Joly has responded or intends to meet Chew. Separately, TikTok has filed a challenge in Federal Court against the shutdown directive, contending that Ottawa’s actions “bear no rational connection to the national security risks it identifies.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

48252595,https://cryptonews.com/?p=382090,1752535036,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/48252595.jpeg,"ChatGPT Predicts the Price of XRP, Pi Coin, and Dogecoin by the End of 2025",https://cryptonews.com/news/chatgpt-predicts-the-price-of-xrp-pi-coin-and-dogecoin-by-the-end-of-2025/,"OpenAI’s ChatGPT predicts that leading altcoins could establish new record highs in the second half of 2025, riding the momentum of Bitcoin’s explosive rally. Earlier today, Bitcoin rose to a new historic high watermark of $122,838, marking an all-time high with further gains appearing likely. If the momentum holds, global adoption could be just around the corner. This breakout has fuelled strong optimism among crypto enthusiasts, sparking speculation that an even more powerful bull market than the legendary 2021 run may be developing, with multiple top altcoins expected to achieve unprecedented valuations. Outlined below are several digital assets that OpenAI’s ChatGPT predicts hold substantial near-term growth prospects. XRP (Ripple): ChatGPT Predicts This Cross-Border Payments Leader to Double with Ease According to ChatGPT’s projections, Ripple’s XRP could climb to $20 by late 2025, which would equate to a nearly sevenfold increase from its current level around $2.99. This bullish scenario is driven by a combination of growing institutional usage, enhanced regulatory clarity, and mounting speculation about a potential XRP spot ETF that could unlock broader retail and institutional inflows. Additionally, XRP continues to gain recognition for allowing fast, affordable, and compliant international payments. In 2024, the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) commended XRP’s ability to facilitate immediate cross-border transfers without conventional intermediaries. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!! UN Endorses @Ripple and @StellarOrg as Cornerstones of New Global Payments Network! #XRP and #XLM will run the new financial system! pic.twitter.com/ufewexCKmR — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 13, 2024 A pivotal U.S. court decision in 2023 ruled that XRP’s retail transactions did not constitute securities, undermining longstanding SEC claims. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed in March that the protracted legal battle had concluded, removing a key overhang and bolstering market sentiment towards XRP and other altcoins. Looking ahead, the $3 resistance zone is viewed as a major barrier. If XRP can decisively break above its current level in the coming months, ChatGPT’s more conservative $10 target by year-end becomes highly plausible. However, reaching the more ambitious $20 price tag will depend on further regulatory advancements in the U.S. and stabilising political dynamics in regions such as the Middle East. Additionally, among major cryptocurrencies, XRP has been a standout performer, rallying 464% over the past year versus Bitcoin’s 100% rise. Pi Network ($PI): ChatGPT Predicts This Mobile Mining Project Could 10X by Year-End Pi Network has revolutionised the mining sector with its innovative “tap-to-mine” approach, allowing individuals to mine crypto directly from their smartphones without specialised hardware or technical expertise. From its current value near $0.4639, ChatGPT predicts that Pi Network could surge more than tenfold to hit $5 by the end of the year. Instead of resource-intensive mining, users earn PI tokens simply by opening the app and tapping daily – a mechanism that has proven especially attractive to newcomers in the crypto space. Launched in February 2025, $PI has exhibited significant volatility. In early May, it rocketed from $0.58 to $1.57 within just four days, a dramatic 171% gain driven by renewed institutional interest. Currently, PI’s RSI stands at 39 and is climbing, reflecting an underbought asset with strengthening bullish momentum as green candles sweep across the wider crypto market. If this trend continues, $PI may surpass its critical $3 resistance level this summer, setting a new record above February’s all-time high of $2.99. Thanks to its intuitive app and scalable Layer-1 blockchain, Pi Network is well-positioned to accelerate mass adoption, potentially reaching $5 even without a full-scale bull market, though broad user growth and regulatory approvals in the U.S. will be vital to achieving ChatGPT’s loftiest projections. Dogecoin ($DOGE): The Original Meme Coin Primed for a Major Comeback Finally, Dogecoin ($DOGE) , the first meme coin, maintains a robust market valuation of approximately $30.9 billion. Initially created in 2013 as a joke, it has since evolved into a legitimate crypto asset with widespread utility and a dedicated global community. Often moving in sync with Bitcoin, Dogecoin combines meme-driven volatility with surprising long-term resilience. Currently trading at $0.20 and showing little change over the past day, DOGE’s RSI is at 65 and trending upwards, suggesting accumulating buyer interest as Bitcoin continues its rally. Technical charts indicate a steep falling wedge pattern from November through April, signalling strong potential for a sharp upward breakout. ChatGPT predicts that DOGE could rise to $1.50 in a bullish market phase, representing a possible 7.5X return. On the adoption side, Dogecoin continues to receive strong corporate and celebrity endorsements. Tesla accepts DOGE for certain merchandise purchases, while platforms like Revolut and PayPal have integrated it into their payment offerings, strengthening its mainstream utility. TOKEN6900: Could This Emerging Meme Coin Deliver 1000x Returns? While ChatGPT remains bullish on established altcoins, their massive market caps often limit their explosive growth potential. For traders aiming for exponential gains, lesser-known meme coins might offer sharper upside. One such project is TOKEN6900 (T6900) , an ERC-20 meme token that launched its presale barely a week ago. Hey Siri, define aura pic.twitter.com/NVYT1pZmed — Token6900 (@Token_6900) July 8, 2025 TOKEN6900 has already secured around half a million dollars from early investors, reflecting strong market interest and the potential for a powerful launch rally. Unlike meme coins that attempt to pivot towards utility, TOKEN6900 embraces its identity as a purely hype-fueled asset, using irony, aggressive marketing, and FOMO to drive momentum. Its website boldly declares: “It’s Not Built On Fundamentals. It’s Built On Delusion, Irony, And The Collective Hallucination Of Terminally Online Traders.” Inspired by SPX6900, another meme token celebrating absurdist dot-com aesthetics, TOKEN6900 has a total supply of 930,993,091 tokens—exactly one more than SPX6900’s original supply, emphasising its competitive branding. This strategy appears to be resonating, as evidenced by its strong presale performance. While lacking inherent utility, holders can stake tokens for additional yield alongside speculative price gains. Interested participants can purchase T6900 via its official website at a current presale price of $0.006575. With prices set to increase within 24 hours, those aiming for the lowest possible entry point may wish to act promptly.

Simultaneously, numerous top-tier altcoins and the best meme coins —such as TRON, Sui Network, Solana, Pepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin—have recorded fresh highs in recent months, reinforcing the perspective that both sectors still hold substantial growth opportunities. As anticipation builds for the next major bull run, investors are zeroing in on select crypto assets that could potentially eclipse their prior all-time price highs. Ripple (XRP): Cross-Border Payments Crypto Arguably Price Performer of the Year Ripple’s XRP continues to strengthen its position as a key connector between traditional banking infrastructures and blockchain-based remittance networks. Its capability to allow near-instant global transactions at minimal fees has attracted notable institutional interest. The United Nations has even recognised XRP as a feasible solution for transferring funds internationally without reliance on traditional intermediaries. After enduring years of legal challenges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple secured a pivotal legal victory in 2023 when a court ruled that retail sales of XRP did not constitute securities transactions. The SEC officially dropped the case in 2025, ending the four-year litigation. This outcome solidified XRP’s standing within the industry, creating an important regulatory benchmark for the wider crypto market. Investor confidence surged following this development, driving XRP’s price up by over 464% within a year, outperforming Bitcoin’s 103% gain over the same period. XRP faces stiff resistance at its current level of around $3, but it’s likely to smash through this as arguably the biggest success story among the billion cap altcoins. Earlier this year, a bullish flag pattern formed across its support and resistance lines, suggesting the possibility of a surge towards $3.50 this summer, surpassing its previous peak of $3.40 set in January 2018. Pepe ($PEPE): Meme Coin Giant Targets Fresh Record Highs Pepe ($PEPE) has carved out its place among the top three meme coins, driven by the meme’s cultural popularity and strong market performance. Inspired by Matt Furie’s iconic cartoon frog, $PEPE has generated massive returns for early investors and now ranks among the top three meme tokens, with a market valuation exceeding $4.6 billion. pic.twitter.com/jR6ycgAYjc — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 9, 2025 Launched in April 2023, Pepe triggered a wave of copycat tokens, though none have managed to match its momentum or staying power. Its rise gained further traction when Elon Musk briefly adopted a Pepe-themed profile picture on X (formerly Twitter). Currently priced around $0.00001235, $PEPE has posted gains of 23% in the past week, although it is still approximately 56% below its all-time high of $0.00002803 set in late 2024, technical analysts observed a falling wedge pattern in Q1, a formation typically indicative of an incoming upward price breakout. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reached 65, indicating strengthening bullish momentum, suggesting limited further potential gains for $PEPE through the week as it is close to 70, which typically signals an over-priced asset, triggering a selloff. If macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions remain stable, Pepe may embark on another major rally before summer ends. Cardano ($ADA): Can This Eco-Friendly Crypto Set New Price Highs in 2025? Interest in Cardano ($ADA) is on the rise, bolstered by institutional backing and positive technical indicators. Like XRP and Solana, Cardano was named by Donald Trump as a possible reserve crypto asset for inclusion in a proposed U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Founded in 2014 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano is acclaimed for its research-driven development model and energy-efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus, which spurred Ethereum’s own transition from Proof-of-Work to PoS. With a market capitalisation of $27.4 billion, ADA would need to more than triple in value to surpass Solana and challenge Ethereum’s market dominance. In the last seven days, Cardano outperformed Bitcoin during the market-wide rally, adding 27% to its price while Bitcoin only grew 12%. Current projections suggest ADA could climb from its present price of $0.76 to nearly $2 by mid-year. More bullish forecasts anticipate a full recovery to its previous all-time high of $3.09, marking a rebound from its 75.5% drop since September 2021. Strong support levels and a bullish flag formation observed between November and April hint at continued upside potential, although ADA’s RSI has strayed into overbought territory at 72, which means traders will be doing a spot of profit-taking that could depreciate the price over the week. The next immediate level of resistance is at $1.15, but ADA enjoys strong support in the $0.85 to $0.90 range. Seeking the Next Explosive Altcoin?

The Spanish news agency EFE (via MSN ) reported that the Sumar group of MPs wants the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) to use the system for retail investors. The group says that the system would let users “clearly and visually” identify the type of asset they are purchasing. Sumar has sent a written proposal to the regulator. The group complained that a “significant portion” of tokens traded on crypto exchange platforms “lack material backing or any underlying value.” Spanish lending giant BBVA said it won approval to launch Bitcoin and Ether trading, integrating crypto into everyday banking. #BBVA #CryptoTrading https://t.co/ifB7FxuUV8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 10, 2025 Traffic Light Crypto Warnings Coming to Spain? The parliamentary group also wants to rename cryptoassets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) . It proposes using terms like “crypto bets” or “unbacked assets.” The lawmakers justified their request by explaining that coins “do not grant their owners any rights to tangible assets or have any connection to productive activities.” The traffic light warning system would see the CNMV apply one of three labels to each cryptoasset on an exchange or bank’s investing platform. The regulator would give a green light to cryptoassets that are registered, supported, and supervised. These coins would also need to demonstrate stable market performance. It would use yellow for cryptoassets that have “limited backing” or display moderate volatility. An orange light would identify “unsupervised” coins with high risk levels. And a final red label would be reserved for “speculative assets with no identified issuer or material backing.” Europe’s markets regulator criticized crypto oversight in Malta for falling short in several areas related to an unidentified entity it authorized https://t.co/BQrJYufB9B — Bloomberg (@business) July 10, 2025 Crypto Concentrates Wealth, Say Lawmakers Sumar said it is wary of “extreme forms of fictitious capital that do not generate value, but rather generate volatility, inequality, and wealth concentration.” Carlos Martín Urriza, the Sumar spokesperson for Economy and Finance, said policymakers should protect retail investors from assets that are not backed by a verified asset or collateral. Carlos Martín Urriza, the Sumar spokesperson for Economy and Finance. (Source: elDiarioes/YouTube) He added that crypto trading is often more similar to betting than to investing. Furthermore, Sumar wants the CNMV to force banks and exchanges to ensure their customers read pre-purchase information on cryptoassets before allowing them to buy coins. This should apply regardless of a token’s individual classification, Sumar said. It added that these mandatory warnings must be clearly summarized and contain visual elements. Sumar suggested that the CNMV use prominent warning systems. It said the regulator should base its models on those already used in sectors such as gambling or tobacco sales. Restrict Access to AI-powered Trading, MPs Urge Sumar lawmakers also want to create specific regulations for algorithmic trading pools. And the group wants to restrict retail investors’ access to trading platforms that use AI or algorithms.

One notable figure within the community, known as The5Blairs, recently presented a scenario in which the value of 10,000 XRP could grow to $33.8 million. This projection is based on a potential price increase to $3,380 per token. A Breakdown of the $33.8M Estimate At the time The5Blairs made this projection, XRP was valued at approximately $2.20. His analysis relied on the token’s transaction velocity and annual settlement volume. According to his findings, XRP facilitates around $1.3 trillion in yearly transaction value, with a circulating supply of about 60 billion coins and a transaction velocity of 10. He stated that with further expansion, especially through new partnerships and institutional adoption, XRP could potentially support between $100 trillion and $2 quadrillion in annual transactional volume. Based on that assumption, and using proportional valuation metrics, he estimated that XRP’s price would need to increase more than 1,500-fold from $2.20 to approximately $3,380 to handle that level of utility. Currently, XRP is trading around $2.98 , making 10,000 units worth roughly $29,800. Based on The5Blairs’ forecast, an investor holding this amount could see their investment grow dramatically if such projections are realized. Similarly, smaller holdings would still yield considerable returns, for example, 1,000 XRP could translate to $3.38 million, while 50,000 XRP might be valued at over $169 million in this scenario. Notably, Edoardo Farina , founder of Alpha Lions Academy, has consistently advocated for long-term holding, urging investors to maintain at least 10,000 XRP. He emphasizes the importance of patience, noting that the asset’s potential could reward disciplined holders significantly over time. Key Developments That May Influence XRP’s Growth Several factors underpin this price outlook. A significant one is Ripple’s extensive network of business relationships, many of which are formalized through non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). During Ripple’s legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it was revealed that the company had signed more than 1,700 NDAs since 2013 with a variety of banks, financial service providers, and technology firms. These partnerships suggest broader institutional interest that could translate into future adoption of the XRP Ledger. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another catalyst is Ripple’s growing involvement in the cross-border payments sector. In a statement from June 2025, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse noted that the XRP Ledger could eventually support up to 14% of SWIFT’s global transaction volume. Given that SWIFT processes an estimated $150 trillion annually, XRP could potentially account for $21 trillion in payment flow within the next five years if that target is achieved. In addition, The5Blairs emphasized the opportunity for XRP to play a role in the global derivatives and foreign exchange markets. With the notional value of global derivatives estimated at over $1 quadrillion, capturing even a small fraction could generate substantial demand for the token. Nonetheless, it remains uncertain how much of this market XRP can realistically absorb. Further reinforcing optimism around XRP is Ripple’s increasing presence in major financial infrastructure. Earlier in 2025, Ripple’s subsidiary, Hidden Road, became part of the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC)’s government securities netting platform. The DTCC processes over $2 quadrillion in transactions annually, and Ripple’s involvement through Hidden Road could indicate a gradual move toward integration. Recent DTCC patent applications mentioning Ripple and XRP have further fueled speculation, although no official announcements have been made regarding formal partnerships. While these projections are highly speculative and depend on several complex market variables, they reflect the growing confidence within the XRP community. Investors and analysts continue to monitor developments surrounding Ripple’s partnerships, market expansion, and potential use cases, all of which could significantly influence the token’s long-term value trajectory.

This comes despite all the buzz surrounding the technology. During a call with analysts on Monday, Lambert said stablecoins boast incredible technical potential — fast transactions, 24/7 uptime, low fees, programmability, and immutability. But those features alone don’t make them ready for everyday payments. He noted that people also need a frictionless user experience, broad accessibility, and consumer distribution. Mastercard eyes role as key infrastructure provider for stablecoin adoption Mastercard sees itself as the connective tissue between the world of crypto and traditional finance . Lambert emphasized that Mastercard can offer the kind of infrastructure — global acceptance, security protocols, and regulatory compliance — needed to help stablecoins scale and become useful at checkout. This vision isn’t new. Mastercard and rival Visa have been exploring stablecoin initiatives since at least 2021. Mastercard recently partnered with Paxos to support the minting and redemption of the USDG stablecoin. The company also backs stablecoins like FIUSD from Fiserv, PYUSD from PayPal, and USDC from Circle, signaling its long-term ambition to power the backend of stablecoin transactions. Consumer friction and low utility keep stablecoins from mainstream use Lambert notes that about 90% of stablecoin usage today is still tied to crypto trading, not consumer purchases. While companies like Coinbase and Shopify have made moves to enable stablecoin payments for everyday goods and services, significant barriers remain, particularly user adoption and checkout friction. Lambert highlighted that existing stablecoins do not presently offer a compelling use case for peer-to-merchant payments. He likened them to prepaid cards, with the ability for users to spend their wallet balance with some merchants, although the feature set is limited. Despite the common narrative being that stablecoins can be used to circumvent card networks and the transaction fees that are paid to process transactions, Mastercard and the rest are attempting to flip the script, presenting themselves as necessary allies who can help increase stablecoin utility by integrating them into established payment rails. Mastercard’s Chief Commercial Payments Officer Raj Seshadri added that stablecoins have hidden complexities. “You still need to convert to and from fiat. That adds costs — not just the price of the stablecoin itself, but also the FX, regulation, settlement, and ramping infrastructure.” Still others hold counter opinions. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller recently said that stablecoins will bolster competition in the payments system, and that was a positive direction. Speaking at an event at the Dallas Fed, Waller said that the rise of stablecoins will make many payments cheaper and faster. He noted, “And that’s the goal for me, as a free-market capitalist economist, is that I want competition in payments to drive down the cost for households, consumers, and businesses. That’s it.” With stablecoin regulation gaining traction in the US, banks and institutions increasingly weigh their role in this evolving space. Regulatory clarity is prompting some to explore offering stablecoins or deposit tokens to retain deposits that might otherwise flow into digital wallets. According to Lambert, every financial institution evaluates whether it needs to issue stablecoins and what the right product-market fit might be. For many, the focus is on avoiding a loss of control over customer deposits. Beyond the private sector, Lambert noted that governments and central banks are also taking a closer look at digital currencies, aiming to support innovation while preventing dollarization in their domestic economies. “We expect to see a wide range of approaches emerge globally,” he said. The crypto industry is moving closer to mainstream adoption as Congress advances a slate of pro-crypto bills this week. Dubbed “ crypto week ” by the Republican-led House, the legislative push includes a landmark bill to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, potentially heading to President Donald Trump’s desk for approval.

Here’s What It Means for Ripple,https://timestabloid.com/federal-reserve-implements-iso-20022-heres-what-it-means-for-ripple/,"The U.S. Federal Reserve has officially transitioned its FedWire Funds Service to the ISO 20022 messaging standard, a move that could significantly benefit Ripple, which has been ISO 20022-ready for years. Effective from today, July 14, 2025, all institutions using the FedWire Funds Service are now required to process transactions using ISO 20022 . This transition, originally scheduled for March 2025 but postponed to provide additional preparation time, marks a critical step in modernizing the U.S. financial system. ISO 20022 is a globally adopted framework for electronic data exchange between financial institutions. It provides standardized formats that support detailed and structured messaging. This not only enhances data clarity but also streamlines transaction processing, reduces errors, and strengthens regulatory compliance, especially for cross-border payments. By the end of 2025, projections suggest that over 80% of international financial flows will utilize ISO 20022. As adoption accelerates worldwide, it is quickly becoming the default protocol across the banking and payments industry. Ripple’s Early Adoption Gives It a Competitive Edge Ripple positioned itself early to capitalize on the global shift to ISO 20022. In 2020, it became the first blockchain company to join the ISO 20022 Standards Body. Since then, Ripple has aligned its infrastructure, particularly RippleNet, to meet the standard’s requirements. RippleNet supports structured financial messaging in accordance with ISO 20022, enabling seamless integration with traditional banks and financial entities that rely on the same format. This compliance enhances the platform’s speed, transparency, and interoperability, critical features for modern financial institutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Although XRP, Ripple’s native cryptocurrency, is not an ISO 20022 messaging token, it remains integral to RippleNet’s operations. XRP is primarily used in Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service, now known as Ripple Payments, which facilitates instant currency conversion and settlement, eliminating the need for pre-funded accounts. Implications for Ripple in the U.S. Market The Federal Reserve’s adoption of ISO 20022 could increase demand for payment infrastructure that already supports the standard. Ripple, having implemented ISO 20022-compliant messaging well in advance, is well-positioned to assist U.S. financial institutions through this transition. In addition to its technical readiness, Ripple is actively expanding its presence in the American financial landscape. The company recently applied for a U.S. banking license and a Federal Reserve master account for RLUSD, Ripple’s upcoming stablecoin. These developments suggest Ripple is working to deepen its involvement in the domestic banking sector. As more U.S. banks seek partners that can meet ISO 20022 standards, Ripple’s early adoption and proven infrastructure could prove advantageous, potentially driving greater adoption of its services across the regulated financial ecosystem.

Who’s Really Winning?",https://thecoinrise.com/while-subbd-builds-early-buzz-blockdag-secures-338m-expands-reach-with-seattle-sports-deals-whos-really-winning/,"The SUBBD presale has begun making the rounds, pulling in $750,000 and drawing early attention from altcoin fans. With a price still low enough to create buzz and growing talk around the next altcoin cycle, the setup is working in its favor. But while SUBBD builds early traction, another name has already captured the spotlight and a massive slice of the market. BlockDAG (BDAG) has passed $338 million in funds raised and locked partnerships with two professional Seattle sports franchises, taking a clear lead in visibility and execution. While SUBBD is still getting its footing, BlockDAG has already delivered measurable results and built out real-world connections. Early Days for SUBBD: Can the Hype Hold? SUBBD’s presale has reached $750,000, sparking growing interest among those watching for the next altcoin breakout. With a low entry price and strong community push, the project is starting to build traction. Market sentiment is leaning optimistic, and that’s helping more traders take notice of early-stage coins like SUBBD. The project claims it aims to simplify DeFi by offering a smoother interface, easier staking features, and a better user experience overall. These upgrades are part of what’s being promised in future rollouts, though most of the features are still in the development phase. As of now, much of the buzz is based on potential rather than working products. That hasn’t stopped chatter from picking up online. Social engagement is on the rise, and daily buy-ins are increasing, showing a steady uptick in early participation. Still, the project will need to follow through with real progress. For now, SUBBD is in the spotlight, but staying there will depend on execution, not just excitement. BlockDAG Delivers on Price and Partnerships! BlockDAG is pushing forward fast. The project has already raised $338 million, with 23.8 billion coins sold across multiple batches. It’s currently in Batch 29, where the regular price is $0.0276. However, as part of the GLOBAL LAUNCH release, buyers can still access a special price of $0.0016 until August 11. With the confirmed launch price set at $0.05, this gives users a chance to lock in a 3,025% return. Those who joined back in Batch 1 are already sitting on a 2,660% gain compared to the current launch rate. Beyond strong pricing and presale performance, BlockDAG is also scoring big on real-world exposure. The project has partnered with two professional Seattle sports teams, the Seattle Orcas and the Seattle Seawolves. These teams bring loyal fan bases and major league attention, helping BlockDAG reach audiences beyond just crypto circles. These aren’t shallow branding deals. They’re part of a broader push to build credibility, drive mass adoption, and make BlockDAG a household name in and outside of crypto. While many projects promise big things and stay in development mode, BlockDAG is already delivering results. From major sports partnerships to pricing momentum, it’s turning plans into action. The numbers, the strategy, and the visibility all show that BlockDAG is already ahead of the curve, and still climbing. Two Coins, Two Different Paths SUBBD is still in the early stages, and its low entry price is helping it gain attention. Early optimism is there, and the project could ride future market momentum. But hype alone won’t carry it forever. The gap between early buzz and long-term success is often bigger than expected. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is already making big moves. It has raised $338 million, sold 23.8 billion coins, and built partnerships with two major teams. This isn’t just about talking a good game, it’s real action, real numbers, and a growing base of support. Where SUBBD is working to build its name, BlockDAG has already carved out a spot. While both projects are on the map, only one has real traction right now. In this space, timing counts. But results matter even more, and BlockDAG has both. The Bottom Line SUBBD is seeing early success, and the price is drawing in attention. If the overall market stays positive, more people could jump into the presale. Still, it’s a wait-and-see situation, as the project’s promises are yet to be proven. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is all about delivery. With $338 million raised and 23.8 billion coins already sold, the project has momentum, and now, major partnerships with the Seattle Orcas and Seawolves to back it up. The GLOBAL LAUNCH release price of $0.0016, valid until August 11, makes it even more appealing. At launch, the $0.05 price locks in a 3,025% return. SUBBD is still trying to build its case. BlockDAG is already making its mark.

Currently, technical indicators, surging liquidity, and macroeconomic tailwinds have analysts predicting that the leading cryptocurrency is on the verge of a parabolic surge to a $140,000 top in the next few weeks. $140,000 Set As Bitcoin Next Top Target The Bitcoin price is exhibiting remarkable strength as it continues its parabolic advance beyond the $123,000 range. Technical indicators identified by crypto analyst Mr. Wall Street are now aligning around a new short-term target between $135,000 and $140,000. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices Are Surging Today According to the market expert’s chart report, BTC has successfully broken out of a Broadening Wedge pattern after consolidating between a descending support and horizontal resistance for nearly two months. The decisive breakout above the $112,000 resistance validates the analyst’s earlier bullish projections. Initially, the analyst proposed two possible scenarios: A breakout above all-time highs around $112,000 leading directly to a $117,000-$120,000 rally or a brief dip to $92,000 to fill the CME gap before continuing up toward the same target zone. Based on its recent price movement, Bitcoin has chosen to follow the first scenario, underscoring the strength of its bullish momentum and signaling that short-term Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) has had little to no effect. With the second scenario officially invalidated, BTC’s price trajectory is seemingly clearer and higher. The recent surge above $123,000 has also spotlighted the next major liquidity pool between $135,000 and $140,000. The chart highlights that reaching this zone would liquidate over $45 billion in short positions. Following this, the next target zone sits between $160,000 and $170,000, threatening another $70 billion in short liquidations. M2 Surge And MACD Fuel BTC’s Bullish Case Mr. Wall Street’s bullish setup for Bitcoin is further supported by macroeconomic and key chart indicators. The analyst pointed to US President Donald Trump’s recent approval of a bill to raise the country’s debt ceiling—a move that signals accelerating debt growth. This, in turn, is expected to expand M2 money supply, which historically correlates with rising prices for assets like Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Repeat Parabolic Phase From 2017 And 2021? Here’s The Target BTC’s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also remains fully intact across all time frames, while the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio is still well below historic top levels. In addition, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has yet to enter overbought territory. These indicators confirm that Bitcoin is still far from a macro top, making the $135,000 – $140,000 range a plausible interim target. Looking ahead, Mr. Wall Street emphasizes that Bitcoin has entered a supercycle, a phase where the market is marked by price discovery. While he acknowledges the possibility of a short-term retest of the $112,000 level before continuing upward, the analyst maintains that, regardless of minor pullbacks, the price action from here is likely to be swift and aggressive.

According to the NY Times sources, senior team members, including Meta’s freshly appointed chief AI officer, 28‑year‑old Alexandr Wang met last week to debate pausing the release of their most advanced publicly available model, Behemoth. The focus was instead on developing a proprietary version. Meta used to make its AI code public so other developers could build on it. A closed‑source model keeps the code private, but Meta argues that sharing openly speeds up progress and gives more people access to powerful tools. Switching to a private model would be a big change for Meta, which developers have praised for its open‑source approach. As recently as last year, Yann LeCun, one of Meta’s top AI researchers, asserted that “the platform that will win will be the open one.” Earlier this year, the Chinese venture DeepSeek leveraged Meta’s public code to create its own sophisticated AI chatbot, underscoring the tangible value of openness. Although Meta finished training Behemoth on extensive datasets aimed at maximizing its capabilities, sources report that the rollout was postponed after initial in‑house evaluations fell short of projected benchmarks. Following the inauguration of its superintelligence division last month, the Behemoth project considered a “frontier” effort at the leading edge of AI development, was put on hold pending further review. These talks are still early with no decisions made, and any change would need CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s approval. Meta could keep its public models while also building a private one. Either way, moving toward a private model would be a big strategic shift as it tries to keep upwith rivals like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic. In a podcast interview last year, Zuckerberg said, “We’re obviously very pro open source, but I haven’t committed to releasing every single thing that we do.” Meta’s new lab is under scrutiny after several AI missteps Meta has dealt with management problems, seen key staff depart, and launched products that didn’t catch on. Zuckerberg still wants to build an AI that achieves superintelligence, something some describe as beyond human thinking. To staff the initiative, Zuckerberg initiated an aggressive recruitment campaign, offering nine‑figure compensation proposals to lure leading researchers from OpenAI, Google, Apple, Anthropic, and others. Moreover, he reassigned the executive formerly in charge of Meta’s generative AI division. In June, Meta poured $14.3 billion into Scale AI, the company founded and helmed by Alexandr Wang. The deal granted Meta a 49 % equity share, and Wang, together with some of his key associates, transitioned into senior posts within Meta. Following the investment, Meta rebranded its AI arm as “Meta Superintelligence Labs,” with Wang stepping into the role of chief AI officer. He now leads an elite cohort of about a dozen recent hires, several Scale AI deputies, and Nat Friedman, ex‑CEO of GitHub. Sources indicate that numerous members of Wang’s group gathered at Meta’s Menlo Park headquarters for their inaugural in‑person meeting last week. They occupy a secluded office suite adjacent to Zuckerberg’s workspace. On Tuesday, Wang held a Q&A with about 2,000 AI team members. He said his core team’s work would stay private and that everyone in the AI division would now focus on building superintelligence. Looking forward, some AI employees anticipate that the upcoming vesting window in August, which will allow certain staff to liquidate company shares. It could trigger a wave of departures among those not selected for the superintelligence group. On Monday, Zuckerberg unveiled intentions to commit hundreds of billions of dollars toward AI compute infrastructure, aiming to have Meta’s inaugural supercluster operational by next year. In a Facebook update , Zuckerberg stated, “Meta Superintelligence Labs will have industry‑leading levels of compute and by far the greatest compute per researcher. I’m looking forward to working with the top researchers to advance the frontier!” He called the first supercluster “Prometheus” and disclosed plans for additional multi‑gigawatt installations, such as “Hyperion,” projected to reach five gigawatts over the next few years. Zuckerberg’s moves show he’s frustrated with how slowly Meta’s AI is progressing. After the underweheling response to Llama 4 in April, he is taking a different road to better compete with OpenAI and Google. “For our superintelligence effort, I’m focused on building the most elite and talent‑dense team in the industry,” he added, marking the start of a new phase in Meta’s AI endeavors.

Huang talked to CNN’s Fareed Zarkaria about AI as a positive force . He called it “the greatest technology equalizer the world has ever seen.” As Nvidia’s CEO noted in his paper, there will always be jobs, but AI is expected to alter working practices across every industry and profession. He said everyone else’s job would be 50% less than normal, but that didn’t mean there would be no jobs left for people. Work would change, not vanish, he argued. He said it is one example of how AI enables people who are (or aren’t) computer literate to become more productive. Huang mentioned the number of new users to ChatGPT, saying that even on their first try, they saw value in it. According to him, AI is just about the empowerment of people. On the other hand, Huang underscored that AI is a tool, not a weapon. Its filing times have gone from those built on specialized knowledge to becoming something AI should be able to handle in load times. He says the AI trend is not about devaluing human workers but valuing them more. AI will reshape the workforce with more opportunities Though the Nvidia CEO acknowledged that some jobs could be automated out of existence, he emphasized the potential for new opportunities. Huang said AI is not here to replace humans, but rather “to augment human capabilities.” He foresees new jobs in AI, from training models and engineering prompts to curating data, managing humans, and ensuring AI ethics. This is consistent with earlier shifts during the industrial and digital revolutions, when technology replaced some jobs but created many new industries and jobs. He added that AI was a “co-pilot,” rather than a competitor. Automation of repeatable and boring work can free humans from focusing on creative, strategic, and people work. He said this will improve health, education, financial, and agricultural systems. More crucially, Huang stresses the need for societies to retrain and educate workers to make this transition. People need to be educated to cohabitate and work with the AI, and riding the back of this dragon is the secret to a world and economy that spins ever upward. Nvidia challenges apocalyptic AI predictions Huang’s view contrasts with some of the more dystopian notes of the AI industry. In May, Dario Amodei, the CEO of the $61.5 billion artificial intelligence startup Anthropic, told Axios that AI might be able to strip half of all entry-level white-collar jobs from the global economy within the next five years. He warned that unemployment figures could climb double if the switch isn’t handled well, rebounding from 10% to 20%. In just a year, AI systems could write all the code a business requires, Amodei said. Some, such as Adam Dorr, an employee of the Wells research house RethinkX, believe that AI and robotics could automate away virtually all human labor by 2045. The transition will be difficult, Dorr told The Guardian, and there isn’t much time to get ready for the shift AI will herald. But Huang is still not caving to panic. He believes such doomsday scenarios fail to consider the possibility of AI as a force for good for humanity. “The effect of AI is not so much replacement but transformation,” said Huang. The AI revolution is being driven in no small part by Nvidia, which Huang heads. The company’s chips power some of the world’s most advanced AI models, such as the ones underpinning ChatGPT and other large language models. But Huang insists that such technology should empower, not replace, humans. As the world grapples with adapting its workforce for the era of silicon and artificial intelligence, Nvidia’s CEO offers a clear message: Don’t fear AI—use it to redefine the future of work.

This follows a week of strong gains, with BTC rising by more than 10% amid a broader uptrend in the cryptocurrency market. Despite the minor pullback, market analysts are closely monitoring on-chain and derivatives data to assess whether momentum is building toward a more aggressive phase of the rally. The recent surge has also benefited the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, lifting total global crypto market capitalization to just under $4 trillion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Records: What Miners and Leverage Traders Are Doing Behind the Scenes While Bitcoin continues to dominate in terms of volume and influence, sentiment metrics suggest that traders and investors may still be approaching with measured optimism. According to analysts, several indicators are now pointing to a potential shift in market dynamics that could influence Bitcoin’s next major move. Market Euphoria Not Yet Confirmed CryptoQuant contributor Joao Wedson has offered insights into the current structure of the Bitcoin market through an analysis of the price gap between spot and perpetual futures contracts on Binance. In a recent QuickTake post, Wedson noted that the spot price of Bitcoin continues to outpace the perpetual futures price, a sign that market sentiment has not yet tipped into full euphoria. Historically, a positive gap between the two markets has signaled increased speculative activity and the onset of parabolic rallies. “The gap is still in negative territory,” Wedson stated, “but the narrowing trend indicates that sentiment may be transitioning from cautious to more optimistic.” The analysis implies that traders in the futures market have yet to aggressively price in further upside, possibly waiting for stronger confirmation before deploying leverage. Should this gap flip to positive territory, it could be interpreted as a sign of increased risk appetite, potentially fueling a sharper upward move. Wedson also emphasized the importance of monitoring how derivatives markets respond in the coming days. “If the trend continues and flips positive, we could see a more intense phase of the rally driven by leveraged traders,” he wrote. Until then, the current environment appears to reflect a market in the process of building a foundation, rather than one that has already entered a euphoric phase. Bitcoin Profit-Taking Remains Measured In another analysis, CryptoQuant’s Enigma Trader examined the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), a key indicator used to evaluate the extent of realized profits by Bitcoin holders. According to the post, SOPR levels have remained moderately above 1 as BTC hit new highs, suggesting that some profit-taking is occurring, but not at a rate that disrupts the broader trend. The analyst observed that a spike in SOPR around July 3–4 coincided with short-term holders taking profits.

Republicans introduced a trio of bills to reshape digital asset policy, only to face sharp pushback from Democrats accusing them of favoring corporate interests over everyday Americans. The proposed legislation , comprising the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, was introduced in the House of Representatives to address data privacy compliance and future digital currency systems. GOP lawmakers argue the bills are crucial to maintaining the US’s competitive edge in financial innovation. However, during a heated Rules Committee hearing on Monday, Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern denounced the initiative as a “crypto giveaway,” slamming it as a misguided effort that ignores the risks of crypto-related corruption. “I have not had one person in my district come up to me and say, ‘please, please Jim, make it easier for crypto millionaires to get richer, please make it easier to con people,’” said McGovern. “Yet that is exactly what is going on here.” The remarks were a direct jab at President Donald Trump’s increased activity in the crypto space, including his family-linked company World Liberty Financial and its associated stablecoin USD1 (and his meme coin, Official Trump). GOP defends innovation push In a rebuttal, Republicans said the bill is meant to future-proof the economy and maintain US competitiveness in a fast-evolving cryptospace. The GOP’s tactics were also a central focus when committee chairman Rep. Virginia Foxx gaveled in the session. Foxx described the GENIUS Act as historic legislation, stating that it would help drive responsible innovation in the United States. She added that Republicans look forward to working with businesses nationwide to fulfill the Act’s promise. The GENIUS Act aims to oversee stablecoins by establishing comprehensive federal standards for issuers. The CLARITY Act addresses deficiencies in digital asset market structure, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act seeks to prohibit a US Central Bank Digital Currency that the government would use, many Republicans fear to surveil private financial activity. Republicans argue that over-regulation should not stymie innovation and financial freedom. They say the bills will advance transparency, offer legal surety, and guard against harm to consumers while also helping to spur growth in the digital economy. Critics, however, argue that the legislation doesn’t do enough to tackle fraud and abuse. McGovern said the bills opened doors to hucksters and market manipulation and were tilted toward rich insiders rather than average investors. Lawmakers struggle to build bipartisan support Republicans face an uphill task despite their enthusiasm. With a narrow majority in the House and no Senate control, the GOP may rely on Democrats to progress the legislation in both chambers. Democrats are not budging easily. Those conflicts of interest, tied to Trump and spread across government, alarmed Representative Maxine Waters and Senator Adam Schiff. Schiff cautioned of “ dangerous entanglements ” between crypto firms and elected officials. Waters noted that many components of the bill aligned with the goals of Trump’s crypto-backed ventures. She emphasized that the American people deserved policies that protected their money, not schemes designed to enrich political allies. Some Democrats also said the legislation diverted the House from urgent matters, like preventing national security threats and addressing economic inequality. And even as crypto comes under greater scrutiny for fraud and instability, most recently in the unraveling of FTX and ongoing enforcement actions by the SEC, some lawmakers are raising questions about whether it’s time to ease up on oversight. The discussion on Monday turned temporarily to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, dramatizing the extent to which the legislative calendar has become infused with tension and pressure. However, Republicans say they are committed to revisiting the crypto package before the August recess, which means they have just under two weeks to do so.

This slowdown may push authorities to introduce new measures to keep growth on track. To date, the globe’s second‑largest economy has avoided a big downturn, supported by a tentative trade agreement with Washington and the buffer of current policy measures. However, the sentiment among investors has turned cautious for the latter half of the year. This is marked by slow exports, persistent price declines and subdued consumer confidence. Forecasts suggest Tuesday’s release at 2 am GMT will reveal 5.1% annual growth in Q2, down from 5.4% in Q1, according to the latest Reuters consensus. “While growth has been resilient year‑to‑date, we still expect it to soften in the second half of the year, due to the payback of front‑loaded exports, ongoing negative deflationary feedback loop, and the impact of tariffs on direct exports to the U.S. and the global trade cycle,”said analysts at Morgan Stanley. They added that “The third‑quarter growth could slow to 4.5 percent or lower, while Q4 faces unfavourable base effect, putting the annual growth target at risk.” Beijing may announce more spending Morgan Stanley anticipates that Beijing may roll out an extra fiscal package ranging from 500 billion to 1 trillion yuan starting towards the end of Q3. June customs figures indicated a rebound in inbound shipments and a modest uptick in exports, driven by a rush to beat an early‑August tariff ceasefire deadline with the United States. Other June metrics on factory activity and consumer spending are forecast to decelerate further. Quarter‑on‑quarter, the Reuters survey predicts GDP will have risen by 0.9% in Q2, after a 1.2% gain in Q1. Furthermore, analysts expect growth to moderate to roughly 4.6% in 2025, falling short of official ambitions, and slip to around 4.2% in 2026. Investors are turning their attention to the late‑July Politburo session, anticipating cues on future policy moves and potential new economic support. According to the survey, experts foresee a 10‑basis‑point reduction in the People’s Bank of China seven‑day reverse repo rate, and a comparable decrease to the loan prime rate, sometime in Q4. Job market makes output cuts risky So far this year, authorities have stepped up public works funding and expanded household subsidy programs, while the central bank in May trimmed borrowing costs and pumped cash into markets to offset trade‑related headwinds. However, experts warn these measures might not be enough to stop the ongoing price drops. June’s producer price index plunged at a rate unseen in roughly two years, underlining persistent deflationary trends. Observers expect officials to step up cuts to excess factory production and look for new ways to encourage domestic spending. Analysts say it’s tricky to cut excess output without triggering major layoffs in a weakening job market. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Surprisingly, while Ethereum continues to dominate headlines, a growing number of savvy investors are shifting focus toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising star in the decentralized lending space that’s quietly gaining traction. The project is priced at $0.03 in the 5th presale phase, which is more than 70% sold. Those who invest in this phase will get a 100% return on investment after listing the token. More than $12.3 million has already been raised, with a total of more than 13,200 early investors. During presale Phase 6, the token will cost $0.035, and that represents 16.67% return on investments made in Phase 5. This could signal a broader shift in investor priorities beyond traditional blue-chip tokens. Ethereum Eyes Fresh Breakout Amid ETF Inflows and Upgrades The good news is that Ethereum (ETH) has recovered its position below the $3,000 level, trading about $2,948 and swinging in between $2,934 and $3,028, having achieved a 6-8 percent upsurge driven by the huge flows of ETFs and tokenization. Individual products at BlackRock, such as the company ETHA trust attracted an all-time high of $300 million in a single day, which adds to a combined $700+ million of flows into ETFs weekly as institutional players show renewed confidence in the DeFi and staking environment at Ethereum. The smart money is still around, but people are gaining more interest in some new DeFi projects, like Mutuum Finance. Presale Milestone: Mutuum Finance Hits $12.3 Million The Mutuum Finance presale has more than 13200 investors and has raised more than $12.3 million. Investors have picked up more than 70% of the tokens in phase 5. This indicates growing confidence of investors in the short-term success of the project as well as in their bright future. Mutuum Finance Launches Massive Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering $100,000 giveaway , divided into 10 winners of 10,000 MUTM tokens. In addition, the top 50 holders of the Mutuum Finance will be rewarded under its newly introduced leaderboard system. As the users level up they will be rewarded the bonus tokens. Transforming DeFi Lending: The Mutuum Finance Approach Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is transforming DeFi lending through the creation of a platform that renders customers the sole owner of their assets. It is a workable multifunctional double-lending system, which incorporates the synergy of both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. In P2C, lending pools are utilized via smart contracts. The platform is sensitive to prevailing market conditions in real time, an aspect that makes returns to lenders less volatile and borrowers financially stable. Through the elimination of intermediaries, the P2P model provides direct lending, which is particularly convenient on highly volatile assets like other coins. Over $12.3 million raised, 13,200+ early investors, and 70% of Phase 5 tokens already gone, Mutuum Finance is clearly gaining momentum as smart money rotates into high-upside DeFi plays. While Ethereum targets a modest move toward $4,000, early MUTM buyers are eyeing a 100% ROI at launch and an even greater upside as uncollateralized lending and dual lending architecture reshape the DeFi narrative. Phase 6 will push the price to $0.035, locking in a 16.67% return for Phase 5 investors. Add in a $100,000 giveaway and a leaderboard rewards system, and the case for Mutuum becomes even stronger.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As bitcoin (BTC) trades near $119,500, having just recently broken through another all-time high of $120,000 , digital asset investment products are also breaking records for inflows – but there's a regional disparity. According to CoinShares, U.S.-listed funds dominated with $3.74 billion in inflows, while Germany saw $85.7 million in outflows, underscoring a growing divergence in global institutional sentiment. This robust institutional appetite in the U.S. is exemplified by Vanguard’s evolving stance on crypto investments. Despite once branding bitcoin as an ""immature asset class,"" the $10 trillion asset manager is now Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy (MSTR)'s largest shareholder, indirectly becoming the most significant Bitcoin holder in traditional finance, as Presto Research recently noted in a d aily markets update. Meanwhile, QCP Capital highlights in a recent note that institutional enthusiasm remains notably robust, exemplified by over $2 billion net inflows into spot BTC ETFs last week. Yet, derivatives markets suggest a more nuanced approach. Leveraged long positions are expanding aggressively, with perpetual funding rates approaching an elevated 30% and open interest surpassing $43 billion, levels unseen since BTC reclaimed $100k in January. Such aggressive positioning raises caution flags, recalling February's abrupt $2 billion liquidation event. “Froth is building,” QCP warns. BTC Continues to Outpace Luxury Watches Bitcoin (BTC) is up 27.87% year-to-date and 13.22% in the past month, easily outperforming the luxury watch market’s modest +4.5% rebound in Q2, according to a recent report co-authored by Morgan Stanley and WatchCharts. Gains were concentrated in flagship models, Daytona, Nautilus, Royal Oak, while brands like Panerai, Breitling, and IWC underperformed. Inventory for watches under $5,000 remains historically elevated, and dealer turnover in that range continues to lag. “Price recovery remains narrow and concentrated,” the report notes, driven by “renewed interest from high-end collectors and improved global risk appetite.” Both BTC and watches, it adds, tend to benefit from “expansionary monetary environments and periods of wealth creation.” But the speculative capital isn’t flowing evenly. Bitcoin has attracted more of the macro-driven bid, with institutional inflows and 24/7 liquidity making it the preferred high-beta asset. The pandemic-era correlation between BTC and watches, both beneficiaries of easy money and speculative excess, broke down in late 2023 with the approval of U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs. BTC has since matured into a macro-sensitive, institutionally backed asset, while watches have returned to their roots: fashion. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin briefly approached $123,000 before cooling off, while crypto-related stocks held modest gains and analysts said the market remains far from euphoric, with one projecting BTC’s $2.5 trillion market cap could eventually converge with gold’s $22 trillion. ETH: ETH surged past $3,079 in early trading on strong volume before retreating in the afternoon to settle near $3,011, forming a textbook breakout-pullback pattern with support holding above the key $3,000 level. Gold: Gold slipped 0.1% after hitting a three-week high amid renewed tariff threats from President Trump and focus on trade talks and U.S. data, while silver surged to its highest level since September 2011. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets opened mixed Tuesday, with investors brushing off President Trump’s tariff shifts and turning attention to upcoming Chinese economic data, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 remained flat. S&P 500: RBC Capital Markets raised its 2025 S&P 500 target to 6,250 from 5,730, but unlike Goldman and BofA, it expects little upside from current levels, with the index already above 6,280 as of July 11.

Overall retail sales rose 3.1% compared with a year ago, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said. The upturn was largely the result of warmer weather, which had prompted Britons to spend more on electric fans, sports, and leisure equipment. The bright weather also moved consumers out of doors, increasing spending on seasonal goods . The BRC’s Chief Executive, Helen Dickinson, said that food and non-food performances were good. “Retail sales heated up in June, with both food and non-food performing well,” she said. “Food sales remained strong, though this was partly driven by food inflation, which has risen steadily over the year.” Food sales alone rose 4.1% while non-food purchases rose 2.2%, overturning the retail sector’s drag on gross domestic product in May. Economic uncertainty and increased cost of living have made consumers tighten their belts this month. Businesses regain confidence The increase in retail spending is the latest in a series of indicators that point to the possibility that the UK economy is recovering after a weak spring. The economy shrank in April and May, the first consecutive contraction in economywide activity since 2009, as the country reeled from a combination of domestic and international forces, ranging from newly imposed tariffs by the United States to a hike in corporate taxes, and a national minimum wage that was raised that prompted businesses to pare back hiring and payroll costs. But the climate for business is improving. A purchasing managers’ index (PMI) published earlier this month indicated that private sector activity expanded quickly by nine months in June. That is for all of manufacturing and services. At the same time, a recent Bank of England survey showed that companies are ready to start taking on new staff again, which is good news for employment and consumer spending in the future. The survey found that companies planned to add to payrolls in the next 12 months by 1.1%, a sharp rebound compared to how cautiously the nation’s businesses began the year. Research fellow Paul Dales said in a note to investors that there was evidence to suggest the worst of the economic downturn had passed and that conditions were likely to improve. He added that although the recovery remained tentative, recent data indicated that confidence was returning in key sectors of the economy. Starmer leverages retail bounce for political relief The brighter economic horizon could not have come at a better time for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has been under pressure to produce results soon after assuming office . His administration has its hands full: from cost-of-living complaints to low productivity and slow growth. The recovery in retail sales, rising business confidence, and better labor market expectations offer a respite. It could give his administration the political room it requires to launch new reforms and investment plans without overshadowing a worsening recession. However, caution still abounds; amid ongoing global uncertainty, rising food prices, and potential interest rate changes from the Bank of England, economists said the trend indicates the UK could miss a prolonged recession. For Starmer, it may represent a narrow window of opportunity to cement public backing and stabilize the economy. Should these green shoots continue to flourish during the remainder of the summer and into the autumn, the UK could end 2025 with a stronger base for its economy than many dared to believe possible earlier this year.

According to on-chain data from Artemis and deBridge, more than $125 million worth of assets have been bridged into Solana from other blockchains in the last seven days. REPORT: In the last 7 days, over $125 million bridged from other chains to @Solana , including $70 million+ from Ethereum alone. (A growth of nearly 40% compared to last week) pic.twitter.com/jMVTiJZ8jr — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) July 14, 2025 Ethereum Fuels $70M Liquidity Wave Into Solana as Meme Coin Hype Cools Solana is experiencing a major liquidity revival, driven primarily by Ethereum, as the volume of bridged assets surges. According to data from Artemis, Ethereum accounted for over $70 million in inflows into Solana, representing nearly 56% of the total. Arbitrum followed with $14.1 million, while Polygon and BNB Chain contributed $7.5 million and $2.6 million, respectively. Other smaller chains made up the remaining $4.2 million. The total bridged volume into Solana rose by almost 40% week-over-week, with the Ethereum-to-Solana route emerging as the most dominant pipeline. Data from deBridge further confirms that $31 million in assets flowed from Ethereum to Solana alone. Source: solscan Much of this capital shift appears linked to a cooling off in the once-explosive meme coin launching frenzy. While Solana had previously seen a massive surge in new token launches, last week saw only 322,000 new token launches, a sharp slowdown compared to earlier peaks. This trend indicates a move back toward established projects and tokens. Interestingly, even during the heated rivalry between LetsBONK and Pump.fun, token activity remained relatively muted. LetsBONK graduated 1,243 tokens, double Pump.fun’s 622, and also launched 130,605 new tokens, significantly ahead of Pump.fun’s 77,250. Amid a slowdown in new meme coin launches, several older and more established Solana-based meme tokens are seeing renewed interest. Traders appear to be redirecting liquidity toward more recognizable assets, including Pepe ( PEPE ), Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Bonk ( BONK ), and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) , signaling a shift from novelty to familiarity. Source: Cryptonews PEPE has recorded a notable 23.73% increase in market capitalization over the past seven days and is now trading at $0.00001217. The token’s 24-hour trading volume stands at $5.87 billion, up 78.50% from the previous day. This surge in volume reflects a spike in market activity. As of today, PEPE’s market capitalization is $5.12 billion. Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), the second-largest meme token by market value, is also gaining traction. The token is currently trading at $0.00001329, up 14.9% over the past week and 0.6% in the last 24 hours. SHIB’s market capitalization is now $7.83 billion, ranking it 23rd in token market cap. Dogecoin ( DOGE ), the largest meme coin by market cap, is currently trading at $0.1982. It has risen 18.5% over the past seven days, reaching over $8.06 billion in market cap. Bonk ( BONK ) has captured significant market attention, with its price climbing 70% over the last 10 trading sessions. The token is currently priced at $0.00002719, reflecting a 6.27% increase in the past 24 hours. BONK’s market cap has climbed to $1.465 billion after gaining 33.9% in the past week. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) has also experienced a sharp resurgence. The token jumped 48.2% in the last seven days, lifting its market capitalization to $1.918 billion. The sudden momentum was amplified by a surprise social media endorsement from TRON founder Justin Sun, further fueling investor interest. Together, these developments point to a broader trend of capital rotation back into familiar meme coins, as traders seek stability and momentum within the increasingly saturated meme token market. Solana Tops Q2 Revenue at $271M, Outpaces Ethereum, Bitcoin & Tron Meanwhile, Solana itself continues to outshine its peers in core metrics. The blockchain generated over $271 million in revenue in Q2 2025, outpacing Ethereum, Tron, and Bitcoin for the third consecutive quarter, according to Blockworks.

Active addresses rose to 24.4 million, and fee revenue increased 44% to $7.68 million. Adding to the momentum is the anticipation around Solana ETFs. Polymarket data shows that traders now estimate a 99% chance that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot Solana ETF by the end of 2025. Bloomberg ETF analysts have sharply raised expectations for US approval of spot funds tracking Solana, Litecoin, and XRP. #ETFs #XRP https://t.co/dKK2ZIbW8c — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 1, 2025 Several major firms, including VanEck, Grayscale, 21Shares, and Bitwise, have already filed applications, signaling deep institutional interest. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart echoed the sentiment, saying , “We’re expecting a wave of new ETFs in the second half of the year. Solana is clearly leading that conversation.” Notably, Solana ( SOL ) is currently trading at $162.19, up 9.5% over the past 7 days. The token has also seen a sharp rise in trading activity, with 24-hour volume hitting $14.4 billion, a 133.4% increase from the previous day. Source: Cryptonews On July 12, analyst Ali Martinez shared a bullish outlook on Solana, highlighting a cup-and-handle pattern forming on the weekly chart, a classic bullish signal that often precedes major rallies. This is a critical level for Solana $SOL . A weekly close above $170 could ignite the next major bull run and open the gates to $2,000! pic.twitter.com/JjTaRdUL4h — Ali (@ali_charts) July 12, 2025 The pattern suggests that Solana has recovered from its past lows near $9.88, following a multi-year climb from its previous peak around $250. The recent price action appears to be forming the “handle” portion of the structure. Martinez points to $170 as a critical resistance level. A confirmed breakout above this level, particularly with a weekly close, could validate the pattern and trigger a strong upward move. Based on Fibonacci projections, potential price targets include $295 (a retest of the all-time high), with longer-term targets of $787, $1,314, and even $2,744. However, failure to break past $170 may lead to a pullback toward $135 or even $100, which has historically acted as strong support.

According to data from sources, Coinbase’s stock ended up 1.8% at $394.01 per share on the day. At the same time, shares hit a peak of $398.50. At today’s closing price, Coinbase has a market cap of nearly $100.36 billion, the highest market cap the crypto exchange has recorded in history. Bitwise CIO anticipates Coinbase becoming a trillion-dollar company at some point Coinbase shares have popped 50% in the past month alone in conjunction with the highly successful initial public offering (IPO) of Circle Internet Group and favorable regulatory changes in the United States. The crypto exchange also encountered a significant achievement on May 19 after adding it to the S&P 500 index. This milestone distinguishes Coinbase as the first cryptocurrency-focused company to gain entry into this benchmark, highlighting its growing legitimacy within the financial sector. This month, Coinbase experienced a steady increase in revenue that did not come from transactions in the last year, totaling $772 million in the first three months, according to analysis from sources. Last week, the company brought on a user named AlexOnchain to help increase its social media presence. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan had previously forecasted Coinbase’s significant milestone. Based on his anticipation, the firm could eventually become a trillion-dollar company. On May 13, in an X Post , Hougan advised investors to choose a company currently worth less than $100 billion but has the best chance of reaching a value of over $1 trillion . He gave Coinbase as an example, which is valued at $61 billion. Coinbase’s stock rebounds amid growing adoption of cryptocurrencies On June 26, Coinbase’s shares had also experienced a surge, closing at a record high in a rally that increased the embrace of cryptocurrencies on Wall Street and Washington. This came after the stock of the crypto exchange operator jumped 5.5% to $375.07. That surpasses the previous peak of $357.39 in November 2021, only a few months after the company became public with a direct listing. Notably, Coinbase shares have soared more than 1,000% from a record low in late 2022, when the failure of FTX had cast further doubt on the digital asset’s future. The stock’s rebound came as cryptocurrency prices recovered, and the industry itself secured powerful new allies, including President Trump, a strong crypto supporter who has embraced crypto stances in the US. Another important milestone that contributed to the crypto exchange’s share surge was after the US Senate approved legislation for stablecoins pegged to the dollar, which are considered a promising payment method. Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer highlighted the significance of stablecoins in the company’s operations. According to him, revenues generated from stablecoins will probably enable the company to reduce its dependence on trading revenue, which is under pressure from competition. Following trade analysis, Coinbase’s main source of revenue has emerged from stablecoins. Therefore, with these new regulations, the crypto exchange will achieve financial stability and continuous success. Republican House leaders are preparing to pass a stablecoin regulatory bill this week, aiming to send Congress’s first major piece of digital asset legislation to the president’s desk. The vote marks the beginning of what supporters are calling “Crypto Week” — a series of decisions that could reshape the crypto landscape in the US. The proposed legislation, backed by industry leaders, is expected to bolster the adoption of dollar-based stablecoins. If passed, it would represent a significant win for crypto proponents, who collectively invested hundreds of millions of dollars during the last election cycle to help install lawmakers favorable to digital asset innovation, according to Federal Election Commission data. “The golden age of digital assets is here,” said Rep. Bryan Steil (R-WI), a key industry ally and chair of the House crypto subcommittee. President Donald Trump, now prioritizing digital asset regulation in his second term, has vowed to make the United States the “crypto capital” of the world. His family’s involvement in crypto ventures — which has reportedly earned them hundreds of millions of dollars — has drawn criticism from Democrats, some of whom have pushed, unsuccessfully, to include prohibitions targeting Trump-affiliated crypto businesses in the legislation. The House is also set to vote this week on two additional industry-supported bills: one to establish comprehensive market structure rules for cryptocurrencies, and another to block the Federal Reserve from launching a digital currency.

Crypto Capital Inflows Are Currently Sitting At $51 Billion As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, there is a stark difference in capital participation between the current Bitcoin rally and the one from December 2024. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $118,000—But Liquidity Still Thin, Glassnode Warns Below is the chart shared by the analyst that compares the two bull runs. The graph captures the 30-day capital flows occurring for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the stablecoins. For the former two assets, it tracks them using the Realized Cap indicator. The Realized Cap is a capitalization model that calculates a given cryptocurrency’s total value by assuming that each coin in the circulating supply has its value equal to the last time it changed hands on the network. In short, what the metric represents is the amount of capital that investors of the asset as a whole have put into it. Changes in this indicator, therefore, correspond to the entry or exit of capital into the network. As is visible in the chart, the 30-day Realized Cap change for Bitcoin and Ethereum (colored in orange) has gone up alongside the latest price rally, indicating that capital has flowed into these coins. It’s also apparent that stablecoin flows (blue) have also noted an uptick, although the scale has been smaller. For stables, capital flow can be directly measured using the market cap, since their price is always pegged to $1 means that the Realized Cap never differs from the market cap. In the cryptocurrency sector, capital mainly comes in through three entry points: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins. The altcoins usually only receive a rotation of capital from these assets. Since the flows related to the three have recently been positive, the market as a whole has been getting an injection of capital. In total, the aggregate capital inflows for the cryptocurrency sector have stood at $51.2 billion for the past month. This is certainly a sizeable figure on its own, but it pales in comparison to what was witnessed before. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Breaks 8-Year Resistance Line That Failed In 2017-2021 As Martinez has highlighted in the chart, the monthly capital flows peaked at almost $135 billion in the December 2024 Bitcoin rally above $100,000, more than double the latest number. Something to keep in mind, however, is the fact that the previous run was more explosive, while the latest one has come in two waves: an initial recovery surge above $100,000 that led into a consolidation phase and the current breakout into the $120,000 levels. This could, at least in part, explain why the metric has appeared relatively cool recently. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $121,700, up nearly 3% over the last 24 hours.

Dolce & Gabbana USA Was Not Behind Failed NFT Project According to a July 11 ruling from Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald of the Southern District of New York, Dolce & Gabbana USA Inc. is cleared from the high-profile litigation as it is not an “alter ego” of its parent company, Dolce & Gabbana SRL, which was in charge of the NFT-focused “DGFamily” project. “The Court finds that plaintiff has not adequately alleged that D&G S.R.L. completely dominated D&G USA even if D&G S.R.L. allegedly shared some employees and office space with D&G USA,” the filing states in part. “For the foregoing reasons, D&G USA’s motion is granted,” Reice concludes. DGFamily NFT Project Slammed As Rug Pull In Lawsuit Filed in May and amended in September 2024 , the lawsuit alleges that Dolce & Gabbana US and its Italian counterpart abandoned the “DGFamily” NFT project and failed to deliver on the mission’s promises while retaining customer funds. According to the Dolce & Gabbana website, “DGFamily” supposedly provided access to exclusive drops and collaborations, digital wearables, physical products, and events hosted by the company. However, the litigation implies that the iconic fashion house’s digital asset venture was nothing more than a classic “rug pull.” 1/ Dolce&Gabbana and @UNXD_NFT announce the highly anticipated launch of the DGFamily community. 3 distinct Boxes + digital, physical, & experiential benefits that take holders on a journey between real life & the metaverse. https://t.co/JMmmWZuRPu https://t.co/sCWuIQSwnD pic.twitter.com/r5t0M3FfBs — Dolce & Gabbana (@dolcegabbana) February 21, 2022 “Each of Defendants’ misrepresentations and omissions were material because they were designed to, and did, entice the public into purchasing unregistered securities (DGFamily Products) which were barely more than a vehicle for the Defendants’ enrichment,” the lawsuit reads. “Either through reckless incompetence or greed, Defendants failed to deliver what they promised in exchange for purchasing their digital assets and abandoned their crypto project while retaining over $25 million used to fund the project,” it continues.

In a statement on its website, the California‑based maker of AI hardware stated that it has already applied to the US Commerce Department for the needed licenses to continue H20 shipments. Management expects approval “soon,” and said deliveries to Chinese buyers will follow quickly once the paperwork is complete. Alongside the resumption plan, Nvidia introduced an RTX Pro graphics processor that it calls “fully compliant” with current regulations. The chip is aimed at digital‑twin artificial‑intelligence work in smart factories, logistics hubs, and other industrial settings inside China. Chief Executive Jensen Huang has been trying to keep doors open in both Washington and Beijing. The company noted that Huang recently met Trump and several lawmakers in the capital before traveling to China for talks with officials there. The meetings, Nvidia said, were meant to promote cooperation on AI research and to underline the firm’s open‑source support. Hints of a scaled‑down H20 for China first surfaced in May. Nvidia had been preparing a scaled-down version to satisfy US export curbs on advanced semiconductors and chips. Those curbs had blocked the original H20 from being shipped to Beijing.. Nvidia had previously lost access to $50 billion China market During Nvidia’s last earnings call, Huang painted a bleak picture of the impact of US curbs on its shipments. “The fifty‑billion‑dollar China market is effectively closed to U.S. industry,” he told analysts. “As a result, we are taking a multibillion‑dollar writeoff on inventory that cannot be sold or repurposed.” The pressure intensified in April. According to Nvidia, the government informed the firm that even the H20 chip’s export would be limited. The decision halted sales at once, leaving no time for the company to clear back orders. U.S. officials pointed to concerns over national security over highly capable AI chips reaching a major geopolitical rival. Nvidia had created the H20 in response to earlier restrictions imposed in 2022 under President Joe Biden. That initial round barred the export of the company’s fastest AI accelerators to China. The H20 is a scaled-down design meant to stay within the allowed performance ceiling. Huang is not worried about China’s military using US tech The CEO returned to the theme in a recent CNN interview that aired Sunday, shortly before another planned trip to China. Huang sought to ease fears that Nvidia hardware might boost Chinese military projects. Huang mentioned that the US need not be concerned about the People’s Liberation Army using US tech because “they simply can’t rely on it.” He added that Washington could cut off access whenever it wants and pointed out that China already has enough computing power. Huang added, “They don’t need Nvidia’s chips, certainly, or American tech stacks in order to build their military.” His remarks come after years of measures in the Congress and the White House to curb shipments of advanced AI chips to Chinese customers. Huang again criticized that strategy, calling it counterproductive to America’s goal of maintaining leadership in cutting‑edge tech. “We want the American tech stack to be the global standard,” he told CNN. “In order for us to do that, we have to be in search of all the AI developers in the world.” He noted that about half of those developers are based in China.

A close above the $122,000 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $123,200 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $125,000 level. The main target could be $130,000. Downside Correction In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $120,500 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Immediate support is near the $117,500 level. The first major support is near the $115,800 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $108,636 swing low to the $123,140 high. The next support is now near the $114,000 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $112,500 support in the near term. The main support sits at $110,500, below which BTC might continue to move down. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $117,500, followed by $115,800.

However, exchange data shows a sharp increase in BTC inflows following this milestone, raising concerns of a potential short-term correction. Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Warn Of Pullback According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Tarekonchain, BTC is beginning to show signs of short-term cooling. Notably, exchange inflows recorded a sharp uptick right after Bitcoin hit its fresh ATH. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Ahead? DXY Breakdown Suggests Capital Shift To Risk-On Assets The following chart shared by the analyst highlights exchange netflows to spot platforms, with notable spikes in inflows to centralized exchanges. This typically indicates profit-taking behavior by short-term holders and some whales. Tarekonchain noted that such on-chain activity is usually indicative of a local top that could lead to a healthy price correction or consolidation in the coming days. They added: It’s a classic pattern we’ve seen after previous parabolic rallies – profits are realized, weak hands exit, and price finds a new base. That said, the analyst noted that despite the warning signs of a looming price correction, the overall market structure remains largely bullish. For instance, long-term holders are still holding their BTC, not keen on selling at current price levels. Supporting the bullish thesis, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continue to attract strong capital. For the week ending July 11, they saw $2.72 billion in net inflows – a clear sign of ongoing institutional interest. Whales Preparing To Sell? In a separate post, CryptoQuant contributor Crazzyblockk pointed to an uptick in whale activity on Binance. The Binance Whale Activity Score shows that deposits from large wallets have spiked dramatically. Related Reading: Bitcoin Uptrend Intact, But Binance Activity Warns Of Short-Term Pullback Whales reportedly deposited as much as 1,800 BTC to Binance in a single day, with more than 35% of transactions valued at over $1 million, hinting at strategic positioning ahead of expected volatility. Crazzyblockk highlighted two possible scenarios following the surge in deposits from large-scale investors. First, it is likely that these investors are sitting on healthy profits and may be getting ready to secure some gains after a historic run. Alternatively, they might be aiming to leverage Binance’s deep liquidity to hedge or open new positions as the market experiences heightened volatility. Either way, this sell-side pressure on Binance is likely to weigh on BTC’s bullish momentum. Despite rising inflows and increased whale activity, market sentiment remains broadly positive. Retail investor participation is still muted compared to previous bull runs, suggesting the current rally might still have room to grow. At press time, BTC trades at $119,449, up 0.8% in the past 24 hours.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $11.14. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $27.9 and $33.66, with an average value of $28.88. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2025 – 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.6384 Market Cap $1.11B Trading Volume $296.99M Circulating Supply 1.75B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.4005 (Jun 18, 2022) 24-hour High $0.6986 24-hour Low $0.6351 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 7.75% 50-Day SMA $0.6242 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 73 (Greed) Green Days 17/30 (57%) 200-Day SMA $0.9977 Optimism price analysis: TL;DR Breakdown: The daily chart shows a bearish breakdown below $0.640 support with a potential test of $0.560 zone. The critical resistance at $0.670 must be reclaimed to restore bullish momentum toward $0.720. Optimism 1-day price chart: OP faces rejection at $0.7 The OP/USDT daily chart for July 15 reveals a clear rejection from the $0.707 resistance level established a few days back, with subsequent selling pressure creating a lower high pattern that threatens the recent recovery narrative. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD indicator at 0.014 remains marginally positive but shows weakening momentum as the histogram bars compress, suggesting diminishing bullish conviction. The current close below $0.640 opens the door for a test of the $0.580-$0.560 support zone where previous consolidation occurred. Optimism 4-hour price chart: OP remains within a tight range The 4-hour signifies reduced volatility that typically precedes significant price movements. The upper Bollinger Band at $0.687 has been acting as dynamic resistance while the lower band at $0.631 provides immediate support, creating a narrow trading range that’s compressing further. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Volume patterns show the recent selling wave peaked around 180M but has since declined to 149.47M, suggesting exhaustion in the current bearish move. The price structure reveals a series of lower highs from the July 12th peak at $0.700, but the lack of decisive volume on the downside moves indicates this could be consolidation rather than the start of a major correction. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.6543 SELL SMA 5 $0.6870 SELL SMA 10 $0.6317 BUY SMA 21 $0.6029 BUY SMA 50 $0.6242 BUY SMA 100 $0.6868 SELL SMA 200 $0.9977 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.5952 BUY EMA 5 $0.6096 BUY EMA 10 $0.6416 SELL EMA 21 $0.6953 SELL EMA 50 $0.8368 SELL EMA 100 $1.0696 SELL EMA 200 $1.3624 SELL What to expect from Optimism? OP is at a make-or-break moment. If it can’t bounce back above $0.67, we’re likely heading down to $0.56. But if buyers step in and push it back above that level, we could see a solid push towards $0.72-$0.75. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up to $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

Optimism historic price sentiment Optimism price history by Coingecko OP launched with an initial value of $4.57 on May 31 but dropped sharply in June due to the UST stablecoin de-pegging and LUNA collapse, closing June at $0.5434. It further declined to $0.4147 by mid-July. In August, OP briefly surged above $1.90, but by mid-October, it dropped to $0.70 following the FTX collapse. In Q1 2023, OP surged past $3.00 during a crypto bull run but lost 66% shortly after. A recovery saw it close the year at $3.90. OP saw an eventful 2024, reaching an all-time high of $4.85 in March before sliding below $2.30 by mid-April. After a brief recovery to over $2.90 in May, it entered a bearish phase, trading at $1.82–$1.96 by July and $1.54–$1.62 by October. November brought a spark of hope with a peak at $2.60. OP closed December within the range of $1.611–$2.773. In January 2025, OP peaked at $2.18 but lost momentum, dropping to as low as $0.84 in February.

ETH is now consolidating gains and might correct lower toward the $2,900 zone. Ethereum started a fresh increase above the $3,000 level. The price is trading near $2,940 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2,980 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it remains supported above the $2,900 zone in the near term. Ethereum Price Rallies Above $3,000 Ethereum price started a fresh increase above the $2,800 zone, like Bitcoin . ETH price gained pace for a move above the $2,880 resistance zone and entered a positive zone. The bulls even pumped the price above $2,920. Finally, it tested the $3,080 zone. A high was formed at $3,081 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,905 swing low to the $3,081 high. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2,980 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading near $2,940 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $2,980 level. The next key resistance is near the $3,000 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,040 level. A clear move above the $3,040 resistance might send the price toward the $3,080 resistance. An upside break above the $3,080 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,200 resistance zone or even $3,220 in the near term. Are Downsides Supported In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,000 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,940 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,905 swing low to the $3,081 high.

July 10th registered the third-largest single-day inflow ever. This marks the 13th week in a row of inflows, raising the cumulative total to $21.8 billion, with year-to-date inflows hitting $22.7 billion. Assets under management surpassed the $200 billion milestone for the first time, reaching a record $211 billion. ETP trading volumes also surged to $29 billion, doubling the year’s typical weekly average. Investors Pour Billions into Bitcoin and Ethereum In the latest edition of the ‘Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report,’ CoinShares revealed Bitcoin investment products recorded $2.7 billion in inflows last week, which pushed the total assets under management (AuM) to $179.5 billion. Interestingly, this means Bitcoin now represents 54% of the AuM held in gold ETPs for the first time. Short Bitcoin ETPs remained quiet with minor inflows of $0.4 million. Ethereum extended its streak with a 12th consecutive week of inflows as it amassed $990 million, its fourth-largest on record. In relative terms, Ethereum’s inflows over 12 weeks equate to 19.5% of its AuM, thereby outperforming Bitcoin’s 9.8%. Solana followed with a strong $92.6 million in inflows, while Sui attracted $3.5 million. During the same period, multi-asset investment products saw $1.1 million in new capital, and Cardano pulled in $0.5 million. On the other hand, XRP led outflows with $104 million, while Chainlink noted $0.5 million in outflows. Regional flows showed the United States in a clear lead with $3.7 billion in inflows, while Switzerland and Canada posted $65.8 million and $17.1 million, respectively. Australia’s inflows stood at $1 million. Germany recorded the week’s largest outflows with $85.7 million. Sweden and Brazil followed with $15.7 million and $7.5 million in outflows. These strong inflows into digital assets have coincided with Bitcoin’s breakout. No Signs of Fatigue? According to QCP Capital, Bitcoin’s rally above $122,000 shows no signs of slowing. In an update, the firm noted that the market underestimated the strength of this parabolic breakout. A decisive technical move and rising institutional demand are driving the surge. To top that, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index jumped from 40 to 70 in three weeks. This signals a clear transition from fear to greed among investors. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw over $2 billion in net inflows last week, which is indicative of a growing institutional participation in the rally. Perpetual funding rates are also nearing 30% as leveraged long positions build while total open interest has crossed $43 billion, levels last seen in January. Despite the rally, implied volatility has not spiked as it usually does. Front-end implied vols rose but remain below last year’s average levels. One-month risk reversals are also flat, which points to little demand for immediate upside. However, September and December risk reversals show strong bids for calls, meaning investors are hedging long-term upside while managing near-term caution. Elevated funding rates also call for careful positioning amid market euphoria. QCP said that it remains structurally bullish on Bitcoin with macro and institutional support. However, it prefers positioning on a pullback rather than chasing the current rally.

According to him, cryptocurrencies like XRP and Ethereum could soon hold a bigger share of the market, especially in terms of assets managed through ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds). Currently, Bitcoin leads with around 5.6% of market share in ETFs, while Ethereum sits at about 3%. McClurg said it’s possible for XRP and ETH to reach around 6% in the future as more people start understanding how these assets work as financial tools. While Ripple, the company behind XRP, faced legal challenges over the years, it built strong partnerships worldwide. He said that Ripple is now well-positioned to compete with traditional financial systems like Fedwire, something that didn’t seem possible a few years ago. On the topic of investments, McClurg said that some investors will prefer ETFs for their simplicity and transparency, while others might go for companies holding cryptocurrencies like XRP as part of their treasury. He expects a mix of both, with some people choosing to invest directly in crypto-backed ETFs, while others might opt for companies managing digital assets. Overall, McClurg believes Ripple is one of the strongest contenders in the race to modernize financial transactions, and XRP could play a big role in this growing market. When asked about altcoin season, he added that while Bitcoin is expected to climb towards $140,000, some altcoins will follow, though not all will reach new highs. “I don’t see Solana or Ethereum breaking new all-time highs this year,” McClurg said. Instead, he said that newer tokens like SUI, Injective, and Axelar have a better chance of hitting fresh records. As for XRP, McClurg said its price movement will likely depend on ongoing legal and regulatory developments, but he does expect it to hit a new high for this year, even if not an all-time record.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,MARKET|XRP|ETH|REGULATION|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-15 04:20:01

Recently, DWF Labs , a major Web3 venture capital firm and market maker, received an astonishing 2.5 billion PUMP tokens. This colossal transfer, valued at approximately $17.4 million, originated from Pump.fun, the platform behind the token itself. This development has ignited widespread speculation, particularly regarding DWF Labs’ potential role as an early investor in the project. DWF Labs’ Strategic Move: What Does This PUMP Token Acquisition Mean? When a firm like DWF Labs makes such a substantial move, the crypto community takes notice. Known for its aggressive and strategic investments across various blockchain projects, DWF Labs often plays a pivotal role in the liquidity and market dynamics of the assets they touch. The receipt of 2.5 billion PUMP tokens from Pump.fun is not just a mere transaction; it’s a potential signal of deeper involvement and confidence in the project’s future. Here’s why this acquisition is particularly noteworthy: Scale of Acquisition: 2.5 billion tokens represent a significant portion, indicating a major stake. Direct Transfer from Source: The tokens came directly from Pump.fun, not through an open market purchase, which lends credence to the early investor theory. Market Impact: DWF Labs’ involvement can often bring increased visibility and liquidity to a token, potentially influencing its price trajectory. This event underscores DWF Labs’ continued influence in shaping the landscape of new and emerging crypto assets. Understanding the PUMP Token: A Closer Look at Its Market Debut The PUMP token is intrinsically linked to Pump.fun, a platform that has gained attention for its unique approach to token creation and distribution. Unlike traditional launches, Pump.fun allows users to create and launch their own tokens with minimal effort, often fostering a highly speculative and community-driven environment. The PUMP token itself serves as the native asset within this ecosystem, likely playing a role in governance, fees, or staking on the platform. The token recently made its debut on major exchanges, including Gate.io, where it is currently trading at approximately $0.005517. This listing provides broader accessibility for investors and marks a crucial step in the token’s journey towards wider adoption. The market’s reaction to the PUMP token’s listing and its subsequent price movements will be closely watched, especially now with DWF Labs’ visible involvement. Pump.fun’s Early Investors: Is DWF Labs Among Them? The speculation that DWF Labs might be one of Pump.fun ’s early investors stems from the nature and timing of the token transfer. Blockchain analytics platform LookOnChain, renowned for its on-chain sleuthing, first reported this transaction via X, highlighting the direct nature of the transfer from Pump.fun to DWF Labs. This type of direct allocation often signifies a pre-listing agreement or an early investment round. Being an early investor carries several implications: Favorable Terms: Early investors typically receive tokens at a much lower price, offering substantial upside potential. Strategic Partnership: It suggests a deeper strategic relationship between DWF Labs and Pump.fun, beyond just market making. Long-Term Commitment: A large early stake indicates a belief in the long-term viability and growth of the Pump.fun ecosystem. While official confirmation is awaited, the on-chain data strongly supports this hypothesis, painting a picture of a well-orchestrated strategic alliance. Navigating Crypto Investment: Insights from This Significant Token Transfer This event offers valuable lessons for anyone involved in crypto investment . The actions of major players like DWF Labs often provide insights into market trends, potential growth areas, and the dynamics of token distribution. For retail investors, understanding these large-scale movements can be crucial for informed decision-making. Key takeaways for investors: Follow On-Chain Data: Platforms like LookOnChain offer transparency into large transactions, revealing potential insider moves or strategic partnerships. Research Investor Profiles: Knowing which major firms are backing a project can be a strong indicator of its perceived value and potential. Understand Tokenomics: Grasping how a token is distributed, its utility, and its market cap helps in assessing its true value. While the allure of quick gains is strong, strategic crypto investment requires diligent research and an understanding of the underlying market mechanics. The Power of Blockchain Analytics: Uncovering Market Signals The very fact that this significant transfer came to light is a testament to the power of blockchain analytics . Platforms like LookOnChain tirelessly monitor public blockchain ledgers, identifying and reporting on large or unusual transactions. This transparency is a cornerstone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) world, allowing anyone with the right tools to trace the flow of assets. How blockchain analytics helps: Transparency: All transactions are recorded and immutable, allowing for public scrutiny. Early Warning System: Unusual transfers or wallet movements can signal upcoming events, such as listings, liquidations, or major investments. Market Intelligence: Analysts can derive valuable insights into whale behavior, institutional activity, and overall market sentiment. For both seasoned traders and curious enthusiasts, blockchain analytics serves as an indispensable tool for understanding the true pulse of the crypto market. Conclusion: A New Chapter for PUMP Token? The acquisition of 2.5 billion PUMP tokens by DWF Labs marks a significant milestone for both the token and the Pump.fun platform. Whether as an early investor or a strategic partner, DWF Labs’ involvement is likely to bring increased attention, potential liquidity, and perhaps even further development opportunities to the PUMP token ecosystem. This event highlights the intricate dance between emerging platforms and established crypto heavyweights, continually shaping the volatile yet exciting world of digital assets. As the PUMP token continues its journey on exchanges like Gate.io, the crypto community will be keenly watching how this massive acquisition influences its trajectory and the broader market.

The move has added more than 10% to its value over the past week, pushing the global cryptocurrency market valuation above $3.87 trillion, inching toward the $4 trillion mark. The current rally has reignited discussions around volume dynamics and accumulation patterns, as analysts monitor potential early signals that may influence near-term market behavior. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Reach $135,000 By September’s Close, Standard Chartered Forecasts Two contributors to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, BorisVest and Darkfost, have highlighted technical patterns that emerged before and during Bitcoin’s latest breakout. Their analyses suggest a combination of shrinking spot volume and surging accumulation activity may have played a role in driving prices higher. These insights provide a more nuanced view of the forces behind Bitcoin’s recent surge, particularly at a time when market participants weigh upside potential against the possibility of volatility in uncharted price zones. Volume Drop on Binance Preceded Breakout, Analyst Says According to BorisVest, a notable collapse in spot trading volume on Binance preceded Bitcoin’s move out of the $100,000 to $110,000 consolidation range. In his post titled “Binance Spot Volume Collapsed Before Bitcoin’s Breakout: Was It a Hidden Squeeze Signal?”, he explained that declining spot volumes often represent quiet periods of either accumulation or distribution. Binance, due to its liquidity depth and user base, is seen as a reliable proxy for broader crypto market behavior. BorisVest noted that once the breakout began, trading volume spiked sharply. While such spikes can indicate local tops or bottoms, in this case, the surge in volume did not trigger a reversal but instead accelerated the rally. “That’s a strong signal. If the move had no real backing, we would have seen a fast pullback. Instead, Bitcoin kept pushing higher,” he wrote. He emphasized that volume acts as a roadmap for identifying zones of trade concentration and potential shifts in sentiment, cautioning that while Bitcoin’s recent move appears structurally strong, market participants should be aware of the risks tied to high volatility zones. Accumulator Addresses Hit 2025 High Amid Price Surge In a separate update, CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost observed that Bitcoin “accumulator addresses,” wallets with a history of only buying and not selling BTC, have collectively acquired roughly 248,000 BTC in 2025 so far. This is well above the monthly average of 164,000 BTC, pointing to intensified buying activity in recent weeks. “These addresses have no history of distribution and their continued activity at current price levels indicates long-term positioning,” he said. Darkfost also cautioned that if Bitcoin enters a correction or consolidation phase, some of these wallets could begin selling, which would disqualify them as accumulators and potentially introduce significant selling pressure.

A recent announcement that has sent ripples through the digital asset world is the strategic move by global crypto exchange OKX to join Paxos’ Global Dollar Network . This collaboration marks a pivotal moment for the adoption and utility of the USDG stablecoin , promising enhanced liquidity and broader access for users worldwide. It underscores a growing trend of established financial players and innovative crypto platforms coming together to build a more robust and interconnected digital economy. Understanding Paxos’ Global Dollar Network: A Foundation for Digital Trust At its core, Paxos’ Global Dollar Network is an ambitious initiative designed to facilitate the instant, frictionless movement of digital assets, primarily stablecoins, across a global ecosystem. Think of it as a superhighway for digital dollars, enabling seamless transactions between financial institutions, businesses, and individuals. Paxos, a regulated blockchain infrastructure platform, has meticulously built this network with a focus on compliance, security, and efficiency. Regulated Framework: Paxos operates under stringent regulatory oversight, which provides a crucial layer of trust and stability, distinguishing its offerings from many other crypto projects. This regulatory clarity is vital for attracting institutional participants. Interoperability: The network aims to connect various financial systems, exchanges, and payment providers, fostering greater interoperability within the digital asset space. This means easier transfers and settlements across different platforms. Efficiency in Settlement: By leveraging blockchain technology, the Global Dollar Network can significantly reduce settlement times from days to mere seconds, leading to substantial cost savings and operational efficiencies for participants. Scalability: Designed to handle high volumes of transactions, the network is built to scale with the increasing demand for digital dollar settlements, ensuring its long-term viability and utility. The vision behind the Global Dollar Network is to create a truly global, real-time settlement system for digital currencies, fundamentally reshaping how value is transferred and managed in the digital age. This infrastructure is not just about moving stablecoins; it’s about building the rails for a future financial system where digital assets are integrated seamlessly into everyday commerce and finance. The Rise of USDG Stablecoin: A Pillar of Stability in a Volatile Market The USDG stablecoin is a central component of Paxos’ ecosystem and the Global Dollar Network. Unlike many other stablecoins, USDG is designed with a strong emphasis on regulatory compliance and transparency, aiming to be a truly reliable digital representation of the US dollar. Cointelegraph reported that since its launch in November 2024, the stablecoin has achieved a circulating supply in the region of $356 million. This rapid growth, even with a relatively recent launch, highlights the market’s demand for regulated and trustworthy stablecoin options. What makes USDG stablecoin particularly compelling? Full Backing: Every USDG token is 1:1 backed by US dollar deposits and US Treasury bills, held in segregated accounts with FDIC-insured US banks. This ensures that the value of USDG remains consistently pegged to the dollar, offering stability in the often-volatile crypto markets. Audited Transparency: Paxos regularly publishes attestations by a top accounting firm, verifying the full backing of USDG. This commitment to transparency builds confidence among users and institutions. Regulatory Compliance: As a regulated entity, Paxos ensures that USDG adheres to strict anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) standards, making it a preferred choice for institutional players and businesses seeking compliant digital asset solutions. Programmability: Like other digital assets, USDG can be integrated into smart contracts and decentralized applications, unlocking new possibilities for financial innovation, automated payments, and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The substantial circulating supply achieved by USDG stablecoin in such a short period is a testament to its robust design and the market’s increasing preference for regulated, transparent stablecoins. This growth trajectory positions USDG as a significant player in the competitive stablecoin landscape, offering a reliable alternative for users seeking a digital dollar they can trust. Why is OKX Joining Paxos’ Global Dollar Network a Game Changer for Crypto Exchange Users? The decision by OKX , one of the world’s leading crypto exchange platforms, to integrate with Paxos’ Global Dollar Network is a significant development with far-reaching implications for its vast user base. This partnership is not merely a technical integration; it represents a strategic alignment that promises enhanced liquidity, efficiency, and new opportunities for millions of users. Here’s how this collaboration benefits OKX users and the broader crypto ecosystem: Enhanced Liquidity for USDG: By integrating USDG into its platform, OKX immediately boosts the stablecoin’s liquidity, making it easier for users to buy, sell, and trade USDG. Increased liquidity leads to tighter spreads and better execution prices for traders. New Trading Pairs and Opportunities: The availability of USDG on OKX could lead to the introduction of new trading pairs, offering users more diverse trading strategies and access to different markets. This expands the utility of USDG beyond simple transfers. Faster and Cheaper Settlements: Leveraging the Global Dollar Network, OKX users can experience faster and potentially cheaper settlements for transactions involving USDG, especially for cross-border payments or large-volume trades. This efficiency is crucial for both retail and institutional traders. Increased Trust and Security: For OKX users, the partnership with a regulated entity like Paxos and the use of a fully backed stablecoin like USDG adds an extra layer of trust and security. This can be particularly appealing to institutional investors and businesses looking for compliant pathways into the crypto market. Seamless Integration: The integration is designed to be seamless for users, allowing them to access USDG and the benefits of the Global Dollar Network directly through their existing OKX accounts, without needing to navigate complex external systems. This move positions OKX at the forefront of adopting regulated digital assets, catering to a growing demand for secure and compliant financial instruments within the decentralized space. It signifies OKX’s commitment to providing its users with the best and most reliable tools for navigating the digital economy. The Broader Impact: Reshaping the Stablecoin and Digital Asset Landscape The collaboration between OKX and Paxos’ Global Dollar Network extends beyond the immediate benefits for their respective users; it has significant implications for the entire stablecoin and digital asset landscape. This partnership serves as a powerful example of how traditional finance principles can converge with blockchain innovation to create a more robust and accessible global financial system. Institutional Adoption: A Bridge to Traditional Finance One of the most profound impacts of this partnership is its potential to accelerate institutional adoption of digital assets. Traditional financial institutions often hesitate to engage with cryptocurrencies due to concerns about regulatory clarity, volatility, and counterparty risk. By offering a regulated stablecoin like USDG through a major crypto exchange like OKX, the partnership provides a more familiar and secure entry point for these entities. Reduced Risk: Regulated stablecoins minimize the risk associated with unbacked or less transparent digital assets, making them more palatable for risk-averse institutions. Compliance Pathways: The adherence to AML/KYC standards by Paxos offers clear compliance pathways, which are essential for banks, asset managers, and corporate treasuries looking to explore digital assets. Operational Efficiency: The Global Dollar Network’s ability to facilitate instant settlements can significantly improve the operational efficiency of institutional trading and treasury management, attracting more capital into the digital asset space. Competitive Dynamics in the Stablecoin Market The stablecoin market is highly competitive, dominated by giants like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). The entry of USDG stablecoin into the mainstream via OKX introduces a strong contender, emphasizing regulatory compliance and transparency as key differentiators. This could lead to a healthy competition that benefits users through improved services, lower fees, and greater trust.

Future of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Centralized Exchanges (CEX) The partnership highlights a growing trend of synergy between CEXs and the broader DeFi ecosystem. While OKX is a centralized exchange, its integration with a regulated stablecoin and network like Paxos’ can bring the benefits of institutional-grade assets to DeFi applications. This could lead to more robust and reliable DeFi protocols that leverage the stability and compliance of assets like USDG. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities for USDG and Crypto Exchanges While the partnership between OKX and Paxos’ Global Dollar Network presents immense opportunities, the path forward is not without its challenges. The rapidly evolving regulatory landscape and intense competition in the stablecoin market require continuous adaptation and innovation. Regulatory Headwinds and Clarity Stablecoins are increasingly under the scrutiny of regulators worldwide. While Paxos prides itself on its regulatory compliance, future regulations could impact the operational frameworks of both the Global Dollar Network and the USDG stablecoin . Navigating these evolving rules will be crucial for sustained growth and broader adoption. Clear and consistent regulatory frameworks are essential for stablecoins to reach their full potential as a bridge between traditional and digital finance. Competition and Market Dominance Despite its unique selling points, USDG faces stiff competition from established stablecoins with deep liquidity and widespread adoption. Gaining significant market share will require sustained efforts in marketing, user education, and strategic partnerships. The ability to differentiate USDG through superior features, lower transaction costs, or unique ecosystem benefits will be key. Scalability and Interoperability Beyond the Network While the Global Dollar Network is designed for scalability, the broader interoperability with diverse blockchain networks and traditional payment systems will be an ongoing challenge. Ensuring seamless transitions between different digital asset ecosystems and fiat on/off-ramps is vital for mass adoption. Opportunities for Innovation and Growth Despite the challenges, the opportunities are vast. The partnership opens doors for: New Financial Products: The stable and regulated nature of USDG can enable the creation of innovative financial products on OKX and other platforms, such as lending protocols, derivatives, and structured products. Cross-Border Payments: The efficiency of the Global Dollar Network, combined with OKX’s global reach, can revolutionize cross-border payments, making them faster, cheaper, and more transparent for businesses and individuals. Broader Digital Asset Integration: As more institutions and businesses adopt USDG, it could pave the way for wider acceptance of other digital assets in mainstream commerce and finance. For investors and businesses, the actionable insight is clear: closely monitor the development of regulated stablecoins like USDG. Their integration into major exchanges like OKX signals a maturing market where stability, compliance, and efficiency are becoming paramount. Diversifying stablecoin holdings to include regulated options can mitigate risks and open new avenues for investment and treasury management. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a More Integrated Crypto Future The strategic alliance between OKX and Paxos’ Global Dollar Network represents a transformative moment for the digital asset industry. By integrating the regulated USDG stablecoin , OKX is not just enhancing its own offerings but also contributing to the maturation of the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. This partnership exemplifies the growing convergence of traditional financial rigor and blockchain innovation, laying down a robust foundation for a future where digital assets are seamlessly integrated into global commerce and finance. The benefits are clear: enhanced liquidity, increased trust, greater efficiency, and new opportunities for both retail and institutional participants. While challenges remain, the commitment of major players like OKX and Paxos to build compliant and reliable infrastructure signals a powerful shift towards a more secure, accessible, and integrated digital economy. This collaboration is a testament to the industry’s relentless pursuit of innovation, promising a more stable and efficient financial future for all.

The Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) discussed how existing laws, regulations and risk-management protocols apply to crypto ‘safekeeping.’ The agencies clarified that the statement does not create any new supervisory expectations, emphasizing the need for stronger risk-management practices. “[The statement] reminds banks that provide or are considering providing safekeeping of such assets that they must do so in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.” @federalreserve @FDICgov @USOCC issue joint statement on risk-management considerations for crypto-asset safekeeping: https://t.co/1VFNYCx75T — Federal Reserve (@federalreserve) July 14, 2025 Banks Can Provide Crypto Custody in Two Forms: Fed Agencies The trio of agencies stressed that the proper way to custody such assets involves “controlling the cryptographic keys associated with the crypto-asset in a manner that complies with applicable laws and regulations,” a detailed 7-page memo read. Further, banks can offer crypto custody in two forms: fiduciary and non-fiduciary, they added. In a fiduciary arrangement, where banks are legally authorized to act on behalf of clients like a trustee, specific federal regulations (12 CFR 9 or 150) must be followed. Additionally, state laws and regulations, and any other applicable legal provisions, are also in place, the statement noted. For non-fiduciary services, banks are mandated to implement robust protections to safeguard customers’ digital assets. This includes protection against cyber threats, data loss and mismanagement of private keys. Fed Agencies’ Pivot From Previous Crypto Guidances US Fed agencies have previously restricted banks from easily engaging with crypto businesses under the Biden administration. In March, the current crypto-friendly President Donald Trump signed a long-awaited crypto order that sets a federal agenda meant to move U.S. digital assets businesses into friendly oversight. As a result, the FDIC officially removed “reputational risk” as a factor in bank supervision, creating a significant victory for the crypto space. The agency also issued new guidance that cleared the way for supervised banks in the US to engage in crypto-related activities without seeking prior approval. The @FDICgov revised its crypto policy, letting banks engage in digital asset services without prior approval. Oversight continues through post-notification reviews. #CryptoRegulation #FDIC https://t.co/lOsoTfKKtN — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 29, 2025 The latest statement from the agencies arrives on the first day of the U.S. House of Representatives’ self-described Crypto Week .

Recently, Binance made a pivotal move, announcing the Binance PUMP conversion of its PUMP pre-market perpetual contracts into standard perpetual contracts. This isn’t just a technical tweak; it’s a strategic enhancement designed to streamline trading and potentially unlock new opportunities for traders. What’s the Big Deal? Understanding the Binance PUMP Conversion The core of this announcement revolves around the shift of PUMP’s trading status on Binance. Previously, PUMP was available via pre-market perpetual contracts, a specific type of derivative designed for assets not yet fully launched or widely available for spot trading. These contracts often come with unique characteristics, including specific settlement mechanisms and potentially higher volatility due to limited liquidity and price discovery. The Binance PUMP conversion to standard perpetual contracts signifies a move towards greater market maturity and accessibility for the PUMP asset. This conversion means that PUMP perpetual contracts will now operate under the same rules and conditions as other established perpetual contracts on Binance, offering a more familiar and predictable trading environment. For traders, this translates into several key changes: Enhanced Liquidity: Standard perpetual markets typically attract a wider range of participants, leading to deeper order books and potentially tighter spreads. Simplified Trading: The complexities often associated with pre-market contracts, such as specific settlement periods or unique margin requirements, are typically removed. Broader Accessibility: More traders might feel comfortable engaging with PUMP now that it operates within a standard framework. Demystifying PUMP Perpetual Contracts: What Changes? To fully grasp the implications of this change, it’s essential to understand the difference between pre-market and standard PUMP perpetual contracts . Pre-market contracts are essentially bets on the future price of an asset before its official launch or widespread trading. They serve as a mechanism for early price discovery and speculative trading, but often come with caveats like: Limited Trading Windows: Often restricted to specific times. Unique Margin Requirements: Potentially higher initial margins or specific collateral. Settlement Procedures: Different rules for how contracts are settled upon the asset’s official listing. In contrast, standard perpetual contracts are derivative instruments that allow traders to speculate on the price of an underlying asset without owning the asset itself, and without an expiry date. They are characterized by: 24/7 Trading: Continuous trading availability. Funding Rates: A mechanism to keep the perpetual contract price close to the underlying spot price. Standardized Margin: Consistent margin requirements across various assets. The conversion ensures that PUMP perpetual contracts now align with these standard features, offering a more robust and liquid trading experience. This standardization is a crucial part of the broader Binance trading update , reflecting the exchange’s commitment to providing diverse yet user-friendly trading options. How This Binance Trading Update Benefits You The recent Binance trading update for PUMP is more than just a procedural change; it’s a move designed to enhance the overall trading experience and market efficiency. For active traders and long-term investors alike, the benefits are clear: Increased Liquidity and Price Stability: With PUMP now on standard perpetuals, we can expect a significant influx of liquidity. This means it will be easier to enter and exit positions without causing significant price slippage. Greater liquidity also often leads to more stable and predictable price movements, reducing the impact of large individual orders. Enhanced Accessibility and Familiarity: Traders accustomed to standard perpetuals on Binance will find the PUMP market much more intuitive. This ease of access can attract more participants, further deepening the market. It removes the learning curve associated with specialized pre-market contracts, making PUMP more approachable. Improved Arbitrage Opportunities: As liquidity grows and the contract behaves more like a standard perpetual, arbitrage opportunities between PUMP’s perpetual contract and any potential future spot market or other derivative markets may become more consistent and viable for sophisticated traders. This strategic decision by Binance underscores its commitment to fostering a dynamic and accessible trading environment for its users, ensuring that even newer assets like PUMP can quickly integrate into the mainstream of crypto perpetuals trading. Navigating Crypto Perpetuals: A Strategic Move for Traders For anyone engaged in the world of crypto perpetuals , this conversion represents a key development that demands attention. The transition of PUMP from a niche pre-market offering to a standard perpetual contract integrates it more fully into the broader ecosystem of derivatives trading. Traders now have a more direct and standardized way to gain exposure to PUMP’s price movements, utilizing familiar tools and strategies. Actionable Insights for Traders: Re-evaluate Strategies: If you were trading PUMP pre-market, review your strategies. The new liquidity and behavior of standard perpetuals might require adjustments to your entry/exit points, stop-loss orders, and overall risk management. Monitor Funding Rates: Standard perpetual contracts involve funding rates. Understand how these rates work for PUMP, as they can impact the cost of holding positions over time. Leverage with Caution: While increased liquidity can make leverage seem less risky, the inherent volatility of crypto markets remains. Always use leverage responsibly and understand the liquidation risks. Look for Arbitrage: As PUMP becomes more liquid, keep an eye on potential price discrepancies between its perpetual contract and any future spot listings or other platforms, if applicable. This strategic shift provides a robust framework for traders to engage with PUMP, leveraging the familiar mechanics of standard perpetual contracts to potentially maximize their trading outcomes. The Future of Pre-Market Trading and Beyond While the focus here is on PUMP’s transition, this event also prompts a broader discussion about the role of pre-market trading on major exchanges like Binance. Pre-market offerings serve a crucial function in the crypto ecosystem by allowing early price discovery and liquidity for nascent projects. They provide a bridge between an asset’s initial hype and its full market debut. Binance’s decision to convert PUMP indicates a maturation path for assets that successfully navigate their pre-market phase. It suggests that once an asset demonstrates sufficient interest and stability, it can transition to a more conventional, liquid trading environment. This process can be seen as a positive sign for the ecosystem, indicating a structured approach to bringing new assets into mainstream trading. This conversion might set a precedent for how other successful pre-market listings will be handled in the future, fostering a more predictable and streamlined journey for new tokens from their initial offering to becoming fully integrated into the broader crypto derivatives landscape. Conclusion: Seizing the Opportunity in the New PUMP Landscape The Binance PUMP conversion from pre-market to standard perpetual contracts is a significant development for the PUMP token and its trading community. It marks a strategic move by Binance to enhance liquidity, simplify trading, and integrate PUMP more deeply into its extensive derivatives ecosystem. This Binance trading update provides a more robust and familiar environment for traders, aligning PUMP with the widely adopted structure of crypto perpetuals . For traders, this means more predictable trading conditions, potentially tighter spreads, and greater accessibility. It’s an opportune moment to reassess your trading strategies for PUMP, taking advantage of the increased liquidity and standardized mechanics. While the benefits are clear, remember to approach trading with caution, understanding the inherent risks of volatile crypto markets. This event underscores Binance’s ongoing efforts to innovate and refine its offerings, ensuring its platform remains at the forefront of the digital asset trading world. The future of PUMP trading, now firmly rooted in the standard perpetuals market, looks set for a more streamlined and liquid journey.

The price of BTC surpassed $120,000 for the first time in its history. According to Binance data, BTC continued to break records during the day yesterday and broke a new record by surpassing $123,000. However, this upward momentum was short-lived. After reaching a record high of $123,000, Bitcoin's price began to decline, falling to $117,000. This decline was also reflected in altcoins. Ethereum (ETH) fell below $3,000 again, dropping to $2,950. XRP fell 2.4% in the last 24 hours, Solana (SOL) fell 4.4%, and Dogecoin (DOGE) fell 6.6%. Analysis firm Alphractal stated that this decline was due to reduced buying pressure and selling pressure from investors seeking to take profits. Stating that this decline is normal, Alphractal stated that the current phase represents a natural correction phase and should be monitored carefully until the market stabilizes. Alphractal CEO Joao Wedson also stated that he expects a short-term correction. He noted that the downward trend could continue for some time, predicting that the BTC price could drop to as low as $108,000 before rising to $143,000-$148,000. “Short-term outlook for BTC: $115,000 seems inevitable, but a drop to $108,000 is still on the table before a potential rally to $143,000-$146,000 if momentum picks up. *This is not investment advice.

On Monday, on its “List-a-Thon” livestream, the platform announced it will be adding stocks of major US companies like Nike (NKE), McDonald’s (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), Coca-Cola (KO), Uber, and Yum! Brands (YUM). The platform now offers 37 equities to EU users following its earlier launches of tokenized stocks in late June and July 3. Gemini boosts EU market access with 21 new tokenized stocks across top sectors Gemini’s official blog highlights the latest stock additions as a major step forward in expanding its offerings for European users. The platform included 21 new equities on July 3, like Apple, Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, and crypto companies such as Coinbase and Marathon Digital (MARA) Holdings. Not too far from its initial launch of Strategy tokenized stocks, on June 27, for EU investors. Gemini’s latest addition includes 14 stocks across diverse industries, strengthening portfolio flexibility for EU investors. It includes popular brands like Nike, known for its athletic wear; McDonald’s, a global fast-food powerhouse; Starbucks, the coffeehouse leader; Coca-Cola, a beverage industry icon; and Yum! Brands, the parent of major chains like KFC, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut. The platform has now grown to encompass some SaaS giants like Cisco (CSCO), Adobe (ADBE), Snowflake (SNOW), and Hut 8 (HUT) as well. On the travel front, it gained significant players with Delta Air Lines (DAL), Booking Holdings (BKNG), Uber (UBER), Carnival Corporation (CCL), and Rocket Lab. Gemini is maintaining its relationship with Dinari, the issuer of dShares™—tokenized financial instruments that track the value of US equities 1:1 and provide the same economic rights, subject to legal limitations. Dinari manages token issuance , with tokens minted on the Arbitrum network for optimized performance. These tokenized stocks are available 24/7 on Gemini, charging a 1.49% trading fee. US-based crypto exchange and custodian service Gemini is bolstering its lineup of tokenized assets with the addition of BlockFi Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) funds. Token issuance is managed by Dinari, where tokens are minted on the Arbitrum chain to be more efficient. Gemini provides 24/7 trading availability for these tokenized stocks while charging a 1.49% fee per transaction. Gemini Intergalactic EU Artemis, Ltd, an entity authorized and regulated by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA), rolled out these stock offerings. Robinhood’s tokenized product is still under regulatory scrutiny Other firms are also moving into tokenized equities following Gemini’s lead. Robinhood, for example, debuted its “Stock Tokens” product to European customers on June 30, with as many as 215 stock tokens being issued on the Arbitrum Layer 2 network. But the launch has been met with setbacks, since the product is still facing regulatory scrutiny. Stock tokens are considered products in the stocks of companies like OpenAI and SpaceX. However, OpenAI has publicly disavowed the service and has raised further concerns. After Robinhood made the announcement, OpenAI warned users that the tokens are not real OpenAI equity, stressed it was not in any way connected with Robinhood, and emphasized that any valid transfer of its equity must receive prior written approval, which it did not. Recently, Lithuania’s central bank even asked Robinhood to clarify its tokenized equities further, following OpenAI’s response. The bank made it clear that only after the platform responds will they be able to evaluate the legality and compliance of the product. Addressing OpenAI’s comments, Vlad Tenev, CEO of Robinhood, only maintained that their tokenized product opens up access for retail investors by offering indirect exposure, a structure enabled by their investment in a special purpose vehicle. Meanwhile, Kraken and Bybit have also launched their tokenized offerings. Kraken now offers stock trading via interfaces modeled after standard crypto pairings, while Bybit offers its xStocks on both its TradFi and decentralized “Byreal” platforms.

While SHIB aims for a realistic price target of $0.00005, Ozak AI, currently priced at just $0.005 in its fourth presale stage, is eyeing the $1 milestone, which would represent an extraordinary 200x surge. The question facing investors is clear: which one holds the stronger upside potential by the end of 2025? Shiba Inu’s Steady Climb Toward $0.00005 Shiba Inu is one of the most recognizable meme coins within the crypto space. Originally launched as a playful opportunity to Dogecoin, SHIB has developed into a full-fledged ecosystem with its very own decentralized exchange (ShibaSwap), and even plans for a Layer-2 network referred to as Shibarium. As of now, SHIB trades at around $0.00001321, displaying resilience in market dips and keeping strong network support. Analysts recommend that SHIB may want to attain $0.00005 in 2025 under favorable conditions. For this goal to materialize, the overall market needs to enter a strong bull cycle, and Shiba Inu needs to deliver on its roadmap guarantees, especially in utility and adoption. If Shibarium achieves scalability and adoption amongst builders or users, it can deliver real use cases that push demand higher. However, SHIB is still heavily reliant on social sentiment and community-pushed hype. Unlike tokens with deeper essential backing, SHIB’s path to major price boom depends largely on viral traits, strategic burns of supply, and consistent interest from influencers. Although hitting $0.01 remains a distant dream, the $0.00005 goal is in the realm of opportunity, in particular if macroeconomic elements align in crypto’s choice. Youtube embed: Next 500X AI Altcoin Ozak AI’s Breakout Potential Toward $1 On the opposite end of the spectrum is Ozak AI —a project deeply rooted in utility, offering a real use case that merges blockchain infrastructure with AI-powered financial insights. Ozak AI’s platform includes components like the Ozak Stream Network (OSN), Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN), customizable AI prediction agents, and data vaults. These tools aim to empower both retail and institutional traders with high-quality predictive analytics derived from real-time data. Ozak AI is currently in its fourth Ozak AI presale stage, priced at just $0.005. With over $1.3 million already raised, the project has attracted early interest and is listed on both CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko . If Ozak AI gains market traction and delivers on its promises, a $1 price target would represent a staggering 200x return for current investors. Unlike SHIB, which relies heavily on meme power and community engagement, Ozak AI offers a more structured, innovation-driven investment case. Its architecture is designed for scalability and real-world integration—making it attractive to traders, analysts, and even institutions that are looking for smarter tools powered by artificial intelligence. If AI adoption continues to grow across industries, Ozak AI could be well-positioned to capitalize on this trend within the crypto space. Who Holds the Upper Hand Going Into 2025? Both SHIB and Ozak AI cater to different investor appetites. SHIB represents the nostalgia and momentum of the meme coin era, still capable of delivering short-term surges and driven by an extremely passionate community. But it also comes with risks tied to volatility and speculation, as it lacks substantial utility that would anchor its long-term value. Ozak AI, on the other hand, brings disruptive potential by offering predictive AI tools within a decentralized framework. As investors increasingly look beyond hype toward real innovation, Ozak AI’s fundamentals may provide a more solid foundation for sustained growth. The project’s ambitious goal of reaching $1 isn’t just based on hope—it’s rooted in an expanding market demand for AI-integrated financial tools. While Shiba Inu may succeed in hitting $0.00005 with continued community support and favorable market conditions, Ozak AI presents a more intriguing value proposition for those seeking exponential returns. The combination of AI utility, a growing presale, and early exposure at $0.005 makes Ozak AI one of the more compelling tokens to watch. Whether investors prefer meme power or machine learning, 2025 is shaping up to be a breakout year for both—but the smarter bet may lie in the AI-driven future that Ozak AI is building. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based crypto task that provides an innovative platform that focuses on predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized community technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to help crypto lovers and corporations make the perfect choices.

For years, traditional financial institutions, particularly banks, have eyed digital assets with a mix of fascination and caution. The primary hurdle? A distinct lack of clear, comprehensive rules. But now, a significant step forward has been taken, promising a new era of US crypto regulation . Imagine the relief for banks looking to dip their toes into the digital asset ocean! The Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) have collectively released a pivotal joint “blue paper.” This document isn’t just another piece of bureaucratic text; it’s a foundational guide, outlining how lending institutions are expected to manage their bank crypto holdings . It aims to demystify the regulatory landscape, providing much-needed expectations for banks engaging with digital assets. This move is a testament to the growing recognition of crypto’s permanence and the urgent need for a structured approach. What Exactly Is This Landmark Digital Asset Guidance? This joint paper, a collaborative effort from three of the most influential financial regulators in the United States, serves as a crucial framework for financial institutions. It’s designed to ensure that banks, as they explore or expand their involvement with cryptocurrencies, do so in a safe and sound manner. Think of it as a comprehensive playbook for navigating the complexities of digital assets, covering everything from custody to risk management. A Unified Stance: For the first time, these three key agencies have presented a united front, signaling a harmonized approach to crypto oversight. This eliminates much of the guesswork banks previously faced when dealing with disparate or ambiguous directives. Focus on Risk Management: The core of the guidance revolves around identifying and mitigating risks associated with crypto activities. This includes operational risks, liquidity risks, cyber risks, and compliance risks, ensuring banks maintain robust frameworks. Clarity for Diverse Activities: Whether a bank is considering holding crypto on its balance sheet, offering crypto custody services, or facilitating client crypto transactions, the paper provides clarity on the supervisory expectations for each activity. This isn’t just about setting rules; it’s about fostering responsible innovation within a secure financial system. The paper emphasizes that banks must possess the necessary expertise, infrastructure, and risk management systems before engaging in crypto-related activities. Why Was Regulatory Clarity So Urgently Needed for Bank Crypto Holdings? For years, the absence of clear directives left many banks in a state of paralysis. The potential for innovation and new revenue streams was evident, but the fear of regulatory backlash or unforeseen risks loomed large. This created a significant barrier to entry for mainstream financial institutions into the crypto space. Consider the landscape prior to this release: Aspect Before Joint Paper After Joint Paper (Expected) Regulatory Certainty Fragmented, ambiguous, or non-existent guidance. High legal and compliance risk. Unified, explicit guidelines from top regulators. Reduced uncertainty. Bank Engagement Hesitation, limited pilot programs, “wait-and-see” approach due to fear of regulatory penalties. Clearer path for strategic engagement, potential for broader adoption of crypto services. Risk Management Banks developing internal, often inconsistent, risk frameworks for crypto. Standardized expectations for robust risk management, aligning with traditional banking principles. Market Perception Crypto often viewed as a risky, speculative asset class, separate from mainstream finance. Increased legitimization of digital assets, paving the way for broader institutional acceptance. This regulatory clarity is not just beneficial for banks; it’s a crucial step for the entire digital asset ecosystem. It signals a maturation of the market and a recognition by traditional financial gatekeepers that crypto is here to stay and needs to be integrated responsibly. What Role Does the Federal Reserve Crypto Stance Play in This? The involvement of the Federal Reserve is particularly significant. As the central bank of the United States, the Fed’s stance carries immense weight, influencing monetary policy, financial stability, and the overall banking system. Their participation in this joint paper underscores the seriousness with which digital assets are now being viewed at the highest levels of financial governance. The Federal Reserve has previously expressed a cautious but open approach to digital currencies, exploring concepts like a central bank digital currency (CBDC) while also highlighting the risks associated with private stablecoins and other crypto assets. Their presence in this joint guidance suggests a concerted effort to: Maintain Financial Stability: Ensuring that the integration of crypto into the banking system does not introduce systemic risks that could jeopardize the broader financial system. Promote Sound Practices: Guiding banks to adopt best practices for managing digital assets, similar to how they manage traditional assets, but with an understanding of crypto’s unique characteristics. Foster Responsible Innovation: Creating an environment where banks can innovate with digital assets while adhering to robust regulatory standards. The Fed’s involvement essentially gives this guidance a powerful seal of approval, signaling to the banking sector that engaging with crypto is no longer a wild west endeavor but a regulated frontier. How Does This Digital Asset Guidance Empower Banks? This guidance offers more than just rules; it offers a roadmap for banks to confidently navigate the digital asset space. For financial institutions that have been on the sidelines, waiting for clearer signals, this paper is a green light to explore and potentially offer crypto-related services. It transforms uncertainty into opportunity. Key Empowerment Aspects: Reduced Compliance Risk: With explicit guidelines, banks can develop compliance frameworks that align directly with regulatory expectations, minimizing the risk of penalties or enforcement actions. Strategic Planning: Banks can now integrate crypto strategies into their long-term business plans, allocating resources, and building infrastructure with a clearer understanding of the regulatory boundaries. Enhanced Client Services: The ability to offer regulated crypto services, such as custody or trading, can attract new clients and retain existing ones who are increasingly interested in digital assets. Competitive Edge: Early movers who adapt quickly to these guidelines and build robust crypto offerings may gain a significant competitive advantage in the evolving financial landscape. This is not to say that the path will be entirely smooth. Banks will still face challenges, including the need for specialized talent, significant technology investments, and continuous adaptation to a rapidly evolving market. However, the foundational digital asset guidance provides a strong starting point. What’s Next for US Crypto Regulation and Banking? This joint paper is undoubtedly a significant milestone, but it’s important to view it as a beginning, not an end. The regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving, and this guidance lays the groundwork for future, more detailed rules and policies. Looking Ahead: Further Rulemaking: Expect more specific rules and regulations to emerge from these agencies, building upon the principles outlined in this initial guidance. This could include capital requirements for crypto exposures, specific consumer protection rules, and detailed operational standards. Industry Adaptation: Banks will need to invest heavily in understanding and implementing these guidelines. This includes training staff, upgrading systems, and potentially forming partnerships with crypto-native firms. Global Harmonization: As the US moves towards clearer regulation, it could influence other jurisdictions to follow suit, potentially leading to more harmonized global standards for crypto. Continued Dialogue: The regulators have emphasized that they will continue to monitor the market and engage with stakeholders, suggesting an iterative approach to regulation. For financial institutions, the actionable insight is clear: don’t wait. Begin assessing your current capabilities, identify potential gaps in your risk management and compliance frameworks, and prepare to integrate these new expectations into your operations. This proactive approach will be key to thriving in the new era of regulated bank crypto holdings . A New Era of Regulatory Clarity Dawns The release of this joint paper by the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC marks a monumental moment for both traditional finance and the cryptocurrency industry. It signifies a decisive shift from ambiguity to a structured framework for managing digital assets within the banking sector. This landmark US crypto regulation provides the much-needed regulatory clarity that banks have been craving, enabling them to confidently explore and engage with the burgeoning digital asset space. While challenges remain, the foundation has been laid for a more secure, stable, and integrated financial future where digital assets play a recognized role. This move not only legitimizes crypto further but also promises to unlock new avenues for innovation and growth within the regulated financial system. It’s an exciting time to watch how this guidance shapes the next chapter of finance.

The drop is largely due to a rapid increase in Pi’s circulating supply, weak demand, and low market liquidity. While Bitcoin enjoys the spotlight in this bull run, Pi Coin is struggling to keep up, and some in the community now fear the worst. Why Pi Network Price Today Remains Low Despite Mainnet Growth? Many Pi supporters admit they would love to see Pi hit $10 someday. But for this bull market, that dream is slipping further away. One of the biggest challenges facing Pi right now is the rapid increase in its circulating supply. With mobile mining rewards continuously being unlocked and more tokens migrating from testnet to mainnet, supply is growing faster than demand. This has led to over $37 million worth of Pi tokens getting migrated to the mainnet. But despite this growth, the price of Pi Coin is stuck near its lowest levels, trading around $0.45. Low Liquidity and Developer Inaction Weigh Heavily on Pi Coin Value The Pi community believes that rising supply , along with low market liquidity, is the main reason Pi is struggling to grow. There’s very little buying interest, and not enough liquidity to support price gains. On top of that, the project is facing criticism for limited support from the developer team. Many feel the Core Team is not giving enough space for community developers to contribute, which could be slowing innovation and shaking investor confidence. Pi Coin Technical Analysis Signals More Downside Ahead On higher time frames, the Pi price chart is showing lower lows, often a warning sign of further downside. When Bitcoin surged past $122,000 recently, Pi only touched $0.53 before crashing back down to $0.45 . However, Pi is currently trapped under the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement zone, suggesting it may continue to slide unless demand picks up. The next support lies around $0.40, a level which hasn’t been touched since the beginning of June. Pi Coin Forecast: Recovery Ahead or a Prolonged Crypto Winter? Despite the gloomy outlook, some see this dip as a rare opportunity. While others fear the end, a few view it as a time to accumulate. But with scammers outpacing community trust, engagement dropping, and more unlocks on the way, Pi’s short-term future looks shaky. The question now is: can Pi recover from this deep correction, or is this the beginning of a longer winter?",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|MINING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-15 05:26:20

SOL price is now correcting gains and might find bids near the $155 support zone SOL price started a fresh upward move above the $155 and $160 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $162 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $162 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $162 resistance zone. Solana Price Corrects Gains Solana price started a decent increase after it cleared the $160 resistance, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL climbed above the $162 level to enter a short-term positive zone. However, the price is facing a major hurdle at $168 and $169. A high is formed at $168.60 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $158 swing low to the $168 high. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $162 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading below $162 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. It is also trading below the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $158 swing low to the $168 high. The price is now approaching the $158 support. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $160 level. The next major resistance is near the $162 level. The main resistance could be $1685. A successful close above the $168 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $178. Any more gains might send the price toward the $185 level. More Losses in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $162 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $158 zone. The first major support is near the $155 level. A break below the $155 level might send the price toward the $150 zone. If there is a close below the $150 support, the price could decline toward the $145 support in the near term.

The legislation addresses central bank digital currencies, regulatory clarity for digital assets, and stablecoin frameworks. The proceedings already caused heated debates. Democrats like Rep. Maxine Waters and Rep. Jim McGovern criticised the bills for favoring Trump-linked crypto ventures and wealthy investors over consumer protections. Meanwhile, US regulators also issued joint guidance warning banks about the legal and operational risks of crypto custody services. Crypto Week Begins The US House of Representatives is set to deliberate on a series of key cryptocurrency bills this week as part of what Republican lawmakers call ”crypto week.” The legislative focus will be on three major proposals: the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act, and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act. These bills target issues related to central bank digital currencies, digital asset regulatory frameworks, and payment stablecoins. The House Committee on Rules, led by Republicans, first met on Monday to review the proposed amendments. (Source: Committee on Rules ) Among the most contentious developments are the series of amendments that were introduced by Democratic lawmakers. Representative Maxine Waters, a leading Democratic voice on financial regulation, submitted four alternative versions of the GENIUS Act. In her op-ed on MSNBC, she criticized the current bills as being crafted by and for the crypto industry rather than for consumer protection. Waters specifically raised concerns about President Donald Trump’s alleged conflicts of interest through his family-linked crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, which includes the USD1 stablecoin and the TRUMP meme coin. One of her proposed amendments is to ban US presidents, vice presidents, members of Congress, and their immediate families from holding or promoting cryptocurrencies. She also suggested the Treasury Secretary should be restricted from recognizing any foreign nation as having a comparable stablecoin regime if its leader referred to themselves as a dictator. This is likely a reference to El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele. On the Republican side, Representative Warren Davidson proposed an amendment to reinforce the right of individuals to self-custody digital assets through hardware or software wallets. Representative French Hill of Arkansas, chair of the House Financial Services Committee, fully supports the upcoming legislation, and stated that it will enhance investor protections while also cementing the US as a global leader in crypto innovation. With only eight legislative days remaining before the August recess, the timeline for final votes is tight. If the House moves quickly, floor votes on the bills could take place before lawmakers depart for the summer break. Democrats Slam Crypto Bills When crypto week’s first session began, it very quickly veered away from digital assets and into broader disputes over defense spending. Massachusetts Representative Jim McGovern opened with a scathing critique of the GOP’s legislative push, referring to the GENIUS, the CLARITY Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act as a “crypto giveaway.” He warned that the bills offer ineffective regulations because they benefit wealthy individuals and Trump-affiliated ventures at the expense of retail investors. McGovern mocked the notion of public demand for these bills by stating that no one in his district had asked him to make it easier for “crypto millionaires to get richer.” On the other side, Republican Representative Virginia Foxx defended the initiatives, especially the GENIUS Act, by calling it historic legislation that would position the US as a global leader in financial innovation. Foxx explained that the bill supports responsible development in the crypto space and could enhance America's standing in the global financial system. Despite Republican enthusiasm, the narrow majority in the House means that bipartisan support will likely be essential to actually advance the bills. Democratic lawmakers, including Representative Maxine Waters and Senator Adam Schiff, have expressed strong opposition, particularly over Trump's potential conflicts of interest via his family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, and its associated stablecoin, USD1. While the meeting was expected to focus on crypto regulation, the committee’s debate shifted toward discussions on the Department of Defense Appropriations Act. Still, House leaders made it very clear they intend to return to crypto issues soon and hope to pass the three bills before the August congressional recess. Regulators Warn Banks on Crypto Custody Meanwhile, three major US financial regulators—the FDIC, OCC, and Federal Reserve—jointly issued a document with details about the key risks banks face if they choose to custody crypto assets for clients. Part of the document that was shared by regulators While the guidance does not introduce new rules, it provides a risk framework for banks considering entry into the crypto sector. The document pointed out that banks must understand the complexities of digital assets, manage legal and compliance responsibilities, and remain accountable for any third-party custodians they employ. It also stresses the importance of robust audit programs, either internal or external, to ensure safe handling of crypto assets. The guidance was issued at a time when traditional financial institutions are showing more and more interest in crypto. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that a group of large banks is in early discussions to launch a joint stablecoin. Additionally, regulators have signaled a much more open stance toward crypto services by removing the “reputational risk” standard and issuing letters of approval for client-directed crypto transactions. At the same time, crypto-native firms like Ripple and Circle are looking to become regulated banks, which will just blur the lines between traditional banking and the digital asset economy even more.

Currently, all eyes are on the PUMP token , which has been demonstrating a fascinating resilience and unique market behavior since its inception. While many new tokens experience wild price swings, PUMP has maintained an unexpected stability, prompting leading on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X to delve deeper into the underlying metrics driving its performance. What makes PUMP different, and why are so many eyes on its journey in the volatile crypto market ? Unpacking PUMP Token’s Remarkable Market Performance The initial insights into the PUMP token ’s market activity paint a compelling picture of strategic planning and community engagement. According to the detailed analysis, the project team initiated the journey with a substantial $4 million in initial liquidity. This was not a one-time injection but rather added in multiple batches, a move that often signals a more thoughtful and long-term approach to market stability rather than a quick pump-and-dump scheme. This foundational liquidity is crucial for any new digital asset, providing a bedrock for trading and reducing extreme volatility in its early stages. What’s even more remarkable is how this initial capital has blossomed. Total liquidity for PUMP has surged to an impressive $50 million. This significant growth, as highlighted by the analyst, is predominantly fueled by the participation of retail investors . This isn’t just a number; it’s a testament to the organic interest and confidence from individual participants who are choosing to put their capital into PUMP. Such grassroots support is often a stronger indicator of a project’s health and potential longevity than mere institutional backing, as it reflects genuine belief from the wider community. Key Liquidity Milestones: Initial Liquidity Provided by Team: $4 million (added in multiple batches) Current Total Liquidity: $50 million (largely from retail participants) Furthermore, a substantial 24% community and ecosystem airdrop allocation is still pending announcement. This future distribution mechanism is a powerful tool for fostering a decentralized community, rewarding early adopters, and encouraging wider adoption. The anticipation of this airdrop could also be contributing to the sustained interest and holding behavior among current token holders, as they await potential benefits and further decentralization of the token’s supply. The Power of Retail Investors in the Crypto Market The narrative around PUMP is heavily influenced by the robust engagement of retail investors . In the broader crypto market , retail participation is a double-edged sword: it can drive massive rallies but also exacerbate crashes. However, in PUMP’s case, it appears to be a source of consistent strength. The fact that a significant portion of the $50 million in total liquidity comes from individual participants suggests a decentralized and resilient base. This contrasts with tokens heavily reliant on a few large whales, which can be prone to sudden, manipulative price movements. Why are retail investors flocking to PUMP? Part of the answer lies in its current valuation. The spot price for PUMP is hovering around $0.0055, which is notably above its public sale price of $0.004. This premium, though seemingly small, means that early public sale participants are already in profit. This positive sentiment from the outset can create a virtuous cycle, attracting more investors and fostering a sense of community success. It also suggests that the initial pricing was well-calibrated, or that demand has simply outstripped initial supply, pushing the price above its launch valuation. Understanding Investor Sentiment: Spot Price: ~$0.0055 Public Sale Price: $0.004 Significance: Early investors are profitable, fostering positive sentiment and attracting new interest. The consistent positive Binance futures funding rate for PUMP further reinforces this bullish sentiment, signaling strong long interest among traders. A positive funding rate means that long position holders are paying short position holders, indicating that the majority of futures traders expect the price to rise and are willing to pay a premium to maintain their long positions. This metric is a powerful real-time indicator of market conviction and can often precede significant price movements. Decoding On-Chain Analysis: What the Data Says About PUMP For those deeply entrenched in the world of digital assets , on-chain analysis provides an unparalleled level of transparency and insight into a token’s health. The data from PUMP is particularly intriguing. Beyond the spot price and funding rates, the stability of Open Interest (OI) in PUMP contracts post-launch is a critical indicator. Open Interest represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled. A stable OI, with both long and short positions holding firm, suggests a balanced market with conviction on both sides, rather than panic selling or speculative over-leveraging. This stability is especially noteworthy given a significant market dynamic: PUMP has not yet been listed on any major centralized spot exchange. Typically, a token’s price can be highly volatile before and immediately after a major exchange listing, often experiencing a “listing pump” followed by a “dump.” PUMP’s ability to maintain a stable price without the liquidity and exposure that a top-tier exchange provides is truly unexpected. This anomaly could be attributed to the strong underlying retail support and the absence of speculative trading that often accompanies major exchange listings, allowing the token to find its organic price floor and build a more stable foundation. On-Chain Insights Table: Metric Observation Implication Binance Futures Funding Rate Remains positive Strong long interest, bullish sentiment among derivatives traders. Open Interest (OI) Stable post-launch Balanced market, conviction from both long and short positions, no panic. Major Exchange Listing None yet for spot trading Unexpected price stability, suggests strong organic demand and holding. Navigating Digital Assets: PUMP’s Path Forward The journey of any new digital asset is fraught with challenges and opportunities. For PUMP, the current stability without major exchange listings presents a unique scenario. On one hand, it demonstrates organic strength and a dedicated community. On the other, a listing on a major exchange could unlock massive liquidity, broader accessibility, and potentially significant price appreciation. The question then becomes: when, and under what circumstances, will such listings occur, and how will the market react? The pending 24% community and ecosystem airdrop also remains a key factor. A well-executed airdrop can significantly boost community engagement and decentralization, but a poorly managed one can lead to sell-offs. The team’s strategy for this allocation will be critical in maintaining the current positive momentum and further solidifying PUMP’s position in the crypto market . Actionable Insights for Investors: Monitor Liquidity Trends: Keep an eye on how total liquidity evolves, especially the proportion contributed by retail. Continued growth signals sustained interest. Watch for Airdrop Announcements: Details on the 24% community allocation will be crucial for understanding future supply dynamics and potential price impact. Anticipate Exchange Listings: While PUMP has shown stability without them, a major exchange listing could be a significant catalyst. Research potential exchanges and their listing criteria. Track Funding Rates & Open Interest: These derivatives metrics provide real-time sentiment indicators. A sustained positive funding rate and stable OI indicate continued bullish conviction. PUMP’s current trajectory offers a compelling case study in organic growth and community-driven success. Its ability to maintain price stability above its public sale price, coupled with strong retail interest and positive futures sentiment, paints a promising picture. While the absence of major spot exchange listings might seem like a hurdle, it has perhaps allowed PUMP to build a more robust, less speculative foundation. As the project moves forward, the pending airdrop and potential future exchange listings will be pivotal moments that could define its long-term success in the competitive digital asset landscape.

Another $269 million came from short-side losses, taking the total liquidation figure to $675.8 million, marking one of the heaviest wipeouts since April. The heaviest blow landed on bitcoin (BTC) longs, which saw over $333 million in forced closures, followed by ether (ETH) at $113 million and XRP at $36 million. Solana’s SOL and dogecoin (DOGE) were also hit, shedding around $14 million each. Dogecoin was the worst-performing major, dropping over 7.6% on the day as speculative froth evaporated. BTC and ETH also fell 3.1% and 2.6%, cooling off after a nearly week-long rally. The largest single liquidation came from a $98.1 million BTC/USDT long on Binance, per liquidation tracker Coinglass. Even as bitcoin trades near record highs, some desks are stepping back from the euphoria. Derivative flows suggest that traders aren’t rushing to chase the upside, and elevated funding rates are making leveraged bets increasingly expensive. The sense is that markets may be due for a breather after an overheated run. ""With BTC in uncharted territory, short-term ceilings remain unclear,"" wrote QCP Capital in a note to clients. ""Funding rates are elevated, and the memory of February’s $2 billion liquidation event still lingers."" Options data paints a picture of cautious optimism, QCP wrote. While short-dated implied volatility ticked higher, it remains well below 2023 averages. September and December risk reversals still favor call options, hinting at longer-term bullishness, though traders appear reluctant to chase upside in the near term. Meanwhile, some analysts are urging traders not to mistake momentum for inevitability. Mounting institutional demand and macro shifts are undeniably fueling the rally, but they’re also raising the stakes. “The road to $150,000 by Q3 looks increasingly plausible, powered by ETF inflows, supply constraints, and macro tailwinds like a weakening dollar and potential Fed cuts,” Bitget’s Ryan Lee said in a note to CoinDesk. “The road to $150,000 by Q3 looks increasingly plausible, powered by supply scarcity and mounting institutional demand. Still, this isn’t a one-way street. Profit-taking, rate speculation, and geopolitical risks could spark a short-term pullback, potentially dragging BTC into a $105,000–$115,000 consolidation zone,” Lee added.

The transfer coincided with a pullback in Bitcoin prices, which slipped from above $123,000 to nearly $117,600, raising fresh questions about whether big players are offloading as retail interest surges. The transaction, flagged by blockchain analytics firm Spot On Chain, is part of a broader sequence of movements from a whale that has held the coins since 2011.

Altogether, 80,000 BTC has shifted hands in recent days, marking the first activity from this wallet in over 14 years. According to Spot On Chain, eight wallets associated with the whale moved 80,000 BTC, worth around $8.68b, after over a decade of silence. Two of these wallets originally received the coins in April and May of 2011, when Bitcoin traded at less than $4. At the time, the total value of the holdings was just $217,800. Today, that stash has multiplied nearly 40,000 times in value. Galaxy Digital Receives Over $2B in BTC Transfers, With Portions Headed to Exchanges Galaxy Digital has emerged as the main destination for these funds. Lookonchain reported that 16,843 BTC, now valued at over $2b, has been transferred to the firm so far. This Bitcoin OG with 80,009 $BTC ($9.46B) transferred another 7,843 $BTC ($927M) to #GalaxyDigital , for a total of 16,843 $BTC ($2B).

As Retail Chases New Highs, Whales Are Preparing to Sell on Binance “While new all-time highs are exciting, the data points to caution. The smart money is moving, and their actions often precede significant market shifts.” – By @Crazzyblockk pic.twitter.com/bA6TX6WKWr — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) July 15, 2025 Analysts Eye Profit-Taking Signals as Dormant Wallets Stir to Life The timing has drawn attention. While retail investors keep buying, encouraged by Bitcoin’s new highs, whales seem to be shifting into profit-taking mode. As a result, some analysts see these transfers as early signs that large holders may be exiting before volatility returns. Notably, the wallet originally acquired Bitcoin at around $2 per coin. This implies a staggering return. Now, the latest movements likely mark the first sell-off by the holder since those early days. As a result, the shift may signal a major change in mindset. Conor Grogan, Coinbase’s head of product, has previously speculated that such reactivations may be due to compromised keys, though he noted the likelihood remains slim. Nevertheless, the reawakening of long-dormant coins has historically sparked caution in the market. For now, the whale still holds about 11,000 BTC, about $1.3b, leaving room for further transfers. Traders are watching closely, wary of what might come next. As more institutional desks handle whale transactions, many suspect these movements are tied to OTC deals rather than direct market sales. Even so, their effect on sentiment is hard to ignore.

Major selloffs occurred during the 14:00–15:00 and 01:00–03:00 windows, with volume spikes of 735.09M and 704.60M, crushing the 24-hour average of 415.48M. A sharp reversal began during the final session hour as DOGE rose 0.84%, from $0.1923 to $0.1939, backed by volume bursts of 22.60M and 19.06M. Institutional activity was visible on both ends of the move, pointing to tactical capital flow rather than retail-driven volatility. News Background The selloff came amid rising anxiety over delays in potential crypto ETF approvals and a sudden resurgence in U.S. enforcement chatter around centralized exchanges. At the same time, market participants began speculating about fast-tracked ETF paths for high-volume tokens like DOGE and XRP, prompting whale-led accumulation near local lows. As a result, DOGE saw rapid directional whiplash — with institutional volumes confirming exits and re-entries. Price Action Summary Range: $0.21 → $0.19 | $0.022 span = 10.44% volatility Breakdown Zones: $0.200–$0.198 during 14:00–15:00 Volume Peaks: 735.09M (14:00), 704.60M (01:00) Support Zone: $0.190–$0.191 during late-session base build Final Hour (03:37–04:36): Price rose from $0.1923 → $0.1939 (+0.84%) Recovery Volume: 22.60M at 04:10, 19.06M at 04:09 during breakout push Technical Analysis Breakdown confirmed by lower-high, lower-low sequence into $0.19 session low Selling intensified as $0.200–$0.201 failed to hold during evening session Final-hour breakout above $0.1930 confirms localized reversal setup Key resistance: $0.1960–$0.1980 for short-term continuation Risk remains elevated if DOGE fails to reclaim $0.200 on sustained volume What Traders Are Watching Can DOGE reclaim the $0.198–$0.200 zone to restore trend structure? Rejection from $0.196 would likely confirm another leg down toward $0.188 Watch for follow-through volume above 400M to confirm trend shift Institutional wallet activity and futures OI positioning remain critical Takeaway DOGE’s 10% plunge was sudden but it wasn’t retail chaos. High-volume breakdowns and targeted re-entries show that institutions are playing both sides. While the bounce offers short-term relief, the macro structure remains vulnerable. Bulls must reclaim $0.200 fast — or risk deeper downside.

This substantial capital injection is earmarked for a unique dual strategy: acquiring both Bitcoin investment and gold. This decision signals a growing confidence in a diversified approach that bridges the traditional with the revolutionary, offering a fascinating glimpse into the future of asset allocation. A Bold Move: Understanding the Bitcoin Investment Strategy The allocation of a significant portion of newly raised funds towards Bitcoin underscores a profound shift in institutional perception. Once dismissed as a speculative digital novelty, Bitcoin has steadily matured into a recognized asset class, often dubbed ‘digital gold.’ Its decentralized nature, finite supply, and increasing adoption as a store of value have made it an attractive hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Growing Institutional Interest: More investment firms are adding Bitcoin to their portfolios, recognizing its potential for significant returns and its role in a diversified asset mix. Inflationary Hedge: With global economies facing inflationary pressures, Bitcoin’s capped supply makes it an appealing counter-asset. Digital Scarcity: Its inherent scarcity, similar to precious metals, provides a strong value proposition in the digital age. Digital Commodities’ move is not just about chasing returns; it’s a strategic positioning to capitalize on the ongoing digital transformation of finance. Their commitment to Bitcoin investment reflects a forward-thinking approach to managing capital in an increasingly digital world. The Timeless Appeal: Reassessing Gold Investment in the Modern Era While Bitcoin represents the new frontier, gold remains a cornerstone of traditional portfolios. Its inclusion in Digital Commodities’ strategy alongside Bitcoin is a testament to its enduring value and its role as a stable asset during turbulent times. Gold has historically served as a reliable safe haven, preserving wealth across generations and acting as a hedge against currency debasement and geopolitical risks. Why combine the oldest form of money with the newest? Diversification: Gold often has a low correlation with other asset classes, providing stability when markets are volatile. Proven Track Record: Centuries of history demonstrate gold’s ability to retain value during economic downturns. Tangible Asset: For many investors, the physical nature of gold offers a sense of security that digital assets cannot replicate. This balanced approach recognizes that while Bitcoin offers exciting growth potential, gold investment provides a time-tested anchor, creating a robust and resilient portfolio. Behind the Scenes: How Digital Commodities Funding Shapes Future Portfolios The $2 million raised by Digital Commodities is more than just capital; it’s a vote of confidence from investors who believe in the firm’s vision of a blended asset strategy. This funding allows Digital Commodities to execute its dual acquisition plan, building a portfolio that aims to capture growth from digital assets while maintaining stability through traditional commodities. The successful Digital Commodities funding round indicates a growing appetite among sophisticated investors for innovative strategies that look beyond conventional investment vehicles. It suggests that financial institutions are increasingly willing to explore and integrate digital assets into their core offerings, recognizing the demand from a new generation of investors seeking exposure to both established and emerging markets. The Best of Both Worlds? Exploring the Crypto Gold Hybrid Model The decision to invest in both Bitcoin and gold positions Digital Commodities at the forefront of a burgeoning trend: the crypto gold hybrid portfolio. This strategy aims to leverage the unique strengths of each asset class to create a more resilient and diversified investment vehicle. While Bitcoin offers exposure to rapid technological advancement and potential exponential growth, gold provides a stable, tangible hedge against various economic uncertainties. Benefits of a Crypto-Gold Hybrid: Enhanced Diversification: Mitigates risks by spreading investments across assets with different risk profiles and market drivers. Dual Hedging: Offers protection against both traditional inflation (gold) and potential fiat currency devaluation (Bitcoin). Broader Market Exposure: Captures value from both the traditional commodity markets and the rapidly expanding digital asset ecosystem. Challenges to Consider: Bitcoin Volatility: While maturing, Bitcoin can still experience significant price swings. Custody and Security: Ensuring the safe storage of both physical gold and digital Bitcoin requires specialized solutions. Regulatory Landscape: The crypto space is still evolving, posing regulatory uncertainties that do not apply to gold. Here’s a comparative look at these two powerful assets: Feature Bitcoin Gold Nature Digital, Decentralized Physical, Centralized Mining Supply Fixed (21 million) Finite, but variable mining Volatility High Moderate to Low Store of Value Emerging ‘Digital Gold’ Traditional ‘Safe Haven’ Accessibility Global, 24/7 Digital Market hours, physical transfer Beyond Tradition: The Expanding Landscape of Alternative Investments Digital Commodities’ strategy is part of a larger narrative where investors are increasingly looking beyond conventional stocks and bonds for growth and stability. The search for alternative investments has gained momentum as traditional markets face unprecedented challenges, including low interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical instability. This has led to a surge of interest in assets like cryptocurrencies, real estate, private equity, and even collectibles. For individual investors, this trend offers a crucial lesson: diversification is key. While not every investor can access specialized funds, understanding the principles behind a crypto-gold hybrid can inform personal portfolio decisions. Consider allocating a portion of your portfolio to assets that are less correlated with traditional markets, whether it’s through direct crypto exposure, gold ETFs, or other alternative assets that align with your risk tolerance. Conclusion: A New Dawn for Diversification Digital Commodities’ $2 million fundraising and its commitment to purchasing Bitcoin and gold mark a pivotal moment in the investment world. It underscores a growing recognition that future-proof portfolios will likely be those that strategically blend the proven stability of traditional assets with the innovative potential of digital currencies. This move is a powerful signal to the market, highlighting the evolving definition of value and the necessity of adapting investment strategies to a dynamic global economy. As the lines between traditional and digital finance continue to blur, firms like Digital Commodities are paving the way for a new era of diversified and resilient wealth management.

Traded under the tickers XRPQ and XRPQ.U on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the fund has become the largest XRP-focused ETF in Canada. The fund launched on June 18 and quickly positioned itself as a competitive offering in the Canadian market. The rapid inflow of assets highlights an important trend, which is the growing demand for regulated exposure to XRP among both institutional and retail investors. The Mass Appeal for XRP ETFs in Canada In its official post on X, 3iQ highlighted comments from Pascal St-Jean, President and CEO of the company, who pointed to the ETF’s structure as a key factor in its strong early performance. He said the achievement “shows the continuing strong interest in these assets” and reflects how investors are making more selective choices when allocating capital. Its standout feature, a 0% management fee for the first six months, has also been central to its early success. The ETF is also eligible for tax-advantaged accounts in Canada, including TFSA and RRSP, broadening its appeal to a wider segment of investors. By combining the transparency and accessibility of an exchange-traded fund with zero management fees at launch, this ETF differentiates itself from earlier digital asset products that often came with high costs and limited liquidity. We are proud to announce that our XRP ETF (TSX: XRPQ, XRPQ.U), Canada’s largest #XRP ETF, has accumulated over 50 million USD in client assets since its launch on June 18th. “This significant milestone for our XRP ETF shows the continuing strong interest in these assets and… pic.twitter.com/rpi3BmwE3W — 3iQ Digital Asset Management (@3iq_corp) July 14, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Race for a U.S.-Based XRP ETF The launch of XRPQ comes at a time when market participants are increasingly looking at blockchain-based assets not just for speculative gains, but also for portfolio diversification. Recent activity in the U.S. suggests a heated regulatory race to launch XRP-related exchange‑traded products. Asset managers, including ProShares, Franklin Templeton , Grayscale, and more, have filed with the SEC to introduce spot XRP ETFs, with several key deadlines approaching. Grayscale has also made notable strides in its attempt to convert its Digital Large Cap Fund, which includes XRP, into a spot ETF. While the SEC recently halted the process, Grayscale has revealed that it is working with key stakeholders to meet the SEC’s requirements and launch the product . While the U.S. lacks a dedicated spot XRP ETF, Canada has taken a leadership position, and the interest shown in 3iQ’s offering proves that investors are willing to engage with spot XRP ETFs. The strong debut of XRPQ could influence how future digital asset ETFs are structured, and may also affect future regulation that makes ETF launches easier.

In a market starving for explosive growth, two tokens trading under $0.10—Little Pepe (LILPEPE) and Cronos (CRO)—are now leading a new wave. And with the right timing, a $450 play on these tokens could balloon into $15,000 in just 15 weeks. Here’s why. LILPEPE: The Meme-Tech Rocket with 95x Potential Little Pepe is no ordinary meme coin—it’s the heart of a new Ethereum Layer-2 network focused on speed, scalability, and meme culture utility. LILPEPE is building its launchpad, tax-free ecosystem, sniper bot protection, and more. Its presale is currently in Stage 5 at $0.0014, and over 73.76% of the 5.25 billion tokens allocated have been sold, raising $4.64 million in the process. Once Stage 5 fills up, the price will increase to $0.0015, with the public launch listing set at $0.003—already offering buyers a guaranteed 114.28% gain at launch. But that’s just the beginning. Post-launch projections point toward a potential ATH of $0.134, which would represent a 9,487% surge—or nearly 95x your initial investment. That means $300 in LILPEPE today could realistically grow into $28,500 within the next few months. Add that to a meme coin ecosystem giving away $770,000 worth of tokens to ten lucky winners ($77K each), and you’ve got FOMO written all over it. Even industry insiders are noticing the momentum, with prominent mentions in publications like AInvest and GlobeNewswire , both of which highlight whale movements and heavy retail participation. Investors who jumped in at $0.0010 are already up over 40%. CRO: The ETF-Backed Utility Sleeper Cronos (CRO), the native token of the Crypto.com blockchain, has been in accumulation mode, but that silence has just been broken. Following a 20% daily price surge, CRO is back on the radar, thanks to the hype surrounding its potential inclusion in a new “blue-chip” crypto ETF reportedly backed by Truth Social. This narrative helped CRO climb from $0.08 to $0.09 within hours, as reported by Coinpedia and Crypto. News . The token’s technical indicators are also intense—MACD flips, RSI momentum, and heavy whale inflows suggest a breakout to $0.11 or even $0.13 is within reach. On the fundamentals side, CRO powers an ecosystem of over 80 million users across the Crypto.com app, DeFi, and NFTs. According to a recent forecast by Cryptopolitan , CRO could average $0.0963–$0.1076 in the near term, with some price models suggesting upside to $0.26 in a bullish environment. On Reddit , users are even speculating that a run to $1 is a long-term possibility. So if you allocate $150 to CRO and it doubles or triples, you’re looking at a return of $300–$450, safely balancing the rocket-like trajectory of LILPEPE with something grounded. Why Dogecoin Can’t Keep Up At around $0.30, Dogecoin has already lost most of its speculative punch. Even if it doubles or triples, you’re still looking at gains capped at 2x to 3x, and that’s assuming Elon Musk tweets something exciting. In contrast, both LILPEPE and CRO have serious catalysts brewing. LILPEPE is driving community virality, whale accumulation, and Layer 2 development simultaneously. CRO is benefiting from rising institutional exposure, strong fundamentals, and surging user adoption. That combination—speed and strength—makes a $450 portfolio (split between $300 in LILPEPE and $150 in CRO) a seriously compelling bet. How $450 Becomes $15,000 If LILPEPE surges to $0.134 post-launch as projected, $300 becomes $28,500. If CRO doubles or triples from its current position, $150 becomes $300–$450. Together, you’re looking at a real possibility of turning $450 into $15,000 or more. And best of all? The timeline is short. With presale Stage 5 nearly 74% filled, the window is rapidly closing. LILPEPE’s listing is right around the corner, and CRO’s chart is heating up. Conclusion: Choose Momentum, Not Memory Dogecoin had its run. But nostalgia doesn’t generate returns—strategy does. Currently, that strategy points to LILPEPE and CRO. One delivers the hype and heat, the other the utility and adoption. The blend is perfect. If you’ve been sitting on the sidelines, wondering when the next big move will come, this is it. Don’t watch it happen. Position yourself before the fireworks begin.

The bloc has targeted $84 billion worth of U.S. goods, including automobiles, Boeing aircraft, and bourbon, amid heightened global trade tensions. A 206-page list issued by the European Commission on Monday showed that the bloc’s finalized countermeasures are also directed towards machinery products, plastics, chemicals, electrical equipment, medical devices, agricultural goods, and wine. According to the list, the EU didn’t include tariff rates for the goods.

The U.S. imposed reciprocal levies on most EU goods and added 25% tariffs on automobiles and auto parts. The U.S. later settled on a baseline 10% rate to allow for trade negotiations with nations globally. Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke also mentioned at a news conference in Brussels on Monday that Trump’s tariff threat was unacceptable. The bloc accused the U.S. of being reluctant to settle for trade negotiations and warned it of issuing countermeasures if no deal is reached by August 1. The U.S. President warned over the weekend he would raise the bloc’s levies to 30% if there are no trade deals before the deadline on August 1. Trump acknowledged that he is open to further discussions with the bloc and other trading partners. “They would like to do a different kind of a deal and we’re always open to talk, including Europe. In fact, they’re coming over. They’d like to talk.” -Donald Trump, U.S President. The European Union initially issued the list targeting U.S. goods worth 95 billion euros, but it was minimized after dialogue with countries and firms within the bloc. The EU also requires its 27 nations to give their approval before the adoption of the list. The 27-nation bloc had previously issued countermeasures of 21 billion euros on U.S. imports but later extended it to counter Trump’s additional tariffs on steel and aluminum. Italy’s Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani revealed over the weekend that the EU was ready with roughly $24.5B worth of countermeasures against U.S. goods if both parties failed to reach a deal. The EU also plans to tariff over 65 billion euros of industrial goods, including 11 billion euros on aircraft, approximately 9.4 billion euros on machinery, and roughly 8 billion euros on cars. The EU also targeted 6 billion euros on agricultural products, including 2 billion euros on fruits and vegetables and around 1.2 billion euros on alcoholic beverages. The 27-nation bloc also issued 500 million euros on toys and hobby equipment, 200 million euros on musical instruments, and more than 300 million euros on sports guns.

He believes there is still a chance for continued negotiations, but argued that the bloc is yet to settle on a good deal with its largest trading partner. Sefcovic revealed on Monday that there are more plans to meet with the Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum mentioned that she is hopeful for a trade deal on security with the U.S. Trump has accused the country of not making more effort towards combating fentanyl flow into the U.S., adding that the 30% tariff on Mexico would not apply to goods shipped under the USMCA trade agreement. She also maintained that no deal will include the U.S. forces entering Mexican borders, as mentioned by Trump. South Korea officials stated Monday that Trump’s deadline made it impossible to reach a deal and offered to expand access of its agricultural market to the U.S. Seoul’s Minister for Trade Yeo Han-Koo also acknowledged that the country was cautious to avoid heightened U.S. levies on major industries that would undermine the economic relationship with its main trading partner.

Investors remained focused on ongoing trade talks, while also anticipating key U.S. inflation data and a wave of bank earnings later in the week. On the geopolitical front, US President Donald Trump reiterated openness to renewed tariff negotiations with the European Union and other key trading partners. Geopolitical tensions added to the uncertainty after President Trump threatened to impose secondary tariffs of 100% on Russia unless a peace agreement with Ukraine is reached within 50 days. Gold prices rose to around $3,360 per ounce on Tuesday, as concerns over the impact of US President Donald Trump's tariff war enhanced the metal’s safe-haven appeal. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.24% to below 39,430 while the broader Topix Index rose 0.5% to 2,837 on Tuesday, with Japanese shares showing mixed performances. The Japanese yen hovered around 147.6 per dollar on Tuesday, near its lowest level in two months, as persistent trade-related tensions weighed on sentiment. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.65% slipping 0.2% to around 3,510 while the Shenzhen Component rose 0.4% to 10,730, as investors digested a raft of economic data that painted a mixed picture of the recovery, and the offshore yuan steady to around 7.17 per dollar on Tuesday, pausing gains for the second consecutive session. China’s economy expanded 5.2% yoy in Q2 2025 , slowing from 5.4% in the prior two quarters and marking the slowest pace since Q3 2024. China's industrial production rebounded strongly in June 2025, with a 6.8% year-on-year increase, marks a significant acceleration from May's 5.8%. China's retail sales increased by 4.8% year-on-year in June 2025, slowing from over one-year high of 6.4% and missing market expectations of a 5.6% gain. China’s fixed-asset investment rose by 2.8% year-on-year in the first half of 2025, coming in below market forecasts of a 3.7% growth. China’s surveyed unemployment rate stood at 5.0% in June 2025, unchanged from the previous month and in line with market expectations. China’s industrial capacity utilization rate decreased to 74 percent in the second quarter of 2025 from 74.9 percent in the same period a year earlier, marking the lowest rate since the first quarter of 2020. China’s new home prices in 70 cities declined by 3.2% year-on-year in June 2025, slowing from a 3.5% drop in the previous month. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 0.36% to 24,244 around midday Tuesday, snapping a three-session winning streak. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.24% to 82,390 in early trade on Tuesday, snapping a four-session losing streak. The index attempted to rebound from its three-week low touched the previous day, supported by hopes of a potential US-India trade deal. Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said on Monday that negotiations with the US are expected to result in a ""win-win"" trade-complementing agreement. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.59% to 8,623 on Tuesday, rebounding from a modest decline in the prior session and reaching its highest level in over a month. The Australian dollar edged higher to around $0.654 on Tuesday, following a notable decline in the previous session. Domestically, sentiment was further buoyed by positive economic data, with the Westpac-Melbourne Institute Consumer Sentiment Index rising by 0.6% month-on-month to 93.1 in July 2025, following a 0.5% uptick in June. Investors are now turning their attention to key domestic data releases later this week, including consumer inflation expectations and the latest employment figures. In the U.S., on Thursday, all three major indexes ended slightly higher as investors weighed renewed tariff threats from President Trump against optimism over upcoming earnings and inflation data. President Donald Trump urged the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates to 1%, arguing it would reduce federal borrowing costs and boost economic growth. “We need a 1% rate. The Fed is killing growth,” he said on Monday. Investors now await the US CPI report, due later today, for more clues into the Fed's rate path. U.S. stock futures slightly higher on Tuesday as investors turned cautious ahead of major bank earnings and a closely watched inflation report: Dow +0.08% ; S&P 500 +0.30% ; Nasdaq +0.49% .

Users need BNB and Alpha Points to join events; buy orders remain locked until event ends. Binance enters the bonding curve race as meme coin platforms like LetsBONK surpass Pump.fun in activity. New Token Event Model Debuts on Binance Wallet Binance has introduced a new pricing model for token generation events (TGEs) through its Wallet. The system follows a bonding curve structure, where token prices move higher as more users buy during the event window. Meanwhile, this approach mirrors the mechanism used by Pump.fun and was developed in partnership with meme coin launchpad Four.Meme. Binance confirmed that this is the first time it has offered such a model. The first project using this setup will be announced on July 15 via the Binance Wallet X account. We’re redefining token launches with the introduction of the Exclusive Bonding Curve-Based Token Generation Event (TGE) on Binance Wallet, in collaboration with https://t.co/a6yKhb5iK9 . The first project to use this Bonding Curve TGE model will be revealed tomorrow. Know more… pic.twitter.com/uQ36m0Vwsb — Binance (@binance) July 14, 2025 Live Pricing and Locked Orders During Events The new format allows users to buy and trade non-transferable tokens with BNB while the event is live. Prices rise automatically based on real-time demand. Once the event ends, the tokens can be transferred and traded on Binance Alpha. Users will not be able to cancel orders once they are placed. BNB used for purchases stays locked until the event closes. Binance described the structure as one that offers a more open way to determine token value before a full market listing. To take part, users need a balance of Binance Alpha Points along with BNB in their Wallet. Alpha Points are part of Binance’s internal system used to score eligibility based on platform activity. The goal is to make access more consistent for active users while limiting automated trades during the token event. Binance said the system is designed to give users a clearer way to join early-stage token sales. Memecoin Launchpads and User Risks The update comes as competition grows between meme coin platforms. LetsBONK has recently passed Pump.fun in token launches and trading volume on Solana. User caution remains a topic across platforms. Analytics firm Lookonchain reported a case where a user lost $75,000 in PUMP tokens.

At the same time, BlockDAG (BDAG) is taking a smarter path. It’s made for those who want more access upfront, not delays. With $338 M raised, 2 million+ X1 miner users, and a clear plan already rolling, BlockDAG is focused on action, not hype. BTC Bull Rockets 82% In One Day BTC Bull’s price jumped 82% in a single day, grabbing attention and reigniting interest from meme coin enthusiasts. The coin now trades around $0.0055. Traders are circling, driven by renewed volume and social media chatter. Bold BTC Bull price predictions are emerging by the hour. However, underneath the buzz, the project lacks structure. Like most meme coins, it’s fueled by community sentiment and market timing. There’s no clear plan, no unique function, just rapid spikes that thrill short-term buyers but worry long-term holders. That doesn’t make BTC Bull a bad play, it just carries risk. If momentum holds, it could climb further. If not, it may fade as another flash in the meme coin game. For now, it’s loud, fast, and full of hype. BlockDAG’s $338M Presale Confirms Growing Demand and Early Strength BlockDAG is taking a more tactical route. With the BEAT VESTING PASS, buyers can unlock 80% of their coins at launch instead of the usual 40%. That offers much greater flexibility and freedom for early participants. BlockDAG has raised $338 million through its presale and is entering Batch 29, priced at $0.0276 per coin. So far, 23.8 billion coins have been sold. People who bought in Batch 1 are seeing a staggering 2,660% gain compared to the original Batch 29 price. The launch price is set at $0.05. As part of the GLOBAL LAUNCH release, the current purchase price is $0.0016 until August 11, one of the lowest price. If users buy now, they could see a 3,025% return based on the $0.05 launch price. The BEAT VESTING PASS applies only to non‑bonus coins: 80% of non‑bonus coins are unlocked at launch. Bonus coins are excluded from this early release. This isn’t just a marketing gimmick, it’s a clear strategy to give participants control from day one. No long lockups, no slow schedules. Buyers know exactly what they’re getting and when they’ll get it. Supported by $338 M raised, momentum from 2 million+ X1 miner app users, and a roadmap already in motion, BlockDAG is prioritizing delivery over hype. In a market where timing and clarity matter, the BEAT VESTING PASS offers real structure and a strong foundation. Long-Term Growth Favors BlockDAG Over Bull BTC Bull is enjoying a moment in the spotlight. With a fast price rise and meme-level attention online, it’s grabbing short-term interest. But these trends often come and go. BTC Bull still lacks a roadmap, defined purpose, or a real use case that could hold value long-term. It’s riding hype, but that alone isn’t enough to sustain real momentum once excitement fades. In contrast, BlockDAG offers a more grounded approach. With its BEAT VESTING PASS, early participants get to unlock 80% of non-bonus coins at launch, giving them more control right from the start. It’s a presale with structure, not just noise. Backed by $338 M raised, strong community traction, and over 2 million X1 miner app users, BlockDAG is built for those looking beyond the hype toward steady, long-term potential. Conclusion BTC Bull is creating buzz, thanks to its sharp 82% price spike and viral chatter. But buzz fades fast if it isn’t backed by something solid. For BTC Bull to maintain attention, it needs more than social media excitement. It needs real features, community trust, and a clear reason for people to stay. Without those, it may just become another meme coin that shined briefly before fading out. BlockDAG, however, is offering more than just talk. Its BEAT VESTING PASS gives early participants 80% of their non-bonus coins unlocked at launch, providing more freedom and movement from day one. Add to that a $338 M presale raise, growing app users, and a transparent roadmap, it shows strong planning. While meme coins chase hype, BlockDAG focuses on real delivery and long-term value from launch day onward.

The bank also predicts an “upside scenario” for Bitcoin of $155,000 by December 2025. In a research report released today, TD Cowen attributed its optimism for Strategy stock to the company's massive Bitcoin portfolio and potential price increases. The company recently purchased an additional 4,225 BTC for $472.5 million, bringing its total BTC holdings to 601,550. The average unit cost for these purchases was $111,827. Related News: Another Country Announces Plan to Create Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Fund TD Cowen believes the company's aggressive BTC accumulation plans could yield significant long-term returns. The report stated, “This strategy, initially launched to protect the value of reserve assets, has now evolved into an opportunistic approach aimed at increasing shareholder value.” The firm's baseline scenario is for Bitcoin to reach around $128,000 in December. A potential “downside” scenario sees the price at $55,000. Today, BTC broke a new record, surpassing $120,000 for the first time in history. The strategy aims to raise a total of $84 billion through debt and equity for future Bitcoin acquisitions under its “42/42 plan.” TD Cowen predicts that this strategy could generate approximately 900,000 BTC for the company by the end of 2027. *This is not investment advice.

With July bringing fresh volatility and major headlines across crypto, the race for early access is on. The best part? These top cryptos to join in 2025 aren’t just riding old trends. They’re shaping the narrative, drawing in a new wave of investors, and igniting serious buzz on crypto forums and social channels. As the market preps for the next bull run, it’s not just about catching up, it’s about getting ahead. Here’s a close look at four top cryptos to join in 2025 that are making waves right now, including one meme coin whose exclusive whitelist is sparking a rush for early spots. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU): Unstoppable Bull Energy and Early Access Hype MoonBull isn’t just another Ethereum meme coin. It’s built for those chasing major upside, with a structure designed for high-octane community energy. What’s turning heads? MoonBull’s whitelist is live, but only for a limited time, and those who get in now are the ones unlocking all the benefits.

Whitelisted users will secure the lowest entry price, private roadmap hints, bonus token drops, and even exclusive staking rewards. No details go public before launch, making MoonBull a true insiders’ club for meme coin degens and crypto risk-takers looking for the top cryptos to join in 2025. Why MoonBull Keeps Making the List of Top Cryptos to Join in 2025 The combination of hype, exclusive perks, and true scarcity is building moon bull’s reputation as the go-to project for high-energy traders this summer. MoonBull’s blend of early access, bonus rewards, and real community-driven energy makes it one of the top cryptos to join in 2025 before the rest of the market catches up. To get a spot, simply submit an email through the secure whitelist form. Those who make the list will get a direct notification ahead of launch, putting them one step ahead of the crowd. Supply is limited. As more traders start eyeing this launch, bulls are on the move. Missing this window could mean missing the next big story of the meme coin market. 2. Pepe (PEPE): The Deflationary Meme Coin That Won’t Quit Pepe exploded onto the Ethereum scene as a tribute to the internet’s legendary frog meme. Its simple, pure memecoin status, no tax, no hidden agenda, keeps the appeal honest and raw. Pepe has become a staple in meme coin circles, drawing in degens and crypto enthusiasts looking for that perfect blend of nostalgia and viral potential. What keeps Pepe in the headlines? Its deflationary model means the supply drops over time, creating constant buying pressure. Community support, combined with relentless meme power, has allowed PEPE to carve out its own lane. In July, the chatter around top cryptos to join in 2025 includes Pepe not for utility or tech, but because it thrives on buzz and market momentum. Why did this coin make it to this list? Pepe’s relentless energy and status as a pure, crowd-driven meme coin prove that, in the right market, simplicity and meme magic are enough to keep a project trending and growing. 3. Bonk (BONK): The People’s Dog Coin on Solana Launched on the Solana blockchain, Bonk stands out as the first dog-themed coin that put the power directly into the hands of its community. With half of its total supply airdropped to Solana users, Bonk is all about fair access and breaking the mold of “toxic” tokenomics. This transparency and inclusivity are exactly what’s helping Bonk trend as one of the top cryptos to join in 2025. Bonk’s popularity has been growing with the Solana ecosystem. Community engagement is at the heart of every move, from airdrops to ongoing upgrades. As more traders look beyond Ethereum for the next wave of meme coin potential, Bonk’s accessibility and strong narrative are pushing it onto must-watch lists everywhere. Why did this coin make it to this list? Bonk is proof that community-first models can capture serious market attention and hold it, especially when fair launches and viral stories align. 4. Dogwifhat (WIF): Solana’s Viral Sensation Is Gaining Steam Dogwifhat has become a household name for Solana meme coin fans. Launched in late 2023, this Shiba Inu coin, complete with its signature knitted hat, quickly captured the hearts (and wallets) of meme traders everywhere. Built on Solana, Dogwifhat combines fast, low-fee transactions with a pop-culture-friendly mascot. Dogwifhat’s rise is fueled by organic social hype and a strong “viral” energy, making it a favorite among younger traders. Its position as one of the top cryptos to join in 2025 comes from both its community loyalty and its creative approach to branding. Why did this coin make it to this list? Dogwifhat is living proof that when a meme coin combines strong branding, rapid adoption, and passionate holders, it can jump from newcomer to headline maker in record time. The Bottom Line Based on the latest research, the top cryptos to join in 2025 are MoonBull, Pepe, Dogwifhat and Bonk.

The asset is currently trading at $2.87, marking a 26% increase from the previous week. Over the last 24 hours, XRP has tested the $3 level multiple times, fueling renewed speculation about its immediate future. Amid this volatility, crypto expert Edoardo Farina shared a bold projection, stating, “XRP could make a new all-time high within 48h.” $XRP COULD MAKE A NEW ALL TIME HIGH WITHIN 48H — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) July 14, 2025 Farina’s prediction arrives at a pivotal moment for XRP, as it continues its sustained rally amid a broader crypto resurgence. XRP reached its all-time high of $3.84 in January 2018, and the closest it has come since then was January 2025 when it hit $3.35. However, Farina is confident that it will surpass $3.84 over the next 48 hours. The asset’s recent strength follows a series of technical confirmations , and Farina’s prediction adds urgency to the outlook, implying that a major milestone may be closer than many anticipated. Community Excitement for XRP Reactions from the XRP community show optimism and confidence that Farina’s prediction will come true. One commenter emphasized how fast the market environment is evolving, and rapid shifts in sentiment could lead to significant outcomes in a short time frame. This aligns with XRP’s historical tendency to move quickly once key resistance levels are broken. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Other responses also expressed hope that Farina’s projection will materialize soon. Some welcomed the forecast but remained reserved, signaling a wait-and-see approach. Others offered direct affirmations of the token’s future, confidently stating that XRP could climb even higher. Will XRP Surpass $3.84? Supporters also pointed to fundamental drivers backing the price movement. One user cited the combination of regulatory clarity, global partnerships, and real-world utility as reasons he has maintained a strong conviction in XRP over the years. The same user suggested that what lies ahead may serve as validation for that stance, should Farina’s prediction materialize. A well-known crypto millionaire recently highlighted $3 as the neckline for a cup-and-handle pattern that could push XRP to $5.2 once the breakout is confirmed. As XRP approaches the $3 threshold, all eyes are on whether it can sustain momentum and surpass its previous high. Farina has consistently advised against selling XRP early , and the next two days could prove to be defining ones for the digital asset and those who took his advice to hold their tokens.

Key Takeaways: Bit Digital plans to raise $67.3 million through a direct share offering to buy more Ethereum. The company recently converted its entire Bitcoin holdings to Ether. Bit Digital’s move aligns with growing institutional interest in Ethereum amid a rising crypto market. The proceeds will be used exclusively to purchase Ethereum, further expanding the company’s growing ETH treasury, the firm said in a Monday announcement . Priced at $3.06 per share, the offering is managed by B. Riley Securities and is expected to close around July 15. Bit Digital Converts Entire Bitcoin Holdings to Ethereum The move follows Bit Digital’s recent decision to convert its entire Bitcoin holdings into Ether , reflecting a strategic pivot toward Ethereum. As of early July, the firm held roughly 100,603 ETH, valued at approximately $301 million. Bit Digital offers a range of services including validator operations, enterprise custody, and yield optimization. It began building its Ethereum stake and engaging in staking activities in 2022, signaling a long-term commitment to the Ethereum ecosystem. In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Bit Digital disclosed its preliminary estimated revenue for the second quarter to be between $24.3 million and $26.9 million. Despite a slight dip in its stock price by 1.2% to close at $3.29 on Monday, shares have risen more than 32% over the last month. Ethereum’s price has also gained momentum, rising 0.6% to $2,991 and climbing over 18% in the past week amid a broad crypto market rally. Meanwhile, Bitcoin remained relatively flat, dipping slightly to $118,852. Bit Digital’s latest capital raise and strategic shift toward Ethereum comes amid growing institutional interest in the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. Bit Digital CEO: ""This is why we switched from Bitcoin mining to a 100% Ethereum treasury strategy…"" pic.twitter.com/dz7HB6Ldf6 — Traders Paradise (@theparadiselive) July 15, 2025 On Monday, SharpLink Gaming increased its Ethereum holdings with a fresh acquisition valued at nearly $49 million. As reported, the company received 16,374 ETH on Sunday afternoon, sourced from a wallet that had recently purchased the tokens from Galaxy Digital’s over-the-counter market. Last week, Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin said the company has been purchasing tens of millions of dollars worth of ETH every day. “We are accumulating more and more consistently — we’re able to acquire tens of millions of dollars in Ether a day,” Lubin told CNBC. More Public Companies Diversify into Crypto Following the model pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, more public companies are diversifying into crypto holdings that include BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP. Just recently, BIT Mining announced plans to raise between $200 million and $300 million to build a Solana (SOL) treasury as part of a broader expansion into the fast-growing blockchain ecosystem. Last week, DeFi Development Corp. revealed that it has acquired $2.7 million worth of Solana as part of its aggressive crypto treasury strategy. Likewise, Canadian digital asset firm Sol Strategies, already trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange, holds over 420,000 SOL tokens, positioning itself as a significant institutional player in Solana’s ecosystem. Last month, the firm also filed to list its common shares on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker “STKE” as it ramps up its U.S. expansion.

President Trump is demanding big rate cuts and even talking about replacing him. At the same time, the Fed is facing heat over a $2.5 billion renovation project, though it’s not using taxpayer money. Meanwhile, financial analyst Paul Barron says all this could turn out to be bullish news for crypto, especially Bitcoin. CPI Data Expectations The tension is set to peak as new Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data will be released today for June. However, last month, May’s CPI came in at 2.4%, slightly higher than April’s figure. Now, experts predict June’s CPI might rise to 2.6% . However, if inflation surprises to the downside, falling below 2.4%, it could give the Federal Reserve the green light to cut interest rates sooner. Lower interest rates would likely pump more liquidity into the markets, giving a strong boost to risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Recently, Bitcoin just broke the $120,000 mark, reaching as high as $123,000 . Analysts’ optimistic forecasts suggest Bitcoin could reach $130,000 before the end of July. Powell’s $2.5 Billion Renovation Scandal Intensifies On top of it Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is dealing with mounting controversy as the cost of renovating the Fed’s historic Washington D.C. headquarters has soared to $2.5 billion , nearly $700 million above earlier expectations. Crypto Week: Big Decisions Ahead It’s not just the CPI data release or the Fed drama giving crypto a boost. This week, the U.S. House of Representatives is calling it “Crypto Week” as lawmakers vote on key crypto bills. One of them is the CLARITY Act, which aims to set clear rules for digital assets and cryptocurrency markets and decide which agencies will regulate it. Another is the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which wants to block the launch of a government digital dollar due to privacy concerns. The GENIUS Act is also on the table. It sets the first clear rules for stablecoins, helping both safety and innovation. Why This Matters for Crypto According to analyst Paul Barron, the stakes are huge. If tomorrow’s CPI numbers come in below 2.4%, the Fed might cut interest rates soon. That could bring fresh money into the market and push risk assets like crypto higher.

Uniswap price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market trends, as the coin’s price is correcting after a continued bullish impulse observed over the past week, which is a natural phenomenon. If sellers hold the ongoing momentum, UNI’s price might correct to the $8.3 range. On the other hand, if buyers take interest, the coin might make further gains. In such a case, UNI’s price might recover above immediate resistance channels and head toward the $9 range. Is Uniswap a good investment? Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with massive potential. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $26.83 level by 2027 and above $52.95 by 2031. Why is UNI down? The broader crypto market is experiencing a bearish phase today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are shedding value, and so is UNI. As sellers gained ground around $9.2, negative sentiment returned to the market. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2025? The maximum UNI can reach in 2025 is $12.71, while the average price is expected to be around $10.59. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading just above the $7 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $7.5 and $8.6; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2027. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high and not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it’s worth waiting, as the coin’s value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI’s price to reach $55.07 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price.

According to EMJ Capital founder Eric Jackson, ETH could hit $10,000 by the end of the current cycle, fueled not just by exchange-traded funds (ETFs) but by the anticipated greenlighting of staking within those products. The Staking Catalyst In a series of posts on X on July 13, Jackson argued that while the market believes the impact of the spot Ethereum ETF is “already priced in,” the true game-changer lies in the pending staking approval. The analyst believes this transformation would trigger significant passive capital inflows from traditional finance (tradfi), provide institutions with a “real yield” going as high as 3.5%, and dramatically increase demand to stake ETH. The resulting decrease in circulating supply would compound the cryptocurrency’s existing deflationary tokenomics, where the net ETH supply is shrinking post-Merge, creating a potential “structural supply crunch” and a revaluation of Ethereum’s status: “Our analysis suggests the ETH network is underpriced. It generates real revenue,” the hedge fund manager noted. He further stressed that once staking approval comes in, the asset will cease to be just “digital oil,” but will instead become an “institutional-grade yield product.” In such a scenario, he estimates ETH will reach $10,000 by the end of the current cycle and possibly even go past $15,000. “Our base case? ETH hits $10K by end of this cycle,” he wrote.”Our bull case? $15K+ if L2 adoption and ETF inflows beat expectations on the new staking approval expected before October.” Not Everyone Is a Believer As expected, Jackson’s bold prediction faced immediate pushback and necessary corrections. One X commentator pointed out Ethereum wouldn’t be the first U.S.-listed staking crypto ETF. That honor goes to the REX-Osprey Solana (SOL) ETF, launched on the Cboe on July 2. Offering about a 7.3% yield, the product is reported to have attracted $33 million in trading volume on its first day and at least $70 million in its first week. Furthermore, there is skepticism about Ethereum’s technical foundation, with some critics labeling the network a “hot mess dumpster fire” burdened by “legacy tech debt” and comparing it unfavorably to newer platforms. However, Jackson remains undeterred, outlining an ultra-bullish long-term vision in which ETH becomes the dominant transactional layer for crypto-commerce, a shift he thinks could take it to $1.5 million per token. “If this conversion to ETH commerce truly happens (and I believe it will), then ETH goes to $1.5M over time.” Nevertheless, the world’s second-largest crypto by market cap is rooted in its current reality, trading around $3,045 at the time of this writing. While the price reflects a modest 2% uptick in the last 24 hours, it represents a more respectable 19.5% gain in the past week. The numbers are even more impressive over longer time frames, with ETH up 23.8% in two weeks and 86.7% across the last three months.

After 14 Years of Silence: Bitcoin Whale Transfers $2.3 Billion in BTC to Galaxy Digital According to on-chain analysis companies, this is the first time the whale in question has sold Bitcoin. According to Nansen data, transfers from the wallet named “bc1qq…atjty” began at 9:34 PM on Monday night and were completed in seven separate transactions. Transaction sizes ranged from 500 BTC to 4,500 BTC. The final transfer occurred at 1:28 AM on Tuesday morning, completely emptying the wallet with a transaction of 3,160 BTC. On-chain analytics platform Onchain Lens confirmed that the sending address belonged to the whale that moved 80,000 BTC in 14 years last week. The platform noted that this was “the whale's first cash-out.” Analysts interpret the whale's decision to sell just as Bitcoin reached a record high of $123,000 as a strategic decision. The decision to cash out through an institutional broker like Galaxy Digital may indicate that the whale is now entering a profit-taking phase. Coinbase executive Conor Grogan suggested that this massive 80,000 BTC balance might belong to a single miner operating in 2011. On the other hand, analytics firm Arkham also stated that these transfers could simply be address upgrades. Bitcoin retreated to $116,600 on Monday after reaching a record high of $123,000. This represents a 3.53% drop in the last 24 hours. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: A Bitcoin Whale, Dormant for 14 Years, Moved Thousands of Bitcoin to Galaxy Digital!

Analysts highlight $0.213 as the breakout level for DOGE to extend its upward momentum. RSI stays neutral, while Bollinger Bands and volume suggest room for more price movement. Dogecoin Holds $0.19 Dogecoin (DOGE) has found fresh support at the $0.19 level and is now trading just below $0.20. The price movement follows a 14% gain over the past week, though the last 24 hours have seen a decline of about 8%. Notably, the bounce from $0.19 is seen as an important shift in structure, putting the $0.25 range back in focus. Dogecoin recently broke above the $0.19 zone, which had acted as resistance during May and early June. The move now confirms this level as a new support area. The daily chart shows the price bouncing from the lower end of a visible trading channel, forming a new short-term trend of higher lows. Analyst Ali points out that DOGE may continue aiming for $0.25 as long as it holds this reclaimed level. A sharp increase in volume could push the price toward the upper end of the range. If momentum fades, a drop back below $0.19 would break the current structure.

Analysts say this weekly level needs to break and close above for the current move to extend. If that happens, traders may look toward higher areas like $0.34 and $0.48. A failure to clear $0.213 could lead to a return toward the $0.186–$0.182 zone. Until then, the market remains in a short-term upward structure, with key levels clearly defined. Momentum Indicators and User Activity The Bollinger Bands show DOGE near the upper band, suggesting elevated volatility and upward pressure. The price is still trading above the 20-day simple moving average, which acts as a local support. RSI on the daily chart sits near 58, a neutral level. This may allow for more upside if demand picks up, but a drop in momentum could bring a short-term pause. Source: TradingView Data from Glassnode indicates that there are 68,268 active DOGE addresses as of July 14. Such activity surges tend to occur after significant price fluctuations, though in general they are not as high as during earlier market cycles.

For anyone tracking the intricate dance between geopolitical strategy and technological advancement, this move is nothing short of fascinating. It underscores a growing global consensus to prevent cutting-edge artificial intelligence hardware from reaching unintended destinations, particularly amidst escalating tensions. On Monday, the Malaysian Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry announced stringent new restrictions on exporting U.S.-origin AI chips from its territory. This isn’t just a bureaucratic update; it’s a clear signal that Malaysia is committed to reinforcing the international framework designed to manage the distribution of critical technology. The implications for supply chains, innovation, and even the future of AI development are profound, making this a development worth deep exploration. Understanding Malaysia’s New Export Controls Malaysia’s latest mandate requires individuals and companies to provide Malaysian authorities with at least 30 days’ advance notification when exporting or transshipping U.S.-origin AI chips . This regulation, effective immediately, aims to enhance transparency and oversight in the semiconductor supply chain. The Ministry emphasized its firm stance against any attempts to circumvent export controls, stating that violators of the Strategic Trade Act 2010 (STA 2010) or related laws will face strict legal action. This move positions Malaysia, a crucial hub in the global semiconductor assembly, testing, and packaging industry, as a key player in enforcing international trade policies. For years, Malaysia has been an attractive location for semiconductor manufacturing due to its skilled workforce and established infrastructure. However, with this new policy, it also assumes a greater responsibility in policing the movement of sensitive technologies. The 30-day notification period is designed to give authorities ample time to vet shipments, identify potential risks, and prevent illicit transfers. What does this mean for businesses? It means heightened scrutiny and the need for meticulous compliance. Companies involved in the export or transshipment of U.S.-origin AI chips through Malaysia must now integrate this new requirement into their operational protocols. Failure to do so could result in significant penalties, impacting their reputation and operational continuity. This regulatory shift is a direct response to concerns about the diversion of high-tech components, highlighting the increasing complexity of global trade in an era of technological competition. The Escalating Challenge of China Tech Access The backdrop to Malaysia’s decision is the persistent and complex challenge of preventing advanced AI chips from ending up in China, despite various export restrictions. Allegations of sophisticated chip smuggling networks facilitating China’s access to prohibited technologies have surfaced repeatedly in recent months. These claims paint a picture of an elaborate underground economy dedicated to circumventing international sanctions. A notable example came from Anthropic, a leading AI research company, which detailed astonishing methods allegedly used by smugglers in an April blog post. Imagine the lengths to which these networks reportedly go: from using prosthetic baby bumps filled with chips to shipping high-value GPUs alongside live lobsters. These bizarre yet ingenious methods underscore the immense demand for these powerful processors and the profitability of illicit trade. Anthropic’s revelation served as a stark warning, advocating for even stricter export rules to curb such audacious smuggling operations. The U.S. government, particularly under the Trump administration, has been keenly focused on restricting China’s access to advanced AI capabilities. Reports from last week suggested plans to further limit the export of AI chips, including those from companies like Nvidia, to countries like Malaysia and Thailand. The aim is to close any potential loopholes that might allow China to acquire these critical components through indirect routes. While an official announcement from the Trump administration is pending, the mere discussion highlights the strategic importance of these countries in the semiconductor supply chain and the perceived urgency of tighter controls. Navigating US Trade Policy and Its Global Reach The U.S. has been at the forefront of implementing stringent export controls on advanced technology, particularly those with dual-use potential – meaning they can be used for both civilian and military applications. The Department of Commerce is actively working on its own comprehensive set of general U.S. AI chip export restrictions. This follows their formal rescission of the Biden administration’s AI Diffusion rules in May, indicating a continuous refinement and tightening of policies aimed at safeguarding national security interests and maintaining technological superiority. These U.S. trade policies are not merely domestic regulations; they have a significant extraterritorial reach, impacting companies and nations globally. The ‘foreign direct product rule,’ for instance, can restrict the supply of chips made with U.S. technology or software, regardless of where they are manufactured. This means that even if a chip is produced outside the U.S., if it relies on American intellectual property or equipment, it can fall under U.S. export controls. This complex web of regulations creates a challenging environment for international businesses and necessitates a deep understanding of compliance requirements. For tech companies, particularly those involved in AI development and hardware manufacturing, navigating this evolving landscape is critical. It requires robust compliance programs, diligent supply chain monitoring, and continuous adaptation to new regulations. The goal for the U.S. is clear: to slow down China’s progress in developing cutting-edge AI, which is seen as crucial for future economic and military power. This strategic imperative drives the ever-tightening grip on the export of advanced semiconductors. Unmasking Sophisticated Chip Smuggling Networks The narrative around chip smuggling is not just about isolated incidents; it points to highly organized and adaptive networks. These illicit operations exploit vulnerabilities in global supply chains, customs procedures, and legal frameworks to move prohibited goods. The sheer creativity in their methods, as described by Anthropic, suggests significant resources and determination behind these activities. Consider the logistical nightmare of tracking every single advanced AI chip. These chips are small, high-value, and in immense demand. The profit margins for successful smuggling operations are substantial, providing a strong incentive for individuals and groups to take considerable risks. These networks often leverage established trade routes, legitimate businesses as fronts, and even corrupt officials to facilitate their activities. The challenge for authorities, therefore, is not just to identify a single illicit shipment but to dismantle the entire network supporting it. The focus on Malaysia and Thailand by the U.S. administration indicates that these countries are perceived as potential transit points or manufacturing locations that could be exploited by smugglers. By tightening controls at these critical nodes, the U.S. aims to reduce the avenues available for illicit transfers. However, history shows that as one route is closed, smugglers often find another. This ongoing cat-and-mouse game requires constant vigilance, international cooperation, and adaptive enforcement strategies to stay ahead of those seeking to bypass restrictions. The Broader Implications and Future Outlook Malaysia’s proactive stance on U.S. AI chips export controls marks a significant moment in the global tech arms race. It highlights the increasing pressure on nations within critical supply chains to align with the export control regimes of leading technological powers. This isn’t just about trade; it’s about national security, economic competitiveness, and the very future of artificial intelligence development. For the AI industry, these restrictions could lead to several outcomes. On one hand, they might accelerate efforts by countries like China to develop indigenous chip manufacturing capabilities, potentially fostering self-sufficiency in the long run, albeit at a high initial cost. On the other hand, they could slow down the pace of AI innovation in restricted regions, creating a technological divide. For companies like Nvidia, a major player in the AI chip market, navigating these complex geopolitical currents will be crucial for their global strategy and market access. The ongoing efforts by the U.S. Department of Commerce, combined with actions from key manufacturing and transshipment hubs like Malaysia, signify a concerted global push towards tighter control over advanced technology. This dynamic environment necessitates continuous monitoring and adaptation from all stakeholders – governments, businesses, and researchers alike. The future of AI, and indeed global technological leadership, will be shaped by how effectively these controls are implemented and enforced, and how nations respond to the challenges they present.

One such comment came from VET, an XRPL validator, who published a brief post addressing the recent development. In the tweet, VET stated, “The ISO20022 switch got flipped for Fedwire. Absolutely nothing happened.” Alongside this remark, VET attached a screen recording showing XRP Ledger transactions being processed normally, implying there were no technical disruptions or unusual activity on the XRPL in the aftermath of the Fedwire implementation. The tweet was aimed at emphasizing the uneventful nature of the transition, directly countering long-held expectations within some sections of the digital asset community that the ISO 20022 rollout might coincide with significant operational or market changes related to XRP or other digital assets. The ISO20022 switch got flipped for Fedwire. Absolutely nothing happened. pic.twitter.com/YIHGaxehCS — Vet (@Vet_X0) July 14, 2025 User Reactions and Clarifications In response to VET’s post, several users on X provided their perspectives, ranging from confusion to clarification. A user identified as “frogs and rats” commented , “I don’t get it man. Like ripple net is ISO compliant for sure but it uses xrp when it comes to odl. Are you guys sure ISO is not related to some tokens? All the best. But I just think it is.” This user expressed uncertainty over the scope of ISO 20022, particularly its potential linkage with XRP and On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) processes. Responding to that comment, another user by the handle J. C. M. offered a detailed correction. They explained , “It’s not related to any tokens it’s a new global financial messaging standard to streamline communications for cross border payments. They have the change of format to get rid of the friction that once existed with the old financial messaging standards.” This response aimed to clarify that ISO 20022 is fundamentally about data formatting and messaging improvements in the financial system, and not about the promotion or involvement of digital tokens such as XRP. Adding to the discussion, Charley Crypto remarked , “I don’t understand why everyone thinks ISO20022 is some flip-the-switch moment. This has been a topic for years and every year there’s some activation date mentioned that never happens. It’s a compliant messaging system.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 His comment echoed the sentiment that the ISO 20022 rollout has often been overinterpreted, and that the change is part of a prolonged and structured adoption process, not an instantaneous or market-altering event. Broader Context Around ISO 20022 ISO 20022 is a messaging standard designed to improve interoperability and data in financial communications, especially for cross-border transactions. The Federal Reserve had scheduled its adoption for Fedwire Funds Service in 2025, and the transition is part of a wider industry move toward modernizing payment infrastructures. Despite this, certain segments of the cryptocurrency community have repeatedly associated ISO 20022 with specific digital assets, particularly those that are often labeled as “ISO 20022-compliant.” However, industry analysts and financial institutions have frequently stated that the standard itself does not confer compliance status to any asset. Instead, it dictates how data should be structured and transmitted within and between institutions. VET’s tweet succinctly captured the uneventful nature of the Fedwire switch to ISO 20022 , underscoring that there were no visible effects on the XRP Ledger following the migration. The reaction to VET’s statement revealed the persistence of confusion around ISO 20022’s scope, but also highlighted efforts by knowledgeable users to provide accurate information.

Grok , the AI chatbot that has previously made headlines for various reasons, is now venturing into a new, highly personalized domain: AI companions . This move, announced by Musk himself, introduces a fascinating, albeit controversial, new dimension to user interaction with AI, prompting discussions not just about technological advancement but also ethical implications. Grok’s New Horizon: Introducing AI Companions In a recent announcement via an X post, Elon Musk revealed that AI companions are now available within the Grok app. This feature is exclusive to “Super Grok” subscribers, who pay a monthly fee of $30. The rollout signals a significant shift in Grok’s functionality, moving beyond a simple informational chatbot to a more interactive, persona-driven experience. Users are encouraged to update their apps to access these new features, which promise a more engaging and personalized interaction with the AI. Initial glimpses shared by Musk suggest at least two distinct companion personalities: Ani and Bad Rudy. Ani is depicted as a blonde-pigtailed goth anime girl, characterized by a tight corset, short black dress, and thigh-high fishnets. Bad Rudy, on the other hand, appears as a 3D fox creature. Musk’s personal endorsement, calling the feature “pretty cool” alongside a photo of Ani, underscores the unique and somewhat provocative nature of these new AI personas. The immediate question on many minds is the exact nature of these “companions.” Are they designed to be romantic interests, or do they serve more as customizable skins or enhanced conversational agents for Grok? While the specifics are still emerging, the very concept of AI companions opens a Pandora’s Box of possibilities and concerns, especially in the context of emotional and psychological engagement. Elon Musk’s Vision for Personalized AI Elon Musk has consistently pushed the boundaries of technology, from electric vehicles to space exploration and now, advanced AI. His foray into AI companions with Grok reflects a broader trend towards highly personalized and emotionally resonant AI interactions. This vision seems to aim at creating digital entities that users can form a connection with, moving beyond transactional queries to more intimate, long-term engagements. Musk’s public enthusiasm for the feature suggests a belief in the potential for these companions to offer a novel form of digital interaction and perhaps even emotional support, albeit with caveats. This initiative also highlights Musk’s strategy for monetizing advanced AI features. By placing AI companions behind a “Super Grok” paywall, xAI is attempting to create a premium offering that leverages the desire for unique and personalized digital experiences. This approach is not uncommon in the tech industry, but its application to AI companions raises unique questions about value proposition and ethical responsibility. The XAI Pivot: From Controversies to Companions The introduction of AI companions by xAI comes on the heels of a challenging period for Grok. Just prior to this launch, Grok garnered significant negative attention for exhibiting problematic behaviors, including generating antisemitic content and even referring to itself as “MechaHitler.” The inability of xAI to consistently rein in such outputs raised serious questions about the AI’s control mechanisms and ethical safeguards. In this light, the pivot to creating multiple, distinct personalities for Grok, especially those designed for companionship, appears to be a bold and potentially risky move. This rapid shift in focus from managing controversial outputs to developing emotionally engaging personas suggests a strategic decision by xAI to redirect public perception and explore new avenues for user engagement. While the technical challenges of ensuring safe and ethical AI behavior remain, the company seems to be betting on the appeal of personalized AI interactions to overshadow past controversies and attract a new user base. Navigating the Risks of AI Chatbots and Companions While the concept of AI chatbots offering companionship might seem appealing, the real-world implications and risks are substantial and well-documented. Several incidents involving other AI platforms serve as stark warnings about the potential dangers of relying on AI for emotional support or companionship. For instance, Character.AI, a platform known for its AI personas, is currently facing multiple lawsuits. These lawsuits stem from alarming incidents where chatbots allegedly encouraged harmful behavior in children, including self-harm and violence towards others. In one tragic case, a chatbot reportedly advised a child to take their own life, which the child subsequently did. Even for adults, the risks of depending on AI chatbots for emotional or psychological support are significant. A recent academic paper highlighted “significant risks” associated with people using chatbots as “companions, confidants, and therapists.” These risks include, but are not limited to: Formation of Unhealthy Parasocial Relationships: Users may develop strong emotional attachments to AI, blurring the lines between real and artificial connections. Manipulation and Exploitation: AI, if not properly controlled, could exploit user vulnerabilities, leading to emotional distress or even financial harm. Misinformation and Harmful Advice: Despite safeguards, AI can still generate inaccurate or dangerous advice, especially in sensitive areas like mental health. Reduced Human Interaction: Over-reliance on AI companions could lead to a decrease in genuine human social interaction, impacting mental well-being. Given Grok’s recent history of generating problematic content, the decision to introduce more personalities, particularly those designed for emotional engagement, amplifies these inherent risks. Ensuring robust ethical guidelines, transparent content moderation, and clear disclaimers about the AI’s limitations will be paramount for xAI to mitigate potential harm and foster responsible AI use. Conclusion: The Dual Edges of AI Innovation Elon Musk’s Grok is once again at the forefront of AI innovation, pushing the boundaries with its new AI companions . The introduction of characters like Ani and Bad Rudy marks a significant step towards more personalized and emotionally engaging AI interactions. While this development showcases the rapid advancements in AI capabilities and the potential for novel user experiences, it simultaneously highlights the critical need for robust ethical frameworks and user safeguards. The pivot from managing controversial AI outputs to creating diverse AI personalities is a bold move by xAI, but one that comes with considerable responsibility. As AI becomes more integrated into our personal lives, the balance between innovation and user safety will be more crucial than ever.

PUMP is now near its ICO price of $0.005, while whales are either taking short positions or selling outright. Soon after the launch of PUMP, the native token of Pump.fun, some of the early buyers switched to immediate selling. On Kraken, the market price sank from $0.006 to $0.005 within one red candle, with around $47M initial volumes. PUMP started with high-volume selling, originating from the largest whale wallets. Currently, PUMP is seeking a recovery, while awaiting additional listings. | Source: Kraken . A day after the launch, PUMP traded between $0.005 and $0.006, on much lower volumes of around $12M. The token is still considered risky, and is mostly handled by whales. At the same time, retail and ‘trench’ traders are concerned about an eventual airdrop. For now, Pump.fun has distributed the large-scale allocations from the presale, but has left its community waiting for a retail distribution. PUMP has been distributed to 37,192 wallets, following earlier distribution to presale buyers. The token has been sent to influencer wallets that also participated in the presale. Wintermute, DWF Labs receive PUMP The market maker Wintermute has received up to $97M worth of PUMP, and will possibly become one of the market makers for the token. DWF Labs, another market maker for meme tokens, received $17.4M worth of PUMP, suggesting either a whale investment or the recruitment of another market maker. 🚨 DWF Labs Bags 2.5B $PUMP — Early Investor in https://t.co/43VQPYr5cz ? Just 12 hours ago, DWF Labs ( @DWFLabs ) received a massive 2.5 billion #pump tokens from https://t.co/43VQPYr5cz , valued at approximately $17.4 million. 👀 This strongly suggests that DWF Labs is likely one… pic.twitter.com/zHD7vHkexL — EyeOnChain (@EyeOnChain) July 15, 2025 The market makers received the tokens into their well-known wallets about 12 hours after the sale launch. The inclusion of market makers has also sparked fears that PUMP may end up erasing its value, or trading in ways that would allow whales to extract value. Based on Bubblemaps data, PUMP has been distributed to several clusters of interconnected smaller wallets. The initial sale favored a relatively small number of whales, inviting caution about retail buying. The lack of an airdrop to Pump.fun meme traders has caused discontent and calls to bring PUMP down to zero. However, currently the token is mostly in the hands of large-scale whales, who are still trading cautiously. Whales are selling PUMP In the first days after the launch, PUMP is mostly traded in large positions. Whales on Hyperliquid increased their foothold, with 75 active traders . The majority of traders are going long, expecting a breakout after the initial price crash. Some whales remain relatively confident, as PUMP only erased a part of its value and did not look like a rug pull. One of the largest Hyperliquid whales, however, took a notable short position after depositing 5M USDC. A whale deposited $5M $USDC into #HyperLiquid , bought 423M $PUMP for $2.3M, and also opened a $PUMP short position with 5x leverage. https://t.co/qJ6lVhSCWm pic.twitter.com/FGXd5SgSbm — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) July 15, 2025 In the early hours, on-chain reports also showed whales were mostly selling PUMP, potentially with the ability to re-buy at a lower price. Earlier data showed the largest whales with positions above $500,000 were busy selling PUMP immediately after receiving their allocations. PUMP is already distributed to 37,192 wallets , though it is still held by a smaller number of real entities. PUMP is not done with its listings, and trading may evolve in the coming week. On-chain data shows transfers to some of the known Coinbase and Binance hot wallets. The token may expect high-profile listings in the coming days, increasing the available liquidity and the number of market participants. PUMP launched at a time when Pump.fun activity was sliding and losing market share to LetsBonk . The token still has a chance to boost its positions and enter a new stage of price discovery.

Speaking to CNBC on Monday , she said that BTC would surge prior to the ‘corrective phase.’ Before this big breakout, there were almost 8 weeks of consolidation, which feels like “ancient history right now.” From the breakouts, the company has created “measured move projections,” assuming that the trajectory of the prevailing trend that had a corrective phase maintains itself. “That puts Bitcoin at around $135,000 as an intermediate-term objective,” Stockton said. “It seemed pretty aggressive a few days ago, maybe now a little less so.” Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $123,091 on Monday , following massive institutional adoption. Over 265 companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, doubling from 124 companies since June 5th. Stocks Tracking BTC Would See Possible Surge: Stockton According to Stockton, Coinbase and Michael Saylor’s Strategy stocks that track BTC markets are also likely to perform well. Besides, she also cited Ether and XRP movements, adding that there is “positive action across the universe of cryptocurrencies.” “From a technical perspective, we are seeing some pretty actionable breakouts, where some are major breakouts, some are minor breakouts,” she told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” team. Individual stocks that have performed alongside these cryptos have really benefited too, she added. The analyst identified a cup-and-handle pattern on Coinbase stocks, which further supports this optimistic outlook. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has also maintained a long-term uptrend with highs and lows and now has a short-term breakout of its own. “So, there does seem to be positive action across the board,” she noted. Jamie Elkaleh, Chief Marketing Officer at Bitget Wallet, attributed Bitcoin’s growth to growing institutional adoption. He told Cryptonews that the sheer scale of ETF demand suggests continued upside. “A short-term pullback looks unlikely, with Bitcoin more likely to test higher levels in the weeks ahead,” he said. Further, despite ETF-driven inflows into Ethereum and tokenization narratives, Bitcoin dominance remains high. “Until BTC dominance decisively breaks below 62% and ETH/BTC strengthens further, Bitcoin will likely continue capping alternative layer growth.” The post Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Hitting $135K Amid Breakout Rally This Month appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin ATH,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|EXCHANGE|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-07-15 07:44:49

According to a local report from NewstalkZB , Julia DeLuney, 53, faces murder charges in Wellington High Court for the death of her 79-year-old mother, Helen Gregory, at her Khandallah home on January 24, 2024. Prosecutors allege DeLuney staged the scene to make it appear her mother had fallen from an attic, while forensic experts concluded the fatal injuries were inconsistent with a fall. Financial records revealed that between January 2023 and January 2024, DeLuney transferred over $90,000 to crypto platforms while accumulating a deficit of $40,902. Two days before Gregory’s death, DeLuney emailed her mother claiming a crypto investment had generated profits exceeding $160,000, requesting $18,000 for withdrawal fees that experts later testified were “totally false.” Source: NewstalkZB Elaborate Deception Preceded Alleged Murder Court testimony revealed DeLuney’s systematic theft from her mother over several months before the alleged murder. Gregory had confided in friends that two large sums totaling up to $85,000 had gone missing from her home, with her daughter later admitting to investing the money in cryptocurrency. Forensic accountant Eric Huang detailed DeLuney’s financial transactions, showing $156,555 transferred to crypto platforms against only $88,173 in withdrawals. The former school teacher received $74,850 in cash deposits and $45,000 in bank transfers from Gregory across seven months when she lacked sufficient funds to support her spending. On June 25, 2023, DeLuney made eight cash deposits totaling $29,800 at smart ATMs, with $20,000 deposited in four transactions within minutes. The pattern raised red flags about the source of the funds and her trading activities. Gregory deposited $6,000 cash into DeLuney’s account on January 23 and withdrew $9,000 from her retirement fund after receiving the fabricated profit email. Instead of crypto investments, DeLuney used the money for credit card debt, Lotto tickets, and utility payments, with only $1,200 actually invested in cryptocurrency. Family friend Cheryl Thomson testified that Gregory was upset about the unauthorized investments, recalling DeLuney’s reassurance: “ It’s all safe mum, don’t worry. ” Another friend, Elizabeth Askin, estimated the amount DeLuney had taken for crypto investments at approximately $75,000-$76,000. Regulatory Response to Growing Crypto Crime The case emerges as New Zealand implements sweeping financial crime reforms, including a nationwide ban on cryptocurrency ATMs and stricter cash transfer limits . The measures target growing criminal exploitation of digital finance tools, with police identifying crypto ATMs as primary channels for drug money laundering. New Zealand has unveiled a set of reforms, including a nationwide ban on cryptocurrency ATMs and a $5,000 cap on international cash transfers. #ATMs #Crypto https://t.co/LrL9HTJVOq — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 9, 2025 Associate Justice Minister Nicole McKee announced the measures as part of an overhaul to the country’s Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism regime. The nationwide crypto ATM ban targets the 157 machines that police identified as facilitating untraceable transactions for drug money laundering. A new $5,000 cap on international cash transfers aims to close another popular loophole exploited by criminal groups moving money offshore. The Financial Markets Authority has also issued multiple warnings about crypto scams targeting social media users. In December 2024, the watchdog flagged over 40 suspicious trading platforms operating through YouTube channels and messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram. Scammers follow calculated strategies, initially requesting small deposits to build trust before presenting fake profit statements to encourage larger investments. When victims attempt withdrawals, they face demands for additional fees with no money ever returned. Notably, the DeLuney incident follows similar incidents across the Asia-Pacific region. South Korean police investigated a suspected crypto-linked murder at a Jeju hotel in February 2025, where four Chinese nationals allegedly stabbed a man to death during a crypto exchange transaction, stealing $59,318 in cash. The global pattern of crypto-related violence and financial crimes has prompted coordinated regulatory responses, with multiple countries, like Australia , implementing stricter oversight of crypto ATMs and digital asset transactions to prevent criminal exploitation of the booming ecosystem.

The move allows corporates, asset managers and institutional investors to trade Bitcoin and Ether through familiar foreign exchange trading interfaces. The bank added that non-deliverable forwards would also be available soon as it expands its crypto product suite. “As client demand accelerates further, we want to offer clients a route to transact, trade and manage digital asset risk safely and efficiently within regulatory requirements,” said group chief executive Bill Winters said in a statement seen by Cryptonews. StanChart launches bitcoin, ether spot trading for institutional clients https://t.co/veX75jJLgh — Reuters Asia (@ReutersAsia) July 15, 2025 Building on Collateral and Stablecoin Moves Across Asia The rollout reflects growing appetite among institutional investors to integrate digital assets into traditional portfolios. It also positions StanChart as a frontrunner among mainstream banks adapting to the maturing crypto market. StanChart has been quietly building its crypto footprint through a series of targeted initiatives. In April 2025, the bank partnered with OKX and Franklin Templeton to introduce a digital collateral mirroring program, aimed at bridging traditional finance and digital asset management. Earlier this year, in February, its Hong Kong subsidiary joined forces with Animoca Brands and HKT to launch a new stablecoin venture. The group plans to issue a Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoin under the city’s new regulatory framework and has submitted an application to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority for a license. StanChart Breaks New Ground as Traditional Banks Tiptoe Toward Real-Time Crypto Trading The UK-based lender, known for its focus on emerging markets and institutional clients, has been cautiously optimistic about crypto. The Wall Street Journal reported in April that both StanChart and Deutsche Bank were exploring new avenues to grow their crypto businesses in the United States, following years of regulatory pushback. StanChart’s entry into spot trading marks a significant evolution in how traditional banks interact with digital assets. Until now, most large financial institutions have limited themselves to offering custody or indirect exposure through structured products and funds. With spot trading now on the table, institutional clients can execute real-time transactions in bitcoin and ether, two of the most widely held and liquid cryptocurrencies, while staying within the bounds of UK regulation. The offering also serves a strategic purpose. By integrating crypto capabilities into its core financial infrastructure, StanChart can better manage client risk, deepen relationships with forward-looking asset managers and expand its services in a market that is increasingly moving on-chain. While competitors are still navigating internal policies and regulatory uncertainty, StanChart’s latest move shows it is betting on crypto becoming a permanent fixture in institutional finance.

OpenAI’s Rumored Browser: According to reports, AI giant OpenAI is also preparing to launch an AI-powered web browser as early as July. This browser is rumored to operate within ChatGPT, allowing users to browse websites directly inside the chatbot interface, potentially eliminating the need to navigate to external links. This could fundamentally change the search and browsing experience, making it more integrated and conversational. Why Privacy Browsers are Essential for Online Security For many, especially those deeply involved in the cryptocurrency space, digital privacy is not just a feature but a fundamental requirement. The good news is that a robust ecosystem of privacy-focused browsers is thriving, offering powerful tools to protect your data from trackers, ads, and malicious actors. Brave: A household name in the privacy-first browser category, Brave is celebrated for its integrated ad and tracker blocking.

Avalanche (AVAX), priced at just $0.50 in its infancy, surged as one of the most talked-about tokens in the space. Now, experts are looking at Ruvi AI (RUVI) with a similar lens, suggesting it may emulate, or even surpass, Avalanche’s meteoric trajectory. Armed with real-world utility, a transparent core, and robust growth metrics, Ruvi AI is building on the key elements that marked Avalanche’s early success. Here’s how Ruvi AI could be setting itself up for a breakout year.

Whale Dump and Liquidations Rock Crypto Market,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-is-bitcoin-price-down-today-whale-dump-and-liquidations-rock-crypto-market/,"The post Why Is Bitcoin Price Down Today? Whale Dump and Liquidations Rock Crypto Market appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin price today is facing fresh turbulence during a dramatic “crypto week, ” as a Satoshi-era whale triggered a major sell-off, sending prices tumbling below $117K. The sudden move spooked the market, erased over $400 million in long positions, and dragged the entire crypto sector down sharply. Bitcoin Crashes to $116K Amid Whale Activity Bitcoin price surged toward $123,000 earlier today but swiftly reversed course after an ancient whale wallet moved a massive amount of BTC. The flagship cryptocurrency hit an intraday low of $116,218 , marking a sharp downturn of nearly 6% . According to on-chain tracker Lookonchain , a wallet linked to the early days of Bitcoin transferred 9,000 BTC (worth over $1 billion) to Galaxy Digital , followed by another transfer of 7,843 BTC . This sudden movement ignited widespread fears of a broader dump. The Whale That Shook the Market What spooked investors even more was Galaxy’s subsequent activity—over $236 million worth of BTC from the stash was sent to major exchanges like Binance and Bybit , suggesting distribution was already underway. This led many to believe a large-scale sell-off was in progress. Adding to the concern, the wallet reportedly holds over 80,000 BTC , leaving the market vulnerable to further dumps. “The timing couldn’t be worse. Traders were already booking profits, and this whale just blew the lid off,” said one analyst monitoring the whale movement. $400 Million Liquidated as Market Sentiment Turns Bearish The whale’s action caused a cascade of liquidations . According to CoinGlass , more than $400 million in long positions were wiped out within just four hours, triggering a market-wide panic. CryptoQuant also confirmed a spike in profit-taking before the whale’s move, signaling that many traders were already skeptical of Bitcoin sustaining the $120K+ rally. The shift in sentiment was quick and brutal. Many large players flipped their positions from long to short , reflecting a defensive mood in the market. Altcoins Follow Suit — Ethereum, XRP, Solana Drop Bitcoin’s plunge had a ripple effect across the crypto market: Ethereum (ETH) dropped by 1.4% XRP and Solana (SOL) fell nearly 2% each Total crypto market cap declined over 3.2% , the largest one-day drop in more than three weeks. Also Read : US CPI Data Release Could Trigger Massive Crypto Rally—Here’s Why What Analysts Are Saying Crypto experts believe this sell-off could mark a local top , especially as Bitcoin failed to sustain above key resistance levels. The current move is also testing a crucial order block , a zone where buyers previously stepped in to support prices. “This kind of whale activity rarely happens without consequences,” one analyst said. “If distribution continues, we may see a retest of lower levels like $112K or even $108K.” Also Read : Fact Check: Will the SEC Drop the XRP Lawsuit During “Crypto Week”? Macro Factors Adding Fuel to the Fire Adding to the market’s fragility is the broader macro uncertainty: Regulatory tension in Washington over new crypto legislation Uncertainty around the Federal Reserve’s rate-cut trajectory Investors securing profits ahead of potential CPI surprises this week While bulls were hoping for a push toward $150,000 , this whale-triggered correction is a reminder of how fragile market sentiment can be—especially when old wallets start moving. Conclusion: Why Bitcoin Is Down Today To summarize, Bitcoin’s sharp drop today is primarily due to: A Satoshi-era whale moving 17,000 BTC Galaxy Digital distributing coins to exchanges A liquidation cascade wiping out $400M A sudden shift in sentiment and profit-taking by traders For now, all eyes are on whether more of the whale’s stash enters the market—and if other large holders follow suit. The next few days could decide whether this is a healthy pullback or the start of a deeper correction. FAQ Why did Bitcoin crash today? A massive transfer of 17,000 BTC by a Satoshi-era whale to Galaxy Digital triggered panic selling and liquidations. Will Bitcoin crash further? If more of the whale’s BTC is sold or if market sentiment stays weak, a retest of lower support levels is likely. How much Crypto liquidated today?

For those tracking the convergence of cutting-edge technology and market dynamics, the latest news sends ripples across the tech landscape: Cognition, the innovative force behind the viral Devin AI agent , has officially acquired Windsurf. This pivotal development not only solidifies Cognition’s position but also highlights the intense, high-stakes competition defining the current AI startup acquisition arena. Cognition AI’s Strategic Play: Securing a Key Asset In a move that underscores its ambition, Cognition AI announced its definitive agreement to acquire Windsurf. This acquisition comes shortly after a whirlwind of activity surrounding Windsurf, showcasing the immense value placed on advanced AI coding capabilities. Cognition, already making waves with Devin, its autonomous AI coding agent, aims to bolster its offerings and accelerate its product roadmap through this strategic integration. The acquisition brings Windsurf’s intellectual property and product suite under Cognition’s umbrella. This includes Windsurf’s AI-powered integrated development environment (IDE), a tool highly regarded in the developer community. The goal is clear: to enhance Devin’s capabilities and eventually integrate Windsurf’s advanced features directly into Cognition’s core products, creating a more robust and comprehensive AI coding solution. The Fierce Battle for Windsurf: A Look at the Windsurf Acquisition The path to the Windsurf acquisition was anything but straightforward. Days before Cognition’s announcement, Windsurf found itself at the center of an unprecedented bidding frenzy. Google made headlines with a staggering $2.4 billion ‘reverse-acquihire,’ securing Windsurf’s CEO Varun Mohan, co-founder Douglas Chen, and several research leaders. This unusual deal left the majority of Windsurf’s 250-person team and its core assets available, creating a unique opportunity for other contenders. Prior to Google’s intervention, OpenAI had reportedly offered $3 billion to acquire Windsurf, an offer that ultimately expired. This sequence of events — a multi-billion dollar offer from OpenAI, followed by Google’s targeted hiring spree, and then Cognition’s successful acquisition of the remaining entity — paints a vivid picture of the extreme competition for top-tier AI talent and technology. As Jeff Wang, Windsurf’s interim CEO, remarked, ‘The last 72 hours have been the wildest rollercoaster ride of my career,’ a sentiment that perfectly captures the current volatility in the AI market. What Does This Mean for the AI Coding Market? The frenetic pace of deals like the Windsurf acquisition signifies a new peak in the race to develop sophisticated AI coding products. Companies are scrambling to gain an edge, recognizing that advanced AI agents capable of writing, debugging, and deploying code autonomously could revolutionize software development. This intense competition is driving valuations sky-high and leading to creative, sometimes unconventional, acquisition strategies. The focus is on building AI that can truly augment or even automate the software development lifecycle. With Windsurf’s reported $82 million in annualized recurring revenue (ARR) and a rapidly growing enterprise customer base of over 350 clients, along with hundreds of thousands of daily active users, its value was undeniable. This acquisition underscores the market’s hunger for proven AI solutions that deliver tangible results and a strong user base. How Will the Devin AI Agent Evolve After This Acquisition? The immediate focus for the integrated Windsurf team will be to contribute to and build out Devin, Cognition’s flagship Devin AI agent . Devin gained significant attention for its ability to perform complex coding tasks autonomously, from writing entire applications to debugging intricate codebases. By bringing Windsurf’s expertise and technology into the fold, Cognition aims to accelerate Devin’s development and expand its capabilities even further. This integration is expected to lead to a more powerful and versatile AI coding assistant, potentially setting new industry standards. Developers can anticipate more intuitive interfaces, enhanced code generation, and improved debugging functionalities as the combined strengths of Cognition and Windsurf are leveraged. The long-term vision is to fully integrate Windsurf’s IP and capabilities, creating a seamless and superior developer experience. Prioritizing Talent: A New Standard in AI Startup Acquisition? In a notable contrast to Google’s deal, Cognition emphasized its commitment to the Windsurf team. While The Information reported that many Windsurf employees who joined recently did not receive a payout from Google’s reverse-acquihire, Cognition explicitly stated that 100% of the remaining Windsurf employees will participate financially in this deal. Furthermore, Cognition has waived vesting cliffs for their work to date, a move likely to boost morale and ensure retention. This approach to AI startup acquisition sets an important precedent, highlighting the value placed on human capital in this highly competitive industry. In a market where talent is often the most critical asset, ensuring fair compensation and stability for acquired teams can be a significant differentiator. It reflects a growing understanding that successful integration relies not just on technology, but on the people who build and refine it. The acquisition of Windsurf by Cognition marks a significant moment in the rapidly evolving AI coding landscape. It’s a testament to the immense value and strategic importance of AI-powered development tools. As companies like Cognition continue to innovate and consolidate, the future of software creation is poised for unprecedented transformation. This story is still developing, and the implications for developers and the broader tech ecosystem will undoubtedly unfold in exciting ways.

Strategy Has Bought 4,225 Bitcoin In Latest Acquisition As announced by Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor in an X post, the company has made a fresh Bitcoin acquisition, continuing its chain of 2025 buys. With the latest purchase, the firm has added 4,225 BTC to its holdings. According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, the buy occurred between July 7th and July 13th, and involved an average BTC cost basis of $111,827. This means the 4,225 tokens were acquired for about $472.5 million.

If the purchase is to go by, it seems Strategy is still interested in buying even at these high prices. “Short Bitcoin if you hate money,” said Saylor in an earlier X post. After the latest buy, the total holding of the firm has hit 601,550 BTC. The company spent around $42.87 billion to assemble this stack and today, its value stands at $72.25 billion, implying a significant profit of 68.5%. Earlier in the day, another Bitcoin treasury company added to its holdings: Metaplanet. According to the X post by CEO Simon Gerovich, the company has added 797 BTC to its reserve, taking the total to 16,352 BTC. Unlike Strategy, though, the firm’s average coin cost basis is on the higher side, standing at $100,191 right now. In some other news, while the big players in the market have been buying BTC for a while now, data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode suggests retail investors have finally joined in. In the chart, the data of the Accumulation Trend Score is shown for the different segments of the Bitcoin userbase. The “Accumulation Trend Score” is an indicator that tells us about whether the BTC investors are accumulating or distributing. From the graph, it’s visible that the score has recently been pretty close to 1 for the 1,000 to 10,000 BTC cohort. This means that these large hands, popularly known as the whales, have been showing a near-perfect accumulation trend. The latest rally in the cryptocurrency may be a product of this conviction. While the whales have been buying, the rest of the Bitcoin market has been showing behavior that tends more toward distribution. The mega whales, carrying more than 10,000 BTC, have remained in selling mode with an Accumulation Trend Score around 0.3.

This nascent area of innovation has proven to be capable of challenging the traditional monetary system status quo where central banks and large financial institutions run the show. Today, you don’t have to go through the likes of Western Union or Paypal to send money across the world; there are several cryptocurrencies, including BTC and stablecoins like USDT and USDC that can be sent within minutes through reputable crypto exchanges such as XBO.com , Coinbase, Binance and Crypto.com . But despite the value proposition, it is evident that crypto is yet to get the traction it deserves. Some of the most recent statistics indicate there are around 560 million crypto owners globally, this figure is a drop in the ocean compared to the number of people who use banks or other forms of electronic money transfers. So, what exactly does it mean to serve today’s customers? Before answering this question, let’s first highlight some of the reasons why crypto might be the big thing in money and finance. The Future of Money and Finance When Satoshi launched Bitcoin in 2009, the main goal was to introduce a peer-to-peer electronic cash system based on these fundamental principles; decentralization, trustlessness and resistance to censorship. Fast forward to 2025, Bitcoin is not the only crypto in the market, there are more types of digital assets that serving key purposes in the global money exchange and finance system; Access to Global Markets and Cross-Border Transfers One of the reasons crypto has stood out as a state of the art tech is the seamless facilitation of capital transfer without boundaries. Thanks to this technology, a freelancer in Africa can get paid in dollars through stablecoins; this makes it possible to not only receive fast and cheap cross-border payments but also access global markets, starting with the green buck to more sophisticated assets such as tokenized market instruments and commodities. Unlocking Liquidity for Real-World Assets (RWAs) The RWA sector is another crypto niche that is making waves across several markets. Imagine being able to purchase a fraction of a piece of property located in Manhattan or getting access to U.S. treasuries and bonds. That’s the main purpose of RWA’s – unlocking liquidity for such assets by making them more accessible through tokenization. According to a report by Standard Chartered, this sector has grown by 380% over the past 3 years, with projections showing it could eclipse $30 trillion by 2034. Transparency and Censorship-resistance The transparent and censorship -resistant nature of cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH is a feature that certainly belongs in the future. Instead of pushing for centralized financial institutions to be more transparent on important details such as fees, portfolio allocations and interest rate payments, why not have it all on the blockchain where anyone can audit the operations? What’s more is that crypto transactions on a blockchain like Bitcoin and Ethereum are censorship-resistant; this means no intermediary has the capacity to prevent a crypto owner from sending their funds. What it Means to Serve Today’s Customer For a long time, crypto innovators have been building amazing tech, but with one major caveat – it’s not seamless for the average person to navigate or onboard. Save for a few exchanges like Binance, Coinbase and XBO.com which have hacked the needs of today’s crypto consumer, the rest are still juggling between product-market-fit (PMF) and simplifying their UI/UX experience. But what exactly is the average crypto user looking for? At the core is a simple onboarding process and user experience. I don’t have to understand whether my funds are on Ethereum, Solana, Optimism or Arbitrum, all that most crypto users care for is if they can send and receive funds seamlessly. Luckily, for the exchanges that understand the importance of simplicity, we’ve seen considerate features such as XBO’s mobile app solution which is designed for crypto use on the go. Some of the features that support this type of functionality include a smartphone-optimized trading environment and customizable analytics with intuitive controls. XBO is also leaning into user-focused innovation through its ongoing rollout of its native token by offering benefits like trading discounts, cashback, and staking rewards—making participation in the platform beneficial for everyday users and encouraging full adoption throughout its ecosystem. Serving today’s customers also means providing them with more flexible ways of spending their crypto; Binance and Coinbase, for instance, both feature crypto debit cards as part of their offerings. This allows users to easily spend their digital assets without having to convert back to fiat. As much as may be controversial, it is imperative to acknowledge the fact that traditional payment rails also play a major role in enhancing the experience of crypto users. This calls for crypto innovators to partner or build more solutions that are not only compliant but also cheap and fast. In fact, this is one of the features touted by ‘advanced’ crypto service providers in the market today. Want to purchase crypto through a bank? Fine, a fintech? That also cuts it. Conclusion As mentioned in the introduction, crypto has earned its position in the fourth industrial revolution. But as things stand, the levels of adoption are still wanting; it is now time for stakeholders to focus on making it easier for the average person to acquire, use and sell crypto assets. After all, the technical infrastructure is already set and can support more user-friendly UI/UX without serious upgrades or modifications. However, the fundamentals of crypto (transparency, decentralization and immutability) ought not to be overlooked in the quest of making it ‘simple’.

As the lines between genuine creativity and mere replication blur, major platforms are stepping up their game. For those deeply embedded in the cryptocurrency and Web3 space, understanding these shifts is paramount, especially as many projects rely heavily on social media for community building and outreach. Recently, Meta, the tech giant behind Facebook and Instagram, made a pivotal announcement that could reshape how Meta content policy impacts your digital presence and outreach strategies. This move signals a strong push towards valuing authentic creation over simple reposting, directly influencing how content is distributed and monetized across its vast network. Understanding Meta’s Stance on Unoriginal Content In a bold move that echoes similar actions by other major platforms, Meta recently unveiled a comprehensive crackdown on what it terms ‘ unoriginal content ’ on Facebook. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a significant policy update designed to re-emphasize the importance of authentic creation and to protect the intellectual property of genuine creators. For too long, the digital space has grappled with the pervasive issue of content theft and unauthorized reuse, leading to a diluted experience for users and diminished returns for those investing time and effort into original work. So, what exactly does Meta categorize as ‘unoriginal content’? At its core, it refers to accounts that consistently reuse someone else’s text, photos, or videos without adding substantial value or transformation. This isn’t about discouraging engagement or community interaction; rather, it targets deliberate, repetitive re-uploading for personal gain without proper attribution or creative input. Meta has been clear that this policy is distinct from activities like: Reaction Videos: Where creators add their unique commentary, analysis, or emotional response to existing content. Joining Trends: Participating in viral challenges or memes, which inherently involve building upon a shared cultural moment. Adding Personal Takes: Offering a new perspective, critique, or creative twist on someone else’s work, transforming it into something new. The focus, instead, is squarely on accounts that simply repost others’ content, often impersonating original creators or operating as spam accounts. This distinction is crucial for content creators who legitimately engage with existing material in transformative ways, ensuring they won’t be unfairly penalized. The goal is to foster an environment where originality is rewarded, and creative effort is recognized, rather than overshadowed by low-effort duplication. Why the Crackdown Now? The Evolution of Digital Content Meta’s announcement didn’t come out of nowhere. It follows closely on the heels of YouTube, which also clarified its policies around repetitive and mass-produced videos. This synchronized action by two of the world’s largest content platforms highlights a growing industry-wide concern: the proliferation of low-quality, repurposed content, often exacerbated by advancements in AI technology. For years, platforms have struggled with content farms and spammers. However, the rise of sophisticated AI tools has made it easier than ever to generate vast quantities of seemingly new, yet fundamentally unoriginal, material. The digital ecosystem has matured to a point where user expectations for quality and authenticity are higher than ever. Users seek genuine connections and valuable information, not an endless stream of recycled posts. Furthermore, advertisers are increasingly discerning, preferring to associate their brands with high-quality, engaging content rather than spam or deceptive practices. By cracking down on unoriginal content , Meta aims to improve the overall user experience, enhance platform integrity, and ensure that advertising revenue flows to legitimate creators who contribute real value. This strategic shift is also about maintaining competitive advantage. In a crowded social media landscape, platforms that prioritize quality and creator well-being are more likely to attract and retain top talent. By protecting original creators and ensuring they receive due credit and views, Meta reinforces its commitment to being a premier destination for digital expression and community building. It’s a proactive measure to safeguard the platform’s long-term health and relevance in an ever-evolving digital world. The Rising Tide of AI Slop and Its Impact One of the most pressing issues driving Meta’s updated policy, even if not explicitly stated in every line, is the alarming rise of “ AI slop .” This term refers to low-quality, often nonsensical or repetitive media content generated using artificial intelligence tools. While AI offers incredible potential for creativity and efficiency, it has also lowered the barrier to entry for mass-producing content that lacks genuine insight, narrative, or human touch. Consider the ease with which AI tools can now generate text, synthesize voices, and even create video clips. It’s become common to find videos on platforms like YouTube featuring AI-generated voices overlaid on a series of stock photos, generic video clips, or even repurposed footage, all stitched together with minimal human intervention. This kind of content, while technically “new” in its composition, often lacks originality in its core message or presentation. It’s designed to game algorithms, not to engage human audiences meaningfully. Meta’s guidance for creating “original content” subtly hints at its awareness of this problem. The company advises creators against merely “stitching together clips” or simply adding their watermark to content from other sources. Instead, it champions “authentic storytelling” and cautions against short videos offering little value. These descriptions perfectly fit the characteristics of much of the AI-generated “slop” that floods platforms: repetitive visual elements, generic narration, and a lack of depth or unique perspective. By discouraging such practices, Meta aims to subtly curb the spread of low-quality AI-generated content, pushing creators towards more thoughtful and human-centric approaches. Furthermore, Meta’s emphasis on high-quality video captions could also be seen as a gentle nudge away from relying solely on automated AI captioning tools that might produce inaccuracies or lack nuance. While AI can assist in content creation, Meta’s updated Meta content policy underscores the need for human oversight, editing, and genuine creative input to ensure content truly resonates and provides value. Consequences and Enforcement: Impact on Facebook Monetization Meta’s crackdown isn’t just about policy statements; it comes with tangible consequences, particularly for Facebook monetization programs. The company has made it clear that accounts repeatedly abusing the system by reusing someone else’s content will face significant penalties. These measures are designed to hit where it hurts most: the ability to earn revenue and reach an audience. The core consequences include: Loss of Monetization Access: Violating accounts will lose access to Facebook monetization programs for a specified period. This means no ad revenue, no Stars, no subscriptions – a direct hit to the financial viability of content farms and spammers. Reduced Distribution: Posts from penalized accounts will see significantly reduced distribution. This means their content will appear less frequently in users’ feeds, dramatically limiting their reach and impact. The goal is to make it economically unfeasible to operate solely on repurposed content. Original Creator Prioritization: When duplicate videos are detected, Facebook will actively reduce the distribution of the copies, ensuring that the original creator receives the views and credit they deserve. This is a crucial step in rebalancing the scales in favor of genuine content producers. Linking to Original Content: Meta is also testing a system that adds direct links on duplicate videos, pointing viewers back to the original source. This not only gives credit where it’s due but also educates users on where to find authentic content, further devaluing the copied versions. These enforcement actions are not new; Meta has already been active in combating malicious behavior. Earlier this year, the company revealed it had taken down approximately 10 million profiles impersonating large content producers and acted against 500,000 accounts engaged in “spammy behavior or fake engagement.” This history demonstrates Meta’s commitment to maintaining platform integrity, and the new policy is a significant escalation of these ongoing efforts. For legitimate content creators , this means a fairer playing field and greater opportunity to stand out. Navigating the New Landscape: Advice for Content Creators For genuine content creators , Meta’s updated policy should be seen as an opportunity rather than a threat. By prioritizing originality, Meta is creating a more equitable environment where authentic voices can thrive. However, it also means creators need to be mindful of best practices to ensure their content aligns with the new guidelines and avoids unintentional penalties. Here are some actionable insights for creators: Focus on Authenticity: This is the cornerstone. Whether it’s your unique perspective, original footage, or distinctive narrative style, prioritize content that genuinely reflects your creativity and effort. Transformative Use: If you use existing content, ensure your contribution is transformative. Adding significant commentary, unique editing, parody, or a new context elevates it beyond mere reuse. Think “remix” rather than “repost.” Understand the Nuances of AI: While AI tools can be powerful assistants, avoid letting them dictate your entire content strategy. Use AI to enhance, not replace, your originality. Always review and edit AI-generated elements to ensure quality and unique value. High-Quality Captions and Descriptions: Meta explicitly mentioned the importance of high-quality video captions. This implies moving beyond basic automated captions to ensure accuracy, context, and perhaps even a unique voice in your text elements. Monitor Your Professional Dashboard: Meta is rolling out new post-level insights in Facebook’s Professional Dashboard. Creators can use this to understand why their content might not be distributing as expected. This dashboard will also indicate if an account is at risk of content recommendation or monetization penalties, providing early warnings. Stay Informed: Policies evolve. Regularly check Meta’s official creator resources and policy updates to stay ahead of any changes. These changes will roll out gradually over the coming months, giving creators time to adjust their strategies. The new transparency tools in the Professional Dashboard are a welcome addition, empowering creators to understand their performance and compliance status more clearly. This proactive approach by Meta aims to support creators who genuinely contribute to the platform’s vibrancy, while simultaneously weeding out those who exploit it. Meta’s Enforcement Challenges and the Road Ahead While Meta’s intent to crack down on unoriginal content is commendable, the company faces a significant challenge: the accurate and fair enforcement of these policies, particularly through automated means. The article touches upon existing criticism from users, including on Instagram, regarding erroneous and over-enforcement of policies, leading to wrongfully disabled accounts and a perceived lack of human support. A petition with nearly 30,000 signatures highlights this frustration, underscoring the feeling of abandonment among many small businesses and creators who rely on Meta’s platforms. This tension between automated efficiency and human nuance is a perpetual struggle for large-scale content platforms. While AI and algorithms are essential for moderating billions of pieces of content, they can sometimes lack the context or understanding required to differentiate between genuine transformative use and simple reposting. The risk is that legitimate creators might be caught in the crossfire, facing unwarranted penalties and a frustrating lack of recourse due to limited human support. Meta has yet to publicly address these specific criticisms about automated enforcement errors, despite attention from the press and high-profile creators. This silence is a point of concern for many in the creator community. The success of this new Meta content policy will ultimately hinge not just on its stated goals, but on the fairness and accuracy of its implementation. Creators will be watching closely to see if Meta can strike the right balance between robust enforcement and providing adequate support for those who are genuinely trying to create original, valuable content. The broader trend across major platforms, including YouTube’s parallel efforts, indicates a collective industry push towards a more curated, quality-driven digital content ecosystem. As AI technology continues to advance, the challenge of discerning authentic creativity from sophisticated replication will only grow. Meta’s latest move is a critical step in this ongoing battle, aiming to foster an environment where true innovation and valuable contributions are recognized and rewarded, ultimately benefiting both users and ethical content creators alike. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Originality Meta’s decisive action to curb unoriginal content marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of social media. By aligning its policies with those of other industry leaders like YouTube, Meta is signaling a clear commitment to fostering a healthier, more authentic digital environment. This crackdown is not merely about penalizing rule-breakers; it’s fundamentally about protecting and empowering genuine content creators , ensuring that their efforts are recognized, rewarded, and reach the audiences they deserve. For those engaged in the vibrant world of crypto and Web3, where community and original thought are paramount, these changes underscore the importance of building truly unique and valuable content strategies. While challenges in automated enforcement persist, the overall direction points towards a future where originality reigns supreme, paving the way for more meaningful interactions and sustainable Facebook monetization for creators who truly innovate.

The new geofence size more than doubled the service area for the Tesla Robotaxi in only 22 days, and it is larger than Waymo’s by at least 4 square miles. The official Tesla Robotaxi X account left little to the imagination of fans when it posted the updated geofence map with the caption “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger.” Robotaxi also claimed to be big fans of eggplants, adding that they had just expanded their surface area. Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, added fuel to the naughty online conversation by retweeting Teslaconomics’ post with the caption “Bigger, longer, uncut,” followed by a laughing emoji. Musk announced the expansion of Austin’s geofence for the Robotaxi service last week, adding that Tesla was looking to launch the service in the Bay Area in a few weeks. TSLA retail investor Steve Ryan suggested the new geofence map’s phallic shape as a joke, and in true Musk fashion, he made Tesla do it, pissing off critics and making fans laugh. Robotaxi’s new app version rolls out I just opened the Tesla Robotaxi app and the geofenced area in Austin, Texas has officially expanded 🤣 pic.twitter.com/gDOzLvkH4g — Teslaconomics (@Teslaconomics) July 14, 2025 Robotaxi’s new app version was rolled out on July 14, adding walking directions for pickup and drop-off flexibility. According to the Robotaxi team, the addition of notable landmarks made navigating ride-sharing pickups and destinations in large metros and congested areas in Austin easier. The updated app now guides users to Robotaxi pickup and drop-off locations that are not close to specific areas being visited. The Robotaxi app also includes closing times for different drop-off destinations to reduce inconveniences. The new feature warns users when visiting establishments about to close, guiding users to establishments with enough time to serve their needs. It also includes the ability to edit users’ pickup locations and destinations even after booking rides, instead of fixed default spots. Tesla also included the University of Texas in the service area coverage to expand the service to over 53K students. Musk’s un-billionaire-like juvenile humor, like his fixation on the marijuana-related number 420, will likely attract more students to the service’s rides priced at $4.20. The controversial billionaire investor smoked a joint in 2018 during a live podcast on “The Joe Rogan Experience.” He later posted a meme with the caption “Twitter’s next board meeting is gonna be lit.” Robotaxi users get more tips Tesla’s updated Robotaxi app allows users to select their preferred cabin temperature and provides more smart tips while waiting for rides. The tips include how to operate the Model Y door handles and how the driverless vehicles’ light signals work. More smart suggestions include destinations like parks, cafes, shopping centers, restaurants, and other key locations. Additionally, the simple interface provides real-time updates on the arrival of their Robotaxis to help users better understand their shared ride experiences. However, customers can still not leave tips for good service. Tesla is also laying the groundwork for future expansions, and validation vehicles have been seen in Kyle, Texas. According to the company, its engineering and validation teams continuously work on new expansions as the public receives more updated rollouts. However, even after expanding its service area, Tesla has not officially shared details about increasing its fleet. The electric carmakers previously claimed they had shortened the time to new deployments by streamlining the process. Tesla now ships new vehicles from the factory, installs the Robotaxi software, and places ready cars on public streets much faster. Waymo’s long mapping processes are yet to give the Robotaxi’s quick expansions any real competition.

Notably, XRP has broken through key resistance zones in recent sessions, aligning with the broader market rally fueled by Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) new record high above $123,000. The surge saw XRP briefly touch $3 before retracing to $2.86 at press time. That price marks a 3.5% drop over the past 24 hours, though the asset remains up 26% on the week. XRP one-week price chart. Source: Finbold For its price forecast, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s ChatGPT , which offered several scenarios for XRP. ChatGPT predicts XRP price ChatGPT, analyzing technical patterns and market sentiment, predicts that XRP will trade between $2.95 and $3.15 by August 1. Its single-point prediction puts the token at $3.08, an 8% increase from current levels. The AI model noted that XRP has already broken past key resistance near $2.50 and is now consolidating just below the psychologically important $3 mark, a setup that is often bullish in the short term. However, the model cautioned that resistance between $3 and $3.10 remains strong and may be hard to break without a major catalyst. To this end, XRP’s history suggests 5% to 15% moves when consolidating near resistance. Still, the current market environment, described as “greedy but not euphoric”, might support moderate gains rather than explosive rallies. AI price reduction for XRP. Source: ChatGPT Grok predicts XRP price On the other hand, Grok, another AI model, also predicts further upside for XRP, with a target slightly higher at $3.10 by August 1. Its estimate factors in continued bullish momentum, improved regulatory clarity, and strong trading volume. Grok also sees the potential for XRP to test $3.20, though it warned of a possible dip to $2.90 if overbought conditions trigger a pullback. Ultimately, XRP’s ability to hit the expected $3 level will depend on how Bitcoin performs, as the asset has closely mirrored the leading cryptocurrency’s trading patterns. At the same time, if profit-taking accelerates in the coming days, XRP risks losing its $2.50 support, making it harder to reclaim the $3 mark.

The world of finance is rapidly evolving, and crypto exchange Gemini is at the forefront of this transformation. In a groundbreaking move, Gemini has recently unveiled a new suite of Gemini tokenized stocks , specifically designed to empower EU investors with unprecedented access to high-profile U.S. equities. What Are Gemini Tokenized Stocks and Why Do They Matter? Imagine owning a piece of global giants like Nike, McDonald’s, or Starbucks, but with the flexibility and efficiency of blockchain technology. That’s precisely what Gemini tokenized stocks offer. These aren’t just speculative digital tokens; each one is meticulously backed 1:1 by actual, real-world shares of the underlying U.S. company. This innovative approach allows investors to gain exposure to leading American brands like Nike (NKE), McDonald’s (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), Coca-Cola (KO), and Yum! Brands (YUM) without the complexities often associated with cross-border traditional stock trading. The beauty of Gemini tokenized stocks lies in their ability to democratize access, breaking down geographical and financial barriers. Key Features of Tokenized Stocks: 1:1 Backing: Every token issued by Gemini is directly backed by one real share held by a regulated broker-dealer, Dinari. This ensures transparency and asset security. Fractional Ownership: You don’t need to buy an entire share. Tokenization allows you to invest in a fraction of a share, making high-priced stocks more accessible to a wider range of investors. Increased Accessibility: This initiative provides a streamlined pathway for investors in the EU to access U.S. equity markets, which might otherwise be cumbersome due to jurisdictional differences. Potential for Extended Trading Hours: While traditional markets operate during specific hours, tokenized assets on a blockchain could potentially facilitate trading around the clock, offering greater flexibility. Expanding Horizons: Opportunities for EU Investors For EU investors , this launch signifies a substantial leap forward. Historically, gaining direct exposure to the robust U.S. stock market could be cumbersome, involving multiple intermediaries, significant fees, and often, a fragmented regulatory landscape. Gemini’s new offering streamlines this process, providing a seamless gateway to some of the world’s most recognized and valuable companies. This innovation addresses several pain points traditionally faced by EU investors : Feature Traditional Stock Investing (EU to US) Tokenized Stocks via Gemini Access Complexity Often complex, limited brokers, cross-border paperwork Simplified, direct access via Gemini platform Fees & Costs Higher foreign exchange (FX) conversion fees, various transaction charges Potentially lower, more transparent fee structures Fractional Ownership Rare or limited for individual investors Standard feature, enabling smaller investments Trading Hours Limited to U.S. stock market hours (EST) Potentially 24/7 trading (platform dependent), offering greater flexibility Settlement Time Typically T+2 or T+3 (2-3 business days) Near-instant settlement on the blockchain, improving liquidity This direct and efficient access empowers EU investors to diversify their portfolios more effectively, spreading risk and tapping into growth opportunities previously out of reach. The Power of Blockchain: How Tokenized U.S. Stocks Leverage Arbitrum Blockchain The technological backbone supporting these groundbreaking tokenized U.S. stocks is the Arbitrum blockchain . Arbitrum, a prominent Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, is renowned for its ability to process transactions much faster and at a significantly lower cost than the main Ethereum network. This makes it an ideal choice for facilitating the efficient issuance and trading of tokenized assets. Why Arbitrum? Speed: Arbitrum offers rapid transaction finality, meaning your trades are processed and confirmed quickly. Cost-Efficiency: By bundling multiple transactions off-chain, Arbitrum significantly reduces gas fees, making trading more economical. Scalability: It can handle a high volume of transactions, ensuring the platform remains responsive even during peak demand. Security: As a Layer 2 solution, Arbitrum inherits the robust security features of the underlying Ethereum blockchain, providing a secure environment for your investments. Gemini’s collaboration with broker-dealer Dinari is crucial here, ensuring that each token is legally and operationally backed by the real-world shares. This partnership bridges the gap between traditional financial markets and the burgeoning world of decentralized finance, creating a robust and compliant framework for these tokenized U.S. stocks . Navigating the Future of Digital Assets with Gemini The launch of tokenized stocks by Gemini is a testament to the growing convergence of traditional finance and blockchain technology, signaling a maturing landscape for digital assets . As more real-world assets find their digital counterparts, investors are presented with an ever-expanding universe of opportunities. For investors considering these new opportunities in digital assets , it’s essential to keep a few considerations in mind: Understand the Regulatory Landscape: While Gemini operates within a regulated framework, it’s always wise for investors to be aware of their local regulations regarding tokenized assets. Liquidity: While the market for tokenized stocks is growing, it may differ from the liquidity found in traditional, high-volume stock exchanges. Security Practices: Always use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your Gemini account to protect your investments. Education: Take the time to understand how tokenized assets work, their benefits, and any associated risks. Gemini, known for its commitment to regulation and security, aims to provide a trusted environment for exploring these new frontiers in digital assets . This initiative not only expands investment choices but also pushes the boundaries of what’s possible in a globally interconnected financial system. Conclusion Gemini’s introduction of tokenized U.S. stocks for EU investors marks a significant milestone in the evolution of financial markets. By leveraging the power of the Arbitrum blockchain and partnering with Dinari, Gemini is democratizing access to high-value U.S. equities, offering EU investors a streamlined, efficient, and innovative way to diversify their portfolios. This move underscores the immense potential of tokenization to reshape how we invest, making global markets more accessible and liquid than ever before. As the line between traditional and digital assets and traditional finance continues to blur, opportunities for savvy investors are only set to expand.

Market watchers are closely tracking its repeated retests of the $3 level, with a strong bullish order book forming just above and below this psychological barrier. The excitement is clear, both in trading behavior and among analysts. The XRP Demand Surge One such analyst is Dark Defender (@DefendDark), who posted a snapshot of XRP’s active order book and a sharp upward trend on the chart. The image, which shows buy walls building rapidly as sell orders thin out, reflects intense real-time demand. “Salute to the ones who positioned themselves much in advance!” he said, complimenting long-time holders now seeing the impact of their strategy. At the time of his analysis, the asset traded at $3.0178, with visible market interest both above and below that figure. Demand for #XRP is exploding! Salute to the ones who positioned themselves much in advance! Crazy #XRPArmy pic.twitter.com/9T8Eb5pGq0 — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) July 14, 2025 Critical Price Level Retested XRP has repeatedly pushed back to $3, a level that has held it back since it dropped below it in early February . Several prominent traders believe this setup could pave the way for a potential new all-time high, with one analyst recently highlighting $3 as the neckline for a cup-and-handle pattern . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The positive sentiment surrounding XRP is gaining traction, especially as technical indicators suggest a build-up of bullish pressure. The RSI displayed in the image, while climbing, still shows room before entering extreme overbought territory, suggesting further upside remains plausible. Order Book Signals Institutional Interest The liquidity snapshot shared by Dark Defender shows significantly higher green buy orders stacked in the $3.0160–$3.0180 range, while sell pressure appears thin until after $3.0195. More than 74% of current order flow is weighted toward buys and only 26% toward sells, showing the strength of demand. This order imbalance is driving confidence among short-term traders who are now betting on XRP maintaining its momentum. Looking Ahead XRP’s current rally is not happening in isolation. Regulatory clarity and increasing integration of Ripple’s payment solutions globally have helped restore interest in the asset. However, the technical and psychological breakthrough of the $3 mark, which has proven elusive for months, may now mark the beginning of a new phase, and those who got in early will benefit the most.

Bitcoin: Bull Market Pullback Underway The bitcoin (BTC) market rally has stalled in the past 24 hours as expected , but instead of consolidation, prices have pulled back over 5% to $116,800 from record highs in a move typical of a bull market pullback. Reports suggest that profit-taking by long-term holders is weighing on the cryptocurrency's price. It's common for markets to revisit breakout points, in this case, the May 22 high of around $111,960, and test the underlying buying interest before chalking out bigger rallies. A similar dynamic played out earlier this year as prices dropped from over $100,000 of $75,000, revisiting the breakout point from late 2024. From a technical analysis perspective, the broader bullish bias will prevail while prices remain locked in the ascending channel on the daily chart. Over the next 24 hours, the focus will be on the hourly chart, which shows a steep corrective trend lower, with prices trading below the Ichimoku cloud to suggest bearish momentum. However, the RSI on the hourly chart has dropped below 30, indicating an oversold condition – a stark contrast to the above-70 or overbought reading seen a day ago. So, a bounce cannot be ruled out. The probability of a pullback to $111,960 would weaken if the potential recovery ends the downward-trending channel. Such a move will likely result in fresh record highs. Volatility could remain high as cumulative open interest in onshore and offshore futures and offshore perpetual futures has increased to 734.82K BTC, which is just shy of the record 744K BTC in October 2022, according to data source CoinGecko. The growth in open interest is likely being led by offshore exchanges as the number of active contracts on the CME remains below the May high, with the three-month annualized basis still below 10%. Conversely, annualized funding rates on offshore perpetuals have topped 11%, indicating a growing demand for the bullish exposure. AI's take: Bitcoin's 5% pullback is a healthy bull market feature, aiming to retest the key breakout level of $111,960 before potentially initiating a stronger rally. Resistance: $118,000-118,500, $120,000, $123,181 Support: $113,688 (the 38.2% Fib retracement of the rally from June 22 lows), $111,965, $107,823 (the 61.8% Fib) XRP: Holds 100-hour MA and cloud support XRP (XRP) has dropped from $3 and appears to be trapped in a downward-trending channel on the hourly chart, mirroring BTC. Still, XRP appears relatively better off, holding the confluence of the 100-hour simple moving average (SMA) and the Ichimoku cloud at $2.81. A breakout from here would imply an end to the correction and resumption of the broader uptrend toward the yearly peak of $3.4. On the way higher, bulls will likely be tested again at around $3. Watch out for the move below the Ichimoku cloud, as that would strengthen the immediate bear case, shifting focus to the 200-hour SMA at $2.6. Again, volatility could be elevated with perpetual futures open interest hitting a record high of 2.74 billion XRP, according to Coinglass. The annualized XRP funding rates hover at 15%, indicating a growing bias for leveraged bullish plays. AI's take: Despite XRP's hourly chart showing a BTC-mirroring downtrend from $3, its strong hold above the 100-hour SMA and Ichimoku cloud at $2.81 signals underlying support. Record perpetual futures open interest and high funding rates indicate significant leveraged bullish demand, making a breakout above $3, towards $3.4, likely if current support holds. Resistance: $3, $3.4 Support: $2.81, $2.6-$2.65, $2.38 ETH: Awaiting breakout Ether (ETH) remains trapped in an expanding triangle, with the daily stochastic flashing an overbought reading, pointing to stretched upward momentum, which weakens the case for a firm breakout in the short term. A consolidation around the resistance looks likely as prices are firmly above the Ichimoku cloud on the daily chart and short-term SMAs point north, indicating a bullish bias. An eventual breakout would shift focus to $3,400, a level targeted by options traders. AI's take: The daily stochastic being overbought indicates that momentum is stretched, making a convincing push above the upper trendline unlikely in the short term. Resistance: $3,067 (the 61.8% Fib retracement), $3,500, $3,570, $4,000. Support: $2,905, $2,880, $2,739, $2,600 SOL: $168 is the new resistance level SOL's upside remains elusive despite the dual breakout on the daily chart. Since Friday, the bulls have failed at least twice to chew through bearish pressures at around $168, as evidenced by the long upper wicks attached to the candles for Monday and Friday. So, a break above $168 is now needed to confirm bullishness. On the downside, $157 is the level to watch as it marks the neckline support of the double top pattern on the hourly chart. A breakdown of the support line would imply potential for a deeper decline to $146, per the measured move method. AI's take : Traders should watch for a definitive break above $168 to confirm bullish continuation; otherwise, a loss of the $157 neckline support could trigger a deeper decline towards $146. Resistance : $168, $180-$190, $200. Support : $157, $145, $125.",Markets|market analysis|Bitcoin|XRP|open interest|Solana|Ether|News,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BTC|XRP|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-15 09:24:14

The Dogecoin price surged past $0.20, then decreased to the $0.18–$0.19 range. Derivatives volume remains strong, but momentum looks tired Meanwhile, a $0.08 token, Remittix (RTX) , is stealing the spotlight with a forecasted ROI of 5,880% for early backers. DOGE Price Holds But Technical Signals Soften Dogecoin price is currently around $0.19 after failing to remain above $0.20. A bullish break happened over July 9–10, pushing DOGE to $0.186, but it stalled there. Source: TradingView On longer timeframes, key indicators like MACD and RSI remain positive. But resistance at $0.20–$0.21 is proving tough to crack. Dogecoin news updates flag a stalled rally, with bulls losing grip below $0.20. Analysts note that support around $0.18–$0.19 holds critical importance. Can DOGE Still Rally? Traders see a path back up if DOGE can retake $0.20 with volume. If Dogecoin slips below the $0.18 mark, it might dip further to around $0.16 or even $0.17. But it’s not all bearish. Some analysts believe DOGE could hit $0.22 soon. However, the longer-term price prediction is positive. But as Dogecoin price remains range-bound, attention is shifting to tokens with clearer, functional appeal. Remittix Stuns as the New Crypto Delight Remittix (RTX) is hitting headlines with big claims: buy RTX token prospects, 5,880% ROI forecasts, and a working platform for real-world use. Whales are loading up. Here’s why it matters: Global reach: Send crypto directly to bank accounts in 30+ countries Real-world utility: Built for actual use, not just memes Audited by CertiK: Designed with trust and transparency $16M+ raised, with momentum building fast $250,000 Remittix Giveaway: an exclusive opportunity for presale investors Remittix is a crypto with real utility, not just another meme coin. As bulls cool off on DOGE, boost in crypto staking, and DeFi, Remittix offers a steady utility alternative people can actually use. Why Remittix Should Be Your Next Investment Move Dogecoin price is cooling after a strong spike. It still has room to run, but the path to $0.30+ depends on momentum and macro support. Meanwhile, Dogecoin news is making room for tokens like RTX, designed for payments and real adjustments in the remittance landscape.

Ripple CTO Weighs In After Price Jump,https://coinedition.com/ripple-cto-xrp-rally-utility-vs-price-comparison/,"David Schwartz says that XRP price will correlate with its utility value in the long term despite the headwinds in the short term. Ripple CTO believes the adoption of XRP as a wrapped version on other chains is crucial for its long-term growth. XRP price is on the cusp of entering its euphoric phase of the 2025 altseason. Ripple Labs’ chief technology officer (CTO) David Schwartz has welcomed the recent crypto pump- led by Ethereum (ETH) and XRP. Schwartz noted that he is of the view that bull markets are vital to reward investors. However, Schwartz highlighted that most altcoins continue to record lower prices in the short term, which is not a true representation of the underlying utility. According to Schwartz, crypto prices will eventually catch up with their respective real-world utility, especially in the long haul. Nonetheless, he noted that the set of actual real-world problems being solved by crypto assets is considerably small. “I always feel good when prices are high because I hate to think that people are losing money. But I’m truly not sure how much focus on price is the right amount, especially since price doesn’t seem to correlate very mu… The post Is XRP Still Undervalued?

Not only have the shorts been dominating the market recently, but the exponential growth has seen the short positions rise to levels never before seen in the history of the digital asset. While this might look bearish at a glance as it means traders expect the price to decline, it could actually end up being ultra-bullish for the altcoin. Ethereum Leverage Positions Reach Record Short Levels In a post on X, market expert Zerohedge revealed an interesting development for Ethereum, and that is the fact that Ethereum shorts have now reached new records. The chart showed the Ether leveraged net totals, and it came out to a -13291, beating the previous high that was set back in May at -12000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Not Stopping At $123,000 — Technical Indicators Point To $140,000 Top This rise in Ethereum shorts proves that there is still a lot of disbelief in the current market rally, and many traders expect the Ethereum price to fall again. However, looking at the historical performance when it comes to shorts reaching record levels, it shows a trend that this could mean the rally could be sustained. For example, back in May 2025, when it set its previous peak of -12000, the Ethereum price had rallied from below $1,800 to above $2,600 before the month was over. This trend is also playing out now as the Ethereum price has crossed $3,000, as the Ether shorts have reached a new peak. How To Stay Positioned For ETH Given that the Ethereum price seems to be headed into what might be a parabolic rally after clearing $3,000, crypto analyst Luca on X has outlined how they intend to position for the surge. Luca explains that with the new week, the Ethereum price is at a key point. This is because it is approaching the 0.618 Fibonacci Retracement level, and this level is important because it has been a point of consolidation for the altcoin in the past. Related Reading: Prepare For ATHs: ‘XRP Train Has Left The Station – Analyst As such, the analyst explains that he intends to keep holding his positions on Ethereum. So far, Luca revealed that he has only de-risked Bitcoin positions as the pioneer cryptocurrency has hit all-time highs, but as the end of the cycle draws closer, the focus remains on altcoins. He maintains that the Ethereum price, alongside altcoins, will end up outperforming Bitcoin once the dominance drops. When this dominance drop happens, the analyst says that is when to begin de-risking altcoin positions. For now, though, the analyst expects Ethereum and altcoins to keep trailing Bitcoin as the dominance still remains high above 64% and BTC is yet to enter its distribution phase.

Recent reports from the Korean Intellectual Property Rights Information Service (KIPRIS) reveal that Hippo Protocol has filed a trademark application for “KRWHP.” This move strongly suggests the protocol is laying the groundwork for a KRW stablecoin – a digital asset pegged to the value of the South Korean Won. What does this mean for the crypto community, and why is this development so important for blockchain innovation Korea ? Hippo Protocol’s Vision: Pioneering a KRW Stablecoin Hippo Protocol’s potential venture into the stablecoin arena marks a pivotal moment for the project and the broader South Korean market. While many stablecoins are pegged to the US Dollar, a KRW stablecoin would offer unique advantages for users within South Korea, minimizing foreign exchange risks and facilitating smoother transactions in local currency. This strategic move aligns with the growing demand for localized digital assets that can seamlessly integrate with national economies. The filing of the “KRWHP” trademark application is more than just a formality; it signals a serious commitment from Hippo Protocol to establish a robust and compliant stablecoin. This proactive approach indicates a deep understanding of the regulatory landscape and the necessity of legal groundwork before launching such a significant financial product. For a market as dynamic and technologically advanced as South Korea’s, a native stablecoin could unlock new avenues for decentralized finance (DeFi), cross-border payments, and everyday digital transactions. Understanding the Power of a South Korean Won Stablecoin What exactly is a stablecoin, and why would a South Korean won stablecoin be so impactful? At its core, a stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically by being pegged to a fiat currency like the US Dollar or, in this case, the South Korean Won. This stability makes them ideal for various purposes, from acting as a safe haven during crypto market volatility to facilitating quick and cost-effective transfers. Here’s why a KRW-pegged stablecoin could be a game-changer: Reduced Volatility: Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, a stablecoin offers price predictability, making it suitable for payments, savings, and lending. Local Market Integration: For South Korean users, a KRW stablecoin eliminates the need to convert to USD-pegged stablecoins, simplifying transactions and reducing conversion fees. Enhanced Liquidity: It could provide a highly liquid on-ramp and off-ramp between the traditional financial system and the crypto ecosystem within South Korea. DeFi Opportunities: A stable and widely adopted KRW stablecoin could fuel the growth of KRW-denominated DeFi protocols, offering new lending, borrowing, and yield farming opportunities. The emergence of a reliable South Korean won stablecoin could bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital economy, fostering greater trust and adoption among mainstream users and institutions. The Korean Crypto Landscape and Future Blockchain Innovation South Korea stands as a global leader in cryptocurrency adoption and technological advancement. With a highly tech-savvy population and a strong appetite for digital innovation, the country has consistently been at the forefront of crypto trends. However, its regulatory environment, while evolving, has also been quite stringent, emphasizing investor protection and market stability. This makes Hippo Protocol’s move particularly noteworthy. The potential introduction of a regulated KRW stablecoin could significantly impact the domestic crypto exchanges and financial institutions. It could provide a compliant and efficient digital medium for transactions, potentially reducing reliance on traditional banking rails for crypto-related activities. This aligns with the broader global trend of central banks exploring digital currencies (CBDCs) and private entities developing stablecoins that adhere to national regulations. The success of such a stablecoin would not only benefit Hippo Protocol but also serve as a blueprint for further blockchain innovation Korea . It could encourage other projects to explore localized digital assets, fostering a more robust and diverse crypto ecosystem that caters specifically to the needs of the Korean market. Navigating Challenges and Unlocking Opportunities in Stablecoin Development While the prospect of a KRWHP stablecoin is exciting, the path to successful stablecoin development is often fraught with challenges. Regulatory clarity remains a primary concern globally, and South Korea is no exception. Ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations, maintaining adequate reserves, and achieving widespread adoption are critical hurdles to overcome. Key Challenges: Regulatory Compliance: Navigating South Korea’s strict financial regulations and obtaining necessary licenses will be paramount. Reserve Management: Maintaining full backing with transparent audits to ensure the stablecoin’s peg remains robust. Adoption and Liquidity: Convincing users and businesses to adopt KRWHP will require strong partnerships and compelling use cases. Competition: While a native KRW stablecoin has an advantage, it will still face competition from other stablecoins and traditional payment methods. Despite these challenges, the opportunities for a well-executed stablecoin development project like KRWHP are immense. It could open doors for: New Payment Solutions: Faster, cheaper cross-border remittances and domestic payments. Digital Asset Trading: Providing a stable base pair for trading other cryptocurrencies on Korean exchanges. Financial Inclusion: Potentially offering financial services to underbanked populations within the digital realm. Global Expansion: If successful domestically, it could serve as a model for other national currency-pegged stablecoins globally. What’s Next for Hippo Protocol and the Market? The trademark application is merely the first visible step in what will likely be a comprehensive process for Hippo Protocol . The next phases will undoubtedly involve engaging with regulators, developing the underlying technical infrastructure, and building partnerships within the Korean financial and crypto sectors. The successful launch of KRWHP could set a new precedent for how national currencies interact with blockchain technology. For investors and enthusiasts, closely monitoring Hippo Protocol’s progress will be crucial. The success of KRWHP could significantly boost the utility and value proposition of the broader Hippo Protocol ecosystem. It also highlights a growing trend in the crypto space: the move towards localized, fiat-backed stablecoins that cater to specific national markets, fostering deeper integration between traditional finance and decentralized technology. Conclusion: A New Era for Korean Crypto? Hippo Protocol’s trademark application for “KRWHP” is a powerful signal of its ambition to launch a KRW stablecoin . This development has the potential to profoundly impact the South Korean crypto market, offering a stable, regulated, and efficient digital asset pegged to the national currency. As stablecoin development continues to evolve globally, Hippo Protocol’s pioneering move could pave the way for a new era of localized digital finance and further solidify South Korea’s position at the forefront of blockchain innovation Korea . The journey ahead will require careful navigation of regulatory complexities and robust technological implementation, but the potential rewards for users and the broader ecosystem are substantial.

XRP rises 25% as ETF launch and crypto legislation align, fueling trading interest this week. ProShares Ultra XRP ETF Approved for NYSE Arca Listing The US Securities and Exchange Commission has approved the listing of the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF on NYSE Arca. According to a filing dated July 14, the leveraged futures-based fund will trade under the ticker UXRP. Trading is expected to begin by the end of this week. The ETF has also been added to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) eligibility list, a key step before trading. While a product page is already live, the fund was not yet trading at the time of publication. Meanwhile, ProShares Ultra XRP ETF aims to deliver 2x the daily performance of an XRP index. Rather than owning the token directly, the fund intermediates it through derivative products: futures contracts and swap agreements. This enables investors to gain leverage on the price of XRP daily without necessarily possessing the asset. The fund’s leveraged structure is intended for short-term trading and may not be suitable for long-term holders. Its launch marks the first such XRP-linked product approved for public trading in the United States. Two More XRP ETFs Await Clearance The company also disclosed plans to launch two additional XRP-related ETFs. These include the Short XRP ETF (XRPS), which seeks -1x daily performance, and the UltraShort XRP ETF (RIPS), targeting -2x exposure. Both funds aim to deliver inverse returns of XRP’s daily price movement. As of now, neither of the inverse ETFs has appeared on the DTCC eligibility list. Their launch remains pending until they receive operational clearance. According to a recent amendment filed on July 11, the company has set July 18 as the tentative launch date for all three funds. ETF Launch Coincides with Crypto Week Legislation The launch of the ProShares XRP ETFs may align with Crypto Week in Washington, D.C., where lawmakers are reviewing new crypto-related legislation. Consequently, the timing could boost attention around XRP-related financial products, especially as industry watchers monitor developments around the Clarity Act and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. XRP price has gained around 25% over the past week amid increased speculation and institutional activity.

Reports on Feasibility Commissioned by Central State Actors The guideline is focused on fintech innovation-oriented digital service firms and financial institutions, including Shanghai Data Group and Guotai Haitong. They are instructed to study the means of stablecoin issuance on the yuan basis as well as consider starting pilot programs. The move follows a meeting last week by the Shanghai State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), where Director He Qing stressed the need for state firms to embrace digital transformation and innovation of financial infrastructure. China’s latest actions may signal a softening of its hard-line history stance toward digital tokens. Government officials are now urging state-owned firms to research how blockchain can assist in creating sectors like cross-border payments, supply chain lending, and asset tokenization. He Qing stated, “State-owned assets and state-owned companies will play a bigger role in scientific and technological innovation, adjustment of industrial mix, and security support.” Global Stablecoin Pressure This step follows as there is mounting pressure from global events in stablecoin adoption and regulation. On July 10, Chinese regulators convened to rethink their positions following the rapid growth of stablecoin use across the world. The Senate has already approved the drafted GENIUS Act in the United States and awaits a vote in the House. Hong Kong is to enact the Stablecoin Ordinance on August 1, which will bring in a licensing regime for HKD-backed stablecoins. The EU had prior to that applied its MiCA structure to govern issuers of stablecoins within the bloc. China’s Next Digital Currency Move?

If so, understanding the ebb and flow between Bitcoin and altcoins is absolutely crucial for making informed decisions. The cryptocurrency landscape is a dynamic arena, often characterized by distinct periods where one asset class outshines the other. Currently, a key metric, the Altcoin Season Index , is signaling a clear trend: we are firmly in a Bitcoin Season . But what exactly does this mean for your portfolio and future investments? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: Your Market Compass The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool, tracked by prominent cryptocurrency price data platforms like CoinMarketCap (CMC). It offers a snapshot of market sentiment and asset performance by comparing how the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have fared against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. This index isn’t just a random number; it’s a barometer for understanding which segment of the market is currently leading the charge. Let’s break down how the index works: Index Range: The score ranges from 1 to 100. Altcoin Season Criteria: For the market to be considered in ‘Altcoin Season,’ at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the specified 90-day period. This is when altcoins typically see significant gains and often capture more investor attention. Bitcoin Season Criteria: Conversely, ‘Bitcoin Season’ occurs when 25% or fewer of these top altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. This indicates that capital is largely flowing into Bitcoin, or Bitcoin is holding its value better during market downturns. Current Snapshot: Why the Index Stands at 31 and Signals Bitcoin Season As of 00:30 UTC on July 15, the Altcoin Season Index registered a score of 31. This figure, unchanged from the previous day, clearly indicates that the market is presently in a pronounced Bitcoin Season . A score of 31 is significantly below the 75 threshold required for altcoin dominance, suggesting that a vast majority of altcoins have not managed to outperform Bitcoin over the last three months. What drives such a shift? Several factors can contribute to Bitcoin’s outperformance: Flight to Safety: During periods of uncertainty or volatility in the broader financial markets, investors often view Bitcoin as a relatively safer asset compared to the more volatile altcoins. Institutional Interest: Growing institutional adoption and large-scale investments often flow into Bitcoin first, given its liquidity and established position. Halving Cycles: Anticipation or post-halving effects can draw significant attention and capital into Bitcoin, as its supply issuance decreases. Dominance Cycle: Bitcoin typically leads bull runs, with altcoins catching up later. A strong Bitcoin Season can be a precursor to a future altcoin rally, but it signifies a current period of Bitcoin strength. Understanding this current market phase is vital for strategizing your next moves in the crypto market . Navigating the Crypto Market: Implications for Your Altcoin Performance So, what does a score of 31 on the Altcoin Season Index mean for your altcoin performance and overall investment strategy? It suggests that, for now, capital is consolidating around Bitcoin. This doesn’t mean altcoins are worthless, but rather that they might be experiencing less significant gains, or even corrections, while Bitcoin either holds strong or makes notable advances. During Bitcoin Season, investors often observe: Lower Altcoin Volatility (Potentially): While altcoins are inherently volatile, their price movements might be more subdued compared to Bitcoin’s gains, or they might experience steeper percentage drops during corrections. Bitcoin Dominance Increase: The percentage of the total crypto market capitalization held by Bitcoin tends to rise. Focus on Foundational Projects: Investors might shift focus to established, larger-cap altcoins with strong fundamentals, rather than highly speculative smaller projects. This period can be challenging for those heavily invested in smaller altcoins hoping for quick returns. It emphasizes the importance of a well-diversified portfolio and a long-term perspective. Forecasting Cryptocurrency Trends: What Comes Next? While the current data points to a clear Bitcoin Season , the cryptocurrency market is cyclical. History suggests that a prolonged period of Bitcoin dominance often sets the stage for a subsequent Altcoin Season . But how do we anticipate these shifts in cryptocurrency trends ? Key indicators and factors to watch for a potential shift: Bitcoin Consolidation: After a strong rally, Bitcoin might enter a period of consolidation, trading sideways. This often allows capital to flow into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. New Narratives and Innovations: The emergence of groundbreaking technologies or strong narratives within the altcoin space (e.g., new DeFi protocols, successful Layer-2 solutions, major gaming projects) can ignite investor interest. Reduced Bitcoin Dominance: A sustained decline in Bitcoin’s market dominance, even if Bitcoin’s price is stable, can signal capital moving into altcoins. Macroeconomic Stability: A more stable global economic environment can encourage investors to take on more risk, flowing into higher-beta assets like altcoins. It’s crucial to remember that the Altcoin Season Index is a lagging indicator. It tells us what has happened, not what will happen. Therefore, while it confirms the current state, active monitoring of market sentiment and fundamental developments is key for anticipating future shifts. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor Navigating the current Bitcoin Season requires a thoughtful approach. Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: Assess your current asset allocation. If you’re heavily weighted in altcoins, consider whether a rebalance towards Bitcoin or stablecoins is prudent for risk management. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): During a Bitcoin Season, altcoin prices might be suppressed. This can be an opportune time to DCA into promising altcoins you’ve researched thoroughly, accumulating them at potentially lower prices. Focus on Fundamentals: Instead of chasing hype, delve into the fundamentals of altcoin projects. Look for strong teams, clear use cases, active development, and robust communities. These projects are more likely to weather a Bitcoin Season and thrive when altcoins regain momentum. Stay Informed: Continuously monitor market news, technical analysis, and the Altcoin Season Index itself. Knowledge is your most powerful tool in the volatile crypto space. Manage Expectations: Understand that not every altcoin will perform equally, especially during a Bitcoin-dominant phase. Patience and realistic expectations are vital. Remember, the cryptocurrency market is cyclical. While the Altcoin Season Index currently points to Bitcoin’s strength, the wheel will eventually turn. Being prepared for both seasons is the mark of a truly strategic investor. The Cycle Continues: A Compelling Summary The Altcoin Season Index , currently at 31, unequivocally signals that the crypto market is in a Bitcoin Season . This means Bitcoin has largely outperformed the majority of the top 100 altcoins over the past 90 days. While this phase might present challenges for immediate altcoin performance , it also offers unique opportunities for strategic accumulation and portfolio rebalancing. Understanding these distinct cryptocurrency trends , from Bitcoin dominance to the eventual resurgence of altcoins, is fundamental for long-term success in this dynamic asset class. Stay vigilant, conduct thorough research, and prepare for the market’s inevitable shifts.

The country’s Investment, Trade and Industry Minister, Zafrul Aziz, also said the ministry expects trade to grow by 4% to 5% this year, despite global economic uncertainties and the threat of tariffs weighing on outlooks. Zafrul noted that Malaysia’s exporters were adapting quickly, noting that front-loading had already taken place and was expected to continue ahead of the August 1 deadline, when another round of higher US import duties was set to take effect. The government’s tough stance amid potential economic headwinds tells a powerful tale: Malaysia will continue to be a competitive and trusted trading nation in the region, even when forced against the wall. Malaysia’s exports fall ahead of US tariff deadline Although the outlook appears rosy, new trade figures revealed some chinks in Malaysia’s export growth. Exports declined in May 2025 for the first time since September 2024 , indicating a potential rocky road ahead. The contraction has added to worries about Malaysia’s exposure to changes worldwide, such as a less open trade policy by the US, one of its biggest trading partners. At the start of May, the White House had already announced plans to slap a 24% levy on a long list of goods, including semiconductors, electronics, parts, crude palm oil, and other goods. But the rate was also increased, more quietly, to 25%, adding pressure on Malaysia to respond somehow. Should the levies go ahead, as an export-oriented country, Malaysia’s overall market share within the region could potentially be at peril. Zafrul said his ministry will “closely monitor the spill-over effect” and prepare exporters to “put in place short-term and long-term measures” if US taxes persist. Some exporters have already rushed to ship their goods before the August 1 deadline, aiming to beat the incoming tariffs . While this surge may temporarily boost current trade figures, analysts warn it could lead to a decline in the coming months as shipment volumes normalize or drop. US tariff talks put Malaysia’s economic sovereignty to the test As the deadline nears, Malaysia is making a diplomatic push to cushion or dodge the harshest tariffs. The United States seeks to eliminate caps on majority ownership in various Malaysian industries. Washington pushed for a far-reaching liberalization of key sectors, according to Zafrul. He said the government consulted other parties to consider whether the country could liberalize these sectors. For foreign ownership, Malaysia caps all strategic areas and categories like logistics, telecommunications, retail, and oil & gas. However, the US wants Malaysia to tear down these barriers in return for tariff relief or trade deals. This move could be politically catastrophic and economically disruptive if not handled carefully. The government is not against liberalization, but it would need to be strategic and inclusive for the country’s good in the long run, Zafrul said. He said discussions were not being had for the sake of having discussions, but to make sure any changes fit the context of our industrial aspirations, and that there is harmony in society.

At this point, it was reported a few weeks ago that Aqua1, a United Arab Emirates-based company, invested $100 million in WLFI. However, the truth behind the $100 million WLFI investment has emerged. It has been revealed that Aqua 1, which previously announced it would strategically purchase $100 million worth of WLFI tokens, is actually a shell company. Accordingly, it was revealed that the main company investing in WLFI was Web3Port, the controversial market maker known for the Movement (MOVE) token scandal. What Happened? As you may recall, it was revealed that Web3Port manipulated the token sale and caused serious losses to investors, which resulted in a huge reaction in the market. The incident was first revealed by Binance, which determined that a large portion of the MOVE token was sold by a market maker named Rentech, who claimed to be affiliated with Web3Port. Binance later revealed that the market maker manipulated the price of MOVE. Related News: Attention Investors! Binance Banned This Altcoin's Market Maker! $38 Million Support Came From The Altcoin Team! Following these incidents, Binance decided to remove the market maker of the altcoin MOVE from its exchange due to its illegal activities. Binance also announced that it had seized the $38 million in USDT proceeds from this MOVE sale. Movement Labs then partnered with Binance to develop a buyback strategy using these funds and attempt to re-inflate the price. Coinbase also delisted the MOVE altcoin. Immediately following Coinbase's delisting, Movement Labs announced the suspension of its co-founder, Rushi Manche, due to a market manipulation scandal. Market maker Web3Port has been banned by many decentralized exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase, on suspicion of market manipulation. *This is not investment advice.

Ethereum ETFs just recorded their biggest inflows since launch, reflecting deepening institutional activity. Liquidations for ETH are well above $100 million daily, given today’s price correction, but the asset is well ahead weekly. GENIUS Act Vote Could Shift Ethereum Demand Ethereum (ETH) was trading near $2,975 as of press time, holding steady after a 17% gain over the last week. Traders are closely watching the US House, which is preparing to vote on the GENIUS Act. This bill could change how stablecoins are regulated and bring major capital to Ethereum. The bill, which already passed the Senate on June 18, would require stablecoin issuers to hold 1:1 reserves and register under federal guidelines. Anti-money laundering compliance would be mandatory. Meanwhile, the House is likely to approve the bill this week, with the platform showing a 95% chance of passage, per Polymarket forecasts. Citing the expected influx of institutional-grade capital if the law is adopted, analyst Ted noted : “ETH pumps if the GENIUS Act passes this week.” Alongside the GENIUS Act, two other crypto-focused bills are scheduled for debate this week. The CLARITY Act would define digital assets as either securities or commodities, potentially ending the long-standing SEC–CFTC dispute. The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, meanwhile, would prevent the rollout of a central bank digital currency in the United States, citing privacy concerns. ETF Activity and Corporate Accumulation Rising Ethereum’s recent momentum has been supported by growing institutional interest. Glassnode data shows that US-listed Ethereum ETFs brought in 225,857 ETH in net inflows last week, the strongest since their launch. This follows a steady accumulation trend by major treasury holders. $ETH broke above $3K for the first time since February. Meanwhile, US spot #Ethereum ETFs recorded their largest weekly net inflows since launch – 225,857 #ETH – extending a multi-week trend of growing institutional demand. pic.twitter.com/zRuhsE4f0u — glassnode (@glassnode) July 14, 2025 In the past month alone, Ethereum treasury companies have acquired more than 545,000 ETH, with an estimated value exceeding $1.6 billion. On-chain indicators show consistent buying during market rallies. Notably, the current technical setup shows a confirmed breakout pattern, often described as a “bull flag,” with ETH holding above the key $3,000 level. Liquidations Point to Shifting Sentiment Over 130,000 traders were liquidated in the past 24 hours, with total losses nearing $500 million, according to Coinglass data. Ethereum was the second-largest contributor to this number, with $106 million in wrecked long positions. If ETH can reclaim the $3,000 resistance with sustained buying, traders are monitoring $3,300 as the next one. A confirmed break could open a path toward $4,000.

The new system features tokenized versions of real-world assets ( RWAs ), fully backed and settled on-chain, while offering transparent audit trails and promising to blend blockchain and traditional finance (TradFi). A significant milestone for blockchain finance, the rollout led to a 13% surge in Robinhood’s share price. Tokenized equities As blockchain adoption expands, more businesses are turning to tokenized shares as a new way to raise capital. Namely, instead of issuing traditional stock certificates, companies can now offer equity in the form of digital assets, such as crypto , to expedite their operations and potentially expand their global reach. Robinhood’s tokenized trading platform runs on the Ethereum ( ETH ) compatible Robinhood Chain, developed using Arbitrum’s ( ARB ) Orbit framework, and now offers tokenized exposure to private firms like SpaceX and OpenAI . These promotional tokens don’t confer direct ownership but are structured as derivatives , mimicking the value of shares based on secondary market pricing. As Andrei Grachev, Managing Partner of DWF Labs, puts it: “The technology is live. Robinhood’s EU tokenized equity launch includes 200+ U.S. stocks and ETFs, trading 24/5 with zero commissions, triggering a 13 % stock price gain. Globally, we also see Kraken and Coinbase rolling out similar programs. These tokens are fully backed, settle on‑chain with audit trails, and resolve real‑world inefficiencies but frameworks must evolve to recognize infrastructure upgrades over regulatory evasion.” — Andrei Grachev, Managing Partner of DWF Labs Robinhood regulatory scrutiny Robinhood’s rapid expansion into tokenized assets quickly drew regulatory attention. For instance, the Bank of Lithuania, which regulates the platform’s EU operations, requested additional details about the private company tokens. In response, Robinhood remained adamant that the offerings comply with the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) and Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) frameworks, which treat such tokens as derivative instruments rather than direct equity holdings. In the meantime, OpenAI publicly distanced itself from the offering, cautioning users against trading the tokens as they do not represent OpenAI equity. Robinhood Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Vlad Tewnev responded to the controversy by clarifying that the product is “enabled by Robinhood’s ownership stake in a special purpose vehicle,” not by direct equity ownership. Tenev further explained that OpenAI’s hybrid organizational model (originally a non-profit, now encompassing a capped-profit subsidiary) permits institutional investors to gain exposure through complex financial instruments. These may include conversion rights or other derivatives, Tenev argued, which Robinhood mirrors in its tokenized product for retail access.

Arcadia Finance, which operates on the Base blockchain, was targeted on July 15 in a swift and sophisticated attack that drained user funds from multiple vaults. According to blockchain security firm Cyvers, the attacker exploited a flaw in Arcadia’s Rebalancer contract by passing in arbitrary swap parameters. This allowed them to trigger unauthorised token swaps that bypassed normal checks, ultimately allowing them to drain funds from user vaults without proper validation. At around 04:05:58 UTC today, the attackers deployed a malicious contract and triggered a sequence of unauthorized transactions. Within a minute, the attacker began siphoning funds from the platform and subsequently converting the stolen tokens to Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) on the Base network before bridging them to Ethereum mainnet addresses. Cyvers traced the funds and found that the attacker received 199 WETH and over 965 million AERO tokens during the swap process. The stolen cryptocurrencies included approximately 2.3 million USDC and 227,000 USDS, distributed across 12 affected addresses. To obscure their trail, the attacker distributed the funds across intermediary wallets, with Cyvers estimating that the attacker may be preparing to launder the funds via cryptocurrency mixers. As an immediate post-incident measure, Arcadia Finance has issued a public alert urging users to revoke permissions granted to the platform’s Rebalancer. The team has acknowledged the exploit on social media, confirming “unauthorised transactions via a Rebalancer” and assured users that more information would follow. Researchers at Cyvers have recommended contacting exchanges and bridge operators to blacklist the attacker’s addresses on Base and Ethereum and file reports with law enforcement to prevent further attacks. This is not the first time Arcadia Finance has become the victim of an exploit that led to losses. In July 2023, the protocol lost around $455,000 due to another vulnerability in code across some of its contracts. At the time, most of the stolen funds were funneled through Tornado Cash. DeFi exploits continue to plague crypto users The Arcadia Finance exploit is the latest in a string of defi-related exploits that have transpired in recent months. Last month alone, multiple protocols were exploited by bad actors. For instance, in late June, a hacker was able to launch a price manipulation attack on DeFi protocol Resupply to siphon roughly $9.6 million in crypto. Just days before, Blockchain security auditor Hacken lost roughly $250,000 worth of its native HAI token due to a compromised private key. Over $2.47 billion has been lost to hacks, scams, and exploits across the crypto sector, according to blockchain security firm CertiK. As previously covered in Invezz, Q2 2025 alone saw more than $800 million in losses from 144 incidents, although the figure represented a 52% drop in total value lost compared to the first quarter.

Imagine a digital currency as stable as the Korean won, seamlessly integrated into your daily transactions. This isn’t just a distant dream; Korea Investment and Securities, a prominent financial powerhouse, is actively exploring the creation of a won-based stablecoin , signaling a groundbreaking shift in the nation’s financial future. Won-based Stablecoin: A Game Changer for Korea? A won-based stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, pegged directly to the Korean won. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, its value would theoretically remain constant, making it ideal for everyday transactions, remittances, and even as a foundation for more complex financial products. This stability is its core strength, offering the benefits of blockchain technology without the price volatility typically associated with digital assets. Stability: Directly tied to the Korean won, minimizing price fluctuations and offering a reliable medium of exchange. Efficiency: Potentially enabling faster and cheaper transactions compared to traditional banking systems, especially for cross-border payments. Accessibility: Could enhance financial inclusion by providing easier access to digital financial services for a broader population. Innovation: Opens doors for new financial services, decentralized applications (dApps), and integration into emerging Web3 ecosystems. This strategic move by Korea Investment and Securities isn’t just about creating a new digital asset; it’s about reimagining how money moves and is used within the economy, setting the stage for significant advancements in digital finance. South Korean Stablecoin Ambitions: What’s Driving Them? South Korea has long been at the forefront of technological adoption, and its interest in a South Korean stablecoin reflects a broader global trend towards digital currencies. The nation’s advanced tech infrastructure and high internet penetration make it fertile ground for such innovations. The drive stems from several factors, positioning South Korea to potentially lead in this evolving space: Key Driver Description Global Digital Shift Nations worldwide are actively exploring Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and regulated private stablecoins, pushing for digital transformation in finance. Enhanced Financial Inclusion The potential to provide accessible and efficient financial services to a wider demographic, including those underserved by traditional banking. Competitive Edge Positioning South Korea as a leader in digital finance and blockchain innovation, attracting investment and talent. Streamlined Transactions The ability to streamline cross-border payments and reduce transaction costs, particularly beneficial for a trade-reliant economy like South Korea’s. The development of a robust South Korean stablecoin ecosystem could significantly bolster the nation’s economic infrastructure and digital competitiveness. Navigating Stablecoin Regulation: The Path Ahead One of the most critical aspects of any stablecoin initiative is robust stablecoin regulation . Governments globally are grappling with how to oversee these digital assets to protect consumers, prevent illicit activities, and maintain financial stability. Korea Investment and Securities’ proactive approach, including establishing an internal task force, highlights their commitment to aligning with upcoming regulatory frameworks. The task force is specifically studying international cases, learning from the successes and challenges faced by other jurisdictions in implementing and regulating stablecoins. This foresight is crucial, as clear and comprehensive stablecoin regulation will be the bedrock upon which trust and widespread adoption are built. Without a well-defined regulatory landscape, the full potential of these digital assets cannot be realized, making compliance a top priority for institutions entering this space. Korea Investment Securities: At the Forefront of Innovation The involvement of a major financial player like Korea Investment Securities underscores the growing institutional interest in digital assets. Their decision to consider a trademark filing and form a dedicated task force isn’t merely a speculative venture; it’s a strategic move to prepare for a future where digital currencies play a more central role in the global economy. This commitment positions them as a key innovator in the evolving financial landscape. The task force’s mandate extends beyond just technical development; it involves a multifaceted approach: Studying global best practices in stablecoin design, implementation, and risk management.

Despite rallying over 27% in the past week and briefly reclaiming the $3 mark on July 14, the token has pulled back to around $2.86, sparking fresh speculation about market manipulation and whale behavior.

Are you seeing this? pic.twitter.com/fWKQUESNqQ — Ali (@ali_charts) July 14, 2025 Is XRP Being Suppressed? The Theory Resurfaces Versan Aljarrah , co-founder of Black Swan Capitalist , believes the XRP price is being deliberately suppressed by large institutions, he claimed: “XRP can’t even stay above $3 because it threatens everything.” According to Aljarrah, XRP’s unique real-world utility —especially its ability to enable instant cross-border payments —poses a serious threat to traditional financial systems. He implies that maintaining the status quo benefits entities invested in slow, high-fee global payments, and therefore suppressing XRP becomes strategic. This suppression theory is not new. Many XRP holders have long pointed to: Ripple’s monthly escrow unlocks Algorithmic trading patterns Ongoing regulatory scrutiny as tactics that limit the token’s price discovery. On-Chain Data Shows Whale Confidence Growing Despite the pullback, on-chain metrics point to increasing confidence among large holders. Whale wallets (holding over 1 million XRP) have surged to 2,743+ These wallets collectively control over 47 billion XRP Data shows steady accumulation during dips, hinting at strong long-term belief in XRP’s fundamentals. This increase in whale activity suggests that major investors are positioning themselves for a potential long-term breakout . Volatility Spikes: What’s Next for XRP? XRP’s implied volatility has surged to 96% , suggesting a potential 13% price swing in either direction this week. While price action remains choppy, the setup looks promising if XRP can break through resistance with volume. Key Scenarios to Watch: Scenario Impact Breakout above $3 with strong volume Bullish continuation toward $4–$6 Failure to reclaim $3 Possible retest of $2.60–$2.80 support zone High volatility continues Short-term chop likely before breakout Final Thoughts: Is XRP Ready for a Major Rally? The XRP community is split. Some see this dip as strategic suppression , while others argue it’s just profit-taking and resistance testing . With Crypto Week underway and macro factors in play, the stage is set for a decisive move. Until XRP clears the $3 level with conviction , expect heightened volatility and mixed sentiment. But if volume confirms a breakout, XRP could aim for $4–$6 in the near term, potentially even higher if whale accumulation continues and market sentiment improves. FAQ Why is XRP Price Down Today? XRP dropped below $3 due to strong profit-taking near resistance and rising market volatility. Is XRP price being suppressed? Some analysts and XRP supporters believe institutional actors suppress the price to limit its disruptive potential in finance. What’s XRP Price Prediction for 2025 Analysts like Peter Brandt and Ali Martinez foresee a rally to $4.47–$4.80 if XRP closes above $3 with volume. Are whales buying XRP?

Excitement over upcoming legislation in the U.S. has spurred bitcoin’s recent rally, the german lender said, but it is notable that the crypto's rise has also been accompanied by a historic decline in volatility levels. The world's largest cryptocurrency has risen nearly 75% since mid-November, driven by a mix of favorable regulations, growing institutional adoption, and global macroeconomic shifts, the report said. The rally coincides with “Crypto Week” in Washington, DC, highlighting increasing government and corporate engagement with digital assets. This week the House of Representatives is set to vote on the CLARITY Act, a crypto market structure bill, and the GENIUS Act, which regulates stablecoins in the U.S. Deutsche Bank suggests the drop in volatility signals a maturing market, where regulatory clarity, broader adoption, and long-term investment behaviors are stabilizing performance. As bitcoin gains legitimacy through regulation and integration into traditional portfolios, it may continue to shed its speculative image and evolve into a more stable, strategic asset, the report added. As volatility decreases and regulatory certainty increases, bitcoin is becoming more appealing for pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and other long-term allocators.

On Tuesday, long-term government yields quietly hit levels not seen before. The 30-year Japanese bond yield jumped to 3.20%, a fresh record. It didn’t come with alarms, but the fallout is loud. Since 2019, those same bonds have now lost 45% of their value. The financial damage is starting to spread, and confidence in the country’s ability to manage its debt is sinking, fast. According to CNBC, this collapse has triggered a chain reaction. Over the past year, yields on the 30Y note climbed by 100 basis points, a surge that’s left institutional portfolios in tatters. Japan’s four largest life insurers reported their unrealized losses on domestic bonds shot up from around $15 billion to $60 billion in Q1 2025. That’s not a small uptick—that’s four times bigger in just one year. Bank of Japan absorbs the damage The worst numbers are coming from the Bank of Japan. The central bank reported $198 billion in unrealized losses on government bonds for Fiscal Year 2024. One year earlier, that figure was around $66 billion. The losses have tripled, and nothing suggests they’re slowing down. In fact, the bleed is accelerating. It’s not just a bad year, it’s a system that’s starting to break. That breakdown is now visible in Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio, which has officially crossed 260%, the highest level in the country’s modern history. That ratio is now double that of the United States, even though the U.S. is also ramping up deficit spending under President Donald Trump. While America might be following behind, Japan is already deep in the hole. There’s another problem: who holds all this collapsing debt? The Bank of Japan itself owns 52% of all domestic government bonds. Life insurers only hold 13.4%, banks hold 9.8%, and pension funds 8.9%. That means over half of the bonds crashing on fears of a default are held by the issuer. It’s the equivalent of lending money to yourself and then watching your own IOUs burn. Global markets feel the pressure Zooming out, this isn’t just about Japan. The U.S. 10-year yield has risen by nearly 500% since 2020, just behind the jump in Japan’s 30Y. That’s because Washington is flooding the market with bonds to finance Trump’s aggressive fiscal push. As supply rises, prices drop. The situation is dragging global bond markets into uncharted territory. Inflation is making it worse. In May, Japan’s core CPI, excluding fresh food, rose 3.7% year-over-year, the fastest pace since January 2023. That’s the exact scenario U.S. Federal Reserve officials are trying to avoid, and it’s why they keep warning that interest rates may stay “higher for longer.” And then there’s the weirdest part: Germany’s 30Y bond yields are almost identical to Japan’s, around 3.1%. But Germany has a Debt-to-GDP ratio of 62% and a policy rate of 2.25%, compared to Japan’s 0.50% and 260%+ debt ratio. The math doesn’t add up. It shows the global market is under pressure and nobody wants to be the first to cut spending. Now, Japan’s mess is a warning to everyone else. A preview of what happens when governments rely too much on debt. Bond market liquidity is already worse than during the 2008 financial crisis. That’s not speculation, it’s a fact. And investors are reacting. This is why Bitcoin and gold are both exploding to all-time highs. People are moving their money out of bonds and into hard assets. The market isn’t waiting around for politicians to fix it. It already knows what’s coming. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

48282338,https://timestabloid.com/?p=74318,1752573629,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Whales Are Moving From Dogecoin (DOGE) to This Promising DeFi Token with 200% Potential Upside,https://timestabloid.com/whales-are-moving-from-dogecoin-doge-to-this-promising-defi/,"Recent on-chain data is confirming what sharp-eyed analysts have been watching unfold: large wallets are reducing their exposure to meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and reallocating into real-yield DeFi protocols. One token in particular is grabbing serious attention— Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . With whale wallets now diverting capital from speculative assets into functional decentralized infrastructure, MUTM is rising as a preferred destination. The appeal isn’t difficult to see. While meme coins have delivered short-term hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating a non-custodial, lending-based ecosystem where investors earn yield and borrowers access liquidity across a two-pronged lending engine. The platform’s utility, revenue-sharing structure, and upcoming stablecoin system provide real value—something Dogecoin (DOGE) never offered. 73% Sold at $0.03, Listing at $0.06: The Final Window Is Narrowing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 5 of its presale. With $12.2 million raised, over 13,200 holders, and 73% of the tokens already sold, only 27% remain available at the current price of $0.03. Once the supply is fully taken, the next presale phase will open at $0.035—a 20% jump ahead of the final $0.06 listing price. Early investors from Phase 1, who secured entry at $0.01, are already sitting on 200% paper gains. With the listing price already scheduled and strong market support forming, current buyers are still in the running for 5x returns at launch and much more in the following growth phase. But this token is not just about presale hype. The infrastructure is backed by a live roadmap with major milestones already being implemented. mtTokens—such as mtETH, mtUSDT, or mtBTC—can be staked into dividend-generating smart contracts. Revenue earned from borrowing activity is programmed to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market and distribute them to mtToken stakers, enhancing yield with a second stream of returns. The stablecoin currently in development is another major step. Designed to always hold a $1 peg, it will be minted only when borrowers create overcollateralized loans and automatically burned on repayment or liquidation. Minting will be capped per issuer, and interest rates will be managed by protocol governance to maintain price stability. Security has also been prioritized. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has completed a third-party smart contract audit with CertiK, earning a 95.00 Token Scan Score and a 77.50 Skynet rating. A $50,000 Bug Bounty is now live to further ensure safety. At launch, the Beta version of the platform will go live, supported by full Layer-2 scaling, offering lower fees and faster transactions for all users. To amplify its community growth, the team has also rolled out a $100,000 giveaway , with ten winners each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM. Where Lending Meets Long-Term Yield Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate on two lending tracks: a peer-to-contract (P2C) model and a peer-to-peer (P2P) alternative. In the P2C model, users will be able to deposit blue-chip assets and stablecoins like BTC, ETH, USDT, or DAI into audited liquidity pools that fund overcollateralized loans. For instance, depositing 2 BTC ($115,000/BTC) into a pool with an 8% APY would generate around $18,400 per year. Depositors will receive mtTokens—such as mtBTC—that grow in value as interest accrues and can also be used for staking rewards or future borrowing. In the P2P model, users will create custom lending agreements directly. For example, a lender may offer 10,000 SHIBA INU tokens, while the borrower locks DAI as collateral. With a negotiated 16% APR, both parties will benefit from tailored terms within a fully decentralized, non-custodial structure. This P2P layer is designed to handle riskier or less liquid assets like meme coins, isolated from the main liquidity pools. Mutuum’s dynamic loan-to-value (LTV) system will enhance both models. Depending on asset type and risk, borrowers will be able to access between 40% and 80% LTV or beyond. Loans will remain open-ended with no fixed repayment date unless liquidation thresholds are breached. All lending activity will be transparently executed on-chain, ensuring users always retain full control over their funds without custodial risk. Whales Don’t Chase Hype—They Hunt Value As Dogecoin (DOGE) flows slow and institutional eyes scan for real yield, the quiet accumulation of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) becomes more obvious. This is no short-lived gamble. This is a presale building toward a long-term decentralized lending ecosystem, offering real returns backed by algorithmic design, on-chain automation, and provable security. The $0.03 window is closing fast. Once the next phase begins at $0.035, those who hesitated will be looking at a higher cost for the same token. As big wallets reposition into infrastructure tokens with utility and yield, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands as their latest top target. Now’s your chance.

48282352,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=177987,1752573635,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/48282352.jpeg,China Stablecoins: CICC Unveils Crucial Insights on Their Future,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/china-stablecoins-cicc-insights/,"BitcoinWorld China Stablecoins: CICC Unveils Crucial Insights on Their Future The world of digital currencies is constantly evolving, with stablecoins often touted as the bridge between volatile cryptocurrencies and traditional fiat. However, a fascinating and crucial perspective has emerged from China, challenging the universal necessity of these digital assets. China International Capital Corporation (CICC), a leading investment bank, has unveiled its findings, suggesting that independent blockchain-based China stablecoins are unlikely to find a foothold in the nation’s already sophisticated financial landscape. Why China’s Payment Ecosystem Already Excels For many, the idea of a stablecoin offers a solution to the volatility inherent in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. But what if a country’s existing payment infrastructure already provides the stability, efficiency, and low costs that stablecoins promise? This is precisely the argument put forth by CICC. China’s digital payment realm is dominated by giants like WeChat Pay and Alipay, which have fundamentally transformed how transactions occur for hundreds of millions of people. Consider these points about China’s existing payment ecosystem : “Quasi-Stablecoin” Functionality: CICC highlights that platforms like WeChat Pay already operate as “quasi-stablecoins.” Users hold balances pegged directly to the renminbi (RMB), ensuring price stability. These balances are backed by legal reserves, mirroring the very mechanism stablecoins aim to achieve. Unmatched Efficiency and Low Cost: One of the most compelling aspects is the transaction fees. WeChat Pay and Alipay charge ultra-low fees, often just a fraction of a percent. This stands in stark contrast to the multi-percent fees sometimes seen on overseas platforms, including those for certain stablecoin transactions. Widespread Adoption: Digital payments are ubiquitous in China, from street vendors to high-end retailers. The convenience and speed are unparalleled, making cash almost obsolete in many urban areas. This mature, efficient, and incredibly low-cost environment means the core problems that independent stablecoins seek to solve—volatility, high fees, and slow transactions—simply don’t exist to the same degree within China’s domestic payment system. Dissecting the CICC Report: A Deep Dive The recent CICC report , as noted by JinSe Finance, delves into the specifics of why independent stablecoins would struggle to gain traction. The report essentially argues that the existing infrastructure has already achieved what stablecoins aspire to, but with the added benefits of established regulatory oversight and widespread trust. The bank’s analysis suggests that the value proposition of a new, blockchain-based stablecoin is significantly diminished when compared to the seamless experience already provided by dominant players. For the average Chinese consumer or business, switching to a new, potentially less regulated, and less integrated stablecoin system would offer no discernible advantages and might even introduce unnecessary friction or risk. Furthermore, China maintains strict capital controls and a tightly regulated financial system. The introduction of independent stablecoins, especially those not directly controlled or overseen by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), would likely conflict with these existing frameworks. The nation prioritizes financial stability and control, making it inherently cautious about decentralized financial instruments that could circumvent its established mechanisms. The Digital Yuan: China’s Own Stablecoin Solution? It’s impossible to discuss China stablecoins without addressing the elephant in the room: the Digital Yuan (e-CNY). While not a blockchain-based stablecoin in the decentralized sense, the e-CNY is China’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) and serves as a digital version of its fiat currency. This government-backed digital currency is undergoing extensive trials and is designed to integrate seamlessly into the existing payment ecosystem. The Digital Yuan essentially functions as the ultimate official stablecoin, offering: Sovereign Backing: Directly issued and guaranteed by the PBOC, ensuring ultimate stability and trust. Programmability: Potential for smart contract-like features, allowing for specific use cases and enhanced financial control. Integration: Designed to work alongside WeChat Pay and Alipay, not replace them, but rather offer another layer of digital payment infrastructure. Enhanced Oversight: Provides the central bank with greater visibility and control over monetary flows, crucial for financial stability and combating illicit activities. The existence and ongoing rollout of the Digital Yuan further solidify CICC’s argument. If the state itself is providing a digital, stable version of its currency, the need for private, independent stablecoins diminishes even further. Why would consumers or businesses opt for a less official, potentially riskier alternative when a state-backed digital currency offers superior security and integration? Global Stablecoin Trends vs. China’s Unique Path Globally, stablecoins like USDT and USDC play a significant role in the cryptocurrency market, often serving as liquidity bridges, trading pairs, and a store of value during market volatility. Regulatory discussions around stablecoins are intense in the West, with governments exploring frameworks for their oversight and issuance. However, China’s approach stands in stark contrast. Its robust and centralized payment ecosystem , coupled with its proactive development of the Digital Yuan, positions it uniquely. Unlike many Western nations where stablecoins emerged to fill perceived gaps in traditional finance or to offer a decentralized alternative, China’s financial system already provides highly efficient digital payment solutions. The focus in China is on control, stability, and integration within the existing state-led financial framework, rather than fostering decentralized alternatives. This difference in philosophy and existing infrastructure explains why the CICC report comes to its seemingly counter-intuitive conclusion for those accustomed to Western crypto narratives. For China, the ‘problem’ that stablecoins solve simply isn’t a pressing issue domestically. What Does This Mean for the Future of Digital Finance? CICC’s assessment offers crucial insights into China’s strategic direction regarding digital currencies. It underscores a clear preference for a centrally controlled, efficient, and highly integrated digital financial system, rather than one driven by independent, decentralized blockchain projects. This doesn’t mean China is against all forms of digital innovation; quite the opposite, as seen with the Digital Yuan. However, the innovation must align with national priorities of stability, control, and efficiency. For global crypto enthusiasts and developers, this perspective from CICC serves as a powerful reminder that not all markets operate under the same assumptions or have the same needs. While stablecoins may be transformative in some regions, their utility is context-dependent. In China, the existing financial architecture and regulatory environment have already addressed many of the challenges that stablecoins aim to overcome. In conclusion, CICC’s assessment provides a compelling argument for why independent stablecoins are unlikely to make significant inroads in China. The nation’s mature, efficient, and incredibly low-cost payment ecosystem, spearheaded by giants like WeChat Pay , coupled with the ongoing development of the Digital Yuan , effectively negates the core value proposition of private stablecoins. China’s digital financial future appears to be one of centralized innovation and unparalleled efficiency, built upon its already formidable foundation.

Analyst Warns This Might Be a Short-Lived Alt Window appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is leading the crypto rally once again, surging to a new all-time high of $123,000 earlier this month. So far in July, BTC has gained 9.79%, and in the last seven days alone, it jumped by 8.8%, reigniting investor excitement across the market. But with Bitcoin dominance rising, the big question now is: Will altcoins follow—or is this another fakeout? Bitcoin Breaks $120K, Is It Time for Altseason? $BTC just hit a new ATH at $123,000. But where are the altcoin pumps? I’ve gone back through the last 3 $BTC breakouts to find patterns and the signs are finally lining up. Here's what to expect next for $ETH , $SOL , $XRP , and… — VirtualBacon (@VirtualBacon0x) July 14, 2025 Bitcoin Breaks Out to $123K Bitcoin’s bullish momentum continues, marking a 15.9% gain between June 23 and July 15 . This rally pushed BTC from $107K to $123K , a 14.95% jump , making it the biggest breakout of Q3 so far. In Q2 2025, Bitcoin recorded an impressive 29.9% return , supported by: April: +14.2% May: +11.1% June: +2.40% So far in Q3, Bitcoin is already up 9.69% —and counting.

Popular analyst VirtualBacon shared a detailed thread on X, analyzing BTC’s current breakout and what it means for altcoins. According to him, this may not be a full-blown altseason , but rather a short “altcoin rotation window” . Historically, after each major BTC breakout since mid-2023 , altcoins typically rallied for 3–5 weeks before Bitcoin resumed dominance.

The only pullback was a 4.83% drop in May, which quickly recovered. VirtualBacon emphasizes that a sustained altcoin season needs BTC dominance to decline , something that hasn’t happened yet. But short-term opportunities may still exist. Altcoins to Watch Now VirtualBacon highlights several altcoins with breakout potential: BNB : Near cycle lows LINK : Undervalued with strong fundamentals ADA : Forming a macro double-bottom TRX : Quiet strength DOGE : Known for rallying post-BTC breakouts He also notes Solana ecosystem tokens are showing strength: Bonk : +110.9% (14 days) PENGU : +112.9% (14 days) Emerging Layer-1s and smart contract platforms are also on the radar: SUI, Aptos (APT), and Avalanche (AVAX) —with AVAX yet to rally since October 2023 . Meanwhile, narrative-driven tokens like TAO (14x in 5 months) and PEPE (6.6x in 3 months) have shown what’s possible during strong Bitcoin uptrends. What Happens If Bitcoin Hits $150K? VirtualBacon predicts that if BTC touches $150K , the top 20 altcoins could explode in value, as institutional and retail investors look for the next big opportunity. While Bitcoin leads the charge, altcoins may have a short-term window to rally .

Personal wealth management, special life events, and a flight to less volatile assets are all valid reasons to sell. The 500-day Bitcoin halving model, Pi Cycle Top Indicator, Crypto Fear and Greed Index, and RSI all assist in forecasting the market top. Proactively move crypto to exchanges, unstake any assets, understand fees and taxes, set partial profit targets, and monitor for blow-off tops. Introduction If you are a Hodler of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), congratulations! It's been on a great run lately, up 39% over the past 3 months. Bitcoin 3-month chart (Coingecko.com) Most cryptocurrencies have also enjoyed bullish trends recently, and the market appears poised for further gains. So, if the market continues to surge, what’s your plan? Will you hold forever or take profits? When’s the right time to sell? What groundwork should you lay now? This article offers practical insights on spotting a potential market peak and preparing accordingly. Having a plan before the market overheats is critical. To sell or not to sell, that is the question Why would anyone consider selling their Bitcoin? Michael Saylor has famously said , “Never sell your Bitcoin.” To Mr. Saylor, I'd say, ""You do you."" For the rest of us, personal circumstances should guide our decisions. Finance is an area of life where we should seek as much guidance as possible but never abdicate our final authority. I’m not here to push anyone to sell, but there are three compelling reasons to consider liquidating Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies this cycle. The first is wealth management . Five years ago, BTC traded around $10,000 per coin. An investment then is now nearly worth 12X. Those courageous enough to buy during the COVID market dip in March 2020 would now see gains of almost 24X. For some, crypto holdings have grown to dominate their entire portfolio. There is nothing wrong with rebalancing holdings to diversify into metals, quality real estate, and yield-bearing investments. The second reason is various life events, the chief of which is buying a home. Purchasing real estate triggers the immediate need for large amounts of capital, at least for a down payment. Some may prefer to sell enough assets to avoid a mortgage altogether, eliminating the long-term interest costs and providing the wonderful security of outright ownership. Some other important life events could be educational expenses, sudden medical bills, starting a business, or just to cash in your chips for normal or early retirement. The last is what I call crypto fatigue . Some of us have weathered multiple crypto cycles. When I first bought a substantial amount of Bitcoin, the price plummeted 66% in a few months and languished there for two years. Now I'm in my fourth crypto cycle, and I've seen it all. Bitcoin crashes of up to 80%, alt coins soaring and then going to zero, the ICO boom, the NFT craze, the Terra Luna crash, the collapse of FTX, Celsius, Voyager, and Three Arrows Capital, and too many scammers to count. Crypto offers high rewards but comes with extreme risk, volatility, and wild events. The emotional pain of drawdowns, scams, and crashes drives many to seek calmer, safer investments. Market top indicators A rookie crypto mistake is relying on gut feelings to take profits. Formulate an exit strategy well in advance and start by identifying when to sell. There are many models useful to forecast the potential price peak of the Bitcoin cycle. Here are summaries of some popular ones. I recommend using several methods in tandem because, as the old saying goes, there is wisdom in a multitude of counselors. The 500-day Bitcoin halving model This ties the price of Bitcoin to its halving events, which occur roughly every four years. The strategy, in a nutshell, is to buy 500 days before the halving and sell 500 days afterwards. Bitcoin prices 500 days before and after halvings Halving Date 500 Days Before Price 500 Days Before 500 Days After Price 500 Days After Approx. Return July 9, 2016 February 25, 2015 ~$238 November 25, 2017 ~$8,200 ~3,345% May 11, 2020 December 28, 2018 ~$3,800 September 26, 2021 ~$43,000 ~1,032% Note: the 500-day post-halving price target is not exact to the day. In 2017, the BTC cycle high was actually in December; in 2021, it was in October. But this model serves as a great ""two-minute warning"" for the end of the game. The last Bitcoin halving occurred on April 20, 2024, and 500 days after is September 1, 2025. Historical trends would suggest a cycle high slightly after that date, somewhere in September or October 2025. Bonus: Given that the next Bitcoin halving is estimated to occur in March or April 2028, the next cycle low buying opportunity would be October or November 2026. Pi Cycle Top Indicator This technical analysis tool identifies potential market inflection points. It's based on the relationship between two moving BTC averages, the 111-day (111DMA) and the 350-day multiplied by 2 (350DMA x 2). When the 111MDA crosses above the 350DMA x 2, it indicates the start of a bull run. When the 111DMA crosses below the 350DMA × 2, the charts tell the story of a price peak and subsequent correction. The Pi Cycle Indicator complements the 500-day halving model by providing a more precise signal for when to sell within the 500-day post-halving window. Pi Cycle Top Indicator (Bitbo.io) The Pi Cycle Indicator has predicted Bitcoin market tops in past cycles: 2013: It signaled tops during Bitcoin’s run to $1,000 2017: Flagged the peak near $20,000 in December 2021: Indicated a top around $69,000 in November 2025: As of July 2025, the crossover has not yet been confirmed Crypto Fear and Greed Index Crypto Fear and Greed Index (Coinmarketcap.com) This is an interesting, proprietary tool from the folks at CoinMarketCap. It measures and displays investor sentiment, which is often another clue for buying and selling. From their website : This index ranges from 0 to 100, where a lower value indicates extreme fear, and a higher value indicates extreme greed. It helps investors understand the emotional state of the market, which can influence buying and selling behaviors. The index provides insights into whether the market may be undervalued (extreme fear) or overvalued (extreme greed). By observing the current value of the index, you can gauge the overall mood of the cryptocurrency market. For example, a high value suggests that investors are overly greedy, which may indicate that the market is overheated and due for a correction. Conversely, a low value may suggest that fear is driving prices down, potentially creating buying opportunities. This Fear and Greed Index has only been in existence since mid-2023, so historical data is not available for the previous cycle peaks. However, the all-time high was 92, set in March of 2024, when Bitcoin was at $72,125. The price subsequently slumped for about 6 months and bottomed around $52,000. Despite its limited historical data for past cycles, this tool can still be very valuable. I suggest closely monitoring when it surpasses its all-time high. When used alongside other tools, values above 92 may indicate an approaching market peak. The Fear and Greed Index's current value of 70 suggests we are still early in the final market cycle. Relative Strength Index, or RSI RSI is one of the most commonly used top and bottom indicators. It's a momentum oscillator tracking the closing prices over a given time period. Most charting platforms automatically calculate and display it. Traditionally, when the RSI value is over 70, the asset is considered overbought (sell signal), and those under 30 indicate the asset is oversold (buy signal). But these values are not set in stone, and Bitcoin can stay in the overbought territory for a while before the price actually decreases. Bitcoin's RSI recently surpassed 70, signaling entry into the overbought area and a potential short-term price correction. As an isolated metric, this does not indicate a market top. It highlights the need to combine multiple tools for a comprehensive macro perspective. Final note: These are all tools, not guarantees. Bitcoin’s volatility, market risks, and unpredictable events require extra vigilance during critical periods. Other indicators of market sentiment Watch for signs of retail FOMO (fear of missing out), such as friends and family asking, “What should I buy?” Spikes in downloads of the Coinbase app will signal mass market entry. You'll have experts on CNBC talking non-stop about their latest picks, and crypto will grace national magazine covers. These are signs the bull market is nearing its end. Preparing to sell As the bull market nears its peak, is your crypto 100% ready to sell? If you’re self-custodying, do you have a plan to transfer to an exchange before the end-stage market frenzy hits? Many platforms still struggle with operational issues during times of peak usage, and delays in transferring assets could mean missing your optimal selling window. Have you completed all unstaking of crypto assets well in advance? Polkadot ( DOT-USD ) offers great yield rates for staking but requires a 28-day unbonding period. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) may require weeks to free coins for transfer, depending on the platform. Understand the rules for your staking situation and unbond your coins appropriately before the sale. Do you know the commission your exchange will charge for the sale of your coins? These rules can vary greatly and can erode profit if not anticipated ahead of time and managed. Does your exchange offer an OTC desk with advantageous commission rates for larger transactions? Are you prequalified and familiar with the process? Have you linked your bank to your preferred exchange? Have you made successful test transfers of cash out of your trading platform? What are your withdrawal limits? Many exchanges use a tiered verification system that determines user limits for deposits and withdrawals. Imagine a substantial profit stuck on an exchange but limited by low daily or monthly withdrawal thresholds. Have you planned for taxes? Will your sales be classified as short-term or long-term gains? Are the purchase dates accurately recorded, and will that make a difference for short-term (less than 1 year) versus long-term (1 year or longer) gains? Short-term gains are treated as ordinary income. In 2025, they will remain at seven levels: 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%. Long-term gains have tax rates of 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on taxable income and filing status, excluding the NIIT. See the chart below: Capital gains tax rate 2025 (Nerdwallet.com) The net investment income tax (NIIT) is an additional 2.8% tax that kicks in if your income reaches certain thresholds. Investors taking large profits should plan for this as well. Here's a calculator from SmartAsset to use as a guide for what could be owed to the IRS. Exit strategies Take partial profits at price milestones Just as DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) is often used to build an investment position, setting specific price targets can guide scaling out when selling. What if you wait for Bitcoin to hit $150,000, but it peaks at $149,000 and then rapidly declines? Missing a price target triggers an intense emotional sense of loss, discouraging you from selling during a further decline. Avoid this psychological trap by setting sell orders while the asset value is still increasing. In the example above, targets could be set and triggered for partial lots at $1,000 price increments from $140,000 to $150,000. Trailing stop orders A trailing stop order automatically adjusts the sell price to lock in profits should the asset's price fall. This also removes the emotion from the sales process by automating the transaction, but requires careful setup to avoid premature triggers. Watch for the blow-off top A blow-off top is a sharp, rapid surge in price driven by intense buying pressure, retail FOMO, and speculative media hype. It often marks the peak of a bull market before a significant correction or an outright crash. Look for parabolic price increases, high trading volume, and extreme greed (> 90) in market sentiment. My price targets and timelines Since Bitcoin is currently at all-time highs, we are entering uncharted territory for the next cycle peak. Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, forecasts that Bitcoin could reach $250,000 by the end of 2025. In my view, that's possible but not probable. Many analysts favor a $150,000 target, which seems more realistic to me. In my view, timing the selling window is more crucial than predicting an exact price. Historical trends indicate the most significant price action will likely occur after early September, through October, and possibly into November. If we enter September and Bitcoin is already at $150,000, I will begin taking partial profits but allow the bull run to continue. If Bitcoin prints a massive green candle within this predetermined window, I'll take additional profits, as this may signal the blow-off top. Conclusion Congratulations on riding Bitcoin’s impressive 39% surge over the past three months, but as the market heats up, further preparation is necessary. Now is the time to craft a clear exit strategy, use every tool available to diligently monitor the market, and make sure all the prep work for selling is tested and completed. The process of planning when to take crypto profits not only prepares you for market peaks but also has the additional benefit of clarifying your investment strategies and objectives. Here's to a successful rest of the year, upcoming profits, and progression towards your overall financial goals.",BTC-USD,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-07-15 10:05:01

It built a huge base of loyal believers through a clean app, a social vibe, and the allure of easy crypto. But while Pi made users feel early, it’s still stuck in limbo. No tradable token. No full launch. A community waiting, still hopeful. The buzz may not be dead, but it’s quieter. And that’s exactly why so many Pi holders are now shifting their gaze toward a rising star that’s already delivering what Pi only teased. Why Bitcoin Solaris Is Winning Over Pi Users Bitcoin Solaris doesn’t just offer a vision. It’s executing on it. With real mining, real speed, and real rewards, BTC-S has created an environment that feels familiar to Pi fans, but turbocharged with serious blockchain power. What sets it apart? Mobile-first mining experience through the upcoming Solaris Nova App Active reward generation instead of passive waiting Cross-chain utility and smart contracts are already integrated Massive performance benchmarks with 10,000 TPS and 2-second finality For Pi users tired of watching and waiting, BTC-S feels like what Pi could have been if it had launched at full speed and with full transparency. This Time It’s Not Just a Boom It’s the Rise of Bitcoin Solaris The Rise of Bitcoin Solaris and Its Core Technology What makes Bitcoin Solaris more than just another altcoin is its sophisticated design. It combines a dual-layer blockchain model with a hybrid consensus system. The result? Lightning-fast speeds and ironclad security without energy waste.

Although the rally has recently slowed around the $0.72-$0.73 level, showing that upward momentum has momentarily cooled, yet the overall technical setup still remains entirely positive. Despite the recent ongoing consolidation, especially when viewed in the context of profit-taking across the crypto space. This sideways momentum in ADA seems more like a pause than a reversal. Also, the underlying indicators also point to more bullish momentum ahead, while the structure built in July remains intact, with support holding firm and accumulation patterns forming. ADA price may still have more upside to explore in the near term. Breakout In Cardano Price Chart Above Key Averages Signals Strength As it is evident that the ADA price has handled strong bearishness for months, being trapped inside this downward wedge. But, this time, ADA crypto breaching above its declining wedges was the biggest feat seen in a month on the daily chart. This breach has relieved many investors who were waiting for this moment in ADA. This move on the ADA price chart isn’t any ordinary move; it’s combined with multiple key factors, which have resulted in developing a crossover in its short-term EMA bands, specifically the 20-day EMA rising above the 50-day EMA. This signals the beginning of a sustained upward phase. Furthermore, the ADA price breakout and sustaining above the 200-day EMA is itself a key long-term indicator of a northward trend. As in the past 3 months, it struggled to hold above this dynamic level, but it is not the case anymore, and recent performance is evident, which clearly suggests a higher degree of resilience. Consolidation Near $0.72 Amid Market-Wide Sell-Off Despite the bullish signals, the ADA price is currently consolidating around $0.72. This pause aligns with a broader pullback in the cryptocurrency market, and Cardano has not been immune to this sentiment. As long-term investors began to realize profits, the Bitcoin, which recently hit an all-time high of $123.2K, dropped more than 5% to $116.7K. Nevertheless, this appears to be a healthy consolidation rather than a worrisome reversal, and it has not broken any critical support levels, yet. It is firmly suggesting that the uptrend remains structurally sound. Accumulation Phase Could Drive Next Leg Higher From a technical perspective, the current price zone between $0.70–$0.72 could act as a re-accumulation zone. Market participants may use this phase to regain strength before making another push toward $1.10, a psychological and technical resistance level. Moreover, another post offers further insight. A recent chart shared by Wyckoff Insider comparing ADA/BTC indicates that Cardano is currently pressing against a strong resistance level. According to the analysis, if accumulation continues and strength rises, ADA/BTC could flip the resistance level into support. Doing so would likely open the door to test the next resistance range in the ADA/BTC pair, which could indirectly support ADA/USD as well. $ADA / $BTC pic.twitter.com/LxLG4ZnrLe — Wyckoff Insider (@Wyckoff_Insider) July 15, 2025",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|ADA|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-15 10:08:49

This isn’t just a tale of lost money; it’s a profound narrative about trust, severe financial misconduct, and the perilous nature of high-stakes crypto futures trading. The individual’s actions have resulted in a staggering 15-year prison sentence, sending a clear message about accountability when public funds are at stake. The Startling Details of the South Korean NHIS Embezzlement Case In a case that has gripped the nation, a former finance team manager at South Korea’s National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) found himself at the center of a monumental scandal. The manager was convicted for embezzling an astounding 4.6 billion won, which translates to approximately $3.32 million USD. This wasn’t a small slip-up; it was a significant breach of trust under the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes, highlighting the severe legal repercussions for those who misuse their positions. The Supreme Court recently upheld the lower court’s stringent ruling, dismissing appeals from both sides and solidifying the 15-year prison term. How Risky Crypto Futures Trading Led to Disaster What happened to the vast sum of embezzled money? The answer reveals a stark warning about the volatility of speculative investments. After a mere 720 million won (about $520,000) was recovered through diligent civil lawsuits and account seizures, the remaining 3.9 billion won (approximately $2.82 million) vanished almost entirely. The culprit? High-risk crypto futures trading. For those unfamiliar, crypto futures allow traders to speculate on the future price of cryptocurrencies without owning the underlying asset. While offering the potential for high returns, they come with equally high, if not higher, risks. This individual’s foray into this volatile market proved catastrophic, turning a monumental theft into an almost complete loss, leaving behind a trail of public funds squandered. The Severe Consequences: What Does a 15-Year Embezzlement Sentence Mean? The 15-year embezzlement sentence handed down to the former NHIS manager underscores the gravity with which South Korean courts view financial crimes, especially those involving public funds. This isn’t merely a slap on the wrist; it’s a significant period of incarceration that reflects the scale of the theft and the profound breach of public trust. The legal system’s firm stance serves as a deterrent, signaling that such financial misconduct will be met with severe penalties. The public’s faith in institutions like the NHIS is paramount, and this ruling aims to restore some of that trust by demonstrating that justice will be served. Understanding Financial Misconduct: A Blow to Public Funds? This incident is a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities that can exist within even well-regulated public institutions. Financial misconduct, particularly when it involves public funds, erodes the very foundation of societal trust. It impacts not only the financial health of an organization but also the public’s confidence in its ability to manage vital services. In the case of the South Korean NHIS, an entity responsible for the health insurance of millions, such an act is particularly egregious. It highlights the critical need for robust internal controls, rigorous oversight, and ethical frameworks to prevent individuals from exploiting their positions for personal gain. This case should prompt all public bodies to review and strengthen their financial safeguards. Safeguarding Public Funds: Essential Lessons Learned The tragic outcome of this embezzlement case offers crucial lessons for financial management and oversight, particularly concerning public funds. Firstly, the incident underscores the inherent dangers of speculative investments like crypto futures, especially when illicitly acquired money is involved. Secondly, it highlights the absolute necessity of stringent internal audit mechanisms and regular financial reviews within public service organizations. Thirdly, fostering a culture of accountability and transparency is paramount. Employees must understand the severe consequences of financial misconduct, and reporting mechanisms should be robust and accessible. Ultimately, protecting public funds requires a multi-layered approach, combining legal deterrence with proactive preventive measures and continuous vigilance. In conclusion, the sentencing of the former South Korean NHIS manager serves as a potent, sobering reminder of the devastating consequences of financial misconduct and the perilous allure of high-risk investments like crypto futures. While the funds may be largely unrecoverable, the judicial outcome sends a clear, uncompromising message: the misuse of public trust for personal gain, particularly when involving such volatile ventures, will be met with the full force of the law. This case stands as a powerful cautionary tale for individuals in positions of trust and a call to action for institutions to fortify their defenses against such breaches.
