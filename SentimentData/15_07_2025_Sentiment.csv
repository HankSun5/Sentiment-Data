In his latest video update, the analyst identified ADA’s recent technical breakout as a clear sign of bullish momentum, forecasting a price target of $1.90 in the coming weeks if momentum holds. Cardano Bull Run Is Back On Investing Broz began the segment by reiterating the broader context: Bitcoin’s explosive rally above the $120,000 mark has reignited speculation around the arrival of altseason. “This is just one more egg in the basket of potentially altcoin season coming very soon,” he noted, citing Bitcoin dominance breaking below a critical support level and altcoins “going berserk.” Related Reading: Cardano Price Explodes 30% In Past Week — Analyst Calls $5 Next Market Top Among the altcoins leading the charge, Cardano stood out. The analyst confirmed that he purchased ADA in the past 24 hours, identifying the move as more than just opportunistic. The trigger? A confirmed breakout above a long-standing resistance level that ADA hadn’t pierced since March 1. “This is a major win for Cardano holders who are trading it,” he said, explaining that a falling wedge pattern had been developing for weeks and now signaled a shift in trend. Investing Broz’s trading group had initially positioned long at $0.54, with a modest target of $0.80. But as he emphasized, “Cardano is not just breaking above the smaller resistance level—we’re breaking above a resistance level we haven’t been back above since March.” That March breakout, he reminded viewers, was spurred by a now-infamous Donald Trump tweet listing altcoins deemed suitable for a proposed American crypto reserve. While that spike proved short-lived, the current breakout is, in his view, fundamentally and technically sound. To calculate a realistic upside scenario, he applied the traditional breakout target technique by measuring the height of the formation and projecting it forward. “This would give you a Cardano price prediction of $1.90,” he stated, while also noting that such a target might be ambitious for a summer timeframe. Still, “it’s absolutely doable and definitely something you guys should be keeping an eye on.” Related Reading: The Last Time This Happened Cardano Rose 55%, ADA Analyst Makes Bold The analyst reinforced his bullish outlook using confirmation from the LuxAlgo indicator suite, which flashed a weekly buy signal—featuring a green reversal, bullish momentum, and positive money flow. Based on this, he offered a more immediate price range between $1.00 and $1.80. “I don’t think we’re going to stop at $1.80, but I think it’s a target to keep an eye on if you’re looking for a trade,” he said. Beyond that, a golden pocket Fibonacci extension points to a key level of $2.42 by year’s end. However, Investing Broz was quick to clarify that these are not his full-cycle targets for ADA. “This is not my long-term bullish price prediction for this bull market,” he emphasized. “This is simply tradable movements that I still think can happen over the next couple of weeks.” His earlier predictions suggested ADA could hit $7 to $10 by the cycle top—possibly extending into 2026 or even 2027. Throughout the segment, he stressed the importance of knowing when to take profit. “Every bull market has volatility. Cardano… is going to have volatile movements where they rally and then pull back,” he advised. For short-term traders, targets around $1.80 to $2.40 may present ideal levels to secure gains or even explore short positions if momentum wanes. While ADA is not the only altcoin the analyst is tracking—Ono and HAR were also highlighted for similar breakout behavior—Cardano’s confluence of technical strength, historical resistance flip, and volume surge make it a standout in the current environment. As the analyst concluded, “There’s still time… this is a major breakout, and if you’re a trader, this is what you wait for.” Cardano, for now, has flashed its signal. Whether it makes good on the $1.90 target may depend not only on its own momentum, but on the broader timing of altseason’s long-awaited arrival. At press time, ADA stood at $0.7447.

When major economic blocs clash, the reverberations are felt across all asset classes, including the volatile crypto market. Recently, whispers of a brewing US Trade War have turned into a loud declaration, with the European Union signaling its readiness to unleash a massive wave of EU Tariffs . This isn’t just about goods and services; it’s about investor sentiment, market stability, and ultimately, the future trajectory of your digital assets. Understanding the Looming Threat of EU Tariffs The European Union, through its seasoned European Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security, Maroš Šefčovič, has made a stern announcement: a staggering 72 billion euros ($84 billion) in additional EU Tariffs are on the table. This isn’t a speculative threat but a calculated response to potential actions from the United States. The EU’s stance is clear: if trade talks with the U.S. falter, these tariffs will be imposed on U.S. imports. This substantial figure underscores the seriousness with which the EU views the escalating trade dispute, highlighting their commitment to protecting their economic interests. These potential tariffs are not merely punitive; they are a strategic measure designed to create leverage and deter aggressive trade policies from the other side. Historically, tariffs have been a double-edged sword. While intended to protect domestic industries, they often lead to higher consumer prices, reduced trade volumes, and retaliatory measures from trading partners. The EU’s proposed tariffs would target a wide range of American goods, potentially impacting various sectors from agriculture to technology. The specific products targeted are often chosen for their political or economic sensitivity, aiming to maximize pressure on the opposing nation. The Spark: The US Trade War and Its Origins To fully grasp the current situation, it’s essential to look back at the catalyst. The specter of a US Trade War was first raised prominently when then-U.S. President Donald Trump announced his intention to impose a hefty 30% tariff on EU imports, effective August 1. This move was part of a broader ‘America First’ economic policy, which prioritized domestic production and aimed to reduce trade deficits by making imported goods more expensive. Trump’s administration had previously imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from various countries, including EU members, and had threatened tariffs on automobiles, among other sectors. This aggressive posture ignited a series of tit-for-tat exchanges, where one nation’s tariff imposition was met with a similar measure from the other. The underlying philosophy behind such actions is often to force renegotiation of trade agreements deemed unfair. However, the practical outcome frequently involves increased costs for businesses and consumers, supply chain disruptions, and heightened uncertainty in global markets. The threat of a 30% tariff from the U.S. on EU imports was particularly alarming due to its significant percentage and broad potential impact across European industries. Key Aspects of the Initial US Tariff Threat: Targeted Goods: While not explicitly detailed in the initial announcement, such tariffs typically target a wide array of goods, from industrial machinery to consumer products, impacting various sectors within the EU. High Percentage: A 30% tariff is substantial, making U.S. goods significantly more expensive for European consumers and businesses, potentially reducing demand. Unilateral Action: The announcement reflected a unilateral approach to trade policy, often bypassing traditional multilateral trade dispute resolution mechanisms. Economic Nationalism: It underscored a broader shift towards economic nationalism, where domestic industries are prioritized, even at the expense of international trade relations. The Mechanism of Retaliatory Tariffs: A Dangerous Cycle The EU’s preparation of 72 billion euros in additional duties is a classic example of Retaliatory Tariffs . These are duties imposed by a country on imported goods from another country in response to the latter imposing tariffs on its exports. It’s essentially an economic tit-for-tat, designed to exert pressure and signal a strong response to perceived unfair trade practices. The goal is to make the initial aggressor reconsider their stance, but it often leads to an escalating cycle that can harm both economies involved. When one major economic power imposes tariffs, the affected party has several options: accept the tariffs, challenge them through international bodies like the World Trade Organization (WTO), or impose their own retaliatory tariffs. The EU’s decision to prepare such a significant package indicates their preference for the latter, aiming to match the U.S. in economic leverage. The selection of goods for these Retaliatory Tariffs is strategic, often targeting products from politically sensitive regions or industries within the aggressor nation, aiming to maximize political pressure. Potential Impacts of Retaliatory Tariffs: Stakeholder Potential Impact Consumers Higher prices for imported goods, reduced variety. Businesses (Importers/Exporters) Increased costs, reduced competitiveness, disrupted supply chains, potential job losses. Governments Increased revenue from tariffs (initially), but potential for reduced overall economic growth and political friction. Global Economy Slower trade growth, increased uncertainty, potential for recession. Why Do Global Trade Tensions Matter to Everyone? Beyond the immediate financial implications for businesses involved in import and export, rising Global Trade Tensions have far-reaching consequences that affect every individual, even those not directly involved in international trade. These tensions create an environment of uncertainty, which is kryptonite for economic growth and investor confidence. When major economies are at odds, it disrupts established supply chains, leading to higher production costs and, ultimately, increased prices for consumers. This phenomenon, known as inflation, erodes purchasing power and can lead to a general slowdown in economic activity. Moreover, persistent trade disputes can strain diplomatic relations, making it harder for nations to cooperate on other critical global issues like climate change, cybersecurity, or public health crises. The interconnectedness of the modern world means that a trade dispute between two major players like the EU and the U.S. can send shockwaves across continents, affecting emerging markets, commodity prices, and even the stability of financial systems. It’s not just about tariffs; it’s about trust, stability, and the fundamental rules governing international commerce. Consider the ripple effect: a company reliant on imported components faces higher costs due to tariffs. To maintain profit margins, they might pass these costs onto consumers, or they might seek alternative, potentially lower-quality, suppliers. This can lead to a decline in product quality or an increase in prices for end-users. Similarly, exporters facing retaliatory tariffs find their products more expensive and less competitive in foreign markets, potentially leading to reduced sales and job cuts. This web of consequences illustrates why Global Trade Tensions are a concern for policymakers, businesses, and citizens alike. Analyzing the Broad Economic Impact on Markets, Including Crypto The potential Economic Impact of an escalating trade war between the EU and the U.S. cannot be overstated. In traditional financial markets, such tensions typically lead to increased volatility, with investors seeking safe-haven assets like gold or certain government bonds. Equity markets often react negatively to news of tariffs, as they signal reduced corporate profits and economic uncertainty. Currency markets can also experience significant fluctuations as traders anticipate changes in trade balances and capital flows. For the cryptocurrency market, the implications are multifaceted. While often seen as a hedge against traditional financial instability, crypto assets are not immune to macro-economic shocks. In times of heightened global uncertainty, Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies can exhibit dual behaviors: Risk-Off Asset: Sometimes, Bitcoin acts as a ‘digital gold,’ with investors flocking to it during periods of geopolitical or economic instability, viewing it as a decentralized alternative to traditional safe havens. Risk-On Asset: At other times, especially during sharp market downturns, crypto can behave like a ‘risk-on’ asset, falling in tandem with equities as investors liquidate assets across the board to cover losses or move to cash. An escalating trade war would likely lead to a general risk-off sentiment across global markets. This could initially put downward pressure on cryptocurrencies as investors reduce exposure to all perceived ‘risky’ assets. However, if the traditional financial system shows signs of deeper distress, the narrative of crypto as a decentralized alternative could gain traction, potentially leading to a resurgence in demand. The key is increased volatility and unpredictability, making informed decision-making crucial for crypto investors. Potential Economic Impact Scenarios: Reduced Global Growth: Tariffs act as taxes, increasing costs and reducing demand, which can lead to a slowdown in global economic expansion. Inflationary Pressures: Higher import costs are often passed on to consumers, leading to rising prices for goods and services. Supply Chain Disruptions: Businesses may struggle to source components or sell products across borders, forcing costly reconfigurations. Investor Uncertainty: Ambiguity surrounding trade policies makes investors hesitant, leading to reduced investment and market volatility. Currency Fluctuations: Trade imbalances can lead to significant shifts in currency values, impacting international trade and investment. Navigating the Storm: Challenges and Actionable Insights The prospect of a full-blown trade war presents significant challenges for businesses, consumers, and investors alike. The primary challenge is the unpredictability of outcomes. Trade disputes can escalate rapidly, or they can be resolved through last-minute negotiations. This uncertainty makes long-term planning difficult. For businesses, it means rethinking supply chains, sourcing strategies, and market entry points. For consumers, it could mean higher prices and fewer choices. For investors, it necessitates a careful re-evaluation of portfolio risk. Key Challenges: Uncertainty: The fluid nature of trade negotiations makes it hard to predict the duration and intensity of disputes. Supply Chain Fragility: Globalized supply chains are vulnerable to disruptions from tariffs, leading to delays and increased costs. Market Volatility: Financial markets, including crypto, will likely experience heightened swings in response to trade news. Erosion of Trust: Trade disputes can damage international cooperation and trust, impacting future collaborations. Actionable Insights for Investors: While the broader geopolitical landscape is beyond individual control, investors can adopt strategies to mitigate risks and potentially capitalize on opportunities: Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider a mix of traditional assets and cryptocurrencies. Within crypto, diversify across different asset classes (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, DeFi tokens). Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on geopolitical developments and trade talks. Understanding the macro environment is crucial for making informed investment decisions. Follow reputable news sources and economic analyses. Risk Management: Implement strict risk management strategies. This includes setting stop-loss orders, avoiding over-leveraging, and only investing what you can afford to lose. Look for Resilience: In crypto, consider projects with strong fundamentals, real-world utility, and robust development teams that might be more resilient to market downturns driven by external factors. Stablecoins, for instance, can offer a temporary refuge during periods of high volatility. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility is inevitable, maintaining a long-term perspective can help weather the storm. Focus on the underlying technology and adoption trends of cryptocurrencies. A Compelling Summary: The Interconnectedness of Our World The EU’s readiness to impose 72 billion euros in Retaliatory Tariffs against the U.S. is a stark reminder of the delicate balance in global trade relations. What begins as a dispute over specific goods can quickly escalate into a full-blown US Trade War , casting a long shadow over the entire global economy. These EU Tariffs are not just numbers on a balance sheet; they represent potential disruptions to supply chains, increased costs for consumers, and a significant dampener on economic growth. The resulting Global Trade Tensions underscore the profound interconnectedness of our world, where actions taken by major economic powers reverberate across all markets, including the dynamic and often unpredictable realm of cryptocurrency. As investors, businesses, and consumers, staying vigilant and informed is paramount. While the immediate focus might be on traditional markets, the ripple effects will undoubtedly touch the crypto space, manifesting as increased volatility or shifts in investor sentiment. The ability to understand these macro-economic forces and adapt investment strategies accordingly will be crucial for navigating the challenging times ahead. The current situation serves as a powerful testament to the fact that no market exists in isolation, and the global economic health directly influences the trajectory of even the most innovative digital assets.

That’s why the merger between Synopsys and Ansys represents more than a significant milestone in Synopsys’ strategy to expand its reach beyond core chip design tools into broader engineering software. China approves $35B deal after U.S. policy reversal China’s top antitrust regulator has conditionally approved the $35B acquisition of Ansys by Synopsys. The approval by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) was confirmed on Monday, just days after the United States quietly relaxed recent export restrictions on chip design software. The merger between Synopsys and Ansys, two leading U.S. software companies, was first announced in January 2024 and had already received clearance from U.S. and European regulators. However, the SAMR paused its review in May after Washington imposed new restrictions that effectively barred U.S. chip design toolmakers like Synopsys from selling software to China. Synopsys’ CEO, Sassine Ghazi, had previously expressed optimism about closing the deal by the end of June. However, that timeline slipped due to SAMR’s pause. In early July, the U.S. government eased up parts of that restrictive policy as trade talks between the U.S. and China, which had been underway for months, reached an agreement in Geneva at the end of June. Companies involved in the negotiations confirmed that the policy changes were communicated earlier this month. According to people familiar with the matter, China’s commerce ministry urged the SAMR to resume the paused approval process shortly after the U.S. eased restrictions. The regulator responded swiftly, approving the deal on July 12, which was a single day after the process resumed. The SAMR’s conditions While China ultimately allowed the transaction, the SAMR imposed three main conditions to manage concerns regarding market concentration and ensure that Chinese companies are not unfairly disadvantaged after the merger. The companies are required to divest business lines where their offerings significantly overlap to mitigate the risk of monopolistic control in specific software markets. The SAMR also stipulated that Chinese customers must be allowed to renew their existing contracts under the same terms after the merger to save local businesses from sudden disruption or unfavorable renegotiations. Finally, the Chinese regulator mandated Synopsys to continue offering its EDA software to Chinese firms on fair and reasonable terms without bias in pricing or functionality. The regulator noted that Synopsys formally accepted these terms on July 11. Any failure to comply could result in penalties under China’s anti-monopoly law. Synopsys, headquartered in Silicon Valley, provides essential EDA tools and intellectual property used by top semiconductor companies like Nvidia and Intel to design and test their chips. Ansys, based in Pennsylvania, initially dealt with structural analysis software but has since become a major player in multiphysics simulation tools used in industries ranging from automotive and construction to healthcare and aerospace. Analysts say that the $35B deal reflects the growing intersection of semiconductor design and engineering workflows, due to the complexity of modern technologies like AI, electric vehicles, and industrial automation.

Recently, Bank of America (BoA), a global banking behemoth, released its insightful “On Chain” report, spotlighting Ethereum as a cornerstone in the burgeoning stablecoin sector. This isn’t just another report; it’s a powerful affirmation of blockchain technology’s increasing relevance and a clear signal of where institutional interest is heading. For anyone tracking the pulse of the crypto market , this development underscores the growing synergy between established finance and the decentralized frontier. Bank of America’s Bold Statement: Why It Matters for the Crypto Market When a venerable institution like Bank of America publishes a report specifically naming a cryptocurrency, it carries immense weight. Their “On Chain” report isn’t just a casual observation; it’s a meticulously researched document that delves into the mechanics and potential of digital assets. By highlighting Ethereum as a key player in the stablecoin market, BoA is effectively validating a significant segment of the digital economy. This recognition from a top-tier bank signals a maturing perspective on cryptocurrencies, moving beyond mere speculation to acknowledging their foundational role in future financial infrastructure. What does this mean for the broader crypto market ? Firstly, it lends credibility. For years, digital assets operated on the fringes, often dismissed by mainstream finance. Now, we’re seeing a shift where major banks are not only studying but actively acknowledging the utility and potential of blockchain networks. This can pave the way for: Increased Mainstream Acceptance: As more traditional institutions engage, the perception of crypto shifts from niche to legitimate. Regulatory Clarity: Bank interest often precedes regulatory frameworks. BoA’s report could encourage clearer guidelines, fostering a more secure environment for growth. Enhanced Investment Flows: Institutional validation can open doors for more conservative investors who previously shied away from the perceived volatility and uncertainty of the crypto space. This report is more than just an analysis; it’s a strategic indicator of the direction traditional finance is likely to take, viewing certain digital assets not as competitors but as integral components of a modernized financial ecosystem. Ethereum’s Unrivaled Dominance in the Stablecoin Sector The report emphasizes a critical statistic: over 50% of all stablecoins currently reside on the Ethereum network. This isn’t by chance; it’s a testament to Ethereum’s robust infrastructure, network effects, and pioneering role in smart contracts. But what makes Ethereum the preferred home for these dollar-pegged digital assets? Ethereum’s Core Strengths for Stablecoins: First-Mover Advantage & Network Effect: Ethereum was the first blockchain to offer a widely adopted smart contract platform, enabling the creation of tokens like ERC-20, which stablecoins utilize. This led to a powerful network effect, attracting developers, users, and liquidity. Security and Decentralization: As one of the most decentralized and battle-tested blockchains, Ethereum offers a high degree of security. This is paramount for stablecoins, which often represent significant value and require unwavering reliability. Vast Developer Ecosystem: Ethereum boasts the largest and most active developer community in the blockchain space. This ensures continuous innovation, maintenance, and the creation of tools and protocols that benefit stablecoin issuers. Interoperability with DeFi: The vast majority of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are built on Ethereum. Stablecoins are the lifeblood of DeFi, used for lending, borrowing, trading, and yield farming. This deep integration makes Ethereum the natural habitat for stablecoins seeking utility and liquidity. While challenges like high gas fees have historically plagued Ethereum, ongoing upgrades (like the transition to Proof-of-Stake and the development of Layer-2 scaling solutions such as Arbitrum and Optimism) are addressing these issues, further solidifying its position. The fact that the majority of stablecoin value is locked on Ethereum underscores its fundamental importance to the digital economy, making it a powerful force for stability and growth. What Drives Institutional Adoption of Stablecoins? The Bank of America report points to growing institutional adoption as a key driver for stablecoin expansion, which in turn benefits Ethereum . But why are traditional financial institutions, corporations, and large-scale investors increasingly looking at stablecoins? Key Drivers for Institutional Interest: Driver Explanation Efficiency & Speed Stablecoins enable near-instantaneous, 24/7 transfers of value globally, bypassing traditional banking hours and lengthy settlement times. This is crucial for cross-border payments and inter-company transfers. Reduced Costs Compared to traditional wire transfers or international payment systems, stablecoin transactions often incur significantly lower fees, especially for large volumes. Programmability Built on smart contract platforms like Ethereum, stablecoins can be programmed for specific uses, enabling automated payments, escrow services, and complex financial instruments without intermediaries. Access to DeFi Yields Institutions can deploy stablecoin holdings into DeFi protocols to earn yields that often surpass those available in traditional finance, creating new revenue streams. Hedging & Liquidity Stablecoins provide a stable, liquid on-ramp and off-ramp for crypto trading, allowing institutions to quickly move in and out of volatile assets without converting back to fiat. This growing interest from institutional players is a game-changer. Their participation brings not just capital but also a demand for robust infrastructure, regulatory clarity, and enterprise-grade solutions, all of which indirectly bolster the underlying networks like Ethereum that host these assets. The Future of Stablecoins: Navigating Regulatory Momentum The phrase “regulatory momentum” is a powerful one in the context of stablecoins. As Bank of America suggests, clear and consistent regulation is not a hindrance but a catalyst for widespread adoption. The current landscape for stablecoins is fragmented, with different jurisdictions proposing various approaches. However, a global push towards comprehensive frameworks is undeniable. Why Regulation is Crucial for Stablecoins and Ethereum: Consumer Protection: Regulations aim to protect users by ensuring stablecoins are adequately backed and transparently managed. Financial Stability: Governments and central banks want to ensure stablecoins don’t pose systemic risks to the broader financial system. Combating Illicit Activities: Clear rules help prevent stablecoins from being used for money laundering or terrorist financing. Fostering Innovation: Paradoxically, well-defined regulations can encourage innovation by providing certainty for businesses and developers. For Ethereum , the impact of regulatory clarity on stablecoins is profoundly positive. If stablecoins gain clear legal standing and operational guidelines, their utility and adoption will explode. This would translate directly into increased transaction volume, network usage, and fee generation for Ethereum, further solidifying its economic model and potentially increasing its value as stablecoin adoption expands, as analysts suggest. The U.S., EU, and other major economies are actively debating and implementing stablecoin legislation. The emergence of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) also plays into this narrative, as governments explore their own digital currency options, potentially coexisting with or influencing the trajectory of private stablecoins. Beyond Stablecoins: How This Impacts the Broader Ethereum Ecosystem While the Bank of America report specifically highlights Ethereum ‘s role in stablecoins, the implications extend far beyond this single use case. The increased usage and institutional interest driven by stablecoins have a ripple effect across the entire Ethereum ecosystem and the broader crypto market . Benefits for Ethereum’s Growth: Increased Network Revenue: More stablecoin transactions mean more gas fees paid to the network. With Ethereum’s EIP-1559 upgrade, a portion of these fees is burned, making ETH a deflationary asset over time. Enhanced Security: Higher network usage and value locked in stablecoins incentivize more validators to secure the Proof-of-Stake network, making it even more robust against attacks. Developer Magnet: A thriving ecosystem with clear institutional interest attracts more talented developers, leading to more innovative applications and services built on Ethereum. Value Accrual: As a foundational layer for such a significant part of the digital economy, Ethereum’s native asset, ETH, is positioned to accrue value from the growth of stablecoins and the broader DeFi landscape they underpin. Catalyst for Layer-2 Adoption: The demand for efficient stablecoin transfers on Ethereum pushes the adoption of Layer-2 scaling solutions, which will ultimately benefit the entire network’s scalability. The synergy is clear: the success of stablecoins on Ethereum directly contributes to the health and growth of the Ethereum network itself. This feedback loop creates a powerful positive cycle, cementing Ethereum’s status as a critical piece of the future financial infrastructure. Challenges and Opportunities Ahead Despite the optimistic outlook, challenges remain. Competition from other Layer-1 blockchains vying for stablecoin dominance, the ongoing need for scalable solutions, and the complexities of global regulatory harmonization are all factors that will shape the future. However, these challenges also present immense opportunities for innovation and collaboration within the crypto space. For individuals and institutions, understanding these dynamics is crucial. The insights from Bank of America provide a valuable lens through which to view the evolving digital asset landscape. It’s a testament to the fact that cryptocurrencies, particularly those with strong fundamentals and real-world utility like Ethereum, are increasingly becoming undeniable forces in global finance.

In a July 2 letter obtained by The Canadian Press , Chew asked to meet within two weeks, pointing out the order dates back to when a U.S. ban on the app seemed likely. He pointed out the directive followed a national security review conducted under the Investment Canada Act, which lets Ottawa examine any foreign investment that might threaten national security. “There is no upside to this outdated and counterproductive government order, which was issued under a different government and in a different era, and which doesn’t reflect today’s reality,” Chew wrote. When François‑Philippe Champagne was industry minister, he said the government acted to address “specific national security risks,” though he did not spell out what those risks were. Critics have pointed to Chinese laws that can force companies like ByteDance Ltd. to assist in intelligence gathering as the core concern. Tiktok challenges national security grounds Chew argued no evidence has ever been shown that TikTok poses a security threat to Canada, and he said officials have been unwilling to discuss possible fixes. He suggested steps such as stronger data‑security protocols, plus more transparency and outside oversight, could ease Ottawa’s worries. Last November, following a national security review of its parent company ByteDance Ltd., Ottawa ordered the Canadian subsidiary to be dismantled. Despite that, the app remains available to its 14 million Canadian users, but would no longer have any presence or representatives within Canada’s jurisdiction. Chew cautioned that enforcing the requirement would isolate Canada from its international partners, particularly those in the Five Eyes intelligence coalition, none of which have taken comparable measures. He added the decision appears rooted in “assumptions about TikTok’s future in the United States which no longer hold true.” The federal review began in late 2023 but remained confidential until March 2024, shortly after the U.S. House of Representatives approved legislation targeting TikTok unless ByteDance divested. In June, President Donald Trump again extended the U.S. deadline for banning the app for a third time. TikTok warns of major layoffs and investment cuts Chew warned that failure to intervene would force TikTok to lay off over 350 staff in Canada, halt direct investments here and scale back support for domestic creators and cultural initiatives. “The wind‑up process is rapidly approaching a critical juncture,” he wrote. He highlighted that TikTok’s Canadian staff have appeared before parliamentary committees, worked with regulators, trained law enforcement on lawful‑access requests and assisted Elections Canada during last year’s federal vote. “TikTok maintaining a presence in Canada means there is a local team who is accountable to Canadian policy‑makers and authorities,” he wrote. On July 7, the company said it would stop sponsoring major Canadian arts events like the Juno Awards and TIFF.A spokeswoman for the minister declined to comment on whether Joly has responded or intends to meet Chew. Separately, TikTok has filed a challenge in Federal Court against the shutdown directive, contending that Ottawa’s actions “bear no rational connection to the national security risks it identifies.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

48252595,https://cryptonews.com/?p=382090,1752535036,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/48252595.jpeg,"ChatGPT Predicts the Price of XRP, Pi Coin, and Dogecoin by the End of 2025",https://cryptonews.com/news/chatgpt-predicts-the-price-of-xrp-pi-coin-and-dogecoin-by-the-end-of-2025/,"OpenAI’s ChatGPT predicts that leading altcoins could establish new record highs in the second half of 2025, riding the momentum of Bitcoin’s explosive rally. Earlier today, Bitcoin rose to a new historic high watermark of $122,838, marking an all-time high with further gains appearing likely. If the momentum holds, global adoption could be just around the corner. This breakout has fuelled strong optimism among crypto enthusiasts, sparking speculation that an even more powerful bull market than the legendary 2021 run may be developing, with multiple top altcoins expected to achieve unprecedented valuations. Outlined below are several digital assets that OpenAI’s ChatGPT predicts hold substantial near-term growth prospects. XRP (Ripple): ChatGPT Predicts This Cross-Border Payments Leader to Double with Ease According to ChatGPT’s projections, Ripple’s XRP could climb to $20 by late 2025, which would equate to a nearly sevenfold increase from its current level around $2.99. This bullish scenario is driven by a combination of growing institutional usage, enhanced regulatory clarity, and mounting speculation about a potential XRP spot ETF that could unlock broader retail and institutional inflows. Additionally, XRP continues to gain recognition for allowing fast, affordable, and compliant international payments. In 2024, the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) commended XRP’s ability to facilitate immediate cross-border transfers without conventional intermediaries. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!! UN Endorses @Ripple and @StellarOrg as Cornerstones of New Global Payments Network! #XRP and #XLM will run the new financial system! pic.twitter.com/ufewexCKmR — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 13, 2024 A pivotal U.S. court decision in 2023 ruled that XRP’s retail transactions did not constitute securities, undermining longstanding SEC claims. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed in March that the protracted legal battle had concluded, removing a key overhang and bolstering market sentiment towards XRP and other altcoins. Looking ahead, the $3 resistance zone is viewed as a major barrier. If XRP can decisively break above its current level in the coming months, ChatGPT’s more conservative $10 target by year-end becomes highly plausible. However, reaching the more ambitious $20 price tag will depend on further regulatory advancements in the U.S. and stabilising political dynamics in regions such as the Middle East. Additionally, among major cryptocurrencies, XRP has been a standout performer, rallying 464% over the past year versus Bitcoin’s 100% rise. Pi Network ($PI): ChatGPT Predicts This Mobile Mining Project Could 10X by Year-End Pi Network has revolutionised the mining sector with its innovative “tap-to-mine” approach, allowing individuals to mine crypto directly from their smartphones without specialised hardware or technical expertise. From its current value near $0.4639, ChatGPT predicts that Pi Network could surge more than tenfold to hit $5 by the end of the year. Instead of resource-intensive mining, users earn PI tokens simply by opening the app and tapping daily – a mechanism that has proven especially attractive to newcomers in the crypto space. Launched in February 2025, $PI has exhibited significant volatility. In early May, it rocketed from $0.58 to $1.57 within just four days, a dramatic 171% gain driven by renewed institutional interest. Currently, PI’s RSI stands at 39 and is climbing, reflecting an underbought asset with strengthening bullish momentum as green candles sweep across the wider crypto market. If this trend continues, $PI may surpass its critical $3 resistance level this summer, setting a new record above February’s all-time high of $2.99. Thanks to its intuitive app and scalable Layer-1 blockchain, Pi Network is well-positioned to accelerate mass adoption, potentially reaching $5 even without a full-scale bull market, though broad user growth and regulatory approvals in the U.S. will be vital to achieving ChatGPT’s loftiest projections. Dogecoin ($DOGE): The Original Meme Coin Primed for a Major Comeback Finally, Dogecoin ($DOGE) , the first meme coin, maintains a robust market valuation of approximately $30.9 billion. Initially created in 2013 as a joke, it has since evolved into a legitimate crypto asset with widespread utility and a dedicated global community. Often moving in sync with Bitcoin, Dogecoin combines meme-driven volatility with surprising long-term resilience. Currently trading at $0.20 and showing little change over the past day, DOGE’s RSI is at 65 and trending upwards, suggesting accumulating buyer interest as Bitcoin continues its rally. Technical charts indicate a steep falling wedge pattern from November through April, signalling strong potential for a sharp upward breakout. ChatGPT predicts that DOGE could rise to $1.50 in a bullish market phase, representing a possible 7.5X return. On the adoption side, Dogecoin continues to receive strong corporate and celebrity endorsements. Tesla accepts DOGE for certain merchandise purchases, while platforms like Revolut and PayPal have integrated it into their payment offerings, strengthening its mainstream utility. TOKEN6900: Could This Emerging Meme Coin Deliver 1000x Returns? While ChatGPT remains bullish on established altcoins, their massive market caps often limit their explosive growth potential. For traders aiming for exponential gains, lesser-known meme coins might offer sharper upside. One such project is TOKEN6900 (T6900) , an ERC-20 meme token that launched its presale barely a week ago. Hey Siri, define aura pic.twitter.com/NVYT1pZmed — Token6900 (@Token_6900) July 8, 2025 TOKEN6900 has already secured around half a million dollars from early investors, reflecting strong market interest and the potential for a powerful launch rally. Unlike meme coins that attempt to pivot towards utility, TOKEN6900 embraces its identity as a purely hype-fueled asset, using irony, aggressive marketing, and FOMO to drive momentum. Its website boldly declares: “It’s Not Built On Fundamentals. It’s Built On Delusion, Irony, And The Collective Hallucination Of Terminally Online Traders.” Inspired by SPX6900, another meme token celebrating absurdist dot-com aesthetics, TOKEN6900 has a total supply of 930,993,091 tokens—exactly one more than SPX6900’s original supply, emphasising its competitive branding. This strategy appears to be resonating, as evidenced by its strong presale performance. While lacking inherent utility, holders can stake tokens for additional yield alongside speculative price gains. Interested participants can purchase T6900 via its official website at a current presale price of $0.006575. With prices set to increase within 24 hours, those aiming for the lowest possible entry point may wish to act promptly.

Simultaneously, numerous top-tier altcoins and the best meme coins —such as TRON, Sui Network, Solana, Pepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin—have recorded fresh highs in recent months, reinforcing the perspective that both sectors still hold substantial growth opportunities. As anticipation builds for the next major bull run, investors are zeroing in on select crypto assets that could potentially eclipse their prior all-time price highs. Ripple (XRP): Cross-Border Payments Crypto Arguably Price Performer of the Year Ripple’s XRP continues to strengthen its position as a key connector between traditional banking infrastructures and blockchain-based remittance networks. Its capability to allow near-instant global transactions at minimal fees has attracted notable institutional interest. The United Nations has even recognised XRP as a feasible solution for transferring funds internationally without reliance on traditional intermediaries. After enduring years of legal challenges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple secured a pivotal legal victory in 2023 when a court ruled that retail sales of XRP did not constitute securities transactions. The SEC officially dropped the case in 2025, ending the four-year litigation. This outcome solidified XRP’s standing within the industry, creating an important regulatory benchmark for the wider crypto market. Investor confidence surged following this development, driving XRP’s price up by over 464% within a year, outperforming Bitcoin’s 103% gain over the same period. XRP faces stiff resistance at its current level of around $3, but it’s likely to smash through this as arguably the biggest success story among the billion cap altcoins. Earlier this year, a bullish flag pattern formed across its support and resistance lines, suggesting the possibility of a surge towards $3.50 this summer, surpassing its previous peak of $3.40 set in January 2018. Pepe ($PEPE): Meme Coin Giant Targets Fresh Record Highs Pepe ($PEPE) has carved out its place among the top three meme coins, driven by the meme’s cultural popularity and strong market performance. Inspired by Matt Furie’s iconic cartoon frog, $PEPE has generated massive returns for early investors and now ranks among the top three meme tokens, with a market valuation exceeding $4.6 billion. pic.twitter.com/jR6ycgAYjc — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 9, 2025 Launched in April 2023, Pepe triggered a wave of copycat tokens, though none have managed to match its momentum or staying power. Its rise gained further traction when Elon Musk briefly adopted a Pepe-themed profile picture on X (formerly Twitter). Currently priced around $0.00001235, $PEPE has posted gains of 23% in the past week, although it is still approximately 56% below its all-time high of $0.00002803 set in late 2024, technical analysts observed a falling wedge pattern in Q1, a formation typically indicative of an incoming upward price breakout. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reached 65, indicating strengthening bullish momentum, suggesting limited further potential gains for $PEPE through the week as it is close to 70, which typically signals an over-priced asset, triggering a selloff. If macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions remain stable, Pepe may embark on another major rally before summer ends. Cardano ($ADA): Can This Eco-Friendly Crypto Set New Price Highs in 2025? Interest in Cardano ($ADA) is on the rise, bolstered by institutional backing and positive technical indicators. Like XRP and Solana, Cardano was named by Donald Trump as a possible reserve crypto asset for inclusion in a proposed U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Founded in 2014 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano is acclaimed for its research-driven development model and energy-efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus, which spurred Ethereum’s own transition from Proof-of-Work to PoS. With a market capitalisation of $27.4 billion, ADA would need to more than triple in value to surpass Solana and challenge Ethereum’s market dominance. In the last seven days, Cardano outperformed Bitcoin during the market-wide rally, adding 27% to its price while Bitcoin only grew 12%. Current projections suggest ADA could climb from its present price of $0.76 to nearly $2 by mid-year. More bullish forecasts anticipate a full recovery to its previous all-time high of $3.09, marking a rebound from its 75.5% drop since September 2021. Strong support levels and a bullish flag formation observed between November and April hint at continued upside potential, although ADA’s RSI has strayed into overbought territory at 72, which means traders will be doing a spot of profit-taking that could depreciate the price over the week. The next immediate level of resistance is at $1.15, but ADA enjoys strong support in the $0.85 to $0.90 range. Seeking the Next Explosive Altcoin?

The Spanish news agency EFE (via MSN ) reported that the Sumar group of MPs wants the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) to use the system for retail investors. The group says that the system would let users “clearly and visually” identify the type of asset they are purchasing. Sumar has sent a written proposal to the regulator. The group complained that a “significant portion” of tokens traded on crypto exchange platforms “lack material backing or any underlying value.” Spanish lending giant BBVA said it won approval to launch Bitcoin and Ether trading, integrating crypto into everyday banking. #BBVA #CryptoTrading https://t.co/ifB7FxuUV8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 10, 2025 Traffic Light Crypto Warnings Coming to Spain? The parliamentary group also wants to rename cryptoassets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) . It proposes using terms like “crypto bets” or “unbacked assets.” The lawmakers justified their request by explaining that coins “do not grant their owners any rights to tangible assets or have any connection to productive activities.” The traffic light warning system would see the CNMV apply one of three labels to each cryptoasset on an exchange or bank’s investing platform. The regulator would give a green light to cryptoassets that are registered, supported, and supervised. These coins would also need to demonstrate stable market performance. It would use yellow for cryptoassets that have “limited backing” or display moderate volatility. An orange light would identify “unsupervised” coins with high risk levels. And a final red label would be reserved for “speculative assets with no identified issuer or material backing.” Europe’s markets regulator criticized crypto oversight in Malta for falling short in several areas related to an unidentified entity it authorized https://t.co/BQrJYufB9B — Bloomberg (@business) July 10, 2025 Crypto Concentrates Wealth, Say Lawmakers Sumar said it is wary of “extreme forms of fictitious capital that do not generate value, but rather generate volatility, inequality, and wealth concentration.” Carlos Martín Urriza, the Sumar spokesperson for Economy and Finance, said policymakers should protect retail investors from assets that are not backed by a verified asset or collateral. Carlos Martín Urriza, the Sumar spokesperson for Economy and Finance. (Source: elDiarioes/YouTube) He added that crypto trading is often more similar to betting than to investing. Furthermore, Sumar wants the CNMV to force banks and exchanges to ensure their customers read pre-purchase information on cryptoassets before allowing them to buy coins. This should apply regardless of a token’s individual classification, Sumar said. It added that these mandatory warnings must be clearly summarized and contain visual elements. Sumar suggested that the CNMV use prominent warning systems. It said the regulator should base its models on those already used in sectors such as gambling or tobacco sales. Restrict Access to AI-powered Trading, MPs Urge Sumar lawmakers also want to create specific regulations for algorithmic trading pools. And the group wants to restrict retail investors’ access to trading platforms that use AI or algorithms.

One notable figure within the community, known as The5Blairs, recently presented a scenario in which the value of 10,000 XRP could grow to $33.8 million. This projection is based on a potential price increase to $3,380 per token. A Breakdown of the $33.8M Estimate At the time The5Blairs made this projection, XRP was valued at approximately $2.20. His analysis relied on the token’s transaction velocity and annual settlement volume. According to his findings, XRP facilitates around $1.3 trillion in yearly transaction value, with a circulating supply of about 60 billion coins and a transaction velocity of 10. He stated that with further expansion, especially through new partnerships and institutional adoption, XRP could potentially support between $100 trillion and $2 quadrillion in annual transactional volume. Based on that assumption, and using proportional valuation metrics, he estimated that XRP’s price would need to increase more than 1,500-fold from $2.20 to approximately $3,380 to handle that level of utility. Currently, XRP is trading around $2.98 , making 10,000 units worth roughly $29,800. Based on The5Blairs’ forecast, an investor holding this amount could see their investment grow dramatically if such projections are realized. Similarly, smaller holdings would still yield considerable returns, for example, 1,000 XRP could translate to $3.38 million, while 50,000 XRP might be valued at over $169 million in this scenario. Notably, Edoardo Farina , founder of Alpha Lions Academy, has consistently advocated for long-term holding, urging investors to maintain at least 10,000 XRP. He emphasizes the importance of patience, noting that the asset’s potential could reward disciplined holders significantly over time. Key Developments That May Influence XRP’s Growth Several factors underpin this price outlook. A significant one is Ripple’s extensive network of business relationships, many of which are formalized through non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). During Ripple’s legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it was revealed that the company had signed more than 1,700 NDAs since 2013 with a variety of banks, financial service providers, and technology firms. These partnerships suggest broader institutional interest that could translate into future adoption of the XRP Ledger. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another catalyst is Ripple’s growing involvement in the cross-border payments sector. In a statement from June 2025, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse noted that the XRP Ledger could eventually support up to 14% of SWIFT’s global transaction volume. Given that SWIFT processes an estimated $150 trillion annually, XRP could potentially account for $21 trillion in payment flow within the next five years if that target is achieved. In addition, The5Blairs emphasized the opportunity for XRP to play a role in the global derivatives and foreign exchange markets. With the notional value of global derivatives estimated at over $1 quadrillion, capturing even a small fraction could generate substantial demand for the token. Nonetheless, it remains uncertain how much of this market XRP can realistically absorb. Further reinforcing optimism around XRP is Ripple’s increasing presence in major financial infrastructure. Earlier in 2025, Ripple’s subsidiary, Hidden Road, became part of the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC)’s government securities netting platform. The DTCC processes over $2 quadrillion in transactions annually, and Ripple’s involvement through Hidden Road could indicate a gradual move toward integration. Recent DTCC patent applications mentioning Ripple and XRP have further fueled speculation, although no official announcements have been made regarding formal partnerships. While these projections are highly speculative and depend on several complex market variables, they reflect the growing confidence within the XRP community. Investors and analysts continue to monitor developments surrounding Ripple’s partnerships, market expansion, and potential use cases, all of which could significantly influence the token’s long-term value trajectory.

This comes despite all the buzz surrounding the technology. During a call with analysts on Monday, Lambert said stablecoins boast incredible technical potential — fast transactions, 24/7 uptime, low fees, programmability, and immutability. But those features alone don’t make them ready for everyday payments. He noted that people also need a frictionless user experience, broad accessibility, and consumer distribution. Mastercard eyes role as key infrastructure provider for stablecoin adoption Mastercard sees itself as the connective tissue between the world of crypto and traditional finance . Lambert emphasized that Mastercard can offer the kind of infrastructure — global acceptance, security protocols, and regulatory compliance — needed to help stablecoins scale and become useful at checkout. This vision isn’t new. Mastercard and rival Visa have been exploring stablecoin initiatives since at least 2021. Mastercard recently partnered with Paxos to support the minting and redemption of the USDG stablecoin. The company also backs stablecoins like FIUSD from Fiserv, PYUSD from PayPal, and USDC from Circle, signaling its long-term ambition to power the backend of stablecoin transactions. Consumer friction and low utility keep stablecoins from mainstream use Lambert notes that about 90% of stablecoin usage today is still tied to crypto trading, not consumer purchases. While companies like Coinbase and Shopify have made moves to enable stablecoin payments for everyday goods and services, significant barriers remain, particularly user adoption and checkout friction. Lambert highlighted that existing stablecoins do not presently offer a compelling use case for peer-to-merchant payments. He likened them to prepaid cards, with the ability for users to spend their wallet balance with some merchants, although the feature set is limited. Despite the common narrative being that stablecoins can be used to circumvent card networks and the transaction fees that are paid to process transactions, Mastercard and the rest are attempting to flip the script, presenting themselves as necessary allies who can help increase stablecoin utility by integrating them into established payment rails. Mastercard’s Chief Commercial Payments Officer Raj Seshadri added that stablecoins have hidden complexities. “You still need to convert to and from fiat. That adds costs — not just the price of the stablecoin itself, but also the FX, regulation, settlement, and ramping infrastructure.” Still others hold counter opinions. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller recently said that stablecoins will bolster competition in the payments system, and that was a positive direction. Speaking at an event at the Dallas Fed, Waller said that the rise of stablecoins will make many payments cheaper and faster. He noted, “And that’s the goal for me, as a free-market capitalist economist, is that I want competition in payments to drive down the cost for households, consumers, and businesses. That’s it.” With stablecoin regulation gaining traction in the US, banks and institutions increasingly weigh their role in this evolving space. Regulatory clarity is prompting some to explore offering stablecoins or deposit tokens to retain deposits that might otherwise flow into digital wallets. According to Lambert, every financial institution evaluates whether it needs to issue stablecoins and what the right product-market fit might be. For many, the focus is on avoiding a loss of control over customer deposits. Beyond the private sector, Lambert noted that governments and central banks are also taking a closer look at digital currencies, aiming to support innovation while preventing dollarization in their domestic economies. “We expect to see a wide range of approaches emerge globally,” he said. The crypto industry is moving closer to mainstream adoption as Congress advances a slate of pro-crypto bills this week. Dubbed “ crypto week ” by the Republican-led House, the legislative push includes a landmark bill to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, potentially heading to President Donald Trump’s desk for approval.

Here’s What It Means for Ripple,https://timestabloid.com/federal-reserve-implements-iso-20022-heres-what-it-means-for-ripple/,"The U.S. Federal Reserve has officially transitioned its FedWire Funds Service to the ISO 20022 messaging standard, a move that could significantly benefit Ripple, which has been ISO 20022-ready for years. Effective from today, July 14, 2025, all institutions using the FedWire Funds Service are now required to process transactions using ISO 20022 . This transition, originally scheduled for March 2025 but postponed to provide additional preparation time, marks a critical step in modernizing the U.S. financial system. ISO 20022 is a globally adopted framework for electronic data exchange between financial institutions. It provides standardized formats that support detailed and structured messaging. This not only enhances data clarity but also streamlines transaction processing, reduces errors, and strengthens regulatory compliance, especially for cross-border payments. By the end of 2025, projections suggest that over 80% of international financial flows will utilize ISO 20022. As adoption accelerates worldwide, it is quickly becoming the default protocol across the banking and payments industry. Ripple’s Early Adoption Gives It a Competitive Edge Ripple positioned itself early to capitalize on the global shift to ISO 20022. In 2020, it became the first blockchain company to join the ISO 20022 Standards Body. Since then, Ripple has aligned its infrastructure, particularly RippleNet, to meet the standard’s requirements. RippleNet supports structured financial messaging in accordance with ISO 20022, enabling seamless integration with traditional banks and financial entities that rely on the same format. This compliance enhances the platform’s speed, transparency, and interoperability, critical features for modern financial institutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Although XRP, Ripple’s native cryptocurrency, is not an ISO 20022 messaging token, it remains integral to RippleNet’s operations. XRP is primarily used in Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service, now known as Ripple Payments, which facilitates instant currency conversion and settlement, eliminating the need for pre-funded accounts. Implications for Ripple in the U.S. Market The Federal Reserve’s adoption of ISO 20022 could increase demand for payment infrastructure that already supports the standard. Ripple, having implemented ISO 20022-compliant messaging well in advance, is well-positioned to assist U.S. financial institutions through this transition. In addition to its technical readiness, Ripple is actively expanding its presence in the American financial landscape. The company recently applied for a U.S. banking license and a Federal Reserve master account for RLUSD, Ripple’s upcoming stablecoin. These developments suggest Ripple is working to deepen its involvement in the domestic banking sector. As more U.S. banks seek partners that can meet ISO 20022 standards, Ripple’s early adoption and proven infrastructure could prove advantageous, potentially driving greater adoption of its services across the regulated financial ecosystem.

Who’s Really Winning?",https://thecoinrise.com/while-subbd-builds-early-buzz-blockdag-secures-338m-expands-reach-with-seattle-sports-deals-whos-really-winning/,"The SUBBD presale has begun making the rounds, pulling in $750,000 and drawing early attention from altcoin fans. With a price still low enough to create buzz and growing talk around the next altcoin cycle, the setup is working in its favor. But while SUBBD builds early traction, another name has already captured the spotlight and a massive slice of the market. BlockDAG (BDAG) has passed $338 million in funds raised and locked partnerships with two professional Seattle sports franchises, taking a clear lead in visibility and execution. While SUBBD is still getting its footing, BlockDAG has already delivered measurable results and built out real-world connections. Early Days for SUBBD: Can the Hype Hold? SUBBD’s presale has reached $750,000, sparking growing interest among those watching for the next altcoin breakout. With a low entry price and strong community push, the project is starting to build traction. Market sentiment is leaning optimistic, and that’s helping more traders take notice of early-stage coins like SUBBD. The project claims it aims to simplify DeFi by offering a smoother interface, easier staking features, and a better user experience overall. These upgrades are part of what’s being promised in future rollouts, though most of the features are still in the development phase. As of now, much of the buzz is based on potential rather than working products. That hasn’t stopped chatter from picking up online. Social engagement is on the rise, and daily buy-ins are increasing, showing a steady uptick in early participation. Still, the project will need to follow through with real progress. For now, SUBBD is in the spotlight, but staying there will depend on execution, not just excitement. BlockDAG Delivers on Price and Partnerships! BlockDAG is pushing forward fast. The project has already raised $338 million, with 23.8 billion coins sold across multiple batches. It’s currently in Batch 29, where the regular price is $0.0276. However, as part of the GLOBAL LAUNCH release, buyers can still access a special price of $0.0016 until August 11. With the confirmed launch price set at $0.05, this gives users a chance to lock in a 3,025% return. Those who joined back in Batch 1 are already sitting on a 2,660% gain compared to the current launch rate. Beyond strong pricing and presale performance, BlockDAG is also scoring big on real-world exposure. The project has partnered with two professional Seattle sports teams, the Seattle Orcas and the Seattle Seawolves. These teams bring loyal fan bases and major league attention, helping BlockDAG reach audiences beyond just crypto circles. These aren’t shallow branding deals. They’re part of a broader push to build credibility, drive mass adoption, and make BlockDAG a household name in and outside of crypto. While many projects promise big things and stay in development mode, BlockDAG is already delivering results. From major sports partnerships to pricing momentum, it’s turning plans into action. The numbers, the strategy, and the visibility all show that BlockDAG is already ahead of the curve, and still climbing. Two Coins, Two Different Paths SUBBD is still in the early stages, and its low entry price is helping it gain attention. Early optimism is there, and the project could ride future market momentum. But hype alone won’t carry it forever. The gap between early buzz and long-term success is often bigger than expected. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is already making big moves. It has raised $338 million, sold 23.8 billion coins, and built partnerships with two major teams. This isn’t just about talking a good game, it’s real action, real numbers, and a growing base of support. Where SUBBD is working to build its name, BlockDAG has already carved out a spot. While both projects are on the map, only one has real traction right now. In this space, timing counts. But results matter even more, and BlockDAG has both. The Bottom Line SUBBD is seeing early success, and the price is drawing in attention. If the overall market stays positive, more people could jump into the presale. Still, it’s a wait-and-see situation, as the project’s promises are yet to be proven. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is all about delivery. With $338 million raised and 23.8 billion coins already sold, the project has momentum, and now, major partnerships with the Seattle Orcas and Seawolves to back it up. The GLOBAL LAUNCH release price of $0.0016, valid until August 11, makes it even more appealing. At launch, the $0.05 price locks in a 3,025% return. SUBBD is still trying to build its case. BlockDAG is already making its mark.

Currently, technical indicators, surging liquidity, and macroeconomic tailwinds have analysts predicting that the leading cryptocurrency is on the verge of a parabolic surge to a $140,000 top in the next few weeks. $140,000 Set As Bitcoin Next Top Target The Bitcoin price is exhibiting remarkable strength as it continues its parabolic advance beyond the $123,000 range. Technical indicators identified by crypto analyst Mr. Wall Street are now aligning around a new short-term target between $135,000 and $140,000. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices Are Surging Today According to the market expert’s chart report, BTC has successfully broken out of a Broadening Wedge pattern after consolidating between a descending support and horizontal resistance for nearly two months. The decisive breakout above the $112,000 resistance validates the analyst’s earlier bullish projections. Initially, the analyst proposed two possible scenarios: A breakout above all-time highs around $112,000 leading directly to a $117,000-$120,000 rally or a brief dip to $92,000 to fill the CME gap before continuing up toward the same target zone. Based on its recent price movement, Bitcoin has chosen to follow the first scenario, underscoring the strength of its bullish momentum and signaling that short-term Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) has had little to no effect. With the second scenario officially invalidated, BTC’s price trajectory is seemingly clearer and higher. The recent surge above $123,000 has also spotlighted the next major liquidity pool between $135,000 and $140,000. The chart highlights that reaching this zone would liquidate over $45 billion in short positions. Following this, the next target zone sits between $160,000 and $170,000, threatening another $70 billion in short liquidations. M2 Surge And MACD Fuel BTC’s Bullish Case Mr. Wall Street’s bullish setup for Bitcoin is further supported by macroeconomic and key chart indicators. The analyst pointed to US President Donald Trump’s recent approval of a bill to raise the country’s debt ceiling—a move that signals accelerating debt growth. This, in turn, is expected to expand M2 money supply, which historically correlates with rising prices for assets like Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Repeat Parabolic Phase From 2017 And 2021? Here’s The Target BTC’s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also remains fully intact across all time frames, while the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio is still well below historic top levels. In addition, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has yet to enter overbought territory. These indicators confirm that Bitcoin is still far from a macro top, making the $135,000 – $140,000 range a plausible interim target. Looking ahead, Mr. Wall Street emphasizes that Bitcoin has entered a supercycle, a phase where the market is marked by price discovery. While he acknowledges the possibility of a short-term retest of the $112,000 level before continuing upward, the analyst maintains that, regardless of minor pullbacks, the price action from here is likely to be swift and aggressive.

According to the NY Times sources, senior team members, including Meta’s freshly appointed chief AI officer, 28‑year‑old Alexandr Wang met last week to debate pausing the release of their most advanced publicly available model, Behemoth. The focus was instead on developing a proprietary version. Meta used to make its AI code public so other developers could build on it. A closed‑source model keeps the code private, but Meta argues that sharing openly speeds up progress and gives more people access to powerful tools. Switching to a private model would be a big change for Meta, which developers have praised for its open‑source approach. As recently as last year, Yann LeCun, one of Meta’s top AI researchers, asserted that “the platform that will win will be the open one.” Earlier this year, the Chinese venture DeepSeek leveraged Meta’s public code to create its own sophisticated AI chatbot, underscoring the tangible value of openness. Although Meta finished training Behemoth on extensive datasets aimed at maximizing its capabilities, sources report that the rollout was postponed after initial in‑house evaluations fell short of projected benchmarks. Following the inauguration of its superintelligence division last month, the Behemoth project considered a “frontier” effort at the leading edge of AI development, was put on hold pending further review. These talks are still early with no decisions made, and any change would need CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s approval. Meta could keep its public models while also building a private one. Either way, moving toward a private model would be a big strategic shift as it tries to keep upwith rivals like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic. In a podcast interview last year, Zuckerberg said, “We’re obviously very pro open source, but I haven’t committed to releasing every single thing that we do.” Meta’s new lab is under scrutiny after several AI missteps Meta has dealt with management problems, seen key staff depart, and launched products that didn’t catch on. Zuckerberg still wants to build an AI that achieves superintelligence, something some describe as beyond human thinking. To staff the initiative, Zuckerberg initiated an aggressive recruitment campaign, offering nine‑figure compensation proposals to lure leading researchers from OpenAI, Google, Apple, Anthropic, and others. Moreover, he reassigned the executive formerly in charge of Meta’s generative AI division. In June, Meta poured $14.3 billion into Scale AI, the company founded and helmed by Alexandr Wang. The deal granted Meta a 49 % equity share, and Wang, together with some of his key associates, transitioned into senior posts within Meta. Following the investment, Meta rebranded its AI arm as “Meta Superintelligence Labs,” with Wang stepping into the role of chief AI officer. He now leads an elite cohort of about a dozen recent hires, several Scale AI deputies, and Nat Friedman, ex‑CEO of GitHub. Sources indicate that numerous members of Wang’s group gathered at Meta’s Menlo Park headquarters for their inaugural in‑person meeting last week. They occupy a secluded office suite adjacent to Zuckerberg’s workspace. On Tuesday, Wang held a Q&A with about 2,000 AI team members. He said his core team’s work would stay private and that everyone in the AI division would now focus on building superintelligence. Looking forward, some AI employees anticipate that the upcoming vesting window in August, which will allow certain staff to liquidate company shares. It could trigger a wave of departures among those not selected for the superintelligence group. On Monday, Zuckerberg unveiled intentions to commit hundreds of billions of dollars toward AI compute infrastructure, aiming to have Meta’s inaugural supercluster operational by next year. In a Facebook update , Zuckerberg stated, “Meta Superintelligence Labs will have industry‑leading levels of compute and by far the greatest compute per researcher. I’m looking forward to working with the top researchers to advance the frontier!” He called the first supercluster “Prometheus” and disclosed plans for additional multi‑gigawatt installations, such as “Hyperion,” projected to reach five gigawatts over the next few years. Zuckerberg’s moves show he’s frustrated with how slowly Meta’s AI is progressing. After the underweheling response to Llama 4 in April, he is taking a different road to better compete with OpenAI and Google. “For our superintelligence effort, I’m focused on building the most elite and talent‑dense team in the industry,” he added, marking the start of a new phase in Meta’s AI endeavors.

Huang talked to CNN’s Fareed Zarkaria about AI as a positive force . He called it “the greatest technology equalizer the world has ever seen.” As Nvidia’s CEO noted in his paper, there will always be jobs, but AI is expected to alter working practices across every industry and profession. He said everyone else’s job would be 50% less than normal, but that didn’t mean there would be no jobs left for people. Work would change, not vanish, he argued. He said it is one example of how AI enables people who are (or aren’t) computer literate to become more productive. Huang mentioned the number of new users to ChatGPT, saying that even on their first try, they saw value in it. According to him, AI is just about the empowerment of people. On the other hand, Huang underscored that AI is a tool, not a weapon. Its filing times have gone from those built on specialized knowledge to becoming something AI should be able to handle in load times. He says the AI trend is not about devaluing human workers but valuing them more. AI will reshape the workforce with more opportunities Though the Nvidia CEO acknowledged that some jobs could be automated out of existence, he emphasized the potential for new opportunities. Huang said AI is not here to replace humans, but rather “to augment human capabilities.” He foresees new jobs in AI, from training models and engineering prompts to curating data, managing humans, and ensuring AI ethics. This is consistent with earlier shifts during the industrial and digital revolutions, when technology replaced some jobs but created many new industries and jobs. He added that AI was a “co-pilot,” rather than a competitor. Automation of repeatable and boring work can free humans from focusing on creative, strategic, and people work. He said this will improve health, education, financial, and agricultural systems. More crucially, Huang stresses the need for societies to retrain and educate workers to make this transition. People need to be educated to cohabitate and work with the AI, and riding the back of this dragon is the secret to a world and economy that spins ever upward. Nvidia challenges apocalyptic AI predictions Huang’s view contrasts with some of the more dystopian notes of the AI industry. In May, Dario Amodei, the CEO of the $61.5 billion artificial intelligence startup Anthropic, told Axios that AI might be able to strip half of all entry-level white-collar jobs from the global economy within the next five years. He warned that unemployment figures could climb double if the switch isn’t handled well, rebounding from 10% to 20%. In just a year, AI systems could write all the code a business requires, Amodei said. Some, such as Adam Dorr, an employee of the Wells research house RethinkX, believe that AI and robotics could automate away virtually all human labor by 2045. The transition will be difficult, Dorr told The Guardian, and there isn’t much time to get ready for the shift AI will herald. But Huang is still not caving to panic. He believes such doomsday scenarios fail to consider the possibility of AI as a force for good for humanity. “The effect of AI is not so much replacement but transformation,” said Huang. The AI revolution is being driven in no small part by Nvidia, which Huang heads. The company’s chips power some of the world’s most advanced AI models, such as the ones underpinning ChatGPT and other large language models. But Huang insists that such technology should empower, not replace, humans. As the world grapples with adapting its workforce for the era of silicon and artificial intelligence, Nvidia’s CEO offers a clear message: Don’t fear AI—use it to redefine the future of work.

This follows a week of strong gains, with BTC rising by more than 10% amid a broader uptrend in the cryptocurrency market. Despite the minor pullback, market analysts are closely monitoring on-chain and derivatives data to assess whether momentum is building toward a more aggressive phase of the rally. The recent surge has also benefited the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, lifting total global crypto market capitalization to just under $4 trillion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Records: What Miners and Leverage Traders Are Doing Behind the Scenes While Bitcoin continues to dominate in terms of volume and influence, sentiment metrics suggest that traders and investors may still be approaching with measured optimism. According to analysts, several indicators are now pointing to a potential shift in market dynamics that could influence Bitcoin’s next major move. Market Euphoria Not Yet Confirmed CryptoQuant contributor Joao Wedson has offered insights into the current structure of the Bitcoin market through an analysis of the price gap between spot and perpetual futures contracts on Binance. In a recent QuickTake post, Wedson noted that the spot price of Bitcoin continues to outpace the perpetual futures price, a sign that market sentiment has not yet tipped into full euphoria. Historically, a positive gap between the two markets has signaled increased speculative activity and the onset of parabolic rallies. “The gap is still in negative territory,” Wedson stated, “but the narrowing trend indicates that sentiment may be transitioning from cautious to more optimistic.” The analysis implies that traders in the futures market have yet to aggressively price in further upside, possibly waiting for stronger confirmation before deploying leverage. Should this gap flip to positive territory, it could be interpreted as a sign of increased risk appetite, potentially fueling a sharper upward move. Wedson also emphasized the importance of monitoring how derivatives markets respond in the coming days. “If the trend continues and flips positive, we could see a more intense phase of the rally driven by leveraged traders,” he wrote. Until then, the current environment appears to reflect a market in the process of building a foundation, rather than one that has already entered a euphoric phase. Bitcoin Profit-Taking Remains Measured In another analysis, CryptoQuant’s Enigma Trader examined the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), a key indicator used to evaluate the extent of realized profits by Bitcoin holders. According to the post, SOPR levels have remained moderately above 1 as BTC hit new highs, suggesting that some profit-taking is occurring, but not at a rate that disrupts the broader trend. The analyst observed that a spike in SOPR around July 3–4 coincided with short-term holders taking profits.

Republicans introduced a trio of bills to reshape digital asset policy, only to face sharp pushback from Democrats accusing them of favoring corporate interests over everyday Americans. The proposed legislation , comprising the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, was introduced in the House of Representatives to address data privacy compliance and future digital currency systems. GOP lawmakers argue the bills are crucial to maintaining the US’s competitive edge in financial innovation. However, during a heated Rules Committee hearing on Monday, Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern denounced the initiative as a “crypto giveaway,” slamming it as a misguided effort that ignores the risks of crypto-related corruption. “I have not had one person in my district come up to me and say, ‘please, please Jim, make it easier for crypto millionaires to get richer, please make it easier to con people,’” said McGovern. “Yet that is exactly what is going on here.” The remarks were a direct jab at President Donald Trump’s increased activity in the crypto space, including his family-linked company World Liberty Financial and its associated stablecoin USD1 (and his meme coin, Official Trump). GOP defends innovation push In a rebuttal, Republicans said the bill is meant to future-proof the economy and maintain US competitiveness in a fast-evolving cryptospace. The GOP’s tactics were also a central focus when committee chairman Rep. Virginia Foxx gaveled in the session. Foxx described the GENIUS Act as historic legislation, stating that it would help drive responsible innovation in the United States. She added that Republicans look forward to working with businesses nationwide to fulfill the Act’s promise. The GENIUS Act aims to oversee stablecoins by establishing comprehensive federal standards for issuers. The CLARITY Act addresses deficiencies in digital asset market structure, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act seeks to prohibit a US Central Bank Digital Currency that the government would use, many Republicans fear to surveil private financial activity. Republicans argue that over-regulation should not stymie innovation and financial freedom. They say the bills will advance transparency, offer legal surety, and guard against harm to consumers while also helping to spur growth in the digital economy. Critics, however, argue that the legislation doesn’t do enough to tackle fraud and abuse. McGovern said the bills opened doors to hucksters and market manipulation and were tilted toward rich insiders rather than average investors. Lawmakers struggle to build bipartisan support Republicans face an uphill task despite their enthusiasm. With a narrow majority in the House and no Senate control, the GOP may rely on Democrats to progress the legislation in both chambers. Democrats are not budging easily. Those conflicts of interest, tied to Trump and spread across government, alarmed Representative Maxine Waters and Senator Adam Schiff. Schiff cautioned of “ dangerous entanglements ” between crypto firms and elected officials. Waters noted that many components of the bill aligned with the goals of Trump’s crypto-backed ventures. She emphasized that the American people deserved policies that protected their money, not schemes designed to enrich political allies. Some Democrats also said the legislation diverted the House from urgent matters, like preventing national security threats and addressing economic inequality. And even as crypto comes under greater scrutiny for fraud and instability, most recently in the unraveling of FTX and ongoing enforcement actions by the SEC, some lawmakers are raising questions about whether it’s time to ease up on oversight. The discussion on Monday turned temporarily to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, dramatizing the extent to which the legislative calendar has become infused with tension and pressure. However, Republicans say they are committed to revisiting the crypto package before the August recess, which means they have just under two weeks to do so.

This slowdown may push authorities to introduce new measures to keep growth on track. To date, the globe’s second‑largest economy has avoided a big downturn, supported by a tentative trade agreement with Washington and the buffer of current policy measures. However, the sentiment among investors has turned cautious for the latter half of the year. This is marked by slow exports, persistent price declines and subdued consumer confidence. Forecasts suggest Tuesday’s release at 2 am GMT will reveal 5.1% annual growth in Q2, down from 5.4% in Q1, according to the latest Reuters consensus. “While growth has been resilient year‑to‑date, we still expect it to soften in the second half of the year, due to the payback of front‑loaded exports, ongoing negative deflationary feedback loop, and the impact of tariffs on direct exports to the U.S. and the global trade cycle,”said analysts at Morgan Stanley. They added that “The third‑quarter growth could slow to 4.5 percent or lower, while Q4 faces unfavourable base effect, putting the annual growth target at risk.” Beijing may announce more spending Morgan Stanley anticipates that Beijing may roll out an extra fiscal package ranging from 500 billion to 1 trillion yuan starting towards the end of Q3. June customs figures indicated a rebound in inbound shipments and a modest uptick in exports, driven by a rush to beat an early‑August tariff ceasefire deadline with the United States. Other June metrics on factory activity and consumer spending are forecast to decelerate further. Quarter‑on‑quarter, the Reuters survey predicts GDP will have risen by 0.9% in Q2, after a 1.2% gain in Q1. Furthermore, analysts expect growth to moderate to roughly 4.6% in 2025, falling short of official ambitions, and slip to around 4.2% in 2026. Investors are turning their attention to the late‑July Politburo session, anticipating cues on future policy moves and potential new economic support. According to the survey, experts foresee a 10‑basis‑point reduction in the People’s Bank of China seven‑day reverse repo rate, and a comparable decrease to the loan prime rate, sometime in Q4. Job market makes output cuts risky So far this year, authorities have stepped up public works funding and expanded household subsidy programs, while the central bank in May trimmed borrowing costs and pumped cash into markets to offset trade‑related headwinds. However, experts warn these measures might not be enough to stop the ongoing price drops. June’s producer price index plunged at a rate unseen in roughly two years, underlining persistent deflationary trends. Observers expect officials to step up cuts to excess factory production and look for new ways to encourage domestic spending. Analysts say it’s tricky to cut excess output without triggering major layoffs in a weakening job market. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Surprisingly, while Ethereum continues to dominate headlines, a growing number of savvy investors are shifting focus toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising star in the decentralized lending space that’s quietly gaining traction. The project is priced at $0.03 in the 5th presale phase, which is more than 70% sold. Those who invest in this phase will get a 100% return on investment after listing the token. More than $12.3 million has already been raised, with a total of more than 13,200 early investors. During presale Phase 6, the token will cost $0.035, and that represents 16.67% return on investments made in Phase 5. This could signal a broader shift in investor priorities beyond traditional blue-chip tokens. Ethereum Eyes Fresh Breakout Amid ETF Inflows and Upgrades The good news is that Ethereum (ETH) has recovered its position below the $3,000 level, trading about $2,948 and swinging in between $2,934 and $3,028, having achieved a 6-8 percent upsurge driven by the huge flows of ETFs and tokenization. Individual products at BlackRock, such as the company ETHA trust attracted an all-time high of $300 million in a single day, which adds to a combined $700+ million of flows into ETFs weekly as institutional players show renewed confidence in the DeFi and staking environment at Ethereum. The smart money is still around, but people are gaining more interest in some new DeFi projects, like Mutuum Finance. Presale Milestone: Mutuum Finance Hits $12.3 Million The Mutuum Finance presale has more than 13200 investors and has raised more than $12.3 million. Investors have picked up more than 70% of the tokens in phase 5. This indicates growing confidence of investors in the short-term success of the project as well as in their bright future. Mutuum Finance Launches Massive Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering $100,000 giveaway , divided into 10 winners of 10,000 MUTM tokens. In addition, the top 50 holders of the Mutuum Finance will be rewarded under its newly introduced leaderboard system. As the users level up they will be rewarded the bonus tokens. Transforming DeFi Lending: The Mutuum Finance Approach Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is transforming DeFi lending through the creation of a platform that renders customers the sole owner of their assets. It is a workable multifunctional double-lending system, which incorporates the synergy of both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. In P2C, lending pools are utilized via smart contracts. The platform is sensitive to prevailing market conditions in real time, an aspect that makes returns to lenders less volatile and borrowers financially stable. Through the elimination of intermediaries, the P2P model provides direct lending, which is particularly convenient on highly volatile assets like other coins. Over $12.3 million raised, 13,200+ early investors, and 70% of Phase 5 tokens already gone, Mutuum Finance is clearly gaining momentum as smart money rotates into high-upside DeFi plays. While Ethereum targets a modest move toward $4,000, early MUTM buyers are eyeing a 100% ROI at launch and an even greater upside as uncollateralized lending and dual lending architecture reshape the DeFi narrative. Phase 6 will push the price to $0.035, locking in a 16.67% return for Phase 5 investors. Add in a $100,000 giveaway and a leaderboard rewards system, and the case for Mutuum becomes even stronger.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As bitcoin (BTC) trades near $119,500, having just recently broken through another all-time high of $120,000 , digital asset investment products are also breaking records for inflows – but there's a regional disparity. According to CoinShares, U.S.-listed funds dominated with $3.74 billion in inflows, while Germany saw $85.7 million in outflows, underscoring a growing divergence in global institutional sentiment. This robust institutional appetite in the U.S. is exemplified by Vanguard’s evolving stance on crypto investments. Despite once branding bitcoin as an ""immature asset class,"" the $10 trillion asset manager is now Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy (MSTR)'s largest shareholder, indirectly becoming the most significant Bitcoin holder in traditional finance, as Presto Research recently noted in a d aily markets update. Meanwhile, QCP Capital highlights in a recent note that institutional enthusiasm remains notably robust, exemplified by over $2 billion net inflows into spot BTC ETFs last week. Yet, derivatives markets suggest a more nuanced approach. Leveraged long positions are expanding aggressively, with perpetual funding rates approaching an elevated 30% and open interest surpassing $43 billion, levels unseen since BTC reclaimed $100k in January. Such aggressive positioning raises caution flags, recalling February's abrupt $2 billion liquidation event. “Froth is building,” QCP warns. BTC Continues to Outpace Luxury Watches Bitcoin (BTC) is up 27.87% year-to-date and 13.22% in the past month, easily outperforming the luxury watch market’s modest +4.5% rebound in Q2, according to a recent report co-authored by Morgan Stanley and WatchCharts. Gains were concentrated in flagship models, Daytona, Nautilus, Royal Oak, while brands like Panerai, Breitling, and IWC underperformed. Inventory for watches under $5,000 remains historically elevated, and dealer turnover in that range continues to lag. “Price recovery remains narrow and concentrated,” the report notes, driven by “renewed interest from high-end collectors and improved global risk appetite.” Both BTC and watches, it adds, tend to benefit from “expansionary monetary environments and periods of wealth creation.” But the speculative capital isn’t flowing evenly. Bitcoin has attracted more of the macro-driven bid, with institutional inflows and 24/7 liquidity making it the preferred high-beta asset. The pandemic-era correlation between BTC and watches, both beneficiaries of easy money and speculative excess, broke down in late 2023 with the approval of U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs. BTC has since matured into a macro-sensitive, institutionally backed asset, while watches have returned to their roots: fashion. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin briefly approached $123,000 before cooling off, while crypto-related stocks held modest gains and analysts said the market remains far from euphoric, with one projecting BTC’s $2.5 trillion market cap could eventually converge with gold’s $22 trillion. ETH: ETH surged past $3,079 in early trading on strong volume before retreating in the afternoon to settle near $3,011, forming a textbook breakout-pullback pattern with support holding above the key $3,000 level. Gold: Gold slipped 0.1% after hitting a three-week high amid renewed tariff threats from President Trump and focus on trade talks and U.S. data, while silver surged to its highest level since September 2011. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets opened mixed Tuesday, with investors brushing off President Trump’s tariff shifts and turning attention to upcoming Chinese economic data, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 remained flat. S&P 500: RBC Capital Markets raised its 2025 S&P 500 target to 6,250 from 5,730, but unlike Goldman and BofA, it expects little upside from current levels, with the index already above 6,280 as of July 11.

Overall retail sales rose 3.1% compared with a year ago, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said. The upturn was largely the result of warmer weather, which had prompted Britons to spend more on electric fans, sports, and leisure equipment. The bright weather also moved consumers out of doors, increasing spending on seasonal goods . The BRC’s Chief Executive, Helen Dickinson, said that food and non-food performances were good. “Retail sales heated up in June, with both food and non-food performing well,” she said. “Food sales remained strong, though this was partly driven by food inflation, which has risen steadily over the year.” Food sales alone rose 4.1% while non-food purchases rose 2.2%, overturning the retail sector’s drag on gross domestic product in May. Economic uncertainty and increased cost of living have made consumers tighten their belts this month. Businesses regain confidence The increase in retail spending is the latest in a series of indicators that point to the possibility that the UK economy is recovering after a weak spring. The economy shrank in April and May, the first consecutive contraction in economywide activity since 2009, as the country reeled from a combination of domestic and international forces, ranging from newly imposed tariffs by the United States to a hike in corporate taxes, and a national minimum wage that was raised that prompted businesses to pare back hiring and payroll costs. But the climate for business is improving. A purchasing managers’ index (PMI) published earlier this month indicated that private sector activity expanded quickly by nine months in June. That is for all of manufacturing and services. At the same time, a recent Bank of England survey showed that companies are ready to start taking on new staff again, which is good news for employment and consumer spending in the future. The survey found that companies planned to add to payrolls in the next 12 months by 1.1%, a sharp rebound compared to how cautiously the nation’s businesses began the year. Research fellow Paul Dales said in a note to investors that there was evidence to suggest the worst of the economic downturn had passed and that conditions were likely to improve. He added that although the recovery remained tentative, recent data indicated that confidence was returning in key sectors of the economy. Starmer leverages retail bounce for political relief The brighter economic horizon could not have come at a better time for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has been under pressure to produce results soon after assuming office . His administration has its hands full: from cost-of-living complaints to low productivity and slow growth. The recovery in retail sales, rising business confidence, and better labor market expectations offer a respite. It could give his administration the political room it requires to launch new reforms and investment plans without overshadowing a worsening recession. However, caution still abounds; amid ongoing global uncertainty, rising food prices, and potential interest rate changes from the Bank of England, economists said the trend indicates the UK could miss a prolonged recession. For Starmer, it may represent a narrow window of opportunity to cement public backing and stabilize the economy. Should these green shoots continue to flourish during the remainder of the summer and into the autumn, the UK could end 2025 with a stronger base for its economy than many dared to believe possible earlier this year.

According to on-chain data from Artemis and deBridge, more than $125 million worth of assets have been bridged into Solana from other blockchains in the last seven days. REPORT: In the last 7 days, over $125 million bridged from other chains to @Solana , including $70 million+ from Ethereum alone. (A growth of nearly 40% compared to last week) pic.twitter.com/jMVTiJZ8jr — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) July 14, 2025 Ethereum Fuels $70M Liquidity Wave Into Solana as Meme Coin Hype Cools Solana is experiencing a major liquidity revival, driven primarily by Ethereum, as the volume of bridged assets surges. According to data from Artemis, Ethereum accounted for over $70 million in inflows into Solana, representing nearly 56% of the total. Arbitrum followed with $14.1 million, while Polygon and BNB Chain contributed $7.5 million and $2.6 million, respectively. Other smaller chains made up the remaining $4.2 million. The total bridged volume into Solana rose by almost 40% week-over-week, with the Ethereum-to-Solana route emerging as the most dominant pipeline. Data from deBridge further confirms that $31 million in assets flowed from Ethereum to Solana alone. Source: solscan Much of this capital shift appears linked to a cooling off in the once-explosive meme coin launching frenzy. While Solana had previously seen a massive surge in new token launches, last week saw only 322,000 new token launches, a sharp slowdown compared to earlier peaks. This trend indicates a move back toward established projects and tokens. Interestingly, even during the heated rivalry between LetsBONK and Pump.fun, token activity remained relatively muted. LetsBONK graduated 1,243 tokens, double Pump.fun’s 622, and also launched 130,605 new tokens, significantly ahead of Pump.fun’s 77,250. Amid a slowdown in new meme coin launches, several older and more established Solana-based meme tokens are seeing renewed interest. Traders appear to be redirecting liquidity toward more recognizable assets, including Pepe ( PEPE ), Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Bonk ( BONK ), and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) , signaling a shift from novelty to familiarity. Source: Cryptonews PEPE has recorded a notable 23.73% increase in market capitalization over the past seven days and is now trading at $0.00001217. The token’s 24-hour trading volume stands at $5.87 billion, up 78.50% from the previous day. This surge in volume reflects a spike in market activity. As of today, PEPE’s market capitalization is $5.12 billion. Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), the second-largest meme token by market value, is also gaining traction. The token is currently trading at $0.00001329, up 14.9% over the past week and 0.6% in the last 24 hours. SHIB’s market capitalization is now $7.83 billion, ranking it 23rd in token market cap. Dogecoin ( DOGE ), the largest meme coin by market cap, is currently trading at $0.1982. It has risen 18.5% over the past seven days, reaching over $8.06 billion in market cap. Bonk ( BONK ) has captured significant market attention, with its price climbing 70% over the last 10 trading sessions. The token is currently priced at $0.00002719, reflecting a 6.27% increase in the past 24 hours. BONK’s market cap has climbed to $1.465 billion after gaining 33.9% in the past week. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) has also experienced a sharp resurgence. The token jumped 48.2% in the last seven days, lifting its market capitalization to $1.918 billion. The sudden momentum was amplified by a surprise social media endorsement from TRON founder Justin Sun, further fueling investor interest. Together, these developments point to a broader trend of capital rotation back into familiar meme coins, as traders seek stability and momentum within the increasingly saturated meme token market. Solana Tops Q2 Revenue at $271M, Outpaces Ethereum, Bitcoin & Tron Meanwhile, Solana itself continues to outshine its peers in core metrics. The blockchain generated over $271 million in revenue in Q2 2025, outpacing Ethereum, Tron, and Bitcoin for the third consecutive quarter, according to Blockworks.

Active addresses rose to 24.4 million, and fee revenue increased 44% to $7.68 million. Adding to the momentum is the anticipation around Solana ETFs. Polymarket data shows that traders now estimate a 99% chance that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot Solana ETF by the end of 2025. Bloomberg ETF analysts have sharply raised expectations for US approval of spot funds tracking Solana, Litecoin, and XRP. #ETFs #XRP https://t.co/dKK2ZIbW8c — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 1, 2025 Several major firms, including VanEck, Grayscale, 21Shares, and Bitwise, have already filed applications, signaling deep institutional interest. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart echoed the sentiment, saying , “We’re expecting a wave of new ETFs in the second half of the year. Solana is clearly leading that conversation.” Notably, Solana ( SOL ) is currently trading at $162.19, up 9.5% over the past 7 days. The token has also seen a sharp rise in trading activity, with 24-hour volume hitting $14.4 billion, a 133.4% increase from the previous day. Source: Cryptonews On July 12, analyst Ali Martinez shared a bullish outlook on Solana, highlighting a cup-and-handle pattern forming on the weekly chart, a classic bullish signal that often precedes major rallies. This is a critical level for Solana $SOL . A weekly close above $170 could ignite the next major bull run and open the gates to $2,000! pic.twitter.com/JjTaRdUL4h — Ali (@ali_charts) July 12, 2025 The pattern suggests that Solana has recovered from its past lows near $9.88, following a multi-year climb from its previous peak around $250. The recent price action appears to be forming the “handle” portion of the structure. Martinez points to $170 as a critical resistance level. A confirmed breakout above this level, particularly with a weekly close, could validate the pattern and trigger a strong upward move. Based on Fibonacci projections, potential price targets include $295 (a retest of the all-time high), with longer-term targets of $787, $1,314, and even $2,744. However, failure to break past $170 may lead to a pullback toward $135 or even $100, which has historically acted as strong support.

According to data from sources, Coinbase’s stock ended up 1.8% at $394.01 per share on the day. At the same time, shares hit a peak of $398.50. At today’s closing price, Coinbase has a market cap of nearly $100.36 billion, the highest market cap the crypto exchange has recorded in history. Bitwise CIO anticipates Coinbase becoming a trillion-dollar company at some point Coinbase shares have popped 50% in the past month alone in conjunction with the highly successful initial public offering (IPO) of Circle Internet Group and favorable regulatory changes in the United States. The crypto exchange also encountered a significant achievement on May 19 after adding it to the S&P 500 index. This milestone distinguishes Coinbase as the first cryptocurrency-focused company to gain entry into this benchmark, highlighting its growing legitimacy within the financial sector. This month, Coinbase experienced a steady increase in revenue that did not come from transactions in the last year, totaling $772 million in the first three months, according to analysis from sources. Last week, the company brought on a user named AlexOnchain to help increase its social media presence. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan had previously forecasted Coinbase’s significant milestone. Based on his anticipation, the firm could eventually become a trillion-dollar company. On May 13, in an X Post , Hougan advised investors to choose a company currently worth less than $100 billion but has the best chance of reaching a value of over $1 trillion . He gave Coinbase as an example, which is valued at $61 billion. Coinbase’s stock rebounds amid growing adoption of cryptocurrencies On June 26, Coinbase’s shares had also experienced a surge, closing at a record high in a rally that increased the embrace of cryptocurrencies on Wall Street and Washington. This came after the stock of the crypto exchange operator jumped 5.5% to $375.07. That surpasses the previous peak of $357.39 in November 2021, only a few months after the company became public with a direct listing. Notably, Coinbase shares have soared more than 1,000% from a record low in late 2022, when the failure of FTX had cast further doubt on the digital asset’s future. The stock’s rebound came as cryptocurrency prices recovered, and the industry itself secured powerful new allies, including President Trump, a strong crypto supporter who has embraced crypto stances in the US. Another important milestone that contributed to the crypto exchange’s share surge was after the US Senate approved legislation for stablecoins pegged to the dollar, which are considered a promising payment method. Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer highlighted the significance of stablecoins in the company’s operations. According to him, revenues generated from stablecoins will probably enable the company to reduce its dependence on trading revenue, which is under pressure from competition. Following trade analysis, Coinbase’s main source of revenue has emerged from stablecoins. Therefore, with these new regulations, the crypto exchange will achieve financial stability and continuous success. Republican House leaders are preparing to pass a stablecoin regulatory bill this week, aiming to send Congress’s first major piece of digital asset legislation to the president’s desk. The vote marks the beginning of what supporters are calling “Crypto Week” — a series of decisions that could reshape the crypto landscape in the US. The proposed legislation, backed by industry leaders, is expected to bolster the adoption of dollar-based stablecoins. If passed, it would represent a significant win for crypto proponents, who collectively invested hundreds of millions of dollars during the last election cycle to help install lawmakers favorable to digital asset innovation, according to Federal Election Commission data. “The golden age of digital assets is here,” said Rep. Bryan Steil (R-WI), a key industry ally and chair of the House crypto subcommittee. President Donald Trump, now prioritizing digital asset regulation in his second term, has vowed to make the United States the “crypto capital” of the world. His family’s involvement in crypto ventures — which has reportedly earned them hundreds of millions of dollars — has drawn criticism from Democrats, some of whom have pushed, unsuccessfully, to include prohibitions targeting Trump-affiliated crypto businesses in the legislation. The House is also set to vote this week on two additional industry-supported bills: one to establish comprehensive market structure rules for cryptocurrencies, and another to block the Federal Reserve from launching a digital currency.

Crypto Capital Inflows Are Currently Sitting At $51 Billion As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, there is a stark difference in capital participation between the current Bitcoin rally and the one from December 2024. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $118,000—But Liquidity Still Thin, Glassnode Warns Below is the chart shared by the analyst that compares the two bull runs. The graph captures the 30-day capital flows occurring for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the stablecoins. For the former two assets, it tracks them using the Realized Cap indicator. The Realized Cap is a capitalization model that calculates a given cryptocurrency’s total value by assuming that each coin in the circulating supply has its value equal to the last time it changed hands on the network. In short, what the metric represents is the amount of capital that investors of the asset as a whole have put into it. Changes in this indicator, therefore, correspond to the entry or exit of capital into the network. As is visible in the chart, the 30-day Realized Cap change for Bitcoin and Ethereum (colored in orange) has gone up alongside the latest price rally, indicating that capital has flowed into these coins. It’s also apparent that stablecoin flows (blue) have also noted an uptick, although the scale has been smaller. For stables, capital flow can be directly measured using the market cap, since their price is always pegged to $1 means that the Realized Cap never differs from the market cap. In the cryptocurrency sector, capital mainly comes in through three entry points: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins. The altcoins usually only receive a rotation of capital from these assets. Since the flows related to the three have recently been positive, the market as a whole has been getting an injection of capital. In total, the aggregate capital inflows for the cryptocurrency sector have stood at $51.2 billion for the past month. This is certainly a sizeable figure on its own, but it pales in comparison to what was witnessed before. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Breaks 8-Year Resistance Line That Failed In 2017-2021 As Martinez has highlighted in the chart, the monthly capital flows peaked at almost $135 billion in the December 2024 Bitcoin rally above $100,000, more than double the latest number. Something to keep in mind, however, is the fact that the previous run was more explosive, while the latest one has come in two waves: an initial recovery surge above $100,000 that led into a consolidation phase and the current breakout into the $120,000 levels. This could, at least in part, explain why the metric has appeared relatively cool recently. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $121,700, up nearly 3% over the last 24 hours.

Dolce & Gabbana USA Was Not Behind Failed NFT Project According to a July 11 ruling from Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald of the Southern District of New York, Dolce & Gabbana USA Inc. is cleared from the high-profile litigation as it is not an “alter ego” of its parent company, Dolce & Gabbana SRL, which was in charge of the NFT-focused “DGFamily” project. “The Court finds that plaintiff has not adequately alleged that D&G S.R.L. completely dominated D&G USA even if D&G S.R.L. allegedly shared some employees and office space with D&G USA,” the filing states in part. “For the foregoing reasons, D&G USA’s motion is granted,” Reice concludes. DGFamily NFT Project Slammed As Rug Pull In Lawsuit Filed in May and amended in September 2024 , the lawsuit alleges that Dolce & Gabbana US and its Italian counterpart abandoned the “DGFamily” NFT project and failed to deliver on the mission’s promises while retaining customer funds. According to the Dolce & Gabbana website, “DGFamily” supposedly provided access to exclusive drops and collaborations, digital wearables, physical products, and events hosted by the company. However, the litigation implies that the iconic fashion house’s digital asset venture was nothing more than a classic “rug pull.” 1/ Dolce&Gabbana and @UNXD_NFT announce the highly anticipated launch of the DGFamily community. 3 distinct Boxes + digital, physical, & experiential benefits that take holders on a journey between real life & the metaverse. https://t.co/JMmmWZuRPu https://t.co/sCWuIQSwnD pic.twitter.com/r5t0M3FfBs — Dolce & Gabbana (@dolcegabbana) February 21, 2022 “Each of Defendants’ misrepresentations and omissions were material because they were designed to, and did, entice the public into purchasing unregistered securities (DGFamily Products) which were barely more than a vehicle for the Defendants’ enrichment,” the lawsuit reads. “Either through reckless incompetence or greed, Defendants failed to deliver what they promised in exchange for purchasing their digital assets and abandoned their crypto project while retaining over $25 million used to fund the project,” it continues.

In a statement on its website, the California‑based maker of AI hardware stated that it has already applied to the US Commerce Department for the needed licenses to continue H20 shipments. Management expects approval “soon,” and said deliveries to Chinese buyers will follow quickly once the paperwork is complete. Alongside the resumption plan, Nvidia introduced an RTX Pro graphics processor that it calls “fully compliant” with current regulations. The chip is aimed at digital‑twin artificial‑intelligence work in smart factories, logistics hubs, and other industrial settings inside China. Chief Executive Jensen Huang has been trying to keep doors open in both Washington and Beijing. The company noted that Huang recently met Trump and several lawmakers in the capital before traveling to China for talks with officials there. The meetings, Nvidia said, were meant to promote cooperation on AI research and to underline the firm’s open‑source support. Hints of a scaled‑down H20 for China first surfaced in May. Nvidia had been preparing a scaled-down version to satisfy US export curbs on advanced semiconductors and chips. Those curbs had blocked the original H20 from being shipped to Beijing.. Nvidia had previously lost access to $50 billion China market During Nvidia’s last earnings call, Huang painted a bleak picture of the impact of US curbs on its shipments. “The fifty‑billion‑dollar China market is effectively closed to U.S. industry,” he told analysts. “As a result, we are taking a multibillion‑dollar writeoff on inventory that cannot be sold or repurposed.” The pressure intensified in April. According to Nvidia, the government informed the firm that even the H20 chip’s export would be limited. The decision halted sales at once, leaving no time for the company to clear back orders. U.S. officials pointed to concerns over national security over highly capable AI chips reaching a major geopolitical rival. Nvidia had created the H20 in response to earlier restrictions imposed in 2022 under President Joe Biden. That initial round barred the export of the company’s fastest AI accelerators to China. The H20 is a scaled-down design meant to stay within the allowed performance ceiling. Huang is not worried about China’s military using US tech The CEO returned to the theme in a recent CNN interview that aired Sunday, shortly before another planned trip to China. Huang sought to ease fears that Nvidia hardware might boost Chinese military projects. Huang mentioned that the US need not be concerned about the People’s Liberation Army using US tech because “they simply can’t rely on it.” He added that Washington could cut off access whenever it wants and pointed out that China already has enough computing power. Huang added, “They don’t need Nvidia’s chips, certainly, or American tech stacks in order to build their military.” His remarks come after years of measures in the Congress and the White House to curb shipments of advanced AI chips to Chinese customers. Huang again criticized that strategy, calling it counterproductive to America’s goal of maintaining leadership in cutting‑edge tech. “We want the American tech stack to be the global standard,” he told CNN. “In order for us to do that, we have to be in search of all the AI developers in the world.” He noted that about half of those developers are based in China.

A close above the $122,000 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $123,200 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $125,000 level. The main target could be $130,000. Downside Correction In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $120,500 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Immediate support is near the $117,500 level. The first major support is near the $115,800 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $108,636 swing low to the $123,140 high. The next support is now near the $114,000 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $112,500 support in the near term. The main support sits at $110,500, below which BTC might continue to move down. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $117,500, followed by $115,800.

However, exchange data shows a sharp increase in BTC inflows following this milestone, raising concerns of a potential short-term correction. Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Warn Of Pullback According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Tarekonchain, BTC is beginning to show signs of short-term cooling. Notably, exchange inflows recorded a sharp uptick right after Bitcoin hit its fresh ATH. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Ahead? DXY Breakdown Suggests Capital Shift To Risk-On Assets The following chart shared by the analyst highlights exchange netflows to spot platforms, with notable spikes in inflows to centralized exchanges. This typically indicates profit-taking behavior by short-term holders and some whales. Tarekonchain noted that such on-chain activity is usually indicative of a local top that could lead to a healthy price correction or consolidation in the coming days. They added: It’s a classic pattern we’ve seen after previous parabolic rallies – profits are realized, weak hands exit, and price finds a new base. That said, the analyst noted that despite the warning signs of a looming price correction, the overall market structure remains largely bullish. For instance, long-term holders are still holding their BTC, not keen on selling at current price levels. Supporting the bullish thesis, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continue to attract strong capital. For the week ending July 11, they saw $2.72 billion in net inflows – a clear sign of ongoing institutional interest. Whales Preparing To Sell? In a separate post, CryptoQuant contributor Crazzyblockk pointed to an uptick in whale activity on Binance. The Binance Whale Activity Score shows that deposits from large wallets have spiked dramatically. Related Reading: Bitcoin Uptrend Intact, But Binance Activity Warns Of Short-Term Pullback Whales reportedly deposited as much as 1,800 BTC to Binance in a single day, with more than 35% of transactions valued at over $1 million, hinting at strategic positioning ahead of expected volatility. Crazzyblockk highlighted two possible scenarios following the surge in deposits from large-scale investors. First, it is likely that these investors are sitting on healthy profits and may be getting ready to secure some gains after a historic run. Alternatively, they might be aiming to leverage Binance’s deep liquidity to hedge or open new positions as the market experiences heightened volatility. Either way, this sell-side pressure on Binance is likely to weigh on BTC’s bullish momentum. Despite rising inflows and increased whale activity, market sentiment remains broadly positive. Retail investor participation is still muted compared to previous bull runs, suggesting the current rally might still have room to grow. At press time, BTC trades at $119,449, up 0.8% in the past 24 hours.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $11.14. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $27.9 and $33.66, with an average value of $28.88. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2025 – 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.6384 Market Cap $1.11B Trading Volume $296.99M Circulating Supply 1.75B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.4005 (Jun 18, 2022) 24-hour High $0.6986 24-hour Low $0.6351 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 7.75% 50-Day SMA $0.6242 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 73 (Greed) Green Days 17/30 (57%) 200-Day SMA $0.9977 Optimism price analysis: TL;DR Breakdown: The daily chart shows a bearish breakdown below $0.640 support with a potential test of $0.560 zone. The critical resistance at $0.670 must be reclaimed to restore bullish momentum toward $0.720. Optimism 1-day price chart: OP faces rejection at $0.7 The OP/USDT daily chart for July 15 reveals a clear rejection from the $0.707 resistance level established a few days back, with subsequent selling pressure creating a lower high pattern that threatens the recent recovery narrative. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD indicator at 0.014 remains marginally positive but shows weakening momentum as the histogram bars compress, suggesting diminishing bullish conviction. The current close below $0.640 opens the door for a test of the $0.580-$0.560 support zone where previous consolidation occurred. Optimism 4-hour price chart: OP remains within a tight range The 4-hour signifies reduced volatility that typically precedes significant price movements. The upper Bollinger Band at $0.687 has been acting as dynamic resistance while the lower band at $0.631 provides immediate support, creating a narrow trading range that’s compressing further. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Volume patterns show the recent selling wave peaked around 180M but has since declined to 149.47M, suggesting exhaustion in the current bearish move. The price structure reveals a series of lower highs from the July 12th peak at $0.700, but the lack of decisive volume on the downside moves indicates this could be consolidation rather than the start of a major correction. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.6543 SELL SMA 5 $0.6870 SELL SMA 10 $0.6317 BUY SMA 21 $0.6029 BUY SMA 50 $0.6242 BUY SMA 100 $0.6868 SELL SMA 200 $0.9977 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.5952 BUY EMA 5 $0.6096 BUY EMA 10 $0.6416 SELL EMA 21 $0.6953 SELL EMA 50 $0.8368 SELL EMA 100 $1.0696 SELL EMA 200 $1.3624 SELL What to expect from Optimism? OP is at a make-or-break moment. If it can’t bounce back above $0.67, we’re likely heading down to $0.56. But if buyers step in and push it back above that level, we could see a solid push towards $0.72-$0.75. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up to $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

Optimism historic price sentiment Optimism price history by Coingecko OP launched with an initial value of $4.57 on May 31 but dropped sharply in June due to the UST stablecoin de-pegging and LUNA collapse, closing June at $0.5434. It further declined to $0.4147 by mid-July. In August, OP briefly surged above $1.90, but by mid-October, it dropped to $0.70 following the FTX collapse. In Q1 2023, OP surged past $3.00 during a crypto bull run but lost 66% shortly after. A recovery saw it close the year at $3.90. OP saw an eventful 2024, reaching an all-time high of $4.85 in March before sliding below $2.30 by mid-April. After a brief recovery to over $2.90 in May, it entered a bearish phase, trading at $1.82–$1.96 by July and $1.54–$1.62 by October. November brought a spark of hope with a peak at $2.60. OP closed December within the range of $1.611–$2.773. In January 2025, OP peaked at $2.18 but lost momentum, dropping to as low as $0.84 in February.

ETH is now consolidating gains and might correct lower toward the $2,900 zone. Ethereum started a fresh increase above the $3,000 level. The price is trading near $2,940 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2,980 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it remains supported above the $2,900 zone in the near term. Ethereum Price Rallies Above $3,000 Ethereum price started a fresh increase above the $2,800 zone, like Bitcoin . ETH price gained pace for a move above the $2,880 resistance zone and entered a positive zone. The bulls even pumped the price above $2,920. Finally, it tested the $3,080 zone. A high was formed at $3,081 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,905 swing low to the $3,081 high. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2,980 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading near $2,940 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $2,980 level. The next key resistance is near the $3,000 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,040 level. A clear move above the $3,040 resistance might send the price toward the $3,080 resistance. An upside break above the $3,080 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,200 resistance zone or even $3,220 in the near term. Are Downsides Supported In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,000 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,940 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,905 swing low to the $3,081 high.

July 10th registered the third-largest single-day inflow ever. This marks the 13th week in a row of inflows, raising the cumulative total to $21.8 billion, with year-to-date inflows hitting $22.7 billion. Assets under management surpassed the $200 billion milestone for the first time, reaching a record $211 billion. ETP trading volumes also surged to $29 billion, doubling the year’s typical weekly average. Investors Pour Billions into Bitcoin and Ethereum In the latest edition of the ‘Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report,’ CoinShares revealed Bitcoin investment products recorded $2.7 billion in inflows last week, which pushed the total assets under management (AuM) to $179.5 billion. Interestingly, this means Bitcoin now represents 54% of the AuM held in gold ETPs for the first time. Short Bitcoin ETPs remained quiet with minor inflows of $0.4 million. Ethereum extended its streak with a 12th consecutive week of inflows as it amassed $990 million, its fourth-largest on record. In relative terms, Ethereum’s inflows over 12 weeks equate to 19.5% of its AuM, thereby outperforming Bitcoin’s 9.8%. Solana followed with a strong $92.6 million in inflows, while Sui attracted $3.5 million. During the same period, multi-asset investment products saw $1.1 million in new capital, and Cardano pulled in $0.5 million. On the other hand, XRP led outflows with $104 million, while Chainlink noted $0.5 million in outflows. Regional flows showed the United States in a clear lead with $3.7 billion in inflows, while Switzerland and Canada posted $65.8 million and $17.1 million, respectively. Australia’s inflows stood at $1 million. Germany recorded the week’s largest outflows with $85.7 million. Sweden and Brazil followed with $15.7 million and $7.5 million in outflows. These strong inflows into digital assets have coincided with Bitcoin’s breakout. No Signs of Fatigue? According to QCP Capital, Bitcoin’s rally above $122,000 shows no signs of slowing. In an update, the firm noted that the market underestimated the strength of this parabolic breakout. A decisive technical move and rising institutional demand are driving the surge. To top that, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index jumped from 40 to 70 in three weeks. This signals a clear transition from fear to greed among investors. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw over $2 billion in net inflows last week, which is indicative of a growing institutional participation in the rally. Perpetual funding rates are also nearing 30% as leveraged long positions build while total open interest has crossed $43 billion, levels last seen in January. Despite the rally, implied volatility has not spiked as it usually does. Front-end implied vols rose but remain below last year’s average levels. One-month risk reversals are also flat, which points to little demand for immediate upside. However, September and December risk reversals show strong bids for calls, meaning investors are hedging long-term upside while managing near-term caution. Elevated funding rates also call for careful positioning amid market euphoria. QCP said that it remains structurally bullish on Bitcoin with macro and institutional support. However, it prefers positioning on a pullback rather than chasing the current rally.

According to him, cryptocurrencies like XRP and Ethereum could soon hold a bigger share of the market, especially in terms of assets managed through ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds). Currently, Bitcoin leads with around 5.6% of market share in ETFs, while Ethereum sits at about 3%. McClurg said it’s possible for XRP and ETH to reach around 6% in the future as more people start understanding how these assets work as financial tools. While Ripple, the company behind XRP, faced legal challenges over the years, it built strong partnerships worldwide. He said that Ripple is now well-positioned to compete with traditional financial systems like Fedwire, something that didn’t seem possible a few years ago. On the topic of investments, McClurg said that some investors will prefer ETFs for their simplicity and transparency, while others might go for companies holding cryptocurrencies like XRP as part of their treasury. He expects a mix of both, with some people choosing to invest directly in crypto-backed ETFs, while others might opt for companies managing digital assets. Overall, McClurg believes Ripple is one of the strongest contenders in the race to modernize financial transactions, and XRP could play a big role in this growing market. When asked about altcoin season, he added that while Bitcoin is expected to climb towards $140,000, some altcoins will follow, though not all will reach new highs. “I don’t see Solana or Ethereum breaking new all-time highs this year,” McClurg said. Instead, he said that newer tokens like SUI, Injective, and Axelar have a better chance of hitting fresh records. As for XRP, McClurg said its price movement will likely depend on ongoing legal and regulatory developments, but he does expect it to hit a new high for this year, even if not an all-time record.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,MARKET|XRP|ETH|REGULATION|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-15 04:20:01

Recently, DWF Labs , a major Web3 venture capital firm and market maker, received an astonishing 2.5 billion PUMP tokens. This colossal transfer, valued at approximately $17.4 million, originated from Pump.fun, the platform behind the token itself. This development has ignited widespread speculation, particularly regarding DWF Labs’ potential role as an early investor in the project. DWF Labs’ Strategic Move: What Does This PUMP Token Acquisition Mean? When a firm like DWF Labs makes such a substantial move, the crypto community takes notice. Known for its aggressive and strategic investments across various blockchain projects, DWF Labs often plays a pivotal role in the liquidity and market dynamics of the assets they touch. The receipt of 2.5 billion PUMP tokens from Pump.fun is not just a mere transaction; it’s a potential signal of deeper involvement and confidence in the project’s future. Here’s why this acquisition is particularly noteworthy: Scale of Acquisition: 2.5 billion tokens represent a significant portion, indicating a major stake. Direct Transfer from Source: The tokens came directly from Pump.fun, not through an open market purchase, which lends credence to the early investor theory. Market Impact: DWF Labs’ involvement can often bring increased visibility and liquidity to a token, potentially influencing its price trajectory. This event underscores DWF Labs’ continued influence in shaping the landscape of new and emerging crypto assets. Understanding the PUMP Token: A Closer Look at Its Market Debut The PUMP token is intrinsically linked to Pump.fun, a platform that has gained attention for its unique approach to token creation and distribution. Unlike traditional launches, Pump.fun allows users to create and launch their own tokens with minimal effort, often fostering a highly speculative and community-driven environment. The PUMP token itself serves as the native asset within this ecosystem, likely playing a role in governance, fees, or staking on the platform. The token recently made its debut on major exchanges, including Gate.io, where it is currently trading at approximately $0.005517. This listing provides broader accessibility for investors and marks a crucial step in the token’s journey towards wider adoption. The market’s reaction to the PUMP token’s listing and its subsequent price movements will be closely watched, especially now with DWF Labs’ visible involvement. Pump.fun’s Early Investors: Is DWF Labs Among Them? The speculation that DWF Labs might be one of Pump.fun ’s early investors stems from the nature and timing of the token transfer. Blockchain analytics platform LookOnChain, renowned for its on-chain sleuthing, first reported this transaction via X, highlighting the direct nature of the transfer from Pump.fun to DWF Labs. This type of direct allocation often signifies a pre-listing agreement or an early investment round. Being an early investor carries several implications: Favorable Terms: Early investors typically receive tokens at a much lower price, offering substantial upside potential. Strategic Partnership: It suggests a deeper strategic relationship between DWF Labs and Pump.fun, beyond just market making. Long-Term Commitment: A large early stake indicates a belief in the long-term viability and growth of the Pump.fun ecosystem. While official confirmation is awaited, the on-chain data strongly supports this hypothesis, painting a picture of a well-orchestrated strategic alliance. Navigating Crypto Investment: Insights from This Significant Token Transfer This event offers valuable lessons for anyone involved in crypto investment . The actions of major players like DWF Labs often provide insights into market trends, potential growth areas, and the dynamics of token distribution. For retail investors, understanding these large-scale movements can be crucial for informed decision-making. Key takeaways for investors: Follow On-Chain Data: Platforms like LookOnChain offer transparency into large transactions, revealing potential insider moves or strategic partnerships. Research Investor Profiles: Knowing which major firms are backing a project can be a strong indicator of its perceived value and potential. Understand Tokenomics: Grasping how a token is distributed, its utility, and its market cap helps in assessing its true value. While the allure of quick gains is strong, strategic crypto investment requires diligent research and an understanding of the underlying market mechanics. The Power of Blockchain Analytics: Uncovering Market Signals The very fact that this significant transfer came to light is a testament to the power of blockchain analytics . Platforms like LookOnChain tirelessly monitor public blockchain ledgers, identifying and reporting on large or unusual transactions. This transparency is a cornerstone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) world, allowing anyone with the right tools to trace the flow of assets. How blockchain analytics helps: Transparency: All transactions are recorded and immutable, allowing for public scrutiny. Early Warning System: Unusual transfers or wallet movements can signal upcoming events, such as listings, liquidations, or major investments. Market Intelligence: Analysts can derive valuable insights into whale behavior, institutional activity, and overall market sentiment. For both seasoned traders and curious enthusiasts, blockchain analytics serves as an indispensable tool for understanding the true pulse of the crypto market. Conclusion: A New Chapter for PUMP Token? The acquisition of 2.5 billion PUMP tokens by DWF Labs marks a significant milestone for both the token and the Pump.fun platform. Whether as an early investor or a strategic partner, DWF Labs’ involvement is likely to bring increased attention, potential liquidity, and perhaps even further development opportunities to the PUMP token ecosystem. This event highlights the intricate dance between emerging platforms and established crypto heavyweights, continually shaping the volatile yet exciting world of digital assets. As the PUMP token continues its journey on exchanges like Gate.io, the crypto community will be keenly watching how this massive acquisition influences its trajectory and the broader market.

CoinDCX CEO Says User Crypto Funds Have Never Been Moved According to Crypto India co-founder Aditya Singh , Wazirx claimed in an affidavit filed as part of the Singapore High Court proceedings that CoinDCX was holding its users’ crypto funds with a Lithuanian entity that wasn’t registered with India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) until February 2025. “If this is true – It contradicts with earlier statement made by Coindcx CEO in April 2024,” noted Singh in the X thread. Sumit Gupta, the CEO in question, has quote-reposted the thread to provide clarity on the matter. “All Indian users’ INR and crypto assets on @CoinDCX have always been, and continue to be held by Neblio Technologies, our FIU-IND registered entity, fully compliant with all Indian laws,” said Gupta. The February 2025 date referenced by WazirX in its affidavit coincides with CoinDCX updating its Terms of Use to name Neblio Technologies as the formal contracting party. WazirX claimed that the exchange moved funds back to the FUI-India registered entity around March 2025. If Gupta’s statement is to go by, however, the funds were always with Neblio Technologies and the Terms of Use update was simply a measure to strengthen transparency. “We did this proactively so that CoinDCX users never face challenges like those seen during the WazirX episode,” explained the CoinDCX CEO. “This approach safeguards users’ interests and we hope other Indian exchanges adopt the same standard.” Almost exactly one year ago from today, WazirX was at the center of an infamous hack that led to a loss of user crypto funds worth $234.9 million, almost half the platform’s entire reserve. The exchange shut down operations as soon as the hack became known and has kept deposits and withdrawals suspended ever since. Zettai PTE LTD, the parent company of WazirX, has been seeking approval for a restructuring plan from the Singapore High Court. However, in a major blow to its recovery efforts, the court declined to sanction the proposal on June 4th. The company subsequently filed a request for further arguments, which the court accepted. The next hearing, expected to include discussion of the CoinDCX allegation, is scheduled to take place on July 15th. “Please don’t fall for misinformation,” said the CoinDCX CEO in his X statement. “We remain committed, as always, to user safety, transparency, and regulatory compliance.” Bitcoin Price Bitcoin set a new all-time high (ATH) around the $123,000 level during the past day, but the digital asset has since seen a minor pullback that has sent its price back to $121,900.

The move has added more than 10% to its value over the past week, pushing the global cryptocurrency market valuation above $3.87 trillion, inching toward the $4 trillion mark. The current rally has reignited discussions around volume dynamics and accumulation patterns, as analysts monitor potential early signals that may influence near-term market behavior. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Reach $135,000 By September’s Close, Standard Chartered Forecasts Two contributors to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, BorisVest and Darkfost, have highlighted technical patterns that emerged before and during Bitcoin’s latest breakout. Their analyses suggest a combination of shrinking spot volume and surging accumulation activity may have played a role in driving prices higher. These insights provide a more nuanced view of the forces behind Bitcoin’s recent surge, particularly at a time when market participants weigh upside potential against the possibility of volatility in uncharted price zones. Volume Drop on Binance Preceded Breakout, Analyst Says According to BorisVest, a notable collapse in spot trading volume on Binance preceded Bitcoin’s move out of the $100,000 to $110,000 consolidation range. In his post titled “Binance Spot Volume Collapsed Before Bitcoin’s Breakout: Was It a Hidden Squeeze Signal?”, he explained that declining spot volumes often represent quiet periods of either accumulation or distribution. Binance, due to its liquidity depth and user base, is seen as a reliable proxy for broader crypto market behavior. BorisVest noted that once the breakout began, trading volume spiked sharply. While such spikes can indicate local tops or bottoms, in this case, the surge in volume did not trigger a reversal but instead accelerated the rally. “That’s a strong signal. If the move had no real backing, we would have seen a fast pullback. Instead, Bitcoin kept pushing higher,” he wrote. He emphasized that volume acts as a roadmap for identifying zones of trade concentration and potential shifts in sentiment, cautioning that while Bitcoin’s recent move appears structurally strong, market participants should be aware of the risks tied to high volatility zones. Accumulator Addresses Hit 2025 High Amid Price Surge In a separate update, CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost observed that Bitcoin “accumulator addresses,” wallets with a history of only buying and not selling BTC, have collectively acquired roughly 248,000 BTC in 2025 so far. This is well above the monthly average of 164,000 BTC, pointing to intensified buying activity in recent weeks. “These addresses have no history of distribution and their continued activity at current price levels indicates long-term positioning,” he said. Darkfost also cautioned that if Bitcoin enters a correction or consolidation phase, some of these wallets could begin selling, which would disqualify them as accumulators and potentially introduce significant selling pressure.

A recent announcement that has sent ripples through the digital asset world is the strategic move by global crypto exchange OKX to join Paxos’ Global Dollar Network . This collaboration marks a pivotal moment for the adoption and utility of the USDG stablecoin , promising enhanced liquidity and broader access for users worldwide. It underscores a growing trend of established financial players and innovative crypto platforms coming together to build a more robust and interconnected digital economy. Understanding Paxos’ Global Dollar Network: A Foundation for Digital Trust At its core, Paxos’ Global Dollar Network is an ambitious initiative designed to facilitate the instant, frictionless movement of digital assets, primarily stablecoins, across a global ecosystem. Think of it as a superhighway for digital dollars, enabling seamless transactions between financial institutions, businesses, and individuals. Paxos, a regulated blockchain infrastructure platform, has meticulously built this network with a focus on compliance, security, and efficiency. Regulated Framework: Paxos operates under stringent regulatory oversight, which provides a crucial layer of trust and stability, distinguishing its offerings from many other crypto projects. This regulatory clarity is vital for attracting institutional participants. Interoperability: The network aims to connect various financial systems, exchanges, and payment providers, fostering greater interoperability within the digital asset space. This means easier transfers and settlements across different platforms. Efficiency in Settlement: By leveraging blockchain technology, the Global Dollar Network can significantly reduce settlement times from days to mere seconds, leading to substantial cost savings and operational efficiencies for participants. Scalability: Designed to handle high volumes of transactions, the network is built to scale with the increasing demand for digital dollar settlements, ensuring its long-term viability and utility. The vision behind the Global Dollar Network is to create a truly global, real-time settlement system for digital currencies, fundamentally reshaping how value is transferred and managed in the digital age. This infrastructure is not just about moving stablecoins; it’s about building the rails for a future financial system where digital assets are integrated seamlessly into everyday commerce and finance. The Rise of USDG Stablecoin: A Pillar of Stability in a Volatile Market The USDG stablecoin is a central component of Paxos’ ecosystem and the Global Dollar Network. Unlike many other stablecoins, USDG is designed with a strong emphasis on regulatory compliance and transparency, aiming to be a truly reliable digital representation of the US dollar. Cointelegraph reported that since its launch in November 2024, the stablecoin has achieved a circulating supply in the region of $356 million. This rapid growth, even with a relatively recent launch, highlights the market’s demand for regulated and trustworthy stablecoin options. What makes USDG stablecoin particularly compelling? Full Backing: Every USDG token is 1:1 backed by US dollar deposits and US Treasury bills, held in segregated accounts with FDIC-insured US banks. This ensures that the value of USDG remains consistently pegged to the dollar, offering stability in the often-volatile crypto markets. Audited Transparency: Paxos regularly publishes attestations by a top accounting firm, verifying the full backing of USDG. This commitment to transparency builds confidence among users and institutions. Regulatory Compliance: As a regulated entity, Paxos ensures that USDG adheres to strict anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) standards, making it a preferred choice for institutional players and businesses seeking compliant digital asset solutions. Programmability: Like other digital assets, USDG can be integrated into smart contracts and decentralized applications, unlocking new possibilities for financial innovation, automated payments, and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The substantial circulating supply achieved by USDG stablecoin in such a short period is a testament to its robust design and the market’s increasing preference for regulated, transparent stablecoins. This growth trajectory positions USDG as a significant player in the competitive stablecoin landscape, offering a reliable alternative for users seeking a digital dollar they can trust. Why is OKX Joining Paxos’ Global Dollar Network a Game Changer for Crypto Exchange Users? The decision by OKX , one of the world’s leading crypto exchange platforms, to integrate with Paxos’ Global Dollar Network is a significant development with far-reaching implications for its vast user base. This partnership is not merely a technical integration; it represents a strategic alignment that promises enhanced liquidity, efficiency, and new opportunities for millions of users. Here’s how this collaboration benefits OKX users and the broader crypto ecosystem: Enhanced Liquidity for USDG: By integrating USDG into its platform, OKX immediately boosts the stablecoin’s liquidity, making it easier for users to buy, sell, and trade USDG. Increased liquidity leads to tighter spreads and better execution prices for traders. New Trading Pairs and Opportunities: The availability of USDG on OKX could lead to the introduction of new trading pairs, offering users more diverse trading strategies and access to different markets. This expands the utility of USDG beyond simple transfers. Faster and Cheaper Settlements: Leveraging the Global Dollar Network, OKX users can experience faster and potentially cheaper settlements for transactions involving USDG, especially for cross-border payments or large-volume trades. This efficiency is crucial for both retail and institutional traders. Increased Trust and Security: For OKX users, the partnership with a regulated entity like Paxos and the use of a fully backed stablecoin like USDG adds an extra layer of trust and security. This can be particularly appealing to institutional investors and businesses looking for compliant pathways into the crypto market. Seamless Integration: The integration is designed to be seamless for users, allowing them to access USDG and the benefits of the Global Dollar Network directly through their existing OKX accounts, without needing to navigate complex external systems. This move positions OKX at the forefront of adopting regulated digital assets, catering to a growing demand for secure and compliant financial instruments within the decentralized space. It signifies OKX’s commitment to providing its users with the best and most reliable tools for navigating the digital economy. The Broader Impact: Reshaping the Stablecoin and Digital Asset Landscape The collaboration between OKX and Paxos’ Global Dollar Network extends beyond the immediate benefits for their respective users; it has significant implications for the entire stablecoin and digital asset landscape. This partnership serves as a powerful example of how traditional finance principles can converge with blockchain innovation to create a more robust and accessible global financial system. Institutional Adoption: A Bridge to Traditional Finance One of the most profound impacts of this partnership is its potential to accelerate institutional adoption of digital assets. Traditional financial institutions often hesitate to engage with cryptocurrencies due to concerns about regulatory clarity, volatility, and counterparty risk. By offering a regulated stablecoin like USDG through a major crypto exchange like OKX, the partnership provides a more familiar and secure entry point for these entities. Reduced Risk: Regulated stablecoins minimize the risk associated with unbacked or less transparent digital assets, making them more palatable for risk-averse institutions. Compliance Pathways: The adherence to AML/KYC standards by Paxos offers clear compliance pathways, which are essential for banks, asset managers, and corporate treasuries looking to explore digital assets. Operational Efficiency: The Global Dollar Network’s ability to facilitate instant settlements can significantly improve the operational efficiency of institutional trading and treasury management, attracting more capital into the digital asset space. Competitive Dynamics in the Stablecoin Market The stablecoin market is highly competitive, dominated by giants like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). The entry of USDG stablecoin into the mainstream via OKX introduces a strong contender, emphasizing regulatory compliance and transparency as key differentiators. This could lead to a healthy competition that benefits users through improved services, lower fees, and greater trust.

Future of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Centralized Exchanges (CEX) The partnership highlights a growing trend of synergy between CEXs and the broader DeFi ecosystem. While OKX is a centralized exchange, its integration with a regulated stablecoin and network like Paxos’ can bring the benefits of institutional-grade assets to DeFi applications. This could lead to more robust and reliable DeFi protocols that leverage the stability and compliance of assets like USDG. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities for USDG and Crypto Exchanges While the partnership between OKX and Paxos’ Global Dollar Network presents immense opportunities, the path forward is not without its challenges. The rapidly evolving regulatory landscape and intense competition in the stablecoin market require continuous adaptation and innovation. Regulatory Headwinds and Clarity Stablecoins are increasingly under the scrutiny of regulators worldwide. While Paxos prides itself on its regulatory compliance, future regulations could impact the operational frameworks of both the Global Dollar Network and the USDG stablecoin . Navigating these evolving rules will be crucial for sustained growth and broader adoption. Clear and consistent regulatory frameworks are essential for stablecoins to reach their full potential as a bridge between traditional and digital finance. Competition and Market Dominance Despite its unique selling points, USDG faces stiff competition from established stablecoins with deep liquidity and widespread adoption. Gaining significant market share will require sustained efforts in marketing, user education, and strategic partnerships. The ability to differentiate USDG through superior features, lower transaction costs, or unique ecosystem benefits will be key. Scalability and Interoperability Beyond the Network While the Global Dollar Network is designed for scalability, the broader interoperability with diverse blockchain networks and traditional payment systems will be an ongoing challenge. Ensuring seamless transitions between different digital asset ecosystems and fiat on/off-ramps is vital for mass adoption. Opportunities for Innovation and Growth Despite the challenges, the opportunities are vast. The partnership opens doors for: New Financial Products: The stable and regulated nature of USDG can enable the creation of innovative financial products on OKX and other platforms, such as lending protocols, derivatives, and structured products. Cross-Border Payments: The efficiency of the Global Dollar Network, combined with OKX’s global reach, can revolutionize cross-border payments, making them faster, cheaper, and more transparent for businesses and individuals. Broader Digital Asset Integration: As more institutions and businesses adopt USDG, it could pave the way for wider acceptance of other digital assets in mainstream commerce and finance. For investors and businesses, the actionable insight is clear: closely monitor the development of regulated stablecoins like USDG. Their integration into major exchanges like OKX signals a maturing market where stability, compliance, and efficiency are becoming paramount. Diversifying stablecoin holdings to include regulated options can mitigate risks and open new avenues for investment and treasury management. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a More Integrated Crypto Future The strategic alliance between OKX and Paxos’ Global Dollar Network represents a transformative moment for the digital asset industry. By integrating the regulated USDG stablecoin , OKX is not just enhancing its own offerings but also contributing to the maturation of the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. This partnership exemplifies the growing convergence of traditional financial rigor and blockchain innovation, laying down a robust foundation for a future where digital assets are seamlessly integrated into global commerce and finance. The benefits are clear: enhanced liquidity, increased trust, greater efficiency, and new opportunities for both retail and institutional participants. While challenges remain, the commitment of major players like OKX and Paxos to build compliant and reliable infrastructure signals a powerful shift towards a more secure, accessible, and integrated digital economy. This collaboration is a testament to the industry’s relentless pursuit of innovation, promising a more stable and efficient financial future for all.

The Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) discussed how existing laws, regulations and risk-management protocols apply to crypto ‘safekeeping.’ The agencies clarified that the statement does not create any new supervisory expectations, emphasizing the need for stronger risk-management practices. “[The statement] reminds banks that provide or are considering providing safekeeping of such assets that they must do so in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.” @federalreserve @FDICgov @USOCC issue joint statement on risk-management considerations for crypto-asset safekeeping: https://t.co/1VFNYCx75T — Federal Reserve (@federalreserve) July 14, 2025 Banks Can Provide Crypto Custody in Two Forms: Fed Agencies The trio of agencies stressed that the proper way to custody such assets involves “controlling the cryptographic keys associated with the crypto-asset in a manner that complies with applicable laws and regulations,” a detailed 7-page memo read. Further, banks can offer crypto custody in two forms: fiduciary and non-fiduciary, they added. In a fiduciary arrangement, where banks are legally authorized to act on behalf of clients like a trustee, specific federal regulations (12 CFR 9 or 150) must be followed. Additionally, state laws and regulations, and any other applicable legal provisions, are also in place, the statement noted. For non-fiduciary services, banks are mandated to implement robust protections to safeguard customers’ digital assets. This includes protection against cyber threats, data loss and mismanagement of private keys. Fed Agencies’ Pivot From Previous Crypto Guidances US Fed agencies have previously restricted banks from easily engaging with crypto businesses under the Biden administration. In March, the current crypto-friendly President Donald Trump signed a long-awaited crypto order that sets a federal agenda meant to move U.S. digital assets businesses into friendly oversight. As a result, the FDIC officially removed “reputational risk” as a factor in bank supervision, creating a significant victory for the crypto space. The agency also issued new guidance that cleared the way for supervised banks in the US to engage in crypto-related activities without seeking prior approval. The @FDICgov revised its crypto policy, letting banks engage in digital asset services without prior approval. Oversight continues through post-notification reviews. #CryptoRegulation #FDIC https://t.co/lOsoTfKKtN — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 29, 2025 The latest statement from the agencies arrives on the first day of the U.S. House of Representatives’ self-described Crypto Week .

Recently, Binance made a pivotal move, announcing the Binance PUMP conversion of its PUMP pre-market perpetual contracts into standard perpetual contracts. This isn’t just a technical tweak; it’s a strategic enhancement designed to streamline trading and potentially unlock new opportunities for traders. What’s the Big Deal? Understanding the Binance PUMP Conversion The core of this announcement revolves around the shift of PUMP’s trading status on Binance. Previously, PUMP was available via pre-market perpetual contracts, a specific type of derivative designed for assets not yet fully launched or widely available for spot trading. These contracts often come with unique characteristics, including specific settlement mechanisms and potentially higher volatility due to limited liquidity and price discovery. The Binance PUMP conversion to standard perpetual contracts signifies a move towards greater market maturity and accessibility for the PUMP asset. This conversion means that PUMP perpetual contracts will now operate under the same rules and conditions as other established perpetual contracts on Binance, offering a more familiar and predictable trading environment. For traders, this translates into several key changes: Enhanced Liquidity: Standard perpetual markets typically attract a wider range of participants, leading to deeper order books and potentially tighter spreads. Simplified Trading: The complexities often associated with pre-market contracts, such as specific settlement periods or unique margin requirements, are typically removed. Broader Accessibility: More traders might feel comfortable engaging with PUMP now that it operates within a standard framework. Demystifying PUMP Perpetual Contracts: What Changes? To fully grasp the implications of this change, it’s essential to understand the difference between pre-market and standard PUMP perpetual contracts . Pre-market contracts are essentially bets on the future price of an asset before its official launch or widespread trading. They serve as a mechanism for early price discovery and speculative trading, but often come with caveats like: Limited Trading Windows: Often restricted to specific times. Unique Margin Requirements: Potentially higher initial margins or specific collateral. Settlement Procedures: Different rules for how contracts are settled upon the asset’s official listing. In contrast, standard perpetual contracts are derivative instruments that allow traders to speculate on the price of an underlying asset without owning the asset itself, and without an expiry date. They are characterized by: 24/7 Trading: Continuous trading availability. Funding Rates: A mechanism to keep the perpetual contract price close to the underlying spot price. Standardized Margin: Consistent margin requirements across various assets. The conversion ensures that PUMP perpetual contracts now align with these standard features, offering a more robust and liquid trading experience. This standardization is a crucial part of the broader Binance trading update , reflecting the exchange’s commitment to providing diverse yet user-friendly trading options. How This Binance Trading Update Benefits You The recent Binance trading update for PUMP is more than just a procedural change; it’s a move designed to enhance the overall trading experience and market efficiency. For active traders and long-term investors alike, the benefits are clear: Increased Liquidity and Price Stability: With PUMP now on standard perpetuals, we can expect a significant influx of liquidity. This means it will be easier to enter and exit positions without causing significant price slippage. Greater liquidity also often leads to more stable and predictable price movements, reducing the impact of large individual orders. Enhanced Accessibility and Familiarity: Traders accustomed to standard perpetuals on Binance will find the PUMP market much more intuitive. This ease of access can attract more participants, further deepening the market. It removes the learning curve associated with specialized pre-market contracts, making PUMP more approachable. Improved Arbitrage Opportunities: As liquidity grows and the contract behaves more like a standard perpetual, arbitrage opportunities between PUMP’s perpetual contract and any potential future spot market or other derivative markets may become more consistent and viable for sophisticated traders. This strategic decision by Binance underscores its commitment to fostering a dynamic and accessible trading environment for its users, ensuring that even newer assets like PUMP can quickly integrate into the mainstream of crypto perpetuals trading. Navigating Crypto Perpetuals: A Strategic Move for Traders For anyone engaged in the world of crypto perpetuals , this conversion represents a key development that demands attention. The transition of PUMP from a niche pre-market offering to a standard perpetual contract integrates it more fully into the broader ecosystem of derivatives trading. Traders now have a more direct and standardized way to gain exposure to PUMP’s price movements, utilizing familiar tools and strategies. Actionable Insights for Traders: Re-evaluate Strategies: If you were trading PUMP pre-market, review your strategies. The new liquidity and behavior of standard perpetuals might require adjustments to your entry/exit points, stop-loss orders, and overall risk management. Monitor Funding Rates: Standard perpetual contracts involve funding rates. Understand how these rates work for PUMP, as they can impact the cost of holding positions over time. Leverage with Caution: While increased liquidity can make leverage seem less risky, the inherent volatility of crypto markets remains. Always use leverage responsibly and understand the liquidation risks. Look for Arbitrage: As PUMP becomes more liquid, keep an eye on potential price discrepancies between its perpetual contract and any future spot listings or other platforms, if applicable. This strategic shift provides a robust framework for traders to engage with PUMP, leveraging the familiar mechanics of standard perpetual contracts to potentially maximize their trading outcomes. The Future of Pre-Market Trading and Beyond While the focus here is on PUMP’s transition, this event also prompts a broader discussion about the role of pre-market trading on major exchanges like Binance. Pre-market offerings serve a crucial function in the crypto ecosystem by allowing early price discovery and liquidity for nascent projects. They provide a bridge between an asset’s initial hype and its full market debut. Binance’s decision to convert PUMP indicates a maturation path for assets that successfully navigate their pre-market phase. It suggests that once an asset demonstrates sufficient interest and stability, it can transition to a more conventional, liquid trading environment. This process can be seen as a positive sign for the ecosystem, indicating a structured approach to bringing new assets into mainstream trading. This conversion might set a precedent for how other successful pre-market listings will be handled in the future, fostering a more predictable and streamlined journey for new tokens from their initial offering to becoming fully integrated into the broader crypto derivatives landscape. Conclusion: Seizing the Opportunity in the New PUMP Landscape The Binance PUMP conversion from pre-market to standard perpetual contracts is a significant development for the PUMP token and its trading community. It marks a strategic move by Binance to enhance liquidity, simplify trading, and integrate PUMP more deeply into its extensive derivatives ecosystem. This Binance trading update provides a more robust and familiar environment for traders, aligning PUMP with the widely adopted structure of crypto perpetuals . For traders, this means more predictable trading conditions, potentially tighter spreads, and greater accessibility. It’s an opportune moment to reassess your trading strategies for PUMP, taking advantage of the increased liquidity and standardized mechanics. While the benefits are clear, remember to approach trading with caution, understanding the inherent risks of volatile crypto markets. This event underscores Binance’s ongoing efforts to innovate and refine its offerings, ensuring its platform remains at the forefront of the digital asset trading world. The future of PUMP trading, now firmly rooted in the standard perpetuals market, looks set for a more streamlined and liquid journey.

The price of BTC surpassed $120,000 for the first time in its history. According to Binance data, BTC continued to break records during the day yesterday and broke a new record by surpassing $123,000. However, this upward momentum was short-lived. After reaching a record high of $123,000, Bitcoin's price began to decline, falling to $117,000. This decline was also reflected in altcoins. Ethereum (ETH) fell below $3,000 again, dropping to $2,950. XRP fell 2.4% in the last 24 hours, Solana (SOL) fell 4.4%, and Dogecoin (DOGE) fell 6.6%. Analysis firm Alphractal stated that this decline was due to reduced buying pressure and selling pressure from investors seeking to take profits. Stating that this decline is normal, Alphractal stated that the current phase represents a natural correction phase and should be monitored carefully until the market stabilizes. Alphractal CEO Joao Wedson also stated that he expects a short-term correction. He noted that the downward trend could continue for some time, predicting that the BTC price could drop to as low as $108,000 before rising to $143,000-$148,000. “Short-term outlook for BTC: $115,000 seems inevitable, but a drop to $108,000 is still on the table before a potential rally to $143,000-$146,000 if momentum picks up. *This is not investment advice.

On Monday, on its “List-a-Thon” livestream, the platform announced it will be adding stocks of major US companies like Nike (NKE), McDonald’s (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), Coca-Cola (KO), Uber, and Yum! Brands (YUM). The platform now offers 37 equities to EU users following its earlier launches of tokenized stocks in late June and July 3. Gemini boosts EU market access with 21 new tokenized stocks across top sectors Gemini’s official blog highlights the latest stock additions as a major step forward in expanding its offerings for European users. The platform included 21 new equities on July 3, like Apple, Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, and crypto companies such as Coinbase and Marathon Digital (MARA) Holdings. Not too far from its initial launch of Strategy tokenized stocks, on June 27, for EU investors. Gemini’s latest addition includes 14 stocks across diverse industries, strengthening portfolio flexibility for EU investors. It includes popular brands like Nike, known for its athletic wear; McDonald’s, a global fast-food powerhouse; Starbucks, the coffeehouse leader; Coca-Cola, a beverage industry icon; and Yum! Brands, the parent of major chains like KFC, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut. The platform has now grown to encompass some SaaS giants like Cisco (CSCO), Adobe (ADBE), Snowflake (SNOW), and Hut 8 (HUT) as well. On the travel front, it gained significant players with Delta Air Lines (DAL), Booking Holdings (BKNG), Uber (UBER), Carnival Corporation (CCL), and Rocket Lab. Gemini is maintaining its relationship with Dinari, the issuer of dShares™—tokenized financial instruments that track the value of US equities 1:1 and provide the same economic rights, subject to legal limitations. Dinari manages token issuance , with tokens minted on the Arbitrum network for optimized performance. These tokenized stocks are available 24/7 on Gemini, charging a 1.49% trading fee. US-based crypto exchange and custodian service Gemini is bolstering its lineup of tokenized assets with the addition of BlockFi Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) funds. Token issuance is managed by Dinari, where tokens are minted on the Arbitrum chain to be more efficient. Gemini provides 24/7 trading availability for these tokenized stocks while charging a 1.49% fee per transaction. Gemini Intergalactic EU Artemis, Ltd, an entity authorized and regulated by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA), rolled out these stock offerings. Robinhood’s tokenized product is still under regulatory scrutiny Other firms are also moving into tokenized equities following Gemini’s lead. Robinhood, for example, debuted its “Stock Tokens” product to European customers on June 30, with as many as 215 stock tokens being issued on the Arbitrum Layer 2 network. But the launch has been met with setbacks, since the product is still facing regulatory scrutiny. Stock tokens are considered products in the stocks of companies like OpenAI and SpaceX. However, OpenAI has publicly disavowed the service and has raised further concerns. After Robinhood made the announcement, OpenAI warned users that the tokens are not real OpenAI equity, stressed it was not in any way connected with Robinhood, and emphasized that any valid transfer of its equity must receive prior written approval, which it did not. Recently, Lithuania’s central bank even asked Robinhood to clarify its tokenized equities further, following OpenAI’s response. The bank made it clear that only after the platform responds will they be able to evaluate the legality and compliance of the product. Addressing OpenAI’s comments, Vlad Tenev, CEO of Robinhood, only maintained that their tokenized product opens up access for retail investors by offering indirect exposure, a structure enabled by their investment in a special purpose vehicle. Meanwhile, Kraken and Bybit have also launched their tokenized offerings. Kraken now offers stock trading via interfaces modeled after standard crypto pairings, while Bybit offers its xStocks on both its TradFi and decentralized “Byreal” platforms.

While SHIB aims for a realistic price target of $0.00005, Ozak AI, currently priced at just $0.005 in its fourth presale stage, is eyeing the $1 milestone, which would represent an extraordinary 200x surge. The question facing investors is clear: which one holds the stronger upside potential by the end of 2025? Shiba Inu’s Steady Climb Toward $0.00005 Shiba Inu is one of the most recognizable meme coins within the crypto space. Originally launched as a playful opportunity to Dogecoin, SHIB has developed into a full-fledged ecosystem with its very own decentralized exchange (ShibaSwap), and even plans for a Layer-2 network referred to as Shibarium. As of now, SHIB trades at around $0.00001321, displaying resilience in market dips and keeping strong network support. Analysts recommend that SHIB may want to attain $0.00005 in 2025 under favorable conditions. For this goal to materialize, the overall market needs to enter a strong bull cycle, and Shiba Inu needs to deliver on its roadmap guarantees, especially in utility and adoption. If Shibarium achieves scalability and adoption amongst builders or users, it can deliver real use cases that push demand higher. However, SHIB is still heavily reliant on social sentiment and community-pushed hype. Unlike tokens with deeper essential backing, SHIB’s path to major price boom depends largely on viral traits, strategic burns of supply, and consistent interest from influencers. Although hitting $0.01 remains a distant dream, the $0.00005 goal is in the realm of opportunity, in particular if macroeconomic elements align in crypto’s choice. Youtube embed: Next 500X AI Altcoin Ozak AI’s Breakout Potential Toward $1 On the opposite end of the spectrum is Ozak AI —a project deeply rooted in utility, offering a real use case that merges blockchain infrastructure with AI-powered financial insights. Ozak AI’s platform includes components like the Ozak Stream Network (OSN), Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN), customizable AI prediction agents, and data vaults. These tools aim to empower both retail and institutional traders with high-quality predictive analytics derived from real-time data. Ozak AI is currently in its fourth Ozak AI presale stage, priced at just $0.005. With over $1.3 million already raised, the project has attracted early interest and is listed on both CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko . If Ozak AI gains market traction and delivers on its promises, a $1 price target would represent a staggering 200x return for current investors. Unlike SHIB, which relies heavily on meme power and community engagement, Ozak AI offers a more structured, innovation-driven investment case. Its architecture is designed for scalability and real-world integration—making it attractive to traders, analysts, and even institutions that are looking for smarter tools powered by artificial intelligence. If AI adoption continues to grow across industries, Ozak AI could be well-positioned to capitalize on this trend within the crypto space. Who Holds the Upper Hand Going Into 2025? Both SHIB and Ozak AI cater to different investor appetites. SHIB represents the nostalgia and momentum of the meme coin era, still capable of delivering short-term surges and driven by an extremely passionate community. But it also comes with risks tied to volatility and speculation, as it lacks substantial utility that would anchor its long-term value. Ozak AI, on the other hand, brings disruptive potential by offering predictive AI tools within a decentralized framework. As investors increasingly look beyond hype toward real innovation, Ozak AI’s fundamentals may provide a more solid foundation for sustained growth. The project’s ambitious goal of reaching $1 isn’t just based on hope—it’s rooted in an expanding market demand for AI-integrated financial tools. While Shiba Inu may succeed in hitting $0.00005 with continued community support and favorable market conditions, Ozak AI presents a more intriguing value proposition for those seeking exponential returns. The combination of AI utility, a growing presale, and early exposure at $0.005 makes Ozak AI one of the more compelling tokens to watch. Whether investors prefer meme power or machine learning, 2025 is shaping up to be a breakout year for both—but the smarter bet may lie in the AI-driven future that Ozak AI is building. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based crypto task that provides an innovative platform that focuses on predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized community technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to help crypto lovers and corporations make the perfect choices.

For years, traditional financial institutions, particularly banks, have eyed digital assets with a mix of fascination and caution. The primary hurdle? A distinct lack of clear, comprehensive rules. But now, a significant step forward has been taken, promising a new era of US crypto regulation . Imagine the relief for banks looking to dip their toes into the digital asset ocean! The Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) have collectively released a pivotal joint “blue paper.” This document isn’t just another piece of bureaucratic text; it’s a foundational guide, outlining how lending institutions are expected to manage their bank crypto holdings . It aims to demystify the regulatory landscape, providing much-needed expectations for banks engaging with digital assets. This move is a testament to the growing recognition of crypto’s permanence and the urgent need for a structured approach. What Exactly Is This Landmark Digital Asset Guidance? This joint paper, a collaborative effort from three of the most influential financial regulators in the United States, serves as a crucial framework for financial institutions. It’s designed to ensure that banks, as they explore or expand their involvement with cryptocurrencies, do so in a safe and sound manner. Think of it as a comprehensive playbook for navigating the complexities of digital assets, covering everything from custody to risk management. A Unified Stance: For the first time, these three key agencies have presented a united front, signaling a harmonized approach to crypto oversight. This eliminates much of the guesswork banks previously faced when dealing with disparate or ambiguous directives. Focus on Risk Management: The core of the guidance revolves around identifying and mitigating risks associated with crypto activities. This includes operational risks, liquidity risks, cyber risks, and compliance risks, ensuring banks maintain robust frameworks. Clarity for Diverse Activities: Whether a bank is considering holding crypto on its balance sheet, offering crypto custody services, or facilitating client crypto transactions, the paper provides clarity on the supervisory expectations for each activity. This isn’t just about setting rules; it’s about fostering responsible innovation within a secure financial system. The paper emphasizes that banks must possess the necessary expertise, infrastructure, and risk management systems before engaging in crypto-related activities. Why Was Regulatory Clarity So Urgently Needed for Bank Crypto Holdings? For years, the absence of clear directives left many banks in a state of paralysis. The potential for innovation and new revenue streams was evident, but the fear of regulatory backlash or unforeseen risks loomed large. This created a significant barrier to entry for mainstream financial institutions into the crypto space. Consider the landscape prior to this release: Aspect Before Joint Paper After Joint Paper (Expected) Regulatory Certainty Fragmented, ambiguous, or non-existent guidance. High legal and compliance risk. Unified, explicit guidelines from top regulators. Reduced uncertainty. Bank Engagement Hesitation, limited pilot programs, “wait-and-see” approach due to fear of regulatory penalties. Clearer path for strategic engagement, potential for broader adoption of crypto services. Risk Management Banks developing internal, often inconsistent, risk frameworks for crypto. Standardized expectations for robust risk management, aligning with traditional banking principles. Market Perception Crypto often viewed as a risky, speculative asset class, separate from mainstream finance. Increased legitimization of digital assets, paving the way for broader institutional acceptance. This regulatory clarity is not just beneficial for banks; it’s a crucial step for the entire digital asset ecosystem. It signals a maturation of the market and a recognition by traditional financial gatekeepers that crypto is here to stay and needs to be integrated responsibly. What Role Does the Federal Reserve Crypto Stance Play in This? The involvement of the Federal Reserve is particularly significant. As the central bank of the United States, the Fed’s stance carries immense weight, influencing monetary policy, financial stability, and the overall banking system. Their participation in this joint paper underscores the seriousness with which digital assets are now being viewed at the highest levels of financial governance. The Federal Reserve has previously expressed a cautious but open approach to digital currencies, exploring concepts like a central bank digital currency (CBDC) while also highlighting the risks associated with private stablecoins and other crypto assets. Their presence in this joint guidance suggests a concerted effort to: Maintain Financial Stability: Ensuring that the integration of crypto into the banking system does not introduce systemic risks that could jeopardize the broader financial system. Promote Sound Practices: Guiding banks to adopt best practices for managing digital assets, similar to how they manage traditional assets, but with an understanding of crypto’s unique characteristics. Foster Responsible Innovation: Creating an environment where banks can innovate with digital assets while adhering to robust regulatory standards. The Fed’s involvement essentially gives this guidance a powerful seal of approval, signaling to the banking sector that engaging with crypto is no longer a wild west endeavor but a regulated frontier. How Does This Digital Asset Guidance Empower Banks? This guidance offers more than just rules; it offers a roadmap for banks to confidently navigate the digital asset space. For financial institutions that have been on the sidelines, waiting for clearer signals, this paper is a green light to explore and potentially offer crypto-related services. It transforms uncertainty into opportunity. Key Empowerment Aspects: Reduced Compliance Risk: With explicit guidelines, banks can develop compliance frameworks that align directly with regulatory expectations, minimizing the risk of penalties or enforcement actions. Strategic Planning: Banks can now integrate crypto strategies into their long-term business plans, allocating resources, and building infrastructure with a clearer understanding of the regulatory boundaries. Enhanced Client Services: The ability to offer regulated crypto services, such as custody or trading, can attract new clients and retain existing ones who are increasingly interested in digital assets. Competitive Edge: Early movers who adapt quickly to these guidelines and build robust crypto offerings may gain a significant competitive advantage in the evolving financial landscape. This is not to say that the path will be entirely smooth. Banks will still face challenges, including the need for specialized talent, significant technology investments, and continuous adaptation to a rapidly evolving market. However, the foundational digital asset guidance provides a strong starting point. What’s Next for US Crypto Regulation and Banking? This joint paper is undoubtedly a significant milestone, but it’s important to view it as a beginning, not an end. The regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving, and this guidance lays the groundwork for future, more detailed rules and policies. Looking Ahead: Further Rulemaking: Expect more specific rules and regulations to emerge from these agencies, building upon the principles outlined in this initial guidance. This could include capital requirements for crypto exposures, specific consumer protection rules, and detailed operational standards. Industry Adaptation: Banks will need to invest heavily in understanding and implementing these guidelines. This includes training staff, upgrading systems, and potentially forming partnerships with crypto-native firms. Global Harmonization: As the US moves towards clearer regulation, it could influence other jurisdictions to follow suit, potentially leading to more harmonized global standards for crypto. Continued Dialogue: The regulators have emphasized that they will continue to monitor the market and engage with stakeholders, suggesting an iterative approach to regulation. For financial institutions, the actionable insight is clear: don’t wait. Begin assessing your current capabilities, identify potential gaps in your risk management and compliance frameworks, and prepare to integrate these new expectations into your operations. This proactive approach will be key to thriving in the new era of regulated bank crypto holdings . A New Era of Regulatory Clarity Dawns The release of this joint paper by the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC marks a monumental moment for both traditional finance and the cryptocurrency industry. It signifies a decisive shift from ambiguity to a structured framework for managing digital assets within the banking sector. This landmark US crypto regulation provides the much-needed regulatory clarity that banks have been craving, enabling them to confidently explore and engage with the burgeoning digital asset space. While challenges remain, the foundation has been laid for a more secure, stable, and integrated financial future where digital assets play a recognized role. This move not only legitimizes crypto further but also promises to unlock new avenues for innovation and growth within the regulated financial system. It’s an exciting time to watch how this guidance shapes the next chapter of finance.

The drop is largely due to a rapid increase in Pi’s circulating supply, weak demand, and low market liquidity. While Bitcoin enjoys the spotlight in this bull run, Pi Coin is struggling to keep up, and some in the community now fear the worst. Why Pi Network Price Today Remains Low Despite Mainnet Growth? Many Pi supporters admit they would love to see Pi hit $10 someday. But for this bull market, that dream is slipping further away. One of the biggest challenges facing Pi right now is the rapid increase in its circulating supply. With mobile mining rewards continuously being unlocked and more tokens migrating from testnet to mainnet, supply is growing faster than demand. This has led to over $37 million worth of Pi tokens getting migrated to the mainnet. But despite this growth, the price of Pi Coin is stuck near its lowest levels, trading around $0.45. Low Liquidity and Developer Inaction Weigh Heavily on Pi Coin Value The Pi community believes that rising supply , along with low market liquidity, is the main reason Pi is struggling to grow. There’s very little buying interest, and not enough liquidity to support price gains. On top of that, the project is facing criticism for limited support from the developer team. Many feel the Core Team is not giving enough space for community developers to contribute, which could be slowing innovation and shaking investor confidence. Pi Coin Technical Analysis Signals More Downside Ahead On higher time frames, the Pi price chart is showing lower lows, often a warning sign of further downside. When Bitcoin surged past $122,000 recently, Pi only touched $0.53 before crashing back down to $0.45 . However, Pi is currently trapped under the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement zone, suggesting it may continue to slide unless demand picks up. The next support lies around $0.40, a level which hasn’t been touched since the beginning of June. Pi Coin Forecast: Recovery Ahead or a Prolonged Crypto Winter? Despite the gloomy outlook, some see this dip as a rare opportunity. While others fear the end, a few view it as a time to accumulate. But with scammers outpacing community trust, engagement dropping, and more unlocks on the way, Pi’s short-term future looks shaky. The question now is: can Pi recover from this deep correction, or is this the beginning of a longer winter?",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|MINING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-15 05:26:20

SOL price is now correcting gains and might find bids near the $155 support zone SOL price started a fresh upward move above the $155 and $160 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $162 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $162 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $162 resistance zone. Solana Price Corrects Gains Solana price started a decent increase after it cleared the $160 resistance, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL climbed above the $162 level to enter a short-term positive zone. However, the price is facing a major hurdle at $168 and $169. A high is formed at $168.60 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $158 swing low to the $168 high. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $162 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading below $162 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. It is also trading below the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $158 swing low to the $168 high. The price is now approaching the $158 support. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $160 level. The next major resistance is near the $162 level. The main resistance could be $1685. A successful close above the $168 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $178. Any more gains might send the price toward the $185 level. More Losses in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $162 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $158 zone. The first major support is near the $155 level. A break below the $155 level might send the price toward the $150 zone. If there is a close below the $150 support, the price could decline toward the $145 support in the near term.

The legislation addresses central bank digital currencies, regulatory clarity for digital assets, and stablecoin frameworks. The proceedings already caused heated debates. Democrats like Rep. Maxine Waters and Rep. Jim McGovern criticised the bills for favoring Trump-linked crypto ventures and wealthy investors over consumer protections. Meanwhile, US regulators also issued joint guidance warning banks about the legal and operational risks of crypto custody services. Crypto Week Begins The US House of Representatives is set to deliberate on a series of key cryptocurrency bills this week as part of what Republican lawmakers call ”crypto week.” The legislative focus will be on three major proposals: the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act, and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act. These bills target issues related to central bank digital currencies, digital asset regulatory frameworks, and payment stablecoins. The House Committee on Rules, led by Republicans, first met on Monday to review the proposed amendments. (Source: Committee on Rules ) Among the most contentious developments are the series of amendments that were introduced by Democratic lawmakers. Representative Maxine Waters, a leading Democratic voice on financial regulation, submitted four alternative versions of the GENIUS Act. In her op-ed on MSNBC, she criticized the current bills as being crafted by and for the crypto industry rather than for consumer protection. Waters specifically raised concerns about President Donald Trump’s alleged conflicts of interest through his family-linked crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, which includes the USD1 stablecoin and the TRUMP meme coin. One of her proposed amendments is to ban US presidents, vice presidents, members of Congress, and their immediate families from holding or promoting cryptocurrencies. She also suggested the Treasury Secretary should be restricted from recognizing any foreign nation as having a comparable stablecoin regime if its leader referred to themselves as a dictator. This is likely a reference to El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele. On the Republican side, Representative Warren Davidson proposed an amendment to reinforce the right of individuals to self-custody digital assets through hardware or software wallets. Representative French Hill of Arkansas, chair of the House Financial Services Committee, fully supports the upcoming legislation, and stated that it will enhance investor protections while also cementing the US as a global leader in crypto innovation. With only eight legislative days remaining before the August recess, the timeline for final votes is tight. If the House moves quickly, floor votes on the bills could take place before lawmakers depart for the summer break. Democrats Slam Crypto Bills When crypto week’s first session began, it very quickly veered away from digital assets and into broader disputes over defense spending. Massachusetts Representative Jim McGovern opened with a scathing critique of the GOP’s legislative push, referring to the GENIUS, the CLARITY Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act as a “crypto giveaway.” He warned that the bills offer ineffective regulations because they benefit wealthy individuals and Trump-affiliated ventures at the expense of retail investors. McGovern mocked the notion of public demand for these bills by stating that no one in his district had asked him to make it easier for “crypto millionaires to get richer.” On the other side, Republican Representative Virginia Foxx defended the initiatives, especially the GENIUS Act, by calling it historic legislation that would position the US as a global leader in financial innovation. Foxx explained that the bill supports responsible development in the crypto space and could enhance America's standing in the global financial system. Despite Republican enthusiasm, the narrow majority in the House means that bipartisan support will likely be essential to actually advance the bills. Democratic lawmakers, including Representative Maxine Waters and Senator Adam Schiff, have expressed strong opposition, particularly over Trump's potential conflicts of interest via his family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, and its associated stablecoin, USD1. While the meeting was expected to focus on crypto regulation, the committee’s debate shifted toward discussions on the Department of Defense Appropriations Act. Still, House leaders made it very clear they intend to return to crypto issues soon and hope to pass the three bills before the August congressional recess. Regulators Warn Banks on Crypto Custody Meanwhile, three major US financial regulators—the FDIC, OCC, and Federal Reserve—jointly issued a document with details about the key risks banks face if they choose to custody crypto assets for clients. Part of the document that was shared by regulators While the guidance does not introduce new rules, it provides a risk framework for banks considering entry into the crypto sector. The document pointed out that banks must understand the complexities of digital assets, manage legal and compliance responsibilities, and remain accountable for any third-party custodians they employ. It also stresses the importance of robust audit programs, either internal or external, to ensure safe handling of crypto assets. The guidance was issued at a time when traditional financial institutions are showing more and more interest in crypto. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that a group of large banks is in early discussions to launch a joint stablecoin. Additionally, regulators have signaled a much more open stance toward crypto services by removing the “reputational risk” standard and issuing letters of approval for client-directed crypto transactions. At the same time, crypto-native firms like Ripple and Circle are looking to become regulated banks, which will just blur the lines between traditional banking and the digital asset economy even more. Banks may find the regulatory clarity encouraging, as it opens doors to innovation.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-15 05:30:00

Currently, all eyes are on the PUMP token , which has been demonstrating a fascinating resilience and unique market behavior since its inception. While many new tokens experience wild price swings, PUMP has maintained an unexpected stability, prompting leading on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X to delve deeper into the underlying metrics driving its performance. What makes PUMP different, and why are so many eyes on its journey in the volatile crypto market ? Unpacking PUMP Token’s Remarkable Market Performance The initial insights into the PUMP token ’s market activity paint a compelling picture of strategic planning and community engagement. According to the detailed analysis, the project team initiated the journey with a substantial $4 million in initial liquidity. This was not a one-time injection but rather added in multiple batches, a move that often signals a more thoughtful and long-term approach to market stability rather than a quick pump-and-dump scheme. This foundational liquidity is crucial for any new digital asset, providing a bedrock for trading and reducing extreme volatility in its early stages. What’s even more remarkable is how this initial capital has blossomed. Total liquidity for PUMP has surged to an impressive $50 million. This significant growth, as highlighted by the analyst, is predominantly fueled by the participation of retail investors . This isn’t just a number; it’s a testament to the organic interest and confidence from individual participants who are choosing to put their capital into PUMP. Such grassroots support is often a stronger indicator of a project’s health and potential longevity than mere institutional backing, as it reflects genuine belief from the wider community. Key Liquidity Milestones: Initial Liquidity Provided by Team: $4 million (added in multiple batches) Current Total Liquidity: $50 million (largely from retail participants) Furthermore, a substantial 24% community and ecosystem airdrop allocation is still pending announcement. This future distribution mechanism is a powerful tool for fostering a decentralized community, rewarding early adopters, and encouraging wider adoption. The anticipation of this airdrop could also be contributing to the sustained interest and holding behavior among current token holders, as they await potential benefits and further decentralization of the token’s supply. The Power of Retail Investors in the Crypto Market The narrative around PUMP is heavily influenced by the robust engagement of retail investors . In the broader crypto market , retail participation is a double-edged sword: it can drive massive rallies but also exacerbate crashes. However, in PUMP’s case, it appears to be a source of consistent strength. The fact that a significant portion of the $50 million in total liquidity comes from individual participants suggests a decentralized and resilient base. This contrasts with tokens heavily reliant on a few large whales, which can be prone to sudden, manipulative price movements. Why are retail investors flocking to PUMP? Part of the answer lies in its current valuation. The spot price for PUMP is hovering around $0.0055, which is notably above its public sale price of $0.004. This premium, though seemingly small, means that early public sale participants are already in profit. This positive sentiment from the outset can create a virtuous cycle, attracting more investors and fostering a sense of community success. It also suggests that the initial pricing was well-calibrated, or that demand has simply outstripped initial supply, pushing the price above its launch valuation. Understanding Investor Sentiment: Spot Price: ~$0.0055 Public Sale Price: $0.004 Significance: Early investors are profitable, fostering positive sentiment and attracting new interest. The consistent positive Binance futures funding rate for PUMP further reinforces this bullish sentiment, signaling strong long interest among traders. A positive funding rate means that long position holders are paying short position holders, indicating that the majority of futures traders expect the price to rise and are willing to pay a premium to maintain their long positions. This metric is a powerful real-time indicator of market conviction and can often precede significant price movements. Decoding On-Chain Analysis: What the Data Says About PUMP For those deeply entrenched in the world of digital assets , on-chain analysis provides an unparalleled level of transparency and insight into a token’s health. The data from PUMP is particularly intriguing. Beyond the spot price and funding rates, the stability of Open Interest (OI) in PUMP contracts post-launch is a critical indicator. Open Interest represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled. A stable OI, with both long and short positions holding firm, suggests a balanced market with conviction on both sides, rather than panic selling or speculative over-leveraging. This stability is especially noteworthy given a significant market dynamic: PUMP has not yet been listed on any major centralized spot exchange. Typically, a token’s price can be highly volatile before and immediately after a major exchange listing, often experiencing a “listing pump” followed by a “dump.” PUMP’s ability to maintain a stable price without the liquidity and exposure that a top-tier exchange provides is truly unexpected. This anomaly could be attributed to the strong underlying retail support and the absence of speculative trading that often accompanies major exchange listings, allowing the token to find its organic price floor and build a more stable foundation. On-Chain Insights Table: Metric Observation Implication Binance Futures Funding Rate Remains positive Strong long interest, bullish sentiment among derivatives traders. Open Interest (OI) Stable post-launch Balanced market, conviction from both long and short positions, no panic. Major Exchange Listing None yet for spot trading Unexpected price stability, suggests strong organic demand and holding. Navigating Digital Assets: PUMP’s Path Forward The journey of any new digital asset is fraught with challenges and opportunities. For PUMP, the current stability without major exchange listings presents a unique scenario. On one hand, it demonstrates organic strength and a dedicated community. On the other, a listing on a major exchange could unlock massive liquidity, broader accessibility, and potentially significant price appreciation. The question then becomes: when, and under what circumstances, will such listings occur, and how will the market react? The pending 24% community and ecosystem airdrop also remains a key factor. A well-executed airdrop can significantly boost community engagement and decentralization, but a poorly managed one can lead to sell-offs. The team’s strategy for this allocation will be critical in maintaining the current positive momentum and further solidifying PUMP’s position in the crypto market . Actionable Insights for Investors: Monitor Liquidity Trends: Keep an eye on how total liquidity evolves, especially the proportion contributed by retail. Continued growth signals sustained interest. Watch for Airdrop Announcements: Details on the 24% community allocation will be crucial for understanding future supply dynamics and potential price impact. Anticipate Exchange Listings: While PUMP has shown stability without them, a major exchange listing could be a significant catalyst. Research potential exchanges and their listing criteria. Track Funding Rates & Open Interest: These derivatives metrics provide real-time sentiment indicators. A sustained positive funding rate and stable OI indicate continued bullish conviction. PUMP’s current trajectory offers a compelling case study in organic growth and community-driven success. Its ability to maintain price stability above its public sale price, coupled with strong retail interest and positive futures sentiment, paints a promising picture. While the absence of major spot exchange listings might seem like a hurdle, it has perhaps allowed PUMP to build a more robust, less speculative foundation. As the project moves forward, the pending airdrop and potential future exchange listings will be pivotal moments that could define its long-term success in the competitive digital asset landscape.

Another $269 million came from short-side losses, taking the total liquidation figure to $675.8 million, marking one of the heaviest wipeouts since April. The heaviest blow landed on bitcoin (BTC) longs, which saw over $333 million in forced closures, followed by ether (ETH) at $113 million and XRP at $36 million. Solana’s SOL and dogecoin (DOGE) were also hit, shedding around $14 million each. Dogecoin was the worst-performing major, dropping over 7.6% on the day as speculative froth evaporated. BTC and ETH also fell 3.1% and 2.6%, cooling off after a nearly week-long rally. The largest single liquidation came from a $98.1 million BTC/USDT long on Binance, per liquidation tracker Coinglass. Even as bitcoin trades near record highs, some desks are stepping back from the euphoria. Derivative flows suggest that traders aren’t rushing to chase the upside, and elevated funding rates are making leveraged bets increasingly expensive. The sense is that markets may be due for a breather after an overheated run. ""With BTC in uncharted territory, short-term ceilings remain unclear,"" wrote QCP Capital in a note to clients. ""Funding rates are elevated, and the memory of February’s $2 billion liquidation event still lingers."" Options data paints a picture of cautious optimism, QCP wrote. While short-dated implied volatility ticked higher, it remains well below 2023 averages. September and December risk reversals still favor call options, hinting at longer-term bullishness, though traders appear reluctant to chase upside in the near term. Meanwhile, some analysts are urging traders not to mistake momentum for inevitability. Mounting institutional demand and macro shifts are undeniably fueling the rally, but they’re also raising the stakes. “The road to $150,000 by Q3 looks increasingly plausible, powered by ETF inflows, supply constraints, and macro tailwinds like a weakening dollar and potential Fed cuts,” Bitget’s Ryan Lee said in a note to CoinDesk. “The road to $150,000 by Q3 looks increasingly plausible, powered by supply scarcity and mounting institutional demand. Still, this isn’t a one-way street. Profit-taking, rate speculation, and geopolitical risks could spark a short-term pullback, potentially dragging BTC into a $105,000–$115,000 consolidation zone,” Lee added.

The transfer coincided with a pullback in Bitcoin prices, which slipped from above $123,000 to nearly $117,600, raising fresh questions about whether big players are offloading as retail interest surges. The transaction, flagged by blockchain analytics firm Spot On Chain, is part of a broader sequence of movements from a whale that has held the coins since 2011.

Altogether, 80,000 BTC has shifted hands in recent days, marking the first activity from this wallet in over 14 years. According to Spot On Chain, eight wallets associated with the whale moved 80,000 BTC, worth around $8.68b, after over a decade of silence. Two of these wallets originally received the coins in April and May of 2011, when Bitcoin traded at less than $4. At the time, the total value of the holdings was just $217,800. Today, that stash has multiplied nearly 40,000 times in value. Galaxy Digital Receives Over $2B in BTC Transfers, With Portions Headed to Exchanges Galaxy Digital has emerged as the main destination for these funds. Lookonchain reported that 16,843 BTC, now valued at over $2b, has been transferred to the firm so far. This Bitcoin OG with 80,009 $BTC ($9.46B) transferred another 7,843 $BTC ($927M) to #GalaxyDigital , for a total of 16,843 $BTC ($2B).

As Retail Chases New Highs, Whales Are Preparing to Sell on Binance “While new all-time highs are exciting, the data points to caution. The smart money is moving, and their actions often precede significant market shifts.” – By @Crazzyblockk pic.twitter.com/bA6TX6WKWr — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) July 15, 2025 Analysts Eye Profit-Taking Signals as Dormant Wallets Stir to Life The timing has drawn attention. While retail investors keep buying, encouraged by Bitcoin’s new highs, whales seem to be shifting into profit-taking mode. As a result, some analysts see these transfers as early signs that large holders may be exiting before volatility returns. Notably, the wallet originally acquired Bitcoin at around $2 per coin. This implies a staggering return. Now, the latest movements likely mark the first sell-off by the holder since those early days. As a result, the shift may signal a major change in mindset. Conor Grogan, Coinbase’s head of product, has previously speculated that such reactivations may be due to compromised keys, though he noted the likelihood remains slim. Nevertheless, the reawakening of long-dormant coins has historically sparked caution in the market. For now, the whale still holds about 11,000 BTC, about $1.3b, leaving room for further transfers. Traders are watching closely, wary of what might come next. As more institutional desks handle whale transactions, many suspect these movements are tied to OTC deals rather than direct market sales. Even so, their effect on sentiment is hard to ignore.

Major selloffs occurred during the 14:00–15:00 and 01:00–03:00 windows, with volume spikes of 735.09M and 704.60M, crushing the 24-hour average of 415.48M. A sharp reversal began during the final session hour as DOGE rose 0.84%, from $0.1923 to $0.1939, backed by volume bursts of 22.60M and 19.06M. Institutional activity was visible on both ends of the move, pointing to tactical capital flow rather than retail-driven volatility. News Background The selloff came amid rising anxiety over delays in potential crypto ETF approvals and a sudden resurgence in U.S. enforcement chatter around centralized exchanges. At the same time, market participants began speculating about fast-tracked ETF paths for high-volume tokens like DOGE and XRP, prompting whale-led accumulation near local lows. As a result, DOGE saw rapid directional whiplash — with institutional volumes confirming exits and re-entries. Price Action Summary Range: $0.21 → $0.19 | $0.022 span = 10.44% volatility Breakdown Zones: $0.200–$0.198 during 14:00–15:00 Volume Peaks: 735.09M (14:00), 704.60M (01:00) Support Zone: $0.190–$0.191 during late-session base build Final Hour (03:37–04:36): Price rose from $0.1923 → $0.1939 (+0.84%) Recovery Volume: 22.60M at 04:10, 19.06M at 04:09 during breakout push Technical Analysis Breakdown confirmed by lower-high, lower-low sequence into $0.19 session low Selling intensified as $0.200–$0.201 failed to hold during evening session Final-hour breakout above $0.1930 confirms localized reversal setup Key resistance: $0.1960–$0.1980 for short-term continuation Risk remains elevated if DOGE fails to reclaim $0.200 on sustained volume What Traders Are Watching Can DOGE reclaim the $0.198–$0.200 zone to restore trend structure? Rejection from $0.196 would likely confirm another leg down toward $0.188 Watch for follow-through volume above 400M to confirm trend shift Institutional wallet activity and futures OI positioning remain critical Takeaway DOGE’s 10% plunge was sudden but it wasn’t retail chaos. High-volume breakdowns and targeted re-entries show that institutions are playing both sides. While the bounce offers short-term relief, the macro structure remains vulnerable. Bulls must reclaim $0.200 fast — or risk deeper downside.

This substantial capital injection is earmarked for a unique dual strategy: acquiring both Bitcoin investment and gold. This decision signals a growing confidence in a diversified approach that bridges the traditional with the revolutionary, offering a fascinating glimpse into the future of asset allocation. A Bold Move: Understanding the Bitcoin Investment Strategy The allocation of a significant portion of newly raised funds towards Bitcoin underscores a profound shift in institutional perception. Once dismissed as a speculative digital novelty, Bitcoin has steadily matured into a recognized asset class, often dubbed ‘digital gold.’ Its decentralized nature, finite supply, and increasing adoption as a store of value have made it an attractive hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Growing Institutional Interest: More investment firms are adding Bitcoin to their portfolios, recognizing its potential for significant returns and its role in a diversified asset mix. Inflationary Hedge: With global economies facing inflationary pressures, Bitcoin’s capped supply makes it an appealing counter-asset. Digital Scarcity: Its inherent scarcity, similar to precious metals, provides a strong value proposition in the digital age. Digital Commodities’ move is not just about chasing returns; it’s a strategic positioning to capitalize on the ongoing digital transformation of finance. Their commitment to Bitcoin investment reflects a forward-thinking approach to managing capital in an increasingly digital world. The Timeless Appeal: Reassessing Gold Investment in the Modern Era While Bitcoin represents the new frontier, gold remains a cornerstone of traditional portfolios. Its inclusion in Digital Commodities’ strategy alongside Bitcoin is a testament to its enduring value and its role as a stable asset during turbulent times. Gold has historically served as a reliable safe haven, preserving wealth across generations and acting as a hedge against currency debasement and geopolitical risks. Why combine the oldest form of money with the newest? Diversification: Gold often has a low correlation with other asset classes, providing stability when markets are volatile. Proven Track Record: Centuries of history demonstrate gold’s ability to retain value during economic downturns. Tangible Asset: For many investors, the physical nature of gold offers a sense of security that digital assets cannot replicate. This balanced approach recognizes that while Bitcoin offers exciting growth potential, gold investment provides a time-tested anchor, creating a robust and resilient portfolio. Behind the Scenes: How Digital Commodities Funding Shapes Future Portfolios The $2 million raised by Digital Commodities is more than just capital; it’s a vote of confidence from investors who believe in the firm’s vision of a blended asset strategy. This funding allows Digital Commodities to execute its dual acquisition plan, building a portfolio that aims to capture growth from digital assets while maintaining stability through traditional commodities. The successful Digital Commodities funding round indicates a growing appetite among sophisticated investors for innovative strategies that look beyond conventional investment vehicles. It suggests that financial institutions are increasingly willing to explore and integrate digital assets into their core offerings, recognizing the demand from a new generation of investors seeking exposure to both established and emerging markets. The Best of Both Worlds? Exploring the Crypto Gold Hybrid Model The decision to invest in both Bitcoin and gold positions Digital Commodities at the forefront of a burgeoning trend: the crypto gold hybrid portfolio. This strategy aims to leverage the unique strengths of each asset class to create a more resilient and diversified investment vehicle. While Bitcoin offers exposure to rapid technological advancement and potential exponential growth, gold provides a stable, tangible hedge against various economic uncertainties. Benefits of a Crypto-Gold Hybrid: Enhanced Diversification: Mitigates risks by spreading investments across assets with different risk profiles and market drivers. Dual Hedging: Offers protection against both traditional inflation (gold) and potential fiat currency devaluation (Bitcoin). Broader Market Exposure: Captures value from both the traditional commodity markets and the rapidly expanding digital asset ecosystem. Challenges to Consider: Bitcoin Volatility: While maturing, Bitcoin can still experience significant price swings. Custody and Security: Ensuring the safe storage of both physical gold and digital Bitcoin requires specialized solutions. Regulatory Landscape: The crypto space is still evolving, posing regulatory uncertainties that do not apply to gold. Here’s a comparative look at these two powerful assets: Feature Bitcoin Gold Nature Digital, Decentralized Physical, Centralized Mining Supply Fixed (21 million) Finite, but variable mining Volatility High Moderate to Low Store of Value Emerging ‘Digital Gold’ Traditional ‘Safe Haven’ Accessibility Global, 24/7 Digital Market hours, physical transfer Beyond Tradition: The Expanding Landscape of Alternative Investments Digital Commodities’ strategy is part of a larger narrative where investors are increasingly looking beyond conventional stocks and bonds for growth and stability. The search for alternative investments has gained momentum as traditional markets face unprecedented challenges, including low interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical instability. This has led to a surge of interest in assets like cryptocurrencies, real estate, private equity, and even collectibles. For individual investors, this trend offers a crucial lesson: diversification is key. While not every investor can access specialized funds, understanding the principles behind a crypto-gold hybrid can inform personal portfolio decisions. Consider allocating a portion of your portfolio to assets that are less correlated with traditional markets, whether it’s through direct crypto exposure, gold ETFs, or other alternative assets that align with your risk tolerance. Conclusion: A New Dawn for Diversification Digital Commodities’ $2 million fundraising and its commitment to purchasing Bitcoin and gold mark a pivotal moment in the investment world. It underscores a growing recognition that future-proof portfolios will likely be those that strategically blend the proven stability of traditional assets with the innovative potential of digital currencies. This move is a powerful signal to the market, highlighting the evolving definition of value and the necessity of adapting investment strategies to a dynamic global economy. As the lines between traditional and digital finance continue to blur, firms like Digital Commodities are paving the way for a new era of diversified and resilient wealth management.

48270476,https://timestabloid.com/?p=74377,1752558145,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Canada’s Largest XRP ETF Hits Big Numbers Within First Month,https://timestabloid.com/canadas-largest-xrp-etf-hits-big-numbers-within-first-month/,"In just under a month since its official launch, 3iQ’s XRP ETF has achieved a major milestone, surpassing $50 million in client assets. Traded under the tickers XRPQ and XRPQ.U on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the fund has become the largest XRP-focused ETF in Canada. The fund launched on June 18 and quickly positioned itself as a competitive offering in the Canadian market. The rapid inflow of assets highlights an important trend, which is the growing demand for regulated exposure to XRP among both institutional and retail investors. The Mass Appeal for XRP ETFs in Canada In its official post on X, 3iQ highlighted comments from Pascal St-Jean, President and CEO of the company, who pointed to the ETF’s structure as a key factor in its strong early performance. He said the achievement “shows the continuing strong interest in these assets” and reflects how investors are making more selective choices when allocating capital. Its standout feature, a 0% management fee for the first six months, has also been central to its early success. The ETF is also eligible for tax-advantaged accounts in Canada, including TFSA and RRSP, broadening its appeal to a wider segment of investors. By combining the transparency and accessibility of an exchange-traded fund with zero management fees at launch, this ETF differentiates itself from earlier digital asset products that often came with high costs and limited liquidity. We are proud to announce that our XRP ETF (TSX: XRPQ, XRPQ.U), Canada’s largest #XRP ETF, has accumulated over 50 million USD in client assets since its launch on June 18th. “This significant milestone for our XRP ETF shows the continuing strong interest in these assets and… pic.twitter.com/rpi3BmwE3W — 3iQ Digital Asset Management (@3iq_corp) July 14, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Race for a U.S.-Based XRP ETF The launch of XRPQ comes at a time when market participants are increasingly looking at blockchain-based assets not just for speculative gains, but also for portfolio diversification. Recent activity in the U.S. suggests a heated regulatory race to launch XRP-related exchange‑traded products. Asset managers, including ProShares, Franklin Templeton , Grayscale, and more, have filed with the SEC to introduce spot XRP ETFs, with several key deadlines approaching. Grayscale has also made notable strides in its attempt to convert its Digital Large Cap Fund, which includes XRP, into a spot ETF. While the SEC recently halted the process, Grayscale has revealed that it is working with key stakeholders to meet the SEC’s requirements and launch the product . While the U.S. lacks a dedicated spot XRP ETF, Canada has taken a leadership position, and the interest shown in 3iQ’s offering proves that investors are willing to engage with spot XRP ETFs. The strong debut of XRPQ could influence how future digital asset ETFs are structured, and may also affect future regulation that makes ETF launches easier.

In a market starving for explosive growth, two tokens trading under $0.10—Little Pepe (LILPEPE) and Cronos (CRO)—are now leading a new wave. And with the right timing, a $450 play on these tokens could balloon into $15,000 in just 15 weeks. Here’s why. LILPEPE: The Meme-Tech Rocket with 95x Potential Little Pepe is no ordinary meme coin—it’s the heart of a new Ethereum Layer-2 network focused on speed, scalability, and meme culture utility. LILPEPE is building its launchpad, tax-free ecosystem, sniper bot protection, and more. Its presale is currently in Stage 5 at $0.0014, and over 73.76% of the 5.25 billion tokens allocated have been sold, raising $4.64 million in the process. Once Stage 5 fills up, the price will increase to $0.0015, with the public launch listing set at $0.003—already offering buyers a guaranteed 114.28% gain at launch. But that’s just the beginning. Post-launch projections point toward a potential ATH of $0.134, which would represent a 9,487% surge—or nearly 95x your initial investment. That means $300 in LILPEPE today could realistically grow into $28,500 within the next few months. Add that to a meme coin ecosystem giving away $770,000 worth of tokens to ten lucky winners ($77K each), and you’ve got FOMO written all over it. Even industry insiders are noticing the momentum, with prominent mentions in publications like AInvest and GlobeNewswire , both of which highlight whale movements and heavy retail participation. Investors who jumped in at $0.0010 are already up over 40%. CRO: The ETF-Backed Utility Sleeper Cronos (CRO), the native token of the Crypto.com blockchain, has been in accumulation mode, but that silence has just been broken. Following a 20% daily price surge, CRO is back on the radar, thanks to the hype surrounding its potential inclusion in a new “blue-chip” crypto ETF reportedly backed by Truth Social. This narrative helped CRO climb from $0.08 to $0.09 within hours, as reported by Coinpedia and Crypto. News . The token’s technical indicators are also intense—MACD flips, RSI momentum, and heavy whale inflows suggest a breakout to $0.11 or even $0.13 is within reach. On the fundamentals side, CRO powers an ecosystem of over 80 million users across the Crypto.com app, DeFi, and NFTs. According to a recent forecast by Cryptopolitan , CRO could average $0.0963–$0.1076 in the near term, with some price models suggesting upside to $0.26 in a bullish environment. On Reddit , users are even speculating that a run to $1 is a long-term possibility. So if you allocate $150 to CRO and it doubles or triples, you’re looking at a return of $300–$450, safely balancing the rocket-like trajectory of LILPEPE with something grounded. Why Dogecoin Can’t Keep Up At around $0.30, Dogecoin has already lost most of its speculative punch. Even if it doubles or triples, you’re still looking at gains capped at 2x to 3x, and that’s assuming Elon Musk tweets something exciting. In contrast, both LILPEPE and CRO have serious catalysts brewing. LILPEPE is driving community virality, whale accumulation, and Layer 2 development simultaneously. CRO is benefiting from rising institutional exposure, strong fundamentals, and surging user adoption. That combination—speed and strength—makes a $450 portfolio (split between $300 in LILPEPE and $150 in CRO) a seriously compelling bet. How $450 Becomes $15,000 If LILPEPE surges to $0.134 post-launch as projected, $300 becomes $28,500. If CRO doubles or triples from its current position, $150 becomes $300–$450. Together, you’re looking at a real possibility of turning $450 into $15,000 or more. And best of all? The timeline is short. With presale Stage 5 nearly 74% filled, the window is rapidly closing. LILPEPE’s listing is right around the corner, and CRO’s chart is heating up. Conclusion: Choose Momentum, Not Memory Dogecoin had its run. But nostalgia doesn’t generate returns—strategy does. Currently, that strategy points to LILPEPE and CRO. One delivers the hype and heat, the other the utility and adoption. The blend is perfect. If you’ve been sitting on the sidelines, wondering when the next big move will come, this is it. Don’t watch it happen. Position yourself before the fireworks begin.

The bloc has targeted $84 billion worth of U.S. goods, including automobiles, Boeing aircraft, and bourbon, amid heightened global trade tensions. A 206-page list issued by the European Commission on Monday showed that the bloc’s finalized countermeasures are also directed towards machinery products, plastics, chemicals, electrical equipment, medical devices, agricultural goods, and wine. According to the list, the EU didn’t include tariff rates for the goods.

The U.S. imposed reciprocal levies on most EU goods and added 25% tariffs on automobiles and auto parts. The U.S. later settled on a baseline 10% rate to allow for trade negotiations with nations globally. Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke also mentioned at a news conference in Brussels on Monday that Trump’s tariff threat was unacceptable. The bloc accused the U.S. of being reluctant to settle for trade negotiations and warned it of issuing countermeasures if no deal is reached by August 1. The U.S. President warned over the weekend he would raise the bloc’s levies to 30% if there are no trade deals before the deadline on August 1. Trump acknowledged that he is open to further discussions with the bloc and other trading partners. “They would like to do a different kind of a deal and we’re always open to talk, including Europe. In fact, they’re coming over. They’d like to talk.” -Donald Trump, U.S President. The European Union initially issued the list targeting U.S. goods worth 95 billion euros, but it was minimized after dialogue with countries and firms within the bloc. The EU also requires its 27 nations to give their approval before the adoption of the list. The 27-nation bloc had previously issued countermeasures of 21 billion euros on U.S. imports but later extended it to counter Trump’s additional tariffs on steel and aluminum. Italy’s Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani revealed over the weekend that the EU was ready with roughly $24.5B worth of countermeasures against U.S. goods if both parties failed to reach a deal. The EU also plans to tariff over 65 billion euros of industrial goods, including 11 billion euros on aircraft, approximately 9.4 billion euros on machinery, and roughly 8 billion euros on cars. The EU also targeted 6 billion euros on agricultural products, including 2 billion euros on fruits and vegetables and around 1.2 billion euros on alcoholic beverages. The 27-nation bloc also issued 500 million euros on toys and hobby equipment, 200 million euros on musical instruments, and more than 300 million euros on sports guns.

He believes there is still a chance for continued negotiations, but argued that the bloc is yet to settle on a good deal with its largest trading partner. Sefcovic revealed on Monday that there are more plans to meet with the Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum mentioned that she is hopeful for a trade deal on security with the U.S. Trump has accused the country of not making more effort towards combating fentanyl flow into the U.S., adding that the 30% tariff on Mexico would not apply to goods shipped under the USMCA trade agreement. She also maintained that no deal will include the U.S. forces entering Mexican borders, as mentioned by Trump. South Korea officials stated Monday that Trump’s deadline made it impossible to reach a deal and offered to expand access of its agricultural market to the U.S. Seoul’s Minister for Trade Yeo Han-Koo also acknowledged that the country was cautious to avoid heightened U.S. levies on major industries that would undermine the economic relationship with its main trading partner.

Investors remained focused on ongoing trade talks, while also anticipating key U.S. inflation data and a wave of bank earnings later in the week. On the geopolitical front, US President Donald Trump reiterated openness to renewed tariff negotiations with the European Union and other key trading partners. Geopolitical tensions added to the uncertainty after President Trump threatened to impose secondary tariffs of 100% on Russia unless a peace agreement with Ukraine is reached within 50 days. Gold prices rose to around $3,360 per ounce on Tuesday, as concerns over the impact of US President Donald Trump's tariff war enhanced the metal’s safe-haven appeal. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.24% to below 39,430 while the broader Topix Index rose 0.5% to 2,837 on Tuesday, with Japanese shares showing mixed performances. The Japanese yen hovered around 147.6 per dollar on Tuesday, near its lowest level in two months, as persistent trade-related tensions weighed on sentiment. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.65% slipping 0.2% to around 3,510 while the Shenzhen Component rose 0.4% to 10,730, as investors digested a raft of economic data that painted a mixed picture of the recovery, and the offshore yuan steady to around 7.17 per dollar on Tuesday, pausing gains for the second consecutive session. China’s economy expanded 5.2% yoy in Q2 2025 , slowing from 5.4% in the prior two quarters and marking the slowest pace since Q3 2024. China's industrial production rebounded strongly in June 2025, with a 6.8% year-on-year increase, marks a significant acceleration from May's 5.8%. China's retail sales increased by 4.8% year-on-year in June 2025, slowing from over one-year high of 6.4% and missing market expectations of a 5.6% gain. China’s fixed-asset investment rose by 2.8% year-on-year in the first half of 2025, coming in below market forecasts of a 3.7% growth. China’s surveyed unemployment rate stood at 5.0% in June 2025, unchanged from the previous month and in line with market expectations. China’s industrial capacity utilization rate decreased to 74 percent in the second quarter of 2025 from 74.9 percent in the same period a year earlier, marking the lowest rate since the first quarter of 2020. China’s new home prices in 70 cities declined by 3.2% year-on-year in June 2025, slowing from a 3.5% drop in the previous month. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 0.36% to 24,244 around midday Tuesday, snapping a three-session winning streak. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.24% to 82,390 in early trade on Tuesday, snapping a four-session losing streak. The index attempted to rebound from its three-week low touched the previous day, supported by hopes of a potential US-India trade deal. Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said on Monday that negotiations with the US are expected to result in a ""win-win"" trade-complementing agreement. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.59% to 8,623 on Tuesday, rebounding from a modest decline in the prior session and reaching its highest level in over a month. The Australian dollar edged higher to around $0.654 on Tuesday, following a notable decline in the previous session. Domestically, sentiment was further buoyed by positive economic data, with the Westpac-Melbourne Institute Consumer Sentiment Index rising by 0.6% month-on-month to 93.1 in July 2025, following a 0.5% uptick in June. Investors are now turning their attention to key domestic data releases later this week, including consumer inflation expectations and the latest employment figures. In the U.S., on Thursday, all three major indexes ended slightly higher as investors weighed renewed tariff threats from President Trump against optimism over upcoming earnings and inflation data. President Donald Trump urged the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates to 1%, arguing it would reduce federal borrowing costs and boost economic growth. “We need a 1% rate. The Fed is killing growth,” he said on Monday. Investors now await the US CPI report, due later today, for more clues into the Fed's rate path. U.S. stock futures slightly higher on Tuesday as investors turned cautious ahead of major bank earnings and a closely watched inflation report: Dow +0.08% ; S&P 500 +0.30% ; Nasdaq +0.49% .

Users need BNB and Alpha Points to join events; buy orders remain locked until event ends. Binance enters the bonding curve race as meme coin platforms like LetsBONK surpass Pump.fun in activity. New Token Event Model Debuts on Binance Wallet Binance has introduced a new pricing model for token generation events (TGEs) through its Wallet. The system follows a bonding curve structure, where token prices move higher as more users buy during the event window. Meanwhile, this approach mirrors the mechanism used by Pump.fun and was developed in partnership with meme coin launchpad Four.Meme. Binance confirmed that this is the first time it has offered such a model. The first project using this setup will be announced on July 15 via the Binance Wallet X account. We’re redefining token launches with the introduction of the Exclusive Bonding Curve-Based Token Generation Event (TGE) on Binance Wallet, in collaboration with https://t.co/a6yKhb5iK9 . The first project to use this Bonding Curve TGE model will be revealed tomorrow. Know more… pic.twitter.com/uQ36m0Vwsb — Binance (@binance) July 14, 2025 Live Pricing and Locked Orders During Events The new format allows users to buy and trade non-transferable tokens with BNB while the event is live. Prices rise automatically based on real-time demand. Once the event ends, the tokens can be transferred and traded on Binance Alpha. Users will not be able to cancel orders once they are placed. BNB used for purchases stays locked until the event closes. Binance described the structure as one that offers a more open way to determine token value before a full market listing. To take part, users need a balance of Binance Alpha Points along with BNB in their Wallet. Alpha Points are part of Binance’s internal system used to score eligibility based on platform activity. The goal is to make access more consistent for active users while limiting automated trades during the token event.

As excitement builds around the BTC Bull presale, bold price predictions are also picking up speed. Supporters highlight the growing trade volume and interest from early buyers, while others are cautious, pointing out familiar meme coin patterns. At the same time, BlockDAG (BDAG) is taking a smarter path. It’s made for those who want more access upfront, not delays. With $338 M raised, 2 million+ X1 miner users, and a clear plan already rolling, BlockDAG is focused on action, not hype. BTC Bull Rockets 82% In One Day BTC Bull’s price jumped 82% in a single day, grabbing attention and reigniting interest from meme coin enthusiasts. The coin now trades around $0.0055. Traders are circling, driven by renewed volume and social media chatter. Bold BTC Bull price predictions are emerging by the hour. However, underneath the buzz, the project lacks structure. Like most meme coins, it’s fueled by community sentiment and market timing. There’s no clear plan, no unique function, just rapid spikes that thrill short-term buyers but worry long-term holders. That doesn’t make BTC Bull a bad play, it just carries risk. If momentum holds, it could climb further. If not, it may fade as another flash in the meme coin game. For now, it’s loud, fast, and full of hype. BlockDAG’s $338M Presale Confirms Growing Demand and Early Strength BlockDAG is taking a more tactical route. With the BEAT VESTING PASS, buyers can unlock 80% of their coins at launch instead of the usual 40%. That offers much greater flexibility and freedom for early participants. BlockDAG has raised $338 million through its presale and is entering Batch 29, priced at $0.0276 per coin. So far, 23.8 billion coins have been sold. People who bought in Batch 1 are seeing a staggering 2,660% gain compared to the original Batch 29 price. The launch price is set at $0.05. As part of the GLOBAL LAUNCH release, the current purchase price is $0.0016 until August 11, one of the lowest price. If users buy now, they could see a 3,025% return based on the $0.05 launch price. The BEAT VESTING PASS applies only to non‑bonus coins: 80% of non‑bonus coins are unlocked at launch. Bonus coins are excluded from this early release. This isn’t just a marketing gimmick, it’s a clear strategy to give participants control from day one. No long lockups, no slow schedules. Buyers know exactly what they’re getting and when they’ll get it. Supported by $338 M raised, momentum from 2 million+ X1 miner app users, and a roadmap already in motion, BlockDAG is prioritizing delivery over hype. In a market where timing and clarity matter, the BEAT VESTING PASS offers real structure and a strong foundation. Long-Term Growth Favors BlockDAG Over Bull BTC Bull is enjoying a moment in the spotlight. With a fast price rise and meme-level attention online, it’s grabbing short-term interest. But these trends often come and go. BTC Bull still lacks a roadmap, defined purpose, or a real use case that could hold value long-term. It’s riding hype, but that alone isn’t enough to sustain real momentum once excitement fades. In contrast, BlockDAG offers a more grounded approach. With its BEAT VESTING PASS, early participants get to unlock 80% of non-bonus coins at launch, giving them more control right from the start. It’s a presale with structure, not just noise. Backed by $338 M raised, strong community traction, and over 2 million X1 miner app users, BlockDAG is built for those looking beyond the hype toward steady, long-term potential. Conclusion BTC Bull is creating buzz, thanks to its sharp 82% price spike and viral chatter. But buzz fades fast if it isn’t backed by something solid. For BTC Bull to maintain attention, it needs more than social media excitement. It needs real features, community trust, and a clear reason for people to stay. Without those, it may just become another meme coin that shined briefly before fading out. BlockDAG, however, is offering more than just talk. Its BEAT VESTING PASS gives early participants 80% of their non-bonus coins unlocked at launch, providing more freedom and movement from day one. Add to that a $338 M presale raise, growing app users, and a transparent roadmap, it shows strong planning. While meme coins chase hype, BlockDAG focuses on real delivery and long-term value from launch day onward.

The bank also predicts an “upside scenario” for Bitcoin of $155,000 by December 2025. In a research report released today, TD Cowen attributed its optimism for Strategy stock to the company's massive Bitcoin portfolio and potential price increases. The company recently purchased an additional 4,225 BTC for $472.5 million, bringing its total BTC holdings to 601,550. The average unit cost for these purchases was $111,827. Related News: Another Country Announces Plan to Create Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Fund TD Cowen believes the company's aggressive BTC accumulation plans could yield significant long-term returns. The report stated, “This strategy, initially launched to protect the value of reserve assets, has now evolved into an opportunistic approach aimed at increasing shareholder value.” The firm's baseline scenario is for Bitcoin to reach around $128,000 in December. A potential “downside” scenario sees the price at $55,000. Today, BTC broke a new record, surpassing $120,000 for the first time in history. The strategy aims to raise a total of $84 billion through debt and equity for future Bitcoin acquisitions under its “42/42 plan.” TD Cowen predicts that this strategy could generate approximately 900,000 BTC for the company by the end of 2027. *This is not investment advice.

With July bringing fresh volatility and major headlines across crypto, the race for early access is on. The best part? These top cryptos to join in 2025 aren’t just riding old trends. They’re shaping the narrative, drawing in a new wave of investors, and igniting serious buzz on crypto forums and social channels. As the market preps for the next bull run, it’s not just about catching up, it’s about getting ahead. Here’s a close look at four top cryptos to join in 2025 that are making waves right now, including one meme coin whose exclusive whitelist is sparking a rush for early spots. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU): Unstoppable Bull Energy and Early Access Hype MoonBull isn’t just another Ethereum meme coin. It’s built for those chasing major upside, with a structure designed for high-octane community energy. What’s turning heads? MoonBull’s whitelist is live, but only for a limited time, and those who get in now are the ones unlocking all the benefits.

Why MoonBull Keeps Making the List of Top Cryptos to Join in 2025 The combination of hype, exclusive perks, and true scarcity is building moon bull’s reputation as the go-to project for high-energy traders this summer.

Pepe (PEPE): The Deflationary Meme Coin That Won’t Quit Pepe exploded onto the Ethereum scene as a tribute to the internet’s legendary frog meme. Its simple, pure memecoin status, no tax, no hidden agenda, keeps the appeal honest and raw. Pepe has become a staple in meme coin circles, drawing in degens and crypto enthusiasts looking for that perfect blend of nostalgia and viral potential. What keeps Pepe in the headlines? Its deflationary model means the supply drops over time, creating constant buying pressure. Community support, combined with relentless meme power, has allowed PEPE to carve out its own lane. In July, the chatter around top cryptos to join in 2025 includes Pepe not for utility or tech, but because it thrives on buzz and market momentum. Why did this coin make it to this list? Pepe’s relentless energy and status as a pure, crowd-driven meme coin prove that, in the right market, simplicity and meme magic are enough to keep a project trending and growing. 3. Bonk (BONK): The People’s Dog Coin on Solana Launched on the Solana blockchain, Bonk stands out as the first dog-themed coin that put the power directly into the hands of its community. With half of its total supply airdropped to Solana users, Bonk is all about fair access and breaking the mold of “toxic” tokenomics. This transparency and inclusivity are exactly what’s helping Bonk trend as one of the top cryptos to join in 2025. Bonk’s popularity has been growing with the Solana ecosystem. Community engagement is at the heart of every move, from airdrops to ongoing upgrades. As more traders look beyond Ethereum for the next wave of meme coin potential, Bonk’s accessibility and strong narrative are pushing it onto must-watch lists everywhere. Why did this coin make it to this list? Bonk is proof that community-first models can capture serious market attention and hold it, especially when fair launches and viral stories align. 4. Dogwifhat (WIF): Solana’s Viral Sensation Is Gaining Steam Dogwifhat has become a household name for Solana meme coin fans. Launched in late 2023, this Shiba Inu coin, complete with its signature knitted hat, quickly captured the hearts (and wallets) of meme traders everywhere. Built on Solana, Dogwifhat combines fast, low-fee transactions with a pop-culture-friendly mascot. Dogwifhat’s rise is fueled by organic social hype and a strong “viral” energy, making it a favorite among younger traders. Its position as one of the top cryptos to join in 2025 comes from both its community loyalty and its creative approach to branding. Why did this coin make it to this list? Dogwifhat is living proof that when a meme coin combines strong branding, rapid adoption, and passionate holders, it can jump from newcomer to headline maker in record time.

48272072,https://timestabloid.com/?p=74386,1752560205,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Predicts Timeline for XRP to Reach A New All-Time High,https://timestabloid.com/expert-predicts-timeline-for-xrp-to-reach-a-new-all-time-high/,"XRP is once again under intense market focus as it faces the $3 resistance. The asset is currently trading at $2.87, marking a 26% increase from the previous week. Over the last 24 hours, XRP has tested the $3 level multiple times, fueling renewed speculation about its immediate future. Amid this volatility, crypto expert Edoardo Farina shared a bold projection, stating, “XRP could make a new all-time high within 48h.” $XRP COULD MAKE A NEW ALL TIME HIGH WITHIN 48H — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) July 14, 2025 Farina’s prediction arrives at a pivotal moment for XRP, as it continues its sustained rally amid a broader crypto resurgence. XRP reached its all-time high of $3.84 in January 2018, and the closest it has come since then was January 2025 when it hit $3.35. However, Farina is confident that it will surpass $3.84 over the next 48 hours. The asset’s recent strength follows a series of technical confirmations , and Farina’s prediction adds urgency to the outlook, implying that a major milestone may be closer than many anticipated. Community Excitement for XRP Reactions from the XRP community show optimism and confidence that Farina’s prediction will come true. One commenter emphasized how fast the market environment is evolving, and rapid shifts in sentiment could lead to significant outcomes in a short time frame. This aligns with XRP’s historical tendency to move quickly once key resistance levels are broken. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Other responses also expressed hope that Farina’s projection will materialize soon. Some welcomed the forecast but remained reserved, signaling a wait-and-see approach. Others offered direct affirmations of the token’s future, confidently stating that XRP could climb even higher. Will XRP Surpass $3.84? Supporters also pointed to fundamental drivers backing the price movement. One user cited the combination of regulatory clarity, global partnerships, and real-world utility as reasons he has maintained a strong conviction in XRP over the years. The same user suggested that what lies ahead may serve as validation for that stance, should Farina’s prediction materialize. A well-known crypto millionaire recently highlighted $3 as the neckline for a cup-and-handle pattern that could push XRP to $5.2 once the breakout is confirmed. As XRP approaches the $3 threshold, all eyes are on whether it can sustain momentum and surpass its previous high. Farina has consistently advised against selling XRP early , and the next two days could prove to be defining ones for the digital asset and those who took his advice to hold their tokens.

Key Takeaways: Bit Digital plans to raise $67.3 million through a direct share offering to buy more Ethereum. The company recently converted its entire Bitcoin holdings to Ether. Bit Digital’s move aligns with growing institutional interest in Ethereum amid a rising crypto market. The proceeds will be used exclusively to purchase Ethereum, further expanding the company’s growing ETH treasury, the firm said in a Monday announcement . Priced at $3.06 per share, the offering is managed by B. Riley Securities and is expected to close around July 15. Bit Digital Converts Entire Bitcoin Holdings to Ethereum The move follows Bit Digital’s recent decision to convert its entire Bitcoin holdings into Ether , reflecting a strategic pivot toward Ethereum. As of early July, the firm held roughly 100,603 ETH, valued at approximately $301 million. Bit Digital offers a range of services including validator operations, enterprise custody, and yield optimization. It began building its Ethereum stake and engaging in staking activities in 2022, signaling a long-term commitment to the Ethereum ecosystem. In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Bit Digital disclosed its preliminary estimated revenue for the second quarter to be between $24.3 million and $26.9 million. Despite a slight dip in its stock price by 1.2% to close at $3.29 on Monday, shares have risen more than 32% over the last month. Ethereum’s price has also gained momentum, rising 0.6% to $2,991 and climbing over 18% in the past week amid a broad crypto market rally. Meanwhile, Bitcoin remained relatively flat, dipping slightly to $118,852. Bit Digital’s latest capital raise and strategic shift toward Ethereum comes amid growing institutional interest in the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. Bit Digital CEO: ""This is why we switched from Bitcoin mining to a 100% Ethereum treasury strategy…"" pic.twitter.com/dz7HB6Ldf6 — Traders Paradise (@theparadiselive) July 15, 2025 On Monday, SharpLink Gaming increased its Ethereum holdings with a fresh acquisition valued at nearly $49 million. As reported, the company received 16,374 ETH on Sunday afternoon, sourced from a wallet that had recently purchased the tokens from Galaxy Digital’s over-the-counter market. Last week, Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin said the company has been purchasing tens of millions of dollars worth of ETH every day. “We are accumulating more and more consistently — we’re able to acquire tens of millions of dollars in Ether a day,” Lubin told CNBC. More Public Companies Diversify into Crypto Following the model pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, more public companies are diversifying into crypto holdings that include BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP. Just recently, BIT Mining announced plans to raise between $200 million and $300 million to build a Solana (SOL) treasury as part of a broader expansion into the fast-growing blockchain ecosystem. Last week, DeFi Development Corp. revealed that it has acquired $2.7 million worth of Solana as part of its aggressive crypto treasury strategy.
