In his latest video update, the analyst identified ADA’s recent technical breakout as a clear sign of bullish momentum, forecasting a price target of $1.90 in the coming weeks if momentum holds. Cardano Bull Run Is Back On Investing Broz began the segment by reiterating the broader context: Bitcoin’s explosive rally above the $120,000 mark has reignited speculation around the arrival of altseason. “This is just one more egg in the basket of potentially altcoin season coming very soon,” he noted, citing Bitcoin dominance breaking below a critical support level and altcoins “going berserk.” Related Reading: Cardano Price Explodes 30% In Past Week — Analyst Calls $5 Next Market Top Among the altcoins leading the charge, Cardano stood out. The analyst confirmed that he purchased ADA in the past 24 hours, identifying the move as more than just opportunistic. The trigger? A confirmed breakout above a long-standing resistance level that ADA hadn’t pierced since March 1. “This is a major win for Cardano holders who are trading it,” he said, explaining that a falling wedge pattern had been developing for weeks and now signaled a shift in trend. Investing Broz’s trading group had initially positioned long at $0.54, with a modest target of $0.80. But as he emphasized, “Cardano is not just breaking above the smaller resistance level—we’re breaking above a resistance level we haven’t been back above since March.” That March breakout, he reminded viewers, was spurred by a now-infamous Donald Trump tweet listing altcoins deemed suitable for a proposed American crypto reserve. While that spike proved short-lived, the current breakout is, in his view, fundamentally and technically sound. To calculate a realistic upside scenario, he applied the traditional breakout target technique by measuring the height of the formation and projecting it forward. “This would give you a Cardano price prediction of $1.90,” he stated, while also noting that such a target might be ambitious for a summer timeframe. Still, “it’s absolutely doable and definitely something you guys should be keeping an eye on.” Related Reading: The Last Time This Happened Cardano Rose 55%, ADA Analyst Makes Bold The analyst reinforced his bullish outlook using confirmation from the LuxAlgo indicator suite, which flashed a weekly buy signal—featuring a green reversal, bullish momentum, and positive money flow. Based on this, he offered a more immediate price range between $1.00 and $1.80. “I don’t think we’re going to stop at $1.80, but I think it’s a target to keep an eye on if you’re looking for a trade,” he said. Beyond that, a golden pocket Fibonacci extension points to a key level of $2.42 by year’s end. However, Investing Broz was quick to clarify that these are not his full-cycle targets for ADA. “This is not my long-term bullish price prediction for this bull market,” he emphasized. “This is simply tradable movements that I still think can happen over the next couple of weeks.” His earlier predictions suggested ADA could hit $7 to $10 by the cycle top—possibly extending into 2026 or even 2027. Throughout the segment, he stressed the importance of knowing when to take profit. “Every bull market has volatility. Cardano… is going to have volatile movements where they rally and then pull back,” he advised. For short-term traders, targets around $1.80 to $2.40 may present ideal levels to secure gains or even explore short positions if momentum wanes. While ADA is not the only altcoin the analyst is tracking—Ono and HAR were also highlighted for similar breakout behavior—Cardano’s confluence of technical strength, historical resistance flip, and volume surge make it a standout in the current environment. As the analyst concluded, “There’s still time… this is a major breakout, and if you’re a trader, this is what you wait for.” Cardano, for now, has flashed its signal. Whether it makes good on the $1.90 target may depend not only on its own momentum, but on the broader timing of altseason’s long-awaited arrival. At press time, ADA stood at $0.7447.

When major economic blocs clash, the reverberations are felt across all asset classes, including the volatile crypto market. Recently, whispers of a brewing US Trade War have turned into a loud declaration, with the European Union signaling its readiness to unleash a massive wave of EU Tariffs . This isn’t just about goods and services; it’s about investor sentiment, market stability, and ultimately, the future trajectory of your digital assets. Understanding the Looming Threat of EU Tariffs The European Union, through its seasoned European Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security, Maroš Šefčovič, has made a stern announcement: a staggering 72 billion euros ($84 billion) in additional EU Tariffs are on the table. This isn’t a speculative threat but a calculated response to potential actions from the United States. The EU’s stance is clear: if trade talks with the U.S. falter, these tariffs will be imposed on U.S. imports. This substantial figure underscores the seriousness with which the EU views the escalating trade dispute, highlighting their commitment to protecting their economic interests. These potential tariffs are not merely punitive; they are a strategic measure designed to create leverage and deter aggressive trade policies from the other side. Historically, tariffs have been a double-edged sword. While intended to protect domestic industries, they often lead to higher consumer prices, reduced trade volumes, and retaliatory measures from trading partners. The EU’s proposed tariffs would target a wide range of American goods, potentially impacting various sectors from agriculture to technology. The specific products targeted are often chosen for their political or economic sensitivity, aiming to maximize pressure on the opposing nation. The Spark: The US Trade War and Its Origins To fully grasp the current situation, it’s essential to look back at the catalyst. The specter of a US Trade War was first raised prominently when then-U.S. President Donald Trump announced his intention to impose a hefty 30% tariff on EU imports, effective August 1. This move was part of a broader ‘America First’ economic policy, which prioritized domestic production and aimed to reduce trade deficits by making imported goods more expensive. Trump’s administration had previously imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from various countries, including EU members, and had threatened tariffs on automobiles, among other sectors. This aggressive posture ignited a series of tit-for-tat exchanges, where one nation’s tariff imposition was met with a similar measure from the other. The underlying philosophy behind such actions is often to force renegotiation of trade agreements deemed unfair. However, the practical outcome frequently involves increased costs for businesses and consumers, supply chain disruptions, and heightened uncertainty in global markets. The threat of a 30% tariff from the U.S. on EU imports was particularly alarming due to its significant percentage and broad potential impact across European industries. Key Aspects of the Initial US Tariff Threat: Targeted Goods: While not explicitly detailed in the initial announcement, such tariffs typically target a wide array of goods, from industrial machinery to consumer products, impacting various sectors within the EU. High Percentage: A 30% tariff is substantial, making U.S. goods significantly more expensive for European consumers and businesses, potentially reducing demand. Unilateral Action: The announcement reflected a unilateral approach to trade policy, often bypassing traditional multilateral trade dispute resolution mechanisms. Economic Nationalism: It underscored a broader shift towards economic nationalism, where domestic industries are prioritized, even at the expense of international trade relations. The Mechanism of Retaliatory Tariffs: A Dangerous Cycle The EU’s preparation of 72 billion euros in additional duties is a classic example of Retaliatory Tariffs . These are duties imposed by a country on imported goods from another country in response to the latter imposing tariffs on its exports. It’s essentially an economic tit-for-tat, designed to exert pressure and signal a strong response to perceived unfair trade practices. The goal is to make the initial aggressor reconsider their stance, but it often leads to an escalating cycle that can harm both economies involved. When one major economic power imposes tariffs, the affected party has several options: accept the tariffs, challenge them through international bodies like the World Trade Organization (WTO), or impose their own retaliatory tariffs. The EU’s decision to prepare such a significant package indicates their preference for the latter, aiming to match the U.S. in economic leverage. The selection of goods for these Retaliatory Tariffs is strategic, often targeting products from politically sensitive regions or industries within the aggressor nation, aiming to maximize political pressure. Potential Impacts of Retaliatory Tariffs: Stakeholder Potential Impact Consumers Higher prices for imported goods, reduced variety. Businesses (Importers/Exporters) Increased costs, reduced competitiveness, disrupted supply chains, potential job losses. Governments Increased revenue from tariffs (initially), but potential for reduced overall economic growth and political friction. Global Economy Slower trade growth, increased uncertainty, potential for recession. Why Do Global Trade Tensions Matter to Everyone? Beyond the immediate financial implications for businesses involved in import and export, rising Global Trade Tensions have far-reaching consequences that affect every individual, even those not directly involved in international trade. These tensions create an environment of uncertainty, which is kryptonite for economic growth and investor confidence. When major economies are at odds, it disrupts established supply chains, leading to higher production costs and, ultimately, increased prices for consumers. This phenomenon, known as inflation, erodes purchasing power and can lead to a general slowdown in economic activity. Moreover, persistent trade disputes can strain diplomatic relations, making it harder for nations to cooperate on other critical global issues like climate change, cybersecurity, or public health crises. The interconnectedness of the modern world means that a trade dispute between two major players like the EU and the U.S. can send shockwaves across continents, affecting emerging markets, commodity prices, and even the stability of financial systems. It’s not just about tariffs; it’s about trust, stability, and the fundamental rules governing international commerce. Consider the ripple effect: a company reliant on imported components faces higher costs due to tariffs. To maintain profit margins, they might pass these costs onto consumers, or they might seek alternative, potentially lower-quality, suppliers. This can lead to a decline in product quality or an increase in prices for end-users. Similarly, exporters facing retaliatory tariffs find their products more expensive and less competitive in foreign markets, potentially leading to reduced sales and job cuts. This web of consequences illustrates why Global Trade Tensions are a concern for policymakers, businesses, and citizens alike. Analyzing the Broad Economic Impact on Markets, Including Crypto The potential Economic Impact of an escalating trade war between the EU and the U.S. cannot be overstated. In traditional financial markets, such tensions typically lead to increased volatility, with investors seeking safe-haven assets like gold or certain government bonds. Equity markets often react negatively to news of tariffs, as they signal reduced corporate profits and economic uncertainty. Currency markets can also experience significant fluctuations as traders anticipate changes in trade balances and capital flows. For the cryptocurrency market, the implications are multifaceted. While often seen as a hedge against traditional financial instability, crypto assets are not immune to macro-economic shocks. In times of heightened global uncertainty, Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies can exhibit dual behaviors: Risk-Off Asset: Sometimes, Bitcoin acts as a ‘digital gold,’ with investors flocking to it during periods of geopolitical or economic instability, viewing it as a decentralized alternative to traditional safe havens. Risk-On Asset: At other times, especially during sharp market downturns, crypto can behave like a ‘risk-on’ asset, falling in tandem with equities as investors liquidate assets across the board to cover losses or move to cash. An escalating trade war would likely lead to a general risk-off sentiment across global markets. This could initially put downward pressure on cryptocurrencies as investors reduce exposure to all perceived ‘risky’ assets. However, if the traditional financial system shows signs of deeper distress, the narrative of crypto as a decentralized alternative could gain traction, potentially leading to a resurgence in demand. The key is increased volatility and unpredictability, making informed decision-making crucial for crypto investors. Potential Economic Impact Scenarios: Reduced Global Growth: Tariffs act as taxes, increasing costs and reducing demand, which can lead to a slowdown in global economic expansion. Inflationary Pressures: Higher import costs are often passed on to consumers, leading to rising prices for goods and services. Supply Chain Disruptions: Businesses may struggle to source components or sell products across borders, forcing costly reconfigurations. Investor Uncertainty: Ambiguity surrounding trade policies makes investors hesitant, leading to reduced investment and market volatility. Currency Fluctuations: Trade imbalances can lead to significant shifts in currency values, impacting international trade and investment. Navigating the Storm: Challenges and Actionable Insights The prospect of a full-blown trade war presents significant challenges for businesses, consumers, and investors alike. The primary challenge is the unpredictability of outcomes. Trade disputes can escalate rapidly, or they can be resolved through last-minute negotiations. This uncertainty makes long-term planning difficult. For businesses, it means rethinking supply chains, sourcing strategies, and market entry points. For consumers, it could mean higher prices and fewer choices. For investors, it necessitates a careful re-evaluation of portfolio risk. Key Challenges: Uncertainty: The fluid nature of trade negotiations makes it hard to predict the duration and intensity of disputes. Supply Chain Fragility: Globalized supply chains are vulnerable to disruptions from tariffs, leading to delays and increased costs. Market Volatility: Financial markets, including crypto, will likely experience heightened swings in response to trade news. Erosion of Trust: Trade disputes can damage international cooperation and trust, impacting future collaborations. Actionable Insights for Investors: While the broader geopolitical landscape is beyond individual control, investors can adopt strategies to mitigate risks and potentially capitalize on opportunities: Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider a mix of traditional assets and cryptocurrencies. Within crypto, diversify across different asset classes (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, DeFi tokens). Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on geopolitical developments and trade talks. Understanding the macro environment is crucial for making informed investment decisions. Follow reputable news sources and economic analyses. Risk Management: Implement strict risk management strategies. This includes setting stop-loss orders, avoiding over-leveraging, and only investing what you can afford to lose. Look for Resilience: In crypto, consider projects with strong fundamentals, real-world utility, and robust development teams that might be more resilient to market downturns driven by external factors. Stablecoins, for instance, can offer a temporary refuge during periods of high volatility. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility is inevitable, maintaining a long-term perspective can help weather the storm. Focus on the underlying technology and adoption trends of cryptocurrencies. A Compelling Summary: The Interconnectedness of Our World The EU’s readiness to impose 72 billion euros in Retaliatory Tariffs against the U.S. is a stark reminder of the delicate balance in global trade relations. What begins as a dispute over specific goods can quickly escalate into a full-blown US Trade War , casting a long shadow over the entire global economy. These EU Tariffs are not just numbers on a balance sheet; they represent potential disruptions to supply chains, increased costs for consumers, and a significant dampener on economic growth. The resulting Global Trade Tensions underscore the profound interconnectedness of our world, where actions taken by major economic powers reverberate across all markets, including the dynamic and often unpredictable realm of cryptocurrency. As investors, businesses, and consumers, staying vigilant and informed is paramount. While the immediate focus might be on traditional markets, the ripple effects will undoubtedly touch the crypto space, manifesting as increased volatility or shifts in investor sentiment. The ability to understand these macro-economic forces and adapt investment strategies accordingly will be crucial for navigating the challenging times ahead. The current situation serves as a powerful testament to the fact that no market exists in isolation, and the global economic health directly influences the trajectory of even the most innovative digital assets.

That’s why the merger between Synopsys and Ansys represents more than a significant milestone in Synopsys’ strategy to expand its reach beyond core chip design tools into broader engineering software. China approves $35B deal after U.S. policy reversal China’s top antitrust regulator has conditionally approved the $35B acquisition of Ansys by Synopsys. The approval by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) was confirmed on Monday, just days after the United States quietly relaxed recent export restrictions on chip design software. The merger between Synopsys and Ansys, two leading U.S. software companies, was first announced in January 2024 and had already received clearance from U.S. and European regulators. However, the SAMR paused its review in May after Washington imposed new restrictions that effectively barred U.S. chip design toolmakers like Synopsys from selling software to China. Synopsys’ CEO, Sassine Ghazi, had previously expressed optimism about closing the deal by the end of June. However, that timeline slipped due to SAMR’s pause. In early July, the U.S. government eased up parts of that restrictive policy as trade talks between the U.S. and China, which had been underway for months, reached an agreement in Geneva at the end of June. Companies involved in the negotiations confirmed that the policy changes were communicated earlier this month. According to people familiar with the matter, China’s commerce ministry urged the SAMR to resume the paused approval process shortly after the U.S. eased restrictions. The regulator responded swiftly, approving the deal on July 12, which was a single day after the process resumed. The SAMR’s conditions While China ultimately allowed the transaction, the SAMR imposed three main conditions to manage concerns regarding market concentration and ensure that Chinese companies are not unfairly disadvantaged after the merger. The companies are required to divest business lines where their offerings significantly overlap to mitigate the risk of monopolistic control in specific software markets. The SAMR also stipulated that Chinese customers must be allowed to renew their existing contracts under the same terms after the merger to save local businesses from sudden disruption or unfavorable renegotiations. Finally, the Chinese regulator mandated Synopsys to continue offering its EDA software to Chinese firms on fair and reasonable terms without bias in pricing or functionality. The regulator noted that Synopsys formally accepted these terms on July 11. Any failure to comply could result in penalties under China’s anti-monopoly law. Synopsys, headquartered in Silicon Valley, provides essential EDA tools and intellectual property used by top semiconductor companies like Nvidia and Intel to design and test their chips. Ansys, based in Pennsylvania, initially dealt with structural analysis software but has since become a major player in multiphysics simulation tools used in industries ranging from automotive and construction to healthcare and aerospace. Analysts say that the $35B deal reflects the growing intersection of semiconductor design and engineering workflows, due to the complexity of modern technologies like AI, electric vehicles, and industrial automation.

Recently, Bank of America (BoA), a global banking behemoth, released its insightful “On Chain” report, spotlighting Ethereum as a cornerstone in the burgeoning stablecoin sector. This isn’t just another report; it’s a powerful affirmation of blockchain technology’s increasing relevance and a clear signal of where institutional interest is heading. For anyone tracking the pulse of the crypto market , this development underscores the growing synergy between established finance and the decentralized frontier. Bank of America’s Bold Statement: Why It Matters for the Crypto Market When a venerable institution like Bank of America publishes a report specifically naming a cryptocurrency, it carries immense weight. Their “On Chain” report isn’t just a casual observation; it’s a meticulously researched document that delves into the mechanics and potential of digital assets. By highlighting Ethereum as a key player in the stablecoin market, BoA is effectively validating a significant segment of the digital economy. This recognition from a top-tier bank signals a maturing perspective on cryptocurrencies, moving beyond mere speculation to acknowledging their foundational role in future financial infrastructure. What does this mean for the broader crypto market ? Firstly, it lends credibility. For years, digital assets operated on the fringes, often dismissed by mainstream finance. Now, we’re seeing a shift where major banks are not only studying but actively acknowledging the utility and potential of blockchain networks. This can pave the way for: Increased Mainstream Acceptance: As more traditional institutions engage, the perception of crypto shifts from niche to legitimate. Regulatory Clarity: Bank interest often precedes regulatory frameworks. BoA’s report could encourage clearer guidelines, fostering a more secure environment for growth. Enhanced Investment Flows: Institutional validation can open doors for more conservative investors who previously shied away from the perceived volatility and uncertainty of the crypto space. This report is more than just an analysis; it’s a strategic indicator of the direction traditional finance is likely to take, viewing certain digital assets not as competitors but as integral components of a modernized financial ecosystem. Ethereum’s Unrivaled Dominance in the Stablecoin Sector The report emphasizes a critical statistic: over 50% of all stablecoins currently reside on the Ethereum network. This isn’t by chance; it’s a testament to Ethereum’s robust infrastructure, network effects, and pioneering role in smart contracts. But what makes Ethereum the preferred home for these dollar-pegged digital assets? Ethereum’s Core Strengths for Stablecoins: First-Mover Advantage & Network Effect: Ethereum was the first blockchain to offer a widely adopted smart contract platform, enabling the creation of tokens like ERC-20, which stablecoins utilize. This led to a powerful network effect, attracting developers, users, and liquidity. Security and Decentralization: As one of the most decentralized and battle-tested blockchains, Ethereum offers a high degree of security. This is paramount for stablecoins, which often represent significant value and require unwavering reliability. Vast Developer Ecosystem: Ethereum boasts the largest and most active developer community in the blockchain space. This ensures continuous innovation, maintenance, and the creation of tools and protocols that benefit stablecoin issuers. Interoperability with DeFi: The vast majority of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are built on Ethereum. Stablecoins are the lifeblood of DeFi, used for lending, borrowing, trading, and yield farming. This deep integration makes Ethereum the natural habitat for stablecoins seeking utility and liquidity. While challenges like high gas fees have historically plagued Ethereum, ongoing upgrades (like the transition to Proof-of-Stake and the development of Layer-2 scaling solutions such as Arbitrum and Optimism) are addressing these issues, further solidifying its position. The fact that the majority of stablecoin value is locked on Ethereum underscores its fundamental importance to the digital economy, making it a powerful force for stability and growth. What Drives Institutional Adoption of Stablecoins? The Bank of America report points to growing institutional adoption as a key driver for stablecoin expansion, which in turn benefits Ethereum . But why are traditional financial institutions, corporations, and large-scale investors increasingly looking at stablecoins? Key Drivers for Institutional Interest: Driver Explanation Efficiency & Speed Stablecoins enable near-instantaneous, 24/7 transfers of value globally, bypassing traditional banking hours and lengthy settlement times. This is crucial for cross-border payments and inter-company transfers. Reduced Costs Compared to traditional wire transfers or international payment systems, stablecoin transactions often incur significantly lower fees, especially for large volumes. Programmability Built on smart contract platforms like Ethereum, stablecoins can be programmed for specific uses, enabling automated payments, escrow services, and complex financial instruments without intermediaries. Access to DeFi Yields Institutions can deploy stablecoin holdings into DeFi protocols to earn yields that often surpass those available in traditional finance, creating new revenue streams. Hedging & Liquidity Stablecoins provide a stable, liquid on-ramp and off-ramp for crypto trading, allowing institutions to quickly move in and out of volatile assets without converting back to fiat. This growing interest from institutional players is a game-changer. Their participation brings not just capital but also a demand for robust infrastructure, regulatory clarity, and enterprise-grade solutions, all of which indirectly bolster the underlying networks like Ethereum that host these assets. The Future of Stablecoins: Navigating Regulatory Momentum The phrase “regulatory momentum” is a powerful one in the context of stablecoins. As Bank of America suggests, clear and consistent regulation is not a hindrance but a catalyst for widespread adoption. The current landscape for stablecoins is fragmented, with different jurisdictions proposing various approaches. However, a global push towards comprehensive frameworks is undeniable. Why Regulation is Crucial for Stablecoins and Ethereum: Consumer Protection: Regulations aim to protect users by ensuring stablecoins are adequately backed and transparently managed. Financial Stability: Governments and central banks want to ensure stablecoins don’t pose systemic risks to the broader financial system. Combating Illicit Activities: Clear rules help prevent stablecoins from being used for money laundering or terrorist financing. Fostering Innovation: Paradoxically, well-defined regulations can encourage innovation by providing certainty for businesses and developers. For Ethereum , the impact of regulatory clarity on stablecoins is profoundly positive. If stablecoins gain clear legal standing and operational guidelines, their utility and adoption will explode. This would translate directly into increased transaction volume, network usage, and fee generation for Ethereum, further solidifying its economic model and potentially increasing its value as stablecoin adoption expands, as analysts suggest. The U.S., EU, and other major economies are actively debating and implementing stablecoin legislation. The emergence of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) also plays into this narrative, as governments explore their own digital currency options, potentially coexisting with or influencing the trajectory of private stablecoins. Beyond Stablecoins: How This Impacts the Broader Ethereum Ecosystem While the Bank of America report specifically highlights Ethereum ‘s role in stablecoins, the implications extend far beyond this single use case. The increased usage and institutional interest driven by stablecoins have a ripple effect across the entire Ethereum ecosystem and the broader crypto market . Benefits for Ethereum’s Growth: Increased Network Revenue: More stablecoin transactions mean more gas fees paid to the network. With Ethereum’s EIP-1559 upgrade, a portion of these fees is burned, making ETH a deflationary asset over time. Enhanced Security: Higher network usage and value locked in stablecoins incentivize more validators to secure the Proof-of-Stake network, making it even more robust against attacks. Developer Magnet: A thriving ecosystem with clear institutional interest attracts more talented developers, leading to more innovative applications and services built on Ethereum. Value Accrual: As a foundational layer for such a significant part of the digital economy, Ethereum’s native asset, ETH, is positioned to accrue value from the growth of stablecoins and the broader DeFi landscape they underpin. Catalyst for Layer-2 Adoption: The demand for efficient stablecoin transfers on Ethereum pushes the adoption of Layer-2 scaling solutions, which will ultimately benefit the entire network’s scalability. The synergy is clear: the success of stablecoins on Ethereum directly contributes to the health and growth of the Ethereum network itself. This feedback loop creates a powerful positive cycle, cementing Ethereum’s status as a critical piece of the future financial infrastructure. Challenges and Opportunities Ahead Despite the optimistic outlook, challenges remain. Competition from other Layer-1 blockchains vying for stablecoin dominance, the ongoing need for scalable solutions, and the complexities of global regulatory harmonization are all factors that will shape the future. However, these challenges also present immense opportunities for innovation and collaboration within the crypto space. For individuals and institutions, understanding these dynamics is crucial. The insights from Bank of America provide a valuable lens through which to view the evolving digital asset landscape. It’s a testament to the fact that cryptocurrencies, particularly those with strong fundamentals and real-world utility like Ethereum, are increasingly becoming undeniable forces in global finance.

In a July 2 letter obtained by The Canadian Press , Chew asked to meet within two weeks, pointing out the order dates back to when a U.S. ban on the app seemed likely. He pointed out the directive followed a national security review conducted under the Investment Canada Act, which lets Ottawa examine any foreign investment that might threaten national security. “There is no upside to this outdated and counterproductive government order, which was issued under a different government and in a different era, and which doesn’t reflect today’s reality,” Chew wrote. When François‑Philippe Champagne was industry minister, he said the government acted to address “specific national security risks,” though he did not spell out what those risks were. Critics have pointed to Chinese laws that can force companies like ByteDance Ltd. to assist in intelligence gathering as the core concern. Tiktok challenges national security grounds Chew argued no evidence has ever been shown that TikTok poses a security threat to Canada, and he said officials have been unwilling to discuss possible fixes. He suggested steps such as stronger data‑security protocols, plus more transparency and outside oversight, could ease Ottawa’s worries. Last November, following a national security review of its parent company ByteDance Ltd., Ottawa ordered the Canadian subsidiary to be dismantled. Despite that, the app remains available to its 14 million Canadian users, but would no longer have any presence or representatives within Canada’s jurisdiction. Chew cautioned that enforcing the requirement would isolate Canada from its international partners, particularly those in the Five Eyes intelligence coalition, none of which have taken comparable measures. He added the decision appears rooted in “assumptions about TikTok’s future in the United States which no longer hold true.” The federal review began in late 2023 but remained confidential until March 2024, shortly after the U.S. House of Representatives approved legislation targeting TikTok unless ByteDance divested. In June, President Donald Trump again extended the U.S. deadline for banning the app for a third time. TikTok warns of major layoffs and investment cuts Chew warned that failure to intervene would force TikTok to lay off over 350 staff in Canada, halt direct investments here and scale back support for domestic creators and cultural initiatives. “The wind‑up process is rapidly approaching a critical juncture,” he wrote. He highlighted that TikTok’s Canadian staff have appeared before parliamentary committees, worked with regulators, trained law enforcement on lawful‑access requests and assisted Elections Canada during last year’s federal vote. “TikTok maintaining a presence in Canada means there is a local team who is accountable to Canadian policy‑makers and authorities,” he wrote. On July 7, the company said it would stop sponsoring major Canadian arts events like the Juno Awards and TIFF.A spokeswoman for the minister declined to comment on whether Joly has responded or intends to meet Chew. Separately, TikTok has filed a challenge in Federal Court against the shutdown directive, contending that Ottawa’s actions “bear no rational connection to the national security risks it identifies.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

48252595,https://cryptonews.com/?p=382090,1752535036,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/48252595.jpeg,"ChatGPT Predicts the Price of XRP, Pi Coin, and Dogecoin by the End of 2025",https://cryptonews.com/news/chatgpt-predicts-the-price-of-xrp-pi-coin-and-dogecoin-by-the-end-of-2025/,"OpenAI’s ChatGPT predicts that leading altcoins could establish new record highs in the second half of 2025, riding the momentum of Bitcoin’s explosive rally. Earlier today, Bitcoin rose to a new historic high watermark of $122,838, marking an all-time high with further gains appearing likely. If the momentum holds, global adoption could be just around the corner. This breakout has fuelled strong optimism among crypto enthusiasts, sparking speculation that an even more powerful bull market than the legendary 2021 run may be developing, with multiple top altcoins expected to achieve unprecedented valuations. Outlined below are several digital assets that OpenAI’s ChatGPT predicts hold substantial near-term growth prospects. XRP (Ripple): ChatGPT Predicts This Cross-Border Payments Leader to Double with Ease According to ChatGPT’s projections, Ripple’s XRP could climb to $20 by late 2025, which would equate to a nearly sevenfold increase from its current level around $2.99. This bullish scenario is driven by a combination of growing institutional usage, enhanced regulatory clarity, and mounting speculation about a potential XRP spot ETF that could unlock broader retail and institutional inflows. Additionally, XRP continues to gain recognition for allowing fast, affordable, and compliant international payments. In 2024, the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) commended XRP’s ability to facilitate immediate cross-border transfers without conventional intermediaries. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!! UN Endorses @Ripple and @StellarOrg as Cornerstones of New Global Payments Network! #XRP and #XLM will run the new financial system! pic.twitter.com/ufewexCKmR — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 13, 2024 A pivotal U.S. court decision in 2023 ruled that XRP’s retail transactions did not constitute securities, undermining longstanding SEC claims. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed in March that the protracted legal battle had concluded, removing a key overhang and bolstering market sentiment towards XRP and other altcoins. Looking ahead, the $3 resistance zone is viewed as a major barrier. If XRP can decisively break above its current level in the coming months, ChatGPT’s more conservative $10 target by year-end becomes highly plausible. However, reaching the more ambitious $20 price tag will depend on further regulatory advancements in the U.S. and stabilising political dynamics in regions such as the Middle East. Additionally, among major cryptocurrencies, XRP has been a standout performer, rallying 464% over the past year versus Bitcoin’s 100% rise. Pi Network ($PI): ChatGPT Predicts This Mobile Mining Project Could 10X by Year-End Pi Network has revolutionised the mining sector with its innovative “tap-to-mine” approach, allowing individuals to mine crypto directly from their smartphones without specialised hardware or technical expertise. From its current value near $0.4639, ChatGPT predicts that Pi Network could surge more than tenfold to hit $5 by the end of the year. Instead of resource-intensive mining, users earn PI tokens simply by opening the app and tapping daily – a mechanism that has proven especially attractive to newcomers in the crypto space. Launched in February 2025, $PI has exhibited significant volatility. In early May, it rocketed from $0.58 to $1.57 within just four days, a dramatic 171% gain driven by renewed institutional interest. Currently, PI’s RSI stands at 39 and is climbing, reflecting an underbought asset with strengthening bullish momentum as green candles sweep across the wider crypto market. If this trend continues, $PI may surpass its critical $3 resistance level this summer, setting a new record above February’s all-time high of $2.99. Thanks to its intuitive app and scalable Layer-1 blockchain, Pi Network is well-positioned to accelerate mass adoption, potentially reaching $5 even without a full-scale bull market, though broad user growth and regulatory approvals in the U.S. will be vital to achieving ChatGPT’s loftiest projections. Dogecoin ($DOGE): The Original Meme Coin Primed for a Major Comeback Finally, Dogecoin ($DOGE) , the first meme coin, maintains a robust market valuation of approximately $30.9 billion. Initially created in 2013 as a joke, it has since evolved into a legitimate crypto asset with widespread utility and a dedicated global community. Often moving in sync with Bitcoin, Dogecoin combines meme-driven volatility with surprising long-term resilience. Currently trading at $0.20 and showing little change over the past day, DOGE’s RSI is at 65 and trending upwards, suggesting accumulating buyer interest as Bitcoin continues its rally. Technical charts indicate a steep falling wedge pattern from November through April, signalling strong potential for a sharp upward breakout. ChatGPT predicts that DOGE could rise to $1.50 in a bullish market phase, representing a possible 7.5X return. On the adoption side, Dogecoin continues to receive strong corporate and celebrity endorsements. Tesla accepts DOGE for certain merchandise purchases, while platforms like Revolut and PayPal have integrated it into their payment offerings, strengthening its mainstream utility. TOKEN6900: Could This Emerging Meme Coin Deliver 1000x Returns? While ChatGPT remains bullish on established altcoins, their massive market caps often limit their explosive growth potential. For traders aiming for exponential gains, lesser-known meme coins might offer sharper upside. One such project is TOKEN6900 (T6900) , an ERC-20 meme token that launched its presale barely a week ago. Hey Siri, define aura pic.twitter.com/NVYT1pZmed — Token6900 (@Token_6900) July 8, 2025 TOKEN6900 has already secured around half a million dollars from early investors, reflecting strong market interest and the potential for a powerful launch rally. Unlike meme coins that attempt to pivot towards utility, TOKEN6900 embraces its identity as a purely hype-fueled asset, using irony, aggressive marketing, and FOMO to drive momentum. Its website boldly declares: “It’s Not Built On Fundamentals. It’s Built On Delusion, Irony, And The Collective Hallucination Of Terminally Online Traders.” Inspired by SPX6900, another meme token celebrating absurdist dot-com aesthetics, TOKEN6900 has a total supply of 930,993,091 tokens—exactly one more than SPX6900’s original supply, emphasising its competitive branding. This strategy appears to be resonating, as evidenced by its strong presale performance. While lacking inherent utility, holders can stake tokens for additional yield alongside speculative price gains. Interested participants can purchase T6900 via its official website at a current presale price of $0.006575. With prices set to increase within 24 hours, those aiming for the lowest possible entry point may wish to act promptly.

Simultaneously, numerous top-tier altcoins and the best meme coins —such as TRON, Sui Network, Solana, Pepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin—have recorded fresh highs in recent months, reinforcing the perspective that both sectors still hold substantial growth opportunities. As anticipation builds for the next major bull run, investors are zeroing in on select crypto assets that could potentially eclipse their prior all-time price highs. Ripple (XRP): Cross-Border Payments Crypto Arguably Price Performer of the Year Ripple’s XRP continues to strengthen its position as a key connector between traditional banking infrastructures and blockchain-based remittance networks. Its capability to allow near-instant global transactions at minimal fees has attracted notable institutional interest. The United Nations has even recognised XRP as a feasible solution for transferring funds internationally without reliance on traditional intermediaries. After enduring years of legal challenges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple secured a pivotal legal victory in 2023 when a court ruled that retail sales of XRP did not constitute securities transactions. The SEC officially dropped the case in 2025, ending the four-year litigation. This outcome solidified XRP’s standing within the industry, creating an important regulatory benchmark for the wider crypto market. Investor confidence surged following this development, driving XRP’s price up by over 464% within a year, outperforming Bitcoin’s 103% gain over the same period. XRP faces stiff resistance at its current level of around $3, but it’s likely to smash through this as arguably the biggest success story among the billion cap altcoins. Earlier this year, a bullish flag pattern formed across its support and resistance lines, suggesting the possibility of a surge towards $3.50 this summer, surpassing its previous peak of $3.40 set in January 2018. Pepe ($PEPE): Meme Coin Giant Targets Fresh Record Highs Pepe ($PEPE) has carved out its place among the top three meme coins, driven by the meme’s cultural popularity and strong market performance. Inspired by Matt Furie’s iconic cartoon frog, $PEPE has generated massive returns for early investors and now ranks among the top three meme tokens, with a market valuation exceeding $4.6 billion. pic.twitter.com/jR6ycgAYjc — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 9, 2025 Launched in April 2023, Pepe triggered a wave of copycat tokens, though none have managed to match its momentum or staying power. Its rise gained further traction when Elon Musk briefly adopted a Pepe-themed profile picture on X (formerly Twitter). Currently priced around $0.00001235, $PEPE has posted gains of 23% in the past week, although it is still approximately 56% below its all-time high of $0.00002803 set in late 2024, technical analysts observed a falling wedge pattern in Q1, a formation typically indicative of an incoming upward price breakout. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reached 65, indicating strengthening bullish momentum, suggesting limited further potential gains for $PEPE through the week as it is close to 70, which typically signals an over-priced asset, triggering a selloff. If macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions remain stable, Pepe may embark on another major rally before summer ends. Cardano ($ADA): Can This Eco-Friendly Crypto Set New Price Highs in 2025? Interest in Cardano ($ADA) is on the rise, bolstered by institutional backing and positive technical indicators. Like XRP and Solana, Cardano was named by Donald Trump as a possible reserve crypto asset for inclusion in a proposed U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Founded in 2014 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano is acclaimed for its research-driven development model and energy-efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus, which spurred Ethereum’s own transition from Proof-of-Work to PoS. With a market capitalisation of $27.4 billion, ADA would need to more than triple in value to surpass Solana and challenge Ethereum’s market dominance. In the last seven days, Cardano outperformed Bitcoin during the market-wide rally, adding 27% to its price while Bitcoin only grew 12%. Current projections suggest ADA could climb from its present price of $0.76 to nearly $2 by mid-year. More bullish forecasts anticipate a full recovery to its previous all-time high of $3.09, marking a rebound from its 75.5% drop since September 2021. Strong support levels and a bullish flag formation observed between November and April hint at continued upside potential, although ADA’s RSI has strayed into overbought territory at 72, which means traders will be doing a spot of profit-taking that could depreciate the price over the week. The next immediate level of resistance is at $1.15, but ADA enjoys strong support in the $0.85 to $0.90 range. Seeking the Next Explosive Altcoin?

The Spanish news agency EFE (via MSN ) reported that the Sumar group of MPs wants the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) to use the system for retail investors. The group says that the system would let users “clearly and visually” identify the type of asset they are purchasing. Sumar has sent a written proposal to the regulator. The group complained that a “significant portion” of tokens traded on crypto exchange platforms “lack material backing or any underlying value.” Spanish lending giant BBVA said it won approval to launch Bitcoin and Ether trading, integrating crypto into everyday banking. #BBVA #CryptoTrading https://t.co/ifB7FxuUV8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 10, 2025 Traffic Light Crypto Warnings Coming to Spain? The parliamentary group also wants to rename cryptoassets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) . It proposes using terms like “crypto bets” or “unbacked assets.” The lawmakers justified their request by explaining that coins “do not grant their owners any rights to tangible assets or have any connection to productive activities.” The traffic light warning system would see the CNMV apply one of three labels to each cryptoasset on an exchange or bank’s investing platform. The regulator would give a green light to cryptoassets that are registered, supported, and supervised. These coins would also need to demonstrate stable market performance. It would use yellow for cryptoassets that have “limited backing” or display moderate volatility. An orange light would identify “unsupervised” coins with high risk levels. And a final red label would be reserved for “speculative assets with no identified issuer or material backing.” Europe’s markets regulator criticized crypto oversight in Malta for falling short in several areas related to an unidentified entity it authorized https://t.co/BQrJYufB9B — Bloomberg (@business) July 10, 2025 Crypto Concentrates Wealth, Say Lawmakers Sumar said it is wary of “extreme forms of fictitious capital that do not generate value, but rather generate volatility, inequality, and wealth concentration.” Carlos Martín Urriza, the Sumar spokesperson for Economy and Finance, said policymakers should protect retail investors from assets that are not backed by a verified asset or collateral. Carlos Martín Urriza, the Sumar spokesperson for Economy and Finance. (Source: elDiarioes/YouTube) He added that crypto trading is often more similar to betting than to investing. Furthermore, Sumar wants the CNMV to force banks and exchanges to ensure their customers read pre-purchase information on cryptoassets before allowing them to buy coins. This should apply regardless of a token’s individual classification, Sumar said. It added that these mandatory warnings must be clearly summarized and contain visual elements. Sumar suggested that the CNMV use prominent warning systems. It said the regulator should base its models on those already used in sectors such as gambling or tobacco sales. Restrict Access to AI-powered Trading, MPs Urge Sumar lawmakers also want to create specific regulations for algorithmic trading pools. And the group wants to restrict retail investors’ access to trading platforms that use AI or algorithms.

One notable figure within the community, known as The5Blairs, recently presented a scenario in which the value of 10,000 XRP could grow to $33.8 million. This projection is based on a potential price increase to $3,380 per token. A Breakdown of the $33.8M Estimate At the time The5Blairs made this projection, XRP was valued at approximately $2.20. His analysis relied on the token’s transaction velocity and annual settlement volume. According to his findings, XRP facilitates around $1.3 trillion in yearly transaction value, with a circulating supply of about 60 billion coins and a transaction velocity of 10. He stated that with further expansion, especially through new partnerships and institutional adoption, XRP could potentially support between $100 trillion and $2 quadrillion in annual transactional volume. Based on that assumption, and using proportional valuation metrics, he estimated that XRP’s price would need to increase more than 1,500-fold from $2.20 to approximately $3,380 to handle that level of utility. Currently, XRP is trading around $2.98 , making 10,000 units worth roughly $29,800. Based on The5Blairs’ forecast, an investor holding this amount could see their investment grow dramatically if such projections are realized. Similarly, smaller holdings would still yield considerable returns, for example, 1,000 XRP could translate to $3.38 million, while 50,000 XRP might be valued at over $169 million in this scenario. Notably, Edoardo Farina , founder of Alpha Lions Academy, has consistently advocated for long-term holding, urging investors to maintain at least 10,000 XRP. He emphasizes the importance of patience, noting that the asset’s potential could reward disciplined holders significantly over time. Key Developments That May Influence XRP’s Growth Several factors underpin this price outlook. A significant one is Ripple’s extensive network of business relationships, many of which are formalized through non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). During Ripple’s legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it was revealed that the company had signed more than 1,700 NDAs since 2013 with a variety of banks, financial service providers, and technology firms. These partnerships suggest broader institutional interest that could translate into future adoption of the XRP Ledger. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another catalyst is Ripple’s growing involvement in the cross-border payments sector. In a statement from June 2025, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse noted that the XRP Ledger could eventually support up to 14% of SWIFT’s global transaction volume. Given that SWIFT processes an estimated $150 trillion annually, XRP could potentially account for $21 trillion in payment flow within the next five years if that target is achieved. In addition, The5Blairs emphasized the opportunity for XRP to play a role in the global derivatives and foreign exchange markets. With the notional value of global derivatives estimated at over $1 quadrillion, capturing even a small fraction could generate substantial demand for the token. Nonetheless, it remains uncertain how much of this market XRP can realistically absorb. Further reinforcing optimism around XRP is Ripple’s increasing presence in major financial infrastructure. Earlier in 2025, Ripple’s subsidiary, Hidden Road, became part of the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC)’s government securities netting platform. The DTCC processes over $2 quadrillion in transactions annually, and Ripple’s involvement through Hidden Road could indicate a gradual move toward integration. Recent DTCC patent applications mentioning Ripple and XRP have further fueled speculation, although no official announcements have been made regarding formal partnerships. While these projections are highly speculative and depend on several complex market variables, they reflect the growing confidence within the XRP community. Investors and analysts continue to monitor developments surrounding Ripple’s partnerships, market expansion, and potential use cases, all of which could significantly influence the token’s long-term value trajectory.

This comes despite all the buzz surrounding the technology. During a call with analysts on Monday, Lambert said stablecoins boast incredible technical potential — fast transactions, 24/7 uptime, low fees, programmability, and immutability. But those features alone don’t make them ready for everyday payments. He noted that people also need a frictionless user experience, broad accessibility, and consumer distribution. Mastercard eyes role as key infrastructure provider for stablecoin adoption Mastercard sees itself as the connective tissue between the world of crypto and traditional finance . Lambert emphasized that Mastercard can offer the kind of infrastructure — global acceptance, security protocols, and regulatory compliance — needed to help stablecoins scale and become useful at checkout. This vision isn’t new. Mastercard and rival Visa have been exploring stablecoin initiatives since at least 2021. Mastercard recently partnered with Paxos to support the minting and redemption of the USDG stablecoin. The company also backs stablecoins like FIUSD from Fiserv, PYUSD from PayPal, and USDC from Circle, signaling its long-term ambition to power the backend of stablecoin transactions. Consumer friction and low utility keep stablecoins from mainstream use Lambert notes that about 90% of stablecoin usage today is still tied to crypto trading, not consumer purchases. While companies like Coinbase and Shopify have made moves to enable stablecoin payments for everyday goods and services, significant barriers remain, particularly user adoption and checkout friction. Lambert highlighted that existing stablecoins do not presently offer a compelling use case for peer-to-merchant payments. He likened them to prepaid cards, with the ability for users to spend their wallet balance with some merchants, although the feature set is limited. Despite the common narrative being that stablecoins can be used to circumvent card networks and the transaction fees that are paid to process transactions, Mastercard and the rest are attempting to flip the script, presenting themselves as necessary allies who can help increase stablecoin utility by integrating them into established payment rails. Mastercard’s Chief Commercial Payments Officer Raj Seshadri added that stablecoins have hidden complexities. “You still need to convert to and from fiat. That adds costs — not just the price of the stablecoin itself, but also the FX, regulation, settlement, and ramping infrastructure.” Still others hold counter opinions. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller recently said that stablecoins will bolster competition in the payments system, and that was a positive direction. Speaking at an event at the Dallas Fed, Waller said that the rise of stablecoins will make many payments cheaper and faster. He noted, “And that’s the goal for me, as a free-market capitalist economist, is that I want competition in payments to drive down the cost for households, consumers, and businesses. That’s it.” With stablecoin regulation gaining traction in the US, banks and institutions increasingly weigh their role in this evolving space. Regulatory clarity is prompting some to explore offering stablecoins or deposit tokens to retain deposits that might otherwise flow into digital wallets. According to Lambert, every financial institution evaluates whether it needs to issue stablecoins and what the right product-market fit might be. For many, the focus is on avoiding a loss of control over customer deposits. Beyond the private sector, Lambert noted that governments and central banks are also taking a closer look at digital currencies, aiming to support innovation while preventing dollarization in their domestic economies. “We expect to see a wide range of approaches emerge globally,” he said. The crypto industry is moving closer to mainstream adoption as Congress advances a slate of pro-crypto bills this week. Dubbed “ crypto week ” by the Republican-led House, the legislative push includes a landmark bill to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, potentially heading to President Donald Trump’s desk for approval.

Here’s What It Means for Ripple,https://timestabloid.com/federal-reserve-implements-iso-20022-heres-what-it-means-for-ripple/,"The U.S. Federal Reserve has officially transitioned its FedWire Funds Service to the ISO 20022 messaging standard, a move that could significantly benefit Ripple, which has been ISO 20022-ready for years. Effective from today, July 14, 2025, all institutions using the FedWire Funds Service are now required to process transactions using ISO 20022 . This transition, originally scheduled for March 2025 but postponed to provide additional preparation time, marks a critical step in modernizing the U.S. financial system. ISO 20022 is a globally adopted framework for electronic data exchange between financial institutions. It provides standardized formats that support detailed and structured messaging. This not only enhances data clarity but also streamlines transaction processing, reduces errors, and strengthens regulatory compliance, especially for cross-border payments. By the end of 2025, projections suggest that over 80% of international financial flows will utilize ISO 20022. As adoption accelerates worldwide, it is quickly becoming the default protocol across the banking and payments industry. Ripple’s Early Adoption Gives It a Competitive Edge Ripple positioned itself early to capitalize on the global shift to ISO 20022. In 2020, it became the first blockchain company to join the ISO 20022 Standards Body. Since then, Ripple has aligned its infrastructure, particularly RippleNet, to meet the standard’s requirements. RippleNet supports structured financial messaging in accordance with ISO 20022, enabling seamless integration with traditional banks and financial entities that rely on the same format. This compliance enhances the platform’s speed, transparency, and interoperability, critical features for modern financial institutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Although XRP, Ripple’s native cryptocurrency, is not an ISO 20022 messaging token, it remains integral to RippleNet’s operations. XRP is primarily used in Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service, now known as Ripple Payments, which facilitates instant currency conversion and settlement, eliminating the need for pre-funded accounts. Implications for Ripple in the U.S. Market The Federal Reserve’s adoption of ISO 20022 could increase demand for payment infrastructure that already supports the standard. Ripple, having implemented ISO 20022-compliant messaging well in advance, is well-positioned to assist U.S. financial institutions through this transition. In addition to its technical readiness, Ripple is actively expanding its presence in the American financial landscape. The company recently applied for a U.S. banking license and a Federal Reserve master account for RLUSD, Ripple’s upcoming stablecoin. These developments suggest Ripple is working to deepen its involvement in the domestic banking sector. As more U.S. banks seek partners that can meet ISO 20022 standards, Ripple’s early adoption and proven infrastructure could prove advantageous, potentially driving greater adoption of its services across the regulated financial ecosystem.

Who’s Really Winning?",https://thecoinrise.com/while-subbd-builds-early-buzz-blockdag-secures-338m-expands-reach-with-seattle-sports-deals-whos-really-winning/,"The SUBBD presale has begun making the rounds, pulling in $750,000 and drawing early attention from altcoin fans. With a price still low enough to create buzz and growing talk around the next altcoin cycle, the setup is working in its favor. But while SUBBD builds early traction, another name has already captured the spotlight and a massive slice of the market. BlockDAG (BDAG) has passed $338 million in funds raised and locked partnerships with two professional Seattle sports franchises, taking a clear lead in visibility and execution. While SUBBD is still getting its footing, BlockDAG has already delivered measurable results and built out real-world connections. Early Days for SUBBD: Can the Hype Hold? SUBBD’s presale has reached $750,000, sparking growing interest among those watching for the next altcoin breakout. With a low entry price and strong community push, the project is starting to build traction. Market sentiment is leaning optimistic, and that’s helping more traders take notice of early-stage coins like SUBBD. The project claims it aims to simplify DeFi by offering a smoother interface, easier staking features, and a better user experience overall. These upgrades are part of what’s being promised in future rollouts, though most of the features are still in the development phase. As of now, much of the buzz is based on potential rather than working products. That hasn’t stopped chatter from picking up online. Social engagement is on the rise, and daily buy-ins are increasing, showing a steady uptick in early participation. Still, the project will need to follow through with real progress. For now, SUBBD is in the spotlight, but staying there will depend on execution, not just excitement. BlockDAG Delivers on Price and Partnerships! BlockDAG is pushing forward fast. The project has already raised $338 million, with 23.8 billion coins sold across multiple batches. It’s currently in Batch 29, where the regular price is $0.0276. However, as part of the GLOBAL LAUNCH release, buyers can still access a special price of $0.0016 until August 11. With the confirmed launch price set at $0.05, this gives users a chance to lock in a 3,025% return. Those who joined back in Batch 1 are already sitting on a 2,660% gain compared to the current launch rate. Beyond strong pricing and presale performance, BlockDAG is also scoring big on real-world exposure. The project has partnered with two professional Seattle sports teams, the Seattle Orcas and the Seattle Seawolves. These teams bring loyal fan bases and major league attention, helping BlockDAG reach audiences beyond just crypto circles. These aren’t shallow branding deals. They’re part of a broader push to build credibility, drive mass adoption, and make BlockDAG a household name in and outside of crypto. While many projects promise big things and stay in development mode, BlockDAG is already delivering results. From major sports partnerships to pricing momentum, it’s turning plans into action. The numbers, the strategy, and the visibility all show that BlockDAG is already ahead of the curve, and still climbing. Two Coins, Two Different Paths SUBBD is still in the early stages, and its low entry price is helping it gain attention. Early optimism is there, and the project could ride future market momentum. But hype alone won’t carry it forever. The gap between early buzz and long-term success is often bigger than expected. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is already making big moves. It has raised $338 million, sold 23.8 billion coins, and built partnerships with two major teams. This isn’t just about talking a good game, it’s real action, real numbers, and a growing base of support. Where SUBBD is working to build its name, BlockDAG has already carved out a spot. While both projects are on the map, only one has real traction right now. In this space, timing counts. But results matter even more, and BlockDAG has both. The Bottom Line SUBBD is seeing early success, and the price is drawing in attention. If the overall market stays positive, more people could jump into the presale. Still, it’s a wait-and-see situation, as the project’s promises are yet to be proven. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is all about delivery. With $338 million raised and 23.8 billion coins already sold, the project has momentum, and now, major partnerships with the Seattle Orcas and Seawolves to back it up. The GLOBAL LAUNCH release price of $0.0016, valid until August 11, makes it even more appealing. At launch, the $0.05 price locks in a 3,025% return. SUBBD is still trying to build its case. BlockDAG is already making its mark.

Currently, technical indicators, surging liquidity, and macroeconomic tailwinds have analysts predicting that the leading cryptocurrency is on the verge of a parabolic surge to a $140,000 top in the next few weeks. $140,000 Set As Bitcoin Next Top Target The Bitcoin price is exhibiting remarkable strength as it continues its parabolic advance beyond the $123,000 range. Technical indicators identified by crypto analyst Mr. Wall Street are now aligning around a new short-term target between $135,000 and $140,000. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices Are Surging Today According to the market expert’s chart report, BTC has successfully broken out of a Broadening Wedge pattern after consolidating between a descending support and horizontal resistance for nearly two months. The decisive breakout above the $112,000 resistance validates the analyst’s earlier bullish projections. Initially, the analyst proposed two possible scenarios: A breakout above all-time highs around $112,000 leading directly to a $117,000-$120,000 rally or a brief dip to $92,000 to fill the CME gap before continuing up toward the same target zone. Based on its recent price movement, Bitcoin has chosen to follow the first scenario, underscoring the strength of its bullish momentum and signaling that short-term Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) has had little to no effect. With the second scenario officially invalidated, BTC’s price trajectory is seemingly clearer and higher. The recent surge above $123,000 has also spotlighted the next major liquidity pool between $135,000 and $140,000. The chart highlights that reaching this zone would liquidate over $45 billion in short positions. Following this, the next target zone sits between $160,000 and $170,000, threatening another $70 billion in short liquidations. M2 Surge And MACD Fuel BTC’s Bullish Case Mr. Wall Street’s bullish setup for Bitcoin is further supported by macroeconomic and key chart indicators. The analyst pointed to US President Donald Trump’s recent approval of a bill to raise the country’s debt ceiling—a move that signals accelerating debt growth. This, in turn, is expected to expand M2 money supply, which historically correlates with rising prices for assets like Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Repeat Parabolic Phase From 2017 And 2021? Here’s The Target BTC’s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also remains fully intact across all time frames, while the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio is still well below historic top levels. In addition, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has yet to enter overbought territory. These indicators confirm that Bitcoin is still far from a macro top, making the $135,000 – $140,000 range a plausible interim target. Looking ahead, Mr. Wall Street emphasizes that Bitcoin has entered a supercycle, a phase where the market is marked by price discovery. While he acknowledges the possibility of a short-term retest of the $112,000 level before continuing upward, the analyst maintains that, regardless of minor pullbacks, the price action from here is likely to be swift and aggressive.

According to the NY Times sources, senior team members, including Meta’s freshly appointed chief AI officer, 28‑year‑old Alexandr Wang met last week to debate pausing the release of their most advanced publicly available model, Behemoth. The focus was instead on developing a proprietary version. Meta used to make its AI code public so other developers could build on it. A closed‑source model keeps the code private, but Meta argues that sharing openly speeds up progress and gives more people access to powerful tools. Switching to a private model would be a big change for Meta, which developers have praised for its open‑source approach. As recently as last year, Yann LeCun, one of Meta’s top AI researchers, asserted that “the platform that will win will be the open one.” Earlier this year, the Chinese venture DeepSeek leveraged Meta’s public code to create its own sophisticated AI chatbot, underscoring the tangible value of openness. Although Meta finished training Behemoth on extensive datasets aimed at maximizing its capabilities, sources report that the rollout was postponed after initial in‑house evaluations fell short of projected benchmarks. Following the inauguration of its superintelligence division last month, the Behemoth project considered a “frontier” effort at the leading edge of AI development, was put on hold pending further review. These talks are still early with no decisions made, and any change would need CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s approval. Meta could keep its public models while also building a private one. Either way, moving toward a private model would be a big strategic shift as it tries to keep upwith rivals like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic. In a podcast interview last year, Zuckerberg said, “We’re obviously very pro open source, but I haven’t committed to releasing every single thing that we do.” Meta’s new lab is under scrutiny after several AI missteps Meta has dealt with management problems, seen key staff depart, and launched products that didn’t catch on. Zuckerberg still wants to build an AI that achieves superintelligence, something some describe as beyond human thinking. To staff the initiative, Zuckerberg initiated an aggressive recruitment campaign, offering nine‑figure compensation proposals to lure leading researchers from OpenAI, Google, Apple, Anthropic, and others. Moreover, he reassigned the executive formerly in charge of Meta’s generative AI division. In June, Meta poured $14.3 billion into Scale AI, the company founded and helmed by Alexandr Wang. The deal granted Meta a 49 % equity share, and Wang, together with some of his key associates, transitioned into senior posts within Meta. Following the investment, Meta rebranded its AI arm as “Meta Superintelligence Labs,” with Wang stepping into the role of chief AI officer. He now leads an elite cohort of about a dozen recent hires, several Scale AI deputies, and Nat Friedman, ex‑CEO of GitHub. Sources indicate that numerous members of Wang’s group gathered at Meta’s Menlo Park headquarters for their inaugural in‑person meeting last week. They occupy a secluded office suite adjacent to Zuckerberg’s workspace. On Tuesday, Wang held a Q&A with about 2,000 AI team members. He said his core team’s work would stay private and that everyone in the AI division would now focus on building superintelligence. Looking forward, some AI employees anticipate that the upcoming vesting window in August, which will allow certain staff to liquidate company shares. It could trigger a wave of departures among those not selected for the superintelligence group. On Monday, Zuckerberg unveiled intentions to commit hundreds of billions of dollars toward AI compute infrastructure, aiming to have Meta’s inaugural supercluster operational by next year. In a Facebook update , Zuckerberg stated, “Meta Superintelligence Labs will have industry‑leading levels of compute and by far the greatest compute per researcher. I’m looking forward to working with the top researchers to advance the frontier!” He called the first supercluster “Prometheus” and disclosed plans for additional multi‑gigawatt installations, such as “Hyperion,” projected to reach five gigawatts over the next few years. Zuckerberg’s moves show he’s frustrated with how slowly Meta’s AI is progressing. After the underweheling response to Llama 4 in April, he is taking a different road to better compete with OpenAI and Google. “For our superintelligence effort, I’m focused on building the most elite and talent‑dense team in the industry,” he added, marking the start of a new phase in Meta’s AI endeavors.

Huang talked to CNN’s Fareed Zarkaria about AI as a positive force . He called it “the greatest technology equalizer the world has ever seen.” As Nvidia’s CEO noted in his paper, there will always be jobs, but AI is expected to alter working practices across every industry and profession. He said everyone else’s job would be 50% less than normal, but that didn’t mean there would be no jobs left for people. Work would change, not vanish, he argued. He said it is one example of how AI enables people who are (or aren’t) computer literate to become more productive. Huang mentioned the number of new users to ChatGPT, saying that even on their first try, they saw value in it. According to him, AI is just about the empowerment of people. On the other hand, Huang underscored that AI is a tool, not a weapon. Its filing times have gone from those built on specialized knowledge to becoming something AI should be able to handle in load times. He says the AI trend is not about devaluing human workers but valuing them more. AI will reshape the workforce with more opportunities Though the Nvidia CEO acknowledged that some jobs could be automated out of existence, he emphasized the potential for new opportunities. Huang said AI is not here to replace humans, but rather “to augment human capabilities.” He foresees new jobs in AI, from training models and engineering prompts to curating data, managing humans, and ensuring AI ethics. This is consistent with earlier shifts during the industrial and digital revolutions, when technology replaced some jobs but created many new industries and jobs. He added that AI was a “co-pilot,” rather than a competitor. Automation of repeatable and boring work can free humans from focusing on creative, strategic, and people work. He said this will improve health, education, financial, and agricultural systems. More crucially, Huang stresses the need for societies to retrain and educate workers to make this transition. People need to be educated to cohabitate and work with the AI, and riding the back of this dragon is the secret to a world and economy that spins ever upward. Nvidia challenges apocalyptic AI predictions Huang’s view contrasts with some of the more dystopian notes of the AI industry. In May, Dario Amodei, the CEO of the $61.5 billion artificial intelligence startup Anthropic, told Axios that AI might be able to strip half of all entry-level white-collar jobs from the global economy within the next five years. He warned that unemployment figures could climb double if the switch isn’t handled well, rebounding from 10% to 20%. In just a year, AI systems could write all the code a business requires, Amodei said. Some, such as Adam Dorr, an employee of the Wells research house RethinkX, believe that AI and robotics could automate away virtually all human labor by 2045. The transition will be difficult, Dorr told The Guardian, and there isn’t much time to get ready for the shift AI will herald. But Huang is still not caving to panic. He believes such doomsday scenarios fail to consider the possibility of AI as a force for good for humanity. “The effect of AI is not so much replacement but transformation,” said Huang. The AI revolution is being driven in no small part by Nvidia, which Huang heads. The company’s chips power some of the world’s most advanced AI models, such as the ones underpinning ChatGPT and other large language models. But Huang insists that such technology should empower, not replace, humans. As the world grapples with adapting its workforce for the era of silicon and artificial intelligence, Nvidia’s CEO offers a clear message: Don’t fear AI—use it to redefine the future of work.

This follows a week of strong gains, with BTC rising by more than 10% amid a broader uptrend in the cryptocurrency market. Despite the minor pullback, market analysts are closely monitoring on-chain and derivatives data to assess whether momentum is building toward a more aggressive phase of the rally. The recent surge has also benefited the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, lifting total global crypto market capitalization to just under $4 trillion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Records: What Miners and Leverage Traders Are Doing Behind the Scenes While Bitcoin continues to dominate in terms of volume and influence, sentiment metrics suggest that traders and investors may still be approaching with measured optimism. According to analysts, several indicators are now pointing to a potential shift in market dynamics that could influence Bitcoin’s next major move. Market Euphoria Not Yet Confirmed CryptoQuant contributor Joao Wedson has offered insights into the current structure of the Bitcoin market through an analysis of the price gap between spot and perpetual futures contracts on Binance. In a recent QuickTake post, Wedson noted that the spot price of Bitcoin continues to outpace the perpetual futures price, a sign that market sentiment has not yet tipped into full euphoria. Historically, a positive gap between the two markets has signaled increased speculative activity and the onset of parabolic rallies. “The gap is still in negative territory,” Wedson stated, “but the narrowing trend indicates that sentiment may be transitioning from cautious to more optimistic.” The analysis implies that traders in the futures market have yet to aggressively price in further upside, possibly waiting for stronger confirmation before deploying leverage. Should this gap flip to positive territory, it could be interpreted as a sign of increased risk appetite, potentially fueling a sharper upward move. Wedson also emphasized the importance of monitoring how derivatives markets respond in the coming days. “If the trend continues and flips positive, we could see a more intense phase of the rally driven by leveraged traders,” he wrote. Until then, the current environment appears to reflect a market in the process of building a foundation, rather than one that has already entered a euphoric phase. Bitcoin Profit-Taking Remains Measured In another analysis, CryptoQuant’s Enigma Trader examined the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), a key indicator used to evaluate the extent of realized profits by Bitcoin holders. According to the post, SOPR levels have remained moderately above 1 as BTC hit new highs, suggesting that some profit-taking is occurring, but not at a rate that disrupts the broader trend. The analyst observed that a spike in SOPR around July 3–4 coincided with short-term holders taking profits.

Republicans introduced a trio of bills to reshape digital asset policy, only to face sharp pushback from Democrats accusing them of favoring corporate interests over everyday Americans. The proposed legislation , comprising the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, was introduced in the House of Representatives to address data privacy compliance and future digital currency systems. GOP lawmakers argue the bills are crucial to maintaining the US’s competitive edge in financial innovation. However, during a heated Rules Committee hearing on Monday, Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern denounced the initiative as a “crypto giveaway,” slamming it as a misguided effort that ignores the risks of crypto-related corruption. “I have not had one person in my district come up to me and say, ‘please, please Jim, make it easier for crypto millionaires to get richer, please make it easier to con people,’” said McGovern. “Yet that is exactly what is going on here.” The remarks were a direct jab at President Donald Trump’s increased activity in the crypto space, including his family-linked company World Liberty Financial and its associated stablecoin USD1 (and his meme coin, Official Trump). GOP defends innovation push In a rebuttal, Republicans said the bill is meant to future-proof the economy and maintain US competitiveness in a fast-evolving cryptospace. The GOP’s tactics were also a central focus when committee chairman Rep. Virginia Foxx gaveled in the session. Foxx described the GENIUS Act as historic legislation, stating that it would help drive responsible innovation in the United States. She added that Republicans look forward to working with businesses nationwide to fulfill the Act’s promise. The GENIUS Act aims to oversee stablecoins by establishing comprehensive federal standards for issuers. The CLARITY Act addresses deficiencies in digital asset market structure, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act seeks to prohibit a US Central Bank Digital Currency that the government would use, many Republicans fear to surveil private financial activity. Republicans argue that over-regulation should not stymie innovation and financial freedom. They say the bills will advance transparency, offer legal surety, and guard against harm to consumers while also helping to spur growth in the digital economy. Critics, however, argue that the legislation doesn’t do enough to tackle fraud and abuse. McGovern said the bills opened doors to hucksters and market manipulation and were tilted toward rich insiders rather than average investors. Lawmakers struggle to build bipartisan support Republicans face an uphill task despite their enthusiasm. With a narrow majority in the House and no Senate control, the GOP may rely on Democrats to progress the legislation in both chambers. Democrats are not budging easily. Those conflicts of interest, tied to Trump and spread across government, alarmed Representative Maxine Waters and Senator Adam Schiff. Schiff cautioned of “ dangerous entanglements ” between crypto firms and elected officials. Waters noted that many components of the bill aligned with the goals of Trump’s crypto-backed ventures. She emphasized that the American people deserved policies that protected their money, not schemes designed to enrich political allies. Some Democrats also said the legislation diverted the House from urgent matters, like preventing national security threats and addressing economic inequality. And even as crypto comes under greater scrutiny for fraud and instability, most recently in the unraveling of FTX and ongoing enforcement actions by the SEC, some lawmakers are raising questions about whether it’s time to ease up on oversight. The discussion on Monday turned temporarily to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, dramatizing the extent to which the legislative calendar has become infused with tension and pressure. However, Republicans say they are committed to revisiting the crypto package before the August recess, which means they have just under two weeks to do so.

This slowdown may push authorities to introduce new measures to keep growth on track. To date, the globe’s second‑largest economy has avoided a big downturn, supported by a tentative trade agreement with Washington and the buffer of current policy measures. However, the sentiment among investors has turned cautious for the latter half of the year. This is marked by slow exports, persistent price declines and subdued consumer confidence. Forecasts suggest Tuesday’s release at 2 am GMT will reveal 5.1% annual growth in Q2, down from 5.4% in Q1, according to the latest Reuters consensus. “While growth has been resilient year‑to‑date, we still expect it to soften in the second half of the year, due to the payback of front‑loaded exports, ongoing negative deflationary feedback loop, and the impact of tariffs on direct exports to the U.S. and the global trade cycle,”said analysts at Morgan Stanley. They added that “The third‑quarter growth could slow to 4.5 percent or lower, while Q4 faces unfavourable base effect, putting the annual growth target at risk.” Beijing may announce more spending Morgan Stanley anticipates that Beijing may roll out an extra fiscal package ranging from 500 billion to 1 trillion yuan starting towards the end of Q3. June customs figures indicated a rebound in inbound shipments and a modest uptick in exports, driven by a rush to beat an early‑August tariff ceasefire deadline with the United States. Other June metrics on factory activity and consumer spending are forecast to decelerate further. Quarter‑on‑quarter, the Reuters survey predicts GDP will have risen by 0.9% in Q2, after a 1.2% gain in Q1. Furthermore, analysts expect growth to moderate to roughly 4.6% in 2025, falling short of official ambitions, and slip to around 4.2% in 2026. Investors are turning their attention to the late‑July Politburo session, anticipating cues on future policy moves and potential new economic support. According to the survey, experts foresee a 10‑basis‑point reduction in the People’s Bank of China seven‑day reverse repo rate, and a comparable decrease to the loan prime rate, sometime in Q4. Job market makes output cuts risky So far this year, authorities have stepped up public works funding and expanded household subsidy programs, while the central bank in May trimmed borrowing costs and pumped cash into markets to offset trade‑related headwinds. However, experts warn these measures might not be enough to stop the ongoing price drops. June’s producer price index plunged at a rate unseen in roughly two years, underlining persistent deflationary trends. Observers expect officials to step up cuts to excess factory production and look for new ways to encourage domestic spending. Analysts say it’s tricky to cut excess output without triggering major layoffs in a weakening job market. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Surprisingly, while Ethereum continues to dominate headlines, a growing number of savvy investors are shifting focus toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising star in the decentralized lending space that’s quietly gaining traction. The project is priced at $0.03 in the 5th presale phase, which is more than 70% sold. Those who invest in this phase will get a 100% return on investment after listing the token. More than $12.3 million has already been raised, with a total of more than 13,200 early investors. During presale Phase 6, the token will cost $0.035, and that represents 16.67% return on investments made in Phase 5. This could signal a broader shift in investor priorities beyond traditional blue-chip tokens. Ethereum Eyes Fresh Breakout Amid ETF Inflows and Upgrades The good news is that Ethereum (ETH) has recovered its position below the $3,000 level, trading about $2,948 and swinging in between $2,934 and $3,028, having achieved a 6-8 percent upsurge driven by the huge flows of ETFs and tokenization. Individual products at BlackRock, such as the company ETHA trust attracted an all-time high of $300 million in a single day, which adds to a combined $700+ million of flows into ETFs weekly as institutional players show renewed confidence in the DeFi and staking environment at Ethereum. The smart money is still around, but people are gaining more interest in some new DeFi projects, like Mutuum Finance. Presale Milestone: Mutuum Finance Hits $12.3 Million The Mutuum Finance presale has more than 13200 investors and has raised more than $12.3 million. Investors have picked up more than 70% of the tokens in phase 5. This indicates growing confidence of investors in the short-term success of the project as well as in their bright future. Mutuum Finance Launches Massive Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering $100,000 giveaway , divided into 10 winners of 10,000 MUTM tokens. In addition, the top 50 holders of the Mutuum Finance will be rewarded under its newly introduced leaderboard system. As the users level up they will be rewarded the bonus tokens. Transforming DeFi Lending: The Mutuum Finance Approach Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is transforming DeFi lending through the creation of a platform that renders customers the sole owner of their assets. It is a workable multifunctional double-lending system, which incorporates the synergy of both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. In P2C, lending pools are utilized via smart contracts. The platform is sensitive to prevailing market conditions in real time, an aspect that makes returns to lenders less volatile and borrowers financially stable. Through the elimination of intermediaries, the P2P model provides direct lending, which is particularly convenient on highly volatile assets like other coins. Over $12.3 million raised, 13,200+ early investors, and 70% of Phase 5 tokens already gone, Mutuum Finance is clearly gaining momentum as smart money rotates into high-upside DeFi plays. While Ethereum targets a modest move toward $4,000, early MUTM buyers are eyeing a 100% ROI at launch and an even greater upside as uncollateralized lending and dual lending architecture reshape the DeFi narrative. Phase 6 will push the price to $0.035, locking in a 16.67% return for Phase 5 investors. Add in a $100,000 giveaway and a leaderboard rewards system, and the case for Mutuum becomes even stronger.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As bitcoin (BTC) trades near $119,500, having just recently broken through another all-time high of $120,000 , digital asset investment products are also breaking records for inflows – but there's a regional disparity. According to CoinShares, U.S.-listed funds dominated with $3.74 billion in inflows, while Germany saw $85.7 million in outflows, underscoring a growing divergence in global institutional sentiment. This robust institutional appetite in the U.S. is exemplified by Vanguard’s evolving stance on crypto investments. Despite once branding bitcoin as an ""immature asset class,"" the $10 trillion asset manager is now Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy (MSTR)'s largest shareholder, indirectly becoming the most significant Bitcoin holder in traditional finance, as Presto Research recently noted in a d aily markets update. Meanwhile, QCP Capital highlights in a recent note that institutional enthusiasm remains notably robust, exemplified by over $2 billion net inflows into spot BTC ETFs last week. Yet, derivatives markets suggest a more nuanced approach. Leveraged long positions are expanding aggressively, with perpetual funding rates approaching an elevated 30% and open interest surpassing $43 billion, levels unseen since BTC reclaimed $100k in January. Such aggressive positioning raises caution flags, recalling February's abrupt $2 billion liquidation event. “Froth is building,” QCP warns. BTC Continues to Outpace Luxury Watches Bitcoin (BTC) is up 27.87% year-to-date and 13.22% in the past month, easily outperforming the luxury watch market’s modest +4.5% rebound in Q2, according to a recent report co-authored by Morgan Stanley and WatchCharts. Gains were concentrated in flagship models, Daytona, Nautilus, Royal Oak, while brands like Panerai, Breitling, and IWC underperformed. Inventory for watches under $5,000 remains historically elevated, and dealer turnover in that range continues to lag. “Price recovery remains narrow and concentrated,” the report notes, driven by “renewed interest from high-end collectors and improved global risk appetite.” Both BTC and watches, it adds, tend to benefit from “expansionary monetary environments and periods of wealth creation.” But the speculative capital isn’t flowing evenly. Bitcoin has attracted more of the macro-driven bid, with institutional inflows and 24/7 liquidity making it the preferred high-beta asset. The pandemic-era correlation between BTC and watches, both beneficiaries of easy money and speculative excess, broke down in late 2023 with the approval of U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs. BTC has since matured into a macro-sensitive, institutionally backed asset, while watches have returned to their roots: fashion. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin briefly approached $123,000 before cooling off, while crypto-related stocks held modest gains and analysts said the market remains far from euphoric, with one projecting BTC’s $2.5 trillion market cap could eventually converge with gold’s $22 trillion. ETH: ETH surged past $3,079 in early trading on strong volume before retreating in the afternoon to settle near $3,011, forming a textbook breakout-pullback pattern with support holding above the key $3,000 level. Gold: Gold slipped 0.1% after hitting a three-week high amid renewed tariff threats from President Trump and focus on trade talks and U.S. data, while silver surged to its highest level since September 2011. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets opened mixed Tuesday, with investors brushing off President Trump’s tariff shifts and turning attention to upcoming Chinese economic data, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 remained flat. S&P 500: RBC Capital Markets raised its 2025 S&P 500 target to 6,250 from 5,730, but unlike Goldman and BofA, it expects little upside from current levels, with the index already above 6,280 as of July 11.

According to on-chain data from Artemis and deBridge, more than $125 million worth of assets have been bridged into Solana from other blockchains in the last seven days. REPORT: In the last 7 days, over $125 million bridged from other chains to @Solana , including $70 million+ from Ethereum alone. (A growth of nearly 40% compared to last week) pic.twitter.com/jMVTiJZ8jr — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) July 14, 2025 Ethereum Fuels $70M Liquidity Wave Into Solana as Meme Coin Hype Cools Solana is experiencing a major liquidity revival, driven primarily by Ethereum, as the volume of bridged assets surges. According to data from Artemis, Ethereum accounted for over $70 million in inflows into Solana, representing nearly 56% of the total. Arbitrum followed with $14.1 million, while Polygon and BNB Chain contributed $7.5 million and $2.6 million, respectively. Other smaller chains made up the remaining $4.2 million. The total bridged volume into Solana rose by almost 40% week-over-week, with the Ethereum-to-Solana route emerging as the most dominant pipeline. Data from deBridge further confirms that $31 million in assets flowed from Ethereum to Solana alone. Source: solscan Much of this capital shift appears linked to a cooling off in the once-explosive meme coin launching frenzy. While Solana had previously seen a massive surge in new token launches, last week saw only 322,000 new token launches, a sharp slowdown compared to earlier peaks. This trend indicates a move back toward established projects and tokens. Interestingly, even during the heated rivalry between LetsBONK and Pump.fun, token activity remained relatively muted. LetsBONK graduated 1,243 tokens, double Pump.fun’s 622, and also launched 130,605 new tokens, significantly ahead of Pump.fun’s 77,250. Amid a slowdown in new meme coin launches, several older and more established Solana-based meme tokens are seeing renewed interest. Traders appear to be redirecting liquidity toward more recognizable assets, including Pepe ( PEPE ), Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Bonk ( BONK ), and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) , signaling a shift from novelty to familiarity. Source: Cryptonews PEPE has recorded a notable 23.73% increase in market capitalization over the past seven days and is now trading at $0.00001217. The token’s 24-hour trading volume stands at $5.87 billion, up 78.50% from the previous day. This surge in volume reflects a spike in market activity. As of today, PEPE’s market capitalization is $5.12 billion. Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), the second-largest meme token by market value, is also gaining traction. The token is currently trading at $0.00001329, up 14.9% over the past week and 0.6% in the last 24 hours. SHIB’s market capitalization is now $7.83 billion, ranking it 23rd in token market cap. Dogecoin ( DOGE ), the largest meme coin by market cap, is currently trading at $0.1982. It has risen 18.5% over the past seven days, reaching over $8.06 billion in market cap. Bonk ( BONK ) has captured significant market attention, with its price climbing 70% over the last 10 trading sessions. The token is currently priced at $0.00002719, reflecting a 6.27% increase in the past 24 hours. BONK’s market cap has climbed to $1.465 billion after gaining 33.9% in the past week. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) has also experienced a sharp resurgence. The token jumped 48.2% in the last seven days, lifting its market capitalization to $1.918 billion. The sudden momentum was amplified by a surprise social media endorsement from TRON founder Justin Sun, further fueling investor interest. Together, these developments point to a broader trend of capital rotation back into familiar meme coins, as traders seek stability and momentum within the increasingly saturated meme token market. Solana Tops Q2 Revenue at $271M, Outpaces Ethereum, Bitcoin & Tron Meanwhile, Solana itself continues to outshine its peers in core metrics. The blockchain generated over $271 million in revenue in Q2 2025, outpacing Ethereum, Tron, and Bitcoin for the third consecutive quarter, according to Blockworks.

Active addresses rose to 24.4 million, and fee revenue increased 44% to $7.68 million. Adding to the momentum is the anticipation around Solana ETFs. Polymarket data shows that traders now estimate a 99% chance that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot Solana ETF by the end of 2025. Bloomberg ETF analysts have sharply raised expectations for US approval of spot funds tracking Solana, Litecoin, and XRP. #ETFs #XRP https://t.co/dKK2ZIbW8c — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 1, 2025 Several major firms, including VanEck, Grayscale, 21Shares, and Bitwise, have already filed applications, signaling deep institutional interest. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart echoed the sentiment, saying , “We’re expecting a wave of new ETFs in the second half of the year. Solana is clearly leading that conversation.” Notably, Solana ( SOL ) is currently trading at $162.19, up 9.5% over the past 7 days. The token has also seen a sharp rise in trading activity, with 24-hour volume hitting $14.4 billion, a 133.4% increase from the previous day. Source: Cryptonews On July 12, analyst Ali Martinez shared a bullish outlook on Solana, highlighting a cup-and-handle pattern forming on the weekly chart, a classic bullish signal that often precedes major rallies. This is a critical level for Solana $SOL . A weekly close above $170 could ignite the next major bull run and open the gates to $2,000! pic.twitter.com/JjTaRdUL4h — Ali (@ali_charts) July 12, 2025 The pattern suggests that Solana has recovered from its past lows near $9.88, following a multi-year climb from its previous peak around $250. The recent price action appears to be forming the “handle” portion of the structure. Martinez points to $170 as a critical resistance level. A confirmed breakout above this level, particularly with a weekly close, could validate the pattern and trigger a strong upward move. Based on Fibonacci projections, potential price targets include $295 (a retest of the all-time high), with longer-term targets of $787, $1,314, and even $2,744. However, failure to break past $170 may lead to a pullback toward $135 or even $100, which has historically acted as strong support.

Overall retail sales rose 3.1% compared with a year ago, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said. The upturn was largely the result of warmer weather, which had prompted Britons to spend more on electric fans, sports, and leisure equipment. The bright weather also moved consumers out of doors, increasing spending on seasonal goods . The BRC’s Chief Executive, Helen Dickinson, said that food and non-food performances were good. “Retail sales heated up in June, with both food and non-food performing well,” she said. “Food sales remained strong, though this was partly driven by food inflation, which has risen steadily over the year.” Food sales alone rose 4.1% while non-food purchases rose 2.2%, overturning the retail sector’s drag on gross domestic product in May. Economic uncertainty and increased cost of living have made consumers tighten their belts this month. Businesses regain confidence The increase in retail spending is the latest in a series of indicators that point to the possibility that the UK economy is recovering after a weak spring. The economy shrank in April and May, the first consecutive contraction in economywide activity since 2009, as the country reeled from a combination of domestic and international forces, ranging from newly imposed tariffs by the United States to a hike in corporate taxes, and a national minimum wage that was raised that prompted businesses to pare back hiring and payroll costs. But the climate for business is improving. A purchasing managers’ index (PMI) published earlier this month indicated that private sector activity expanded quickly by nine months in June. That is for all of manufacturing and services. At the same time, a recent Bank of England survey showed that companies are ready to start taking on new staff again, which is good news for employment and consumer spending in the future. The survey found that companies planned to add to payrolls in the next 12 months by 1.1%, a sharp rebound compared to how cautiously the nation’s businesses began the year. Research fellow Paul Dales said in a note to investors that there was evidence to suggest the worst of the economic downturn had passed and that conditions were likely to improve. He added that although the recovery remained tentative, recent data indicated that confidence was returning in key sectors of the economy. Starmer leverages retail bounce for political relief The brighter economic horizon could not have come at a better time for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has been under pressure to produce results soon after assuming office . His administration has its hands full: from cost-of-living complaints to low productivity and slow growth. The recovery in retail sales, rising business confidence, and better labor market expectations offer a respite. It could give his administration the political room it requires to launch new reforms and investment plans without overshadowing a worsening recession. However, caution still abounds; amid ongoing global uncertainty, rising food prices, and potential interest rate changes from the Bank of England, economists said the trend indicates the UK could miss a prolonged recession. For Starmer, it may represent a narrow window of opportunity to cement public backing and stabilize the economy. Should these green shoots continue to flourish during the remainder of the summer and into the autumn, the UK could end 2025 with a stronger base for its economy than many dared to believe possible earlier this year.

According to data from sources, Coinbase’s stock ended up 1.8% at $394.01 per share on the day. At the same time, shares hit a peak of $398.50. At today’s closing price, Coinbase has a market cap of nearly $100.36 billion, the highest market cap the crypto exchange has recorded in history. Bitwise CIO anticipates Coinbase becoming a trillion-dollar company at some point Coinbase shares have popped 50% in the past month alone in conjunction with the highly successful initial public offering (IPO) of Circle Internet Group and favorable regulatory changes in the United States. The crypto exchange also encountered a significant achievement on May 19 after adding it to the S&P 500 index. This milestone distinguishes Coinbase as the first cryptocurrency-focused company to gain entry into this benchmark, highlighting its growing legitimacy within the financial sector. This month, Coinbase experienced a steady increase in revenue that did not come from transactions in the last year, totaling $772 million in the first three months, according to analysis from sources. Last week, the company brought on a user named AlexOnchain to help increase its social media presence. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan had previously forecasted Coinbase’s significant milestone. Based on his anticipation, the firm could eventually become a trillion-dollar company. On May 13, in an X Post , Hougan advised investors to choose a company currently worth less than $100 billion but has the best chance of reaching a value of over $1 trillion . He gave Coinbase as an example, which is valued at $61 billion. Coinbase’s stock rebounds amid growing adoption of cryptocurrencies On June 26, Coinbase’s shares had also experienced a surge, closing at a record high in a rally that increased the embrace of cryptocurrencies on Wall Street and Washington. This came after the stock of the crypto exchange operator jumped 5.5% to $375.07. That surpasses the previous peak of $357.39 in November 2021, only a few months after the company became public with a direct listing. Notably, Coinbase shares have soared more than 1,000% from a record low in late 2022, when the failure of FTX had cast further doubt on the digital asset’s future. The stock’s rebound came as cryptocurrency prices recovered, and the industry itself secured powerful new allies, including President Trump, a strong crypto supporter who has embraced crypto stances in the US. Another important milestone that contributed to the crypto exchange’s share surge was after the US Senate approved legislation for stablecoins pegged to the dollar, which are considered a promising payment method. Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer highlighted the significance of stablecoins in the company’s operations. According to him, revenues generated from stablecoins will probably enable the company to reduce its dependence on trading revenue, which is under pressure from competition. Following trade analysis, Coinbase’s main source of revenue has emerged from stablecoins. Therefore, with these new regulations, the crypto exchange will achieve financial stability and continuous success. Republican House leaders are preparing to pass a stablecoin regulatory bill this week, aiming to send Congress’s first major piece of digital asset legislation to the president’s desk. The vote marks the beginning of what supporters are calling “Crypto Week” — a series of decisions that could reshape the crypto landscape in the US. The proposed legislation, backed by industry leaders, is expected to bolster the adoption of dollar-based stablecoins. If passed, it would represent a significant win for crypto proponents, who collectively invested hundreds of millions of dollars during the last election cycle to help install lawmakers favorable to digital asset innovation, according to Federal Election Commission data. “The golden age of digital assets is here,” said Rep. Bryan Steil (R-WI), a key industry ally and chair of the House crypto subcommittee. President Donald Trump, now prioritizing digital asset regulation in his second term, has vowed to make the United States the “crypto capital” of the world. His family’s involvement in crypto ventures — which has reportedly earned them hundreds of millions of dollars — has drawn criticism from Democrats, some of whom have pushed, unsuccessfully, to include prohibitions targeting Trump-affiliated crypto businesses in the legislation. The House is also set to vote this week on two additional industry-supported bills: one to establish comprehensive market structure rules for cryptocurrencies, and another to block the Federal Reserve from launching a digital currency.

Crypto Capital Inflows Are Currently Sitting At $51 Billion As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, there is a stark difference in capital participation between the current Bitcoin rally and the one from December 2024. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $118,000—But Liquidity Still Thin, Glassnode Warns Below is the chart shared by the analyst that compares the two bull runs. The graph captures the 30-day capital flows occurring for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the stablecoins. For the former two assets, it tracks them using the Realized Cap indicator. The Realized Cap is a capitalization model that calculates a given cryptocurrency’s total value by assuming that each coin in the circulating supply has its value equal to the last time it changed hands on the network. In short, what the metric represents is the amount of capital that investors of the asset as a whole have put into it. Changes in this indicator, therefore, correspond to the entry or exit of capital into the network. As is visible in the chart, the 30-day Realized Cap change for Bitcoin and Ethereum (colored in orange) has gone up alongside the latest price rally, indicating that capital has flowed into these coins. It’s also apparent that stablecoin flows (blue) have also noted an uptick, although the scale has been smaller. For stables, capital flow can be directly measured using the market cap, since their price is always pegged to $1 means that the Realized Cap never differs from the market cap. In the cryptocurrency sector, capital mainly comes in through three entry points: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins. The altcoins usually only receive a rotation of capital from these assets. Since the flows related to the three have recently been positive, the market as a whole has been getting an injection of capital. In total, the aggregate capital inflows for the cryptocurrency sector have stood at $51.2 billion for the past month. This is certainly a sizeable figure on its own, but it pales in comparison to what was witnessed before. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Breaks 8-Year Resistance Line That Failed In 2017-2021 As Martinez has highlighted in the chart, the monthly capital flows peaked at almost $135 billion in the December 2024 Bitcoin rally above $100,000, more than double the latest number. Something to keep in mind, however, is the fact that the previous run was more explosive, while the latest one has come in two waves: an initial recovery surge above $100,000 that led into a consolidation phase and the current breakout into the $120,000 levels. This could, at least in part, explain why the metric has appeared relatively cool recently. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $121,700, up nearly 3% over the last 24 hours.

Dolce & Gabbana USA Was Not Behind Failed NFT Project According to a July 11 ruling from Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald of the Southern District of New York, Dolce & Gabbana USA Inc. is cleared from the high-profile litigation as it is not an “alter ego” of its parent company, Dolce & Gabbana SRL, which was in charge of the NFT-focused “DGFamily” project. “The Court finds that plaintiff has not adequately alleged that D&G S.R.L. completely dominated D&G USA even if D&G S.R.L. allegedly shared some employees and office space with D&G USA,” the filing states in part. “For the foregoing reasons, D&G USA’s motion is granted,” Reice concludes. DGFamily NFT Project Slammed As Rug Pull In Lawsuit Filed in May and amended in September 2024 , the lawsuit alleges that Dolce & Gabbana US and its Italian counterpart abandoned the “DGFamily” NFT project and failed to deliver on the mission’s promises while retaining customer funds. According to the Dolce & Gabbana website, “DGFamily” supposedly provided access to exclusive drops and collaborations, digital wearables, physical products, and events hosted by the company. However, the litigation implies that the iconic fashion house’s digital asset venture was nothing more than a classic “rug pull.” 1/ Dolce&Gabbana and @UNXD_NFT announce the highly anticipated launch of the DGFamily community. 3 distinct Boxes + digital, physical, & experiential benefits that take holders on a journey between real life & the metaverse. https://t.co/JMmmWZuRPu https://t.co/sCWuIQSwnD pic.twitter.com/r5t0M3FfBs — Dolce & Gabbana (@dolcegabbana) February 21, 2022 “Each of Defendants’ misrepresentations and omissions were material because they were designed to, and did, entice the public into purchasing unregistered securities (DGFamily Products) which were barely more than a vehicle for the Defendants’ enrichment,” the lawsuit reads. “Either through reckless incompetence or greed, Defendants failed to deliver what they promised in exchange for purchasing their digital assets and abandoned their crypto project while retaining over $25 million used to fund the project,” it continues.

33767162,[object Object],1752548440,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,XRP News: SBI CEO Reveals The Key To Massive Wealth Shift,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-as-massive-wealth-shift/,"The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of SBI Global Asset Management, Tomoya Asakura, has described XRP as more than just a speculative cryptocurrency , calling it a key player in a major global wealth transfer. As traditional markets feel the strain and pressure of rising tariffs and economic uncertainty, XRP is gaining momentum as a leading digital asset, seeing continued growth in both value and adoption. XRP Emerges As Global Wealth Transfer Trigger In a bold and defining statement, Asakura declared on the X social media that XRP represents the most significant wealth transfer opportunity of this generation. The CEO’s assertion places XRP at the epicenter of a rapidly changing financial world, one where traditional markets are faltering and digital currencies are rising in response. In his view, XRP stands apart from other digital assets due to its real-world use cases and growing role in global finance. He stated that the current economic climate, shaped by mounting tariffs and geopolitical tensions , is pushing investors away from traditional assets like stocks and bonds. In response, interest and capital are rapidly shifting toward alternatives such as cryptocurrencies and gold . Among these cryptocurrencies, XRP has surged significantly, with its market capitalization recently exceeding 25 trillion yen ($172.6 billion)— a development Asakura believes signals a deeper financial shift. He further emphasized that XRP’s strength lies in its fast and low-cost international remittance infrastructure . Unlike speculative tokens, the SBI asset management CEO reveals that XRP is backed by a real-world solution aimed at improving cross-border payment inefficiencies . He noted that Ripple, a crypto company holding the largest share of XRP‘s supply, has built a global payment network increasingly embraced by major banks and financial institutions. This ever-growing institutional adoption is a key reason why XRP is gaining long-term value and attention. According to Asakura, XRP is no longer a niche digital currency but a foundational component of the digital financial revolution set to redefine the rules of global wealth. He believes its value and potential may continue to grow as more institutions recognize its capabilities in cross-border payments and digital liquidity. XRP’s Value Continues Bullish Ascent XRP is on a steady bullish trajectory , as its price once again approaches the $3 mark. A new analysis by market expert Shawn Mark on X suggests that XRP is rapidly building momentum around a key resistance zone near the $2.90 level. The cryptocurrency recently surged to $2.92, marking a sharp upward move from around $2.00 just weeks ago. Mark’s chart analysis shows a breakout from a long-term descending wedge , indicating the potential for a trend reversal and the start of a new bullish phase. The chart also shows that the price is presently testing the 0.786 Fibonacci resistance level. If XRP manages to break through this area cleanly, the analyst predicts that it could retest its all-time high of above $3.40 from previous cycles. Should bulls maintain control, the cryptocurrency may then enter price discovery mode.",XRP|Descending Wedge Formation|Fibonacci Resistance level|ripple|ripple news|SBI Global Asset Management|Shawn Mark|Tomoya Asakura|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-07-15 03:00:40

In a statement on its website, the California‑based maker of AI hardware stated that it has already applied to the US Commerce Department for the needed licenses to continue H20 shipments. Management expects approval “soon,” and said deliveries to Chinese buyers will follow quickly once the paperwork is complete. Alongside the resumption plan, Nvidia introduced an RTX Pro graphics processor that it calls “fully compliant” with current regulations. The chip is aimed at digital‑twin artificial‑intelligence work in smart factories, logistics hubs, and other industrial settings inside China. Chief Executive Jensen Huang has been trying to keep doors open in both Washington and Beijing. The company noted that Huang recently met Trump and several lawmakers in the capital before traveling to China for talks with officials there. The meetings, Nvidia said, were meant to promote cooperation on AI research and to underline the firm’s open‑source support. Hints of a scaled‑down H20 for China first surfaced in May. Nvidia had been preparing a scaled-down version to satisfy US export curbs on advanced semiconductors and chips. Those curbs had blocked the original H20 from being shipped to Beijing.. Nvidia had previously lost access to $50 billion China market During Nvidia’s last earnings call, Huang painted a bleak picture of the impact of US curbs on its shipments. “The fifty‑billion‑dollar China market is effectively closed to U.S. industry,” he told analysts. “As a result, we are taking a multibillion‑dollar writeoff on inventory that cannot be sold or repurposed.” The pressure intensified in April. According to Nvidia, the government informed the firm that even the H20 chip’s export would be limited. The decision halted sales at once, leaving no time for the company to clear back orders. U.S. officials pointed to concerns over national security over highly capable AI chips reaching a major geopolitical rival. Nvidia had created the H20 in response to earlier restrictions imposed in 2022 under President Joe Biden. That initial round barred the export of the company’s fastest AI accelerators to China. The H20 is a scaled-down design meant to stay within the allowed performance ceiling. Huang is not worried about China’s military using US tech The CEO returned to the theme in a recent CNN interview that aired Sunday, shortly before another planned trip to China. Huang sought to ease fears that Nvidia hardware might boost Chinese military projects. Huang mentioned that the US need not be concerned about the People’s Liberation Army using US tech because “they simply can’t rely on it.” He added that Washington could cut off access whenever it wants and pointed out that China already has enough computing power. Huang added, “They don’t need Nvidia’s chips, certainly, or American tech stacks in order to build their military.” His remarks come after years of measures in the Congress and the White House to curb shipments of advanced AI chips to Chinese customers. Huang again criticized that strategy, calling it counterproductive to America’s goal of maintaining leadership in cutting‑edge tech. “We want the American tech stack to be the global standard,” he told CNN. “In order for us to do that, we have to be in search of all the AI developers in the world.” He noted that about half of those developers are based in China.
