In his latest video update, the analyst identified ADA’s recent technical breakout as a clear sign of bullish momentum, forecasting a price target of $1.90 in the coming weeks if momentum holds. Cardano Bull Run Is Back On Investing Broz began the segment by reiterating the broader context: Bitcoin’s explosive rally above the $120,000 mark has reignited speculation around the arrival of altseason. “This is just one more egg in the basket of potentially altcoin season coming very soon,” he noted, citing Bitcoin dominance breaking below a critical support level and altcoins “going berserk.” Related Reading: Cardano Price Explodes 30% In Past Week — Analyst Calls $5 Next Market Top Among the altcoins leading the charge, Cardano stood out. The analyst confirmed that he purchased ADA in the past 24 hours, identifying the move as more than just opportunistic. The trigger? A confirmed breakout above a long-standing resistance level that ADA hadn’t pierced since March 1. “This is a major win for Cardano holders who are trading it,” he said, explaining that a falling wedge pattern had been developing for weeks and now signaled a shift in trend. Investing Broz’s trading group had initially positioned long at $0.54, with a modest target of $0.80. But as he emphasized, “Cardano is not just breaking above the smaller resistance level—we’re breaking above a resistance level we haven’t been back above since March.” That March breakout, he reminded viewers, was spurred by a now-infamous Donald Trump tweet listing altcoins deemed suitable for a proposed American crypto reserve. While that spike proved short-lived, the current breakout is, in his view, fundamentally and technically sound. To calculate a realistic upside scenario, he applied the traditional breakout target technique by measuring the height of the formation and projecting it forward. “This would give you a Cardano price prediction of $1.90,” he stated, while also noting that such a target might be ambitious for a summer timeframe. Still, “it’s absolutely doable and definitely something you guys should be keeping an eye on.” Related Reading: The Last Time This Happened Cardano Rose 55%, ADA Analyst Makes Bold The analyst reinforced his bullish outlook using confirmation from the LuxAlgo indicator suite, which flashed a weekly buy signal—featuring a green reversal, bullish momentum, and positive money flow. Based on this, he offered a more immediate price range between $1.00 and $1.80. “I don’t think we’re going to stop at $1.80, but I think it’s a target to keep an eye on if you’re looking for a trade,” he said. Beyond that, a golden pocket Fibonacci extension points to a key level of $2.42 by year’s end. However, Investing Broz was quick to clarify that these are not his full-cycle targets for ADA. “This is not my long-term bullish price prediction for this bull market,” he emphasized. “This is simply tradable movements that I still think can happen over the next couple of weeks.” His earlier predictions suggested ADA could hit $7 to $10 by the cycle top—possibly extending into 2026 or even 2027. Throughout the segment, he stressed the importance of knowing when to take profit. “Every bull market has volatility. Cardano… is going to have volatile movements where they rally and then pull back,” he advised. For short-term traders, targets around $1.80 to $2.40 may present ideal levels to secure gains or even explore short positions if momentum wanes. While ADA is not the only altcoin the analyst is tracking—Ono and HAR were also highlighted for similar breakout behavior—Cardano’s confluence of technical strength, historical resistance flip, and volume surge make it a standout in the current environment. As the analyst concluded, “There’s still time… this is a major breakout, and if you’re a trader, this is what you wait for.” Cardano, for now, has flashed its signal. Whether it makes good on the $1.90 target may depend not only on its own momentum, but on the broader timing of altseason’s long-awaited arrival. At press time, ADA stood at $0.7447.

When major economic blocs clash, the reverberations are felt across all asset classes, including the volatile crypto market. Recently, whispers of a brewing US Trade War have turned into a loud declaration, with the European Union signaling its readiness to unleash a massive wave of EU Tariffs . This isn’t just about goods and services; it’s about investor sentiment, market stability, and ultimately, the future trajectory of your digital assets. Understanding the Looming Threat of EU Tariffs The European Union, through its seasoned European Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security, Maroš Šefčovič, has made a stern announcement: a staggering 72 billion euros ($84 billion) in additional EU Tariffs are on the table. This isn’t a speculative threat but a calculated response to potential actions from the United States. The EU’s stance is clear: if trade talks with the U.S. falter, these tariffs will be imposed on U.S. imports. This substantial figure underscores the seriousness with which the EU views the escalating trade dispute, highlighting their commitment to protecting their economic interests. These potential tariffs are not merely punitive; they are a strategic measure designed to create leverage and deter aggressive trade policies from the other side. Historically, tariffs have been a double-edged sword. While intended to protect domestic industries, they often lead to higher consumer prices, reduced trade volumes, and retaliatory measures from trading partners. The EU’s proposed tariffs would target a wide range of American goods, potentially impacting various sectors from agriculture to technology. The specific products targeted are often chosen for their political or economic sensitivity, aiming to maximize pressure on the opposing nation. The Spark: The US Trade War and Its Origins To fully grasp the current situation, it’s essential to look back at the catalyst. The specter of a US Trade War was first raised prominently when then-U.S. President Donald Trump announced his intention to impose a hefty 30% tariff on EU imports, effective August 1. This move was part of a broader ‘America First’ economic policy, which prioritized domestic production and aimed to reduce trade deficits by making imported goods more expensive. Trump’s administration had previously imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from various countries, including EU members, and had threatened tariffs on automobiles, among other sectors. This aggressive posture ignited a series of tit-for-tat exchanges, where one nation’s tariff imposition was met with a similar measure from the other. The underlying philosophy behind such actions is often to force renegotiation of trade agreements deemed unfair. However, the practical outcome frequently involves increased costs for businesses and consumers, supply chain disruptions, and heightened uncertainty in global markets. The threat of a 30% tariff from the U.S. on EU imports was particularly alarming due to its significant percentage and broad potential impact across European industries. Key Aspects of the Initial US Tariff Threat: Targeted Goods: While not explicitly detailed in the initial announcement, such tariffs typically target a wide array of goods, from industrial machinery to consumer products, impacting various sectors within the EU. High Percentage: A 30% tariff is substantial, making U.S. goods significantly more expensive for European consumers and businesses, potentially reducing demand. Unilateral Action: The announcement reflected a unilateral approach to trade policy, often bypassing traditional multilateral trade dispute resolution mechanisms. Economic Nationalism: It underscored a broader shift towards economic nationalism, where domestic industries are prioritized, even at the expense of international trade relations. The Mechanism of Retaliatory Tariffs: A Dangerous Cycle The EU’s preparation of 72 billion euros in additional duties is a classic example of Retaliatory Tariffs . These are duties imposed by a country on imported goods from another country in response to the latter imposing tariffs on its exports. It’s essentially an economic tit-for-tat, designed to exert pressure and signal a strong response to perceived unfair trade practices. The goal is to make the initial aggressor reconsider their stance, but it often leads to an escalating cycle that can harm both economies involved. When one major economic power imposes tariffs, the affected party has several options: accept the tariffs, challenge them through international bodies like the World Trade Organization (WTO), or impose their own retaliatory tariffs. The EU’s decision to prepare such a significant package indicates their preference for the latter, aiming to match the U.S. in economic leverage. The selection of goods for these Retaliatory Tariffs is strategic, often targeting products from politically sensitive regions or industries within the aggressor nation, aiming to maximize political pressure. Potential Impacts of Retaliatory Tariffs: Stakeholder Potential Impact Consumers Higher prices for imported goods, reduced variety. Businesses (Importers/Exporters) Increased costs, reduced competitiveness, disrupted supply chains, potential job losses. Governments Increased revenue from tariffs (initially), but potential for reduced overall economic growth and political friction. Global Economy Slower trade growth, increased uncertainty, potential for recession. Why Do Global Trade Tensions Matter to Everyone? Beyond the immediate financial implications for businesses involved in import and export, rising Global Trade Tensions have far-reaching consequences that affect every individual, even those not directly involved in international trade. These tensions create an environment of uncertainty, which is kryptonite for economic growth and investor confidence. When major economies are at odds, it disrupts established supply chains, leading to higher production costs and, ultimately, increased prices for consumers. This phenomenon, known as inflation, erodes purchasing power and can lead to a general slowdown in economic activity. Moreover, persistent trade disputes can strain diplomatic relations, making it harder for nations to cooperate on other critical global issues like climate change, cybersecurity, or public health crises. The interconnectedness of the modern world means that a trade dispute between two major players like the EU and the U.S. can send shockwaves across continents, affecting emerging markets, commodity prices, and even the stability of financial systems. It’s not just about tariffs; it’s about trust, stability, and the fundamental rules governing international commerce. Consider the ripple effect: a company reliant on imported components faces higher costs due to tariffs. To maintain profit margins, they might pass these costs onto consumers, or they might seek alternative, potentially lower-quality, suppliers. This can lead to a decline in product quality or an increase in prices for end-users. Similarly, exporters facing retaliatory tariffs find their products more expensive and less competitive in foreign markets, potentially leading to reduced sales and job cuts. This web of consequences illustrates why Global Trade Tensions are a concern for policymakers, businesses, and citizens alike. Analyzing the Broad Economic Impact on Markets, Including Crypto The potential Economic Impact of an escalating trade war between the EU and the U.S. cannot be overstated. In traditional financial markets, such tensions typically lead to increased volatility, with investors seeking safe-haven assets like gold or certain government bonds. Equity markets often react negatively to news of tariffs, as they signal reduced corporate profits and economic uncertainty. Currency markets can also experience significant fluctuations as traders anticipate changes in trade balances and capital flows. For the cryptocurrency market, the implications are multifaceted. While often seen as a hedge against traditional financial instability, crypto assets are not immune to macro-economic shocks. In times of heightened global uncertainty, Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies can exhibit dual behaviors: Risk-Off Asset: Sometimes, Bitcoin acts as a ‘digital gold,’ with investors flocking to it during periods of geopolitical or economic instability, viewing it as a decentralized alternative to traditional safe havens. Risk-On Asset: At other times, especially during sharp market downturns, crypto can behave like a ‘risk-on’ asset, falling in tandem with equities as investors liquidate assets across the board to cover losses or move to cash. An escalating trade war would likely lead to a general risk-off sentiment across global markets. This could initially put downward pressure on cryptocurrencies as investors reduce exposure to all perceived ‘risky’ assets. However, if the traditional financial system shows signs of deeper distress, the narrative of crypto as a decentralized alternative could gain traction, potentially leading to a resurgence in demand. The key is increased volatility and unpredictability, making informed decision-making crucial for crypto investors. Potential Economic Impact Scenarios: Reduced Global Growth: Tariffs act as taxes, increasing costs and reducing demand, which can lead to a slowdown in global economic expansion. Inflationary Pressures: Higher import costs are often passed on to consumers, leading to rising prices for goods and services. Supply Chain Disruptions: Businesses may struggle to source components or sell products across borders, forcing costly reconfigurations. Investor Uncertainty: Ambiguity surrounding trade policies makes investors hesitant, leading to reduced investment and market volatility. Currency Fluctuations: Trade imbalances can lead to significant shifts in currency values, impacting international trade and investment. Navigating the Storm: Challenges and Actionable Insights The prospect of a full-blown trade war presents significant challenges for businesses, consumers, and investors alike. The primary challenge is the unpredictability of outcomes. Trade disputes can escalate rapidly, or they can be resolved through last-minute negotiations. This uncertainty makes long-term planning difficult. For businesses, it means rethinking supply chains, sourcing strategies, and market entry points. For consumers, it could mean higher prices and fewer choices. For investors, it necessitates a careful re-evaluation of portfolio risk. Key Challenges: Uncertainty: The fluid nature of trade negotiations makes it hard to predict the duration and intensity of disputes. Supply Chain Fragility: Globalized supply chains are vulnerable to disruptions from tariffs, leading to delays and increased costs. Market Volatility: Financial markets, including crypto, will likely experience heightened swings in response to trade news. Erosion of Trust: Trade disputes can damage international cooperation and trust, impacting future collaborations. Actionable Insights for Investors: While the broader geopolitical landscape is beyond individual control, investors can adopt strategies to mitigate risks and potentially capitalize on opportunities: Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider a mix of traditional assets and cryptocurrencies. Within crypto, diversify across different asset classes (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, DeFi tokens). Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on geopolitical developments and trade talks. Understanding the macro environment is crucial for making informed investment decisions. Follow reputable news sources and economic analyses. Risk Management: Implement strict risk management strategies. This includes setting stop-loss orders, avoiding over-leveraging, and only investing what you can afford to lose. Look for Resilience: In crypto, consider projects with strong fundamentals, real-world utility, and robust development teams that might be more resilient to market downturns driven by external factors. Stablecoins, for instance, can offer a temporary refuge during periods of high volatility. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility is inevitable, maintaining a long-term perspective can help weather the storm. Focus on the underlying technology and adoption trends of cryptocurrencies. A Compelling Summary: The Interconnectedness of Our World The EU’s readiness to impose 72 billion euros in Retaliatory Tariffs against the U.S. is a stark reminder of the delicate balance in global trade relations. What begins as a dispute over specific goods can quickly escalate into a full-blown US Trade War , casting a long shadow over the entire global economy. These EU Tariffs are not just numbers on a balance sheet; they represent potential disruptions to supply chains, increased costs for consumers, and a significant dampener on economic growth. The resulting Global Trade Tensions underscore the profound interconnectedness of our world, where actions taken by major economic powers reverberate across all markets, including the dynamic and often unpredictable realm of cryptocurrency. As investors, businesses, and consumers, staying vigilant and informed is paramount. While the immediate focus might be on traditional markets, the ripple effects will undoubtedly touch the crypto space, manifesting as increased volatility or shifts in investor sentiment. The ability to understand these macro-economic forces and adapt investment strategies accordingly will be crucial for navigating the challenging times ahead. The current situation serves as a powerful testament to the fact that no market exists in isolation, and the global economic health directly influences the trajectory of even the most innovative digital assets.

That’s why the merger between Synopsys and Ansys represents more than a significant milestone in Synopsys’ strategy to expand its reach beyond core chip design tools into broader engineering software. China approves $35B deal after U.S. policy reversal China’s top antitrust regulator has conditionally approved the $35B acquisition of Ansys by Synopsys. The approval by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) was confirmed on Monday, just days after the United States quietly relaxed recent export restrictions on chip design software. The merger between Synopsys and Ansys, two leading U.S. software companies, was first announced in January 2024 and had already received clearance from U.S. and European regulators. However, the SAMR paused its review in May after Washington imposed new restrictions that effectively barred U.S. chip design toolmakers like Synopsys from selling software to China. Synopsys’ CEO, Sassine Ghazi, had previously expressed optimism about closing the deal by the end of June. However, that timeline slipped due to SAMR’s pause. In early July, the U.S. government eased up parts of that restrictive policy as trade talks between the U.S. and China, which had been underway for months, reached an agreement in Geneva at the end of June. Companies involved in the negotiations confirmed that the policy changes were communicated earlier this month. According to people familiar with the matter, China’s commerce ministry urged the SAMR to resume the paused approval process shortly after the U.S. eased restrictions. The regulator responded swiftly, approving the deal on July 12, which was a single day after the process resumed. The SAMR’s conditions While China ultimately allowed the transaction, the SAMR imposed three main conditions to manage concerns regarding market concentration and ensure that Chinese companies are not unfairly disadvantaged after the merger. The companies are required to divest business lines where their offerings significantly overlap to mitigate the risk of monopolistic control in specific software markets. The SAMR also stipulated that Chinese customers must be allowed to renew their existing contracts under the same terms after the merger to save local businesses from sudden disruption or unfavorable renegotiations. Finally, the Chinese regulator mandated Synopsys to continue offering its EDA software to Chinese firms on fair and reasonable terms without bias in pricing or functionality. The regulator noted that Synopsys formally accepted these terms on July 11. Any failure to comply could result in penalties under China’s anti-monopoly law. Synopsys, headquartered in Silicon Valley, provides essential EDA tools and intellectual property used by top semiconductor companies like Nvidia and Intel to design and test their chips. Ansys, based in Pennsylvania, initially dealt with structural analysis software but has since become a major player in multiphysics simulation tools used in industries ranging from automotive and construction to healthcare and aerospace. Analysts say that the $35B deal reflects the growing intersection of semiconductor design and engineering workflows, due to the complexity of modern technologies like AI, electric vehicles, and industrial automation.

Recently, Bank of America (BoA), a global banking behemoth, released its insightful “On Chain” report, spotlighting Ethereum as a cornerstone in the burgeoning stablecoin sector. This isn’t just another report; it’s a powerful affirmation of blockchain technology’s increasing relevance and a clear signal of where institutional interest is heading. For anyone tracking the pulse of the crypto market , this development underscores the growing synergy between established finance and the decentralized frontier. Bank of America’s Bold Statement: Why It Matters for the Crypto Market When a venerable institution like Bank of America publishes a report specifically naming a cryptocurrency, it carries immense weight. Their “On Chain” report isn’t just a casual observation; it’s a meticulously researched document that delves into the mechanics and potential of digital assets. By highlighting Ethereum as a key player in the stablecoin market, BoA is effectively validating a significant segment of the digital economy. This recognition from a top-tier bank signals a maturing perspective on cryptocurrencies, moving beyond mere speculation to acknowledging their foundational role in future financial infrastructure. What does this mean for the broader crypto market ? Firstly, it lends credibility. For years, digital assets operated on the fringes, often dismissed by mainstream finance. Now, we’re seeing a shift where major banks are not only studying but actively acknowledging the utility and potential of blockchain networks. This can pave the way for: Increased Mainstream Acceptance: As more traditional institutions engage, the perception of crypto shifts from niche to legitimate. Regulatory Clarity: Bank interest often precedes regulatory frameworks. BoA’s report could encourage clearer guidelines, fostering a more secure environment for growth. Enhanced Investment Flows: Institutional validation can open doors for more conservative investors who previously shied away from the perceived volatility and uncertainty of the crypto space. This report is more than just an analysis; it’s a strategic indicator of the direction traditional finance is likely to take, viewing certain digital assets not as competitors but as integral components of a modernized financial ecosystem. Ethereum’s Unrivaled Dominance in the Stablecoin Sector The report emphasizes a critical statistic: over 50% of all stablecoins currently reside on the Ethereum network. This isn’t by chance; it’s a testament to Ethereum’s robust infrastructure, network effects, and pioneering role in smart contracts. But what makes Ethereum the preferred home for these dollar-pegged digital assets? Ethereum’s Core Strengths for Stablecoins: First-Mover Advantage & Network Effect: Ethereum was the first blockchain to offer a widely adopted smart contract platform, enabling the creation of tokens like ERC-20, which stablecoins utilize. This led to a powerful network effect, attracting developers, users, and liquidity. Security and Decentralization: As one of the most decentralized and battle-tested blockchains, Ethereum offers a high degree of security. This is paramount for stablecoins, which often represent significant value and require unwavering reliability. Vast Developer Ecosystem: Ethereum boasts the largest and most active developer community in the blockchain space. This ensures continuous innovation, maintenance, and the creation of tools and protocols that benefit stablecoin issuers. Interoperability with DeFi: The vast majority of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are built on Ethereum. Stablecoins are the lifeblood of DeFi, used for lending, borrowing, trading, and yield farming. This deep integration makes Ethereum the natural habitat for stablecoins seeking utility and liquidity. While challenges like high gas fees have historically plagued Ethereum, ongoing upgrades (like the transition to Proof-of-Stake and the development of Layer-2 scaling solutions such as Arbitrum and Optimism) are addressing these issues, further solidifying its position. The fact that the majority of stablecoin value is locked on Ethereum underscores its fundamental importance to the digital economy, making it a powerful force for stability and growth. What Drives Institutional Adoption of Stablecoins? The Bank of America report points to growing institutional adoption as a key driver for stablecoin expansion, which in turn benefits Ethereum . But why are traditional financial institutions, corporations, and large-scale investors increasingly looking at stablecoins? Key Drivers for Institutional Interest: Driver Explanation Efficiency & Speed Stablecoins enable near-instantaneous, 24/7 transfers of value globally, bypassing traditional banking hours and lengthy settlement times. This is crucial for cross-border payments and inter-company transfers. Reduced Costs Compared to traditional wire transfers or international payment systems, stablecoin transactions often incur significantly lower fees, especially for large volumes. Programmability Built on smart contract platforms like Ethereum, stablecoins can be programmed for specific uses, enabling automated payments, escrow services, and complex financial instruments without intermediaries. Access to DeFi Yields Institutions can deploy stablecoin holdings into DeFi protocols to earn yields that often surpass those available in traditional finance, creating new revenue streams. Hedging & Liquidity Stablecoins provide a stable, liquid on-ramp and off-ramp for crypto trading, allowing institutions to quickly move in and out of volatile assets without converting back to fiat. This growing interest from institutional players is a game-changer. Their participation brings not just capital but also a demand for robust infrastructure, regulatory clarity, and enterprise-grade solutions, all of which indirectly bolster the underlying networks like Ethereum that host these assets. The Future of Stablecoins: Navigating Regulatory Momentum The phrase “regulatory momentum” is a powerful one in the context of stablecoins. As Bank of America suggests, clear and consistent regulation is not a hindrance but a catalyst for widespread adoption. The current landscape for stablecoins is fragmented, with different jurisdictions proposing various approaches. However, a global push towards comprehensive frameworks is undeniable. Why Regulation is Crucial for Stablecoins and Ethereum: Consumer Protection: Regulations aim to protect users by ensuring stablecoins are adequately backed and transparently managed. Financial Stability: Governments and central banks want to ensure stablecoins don’t pose systemic risks to the broader financial system. Combating Illicit Activities: Clear rules help prevent stablecoins from being used for money laundering or terrorist financing. Fostering Innovation: Paradoxically, well-defined regulations can encourage innovation by providing certainty for businesses and developers. For Ethereum , the impact of regulatory clarity on stablecoins is profoundly positive. If stablecoins gain clear legal standing and operational guidelines, their utility and adoption will explode. This would translate directly into increased transaction volume, network usage, and fee generation for Ethereum, further solidifying its economic model and potentially increasing its value as stablecoin adoption expands, as analysts suggest. The U.S., EU, and other major economies are actively debating and implementing stablecoin legislation. The emergence of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) also plays into this narrative, as governments explore their own digital currency options, potentially coexisting with or influencing the trajectory of private stablecoins. Beyond Stablecoins: How This Impacts the Broader Ethereum Ecosystem While the Bank of America report specifically highlights Ethereum ‘s role in stablecoins, the implications extend far beyond this single use case. The increased usage and institutional interest driven by stablecoins have a ripple effect across the entire Ethereum ecosystem and the broader crypto market . Benefits for Ethereum’s Growth: Increased Network Revenue: More stablecoin transactions mean more gas fees paid to the network. With Ethereum’s EIP-1559 upgrade, a portion of these fees is burned, making ETH a deflationary asset over time. Enhanced Security: Higher network usage and value locked in stablecoins incentivize more validators to secure the Proof-of-Stake network, making it even more robust against attacks. Developer Magnet: A thriving ecosystem with clear institutional interest attracts more talented developers, leading to more innovative applications and services built on Ethereum. Value Accrual: As a foundational layer for such a significant part of the digital economy, Ethereum’s native asset, ETH, is positioned to accrue value from the growth of stablecoins and the broader DeFi landscape they underpin. Catalyst for Layer-2 Adoption: The demand for efficient stablecoin transfers on Ethereum pushes the adoption of Layer-2 scaling solutions, which will ultimately benefit the entire network’s scalability. The synergy is clear: the success of stablecoins on Ethereum directly contributes to the health and growth of the Ethereum network itself. This feedback loop creates a powerful positive cycle, cementing Ethereum’s status as a critical piece of the future financial infrastructure. Challenges and Opportunities Ahead Despite the optimistic outlook, challenges remain. Competition from other Layer-1 blockchains vying for stablecoin dominance, the ongoing need for scalable solutions, and the complexities of global regulatory harmonization are all factors that will shape the future. However, these challenges also present immense opportunities for innovation and collaboration within the crypto space. For individuals and institutions, understanding these dynamics is crucial. The insights from Bank of America provide a valuable lens through which to view the evolving digital asset landscape. It’s a testament to the fact that cryptocurrencies, particularly those with strong fundamentals and real-world utility like Ethereum, are increasingly becoming undeniable forces in global finance.

In a July 2 letter obtained by The Canadian Press , Chew asked to meet within two weeks, pointing out the order dates back to when a U.S. ban on the app seemed likely. He pointed out the directive followed a national security review conducted under the Investment Canada Act, which lets Ottawa examine any foreign investment that might threaten national security. “There is no upside to this outdated and counterproductive government order, which was issued under a different government and in a different era, and which doesn’t reflect today’s reality,” Chew wrote. When François‑Philippe Champagne was industry minister, he said the government acted to address “specific national security risks,” though he did not spell out what those risks were. Critics have pointed to Chinese laws that can force companies like ByteDance Ltd. to assist in intelligence gathering as the core concern. Tiktok challenges national security grounds Chew argued no evidence has ever been shown that TikTok poses a security threat to Canada, and he said officials have been unwilling to discuss possible fixes. He suggested steps such as stronger data‑security protocols, plus more transparency and outside oversight, could ease Ottawa’s worries. Last November, following a national security review of its parent company ByteDance Ltd., Ottawa ordered the Canadian subsidiary to be dismantled. Despite that, the app remains available to its 14 million Canadian users, but would no longer have any presence or representatives within Canada’s jurisdiction. Chew cautioned that enforcing the requirement would isolate Canada from its international partners, particularly those in the Five Eyes intelligence coalition, none of which have taken comparable measures. He added the decision appears rooted in “assumptions about TikTok’s future in the United States which no longer hold true.” The federal review began in late 2023 but remained confidential until March 2024, shortly after the U.S. House of Representatives approved legislation targeting TikTok unless ByteDance divested. In June, President Donald Trump again extended the U.S. deadline for banning the app for a third time. TikTok warns of major layoffs and investment cuts Chew warned that failure to intervene would force TikTok to lay off over 350 staff in Canada, halt direct investments here and scale back support for domestic creators and cultural initiatives. “The wind‑up process is rapidly approaching a critical juncture,” he wrote. He highlighted that TikTok’s Canadian staff have appeared before parliamentary committees, worked with regulators, trained law enforcement on lawful‑access requests and assisted Elections Canada during last year’s federal vote. “TikTok maintaining a presence in Canada means there is a local team who is accountable to Canadian policy‑makers and authorities,” he wrote. On July 7, the company said it would stop sponsoring major Canadian arts events like the Juno Awards and TIFF.A spokeswoman for the minister declined to comment on whether Joly has responded or intends to meet Chew. Separately, TikTok has filed a challenge in Federal Court against the shutdown directive, contending that Ottawa’s actions “bear no rational connection to the national security risks it identifies.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

48252595,https://cryptonews.com/?p=382090,1752535036,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/48252595.jpeg,"ChatGPT Predicts the Price of XRP, Pi Coin, and Dogecoin by the End of 2025",https://cryptonews.com/news/chatgpt-predicts-the-price-of-xrp-pi-coin-and-dogecoin-by-the-end-of-2025/,"OpenAI’s ChatGPT predicts that leading altcoins could establish new record highs in the second half of 2025, riding the momentum of Bitcoin’s explosive rally. Earlier today, Bitcoin rose to a new historic high watermark of $122,838, marking an all-time high with further gains appearing likely. If the momentum holds, global adoption could be just around the corner. This breakout has fuelled strong optimism among crypto enthusiasts, sparking speculation that an even more powerful bull market than the legendary 2021 run may be developing, with multiple top altcoins expected to achieve unprecedented valuations. Outlined below are several digital assets that OpenAI’s ChatGPT predicts hold substantial near-term growth prospects. XRP (Ripple): ChatGPT Predicts This Cross-Border Payments Leader to Double with Ease According to ChatGPT’s projections, Ripple’s XRP could climb to $20 by late 2025, which would equate to a nearly sevenfold increase from its current level around $2.99. This bullish scenario is driven by a combination of growing institutional usage, enhanced regulatory clarity, and mounting speculation about a potential XRP spot ETF that could unlock broader retail and institutional inflows. Additionally, XRP continues to gain recognition for allowing fast, affordable, and compliant international payments. In 2024, the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) commended XRP’s ability to facilitate immediate cross-border transfers without conventional intermediaries. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!! UN Endorses @Ripple and @StellarOrg as Cornerstones of New Global Payments Network! #XRP and #XLM will run the new financial system! pic.twitter.com/ufewexCKmR — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 13, 2024 A pivotal U.S. court decision in 2023 ruled that XRP’s retail transactions did not constitute securities, undermining longstanding SEC claims. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed in March that the protracted legal battle had concluded, removing a key overhang and bolstering market sentiment towards XRP and other altcoins. Looking ahead, the $3 resistance zone is viewed as a major barrier. If XRP can decisively break above its current level in the coming months, ChatGPT’s more conservative $10 target by year-end becomes highly plausible. However, reaching the more ambitious $20 price tag will depend on further regulatory advancements in the U.S. and stabilising political dynamics in regions such as the Middle East. Additionally, among major cryptocurrencies, XRP has been a standout performer, rallying 464% over the past year versus Bitcoin’s 100% rise. Pi Network ($PI): ChatGPT Predicts This Mobile Mining Project Could 10X by Year-End Pi Network has revolutionised the mining sector with its innovative “tap-to-mine” approach, allowing individuals to mine crypto directly from their smartphones without specialised hardware or technical expertise. From its current value near $0.4639, ChatGPT predicts that Pi Network could surge more than tenfold to hit $5 by the end of the year. Instead of resource-intensive mining, users earn PI tokens simply by opening the app and tapping daily – a mechanism that has proven especially attractive to newcomers in the crypto space. Launched in February 2025, $PI has exhibited significant volatility. In early May, it rocketed from $0.58 to $1.57 within just four days, a dramatic 171% gain driven by renewed institutional interest. Currently, PI’s RSI stands at 39 and is climbing, reflecting an underbought asset with strengthening bullish momentum as green candles sweep across the wider crypto market. If this trend continues, $PI may surpass its critical $3 resistance level this summer, setting a new record above February’s all-time high of $2.99. Thanks to its intuitive app and scalable Layer-1 blockchain, Pi Network is well-positioned to accelerate mass adoption, potentially reaching $5 even without a full-scale bull market, though broad user growth and regulatory approvals in the U.S. will be vital to achieving ChatGPT’s loftiest projections. Dogecoin ($DOGE): The Original Meme Coin Primed for a Major Comeback Finally, Dogecoin ($DOGE) , the first meme coin, maintains a robust market valuation of approximately $30.9 billion. Initially created in 2013 as a joke, it has since evolved into a legitimate crypto asset with widespread utility and a dedicated global community. Often moving in sync with Bitcoin, Dogecoin combines meme-driven volatility with surprising long-term resilience. Currently trading at $0.20 and showing little change over the past day, DOGE’s RSI is at 65 and trending upwards, suggesting accumulating buyer interest as Bitcoin continues its rally. Technical charts indicate a steep falling wedge pattern from November through April, signalling strong potential for a sharp upward breakout. ChatGPT predicts that DOGE could rise to $1.50 in a bullish market phase, representing a possible 7.5X return. On the adoption side, Dogecoin continues to receive strong corporate and celebrity endorsements. Tesla accepts DOGE for certain merchandise purchases, while platforms like Revolut and PayPal have integrated it into their payment offerings, strengthening its mainstream utility. TOKEN6900: Could This Emerging Meme Coin Deliver 1000x Returns? While ChatGPT remains bullish on established altcoins, their massive market caps often limit their explosive growth potential. For traders aiming for exponential gains, lesser-known meme coins might offer sharper upside. One such project is TOKEN6900 (T6900) , an ERC-20 meme token that launched its presale barely a week ago. Hey Siri, define aura pic.twitter.com/NVYT1pZmed — Token6900 (@Token_6900) July 8, 2025 TOKEN6900 has already secured around half a million dollars from early investors, reflecting strong market interest and the potential for a powerful launch rally. Unlike meme coins that attempt to pivot towards utility, TOKEN6900 embraces its identity as a purely hype-fueled asset, using irony, aggressive marketing, and FOMO to drive momentum. Its website boldly declares: “It’s Not Built On Fundamentals. It’s Built On Delusion, Irony, And The Collective Hallucination Of Terminally Online Traders.” Inspired by SPX6900, another meme token celebrating absurdist dot-com aesthetics, TOKEN6900 has a total supply of 930,993,091 tokens—exactly one more than SPX6900’s original supply, emphasising its competitive branding. This strategy appears to be resonating, as evidenced by its strong presale performance. While lacking inherent utility, holders can stake tokens for additional yield alongside speculative price gains. Interested participants can purchase T6900 via its official website at a current presale price of $0.006575. With prices set to increase within 24 hours, those aiming for the lowest possible entry point may wish to act promptly.

Simultaneously, numerous top-tier altcoins and the best meme coins —such as TRON, Sui Network, Solana, Pepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin—have recorded fresh highs in recent months, reinforcing the perspective that both sectors still hold substantial growth opportunities. As anticipation builds for the next major bull run, investors are zeroing in on select crypto assets that could potentially eclipse their prior all-time price highs. Ripple (XRP): Cross-Border Payments Crypto Arguably Price Performer of the Year Ripple’s XRP continues to strengthen its position as a key connector between traditional banking infrastructures and blockchain-based remittance networks. Its capability to allow near-instant global transactions at minimal fees has attracted notable institutional interest. The United Nations has even recognised XRP as a feasible solution for transferring funds internationally without reliance on traditional intermediaries. After enduring years of legal challenges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple secured a pivotal legal victory in 2023 when a court ruled that retail sales of XRP did not constitute securities transactions. The SEC officially dropped the case in 2025, ending the four-year litigation. This outcome solidified XRP’s standing within the industry, creating an important regulatory benchmark for the wider crypto market. Investor confidence surged following this development, driving XRP’s price up by over 464% within a year, outperforming Bitcoin’s 103% gain over the same period. XRP faces stiff resistance at its current level of around $3, but it’s likely to smash through this as arguably the biggest success story among the billion cap altcoins. Earlier this year, a bullish flag pattern formed across its support and resistance lines, suggesting the possibility of a surge towards $3.50 this summer, surpassing its previous peak of $3.40 set in January 2018. Pepe ($PEPE): Meme Coin Giant Targets Fresh Record Highs Pepe ($PEPE) has carved out its place among the top three meme coins, driven by the meme’s cultural popularity and strong market performance. Inspired by Matt Furie’s iconic cartoon frog, $PEPE has generated massive returns for early investors and now ranks among the top three meme tokens, with a market valuation exceeding $4.6 billion. pic.twitter.com/jR6ycgAYjc — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 9, 2025 Launched in April 2023, Pepe triggered a wave of copycat tokens, though none have managed to match its momentum or staying power. Its rise gained further traction when Elon Musk briefly adopted a Pepe-themed profile picture on X (formerly Twitter). Currently priced around $0.00001235, $PEPE has posted gains of 23% in the past week, although it is still approximately 56% below its all-time high of $0.00002803 set in late 2024, technical analysts observed a falling wedge pattern in Q1, a formation typically indicative of an incoming upward price breakout. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reached 65, indicating strengthening bullish momentum, suggesting limited further potential gains for $PEPE through the week as it is close to 70, which typically signals an over-priced asset, triggering a selloff. If macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions remain stable, Pepe may embark on another major rally before summer ends. Cardano ($ADA): Can This Eco-Friendly Crypto Set New Price Highs in 2025? Interest in Cardano ($ADA) is on the rise, bolstered by institutional backing and positive technical indicators. Like XRP and Solana, Cardano was named by Donald Trump as a possible reserve crypto asset for inclusion in a proposed U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Founded in 2014 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano is acclaimed for its research-driven development model and energy-efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus, which spurred Ethereum’s own transition from Proof-of-Work to PoS. With a market capitalisation of $27.4 billion, ADA would need to more than triple in value to surpass Solana and challenge Ethereum’s market dominance. In the last seven days, Cardano outperformed Bitcoin during the market-wide rally, adding 27% to its price while Bitcoin only grew 12%. Current projections suggest ADA could climb from its present price of $0.76 to nearly $2 by mid-year. More bullish forecasts anticipate a full recovery to its previous all-time high of $3.09, marking a rebound from its 75.5% drop since September 2021. Strong support levels and a bullish flag formation observed between November and April hint at continued upside potential, although ADA’s RSI has strayed into overbought territory at 72, which means traders will be doing a spot of profit-taking that could depreciate the price over the week. The next immediate level of resistance is at $1.15, but ADA enjoys strong support in the $0.85 to $0.90 range. Seeking the Next Explosive Altcoin?

The Spanish news agency EFE (via MSN ) reported that the Sumar group of MPs wants the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) to use the system for retail investors. The group says that the system would let users “clearly and visually” identify the type of asset they are purchasing. Sumar has sent a written proposal to the regulator. The group complained that a “significant portion” of tokens traded on crypto exchange platforms “lack material backing or any underlying value.” Spanish lending giant BBVA said it won approval to launch Bitcoin and Ether trading, integrating crypto into everyday banking. #BBVA #CryptoTrading https://t.co/ifB7FxuUV8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 10, 2025 Traffic Light Crypto Warnings Coming to Spain? The parliamentary group also wants to rename cryptoassets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) . It proposes using terms like “crypto bets” or “unbacked assets.” The lawmakers justified their request by explaining that coins “do not grant their owners any rights to tangible assets or have any connection to productive activities.” The traffic light warning system would see the CNMV apply one of three labels to each cryptoasset on an exchange or bank’s investing platform. The regulator would give a green light to cryptoassets that are registered, supported, and supervised. These coins would also need to demonstrate stable market performance. It would use yellow for cryptoassets that have “limited backing” or display moderate volatility. An orange light would identify “unsupervised” coins with high risk levels. And a final red label would be reserved for “speculative assets with no identified issuer or material backing.” Europe’s markets regulator criticized crypto oversight in Malta for falling short in several areas related to an unidentified entity it authorized https://t.co/BQrJYufB9B — Bloomberg (@business) July 10, 2025 Crypto Concentrates Wealth, Say Lawmakers Sumar said it is wary of “extreme forms of fictitious capital that do not generate value, but rather generate volatility, inequality, and wealth concentration.” Carlos Martín Urriza, the Sumar spokesperson for Economy and Finance, said policymakers should protect retail investors from assets that are not backed by a verified asset or collateral. Carlos Martín Urriza, the Sumar spokesperson for Economy and Finance. (Source: elDiarioes/YouTube) He added that crypto trading is often more similar to betting than to investing. Furthermore, Sumar wants the CNMV to force banks and exchanges to ensure their customers read pre-purchase information on cryptoassets before allowing them to buy coins. This should apply regardless of a token’s individual classification, Sumar said. It added that these mandatory warnings must be clearly summarized and contain visual elements. Sumar suggested that the CNMV use prominent warning systems. It said the regulator should base its models on those already used in sectors such as gambling or tobacco sales. Restrict Access to AI-powered Trading, MPs Urge Sumar lawmakers also want to create specific regulations for algorithmic trading pools. And the group wants to restrict retail investors’ access to trading platforms that use AI or algorithms.

One notable figure within the community, known as The5Blairs, recently presented a scenario in which the value of 10,000 XRP could grow to $33.8 million. This projection is based on a potential price increase to $3,380 per token. A Breakdown of the $33.8M Estimate At the time The5Blairs made this projection, XRP was valued at approximately $2.20. His analysis relied on the token’s transaction velocity and annual settlement volume. According to his findings, XRP facilitates around $1.3 trillion in yearly transaction value, with a circulating supply of about 60 billion coins and a transaction velocity of 10. He stated that with further expansion, especially through new partnerships and institutional adoption, XRP could potentially support between $100 trillion and $2 quadrillion in annual transactional volume. Based on that assumption, and using proportional valuation metrics, he estimated that XRP’s price would need to increase more than 1,500-fold from $2.20 to approximately $3,380 to handle that level of utility. Currently, XRP is trading around $2.98 , making 10,000 units worth roughly $29,800. Based on The5Blairs’ forecast, an investor holding this amount could see their investment grow dramatically if such projections are realized. Similarly, smaller holdings would still yield considerable returns, for example, 1,000 XRP could translate to $3.38 million, while 50,000 XRP might be valued at over $169 million in this scenario. Notably, Edoardo Farina , founder of Alpha Lions Academy, has consistently advocated for long-term holding, urging investors to maintain at least 10,000 XRP. He emphasizes the importance of patience, noting that the asset’s potential could reward disciplined holders significantly over time. Key Developments That May Influence XRP’s Growth Several factors underpin this price outlook. A significant one is Ripple’s extensive network of business relationships, many of which are formalized through non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). During Ripple’s legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it was revealed that the company had signed more than 1,700 NDAs since 2013 with a variety of banks, financial service providers, and technology firms. These partnerships suggest broader institutional interest that could translate into future adoption of the XRP Ledger. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another catalyst is Ripple’s growing involvement in the cross-border payments sector. In a statement from June 2025, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse noted that the XRP Ledger could eventually support up to 14% of SWIFT’s global transaction volume. Given that SWIFT processes an estimated $150 trillion annually, XRP could potentially account for $21 trillion in payment flow within the next five years if that target is achieved. In addition, The5Blairs emphasized the opportunity for XRP to play a role in the global derivatives and foreign exchange markets. With the notional value of global derivatives estimated at over $1 quadrillion, capturing even a small fraction could generate substantial demand for the token. Nonetheless, it remains uncertain how much of this market XRP can realistically absorb. Further reinforcing optimism around XRP is Ripple’s increasing presence in major financial infrastructure. Earlier in 2025, Ripple’s subsidiary, Hidden Road, became part of the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC)’s government securities netting platform. The DTCC processes over $2 quadrillion in transactions annually, and Ripple’s involvement through Hidden Road could indicate a gradual move toward integration. Recent DTCC patent applications mentioning Ripple and XRP have further fueled speculation, although no official announcements have been made regarding formal partnerships. While these projections are highly speculative and depend on several complex market variables, they reflect the growing confidence within the XRP community. Investors and analysts continue to monitor developments surrounding Ripple’s partnerships, market expansion, and potential use cases, all of which could significantly influence the token’s long-term value trajectory.

This comes despite all the buzz surrounding the technology. During a call with analysts on Monday, Lambert said stablecoins boast incredible technical potential — fast transactions, 24/7 uptime, low fees, programmability, and immutability. But those features alone don’t make them ready for everyday payments. He noted that people also need a frictionless user experience, broad accessibility, and consumer distribution. Mastercard eyes role as key infrastructure provider for stablecoin adoption Mastercard sees itself as the connective tissue between the world of crypto and traditional finance . Lambert emphasized that Mastercard can offer the kind of infrastructure — global acceptance, security protocols, and regulatory compliance — needed to help stablecoins scale and become useful at checkout. This vision isn’t new. Mastercard and rival Visa have been exploring stablecoin initiatives since at least 2021. Mastercard recently partnered with Paxos to support the minting and redemption of the USDG stablecoin. The company also backs stablecoins like FIUSD from Fiserv, PYUSD from PayPal, and USDC from Circle, signaling its long-term ambition to power the backend of stablecoin transactions. Consumer friction and low utility keep stablecoins from mainstream use Lambert notes that about 90% of stablecoin usage today is still tied to crypto trading, not consumer purchases. While companies like Coinbase and Shopify have made moves to enable stablecoin payments for everyday goods and services, significant barriers remain, particularly user adoption and checkout friction. Lambert highlighted that existing stablecoins do not presently offer a compelling use case for peer-to-merchant payments. He likened them to prepaid cards, with the ability for users to spend their wallet balance with some merchants, although the feature set is limited. Despite the common narrative being that stablecoins can be used to circumvent card networks and the transaction fees that are paid to process transactions, Mastercard and the rest are attempting to flip the script, presenting themselves as necessary allies who can help increase stablecoin utility by integrating them into established payment rails. Mastercard’s Chief Commercial Payments Officer Raj Seshadri added that stablecoins have hidden complexities. “You still need to convert to and from fiat. That adds costs — not just the price of the stablecoin itself, but also the FX, regulation, settlement, and ramping infrastructure.” Still others hold counter opinions. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller recently said that stablecoins will bolster competition in the payments system, and that was a positive direction. Speaking at an event at the Dallas Fed, Waller said that the rise of stablecoins will make many payments cheaper and faster. He noted, “And that’s the goal for me, as a free-market capitalist economist, is that I want competition in payments to drive down the cost for households, consumers, and businesses. That’s it.” With stablecoin regulation gaining traction in the US, banks and institutions increasingly weigh their role in this evolving space. Regulatory clarity is prompting some to explore offering stablecoins or deposit tokens to retain deposits that might otherwise flow into digital wallets. According to Lambert, every financial institution evaluates whether it needs to issue stablecoins and what the right product-market fit might be. For many, the focus is on avoiding a loss of control over customer deposits. Beyond the private sector, Lambert noted that governments and central banks are also taking a closer look at digital currencies, aiming to support innovation while preventing dollarization in their domestic economies. “We expect to see a wide range of approaches emerge globally,” he said. The crypto industry is moving closer to mainstream adoption as Congress advances a slate of pro-crypto bills this week. Dubbed “ crypto week ” by the Republican-led House, the legislative push includes a landmark bill to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, potentially heading to President Donald Trump’s desk for approval.

Here’s What It Means for Ripple,https://timestabloid.com/federal-reserve-implements-iso-20022-heres-what-it-means-for-ripple/,"The U.S. Federal Reserve has officially transitioned its FedWire Funds Service to the ISO 20022 messaging standard, a move that could significantly benefit Ripple, which has been ISO 20022-ready for years. Effective from today, July 14, 2025, all institutions using the FedWire Funds Service are now required to process transactions using ISO 20022 . This transition, originally scheduled for March 2025 but postponed to provide additional preparation time, marks a critical step in modernizing the U.S. financial system. ISO 20022 is a globally adopted framework for electronic data exchange between financial institutions. It provides standardized formats that support detailed and structured messaging. This not only enhances data clarity but also streamlines transaction processing, reduces errors, and strengthens regulatory compliance, especially for cross-border payments. By the end of 2025, projections suggest that over 80% of international financial flows will utilize ISO 20022. As adoption accelerates worldwide, it is quickly becoming the default protocol across the banking and payments industry. Ripple’s Early Adoption Gives It a Competitive Edge Ripple positioned itself early to capitalize on the global shift to ISO 20022. In 2020, it became the first blockchain company to join the ISO 20022 Standards Body. Since then, Ripple has aligned its infrastructure, particularly RippleNet, to meet the standard’s requirements. RippleNet supports structured financial messaging in accordance with ISO 20022, enabling seamless integration with traditional banks and financial entities that rely on the same format. This compliance enhances the platform’s speed, transparency, and interoperability, critical features for modern financial institutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Although XRP, Ripple’s native cryptocurrency, is not an ISO 20022 messaging token, it remains integral to RippleNet’s operations. XRP is primarily used in Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service, now known as Ripple Payments, which facilitates instant currency conversion and settlement, eliminating the need for pre-funded accounts. Implications for Ripple in the U.S. Market The Federal Reserve’s adoption of ISO 20022 could increase demand for payment infrastructure that already supports the standard. Ripple, having implemented ISO 20022-compliant messaging well in advance, is well-positioned to assist U.S. financial institutions through this transition. In addition to its technical readiness, Ripple is actively expanding its presence in the American financial landscape. The company recently applied for a U.S. banking license and a Federal Reserve master account for RLUSD, Ripple’s upcoming stablecoin. These developments suggest Ripple is working to deepen its involvement in the domestic banking sector. As more U.S. banks seek partners that can meet ISO 20022 standards, Ripple’s early adoption and proven infrastructure could prove advantageous, potentially driving greater adoption of its services across the regulated financial ecosystem.

Who’s Really Winning?",https://thecoinrise.com/while-subbd-builds-early-buzz-blockdag-secures-338m-expands-reach-with-seattle-sports-deals-whos-really-winning/,"The SUBBD presale has begun making the rounds, pulling in $750,000 and drawing early attention from altcoin fans. With a price still low enough to create buzz and growing talk around the next altcoin cycle, the setup is working in its favor. But while SUBBD builds early traction, another name has already captured the spotlight and a massive slice of the market. BlockDAG (BDAG) has passed $338 million in funds raised and locked partnerships with two professional Seattle sports franchises, taking a clear lead in visibility and execution. While SUBBD is still getting its footing, BlockDAG has already delivered measurable results and built out real-world connections. Early Days for SUBBD: Can the Hype Hold? SUBBD’s presale has reached $750,000, sparking growing interest among those watching for the next altcoin breakout. With a low entry price and strong community push, the project is starting to build traction. Market sentiment is leaning optimistic, and that’s helping more traders take notice of early-stage coins like SUBBD. The project claims it aims to simplify DeFi by offering a smoother interface, easier staking features, and a better user experience overall. These upgrades are part of what’s being promised in future rollouts, though most of the features are still in the development phase. As of now, much of the buzz is based on potential rather than working products. That hasn’t stopped chatter from picking up online. Social engagement is on the rise, and daily buy-ins are increasing, showing a steady uptick in early participation. Still, the project will need to follow through with real progress. For now, SUBBD is in the spotlight, but staying there will depend on execution, not just excitement. BlockDAG Delivers on Price and Partnerships! BlockDAG is pushing forward fast. The project has already raised $338 million, with 23.8 billion coins sold across multiple batches. It’s currently in Batch 29, where the regular price is $0.0276. However, as part of the GLOBAL LAUNCH release, buyers can still access a special price of $0.0016 until August 11. With the confirmed launch price set at $0.05, this gives users a chance to lock in a 3,025% return. Those who joined back in Batch 1 are already sitting on a 2,660% gain compared to the current launch rate. Beyond strong pricing and presale performance, BlockDAG is also scoring big on real-world exposure. The project has partnered with two professional Seattle sports teams, the Seattle Orcas and the Seattle Seawolves. These teams bring loyal fan bases and major league attention, helping BlockDAG reach audiences beyond just crypto circles. These aren’t shallow branding deals. They’re part of a broader push to build credibility, drive mass adoption, and make BlockDAG a household name in and outside of crypto. While many projects promise big things and stay in development mode, BlockDAG is already delivering results. From major sports partnerships to pricing momentum, it’s turning plans into action. The numbers, the strategy, and the visibility all show that BlockDAG is already ahead of the curve, and still climbing. Two Coins, Two Different Paths SUBBD is still in the early stages, and its low entry price is helping it gain attention. Early optimism is there, and the project could ride future market momentum. But hype alone won’t carry it forever. The gap between early buzz and long-term success is often bigger than expected. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is already making big moves. It has raised $338 million, sold 23.8 billion coins, and built partnerships with two major teams. This isn’t just about talking a good game, it’s real action, real numbers, and a growing base of support. Where SUBBD is working to build its name, BlockDAG has already carved out a spot. While both projects are on the map, only one has real traction right now. In this space, timing counts. But results matter even more, and BlockDAG has both. The Bottom Line SUBBD is seeing early success, and the price is drawing in attention. If the overall market stays positive, more people could jump into the presale. Still, it’s a wait-and-see situation, as the project’s promises are yet to be proven. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is all about delivery. With $338 million raised and 23.8 billion coins already sold, the project has momentum, and now, major partnerships with the Seattle Orcas and Seawolves to back it up. The GLOBAL LAUNCH release price of $0.0016, valid until August 11, makes it even more appealing. At launch, the $0.05 price locks in a 3,025% return. SUBBD is still trying to build its case. BlockDAG is already making its mark.

Currently, technical indicators, surging liquidity, and macroeconomic tailwinds have analysts predicting that the leading cryptocurrency is on the verge of a parabolic surge to a $140,000 top in the next few weeks. $140,000 Set As Bitcoin Next Top Target The Bitcoin price is exhibiting remarkable strength as it continues its parabolic advance beyond the $123,000 range. Technical indicators identified by crypto analyst Mr. Wall Street are now aligning around a new short-term target between $135,000 and $140,000. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices Are Surging Today According to the market expert’s chart report, BTC has successfully broken out of a Broadening Wedge pattern after consolidating between a descending support and horizontal resistance for nearly two months. The decisive breakout above the $112,000 resistance validates the analyst’s earlier bullish projections. Initially, the analyst proposed two possible scenarios: A breakout above all-time highs around $112,000 leading directly to a $117,000-$120,000 rally or a brief dip to $92,000 to fill the CME gap before continuing up toward the same target zone. Based on its recent price movement, Bitcoin has chosen to follow the first scenario, underscoring the strength of its bullish momentum and signaling that short-term Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) has had little to no effect. With the second scenario officially invalidated, BTC’s price trajectory is seemingly clearer and higher. The recent surge above $123,000 has also spotlighted the next major liquidity pool between $135,000 and $140,000. The chart highlights that reaching this zone would liquidate over $45 billion in short positions. Following this, the next target zone sits between $160,000 and $170,000, threatening another $70 billion in short liquidations. M2 Surge And MACD Fuel BTC’s Bullish Case Mr. Wall Street’s bullish setup for Bitcoin is further supported by macroeconomic and key chart indicators. The analyst pointed to US President Donald Trump’s recent approval of a bill to raise the country’s debt ceiling—a move that signals accelerating debt growth. This, in turn, is expected to expand M2 money supply, which historically correlates with rising prices for assets like Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Repeat Parabolic Phase From 2017 And 2021? Here’s The Target BTC’s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also remains fully intact across all time frames, while the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio is still well below historic top levels. In addition, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has yet to enter overbought territory. These indicators confirm that Bitcoin is still far from a macro top, making the $135,000 – $140,000 range a plausible interim target. Looking ahead, Mr. Wall Street emphasizes that Bitcoin has entered a supercycle, a phase where the market is marked by price discovery. While he acknowledges the possibility of a short-term retest of the $112,000 level before continuing upward, the analyst maintains that, regardless of minor pullbacks, the price action from here is likely to be swift and aggressive.

According to the NY Times sources, senior team members, including Meta’s freshly appointed chief AI officer, 28‑year‑old Alexandr Wang met last week to debate pausing the release of their most advanced publicly available model, Behemoth. The focus was instead on developing a proprietary version. Meta used to make its AI code public so other developers could build on it. A closed‑source model keeps the code private, but Meta argues that sharing openly speeds up progress and gives more people access to powerful tools. Switching to a private model would be a big change for Meta, which developers have praised for its open‑source approach. As recently as last year, Yann LeCun, one of Meta’s top AI researchers, asserted that “the platform that will win will be the open one.” Earlier this year, the Chinese venture DeepSeek leveraged Meta’s public code to create its own sophisticated AI chatbot, underscoring the tangible value of openness. Although Meta finished training Behemoth on extensive datasets aimed at maximizing its capabilities, sources report that the rollout was postponed after initial in‑house evaluations fell short of projected benchmarks. Following the inauguration of its superintelligence division last month, the Behemoth project considered a “frontier” effort at the leading edge of AI development, was put on hold pending further review. These talks are still early with no decisions made, and any change would need CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s approval. Meta could keep its public models while also building a private one. Either way, moving toward a private model would be a big strategic shift as it tries to keep upwith rivals like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic. In a podcast interview last year, Zuckerberg said, “We’re obviously very pro open source, but I haven’t committed to releasing every single thing that we do.” Meta’s new lab is under scrutiny after several AI missteps Meta has dealt with management problems, seen key staff depart, and launched products that didn’t catch on. Zuckerberg still wants to build an AI that achieves superintelligence, something some describe as beyond human thinking. To staff the initiative, Zuckerberg initiated an aggressive recruitment campaign, offering nine‑figure compensation proposals to lure leading researchers from OpenAI, Google, Apple, Anthropic, and others. Moreover, he reassigned the executive formerly in charge of Meta’s generative AI division. In June, Meta poured $14.3 billion into Scale AI, the company founded and helmed by Alexandr Wang. The deal granted Meta a 49 % equity share, and Wang, together with some of his key associates, transitioned into senior posts within Meta. Following the investment, Meta rebranded its AI arm as “Meta Superintelligence Labs,” with Wang stepping into the role of chief AI officer. He now leads an elite cohort of about a dozen recent hires, several Scale AI deputies, and Nat Friedman, ex‑CEO of GitHub. Sources indicate that numerous members of Wang’s group gathered at Meta’s Menlo Park headquarters for their inaugural in‑person meeting last week. They occupy a secluded office suite adjacent to Zuckerberg’s workspace. On Tuesday, Wang held a Q&A with about 2,000 AI team members. He said his core team’s work would stay private and that everyone in the AI division would now focus on building superintelligence. Looking forward, some AI employees anticipate that the upcoming vesting window in August, which will allow certain staff to liquidate company shares. It could trigger a wave of departures among those not selected for the superintelligence group. On Monday, Zuckerberg unveiled intentions to commit hundreds of billions of dollars toward AI compute infrastructure, aiming to have Meta’s inaugural supercluster operational by next year. In a Facebook update , Zuckerberg stated, “Meta Superintelligence Labs will have industry‑leading levels of compute and by far the greatest compute per researcher. I’m looking forward to working with the top researchers to advance the frontier!” He called the first supercluster “Prometheus” and disclosed plans for additional multi‑gigawatt installations, such as “Hyperion,” projected to reach five gigawatts over the next few years. Zuckerberg’s moves show he’s frustrated with how slowly Meta’s AI is progressing. After the underweheling response to Llama 4 in April, he is taking a different road to better compete with OpenAI and Google. “For our superintelligence effort, I’m focused on building the most elite and talent‑dense team in the industry,” he added, marking the start of a new phase in Meta’s AI endeavors.

Huang talked to CNN’s Fareed Zarkaria about AI as a positive force . He called it “the greatest technology equalizer the world has ever seen.” As Nvidia’s CEO noted in his paper, there will always be jobs, but AI is expected to alter working practices across every industry and profession. He said everyone else’s job would be 50% less than normal, but that didn’t mean there would be no jobs left for people. Work would change, not vanish, he argued. He said it is one example of how AI enables people who are (or aren’t) computer literate to become more productive. Huang mentioned the number of new users to ChatGPT, saying that even on their first try, they saw value in it. According to him, AI is just about the empowerment of people. On the other hand, Huang underscored that AI is a tool, not a weapon. Its filing times have gone from those built on specialized knowledge to becoming something AI should be able to handle in load times. He says the AI trend is not about devaluing human workers but valuing them more. AI will reshape the workforce with more opportunities Though the Nvidia CEO acknowledged that some jobs could be automated out of existence, he emphasized the potential for new opportunities. Huang said AI is not here to replace humans, but rather “to augment human capabilities.” He foresees new jobs in AI, from training models and engineering prompts to curating data, managing humans, and ensuring AI ethics. This is consistent with earlier shifts during the industrial and digital revolutions, when technology replaced some jobs but created many new industries and jobs. He added that AI was a “co-pilot,” rather than a competitor. Automation of repeatable and boring work can free humans from focusing on creative, strategic, and people work. He said this will improve health, education, financial, and agricultural systems. More crucially, Huang stresses the need for societies to retrain and educate workers to make this transition. People need to be educated to cohabitate and work with the AI, and riding the back of this dragon is the secret to a world and economy that spins ever upward. Nvidia challenges apocalyptic AI predictions Huang’s view contrasts with some of the more dystopian notes of the AI industry. In May, Dario Amodei, the CEO of the $61.5 billion artificial intelligence startup Anthropic, told Axios that AI might be able to strip half of all entry-level white-collar jobs from the global economy within the next five years. He warned that unemployment figures could climb double if the switch isn’t handled well, rebounding from 10% to 20%. In just a year, AI systems could write all the code a business requires, Amodei said. Some, such as Adam Dorr, an employee of the Wells research house RethinkX, believe that AI and robotics could automate away virtually all human labor by 2045. The transition will be difficult, Dorr told The Guardian, and there isn’t much time to get ready for the shift AI will herald. But Huang is still not caving to panic. He believes such doomsday scenarios fail to consider the possibility of AI as a force for good for humanity. “The effect of AI is not so much replacement but transformation,” said Huang. The AI revolution is being driven in no small part by Nvidia, which Huang heads. The company’s chips power some of the world’s most advanced AI models, such as the ones underpinning ChatGPT and other large language models. But Huang insists that such technology should empower, not replace, humans. As the world grapples with adapting its workforce for the era of silicon and artificial intelligence, Nvidia’s CEO offers a clear message: Don’t fear AI—use it to redefine the future of work.

This follows a week of strong gains, with BTC rising by more than 10% amid a broader uptrend in the cryptocurrency market. Despite the minor pullback, market analysts are closely monitoring on-chain and derivatives data to assess whether momentum is building toward a more aggressive phase of the rally. The recent surge has also benefited the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, lifting total global crypto market capitalization to just under $4 trillion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Records: What Miners and Leverage Traders Are Doing Behind the Scenes While Bitcoin continues to dominate in terms of volume and influence, sentiment metrics suggest that traders and investors may still be approaching with measured optimism. According to analysts, several indicators are now pointing to a potential shift in market dynamics that could influence Bitcoin’s next major move. Market Euphoria Not Yet Confirmed CryptoQuant contributor Joao Wedson has offered insights into the current structure of the Bitcoin market through an analysis of the price gap between spot and perpetual futures contracts on Binance. In a recent QuickTake post, Wedson noted that the spot price of Bitcoin continues to outpace the perpetual futures price, a sign that market sentiment has not yet tipped into full euphoria. Historically, a positive gap between the two markets has signaled increased speculative activity and the onset of parabolic rallies. “The gap is still in negative territory,” Wedson stated, “but the narrowing trend indicates that sentiment may be transitioning from cautious to more optimistic.” The analysis implies that traders in the futures market have yet to aggressively price in further upside, possibly waiting for stronger confirmation before deploying leverage. Should this gap flip to positive territory, it could be interpreted as a sign of increased risk appetite, potentially fueling a sharper upward move. Wedson also emphasized the importance of monitoring how derivatives markets respond in the coming days. “If the trend continues and flips positive, we could see a more intense phase of the rally driven by leveraged traders,” he wrote. Until then, the current environment appears to reflect a market in the process of building a foundation, rather than one that has already entered a euphoric phase. Bitcoin Profit-Taking Remains Measured In another analysis, CryptoQuant’s Enigma Trader examined the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), a key indicator used to evaluate the extent of realized profits by Bitcoin holders. According to the post, SOPR levels have remained moderately above 1 as BTC hit new highs, suggesting that some profit-taking is occurring, but not at a rate that disrupts the broader trend. The analyst observed that a spike in SOPR around July 3–4 coincided with short-term holders taking profits.

Republicans introduced a trio of bills to reshape digital asset policy, only to face sharp pushback from Democrats accusing them of favoring corporate interests over everyday Americans. The proposed legislation , comprising the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, was introduced in the House of Representatives to address data privacy compliance and future digital currency systems. GOP lawmakers argue the bills are crucial to maintaining the US’s competitive edge in financial innovation. However, during a heated Rules Committee hearing on Monday, Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern denounced the initiative as a “crypto giveaway,” slamming it as a misguided effort that ignores the risks of crypto-related corruption. “I have not had one person in my district come up to me and say, ‘please, please Jim, make it easier for crypto millionaires to get richer, please make it easier to con people,’” said McGovern. “Yet that is exactly what is going on here.” The remarks were a direct jab at President Donald Trump’s increased activity in the crypto space, including his family-linked company World Liberty Financial and its associated stablecoin USD1 (and his meme coin, Official Trump). GOP defends innovation push In a rebuttal, Republicans said the bill is meant to future-proof the economy and maintain US competitiveness in a fast-evolving cryptospace. The GOP’s tactics were also a central focus when committee chairman Rep. Virginia Foxx gaveled in the session. Foxx described the GENIUS Act as historic legislation, stating that it would help drive responsible innovation in the United States. She added that Republicans look forward to working with businesses nationwide to fulfill the Act’s promise. The GENIUS Act aims to oversee stablecoins by establishing comprehensive federal standards for issuers. The CLARITY Act addresses deficiencies in digital asset market structure, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act seeks to prohibit a US Central Bank Digital Currency that the government would use, many Republicans fear to surveil private financial activity. Republicans argue that over-regulation should not stymie innovation and financial freedom. They say the bills will advance transparency, offer legal surety, and guard against harm to consumers while also helping to spur growth in the digital economy. Critics, however, argue that the legislation doesn’t do enough to tackle fraud and abuse. McGovern said the bills opened doors to hucksters and market manipulation and were tilted toward rich insiders rather than average investors. Lawmakers struggle to build bipartisan support Republicans face an uphill task despite their enthusiasm. With a narrow majority in the House and no Senate control, the GOP may rely on Democrats to progress the legislation in both chambers. Democrats are not budging easily. Those conflicts of interest, tied to Trump and spread across government, alarmed Representative Maxine Waters and Senator Adam Schiff. Schiff cautioned of “ dangerous entanglements ” between crypto firms and elected officials. Waters noted that many components of the bill aligned with the goals of Trump’s crypto-backed ventures. She emphasized that the American people deserved policies that protected their money, not schemes designed to enrich political allies. Some Democrats also said the legislation diverted the House from urgent matters, like preventing national security threats and addressing economic inequality. And even as crypto comes under greater scrutiny for fraud and instability, most recently in the unraveling of FTX and ongoing enforcement actions by the SEC, some lawmakers are raising questions about whether it’s time to ease up on oversight. The discussion on Monday turned temporarily to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, dramatizing the extent to which the legislative calendar has become infused with tension and pressure. However, Republicans say they are committed to revisiting the crypto package before the August recess, which means they have just under two weeks to do so.

This slowdown may push authorities to introduce new measures to keep growth on track. To date, the globe’s second‑largest economy has avoided a big downturn, supported by a tentative trade agreement with Washington and the buffer of current policy measures. However, the sentiment among investors has turned cautious for the latter half of the year. This is marked by slow exports, persistent price declines and subdued consumer confidence. Forecasts suggest Tuesday’s release at 2 am GMT will reveal 5.1% annual growth in Q2, down from 5.4% in Q1, according to the latest Reuters consensus. “While growth has been resilient year‑to‑date, we still expect it to soften in the second half of the year, due to the payback of front‑loaded exports, ongoing negative deflationary feedback loop, and the impact of tariffs on direct exports to the U.S. and the global trade cycle,”said analysts at Morgan Stanley. They added that “The third‑quarter growth could slow to 4.5 percent or lower, while Q4 faces unfavourable base effect, putting the annual growth target at risk.” Beijing may announce more spending Morgan Stanley anticipates that Beijing may roll out an extra fiscal package ranging from 500 billion to 1 trillion yuan starting towards the end of Q3. June customs figures indicated a rebound in inbound shipments and a modest uptick in exports, driven by a rush to beat an early‑August tariff ceasefire deadline with the United States. Other June metrics on factory activity and consumer spending are forecast to decelerate further. Quarter‑on‑quarter, the Reuters survey predicts GDP will have risen by 0.9% in Q2, after a 1.2% gain in Q1. Furthermore, analysts expect growth to moderate to roughly 4.6% in 2025, falling short of official ambitions, and slip to around 4.2% in 2026. Investors are turning their attention to the late‑July Politburo session, anticipating cues on future policy moves and potential new economic support. According to the survey, experts foresee a 10‑basis‑point reduction in the People’s Bank of China seven‑day reverse repo rate, and a comparable decrease to the loan prime rate, sometime in Q4. Job market makes output cuts risky So far this year, authorities have stepped up public works funding and expanded household subsidy programs, while the central bank in May trimmed borrowing costs and pumped cash into markets to offset trade‑related headwinds. However, experts warn these measures might not be enough to stop the ongoing price drops. June’s producer price index plunged at a rate unseen in roughly two years, underlining persistent deflationary trends. Observers expect officials to step up cuts to excess factory production and look for new ways to encourage domestic spending. Analysts say it’s tricky to cut excess output without triggering major layoffs in a weakening job market. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Surprisingly, while Ethereum continues to dominate headlines, a growing number of savvy investors are shifting focus toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising star in the decentralized lending space that’s quietly gaining traction. The project is priced at $0.03 in the 5th presale phase, which is more than 70% sold. Those who invest in this phase will get a 100% return on investment after listing the token. More than $12.3 million has already been raised, with a total of more than 13,200 early investors. During presale Phase 6, the token will cost $0.035, and that represents 16.67% return on investments made in Phase 5. This could signal a broader shift in investor priorities beyond traditional blue-chip tokens. Ethereum Eyes Fresh Breakout Amid ETF Inflows and Upgrades The good news is that Ethereum (ETH) has recovered its position below the $3,000 level, trading about $2,948 and swinging in between $2,934 and $3,028, having achieved a 6-8 percent upsurge driven by the huge flows of ETFs and tokenization. Individual products at BlackRock, such as the company ETHA trust attracted an all-time high of $300 million in a single day, which adds to a combined $700+ million of flows into ETFs weekly as institutional players show renewed confidence in the DeFi and staking environment at Ethereum. The smart money is still around, but people are gaining more interest in some new DeFi projects, like Mutuum Finance. Presale Milestone: Mutuum Finance Hits $12.3 Million The Mutuum Finance presale has more than 13200 investors and has raised more than $12.3 million. Investors have picked up more than 70% of the tokens in phase 5. This indicates growing confidence of investors in the short-term success of the project as well as in their bright future. Mutuum Finance Launches Massive Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering $100,000 giveaway , divided into 10 winners of 10,000 MUTM tokens. In addition, the top 50 holders of the Mutuum Finance will be rewarded under its newly introduced leaderboard system. As the users level up they will be rewarded the bonus tokens. Transforming DeFi Lending: The Mutuum Finance Approach Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is transforming DeFi lending through the creation of a platform that renders customers the sole owner of their assets. It is a workable multifunctional double-lending system, which incorporates the synergy of both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. In P2C, lending pools are utilized via smart contracts. The platform is sensitive to prevailing market conditions in real time, an aspect that makes returns to lenders less volatile and borrowers financially stable. Through the elimination of intermediaries, the P2P model provides direct lending, which is particularly convenient on highly volatile assets like other coins. Over $12.3 million raised, 13,200+ early investors, and 70% of Phase 5 tokens already gone, Mutuum Finance is clearly gaining momentum as smart money rotates into high-upside DeFi plays. While Ethereum targets a modest move toward $4,000, early MUTM buyers are eyeing a 100% ROI at launch and an even greater upside as uncollateralized lending and dual lending architecture reshape the DeFi narrative. Phase 6 will push the price to $0.035, locking in a 16.67% return for Phase 5 investors. Add in a $100,000 giveaway and a leaderboard rewards system, and the case for Mutuum becomes even stronger.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As bitcoin (BTC) trades near $119,500, having just recently broken through another all-time high of $120,000 , digital asset investment products are also breaking records for inflows – but there's a regional disparity. According to CoinShares, U.S.-listed funds dominated with $3.74 billion in inflows, while Germany saw $85.7 million in outflows, underscoring a growing divergence in global institutional sentiment. This robust institutional appetite in the U.S. is exemplified by Vanguard’s evolving stance on crypto investments. Despite once branding bitcoin as an ""immature asset class,"" the $10 trillion asset manager is now Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy (MSTR)'s largest shareholder, indirectly becoming the most significant Bitcoin holder in traditional finance, as Presto Research recently noted in a d aily markets update. Meanwhile, QCP Capital highlights in a recent note that institutional enthusiasm remains notably robust, exemplified by over $2 billion net inflows into spot BTC ETFs last week. Yet, derivatives markets suggest a more nuanced approach. Leveraged long positions are expanding aggressively, with perpetual funding rates approaching an elevated 30% and open interest surpassing $43 billion, levels unseen since BTC reclaimed $100k in January. Such aggressive positioning raises caution flags, recalling February's abrupt $2 billion liquidation event. “Froth is building,” QCP warns. BTC Continues to Outpace Luxury Watches Bitcoin (BTC) is up 27.87% year-to-date and 13.22% in the past month, easily outperforming the luxury watch market’s modest +4.5% rebound in Q2, according to a recent report co-authored by Morgan Stanley and WatchCharts. Gains were concentrated in flagship models, Daytona, Nautilus, Royal Oak, while brands like Panerai, Breitling, and IWC underperformed. Inventory for watches under $5,000 remains historically elevated, and dealer turnover in that range continues to lag. “Price recovery remains narrow and concentrated,” the report notes, driven by “renewed interest from high-end collectors and improved global risk appetite.” Both BTC and watches, it adds, tend to benefit from “expansionary monetary environments and periods of wealth creation.” But the speculative capital isn’t flowing evenly. Bitcoin has attracted more of the macro-driven bid, with institutional inflows and 24/7 liquidity making it the preferred high-beta asset. The pandemic-era correlation between BTC and watches, both beneficiaries of easy money and speculative excess, broke down in late 2023 with the approval of U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs. BTC has since matured into a macro-sensitive, institutionally backed asset, while watches have returned to their roots: fashion. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin briefly approached $123,000 before cooling off, while crypto-related stocks held modest gains and analysts said the market remains far from euphoric, with one projecting BTC’s $2.5 trillion market cap could eventually converge with gold’s $22 trillion. ETH: ETH surged past $3,079 in early trading on strong volume before retreating in the afternoon to settle near $3,011, forming a textbook breakout-pullback pattern with support holding above the key $3,000 level. Gold: Gold slipped 0.1% after hitting a three-week high amid renewed tariff threats from President Trump and focus on trade talks and U.S. data, while silver surged to its highest level since September 2011. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets opened mixed Tuesday, with investors brushing off President Trump’s tariff shifts and turning attention to upcoming Chinese economic data, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 remained flat. S&P 500: RBC Capital Markets raised its 2025 S&P 500 target to 6,250 from 5,730, but unlike Goldman and BofA, it expects little upside from current levels, with the index already above 6,280 as of July 11.

Overall retail sales rose 3.1% compared with a year ago, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said. The upturn was largely the result of warmer weather, which had prompted Britons to spend more on electric fans, sports, and leisure equipment. The bright weather also moved consumers out of doors, increasing spending on seasonal goods . The BRC’s Chief Executive, Helen Dickinson, said that food and non-food performances were good. “Retail sales heated up in June, with both food and non-food performing well,” she said. “Food sales remained strong, though this was partly driven by food inflation, which has risen steadily over the year.” Food sales alone rose 4.1% while non-food purchases rose 2.2%, overturning the retail sector’s drag on gross domestic product in May. Economic uncertainty and increased cost of living have made consumers tighten their belts this month. Businesses regain confidence The increase in retail spending is the latest in a series of indicators that point to the possibility that the UK economy is recovering after a weak spring. The economy shrank in April and May, the first consecutive contraction in economywide activity since 2009, as the country reeled from a combination of domestic and international forces, ranging from newly imposed tariffs by the United States to a hike in corporate taxes, and a national minimum wage that was raised that prompted businesses to pare back hiring and payroll costs. But the climate for business is improving. A purchasing managers’ index (PMI) published earlier this month indicated that private sector activity expanded quickly by nine months in June. That is for all of manufacturing and services. At the same time, a recent Bank of England survey showed that companies are ready to start taking on new staff again, which is good news for employment and consumer spending in the future. The survey found that companies planned to add to payrolls in the next 12 months by 1.1%, a sharp rebound compared to how cautiously the nation’s businesses began the year. Research fellow Paul Dales said in a note to investors that there was evidence to suggest the worst of the economic downturn had passed and that conditions were likely to improve. He added that although the recovery remained tentative, recent data indicated that confidence was returning in key sectors of the economy. Starmer leverages retail bounce for political relief The brighter economic horizon could not have come at a better time for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has been under pressure to produce results soon after assuming office . His administration has its hands full: from cost-of-living complaints to low productivity and slow growth. The recovery in retail sales, rising business confidence, and better labor market expectations offer a respite. It could give his administration the political room it requires to launch new reforms and investment plans without overshadowing a worsening recession. However, caution still abounds; amid ongoing global uncertainty, rising food prices, and potential interest rate changes from the Bank of England, economists said the trend indicates the UK could miss a prolonged recession. For Starmer, it may represent a narrow window of opportunity to cement public backing and stabilize the economy. Should these green shoots continue to flourish during the remainder of the summer and into the autumn, the UK could end 2025 with a stronger base for its economy than many dared to believe possible earlier this year.

According to on-chain data from Artemis and deBridge, more than $125 million worth of assets have been bridged into Solana from other blockchains in the last seven days. REPORT: In the last 7 days, over $125 million bridged from other chains to @Solana , including $70 million+ from Ethereum alone. (A growth of nearly 40% compared to last week) pic.twitter.com/jMVTiJZ8jr — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) July 14, 2025 Ethereum Fuels $70M Liquidity Wave Into Solana as Meme Coin Hype Cools Solana is experiencing a major liquidity revival, driven primarily by Ethereum, as the volume of bridged assets surges. According to data from Artemis, Ethereum accounted for over $70 million in inflows into Solana, representing nearly 56% of the total. Arbitrum followed with $14.1 million, while Polygon and BNB Chain contributed $7.5 million and $2.6 million, respectively. Other smaller chains made up the remaining $4.2 million. The total bridged volume into Solana rose by almost 40% week-over-week, with the Ethereum-to-Solana route emerging as the most dominant pipeline. Data from deBridge further confirms that $31 million in assets flowed from Ethereum to Solana alone. Source: solscan Much of this capital shift appears linked to a cooling off in the once-explosive meme coin launching frenzy. While Solana had previously seen a massive surge in new token launches, last week saw only 322,000 new token launches, a sharp slowdown compared to earlier peaks. This trend indicates a move back toward established projects and tokens. Interestingly, even during the heated rivalry between LetsBONK and Pump.fun, token activity remained relatively muted. LetsBONK graduated 1,243 tokens, double Pump.fun’s 622, and also launched 130,605 new tokens, significantly ahead of Pump.fun’s 77,250. Amid a slowdown in new meme coin launches, several older and more established Solana-based meme tokens are seeing renewed interest. Traders appear to be redirecting liquidity toward more recognizable assets, including Pepe ( PEPE ), Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Bonk ( BONK ), and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) , signaling a shift from novelty to familiarity. Source: Cryptonews PEPE has recorded a notable 23.73% increase in market capitalization over the past seven days and is now trading at $0.00001217. The token’s 24-hour trading volume stands at $5.87 billion, up 78.50% from the previous day. This surge in volume reflects a spike in market activity. As of today, PEPE’s market capitalization is $5.12 billion. Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), the second-largest meme token by market value, is also gaining traction. The token is currently trading at $0.00001329, up 14.9% over the past week and 0.6% in the last 24 hours. SHIB’s market capitalization is now $7.83 billion, ranking it 23rd in token market cap. Dogecoin ( DOGE ), the largest meme coin by market cap, is currently trading at $0.1982. It has risen 18.5% over the past seven days, reaching over $8.06 billion in market cap. Bonk ( BONK ) has captured significant market attention, with its price climbing 70% over the last 10 trading sessions. The token is currently priced at $0.00002719, reflecting a 6.27% increase in the past 24 hours. BONK’s market cap has climbed to $1.465 billion after gaining 33.9% in the past week. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) has also experienced a sharp resurgence. The token jumped 48.2% in the last seven days, lifting its market capitalization to $1.918 billion. The sudden momentum was amplified by a surprise social media endorsement from TRON founder Justin Sun, further fueling investor interest. Together, these developments point to a broader trend of capital rotation back into familiar meme coins, as traders seek stability and momentum within the increasingly saturated meme token market. Solana Tops Q2 Revenue at $271M, Outpaces Ethereum, Bitcoin & Tron Meanwhile, Solana itself continues to outshine its peers in core metrics. The blockchain generated over $271 million in revenue in Q2 2025, outpacing Ethereum, Tron, and Bitcoin for the third consecutive quarter, according to Blockworks.

Active addresses rose to 24.4 million, and fee revenue increased 44% to $7.68 million. Adding to the momentum is the anticipation around Solana ETFs. Polymarket data shows that traders now estimate a 99% chance that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot Solana ETF by the end of 2025. Bloomberg ETF analysts have sharply raised expectations for US approval of spot funds tracking Solana, Litecoin, and XRP. #ETFs #XRP https://t.co/dKK2ZIbW8c — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 1, 2025 Several major firms, including VanEck, Grayscale, 21Shares, and Bitwise, have already filed applications, signaling deep institutional interest. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart echoed the sentiment, saying , “We’re expecting a wave of new ETFs in the second half of the year. Solana is clearly leading that conversation.” Notably, Solana ( SOL ) is currently trading at $162.19, up 9.5% over the past 7 days. The token has also seen a sharp rise in trading activity, with 24-hour volume hitting $14.4 billion, a 133.4% increase from the previous day. Source: Cryptonews On July 12, analyst Ali Martinez shared a bullish outlook on Solana, highlighting a cup-and-handle pattern forming on the weekly chart, a classic bullish signal that often precedes major rallies. This is a critical level for Solana $SOL . A weekly close above $170 could ignite the next major bull run and open the gates to $2,000! pic.twitter.com/JjTaRdUL4h — Ali (@ali_charts) July 12, 2025 The pattern suggests that Solana has recovered from its past lows near $9.88, following a multi-year climb from its previous peak around $250. The recent price action appears to be forming the “handle” portion of the structure. Martinez points to $170 as a critical resistance level. A confirmed breakout above this level, particularly with a weekly close, could validate the pattern and trigger a strong upward move. Based on Fibonacci projections, potential price targets include $295 (a retest of the all-time high), with longer-term targets of $787, $1,314, and even $2,744. However, failure to break past $170 may lead to a pullback toward $135 or even $100, which has historically acted as strong support.

According to data from sources, Coinbase’s stock ended up 1.8% at $394.01 per share on the day. At the same time, shares hit a peak of $398.50. At today’s closing price, Coinbase has a market cap of nearly $100.36 billion, the highest market cap the crypto exchange has recorded in history. Bitwise CIO anticipates Coinbase becoming a trillion-dollar company at some point Coinbase shares have popped 50% in the past month alone in conjunction with the highly successful initial public offering (IPO) of Circle Internet Group and favorable regulatory changes in the United States. The crypto exchange also encountered a significant achievement on May 19 after adding it to the S&P 500 index. This milestone distinguishes Coinbase as the first cryptocurrency-focused company to gain entry into this benchmark, highlighting its growing legitimacy within the financial sector. This month, Coinbase experienced a steady increase in revenue that did not come from transactions in the last year, totaling $772 million in the first three months, according to analysis from sources. Last week, the company brought on a user named AlexOnchain to help increase its social media presence. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan had previously forecasted Coinbase’s significant milestone. Based on his anticipation, the firm could eventually become a trillion-dollar company. On May 13, in an X Post , Hougan advised investors to choose a company currently worth less than $100 billion but has the best chance of reaching a value of over $1 trillion . He gave Coinbase as an example, which is valued at $61 billion. Coinbase’s stock rebounds amid growing adoption of cryptocurrencies On June 26, Coinbase’s shares had also experienced a surge, closing at a record high in a rally that increased the embrace of cryptocurrencies on Wall Street and Washington. This came after the stock of the crypto exchange operator jumped 5.5% to $375.07. That surpasses the previous peak of $357.39 in November 2021, only a few months after the company became public with a direct listing. Notably, Coinbase shares have soared more than 1,000% from a record low in late 2022, when the failure of FTX had cast further doubt on the digital asset’s future. The stock’s rebound came as cryptocurrency prices recovered, and the industry itself secured powerful new allies, including President Trump, a strong crypto supporter who has embraced crypto stances in the US. Another important milestone that contributed to the crypto exchange’s share surge was after the US Senate approved legislation for stablecoins pegged to the dollar, which are considered a promising payment method. Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer highlighted the significance of stablecoins in the company’s operations. According to him, revenues generated from stablecoins will probably enable the company to reduce its dependence on trading revenue, which is under pressure from competition. Following trade analysis, Coinbase’s main source of revenue has emerged from stablecoins. Therefore, with these new regulations, the crypto exchange will achieve financial stability and continuous success. Republican House leaders are preparing to pass a stablecoin regulatory bill this week, aiming to send Congress’s first major piece of digital asset legislation to the president’s desk. The vote marks the beginning of what supporters are calling “Crypto Week” — a series of decisions that could reshape the crypto landscape in the US. The proposed legislation, backed by industry leaders, is expected to bolster the adoption of dollar-based stablecoins. If passed, it would represent a significant win for crypto proponents, who collectively invested hundreds of millions of dollars during the last election cycle to help install lawmakers favorable to digital asset innovation, according to Federal Election Commission data. “The golden age of digital assets is here,” said Rep. Bryan Steil (R-WI), a key industry ally and chair of the House crypto subcommittee. President Donald Trump, now prioritizing digital asset regulation in his second term, has vowed to make the United States the “crypto capital” of the world. His family’s involvement in crypto ventures — which has reportedly earned them hundreds of millions of dollars — has drawn criticism from Democrats, some of whom have pushed, unsuccessfully, to include prohibitions targeting Trump-affiliated crypto businesses in the legislation. The House is also set to vote this week on two additional industry-supported bills: one to establish comprehensive market structure rules for cryptocurrencies, and another to block the Federal Reserve from launching a digital currency.

Crypto Capital Inflows Are Currently Sitting At $51 Billion As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, there is a stark difference in capital participation between the current Bitcoin rally and the one from December 2024. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $118,000—But Liquidity Still Thin, Glassnode Warns Below is the chart shared by the analyst that compares the two bull runs. The graph captures the 30-day capital flows occurring for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the stablecoins. For the former two assets, it tracks them using the Realized Cap indicator. The Realized Cap is a capitalization model that calculates a given cryptocurrency’s total value by assuming that each coin in the circulating supply has its value equal to the last time it changed hands on the network. In short, what the metric represents is the amount of capital that investors of the asset as a whole have put into it. Changes in this indicator, therefore, correspond to the entry or exit of capital into the network. As is visible in the chart, the 30-day Realized Cap change for Bitcoin and Ethereum (colored in orange) has gone up alongside the latest price rally, indicating that capital has flowed into these coins. It’s also apparent that stablecoin flows (blue) have also noted an uptick, although the scale has been smaller. For stables, capital flow can be directly measured using the market cap, since their price is always pegged to $1 means that the Realized Cap never differs from the market cap. In the cryptocurrency sector, capital mainly comes in through three entry points: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins. The altcoins usually only receive a rotation of capital from these assets. Since the flows related to the three have recently been positive, the market as a whole has been getting an injection of capital. In total, the aggregate capital inflows for the cryptocurrency sector have stood at $51.2 billion for the past month. This is certainly a sizeable figure on its own, but it pales in comparison to what was witnessed before. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Breaks 8-Year Resistance Line That Failed In 2017-2021 As Martinez has highlighted in the chart, the monthly capital flows peaked at almost $135 billion in the December 2024 Bitcoin rally above $100,000, more than double the latest number. Something to keep in mind, however, is the fact that the previous run was more explosive, while the latest one has come in two waves: an initial recovery surge above $100,000 that led into a consolidation phase and the current breakout into the $120,000 levels. This could, at least in part, explain why the metric has appeared relatively cool recently. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $121,700, up nearly 3% over the last 24 hours.

Dolce & Gabbana USA Was Not Behind Failed NFT Project According to a July 11 ruling from Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald of the Southern District of New York, Dolce & Gabbana USA Inc. is cleared from the high-profile litigation as it is not an “alter ego” of its parent company, Dolce & Gabbana SRL, which was in charge of the NFT-focused “DGFamily” project. “The Court finds that plaintiff has not adequately alleged that D&G S.R.L. completely dominated D&G USA even if D&G S.R.L. allegedly shared some employees and office space with D&G USA,” the filing states in part. “For the foregoing reasons, D&G USA’s motion is granted,” Reice concludes. DGFamily NFT Project Slammed As Rug Pull In Lawsuit Filed in May and amended in September 2024 , the lawsuit alleges that Dolce & Gabbana US and its Italian counterpart abandoned the “DGFamily” NFT project and failed to deliver on the mission’s promises while retaining customer funds. According to the Dolce & Gabbana website, “DGFamily” supposedly provided access to exclusive drops and collaborations, digital wearables, physical products, and events hosted by the company. However, the litigation implies that the iconic fashion house’s digital asset venture was nothing more than a classic “rug pull.” 1/ Dolce&Gabbana and @UNXD_NFT announce the highly anticipated launch of the DGFamily community. 3 distinct Boxes + digital, physical, & experiential benefits that take holders on a journey between real life & the metaverse. https://t.co/JMmmWZuRPu https://t.co/sCWuIQSwnD pic.twitter.com/r5t0M3FfBs — Dolce & Gabbana (@dolcegabbana) February 21, 2022 “Each of Defendants’ misrepresentations and omissions were material because they were designed to, and did, entice the public into purchasing unregistered securities (DGFamily Products) which were barely more than a vehicle for the Defendants’ enrichment,” the lawsuit reads. “Either through reckless incompetence or greed, Defendants failed to deliver what they promised in exchange for purchasing their digital assets and abandoned their crypto project while retaining over $25 million used to fund the project,” it continues.

In a statement on its website, the California‑based maker of AI hardware stated that it has already applied to the US Commerce Department for the needed licenses to continue H20 shipments. Management expects approval “soon,” and said deliveries to Chinese buyers will follow quickly once the paperwork is complete. Alongside the resumption plan, Nvidia introduced an RTX Pro graphics processor that it calls “fully compliant” with current regulations. The chip is aimed at digital‑twin artificial‑intelligence work in smart factories, logistics hubs, and other industrial settings inside China. Chief Executive Jensen Huang has been trying to keep doors open in both Washington and Beijing. The company noted that Huang recently met Trump and several lawmakers in the capital before traveling to China for talks with officials there. The meetings, Nvidia said, were meant to promote cooperation on AI research and to underline the firm’s open‑source support. Hints of a scaled‑down H20 for China first surfaced in May. Nvidia had been preparing a scaled-down version to satisfy US export curbs on advanced semiconductors and chips. Those curbs had blocked the original H20 from being shipped to Beijing.. Nvidia had previously lost access to $50 billion China market During Nvidia’s last earnings call, Huang painted a bleak picture of the impact of US curbs on its shipments. “The fifty‑billion‑dollar China market is effectively closed to U.S. industry,” he told analysts. “As a result, we are taking a multibillion‑dollar writeoff on inventory that cannot be sold or repurposed.” The pressure intensified in April. According to Nvidia, the government informed the firm that even the H20 chip’s export would be limited. The decision halted sales at once, leaving no time for the company to clear back orders. U.S. officials pointed to concerns over national security over highly capable AI chips reaching a major geopolitical rival. Nvidia had created the H20 in response to earlier restrictions imposed in 2022 under President Joe Biden. That initial round barred the export of the company’s fastest AI accelerators to China. The H20 is a scaled-down design meant to stay within the allowed performance ceiling. Huang is not worried about China’s military using US tech The CEO returned to the theme in a recent CNN interview that aired Sunday, shortly before another planned trip to China. Huang sought to ease fears that Nvidia hardware might boost Chinese military projects. Huang mentioned that the US need not be concerned about the People’s Liberation Army using US tech because “they simply can’t rely on it.” He added that Washington could cut off access whenever it wants and pointed out that China already has enough computing power. Huang added, “They don’t need Nvidia’s chips, certainly, or American tech stacks in order to build their military.” His remarks come after years of measures in the Congress and the White House to curb shipments of advanced AI chips to Chinese customers. Huang again criticized that strategy, calling it counterproductive to America’s goal of maintaining leadership in cutting‑edge tech. “We want the American tech stack to be the global standard,” he told CNN. “In order for us to do that, we have to be in search of all the AI developers in the world.” He noted that about half of those developers are based in China.

A close above the $122,000 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $123,200 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $125,000 level. The main target could be $130,000. Downside Correction In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $120,500 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Immediate support is near the $117,500 level. The first major support is near the $115,800 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $108,636 swing low to the $123,140 high. The next support is now near the $114,000 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $112,500 support in the near term. The main support sits at $110,500, below which BTC might continue to move down. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $117,500, followed by $115,800.

However, exchange data shows a sharp increase in BTC inflows following this milestone, raising concerns of a potential short-term correction. Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Warn Of Pullback According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Tarekonchain, BTC is beginning to show signs of short-term cooling. Notably, exchange inflows recorded a sharp uptick right after Bitcoin hit its fresh ATH. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Ahead? DXY Breakdown Suggests Capital Shift To Risk-On Assets The following chart shared by the analyst highlights exchange netflows to spot platforms, with notable spikes in inflows to centralized exchanges. This typically indicates profit-taking behavior by short-term holders and some whales. Tarekonchain noted that such on-chain activity is usually indicative of a local top that could lead to a healthy price correction or consolidation in the coming days. They added: It’s a classic pattern we’ve seen after previous parabolic rallies – profits are realized, weak hands exit, and price finds a new base. That said, the analyst noted that despite the warning signs of a looming price correction, the overall market structure remains largely bullish. For instance, long-term holders are still holding their BTC, not keen on selling at current price levels. Supporting the bullish thesis, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continue to attract strong capital. For the week ending July 11, they saw $2.72 billion in net inflows – a clear sign of ongoing institutional interest. Whales Preparing To Sell? In a separate post, CryptoQuant contributor Crazzyblockk pointed to an uptick in whale activity on Binance. The Binance Whale Activity Score shows that deposits from large wallets have spiked dramatically. Related Reading: Bitcoin Uptrend Intact, But Binance Activity Warns Of Short-Term Pullback Whales reportedly deposited as much as 1,800 BTC to Binance in a single day, with more than 35% of transactions valued at over $1 million, hinting at strategic positioning ahead of expected volatility. Crazzyblockk highlighted two possible scenarios following the surge in deposits from large-scale investors. First, it is likely that these investors are sitting on healthy profits and may be getting ready to secure some gains after a historic run. Alternatively, they might be aiming to leverage Binance’s deep liquidity to hedge or open new positions as the market experiences heightened volatility. Either way, this sell-side pressure on Binance is likely to weigh on BTC’s bullish momentum. Despite rising inflows and increased whale activity, market sentiment remains broadly positive. Retail investor participation is still muted compared to previous bull runs, suggesting the current rally might still have room to grow. At press time, BTC trades at $119,449, up 0.8% in the past 24 hours.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $11.14. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $27.9 and $33.66, with an average value of $28.88. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2025 – 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.6384 Market Cap $1.11B Trading Volume $296.99M Circulating Supply 1.75B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.4005 (Jun 18, 2022) 24-hour High $0.6986 24-hour Low $0.6351 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 7.75% 50-Day SMA $0.6242 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 73 (Greed) Green Days 17/30 (57%) 200-Day SMA $0.9977 Optimism price analysis: TL;DR Breakdown: The daily chart shows a bearish breakdown below $0.640 support with a potential test of $0.560 zone. The critical resistance at $0.670 must be reclaimed to restore bullish momentum toward $0.720. Optimism 1-day price chart: OP faces rejection at $0.7 The OP/USDT daily chart for July 15 reveals a clear rejection from the $0.707 resistance level established a few days back, with subsequent selling pressure creating a lower high pattern that threatens the recent recovery narrative. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD indicator at 0.014 remains marginally positive but shows weakening momentum as the histogram bars compress, suggesting diminishing bullish conviction. The current close below $0.640 opens the door for a test of the $0.580-$0.560 support zone where previous consolidation occurred. Optimism 4-hour price chart: OP remains within a tight range The 4-hour signifies reduced volatility that typically precedes significant price movements. The upper Bollinger Band at $0.687 has been acting as dynamic resistance while the lower band at $0.631 provides immediate support, creating a narrow trading range that’s compressing further. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Volume patterns show the recent selling wave peaked around 180M but has since declined to 149.47M, suggesting exhaustion in the current bearish move. The price structure reveals a series of lower highs from the July 12th peak at $0.700, but the lack of decisive volume on the downside moves indicates this could be consolidation rather than the start of a major correction. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.6543 SELL SMA 5 $0.6870 SELL SMA 10 $0.6317 BUY SMA 21 $0.6029 BUY SMA 50 $0.6242 BUY SMA 100 $0.6868 SELL SMA 200 $0.9977 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.5952 BUY EMA 5 $0.6096 BUY EMA 10 $0.6416 SELL EMA 21 $0.6953 SELL EMA 50 $0.8368 SELL EMA 100 $1.0696 SELL EMA 200 $1.3624 SELL What to expect from Optimism? OP is at a make-or-break moment. If it can’t bounce back above $0.67, we’re likely heading down to $0.56. But if buyers step in and push it back above that level, we could see a solid push towards $0.72-$0.75. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up to $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

Optimism historic price sentiment Optimism price history by Coingecko OP launched with an initial value of $4.57 on May 31 but dropped sharply in June due to the UST stablecoin de-pegging and LUNA collapse, closing June at $0.5434. It further declined to $0.4147 by mid-July. In August, OP briefly surged above $1.90, but by mid-October, it dropped to $0.70 following the FTX collapse. In Q1 2023, OP surged past $3.00 during a crypto bull run but lost 66% shortly after. A recovery saw it close the year at $3.90. OP saw an eventful 2024, reaching an all-time high of $4.85 in March before sliding below $2.30 by mid-April. After a brief recovery to over $2.90 in May, it entered a bearish phase, trading at $1.82–$1.96 by July and $1.54–$1.62 by October. November brought a spark of hope with a peak at $2.60. OP closed December within the range of $1.611–$2.773. In January 2025, OP peaked at $2.18 but lost momentum, dropping to as low as $0.84 in February.

ETH is now consolidating gains and might correct lower toward the $2,900 zone. Ethereum started a fresh increase above the $3,000 level. The price is trading near $2,940 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2,980 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it remains supported above the $2,900 zone in the near term. Ethereum Price Rallies Above $3,000 Ethereum price started a fresh increase above the $2,800 zone, like Bitcoin . ETH price gained pace for a move above the $2,880 resistance zone and entered a positive zone. The bulls even pumped the price above $2,920. Finally, it tested the $3,080 zone. A high was formed at $3,081 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,905 swing low to the $3,081 high. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2,980 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading near $2,940 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $2,980 level. The next key resistance is near the $3,000 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,040 level. A clear move above the $3,040 resistance might send the price toward the $3,080 resistance. An upside break above the $3,080 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,200 resistance zone or even $3,220 in the near term. Are Downsides Supported In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,000 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,940 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,905 swing low to the $3,081 high.

July 10th registered the third-largest single-day inflow ever. This marks the 13th week in a row of inflows, raising the cumulative total to $21.8 billion, with year-to-date inflows hitting $22.7 billion. Assets under management surpassed the $200 billion milestone for the first time, reaching a record $211 billion. ETP trading volumes also surged to $29 billion, doubling the year’s typical weekly average. Investors Pour Billions into Bitcoin and Ethereum In the latest edition of the ‘Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report,’ CoinShares revealed Bitcoin investment products recorded $2.7 billion in inflows last week, which pushed the total assets under management (AuM) to $179.5 billion. Interestingly, this means Bitcoin now represents 54% of the AuM held in gold ETPs for the first time. Short Bitcoin ETPs remained quiet with minor inflows of $0.4 million. Ethereum extended its streak with a 12th consecutive week of inflows as it amassed $990 million, its fourth-largest on record. In relative terms, Ethereum’s inflows over 12 weeks equate to 19.5% of its AuM, thereby outperforming Bitcoin’s 9.8%. Solana followed with a strong $92.6 million in inflows, while Sui attracted $3.5 million. During the same period, multi-asset investment products saw $1.1 million in new capital, and Cardano pulled in $0.5 million. On the other hand, XRP led outflows with $104 million, while Chainlink noted $0.5 million in outflows. Regional flows showed the United States in a clear lead with $3.7 billion in inflows, while Switzerland and Canada posted $65.8 million and $17.1 million, respectively. Australia’s inflows stood at $1 million. Germany recorded the week’s largest outflows with $85.7 million. Sweden and Brazil followed with $15.7 million and $7.5 million in outflows. These strong inflows into digital assets have coincided with Bitcoin’s breakout. No Signs of Fatigue? According to QCP Capital, Bitcoin’s rally above $122,000 shows no signs of slowing. In an update, the firm noted that the market underestimated the strength of this parabolic breakout. A decisive technical move and rising institutional demand are driving the surge. To top that, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index jumped from 40 to 70 in three weeks. This signals a clear transition from fear to greed among investors. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw over $2 billion in net inflows last week, which is indicative of a growing institutional participation in the rally. Perpetual funding rates are also nearing 30% as leveraged long positions build while total open interest has crossed $43 billion, levels last seen in January. Despite the rally, implied volatility has not spiked as it usually does. Front-end implied vols rose but remain below last year’s average levels. One-month risk reversals are also flat, which points to little demand for immediate upside. However, September and December risk reversals show strong bids for calls, meaning investors are hedging long-term upside while managing near-term caution. Elevated funding rates also call for careful positioning amid market euphoria. QCP said that it remains structurally bullish on Bitcoin with macro and institutional support. However, it prefers positioning on a pullback rather than chasing the current rally.

According to him, cryptocurrencies like XRP and Ethereum could soon hold a bigger share of the market, especially in terms of assets managed through ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds). Currently, Bitcoin leads with around 5.6% of market share in ETFs, while Ethereum sits at about 3%. McClurg said it’s possible for XRP and ETH to reach around 6% in the future as more people start understanding how these assets work as financial tools. While Ripple, the company behind XRP, faced legal challenges over the years, it built strong partnerships worldwide. He said that Ripple is now well-positioned to compete with traditional financial systems like Fedwire, something that didn’t seem possible a few years ago. On the topic of investments, McClurg said that some investors will prefer ETFs for their simplicity and transparency, while others might go for companies holding cryptocurrencies like XRP as part of their treasury. He expects a mix of both, with some people choosing to invest directly in crypto-backed ETFs, while others might opt for companies managing digital assets. Overall, McClurg believes Ripple is one of the strongest contenders in the race to modernize financial transactions, and XRP could play a big role in this growing market. When asked about altcoin season, he added that while Bitcoin is expected to climb towards $140,000, some altcoins will follow, though not all will reach new highs. “I don’t see Solana or Ethereum breaking new all-time highs this year,” McClurg said. Instead, he said that newer tokens like SUI, Injective, and Axelar have a better chance of hitting fresh records. As for XRP, McClurg said its price movement will likely depend on ongoing legal and regulatory developments, but he does expect it to hit a new high for this year, even if not an all-time record.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,MARKET|XRP|ETH|REGULATION|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-15 04:20:01

Recently, DWF Labs , a major Web3 venture capital firm and market maker, received an astonishing 2.5 billion PUMP tokens. This colossal transfer, valued at approximately $17.4 million, originated from Pump.fun, the platform behind the token itself. This development has ignited widespread speculation, particularly regarding DWF Labs’ potential role as an early investor in the project. DWF Labs’ Strategic Move: What Does This PUMP Token Acquisition Mean? When a firm like DWF Labs makes such a substantial move, the crypto community takes notice. Known for its aggressive and strategic investments across various blockchain projects, DWF Labs often plays a pivotal role in the liquidity and market dynamics of the assets they touch. The receipt of 2.5 billion PUMP tokens from Pump.fun is not just a mere transaction; it’s a potential signal of deeper involvement and confidence in the project’s future. Here’s why this acquisition is particularly noteworthy: Scale of Acquisition: 2.5 billion tokens represent a significant portion, indicating a major stake. Direct Transfer from Source: The tokens came directly from Pump.fun, not through an open market purchase, which lends credence to the early investor theory. Market Impact: DWF Labs’ involvement can often bring increased visibility and liquidity to a token, potentially influencing its price trajectory. This event underscores DWF Labs’ continued influence in shaping the landscape of new and emerging crypto assets. Understanding the PUMP Token: A Closer Look at Its Market Debut The PUMP token is intrinsically linked to Pump.fun, a platform that has gained attention for its unique approach to token creation and distribution. Unlike traditional launches, Pump.fun allows users to create and launch their own tokens with minimal effort, often fostering a highly speculative and community-driven environment. The PUMP token itself serves as the native asset within this ecosystem, likely playing a role in governance, fees, or staking on the platform. The token recently made its debut on major exchanges, including Gate.io, where it is currently trading at approximately $0.005517. This listing provides broader accessibility for investors and marks a crucial step in the token’s journey towards wider adoption. The market’s reaction to the PUMP token’s listing and its subsequent price movements will be closely watched, especially now with DWF Labs’ visible involvement. Pump.fun’s Early Investors: Is DWF Labs Among Them? The speculation that DWF Labs might be one of Pump.fun ’s early investors stems from the nature and timing of the token transfer. Blockchain analytics platform LookOnChain, renowned for its on-chain sleuthing, first reported this transaction via X, highlighting the direct nature of the transfer from Pump.fun to DWF Labs. This type of direct allocation often signifies a pre-listing agreement or an early investment round. Being an early investor carries several implications: Favorable Terms: Early investors typically receive tokens at a much lower price, offering substantial upside potential. Strategic Partnership: It suggests a deeper strategic relationship between DWF Labs and Pump.fun, beyond just market making. Long-Term Commitment: A large early stake indicates a belief in the long-term viability and growth of the Pump.fun ecosystem. While official confirmation is awaited, the on-chain data strongly supports this hypothesis, painting a picture of a well-orchestrated strategic alliance. Navigating Crypto Investment: Insights from This Significant Token Transfer This event offers valuable lessons for anyone involved in crypto investment . The actions of major players like DWF Labs often provide insights into market trends, potential growth areas, and the dynamics of token distribution. For retail investors, understanding these large-scale movements can be crucial for informed decision-making. Key takeaways for investors: Follow On-Chain Data: Platforms like LookOnChain offer transparency into large transactions, revealing potential insider moves or strategic partnerships. Research Investor Profiles: Knowing which major firms are backing a project can be a strong indicator of its perceived value and potential. Understand Tokenomics: Grasping how a token is distributed, its utility, and its market cap helps in assessing its true value. While the allure of quick gains is strong, strategic crypto investment requires diligent research and an understanding of the underlying market mechanics. The Power of Blockchain Analytics: Uncovering Market Signals The very fact that this significant transfer came to light is a testament to the power of blockchain analytics . Platforms like LookOnChain tirelessly monitor public blockchain ledgers, identifying and reporting on large or unusual transactions. This transparency is a cornerstone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) world, allowing anyone with the right tools to trace the flow of assets. How blockchain analytics helps: Transparency: All transactions are recorded and immutable, allowing for public scrutiny. Early Warning System: Unusual transfers or wallet movements can signal upcoming events, such as listings, liquidations, or major investments. Market Intelligence: Analysts can derive valuable insights into whale behavior, institutional activity, and overall market sentiment. For both seasoned traders and curious enthusiasts, blockchain analytics serves as an indispensable tool for understanding the true pulse of the crypto market. Conclusion: A New Chapter for PUMP Token? The acquisition of 2.5 billion PUMP tokens by DWF Labs marks a significant milestone for both the token and the Pump.fun platform. Whether as an early investor or a strategic partner, DWF Labs’ involvement is likely to bring increased attention, potential liquidity, and perhaps even further development opportunities to the PUMP token ecosystem. This event highlights the intricate dance between emerging platforms and established crypto heavyweights, continually shaping the volatile yet exciting world of digital assets. As the PUMP token continues its journey on exchanges like Gate.io, the crypto community will be keenly watching how this massive acquisition influences its trajectory and the broader market.

The move has added more than 10% to its value over the past week, pushing the global cryptocurrency market valuation above $3.87 trillion, inching toward the $4 trillion mark. The current rally has reignited discussions around volume dynamics and accumulation patterns, as analysts monitor potential early signals that may influence near-term market behavior. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Reach $135,000 By September’s Close, Standard Chartered Forecasts Two contributors to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, BorisVest and Darkfost, have highlighted technical patterns that emerged before and during Bitcoin’s latest breakout. Their analyses suggest a combination of shrinking spot volume and surging accumulation activity may have played a role in driving prices higher. These insights provide a more nuanced view of the forces behind Bitcoin’s recent surge, particularly at a time when market participants weigh upside potential against the possibility of volatility in uncharted price zones. Volume Drop on Binance Preceded Breakout, Analyst Says According to BorisVest, a notable collapse in spot trading volume on Binance preceded Bitcoin’s move out of the $100,000 to $110,000 consolidation range. In his post titled “Binance Spot Volume Collapsed Before Bitcoin’s Breakout: Was It a Hidden Squeeze Signal?”, he explained that declining spot volumes often represent quiet periods of either accumulation or distribution. Binance, due to its liquidity depth and user base, is seen as a reliable proxy for broader crypto market behavior. BorisVest noted that once the breakout began, trading volume spiked sharply. While such spikes can indicate local tops or bottoms, in this case, the surge in volume did not trigger a reversal but instead accelerated the rally. “That’s a strong signal. If the move had no real backing, we would have seen a fast pullback. Instead, Bitcoin kept pushing higher,” he wrote. He emphasized that volume acts as a roadmap for identifying zones of trade concentration and potential shifts in sentiment, cautioning that while Bitcoin’s recent move appears structurally strong, market participants should be aware of the risks tied to high volatility zones. Accumulator Addresses Hit 2025 High Amid Price Surge In a separate update, CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost observed that Bitcoin “accumulator addresses,” wallets with a history of only buying and not selling BTC, have collectively acquired roughly 248,000 BTC in 2025 so far. This is well above the monthly average of 164,000 BTC, pointing to intensified buying activity in recent weeks. “These addresses have no history of distribution and their continued activity at current price levels indicates long-term positioning,” he said. Darkfost also cautioned that if Bitcoin enters a correction or consolidation phase, some of these wallets could begin selling, which would disqualify them as accumulators and potentially introduce significant selling pressure.

A recent announcement that has sent ripples through the digital asset world is the strategic move by global crypto exchange OKX to join Paxos’ Global Dollar Network . This collaboration marks a pivotal moment for the adoption and utility of the USDG stablecoin , promising enhanced liquidity and broader access for users worldwide. It underscores a growing trend of established financial players and innovative crypto platforms coming together to build a more robust and interconnected digital economy. Understanding Paxos’ Global Dollar Network: A Foundation for Digital Trust At its core, Paxos’ Global Dollar Network is an ambitious initiative designed to facilitate the instant, frictionless movement of digital assets, primarily stablecoins, across a global ecosystem. Think of it as a superhighway for digital dollars, enabling seamless transactions between financial institutions, businesses, and individuals. Paxos, a regulated blockchain infrastructure platform, has meticulously built this network with a focus on compliance, security, and efficiency. Regulated Framework: Paxos operates under stringent regulatory oversight, which provides a crucial layer of trust and stability, distinguishing its offerings from many other crypto projects. This regulatory clarity is vital for attracting institutional participants. Interoperability: The network aims to connect various financial systems, exchanges, and payment providers, fostering greater interoperability within the digital asset space. This means easier transfers and settlements across different platforms. Efficiency in Settlement: By leveraging blockchain technology, the Global Dollar Network can significantly reduce settlement times from days to mere seconds, leading to substantial cost savings and operational efficiencies for participants. Scalability: Designed to handle high volumes of transactions, the network is built to scale with the increasing demand for digital dollar settlements, ensuring its long-term viability and utility. The vision behind the Global Dollar Network is to create a truly global, real-time settlement system for digital currencies, fundamentally reshaping how value is transferred and managed in the digital age. This infrastructure is not just about moving stablecoins; it’s about building the rails for a future financial system where digital assets are integrated seamlessly into everyday commerce and finance. The Rise of USDG Stablecoin: A Pillar of Stability in a Volatile Market The USDG stablecoin is a central component of Paxos’ ecosystem and the Global Dollar Network. Unlike many other stablecoins, USDG is designed with a strong emphasis on regulatory compliance and transparency, aiming to be a truly reliable digital representation of the US dollar. Cointelegraph reported that since its launch in November 2024, the stablecoin has achieved a circulating supply in the region of $356 million. This rapid growth, even with a relatively recent launch, highlights the market’s demand for regulated and trustworthy stablecoin options. What makes USDG stablecoin particularly compelling? Full Backing: Every USDG token is 1:1 backed by US dollar deposits and US Treasury bills, held in segregated accounts with FDIC-insured US banks. This ensures that the value of USDG remains consistently pegged to the dollar, offering stability in the often-volatile crypto markets. Audited Transparency: Paxos regularly publishes attestations by a top accounting firm, verifying the full backing of USDG. This commitment to transparency builds confidence among users and institutions. Regulatory Compliance: As a regulated entity, Paxos ensures that USDG adheres to strict anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) standards, making it a preferred choice for institutional players and businesses seeking compliant digital asset solutions. Programmability: Like other digital assets, USDG can be integrated into smart contracts and decentralized applications, unlocking new possibilities for financial innovation, automated payments, and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The substantial circulating supply achieved by USDG stablecoin in such a short period is a testament to its robust design and the market’s increasing preference for regulated, transparent stablecoins. This growth trajectory positions USDG as a significant player in the competitive stablecoin landscape, offering a reliable alternative for users seeking a digital dollar they can trust. Why is OKX Joining Paxos’ Global Dollar Network a Game Changer for Crypto Exchange Users? The decision by OKX , one of the world’s leading crypto exchange platforms, to integrate with Paxos’ Global Dollar Network is a significant development with far-reaching implications for its vast user base. This partnership is not merely a technical integration; it represents a strategic alignment that promises enhanced liquidity, efficiency, and new opportunities for millions of users. Here’s how this collaboration benefits OKX users and the broader crypto ecosystem: Enhanced Liquidity for USDG: By integrating USDG into its platform, OKX immediately boosts the stablecoin’s liquidity, making it easier for users to buy, sell, and trade USDG. Increased liquidity leads to tighter spreads and better execution prices for traders. New Trading Pairs and Opportunities: The availability of USDG on OKX could lead to the introduction of new trading pairs, offering users more diverse trading strategies and access to different markets. This expands the utility of USDG beyond simple transfers. Faster and Cheaper Settlements: Leveraging the Global Dollar Network, OKX users can experience faster and potentially cheaper settlements for transactions involving USDG, especially for cross-border payments or large-volume trades. This efficiency is crucial for both retail and institutional traders. Increased Trust and Security: For OKX users, the partnership with a regulated entity like Paxos and the use of a fully backed stablecoin like USDG adds an extra layer of trust and security. This can be particularly appealing to institutional investors and businesses looking for compliant pathways into the crypto market. Seamless Integration: The integration is designed to be seamless for users, allowing them to access USDG and the benefits of the Global Dollar Network directly through their existing OKX accounts, without needing to navigate complex external systems. This move positions OKX at the forefront of adopting regulated digital assets, catering to a growing demand for secure and compliant financial instruments within the decentralized space. It signifies OKX’s commitment to providing its users with the best and most reliable tools for navigating the digital economy. The Broader Impact: Reshaping the Stablecoin and Digital Asset Landscape The collaboration between OKX and Paxos’ Global Dollar Network extends beyond the immediate benefits for their respective users; it has significant implications for the entire stablecoin and digital asset landscape. This partnership serves as a powerful example of how traditional finance principles can converge with blockchain innovation to create a more robust and accessible global financial system. Institutional Adoption: A Bridge to Traditional Finance One of the most profound impacts of this partnership is its potential to accelerate institutional adoption of digital assets. Traditional financial institutions often hesitate to engage with cryptocurrencies due to concerns about regulatory clarity, volatility, and counterparty risk. By offering a regulated stablecoin like USDG through a major crypto exchange like OKX, the partnership provides a more familiar and secure entry point for these entities. Reduced Risk: Regulated stablecoins minimize the risk associated with unbacked or less transparent digital assets, making them more palatable for risk-averse institutions. Compliance Pathways: The adherence to AML/KYC standards by Paxos offers clear compliance pathways, which are essential for banks, asset managers, and corporate treasuries looking to explore digital assets. Operational Efficiency: The Global Dollar Network’s ability to facilitate instant settlements can significantly improve the operational efficiency of institutional trading and treasury management, attracting more capital into the digital asset space. Competitive Dynamics in the Stablecoin Market The stablecoin market is highly competitive, dominated by giants like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). The entry of USDG stablecoin into the mainstream via OKX introduces a strong contender, emphasizing regulatory compliance and transparency as key differentiators. This could lead to a healthy competition that benefits users through improved services, lower fees, and greater trust.

Future of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Centralized Exchanges (CEX) The partnership highlights a growing trend of synergy between CEXs and the broader DeFi ecosystem. While OKX is a centralized exchange, its integration with a regulated stablecoin and network like Paxos’ can bring the benefits of institutional-grade assets to DeFi applications. This could lead to more robust and reliable DeFi protocols that leverage the stability and compliance of assets like USDG. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities for USDG and Crypto Exchanges While the partnership between OKX and Paxos’ Global Dollar Network presents immense opportunities, the path forward is not without its challenges. The rapidly evolving regulatory landscape and intense competition in the stablecoin market require continuous adaptation and innovation. Regulatory Headwinds and Clarity Stablecoins are increasingly under the scrutiny of regulators worldwide. While Paxos prides itself on its regulatory compliance, future regulations could impact the operational frameworks of both the Global Dollar Network and the USDG stablecoin . Navigating these evolving rules will be crucial for sustained growth and broader adoption. Clear and consistent regulatory frameworks are essential for stablecoins to reach their full potential as a bridge between traditional and digital finance. Competition and Market Dominance Despite its unique selling points, USDG faces stiff competition from established stablecoins with deep liquidity and widespread adoption. Gaining significant market share will require sustained efforts in marketing, user education, and strategic partnerships. The ability to differentiate USDG through superior features, lower transaction costs, or unique ecosystem benefits will be key. Scalability and Interoperability Beyond the Network While the Global Dollar Network is designed for scalability, the broader interoperability with diverse blockchain networks and traditional payment systems will be an ongoing challenge. Ensuring seamless transitions between different digital asset ecosystems and fiat on/off-ramps is vital for mass adoption. Opportunities for Innovation and Growth Despite the challenges, the opportunities are vast. The partnership opens doors for: New Financial Products: The stable and regulated nature of USDG can enable the creation of innovative financial products on OKX and other platforms, such as lending protocols, derivatives, and structured products. Cross-Border Payments: The efficiency of the Global Dollar Network, combined with OKX’s global reach, can revolutionize cross-border payments, making them faster, cheaper, and more transparent for businesses and individuals. Broader Digital Asset Integration: As more institutions and businesses adopt USDG, it could pave the way for wider acceptance of other digital assets in mainstream commerce and finance. For investors and businesses, the actionable insight is clear: closely monitor the development of regulated stablecoins like USDG. Their integration into major exchanges like OKX signals a maturing market where stability, compliance, and efficiency are becoming paramount. Diversifying stablecoin holdings to include regulated options can mitigate risks and open new avenues for investment and treasury management. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a More Integrated Crypto Future The strategic alliance between OKX and Paxos’ Global Dollar Network represents a transformative moment for the digital asset industry. By integrating the regulated USDG stablecoin , OKX is not just enhancing its own offerings but also contributing to the maturation of the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. This partnership exemplifies the growing convergence of traditional financial rigor and blockchain innovation, laying down a robust foundation for a future where digital assets are seamlessly integrated into global commerce and finance. The benefits are clear: enhanced liquidity, increased trust, greater efficiency, and new opportunities for both retail and institutional participants. While challenges remain, the commitment of major players like OKX and Paxos to build compliant and reliable infrastructure signals a powerful shift towards a more secure, accessible, and integrated digital economy. This collaboration is a testament to the industry’s relentless pursuit of innovation, promising a more stable and efficient financial future for all.

The Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) discussed how existing laws, regulations and risk-management protocols apply to crypto ‘safekeeping.’ The agencies clarified that the statement does not create any new supervisory expectations, emphasizing the need for stronger risk-management practices. “[The statement] reminds banks that provide or are considering providing safekeeping of such assets that they must do so in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.” @federalreserve @FDICgov @USOCC issue joint statement on risk-management considerations for crypto-asset safekeeping: https://t.co/1VFNYCx75T — Federal Reserve (@federalreserve) July 14, 2025 Banks Can Provide Crypto Custody in Two Forms: Fed Agencies The trio of agencies stressed that the proper way to custody such assets involves “controlling the cryptographic keys associated with the crypto-asset in a manner that complies with applicable laws and regulations,” a detailed 7-page memo read. Further, banks can offer crypto custody in two forms: fiduciary and non-fiduciary, they added. In a fiduciary arrangement, where banks are legally authorized to act on behalf of clients like a trustee, specific federal regulations (12 CFR 9 or 150) must be followed. Additionally, state laws and regulations, and any other applicable legal provisions, are also in place, the statement noted. For non-fiduciary services, banks are mandated to implement robust protections to safeguard customers’ digital assets. This includes protection against cyber threats, data loss and mismanagement of private keys. Fed Agencies’ Pivot From Previous Crypto Guidances US Fed agencies have previously restricted banks from easily engaging with crypto businesses under the Biden administration. In March, the current crypto-friendly President Donald Trump signed a long-awaited crypto order that sets a federal agenda meant to move U.S. digital assets businesses into friendly oversight. As a result, the FDIC officially removed “reputational risk” as a factor in bank supervision, creating a significant victory for the crypto space. The agency also issued new guidance that cleared the way for supervised banks in the US to engage in crypto-related activities without seeking prior approval. The @FDICgov revised its crypto policy, letting banks engage in digital asset services without prior approval. Oversight continues through post-notification reviews. #CryptoRegulation #FDIC https://t.co/lOsoTfKKtN — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 29, 2025 The latest statement from the agencies arrives on the first day of the U.S. House of Representatives’ self-described Crypto Week .

Recently, Binance made a pivotal move, announcing the Binance PUMP conversion of its PUMP pre-market perpetual contracts into standard perpetual contracts. This isn’t just a technical tweak; it’s a strategic enhancement designed to streamline trading and potentially unlock new opportunities for traders. What’s the Big Deal? Understanding the Binance PUMP Conversion The core of this announcement revolves around the shift of PUMP’s trading status on Binance. Previously, PUMP was available via pre-market perpetual contracts, a specific type of derivative designed for assets not yet fully launched or widely available for spot trading. These contracts often come with unique characteristics, including specific settlement mechanisms and potentially higher volatility due to limited liquidity and price discovery. The Binance PUMP conversion to standard perpetual contracts signifies a move towards greater market maturity and accessibility for the PUMP asset. This conversion means that PUMP perpetual contracts will now operate under the same rules and conditions as other established perpetual contracts on Binance, offering a more familiar and predictable trading environment. For traders, this translates into several key changes: Enhanced Liquidity: Standard perpetual markets typically attract a wider range of participants, leading to deeper order books and potentially tighter spreads. Simplified Trading: The complexities often associated with pre-market contracts, such as specific settlement periods or unique margin requirements, are typically removed. Broader Accessibility: More traders might feel comfortable engaging with PUMP now that it operates within a standard framework. Demystifying PUMP Perpetual Contracts: What Changes? To fully grasp the implications of this change, it’s essential to understand the difference between pre-market and standard PUMP perpetual contracts . Pre-market contracts are essentially bets on the future price of an asset before its official launch or widespread trading. They serve as a mechanism for early price discovery and speculative trading, but often come with caveats like: Limited Trading Windows: Often restricted to specific times. Unique Margin Requirements: Potentially higher initial margins or specific collateral. Settlement Procedures: Different rules for how contracts are settled upon the asset’s official listing. In contrast, standard perpetual contracts are derivative instruments that allow traders to speculate on the price of an underlying asset without owning the asset itself, and without an expiry date. They are characterized by: 24/7 Trading: Continuous trading availability. Funding Rates: A mechanism to keep the perpetual contract price close to the underlying spot price. Standardized Margin: Consistent margin requirements across various assets. The conversion ensures that PUMP perpetual contracts now align with these standard features, offering a more robust and liquid trading experience. This standardization is a crucial part of the broader Binance trading update , reflecting the exchange’s commitment to providing diverse yet user-friendly trading options. How This Binance Trading Update Benefits You The recent Binance trading update for PUMP is more than just a procedural change; it’s a move designed to enhance the overall trading experience and market efficiency. For active traders and long-term investors alike, the benefits are clear: Increased Liquidity and Price Stability: With PUMP now on standard perpetuals, we can expect a significant influx of liquidity. This means it will be easier to enter and exit positions without causing significant price slippage. Greater liquidity also often leads to more stable and predictable price movements, reducing the impact of large individual orders. Enhanced Accessibility and Familiarity: Traders accustomed to standard perpetuals on Binance will find the PUMP market much more intuitive. This ease of access can attract more participants, further deepening the market. It removes the learning curve associated with specialized pre-market contracts, making PUMP more approachable. Improved Arbitrage Opportunities: As liquidity grows and the contract behaves more like a standard perpetual, arbitrage opportunities between PUMP’s perpetual contract and any potential future spot market or other derivative markets may become more consistent and viable for sophisticated traders. This strategic decision by Binance underscores its commitment to fostering a dynamic and accessible trading environment for its users, ensuring that even newer assets like PUMP can quickly integrate into the mainstream of crypto perpetuals trading. Navigating Crypto Perpetuals: A Strategic Move for Traders For anyone engaged in the world of crypto perpetuals , this conversion represents a key development that demands attention. The transition of PUMP from a niche pre-market offering to a standard perpetual contract integrates it more fully into the broader ecosystem of derivatives trading. Traders now have a more direct and standardized way to gain exposure to PUMP’s price movements, utilizing familiar tools and strategies. Actionable Insights for Traders: Re-evaluate Strategies: If you were trading PUMP pre-market, review your strategies. The new liquidity and behavior of standard perpetuals might require adjustments to your entry/exit points, stop-loss orders, and overall risk management. Monitor Funding Rates: Standard perpetual contracts involve funding rates. Understand how these rates work for PUMP, as they can impact the cost of holding positions over time. Leverage with Caution: While increased liquidity can make leverage seem less risky, the inherent volatility of crypto markets remains. Always use leverage responsibly and understand the liquidation risks. Look for Arbitrage: As PUMP becomes more liquid, keep an eye on potential price discrepancies between its perpetual contract and any future spot listings or other platforms, if applicable. This strategic shift provides a robust framework for traders to engage with PUMP, leveraging the familiar mechanics of standard perpetual contracts to potentially maximize their trading outcomes. The Future of Pre-Market Trading and Beyond While the focus here is on PUMP’s transition, this event also prompts a broader discussion about the role of pre-market trading on major exchanges like Binance. Pre-market offerings serve a crucial function in the crypto ecosystem by allowing early price discovery and liquidity for nascent projects. They provide a bridge between an asset’s initial hype and its full market debut. Binance’s decision to convert PUMP indicates a maturation path for assets that successfully navigate their pre-market phase. It suggests that once an asset demonstrates sufficient interest and stability, it can transition to a more conventional, liquid trading environment. This process can be seen as a positive sign for the ecosystem, indicating a structured approach to bringing new assets into mainstream trading. This conversion might set a precedent for how other successful pre-market listings will be handled in the future, fostering a more predictable and streamlined journey for new tokens from their initial offering to becoming fully integrated into the broader crypto derivatives landscape. Conclusion: Seizing the Opportunity in the New PUMP Landscape The Binance PUMP conversion from pre-market to standard perpetual contracts is a significant development for the PUMP token and its trading community. It marks a strategic move by Binance to enhance liquidity, simplify trading, and integrate PUMP more deeply into its extensive derivatives ecosystem. This Binance trading update provides a more robust and familiar environment for traders, aligning PUMP with the widely adopted structure of crypto perpetuals . For traders, this means more predictable trading conditions, potentially tighter spreads, and greater accessibility. It’s an opportune moment to reassess your trading strategies for PUMP, taking advantage of the increased liquidity and standardized mechanics. While the benefits are clear, remember to approach trading with caution, understanding the inherent risks of volatile crypto markets. This event underscores Binance’s ongoing efforts to innovate and refine its offerings, ensuring its platform remains at the forefront of the digital asset trading world. The future of PUMP trading, now firmly rooted in the standard perpetuals market, looks set for a more streamlined and liquid journey.

The price of BTC surpassed $120,000 for the first time in its history. According to Binance data, BTC continued to break records during the day yesterday and broke a new record by surpassing $123,000. However, this upward momentum was short-lived. After reaching a record high of $123,000, Bitcoin's price began to decline, falling to $117,000. This decline was also reflected in altcoins. Ethereum (ETH) fell below $3,000 again, dropping to $2,950. XRP fell 2.4% in the last 24 hours, Solana (SOL) fell 4.4%, and Dogecoin (DOGE) fell 6.6%. Analysis firm Alphractal stated that this decline was due to reduced buying pressure and selling pressure from investors seeking to take profits. Stating that this decline is normal, Alphractal stated that the current phase represents a natural correction phase and should be monitored carefully until the market stabilizes. Alphractal CEO Joao Wedson also stated that he expects a short-term correction. He noted that the downward trend could continue for some time, predicting that the BTC price could drop to as low as $108,000 before rising to $143,000-$148,000. “Short-term outlook for BTC: $115,000 seems inevitable, but a drop to $108,000 is still on the table before a potential rally to $143,000-$146,000 if momentum picks up. *This is not investment advice.

On Monday, on its “List-a-Thon” livestream, the platform announced it will be adding stocks of major US companies like Nike (NKE), McDonald’s (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), Coca-Cola (KO), Uber, and Yum! Brands (YUM). The platform now offers 37 equities to EU users following its earlier launches of tokenized stocks in late June and July 3. Gemini boosts EU market access with 21 new tokenized stocks across top sectors Gemini’s official blog highlights the latest stock additions as a major step forward in expanding its offerings for European users. The platform included 21 new equities on July 3, like Apple, Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, and crypto companies such as Coinbase and Marathon Digital (MARA) Holdings. Not too far from its initial launch of Strategy tokenized stocks, on June 27, for EU investors. Gemini’s latest addition includes 14 stocks across diverse industries, strengthening portfolio flexibility for EU investors. It includes popular brands like Nike, known for its athletic wear; McDonald’s, a global fast-food powerhouse; Starbucks, the coffeehouse leader; Coca-Cola, a beverage industry icon; and Yum! Brands, the parent of major chains like KFC, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut. The platform has now grown to encompass some SaaS giants like Cisco (CSCO), Adobe (ADBE), Snowflake (SNOW), and Hut 8 (HUT) as well. On the travel front, it gained significant players with Delta Air Lines (DAL), Booking Holdings (BKNG), Uber (UBER), Carnival Corporation (CCL), and Rocket Lab. Gemini is maintaining its relationship with Dinari, the issuer of dShares™—tokenized financial instruments that track the value of US equities 1:1 and provide the same economic rights, subject to legal limitations. Dinari manages token issuance , with tokens minted on the Arbitrum network for optimized performance. These tokenized stocks are available 24/7 on Gemini, charging a 1.49% trading fee. US-based crypto exchange and custodian service Gemini is bolstering its lineup of tokenized assets with the addition of BlockFi Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) funds. Token issuance is managed by Dinari, where tokens are minted on the Arbitrum chain to be more efficient. Gemini provides 24/7 trading availability for these tokenized stocks while charging a 1.49% fee per transaction. Gemini Intergalactic EU Artemis, Ltd, an entity authorized and regulated by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA), rolled out these stock offerings. Robinhood’s tokenized product is still under regulatory scrutiny Other firms are also moving into tokenized equities following Gemini’s lead. Robinhood, for example, debuted its “Stock Tokens” product to European customers on June 30, with as many as 215 stock tokens being issued on the Arbitrum Layer 2 network. But the launch has been met with setbacks, since the product is still facing regulatory scrutiny. Stock tokens are considered products in the stocks of companies like OpenAI and SpaceX. However, OpenAI has publicly disavowed the service and has raised further concerns. After Robinhood made the announcement, OpenAI warned users that the tokens are not real OpenAI equity, stressed it was not in any way connected with Robinhood, and emphasized that any valid transfer of its equity must receive prior written approval, which it did not. Recently, Lithuania’s central bank even asked Robinhood to clarify its tokenized equities further, following OpenAI’s response. The bank made it clear that only after the platform responds will they be able to evaluate the legality and compliance of the product. Addressing OpenAI’s comments, Vlad Tenev, CEO of Robinhood, only maintained that their tokenized product opens up access for retail investors by offering indirect exposure, a structure enabled by their investment in a special purpose vehicle. Meanwhile, Kraken and Bybit have also launched their tokenized offerings. Kraken now offers stock trading via interfaces modeled after standard crypto pairings, while Bybit offers its xStocks on both its TradFi and decentralized “Byreal” platforms.

While SHIB aims for a realistic price target of $0.00005, Ozak AI, currently priced at just $0.005 in its fourth presale stage, is eyeing the $1 milestone, which would represent an extraordinary 200x surge. The question facing investors is clear: which one holds the stronger upside potential by the end of 2025? Shiba Inu’s Steady Climb Toward $0.00005 Shiba Inu is one of the most recognizable meme coins within the crypto space. Originally launched as a playful opportunity to Dogecoin, SHIB has developed into a full-fledged ecosystem with its very own decentralized exchange (ShibaSwap), and even plans for a Layer-2 network referred to as Shibarium. As of now, SHIB trades at around $0.00001321, displaying resilience in market dips and keeping strong network support. Analysts recommend that SHIB may want to attain $0.00005 in 2025 under favorable conditions. For this goal to materialize, the overall market needs to enter a strong bull cycle, and Shiba Inu needs to deliver on its roadmap guarantees, especially in utility and adoption. If Shibarium achieves scalability and adoption amongst builders or users, it can deliver real use cases that push demand higher. However, SHIB is still heavily reliant on social sentiment and community-pushed hype. Unlike tokens with deeper essential backing, SHIB’s path to major price boom depends largely on viral traits, strategic burns of supply, and consistent interest from influencers. Although hitting $0.01 remains a distant dream, the $0.00005 goal is in the realm of opportunity, in particular if macroeconomic elements align in crypto’s choice. Youtube embed: Next 500X AI Altcoin Ozak AI’s Breakout Potential Toward $1 On the opposite end of the spectrum is Ozak AI —a project deeply rooted in utility, offering a real use case that merges blockchain infrastructure with AI-powered financial insights. Ozak AI’s platform includes components like the Ozak Stream Network (OSN), Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN), customizable AI prediction agents, and data vaults. These tools aim to empower both retail and institutional traders with high-quality predictive analytics derived from real-time data. Ozak AI is currently in its fourth Ozak AI presale stage, priced at just $0.005. With over $1.3 million already raised, the project has attracted early interest and is listed on both CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko . If Ozak AI gains market traction and delivers on its promises, a $1 price target would represent a staggering 200x return for current investors. Unlike SHIB, which relies heavily on meme power and community engagement, Ozak AI offers a more structured, innovation-driven investment case. Its architecture is designed for scalability and real-world integration—making it attractive to traders, analysts, and even institutions that are looking for smarter tools powered by artificial intelligence. If AI adoption continues to grow across industries, Ozak AI could be well-positioned to capitalize on this trend within the crypto space. Who Holds the Upper Hand Going Into 2025? Both SHIB and Ozak AI cater to different investor appetites. SHIB represents the nostalgia and momentum of the meme coin era, still capable of delivering short-term surges and driven by an extremely passionate community. But it also comes with risks tied to volatility and speculation, as it lacks substantial utility that would anchor its long-term value. Ozak AI, on the other hand, brings disruptive potential by offering predictive AI tools within a decentralized framework. As investors increasingly look beyond hype toward real innovation, Ozak AI’s fundamentals may provide a more solid foundation for sustained growth. The project’s ambitious goal of reaching $1 isn’t just based on hope—it’s rooted in an expanding market demand for AI-integrated financial tools. While Shiba Inu may succeed in hitting $0.00005 with continued community support and favorable market conditions, Ozak AI presents a more intriguing value proposition for those seeking exponential returns. The combination of AI utility, a growing presale, and early exposure at $0.005 makes Ozak AI one of the more compelling tokens to watch. Whether investors prefer meme power or machine learning, 2025 is shaping up to be a breakout year for both—but the smarter bet may lie in the AI-driven future that Ozak AI is building. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based crypto task that provides an innovative platform that focuses on predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized community technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to help crypto lovers and corporations make the perfect choices.

For years, traditional financial institutions, particularly banks, have eyed digital assets with a mix of fascination and caution. The primary hurdle? A distinct lack of clear, comprehensive rules. But now, a significant step forward has been taken, promising a new era of US crypto regulation . Imagine the relief for banks looking to dip their toes into the digital asset ocean! The Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) have collectively released a pivotal joint “blue paper.” This document isn’t just another piece of bureaucratic text; it’s a foundational guide, outlining how lending institutions are expected to manage their bank crypto holdings . It aims to demystify the regulatory landscape, providing much-needed expectations for banks engaging with digital assets. This move is a testament to the growing recognition of crypto’s permanence and the urgent need for a structured approach. What Exactly Is This Landmark Digital Asset Guidance? This joint paper, a collaborative effort from three of the most influential financial regulators in the United States, serves as a crucial framework for financial institutions. It’s designed to ensure that banks, as they explore or expand their involvement with cryptocurrencies, do so in a safe and sound manner. Think of it as a comprehensive playbook for navigating the complexities of digital assets, covering everything from custody to risk management. A Unified Stance: For the first time, these three key agencies have presented a united front, signaling a harmonized approach to crypto oversight. This eliminates much of the guesswork banks previously faced when dealing with disparate or ambiguous directives. Focus on Risk Management: The core of the guidance revolves around identifying and mitigating risks associated with crypto activities. This includes operational risks, liquidity risks, cyber risks, and compliance risks, ensuring banks maintain robust frameworks. Clarity for Diverse Activities: Whether a bank is considering holding crypto on its balance sheet, offering crypto custody services, or facilitating client crypto transactions, the paper provides clarity on the supervisory expectations for each activity. This isn’t just about setting rules; it’s about fostering responsible innovation within a secure financial system. The paper emphasizes that banks must possess the necessary expertise, infrastructure, and risk management systems before engaging in crypto-related activities. Why Was Regulatory Clarity So Urgently Needed for Bank Crypto Holdings? For years, the absence of clear directives left many banks in a state of paralysis. The potential for innovation and new revenue streams was evident, but the fear of regulatory backlash or unforeseen risks loomed large. This created a significant barrier to entry for mainstream financial institutions into the crypto space. Consider the landscape prior to this release: Aspect Before Joint Paper After Joint Paper (Expected) Regulatory Certainty Fragmented, ambiguous, or non-existent guidance. High legal and compliance risk. Unified, explicit guidelines from top regulators. Reduced uncertainty. Bank Engagement Hesitation, limited pilot programs, “wait-and-see” approach due to fear of regulatory penalties. Clearer path for strategic engagement, potential for broader adoption of crypto services. Risk Management Banks developing internal, often inconsistent, risk frameworks for crypto. Standardized expectations for robust risk management, aligning with traditional banking principles. Market Perception Crypto often viewed as a risky, speculative asset class, separate from mainstream finance. Increased legitimization of digital assets, paving the way for broader institutional acceptance. This regulatory clarity is not just beneficial for banks; it’s a crucial step for the entire digital asset ecosystem. It signals a maturation of the market and a recognition by traditional financial gatekeepers that crypto is here to stay and needs to be integrated responsibly. What Role Does the Federal Reserve Crypto Stance Play in This? The involvement of the Federal Reserve is particularly significant. As the central bank of the United States, the Fed’s stance carries immense weight, influencing monetary policy, financial stability, and the overall banking system. Their participation in this joint paper underscores the seriousness with which digital assets are now being viewed at the highest levels of financial governance. The Federal Reserve has previously expressed a cautious but open approach to digital currencies, exploring concepts like a central bank digital currency (CBDC) while also highlighting the risks associated with private stablecoins and other crypto assets. Their presence in this joint guidance suggests a concerted effort to: Maintain Financial Stability: Ensuring that the integration of crypto into the banking system does not introduce systemic risks that could jeopardize the broader financial system. Promote Sound Practices: Guiding banks to adopt best practices for managing digital assets, similar to how they manage traditional assets, but with an understanding of crypto’s unique characteristics. Foster Responsible Innovation: Creating an environment where banks can innovate with digital assets while adhering to robust regulatory standards. The Fed’s involvement essentially gives this guidance a powerful seal of approval, signaling to the banking sector that engaging with crypto is no longer a wild west endeavor but a regulated frontier. How Does This Digital Asset Guidance Empower Banks? This guidance offers more than just rules; it offers a roadmap for banks to confidently navigate the digital asset space. For financial institutions that have been on the sidelines, waiting for clearer signals, this paper is a green light to explore and potentially offer crypto-related services. It transforms uncertainty into opportunity. Key Empowerment Aspects: Reduced Compliance Risk: With explicit guidelines, banks can develop compliance frameworks that align directly with regulatory expectations, minimizing the risk of penalties or enforcement actions. Strategic Planning: Banks can now integrate crypto strategies into their long-term business plans, allocating resources, and building infrastructure with a clearer understanding of the regulatory boundaries. Enhanced Client Services: The ability to offer regulated crypto services, such as custody or trading, can attract new clients and retain existing ones who are increasingly interested in digital assets. Competitive Edge: Early movers who adapt quickly to these guidelines and build robust crypto offerings may gain a significant competitive advantage in the evolving financial landscape. This is not to say that the path will be entirely smooth. Banks will still face challenges, including the need for specialized talent, significant technology investments, and continuous adaptation to a rapidly evolving market. However, the foundational digital asset guidance provides a strong starting point. What’s Next for US Crypto Regulation and Banking? This joint paper is undoubtedly a significant milestone, but it’s important to view it as a beginning, not an end. The regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving, and this guidance lays the groundwork for future, more detailed rules and policies. Looking Ahead: Further Rulemaking: Expect more specific rules and regulations to emerge from these agencies, building upon the principles outlined in this initial guidance. This could include capital requirements for crypto exposures, specific consumer protection rules, and detailed operational standards. Industry Adaptation: Banks will need to invest heavily in understanding and implementing these guidelines. This includes training staff, upgrading systems, and potentially forming partnerships with crypto-native firms. Global Harmonization: As the US moves towards clearer regulation, it could influence other jurisdictions to follow suit, potentially leading to more harmonized global standards for crypto. Continued Dialogue: The regulators have emphasized that they will continue to monitor the market and engage with stakeholders, suggesting an iterative approach to regulation. For financial institutions, the actionable insight is clear: don’t wait. Begin assessing your current capabilities, identify potential gaps in your risk management and compliance frameworks, and prepare to integrate these new expectations into your operations. This proactive approach will be key to thriving in the new era of regulated bank crypto holdings . A New Era of Regulatory Clarity Dawns The release of this joint paper by the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC marks a monumental moment for both traditional finance and the cryptocurrency industry. It signifies a decisive shift from ambiguity to a structured framework for managing digital assets within the banking sector. This landmark US crypto regulation provides the much-needed regulatory clarity that banks have been craving, enabling them to confidently explore and engage with the burgeoning digital asset space. While challenges remain, the foundation has been laid for a more secure, stable, and integrated financial future where digital assets play a recognized role. This move not only legitimizes crypto further but also promises to unlock new avenues for innovation and growth within the regulated financial system. It’s an exciting time to watch how this guidance shapes the next chapter of finance.

The drop is largely due to a rapid increase in Pi’s circulating supply, weak demand, and low market liquidity. While Bitcoin enjoys the spotlight in this bull run, Pi Coin is struggling to keep up, and some in the community now fear the worst. Why Pi Network Price Today Remains Low Despite Mainnet Growth? Many Pi supporters admit they would love to see Pi hit $10 someday. But for this bull market, that dream is slipping further away. One of the biggest challenges facing Pi right now is the rapid increase in its circulating supply. With mobile mining rewards continuously being unlocked and more tokens migrating from testnet to mainnet, supply is growing faster than demand. This has led to over $37 million worth of Pi tokens getting migrated to the mainnet. But despite this growth, the price of Pi Coin is stuck near its lowest levels, trading around $0.45. Low Liquidity and Developer Inaction Weigh Heavily on Pi Coin Value The Pi community believes that rising supply , along with low market liquidity, is the main reason Pi is struggling to grow. There’s very little buying interest, and not enough liquidity to support price gains. On top of that, the project is facing criticism for limited support from the developer team. Many feel the Core Team is not giving enough space for community developers to contribute, which could be slowing innovation and shaking investor confidence. Pi Coin Technical Analysis Signals More Downside Ahead On higher time frames, the Pi price chart is showing lower lows, often a warning sign of further downside. When Bitcoin surged past $122,000 recently, Pi only touched $0.53 before crashing back down to $0.45 . However, Pi is currently trapped under the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement zone, suggesting it may continue to slide unless demand picks up. The next support lies around $0.40, a level which hasn’t been touched since the beginning of June. Pi Coin Forecast: Recovery Ahead or a Prolonged Crypto Winter? Despite the gloomy outlook, some see this dip as a rare opportunity. While others fear the end, a few view it as a time to accumulate. But with scammers outpacing community trust, engagement dropping, and more unlocks on the way, Pi’s short-term future looks shaky. The question now is: can Pi recover from this deep correction, or is this the beginning of a longer winter?",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|MINING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-15 05:26:20

SOL price is now correcting gains and might find bids near the $155 support zone SOL price started a fresh upward move above the $155 and $160 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $162 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $162 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $162 resistance zone. Solana Price Corrects Gains Solana price started a decent increase after it cleared the $160 resistance, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL climbed above the $162 level to enter a short-term positive zone. However, the price is facing a major hurdle at $168 and $169. A high is formed at $168.60 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $158 swing low to the $168 high. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $162 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading below $162 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. It is also trading below the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $158 swing low to the $168 high. The price is now approaching the $158 support. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $160 level. The next major resistance is near the $162 level. The main resistance could be $1685. A successful close above the $168 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $178. Any more gains might send the price toward the $185 level. More Losses in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $162 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $158 zone. The first major support is near the $155 level. A break below the $155 level might send the price toward the $150 zone. If there is a close below the $150 support, the price could decline toward the $145 support in the near term.

The legislation addresses central bank digital currencies, regulatory clarity for digital assets, and stablecoin frameworks. The proceedings already caused heated debates. Democrats like Rep. Maxine Waters and Rep. Jim McGovern criticised the bills for favoring Trump-linked crypto ventures and wealthy investors over consumer protections. Meanwhile, US regulators also issued joint guidance warning banks about the legal and operational risks of crypto custody services. Crypto Week Begins The US House of Representatives is set to deliberate on a series of key cryptocurrency bills this week as part of what Republican lawmakers call ”crypto week.” The legislative focus will be on three major proposals: the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act, and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act. These bills target issues related to central bank digital currencies, digital asset regulatory frameworks, and payment stablecoins. The House Committee on Rules, led by Republicans, first met on Monday to review the proposed amendments. (Source: Committee on Rules ) Among the most contentious developments are the series of amendments that were introduced by Democratic lawmakers. Representative Maxine Waters, a leading Democratic voice on financial regulation, submitted four alternative versions of the GENIUS Act. In her op-ed on MSNBC, she criticized the current bills as being crafted by and for the crypto industry rather than for consumer protection. Waters specifically raised concerns about President Donald Trump’s alleged conflicts of interest through his family-linked crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, which includes the USD1 stablecoin and the TRUMP meme coin. One of her proposed amendments is to ban US presidents, vice presidents, members of Congress, and their immediate families from holding or promoting cryptocurrencies. She also suggested the Treasury Secretary should be restricted from recognizing any foreign nation as having a comparable stablecoin regime if its leader referred to themselves as a dictator. This is likely a reference to El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele. On the Republican side, Representative Warren Davidson proposed an amendment to reinforce the right of individuals to self-custody digital assets through hardware or software wallets. Representative French Hill of Arkansas, chair of the House Financial Services Committee, fully supports the upcoming legislation, and stated that it will enhance investor protections while also cementing the US as a global leader in crypto innovation. With only eight legislative days remaining before the August recess, the timeline for final votes is tight. If the House moves quickly, floor votes on the bills could take place before lawmakers depart for the summer break. Democrats Slam Crypto Bills When crypto week’s first session began, it very quickly veered away from digital assets and into broader disputes over defense spending. Massachusetts Representative Jim McGovern opened with a scathing critique of the GOP’s legislative push, referring to the GENIUS, the CLARITY Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act as a “crypto giveaway.” He warned that the bills offer ineffective regulations because they benefit wealthy individuals and Trump-affiliated ventures at the expense of retail investors. McGovern mocked the notion of public demand for these bills by stating that no one in his district had asked him to make it easier for “crypto millionaires to get richer.” On the other side, Republican Representative Virginia Foxx defended the initiatives, especially the GENIUS Act, by calling it historic legislation that would position the US as a global leader in financial innovation. Foxx explained that the bill supports responsible development in the crypto space and could enhance America's standing in the global financial system. Despite Republican enthusiasm, the narrow majority in the House means that bipartisan support will likely be essential to actually advance the bills. Democratic lawmakers, including Representative Maxine Waters and Senator Adam Schiff, have expressed strong opposition, particularly over Trump's potential conflicts of interest via his family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, and its associated stablecoin, USD1. While the meeting was expected to focus on crypto regulation, the committee’s debate shifted toward discussions on the Department of Defense Appropriations Act. Still, House leaders made it very clear they intend to return to crypto issues soon and hope to pass the three bills before the August congressional recess. Regulators Warn Banks on Crypto Custody Meanwhile, three major US financial regulators—the FDIC, OCC, and Federal Reserve—jointly issued a document with details about the key risks banks face if they choose to custody crypto assets for clients. Part of the document that was shared by regulators While the guidance does not introduce new rules, it provides a risk framework for banks considering entry into the crypto sector. The document pointed out that banks must understand the complexities of digital assets, manage legal and compliance responsibilities, and remain accountable for any third-party custodians they employ. It also stresses the importance of robust audit programs, either internal or external, to ensure safe handling of crypto assets. The guidance was issued at a time when traditional financial institutions are showing more and more interest in crypto. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that a group of large banks is in early discussions to launch a joint stablecoin. Additionally, regulators have signaled a much more open stance toward crypto services by removing the “reputational risk” standard and issuing letters of approval for client-directed crypto transactions. At the same time, crypto-native firms like Ripple and Circle are looking to become regulated banks, which will just blur the lines between traditional banking and the digital asset economy even more.

Currently, all eyes are on the PUMP token , which has been demonstrating a fascinating resilience and unique market behavior since its inception. While many new tokens experience wild price swings, PUMP has maintained an unexpected stability, prompting leading on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X to delve deeper into the underlying metrics driving its performance. What makes PUMP different, and why are so many eyes on its journey in the volatile crypto market ? Unpacking PUMP Token’s Remarkable Market Performance The initial insights into the PUMP token ’s market activity paint a compelling picture of strategic planning and community engagement. According to the detailed analysis, the project team initiated the journey with a substantial $4 million in initial liquidity. This was not a one-time injection but rather added in multiple batches, a move that often signals a more thoughtful and long-term approach to market stability rather than a quick pump-and-dump scheme. This foundational liquidity is crucial for any new digital asset, providing a bedrock for trading and reducing extreme volatility in its early stages. What’s even more remarkable is how this initial capital has blossomed. Total liquidity for PUMP has surged to an impressive $50 million. This significant growth, as highlighted by the analyst, is predominantly fueled by the participation of retail investors . This isn’t just a number; it’s a testament to the organic interest and confidence from individual participants who are choosing to put their capital into PUMP. Such grassroots support is often a stronger indicator of a project’s health and potential longevity than mere institutional backing, as it reflects genuine belief from the wider community. Key Liquidity Milestones: Initial Liquidity Provided by Team: $4 million (added in multiple batches) Current Total Liquidity: $50 million (largely from retail participants) Furthermore, a substantial 24% community and ecosystem airdrop allocation is still pending announcement. This future distribution mechanism is a powerful tool for fostering a decentralized community, rewarding early adopters, and encouraging wider adoption. The anticipation of this airdrop could also be contributing to the sustained interest and holding behavior among current token holders, as they await potential benefits and further decentralization of the token’s supply. The Power of Retail Investors in the Crypto Market The narrative around PUMP is heavily influenced by the robust engagement of retail investors . In the broader crypto market , retail participation is a double-edged sword: it can drive massive rallies but also exacerbate crashes. However, in PUMP’s case, it appears to be a source of consistent strength. The fact that a significant portion of the $50 million in total liquidity comes from individual participants suggests a decentralized and resilient base. This contrasts with tokens heavily reliant on a few large whales, which can be prone to sudden, manipulative price movements. Why are retail investors flocking to PUMP? Part of the answer lies in its current valuation. The spot price for PUMP is hovering around $0.0055, which is notably above its public sale price of $0.004. This premium, though seemingly small, means that early public sale participants are already in profit. This positive sentiment from the outset can create a virtuous cycle, attracting more investors and fostering a sense of community success. It also suggests that the initial pricing was well-calibrated, or that demand has simply outstripped initial supply, pushing the price above its launch valuation. Understanding Investor Sentiment: Spot Price: ~$0.0055 Public Sale Price: $0.004 Significance: Early investors are profitable, fostering positive sentiment and attracting new interest. The consistent positive Binance futures funding rate for PUMP further reinforces this bullish sentiment, signaling strong long interest among traders. A positive funding rate means that long position holders are paying short position holders, indicating that the majority of futures traders expect the price to rise and are willing to pay a premium to maintain their long positions. This metric is a powerful real-time indicator of market conviction and can often precede significant price movements. Decoding On-Chain Analysis: What the Data Says About PUMP For those deeply entrenched in the world of digital assets , on-chain analysis provides an unparalleled level of transparency and insight into a token’s health. The data from PUMP is particularly intriguing. Beyond the spot price and funding rates, the stability of Open Interest (OI) in PUMP contracts post-launch is a critical indicator. Open Interest represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled. A stable OI, with both long and short positions holding firm, suggests a balanced market with conviction on both sides, rather than panic selling or speculative over-leveraging. This stability is especially noteworthy given a significant market dynamic: PUMP has not yet been listed on any major centralized spot exchange. Typically, a token’s price can be highly volatile before and immediately after a major exchange listing, often experiencing a “listing pump” followed by a “dump.” PUMP’s ability to maintain a stable price without the liquidity and exposure that a top-tier exchange provides is truly unexpected. This anomaly could be attributed to the strong underlying retail support and the absence of speculative trading that often accompanies major exchange listings, allowing the token to find its organic price floor and build a more stable foundation. On-Chain Insights Table: Metric Observation Implication Binance Futures Funding Rate Remains positive Strong long interest, bullish sentiment among derivatives traders. Open Interest (OI) Stable post-launch Balanced market, conviction from both long and short positions, no panic. Major Exchange Listing None yet for spot trading Unexpected price stability, suggests strong organic demand and holding. Navigating Digital Assets: PUMP’s Path Forward The journey of any new digital asset is fraught with challenges and opportunities. For PUMP, the current stability without major exchange listings presents a unique scenario. On one hand, it demonstrates organic strength and a dedicated community. On the other, a listing on a major exchange could unlock massive liquidity, broader accessibility, and potentially significant price appreciation. The question then becomes: when, and under what circumstances, will such listings occur, and how will the market react? The pending 24% community and ecosystem airdrop also remains a key factor. A well-executed airdrop can significantly boost community engagement and decentralization, but a poorly managed one can lead to sell-offs. The team’s strategy for this allocation will be critical in maintaining the current positive momentum and further solidifying PUMP’s position in the crypto market . Actionable Insights for Investors: Monitor Liquidity Trends: Keep an eye on how total liquidity evolves, especially the proportion contributed by retail. Continued growth signals sustained interest. Watch for Airdrop Announcements: Details on the 24% community allocation will be crucial for understanding future supply dynamics and potential price impact. Anticipate Exchange Listings: While PUMP has shown stability without them, a major exchange listing could be a significant catalyst. Research potential exchanges and their listing criteria. Track Funding Rates & Open Interest: These derivatives metrics provide real-time sentiment indicators. A sustained positive funding rate and stable OI indicate continued bullish conviction. PUMP’s current trajectory offers a compelling case study in organic growth and community-driven success. Its ability to maintain price stability above its public sale price, coupled with strong retail interest and positive futures sentiment, paints a promising picture. While the absence of major spot exchange listings might seem like a hurdle, it has perhaps allowed PUMP to build a more robust, less speculative foundation. As the project moves forward, the pending airdrop and potential future exchange listings will be pivotal moments that could define its long-term success in the competitive digital asset landscape.

Another $269 million came from short-side losses, taking the total liquidation figure to $675.8 million, marking one of the heaviest wipeouts since April. The heaviest blow landed on bitcoin (BTC) longs, which saw over $333 million in forced closures, followed by ether (ETH) at $113 million and XRP at $36 million. Solana’s SOL and dogecoin (DOGE) were also hit, shedding around $14 million each. Dogecoin was the worst-performing major, dropping over 7.6% on the day as speculative froth evaporated. BTC and ETH also fell 3.1% and 2.6%, cooling off after a nearly week-long rally. The largest single liquidation came from a $98.1 million BTC/USDT long on Binance, per liquidation tracker Coinglass. Even as bitcoin trades near record highs, some desks are stepping back from the euphoria. Derivative flows suggest that traders aren’t rushing to chase the upside, and elevated funding rates are making leveraged bets increasingly expensive. The sense is that markets may be due for a breather after an overheated run. ""With BTC in uncharted territory, short-term ceilings remain unclear,"" wrote QCP Capital in a note to clients. ""Funding rates are elevated, and the memory of February’s $2 billion liquidation event still lingers."" Options data paints a picture of cautious optimism, QCP wrote. While short-dated implied volatility ticked higher, it remains well below 2023 averages. September and December risk reversals still favor call options, hinting at longer-term bullishness, though traders appear reluctant to chase upside in the near term. Meanwhile, some analysts are urging traders not to mistake momentum for inevitability. Mounting institutional demand and macro shifts are undeniably fueling the rally, but they’re also raising the stakes. “The road to $150,000 by Q3 looks increasingly plausible, powered by ETF inflows, supply constraints, and macro tailwinds like a weakening dollar and potential Fed cuts,” Bitget’s Ryan Lee said in a note to CoinDesk. “The road to $150,000 by Q3 looks increasingly plausible, powered by supply scarcity and mounting institutional demand. Still, this isn’t a one-way street. Profit-taking, rate speculation, and geopolitical risks could spark a short-term pullback, potentially dragging BTC into a $105,000–$115,000 consolidation zone,” Lee added.

The transfer coincided with a pullback in Bitcoin prices, which slipped from above $123,000 to nearly $117,600, raising fresh questions about whether big players are offloading as retail interest surges. The transaction, flagged by blockchain analytics firm Spot On Chain, is part of a broader sequence of movements from a whale that has held the coins since 2011.

Altogether, 80,000 BTC has shifted hands in recent days, marking the first activity from this wallet in over 14 years. According to Spot On Chain, eight wallets associated with the whale moved 80,000 BTC, worth around $8.68b, after over a decade of silence. Two of these wallets originally received the coins in April and May of 2011, when Bitcoin traded at less than $4. At the time, the total value of the holdings was just $217,800. Today, that stash has multiplied nearly 40,000 times in value. Galaxy Digital Receives Over $2B in BTC Transfers, With Portions Headed to Exchanges Galaxy Digital has emerged as the main destination for these funds. Lookonchain reported that 16,843 BTC, now valued at over $2b, has been transferred to the firm so far. This Bitcoin OG with 80,009 $BTC ($9.46B) transferred another 7,843 $BTC ($927M) to #GalaxyDigital , for a total of 16,843 $BTC ($2B).

As Retail Chases New Highs, Whales Are Preparing to Sell on Binance “While new all-time highs are exciting, the data points to caution. The smart money is moving, and their actions often precede significant market shifts.” – By @Crazzyblockk pic.twitter.com/bA6TX6WKWr — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) July 15, 2025 Analysts Eye Profit-Taking Signals as Dormant Wallets Stir to Life The timing has drawn attention. While retail investors keep buying, encouraged by Bitcoin’s new highs, whales seem to be shifting into profit-taking mode. As a result, some analysts see these transfers as early signs that large holders may be exiting before volatility returns. Notably, the wallet originally acquired Bitcoin at around $2 per coin. This implies a staggering return. Now, the latest movements likely mark the first sell-off by the holder since those early days. As a result, the shift may signal a major change in mindset. Conor Grogan, Coinbase’s head of product, has previously speculated that such reactivations may be due to compromised keys, though he noted the likelihood remains slim. Nevertheless, the reawakening of long-dormant coins has historically sparked caution in the market. For now, the whale still holds about 11,000 BTC, about $1.3b, leaving room for further transfers. Traders are watching closely, wary of what might come next. As more institutional desks handle whale transactions, many suspect these movements are tied to OTC deals rather than direct market sales. Even so, their effect on sentiment is hard to ignore.

Major selloffs occurred during the 14:00–15:00 and 01:00–03:00 windows, with volume spikes of 735.09M and 704.60M, crushing the 24-hour average of 415.48M. A sharp reversal began during the final session hour as DOGE rose 0.84%, from $0.1923 to $0.1939, backed by volume bursts of 22.60M and 19.06M. Institutional activity was visible on both ends of the move, pointing to tactical capital flow rather than retail-driven volatility. News Background The selloff came amid rising anxiety over delays in potential crypto ETF approvals and a sudden resurgence in U.S. enforcement chatter around centralized exchanges. At the same time, market participants began speculating about fast-tracked ETF paths for high-volume tokens like DOGE and XRP, prompting whale-led accumulation near local lows. As a result, DOGE saw rapid directional whiplash — with institutional volumes confirming exits and re-entries. Price Action Summary Range: $0.21 → $0.19 | $0.022 span = 10.44% volatility Breakdown Zones: $0.200–$0.198 during 14:00–15:00 Volume Peaks: 735.09M (14:00), 704.60M (01:00) Support Zone: $0.190–$0.191 during late-session base build Final Hour (03:37–04:36): Price rose from $0.1923 → $0.1939 (+0.84%) Recovery Volume: 22.60M at 04:10, 19.06M at 04:09 during breakout push Technical Analysis Breakdown confirmed by lower-high, lower-low sequence into $0.19 session low Selling intensified as $0.200–$0.201 failed to hold during evening session Final-hour breakout above $0.1930 confirms localized reversal setup Key resistance: $0.1960–$0.1980 for short-term continuation Risk remains elevated if DOGE fails to reclaim $0.200 on sustained volume What Traders Are Watching Can DOGE reclaim the $0.198–$0.200 zone to restore trend structure? Rejection from $0.196 would likely confirm another leg down toward $0.188 Watch for follow-through volume above 400M to confirm trend shift Institutional wallet activity and futures OI positioning remain critical Takeaway DOGE’s 10% plunge was sudden but it wasn’t retail chaos. High-volume breakdowns and targeted re-entries show that institutions are playing both sides. While the bounce offers short-term relief, the macro structure remains vulnerable. Bulls must reclaim $0.200 fast — or risk deeper downside.

This substantial capital injection is earmarked for a unique dual strategy: acquiring both Bitcoin investment and gold. This decision signals a growing confidence in a diversified approach that bridges the traditional with the revolutionary, offering a fascinating glimpse into the future of asset allocation. A Bold Move: Understanding the Bitcoin Investment Strategy The allocation of a significant portion of newly raised funds towards Bitcoin underscores a profound shift in institutional perception. Once dismissed as a speculative digital novelty, Bitcoin has steadily matured into a recognized asset class, often dubbed ‘digital gold.’ Its decentralized nature, finite supply, and increasing adoption as a store of value have made it an attractive hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Growing Institutional Interest: More investment firms are adding Bitcoin to their portfolios, recognizing its potential for significant returns and its role in a diversified asset mix. Inflationary Hedge: With global economies facing inflationary pressures, Bitcoin’s capped supply makes it an appealing counter-asset. Digital Scarcity: Its inherent scarcity, similar to precious metals, provides a strong value proposition in the digital age. Digital Commodities’ move is not just about chasing returns; it’s a strategic positioning to capitalize on the ongoing digital transformation of finance. Their commitment to Bitcoin investment reflects a forward-thinking approach to managing capital in an increasingly digital world. The Timeless Appeal: Reassessing Gold Investment in the Modern Era While Bitcoin represents the new frontier, gold remains a cornerstone of traditional portfolios. Its inclusion in Digital Commodities’ strategy alongside Bitcoin is a testament to its enduring value and its role as a stable asset during turbulent times. Gold has historically served as a reliable safe haven, preserving wealth across generations and acting as a hedge against currency debasement and geopolitical risks. Why combine the oldest form of money with the newest? Diversification: Gold often has a low correlation with other asset classes, providing stability when markets are volatile. Proven Track Record: Centuries of history demonstrate gold’s ability to retain value during economic downturns. Tangible Asset: For many investors, the physical nature of gold offers a sense of security that digital assets cannot replicate. This balanced approach recognizes that while Bitcoin offers exciting growth potential, gold investment provides a time-tested anchor, creating a robust and resilient portfolio. Behind the Scenes: How Digital Commodities Funding Shapes Future Portfolios The $2 million raised by Digital Commodities is more than just capital; it’s a vote of confidence from investors who believe in the firm’s vision of a blended asset strategy. This funding allows Digital Commodities to execute its dual acquisition plan, building a portfolio that aims to capture growth from digital assets while maintaining stability through traditional commodities. The successful Digital Commodities funding round indicates a growing appetite among sophisticated investors for innovative strategies that look beyond conventional investment vehicles. It suggests that financial institutions are increasingly willing to explore and integrate digital assets into their core offerings, recognizing the demand from a new generation of investors seeking exposure to both established and emerging markets. The Best of Both Worlds? Exploring the Crypto Gold Hybrid Model The decision to invest in both Bitcoin and gold positions Digital Commodities at the forefront of a burgeoning trend: the crypto gold hybrid portfolio. This strategy aims to leverage the unique strengths of each asset class to create a more resilient and diversified investment vehicle. While Bitcoin offers exposure to rapid technological advancement and potential exponential growth, gold provides a stable, tangible hedge against various economic uncertainties. Benefits of a Crypto-Gold Hybrid: Enhanced Diversification: Mitigates risks by spreading investments across assets with different risk profiles and market drivers. Dual Hedging: Offers protection against both traditional inflation (gold) and potential fiat currency devaluation (Bitcoin). Broader Market Exposure: Captures value from both the traditional commodity markets and the rapidly expanding digital asset ecosystem. Challenges to Consider: Bitcoin Volatility: While maturing, Bitcoin can still experience significant price swings. Custody and Security: Ensuring the safe storage of both physical gold and digital Bitcoin requires specialized solutions. Regulatory Landscape: The crypto space is still evolving, posing regulatory uncertainties that do not apply to gold. Here’s a comparative look at these two powerful assets: Feature Bitcoin Gold Nature Digital, Decentralized Physical, Centralized Mining Supply Fixed (21 million) Finite, but variable mining Volatility High Moderate to Low Store of Value Emerging ‘Digital Gold’ Traditional ‘Safe Haven’ Accessibility Global, 24/7 Digital Market hours, physical transfer Beyond Tradition: The Expanding Landscape of Alternative Investments Digital Commodities’ strategy is part of a larger narrative where investors are increasingly looking beyond conventional stocks and bonds for growth and stability. The search for alternative investments has gained momentum as traditional markets face unprecedented challenges, including low interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical instability. This has led to a surge of interest in assets like cryptocurrencies, real estate, private equity, and even collectibles. For individual investors, this trend offers a crucial lesson: diversification is key. While not every investor can access specialized funds, understanding the principles behind a crypto-gold hybrid can inform personal portfolio decisions. Consider allocating a portion of your portfolio to assets that are less correlated with traditional markets, whether it’s through direct crypto exposure, gold ETFs, or other alternative assets that align with your risk tolerance. Conclusion: A New Dawn for Diversification Digital Commodities’ $2 million fundraising and its commitment to purchasing Bitcoin and gold mark a pivotal moment in the investment world. It underscores a growing recognition that future-proof portfolios will likely be those that strategically blend the proven stability of traditional assets with the innovative potential of digital currencies. This move is a powerful signal to the market, highlighting the evolving definition of value and the necessity of adapting investment strategies to a dynamic global economy. As the lines between traditional and digital finance continue to blur, firms like Digital Commodities are paving the way for a new era of diversified and resilient wealth management.

Traded under the tickers XRPQ and XRPQ.U on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the fund has become the largest XRP-focused ETF in Canada. The fund launched on June 18 and quickly positioned itself as a competitive offering in the Canadian market. The rapid inflow of assets highlights an important trend, which is the growing demand for regulated exposure to XRP among both institutional and retail investors. The Mass Appeal for XRP ETFs in Canada In its official post on X, 3iQ highlighted comments from Pascal St-Jean, President and CEO of the company, who pointed to the ETF’s structure as a key factor in its strong early performance. He said the achievement “shows the continuing strong interest in these assets” and reflects how investors are making more selective choices when allocating capital. Its standout feature, a 0% management fee for the first six months, has also been central to its early success. The ETF is also eligible for tax-advantaged accounts in Canada, including TFSA and RRSP, broadening its appeal to a wider segment of investors. By combining the transparency and accessibility of an exchange-traded fund with zero management fees at launch, this ETF differentiates itself from earlier digital asset products that often came with high costs and limited liquidity. We are proud to announce that our XRP ETF (TSX: XRPQ, XRPQ.U), Canada’s largest #XRP ETF, has accumulated over 50 million USD in client assets since its launch on June 18th. “This significant milestone for our XRP ETF shows the continuing strong interest in these assets and… pic.twitter.com/rpi3BmwE3W — 3iQ Digital Asset Management (@3iq_corp) July 14, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Race for a U.S.-Based XRP ETF The launch of XRPQ comes at a time when market participants are increasingly looking at blockchain-based assets not just for speculative gains, but also for portfolio diversification. Recent activity in the U.S. suggests a heated regulatory race to launch XRP-related exchange‑traded products. Asset managers, including ProShares, Franklin Templeton , Grayscale, and more, have filed with the SEC to introduce spot XRP ETFs, with several key deadlines approaching. Grayscale has also made notable strides in its attempt to convert its Digital Large Cap Fund, which includes XRP, into a spot ETF. While the SEC recently halted the process, Grayscale has revealed that it is working with key stakeholders to meet the SEC’s requirements and launch the product . While the U.S. lacks a dedicated spot XRP ETF, Canada has taken a leadership position, and the interest shown in 3iQ’s offering proves that investors are willing to engage with spot XRP ETFs. The strong debut of XRPQ could influence how future digital asset ETFs are structured, and may also affect future regulation that makes ETF launches easier.

In a market starving for explosive growth, two tokens trading under $0.10—Little Pepe (LILPEPE) and Cronos (CRO)—are now leading a new wave. And with the right timing, a $450 play on these tokens could balloon into $15,000 in just 15 weeks. Here’s why. LILPEPE: The Meme-Tech Rocket with 95x Potential Little Pepe is no ordinary meme coin—it’s the heart of a new Ethereum Layer-2 network focused on speed, scalability, and meme culture utility. LILPEPE is building its launchpad, tax-free ecosystem, sniper bot protection, and more. Its presale is currently in Stage 5 at $0.0014, and over 73.76% of the 5.25 billion tokens allocated have been sold, raising $4.64 million in the process. Once Stage 5 fills up, the price will increase to $0.0015, with the public launch listing set at $0.003—already offering buyers a guaranteed 114.28% gain at launch. But that’s just the beginning. Post-launch projections point toward a potential ATH of $0.134, which would represent a 9,487% surge—or nearly 95x your initial investment. That means $300 in LILPEPE today could realistically grow into $28,500 within the next few months. Add that to a meme coin ecosystem giving away $770,000 worth of tokens to ten lucky winners ($77K each), and you’ve got FOMO written all over it. Even industry insiders are noticing the momentum, with prominent mentions in publications like AInvest and GlobeNewswire , both of which highlight whale movements and heavy retail participation. Investors who jumped in at $0.0010 are already up over 40%. CRO: The ETF-Backed Utility Sleeper Cronos (CRO), the native token of the Crypto.com blockchain, has been in accumulation mode, but that silence has just been broken. Following a 20% daily price surge, CRO is back on the radar, thanks to the hype surrounding its potential inclusion in a new “blue-chip” crypto ETF reportedly backed by Truth Social. This narrative helped CRO climb from $0.08 to $0.09 within hours, as reported by Coinpedia and Crypto. News . The token’s technical indicators are also intense—MACD flips, RSI momentum, and heavy whale inflows suggest a breakout to $0.11 or even $0.13 is within reach. On the fundamentals side, CRO powers an ecosystem of over 80 million users across the Crypto.com app, DeFi, and NFTs. According to a recent forecast by Cryptopolitan , CRO could average $0.0963–$0.1076 in the near term, with some price models suggesting upside to $0.26 in a bullish environment. On Reddit , users are even speculating that a run to $1 is a long-term possibility. So if you allocate $150 to CRO and it doubles or triples, you’re looking at a return of $300–$450, safely balancing the rocket-like trajectory of LILPEPE with something grounded. Why Dogecoin Can’t Keep Up At around $0.30, Dogecoin has already lost most of its speculative punch. Even if it doubles or triples, you’re still looking at gains capped at 2x to 3x, and that’s assuming Elon Musk tweets something exciting. In contrast, both LILPEPE and CRO have serious catalysts brewing. LILPEPE is driving community virality, whale accumulation, and Layer 2 development simultaneously. CRO is benefiting from rising institutional exposure, strong fundamentals, and surging user adoption. That combination—speed and strength—makes a $450 portfolio (split between $300 in LILPEPE and $150 in CRO) a seriously compelling bet. How $450 Becomes $15,000 If LILPEPE surges to $0.134 post-launch as projected, $300 becomes $28,500. If CRO doubles or triples from its current position, $150 becomes $300–$450. Together, you’re looking at a real possibility of turning $450 into $15,000 or more. And best of all? The timeline is short. With presale Stage 5 nearly 74% filled, the window is rapidly closing. LILPEPE’s listing is right around the corner, and CRO’s chart is heating up. Conclusion: Choose Momentum, Not Memory Dogecoin had its run. But nostalgia doesn’t generate returns—strategy does. Currently, that strategy points to LILPEPE and CRO. One delivers the hype and heat, the other the utility and adoption. The blend is perfect. If you’ve been sitting on the sidelines, wondering when the next big move will come, this is it. Don’t watch it happen. Position yourself before the fireworks begin.

The bloc has targeted $84 billion worth of U.S. goods, including automobiles, Boeing aircraft, and bourbon, amid heightened global trade tensions. A 206-page list issued by the European Commission on Monday showed that the bloc’s finalized countermeasures are also directed towards machinery products, plastics, chemicals, electrical equipment, medical devices, agricultural goods, and wine. According to the list, the EU didn’t include tariff rates for the goods.

The U.S. imposed reciprocal levies on most EU goods and added 25% tariffs on automobiles and auto parts. The U.S. later settled on a baseline 10% rate to allow for trade negotiations with nations globally. Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke also mentioned at a news conference in Brussels on Monday that Trump’s tariff threat was unacceptable. The bloc accused the U.S. of being reluctant to settle for trade negotiations and warned it of issuing countermeasures if no deal is reached by August 1. The U.S. President warned over the weekend he would raise the bloc’s levies to 30% if there are no trade deals before the deadline on August 1. Trump acknowledged that he is open to further discussions with the bloc and other trading partners. “They would like to do a different kind of a deal and we’re always open to talk, including Europe. In fact, they’re coming over. They’d like to talk.” -Donald Trump, U.S President. The European Union initially issued the list targeting U.S. goods worth 95 billion euros, but it was minimized after dialogue with countries and firms within the bloc. The EU also requires its 27 nations to give their approval before the adoption of the list. The 27-nation bloc had previously issued countermeasures of 21 billion euros on U.S. imports but later extended it to counter Trump’s additional tariffs on steel and aluminum. Italy’s Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani revealed over the weekend that the EU was ready with roughly $24.5B worth of countermeasures against U.S. goods if both parties failed to reach a deal. The EU also plans to tariff over 65 billion euros of industrial goods, including 11 billion euros on aircraft, approximately 9.4 billion euros on machinery, and roughly 8 billion euros on cars. The EU also targeted 6 billion euros on agricultural products, including 2 billion euros on fruits and vegetables and around 1.2 billion euros on alcoholic beverages. The 27-nation bloc also issued 500 million euros on toys and hobby equipment, 200 million euros on musical instruments, and more than 300 million euros on sports guns.

He believes there is still a chance for continued negotiations, but argued that the bloc is yet to settle on a good deal with its largest trading partner. Sefcovic revealed on Monday that there are more plans to meet with the Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum mentioned that she is hopeful for a trade deal on security with the U.S. Trump has accused the country of not making more effort towards combating fentanyl flow into the U.S., adding that the 30% tariff on Mexico would not apply to goods shipped under the USMCA trade agreement. She also maintained that no deal will include the U.S. forces entering Mexican borders, as mentioned by Trump. South Korea officials stated Monday that Trump’s deadline made it impossible to reach a deal and offered to expand access of its agricultural market to the U.S. Seoul’s Minister for Trade Yeo Han-Koo also acknowledged that the country was cautious to avoid heightened U.S. levies on major industries that would undermine the economic relationship with its main trading partner.

Investors remained focused on ongoing trade talks, while also anticipating key U.S. inflation data and a wave of bank earnings later in the week. On the geopolitical front, US President Donald Trump reiterated openness to renewed tariff negotiations with the European Union and other key trading partners. Geopolitical tensions added to the uncertainty after President Trump threatened to impose secondary tariffs of 100% on Russia unless a peace agreement with Ukraine is reached within 50 days. Gold prices rose to around $3,360 per ounce on Tuesday, as concerns over the impact of US President Donald Trump's tariff war enhanced the metal’s safe-haven appeal. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.24% to below 39,430 while the broader Topix Index rose 0.5% to 2,837 on Tuesday, with Japanese shares showing mixed performances. The Japanese yen hovered around 147.6 per dollar on Tuesday, near its lowest level in two months, as persistent trade-related tensions weighed on sentiment. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.65% slipping 0.2% to around 3,510 while the Shenzhen Component rose 0.4% to 10,730, as investors digested a raft of economic data that painted a mixed picture of the recovery, and the offshore yuan steady to around 7.17 per dollar on Tuesday, pausing gains for the second consecutive session. China’s economy expanded 5.2% yoy in Q2 2025 , slowing from 5.4% in the prior two quarters and marking the slowest pace since Q3 2024. China's industrial production rebounded strongly in June 2025, with a 6.8% year-on-year increase, marks a significant acceleration from May's 5.8%. China's retail sales increased by 4.8% year-on-year in June 2025, slowing from over one-year high of 6.4% and missing market expectations of a 5.6% gain. China’s fixed-asset investment rose by 2.8% year-on-year in the first half of 2025, coming in below market forecasts of a 3.7% growth. China’s surveyed unemployment rate stood at 5.0% in June 2025, unchanged from the previous month and in line with market expectations. China’s industrial capacity utilization rate decreased to 74 percent in the second quarter of 2025 from 74.9 percent in the same period a year earlier, marking the lowest rate since the first quarter of 2020. China’s new home prices in 70 cities declined by 3.2% year-on-year in June 2025, slowing from a 3.5% drop in the previous month. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 0.36% to 24,244 around midday Tuesday, snapping a three-session winning streak. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.24% to 82,390 in early trade on Tuesday, snapping a four-session losing streak. The index attempted to rebound from its three-week low touched the previous day, supported by hopes of a potential US-India trade deal. Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said on Monday that negotiations with the US are expected to result in a ""win-win"" trade-complementing agreement. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.59% to 8,623 on Tuesday, rebounding from a modest decline in the prior session and reaching its highest level in over a month. The Australian dollar edged higher to around $0.654 on Tuesday, following a notable decline in the previous session. Domestically, sentiment was further buoyed by positive economic data, with the Westpac-Melbourne Institute Consumer Sentiment Index rising by 0.6% month-on-month to 93.1 in July 2025, following a 0.5% uptick in June. Investors are now turning their attention to key domestic data releases later this week, including consumer inflation expectations and the latest employment figures. In the U.S., on Thursday, all three major indexes ended slightly higher as investors weighed renewed tariff threats from President Trump against optimism over upcoming earnings and inflation data. President Donald Trump urged the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates to 1%, arguing it would reduce federal borrowing costs and boost economic growth. “We need a 1% rate. The Fed is killing growth,” he said on Monday. Investors now await the US CPI report, due later today, for more clues into the Fed's rate path. U.S. stock futures slightly higher on Tuesday as investors turned cautious ahead of major bank earnings and a closely watched inflation report: Dow +0.08% ; S&P 500 +0.30% ; Nasdaq +0.49% .

Users need BNB and Alpha Points to join events; buy orders remain locked until event ends. Binance enters the bonding curve race as meme coin platforms like LetsBONK surpass Pump.fun in activity. New Token Event Model Debuts on Binance Wallet Binance has introduced a new pricing model for token generation events (TGEs) through its Wallet. The system follows a bonding curve structure, where token prices move higher as more users buy during the event window. Meanwhile, this approach mirrors the mechanism used by Pump.fun and was developed in partnership with meme coin launchpad Four.Meme. Binance confirmed that this is the first time it has offered such a model. The first project using this setup will be announced on July 15 via the Binance Wallet X account. We’re redefining token launches with the introduction of the Exclusive Bonding Curve-Based Token Generation Event (TGE) on Binance Wallet, in collaboration with https://t.co/a6yKhb5iK9 . The first project to use this Bonding Curve TGE model will be revealed tomorrow. Know more… pic.twitter.com/uQ36m0Vwsb — Binance (@binance) July 14, 2025 Live Pricing and Locked Orders During Events The new format allows users to buy and trade non-transferable tokens with BNB while the event is live. Prices rise automatically based on real-time demand. Once the event ends, the tokens can be transferred and traded on Binance Alpha. Users will not be able to cancel orders once they are placed. BNB used for purchases stays locked until the event closes. Binance described the structure as one that offers a more open way to determine token value before a full market listing. To take part, users need a balance of Binance Alpha Points along with BNB in their Wallet. Alpha Points are part of Binance’s internal system used to score eligibility based on platform activity. The goal is to make access more consistent for active users while limiting automated trades during the token event. Binance said the system is designed to give users a clearer way to join early-stage token sales. Memecoin Launchpads and User Risks The update comes as competition grows between meme coin platforms. LetsBONK has recently passed Pump.fun in token launches and trading volume on Solana. User caution remains a topic across platforms. Analytics firm Lookonchain reported a case where a user lost $75,000 in PUMP tokens.

At the same time, BlockDAG (BDAG) is taking a smarter path. It’s made for those who want more access upfront, not delays. With $338 M raised, 2 million+ X1 miner users, and a clear plan already rolling, BlockDAG is focused on action, not hype. BTC Bull Rockets 82% In One Day BTC Bull’s price jumped 82% in a single day, grabbing attention and reigniting interest from meme coin enthusiasts. The coin now trades around $0.0055. Traders are circling, driven by renewed volume and social media chatter. Bold BTC Bull price predictions are emerging by the hour. However, underneath the buzz, the project lacks structure. Like most meme coins, it’s fueled by community sentiment and market timing. There’s no clear plan, no unique function, just rapid spikes that thrill short-term buyers but worry long-term holders. That doesn’t make BTC Bull a bad play, it just carries risk. If momentum holds, it could climb further. If not, it may fade as another flash in the meme coin game. For now, it’s loud, fast, and full of hype. BlockDAG’s $338M Presale Confirms Growing Demand and Early Strength BlockDAG is taking a more tactical route. With the BEAT VESTING PASS, buyers can unlock 80% of their coins at launch instead of the usual 40%. That offers much greater flexibility and freedom for early participants. BlockDAG has raised $338 million through its presale and is entering Batch 29, priced at $0.0276 per coin. So far, 23.8 billion coins have been sold. People who bought in Batch 1 are seeing a staggering 2,660% gain compared to the original Batch 29 price. The launch price is set at $0.05. As part of the GLOBAL LAUNCH release, the current purchase price is $0.0016 until August 11, one of the lowest price. If users buy now, they could see a 3,025% return based on the $0.05 launch price. The BEAT VESTING PASS applies only to non‑bonus coins: 80% of non‑bonus coins are unlocked at launch. Bonus coins are excluded from this early release. This isn’t just a marketing gimmick, it’s a clear strategy to give participants control from day one. No long lockups, no slow schedules. Buyers know exactly what they’re getting and when they’ll get it. Supported by $338 M raised, momentum from 2 million+ X1 miner app users, and a roadmap already in motion, BlockDAG is prioritizing delivery over hype. In a market where timing and clarity matter, the BEAT VESTING PASS offers real structure and a strong foundation. Long-Term Growth Favors BlockDAG Over Bull BTC Bull is enjoying a moment in the spotlight. With a fast price rise and meme-level attention online, it’s grabbing short-term interest. But these trends often come and go. BTC Bull still lacks a roadmap, defined purpose, or a real use case that could hold value long-term. It’s riding hype, but that alone isn’t enough to sustain real momentum once excitement fades. In contrast, BlockDAG offers a more grounded approach. With its BEAT VESTING PASS, early participants get to unlock 80% of non-bonus coins at launch, giving them more control right from the start. It’s a presale with structure, not just noise. Backed by $338 M raised, strong community traction, and over 2 million X1 miner app users, BlockDAG is built for those looking beyond the hype toward steady, long-term potential. Conclusion BTC Bull is creating buzz, thanks to its sharp 82% price spike and viral chatter. But buzz fades fast if it isn’t backed by something solid. For BTC Bull to maintain attention, it needs more than social media excitement. It needs real features, community trust, and a clear reason for people to stay. Without those, it may just become another meme coin that shined briefly before fading out. BlockDAG, however, is offering more than just talk. Its BEAT VESTING PASS gives early participants 80% of their non-bonus coins unlocked at launch, providing more freedom and movement from day one. Add to that a $338 M presale raise, growing app users, and a transparent roadmap, it shows strong planning. While meme coins chase hype, BlockDAG focuses on real delivery and long-term value from launch day onward.

The bank also predicts an “upside scenario” for Bitcoin of $155,000 by December 2025. In a research report released today, TD Cowen attributed its optimism for Strategy stock to the company's massive Bitcoin portfolio and potential price increases. The company recently purchased an additional 4,225 BTC for $472.5 million, bringing its total BTC holdings to 601,550. The average unit cost for these purchases was $111,827. Related News: Another Country Announces Plan to Create Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Fund TD Cowen believes the company's aggressive BTC accumulation plans could yield significant long-term returns. The report stated, “This strategy, initially launched to protect the value of reserve assets, has now evolved into an opportunistic approach aimed at increasing shareholder value.” The firm's baseline scenario is for Bitcoin to reach around $128,000 in December. A potential “downside” scenario sees the price at $55,000. Today, BTC broke a new record, surpassing $120,000 for the first time in history. The strategy aims to raise a total of $84 billion through debt and equity for future Bitcoin acquisitions under its “42/42 plan.” TD Cowen predicts that this strategy could generate approximately 900,000 BTC for the company by the end of 2027. *This is not investment advice.

With July bringing fresh volatility and major headlines across crypto, the race for early access is on. The best part? These top cryptos to join in 2025 aren’t just riding old trends. They’re shaping the narrative, drawing in a new wave of investors, and igniting serious buzz on crypto forums and social channels. As the market preps for the next bull run, it’s not just about catching up, it’s about getting ahead. Here’s a close look at four top cryptos to join in 2025 that are making waves right now, including one meme coin whose exclusive whitelist is sparking a rush for early spots. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU): Unstoppable Bull Energy and Early Access Hype MoonBull isn’t just another Ethereum meme coin. It’s built for those chasing major upside, with a structure designed for high-octane community energy. What’s turning heads? MoonBull’s whitelist is live, but only for a limited time, and those who get in now are the ones unlocking all the benefits.

Whitelisted users will secure the lowest entry price, private roadmap hints, bonus token drops, and even exclusive staking rewards. No details go public before launch, making MoonBull a true insiders’ club for meme coin degens and crypto risk-takers looking for the top cryptos to join in 2025. Why MoonBull Keeps Making the List of Top Cryptos to Join in 2025 The combination of hype, exclusive perks, and true scarcity is building moon bull’s reputation as the go-to project for high-energy traders this summer. MoonBull’s blend of early access, bonus rewards, and real community-driven energy makes it one of the top cryptos to join in 2025 before the rest of the market catches up. To get a spot, simply submit an email through the secure whitelist form. Those who make the list will get a direct notification ahead of launch, putting them one step ahead of the crowd. Supply is limited. As more traders start eyeing this launch, bulls are on the move. Missing this window could mean missing the next big story of the meme coin market. 2. Pepe (PEPE): The Deflationary Meme Coin That Won’t Quit Pepe exploded onto the Ethereum scene as a tribute to the internet’s legendary frog meme. Its simple, pure memecoin status, no tax, no hidden agenda, keeps the appeal honest and raw. Pepe has become a staple in meme coin circles, drawing in degens and crypto enthusiasts looking for that perfect blend of nostalgia and viral potential. What keeps Pepe in the headlines? Its deflationary model means the supply drops over time, creating constant buying pressure. Community support, combined with relentless meme power, has allowed PEPE to carve out its own lane. In July, the chatter around top cryptos to join in 2025 includes Pepe not for utility or tech, but because it thrives on buzz and market momentum. Why did this coin make it to this list? Pepe’s relentless energy and status as a pure, crowd-driven meme coin prove that, in the right market, simplicity and meme magic are enough to keep a project trending and growing. 3. Bonk (BONK): The People’s Dog Coin on Solana Launched on the Solana blockchain, Bonk stands out as the first dog-themed coin that put the power directly into the hands of its community. With half of its total supply airdropped to Solana users, Bonk is all about fair access and breaking the mold of “toxic” tokenomics. This transparency and inclusivity are exactly what’s helping Bonk trend as one of the top cryptos to join in 2025. Bonk’s popularity has been growing with the Solana ecosystem. Community engagement is at the heart of every move, from airdrops to ongoing upgrades. As more traders look beyond Ethereum for the next wave of meme coin potential, Bonk’s accessibility and strong narrative are pushing it onto must-watch lists everywhere. Why did this coin make it to this list? Bonk is proof that community-first models can capture serious market attention and hold it, especially when fair launches and viral stories align. 4. Dogwifhat (WIF): Solana’s Viral Sensation Is Gaining Steam Dogwifhat has become a household name for Solana meme coin fans. Launched in late 2023, this Shiba Inu coin, complete with its signature knitted hat, quickly captured the hearts (and wallets) of meme traders everywhere. Built on Solana, Dogwifhat combines fast, low-fee transactions with a pop-culture-friendly mascot. Dogwifhat’s rise is fueled by organic social hype and a strong “viral” energy, making it a favorite among younger traders. Its position as one of the top cryptos to join in 2025 comes from both its community loyalty and its creative approach to branding. Why did this coin make it to this list? Dogwifhat is living proof that when a meme coin combines strong branding, rapid adoption, and passionate holders, it can jump from newcomer to headline maker in record time. The Bottom Line Based on the latest research, the top cryptos to join in 2025 are MoonBull, Pepe, Dogwifhat and Bonk.

The asset is currently trading at $2.87, marking a 26% increase from the previous week. Over the last 24 hours, XRP has tested the $3 level multiple times, fueling renewed speculation about its immediate future. Amid this volatility, crypto expert Edoardo Farina shared a bold projection, stating, “XRP could make a new all-time high within 48h.” $XRP COULD MAKE A NEW ALL TIME HIGH WITHIN 48H — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) July 14, 2025 Farina’s prediction arrives at a pivotal moment for XRP, as it continues its sustained rally amid a broader crypto resurgence. XRP reached its all-time high of $3.84 in January 2018, and the closest it has come since then was January 2025 when it hit $3.35. However, Farina is confident that it will surpass $3.84 over the next 48 hours. The asset’s recent strength follows a series of technical confirmations , and Farina’s prediction adds urgency to the outlook, implying that a major milestone may be closer than many anticipated. Community Excitement for XRP Reactions from the XRP community show optimism and confidence that Farina’s prediction will come true. One commenter emphasized how fast the market environment is evolving, and rapid shifts in sentiment could lead to significant outcomes in a short time frame. This aligns with XRP’s historical tendency to move quickly once key resistance levels are broken. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Other responses also expressed hope that Farina’s projection will materialize soon. Some welcomed the forecast but remained reserved, signaling a wait-and-see approach. Others offered direct affirmations of the token’s future, confidently stating that XRP could climb even higher. Will XRP Surpass $3.84? Supporters also pointed to fundamental drivers backing the price movement. One user cited the combination of regulatory clarity, global partnerships, and real-world utility as reasons he has maintained a strong conviction in XRP over the years. The same user suggested that what lies ahead may serve as validation for that stance, should Farina’s prediction materialize. A well-known crypto millionaire recently highlighted $3 as the neckline for a cup-and-handle pattern that could push XRP to $5.2 once the breakout is confirmed. As XRP approaches the $3 threshold, all eyes are on whether it can sustain momentum and surpass its previous high. Farina has consistently advised against selling XRP early , and the next two days could prove to be defining ones for the digital asset and those who took his advice to hold their tokens.

Key Takeaways: Bit Digital plans to raise $67.3 million through a direct share offering to buy more Ethereum. The company recently converted its entire Bitcoin holdings to Ether. Bit Digital’s move aligns with growing institutional interest in Ethereum amid a rising crypto market. The proceeds will be used exclusively to purchase Ethereum, further expanding the company’s growing ETH treasury, the firm said in a Monday announcement . Priced at $3.06 per share, the offering is managed by B. Riley Securities and is expected to close around July 15. Bit Digital Converts Entire Bitcoin Holdings to Ethereum The move follows Bit Digital’s recent decision to convert its entire Bitcoin holdings into Ether , reflecting a strategic pivot toward Ethereum. As of early July, the firm held roughly 100,603 ETH, valued at approximately $301 million. Bit Digital offers a range of services including validator operations, enterprise custody, and yield optimization. It began building its Ethereum stake and engaging in staking activities in 2022, signaling a long-term commitment to the Ethereum ecosystem. In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Bit Digital disclosed its preliminary estimated revenue for the second quarter to be between $24.3 million and $26.9 million. Despite a slight dip in its stock price by 1.2% to close at $3.29 on Monday, shares have risen more than 32% over the last month. Ethereum’s price has also gained momentum, rising 0.6% to $2,991 and climbing over 18% in the past week amid a broad crypto market rally. Meanwhile, Bitcoin remained relatively flat, dipping slightly to $118,852. Bit Digital’s latest capital raise and strategic shift toward Ethereum comes amid growing institutional interest in the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. Bit Digital CEO: ""This is why we switched from Bitcoin mining to a 100% Ethereum treasury strategy…"" pic.twitter.com/dz7HB6Ldf6 — Traders Paradise (@theparadiselive) July 15, 2025 On Monday, SharpLink Gaming increased its Ethereum holdings with a fresh acquisition valued at nearly $49 million. As reported, the company received 16,374 ETH on Sunday afternoon, sourced from a wallet that had recently purchased the tokens from Galaxy Digital’s over-the-counter market. Last week, Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin said the company has been purchasing tens of millions of dollars worth of ETH every day. “We are accumulating more and more consistently — we’re able to acquire tens of millions of dollars in Ether a day,” Lubin told CNBC. More Public Companies Diversify into Crypto Following the model pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, more public companies are diversifying into crypto holdings that include BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP. Just recently, BIT Mining announced plans to raise between $200 million and $300 million to build a Solana (SOL) treasury as part of a broader expansion into the fast-growing blockchain ecosystem. Last week, DeFi Development Corp. revealed that it has acquired $2.7 million worth of Solana as part of its aggressive crypto treasury strategy. Likewise, Canadian digital asset firm Sol Strategies, already trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange, holds over 420,000 SOL tokens, positioning itself as a significant institutional player in Solana’s ecosystem. Last month, the firm also filed to list its common shares on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker “STKE” as it ramps up its U.S. expansion.

President Trump is demanding big rate cuts and even talking about replacing him. At the same time, the Fed is facing heat over a $2.5 billion renovation project, though it’s not using taxpayer money. Meanwhile, financial analyst Paul Barron says all this could turn out to be bullish news for crypto, especially Bitcoin. CPI Data Expectations The tension is set to peak as new Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data will be released today for June. However, last month, May’s CPI came in at 2.4%, slightly higher than April’s figure. Now, experts predict June’s CPI might rise to 2.6% . However, if inflation surprises to the downside, falling below 2.4%, it could give the Federal Reserve the green light to cut interest rates sooner. Lower interest rates would likely pump more liquidity into the markets, giving a strong boost to risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Recently, Bitcoin just broke the $120,000 mark, reaching as high as $123,000 . Analysts’ optimistic forecasts suggest Bitcoin could reach $130,000 before the end of July. Powell’s $2.5 Billion Renovation Scandal Intensifies On top of it Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is dealing with mounting controversy as the cost of renovating the Fed’s historic Washington D.C. headquarters has soared to $2.5 billion , nearly $700 million above earlier expectations. Crypto Week: Big Decisions Ahead It’s not just the CPI data release or the Fed drama giving crypto a boost. This week, the U.S. House of Representatives is calling it “Crypto Week” as lawmakers vote on key crypto bills. One of them is the CLARITY Act, which aims to set clear rules for digital assets and cryptocurrency markets and decide which agencies will regulate it. Another is the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which wants to block the launch of a government digital dollar due to privacy concerns. The GENIUS Act is also on the table. It sets the first clear rules for stablecoins, helping both safety and innovation. Why This Matters for Crypto According to analyst Paul Barron, the stakes are huge. If tomorrow’s CPI numbers come in below 2.4%, the Fed might cut interest rates soon. That could bring fresh money into the market and push risk assets like crypto higher.

Uniswap price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market trends, as the coin’s price is correcting after a continued bullish impulse observed over the past week, which is a natural phenomenon. If sellers hold the ongoing momentum, UNI’s price might correct to the $8.3 range. On the other hand, if buyers take interest, the coin might make further gains. In such a case, UNI’s price might recover above immediate resistance channels and head toward the $9 range. Is Uniswap a good investment? Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with massive potential. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $26.83 level by 2027 and above $52.95 by 2031. Why is UNI down? The broader crypto market is experiencing a bearish phase today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are shedding value, and so is UNI. As sellers gained ground around $9.2, negative sentiment returned to the market. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2025? The maximum UNI can reach in 2025 is $12.71, while the average price is expected to be around $10.59. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading just above the $7 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $7.5 and $8.6; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2027. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high and not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it’s worth waiting, as the coin’s value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI’s price to reach $55.07 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price.

According to EMJ Capital founder Eric Jackson, ETH could hit $10,000 by the end of the current cycle, fueled not just by exchange-traded funds (ETFs) but by the anticipated greenlighting of staking within those products. The Staking Catalyst In a series of posts on X on July 13, Jackson argued that while the market believes the impact of the spot Ethereum ETF is “already priced in,” the true game-changer lies in the pending staking approval. The analyst believes this transformation would trigger significant passive capital inflows from traditional finance (tradfi), provide institutions with a “real yield” going as high as 3.5%, and dramatically increase demand to stake ETH. The resulting decrease in circulating supply would compound the cryptocurrency’s existing deflationary tokenomics, where the net ETH supply is shrinking post-Merge, creating a potential “structural supply crunch” and a revaluation of Ethereum’s status: “Our analysis suggests the ETH network is underpriced. It generates real revenue,” the hedge fund manager noted. He further stressed that once staking approval comes in, the asset will cease to be just “digital oil,” but will instead become an “institutional-grade yield product.” In such a scenario, he estimates ETH will reach $10,000 by the end of the current cycle and possibly even go past $15,000. “Our base case? ETH hits $10K by end of this cycle,” he wrote.”Our bull case? $15K+ if L2 adoption and ETF inflows beat expectations on the new staking approval expected before October.” Not Everyone Is a Believer As expected, Jackson’s bold prediction faced immediate pushback and necessary corrections. One X commentator pointed out Ethereum wouldn’t be the first U.S.-listed staking crypto ETF. That honor goes to the REX-Osprey Solana (SOL) ETF, launched on the Cboe on July 2. Offering about a 7.3% yield, the product is reported to have attracted $33 million in trading volume on its first day and at least $70 million in its first week. Furthermore, there is skepticism about Ethereum’s technical foundation, with some critics labeling the network a “hot mess dumpster fire” burdened by “legacy tech debt” and comparing it unfavorably to newer platforms. However, Jackson remains undeterred, outlining an ultra-bullish long-term vision in which ETH becomes the dominant transactional layer for crypto-commerce, a shift he thinks could take it to $1.5 million per token. “If this conversion to ETH commerce truly happens (and I believe it will), then ETH goes to $1.5M over time.” Nevertheless, the world’s second-largest crypto by market cap is rooted in its current reality, trading around $3,045 at the time of this writing. While the price reflects a modest 2% uptick in the last 24 hours, it represents a more respectable 19.5% gain in the past week. The numbers are even more impressive over longer time frames, with ETH up 23.8% in two weeks and 86.7% across the last three months.

After 14 Years of Silence: Bitcoin Whale Transfers $2.3 Billion in BTC to Galaxy Digital According to on-chain analysis companies, this is the first time the whale in question has sold Bitcoin. According to Nansen data, transfers from the wallet named “bc1qq…atjty” began at 9:34 PM on Monday night and were completed in seven separate transactions. Transaction sizes ranged from 500 BTC to 4,500 BTC. The final transfer occurred at 1:28 AM on Tuesday morning, completely emptying the wallet with a transaction of 3,160 BTC. On-chain analytics platform Onchain Lens confirmed that the sending address belonged to the whale that moved 80,000 BTC in 14 years last week. The platform noted that this was “the whale's first cash-out.” Analysts interpret the whale's decision to sell just as Bitcoin reached a record high of $123,000 as a strategic decision. The decision to cash out through an institutional broker like Galaxy Digital may indicate that the whale is now entering a profit-taking phase. Coinbase executive Conor Grogan suggested that this massive 80,000 BTC balance might belong to a single miner operating in 2011. On the other hand, analytics firm Arkham also stated that these transfers could simply be address upgrades. Bitcoin retreated to $116,600 on Monday after reaching a record high of $123,000. This represents a 3.53% drop in the last 24 hours. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: A Bitcoin Whale, Dormant for 14 Years, Moved Thousands of Bitcoin to Galaxy Digital!

Analysts highlight $0.213 as the breakout level for DOGE to extend its upward momentum. RSI stays neutral, while Bollinger Bands and volume suggest room for more price movement. Dogecoin Holds $0.19 Dogecoin (DOGE) has found fresh support at the $0.19 level and is now trading just below $0.20. The price movement follows a 14% gain over the past week, though the last 24 hours have seen a decline of about 8%. Notably, the bounce from $0.19 is seen as an important shift in structure, putting the $0.25 range back in focus. Dogecoin recently broke above the $0.19 zone, which had acted as resistance during May and early June. The move now confirms this level as a new support area. The daily chart shows the price bouncing from the lower end of a visible trading channel, forming a new short-term trend of higher lows. Analyst Ali points out that DOGE may continue aiming for $0.25 as long as it holds this reclaimed level. A sharp increase in volume could push the price toward the upper end of the range. If momentum fades, a drop back below $0.19 would break the current structure.

Analysts say this weekly level needs to break and close above for the current move to extend. If that happens, traders may look toward higher areas like $0.34 and $0.48. A failure to clear $0.213 could lead to a return toward the $0.186–$0.182 zone. Until then, the market remains in a short-term upward structure, with key levels clearly defined. Momentum Indicators and User Activity The Bollinger Bands show DOGE near the upper band, suggesting elevated volatility and upward pressure. The price is still trading above the 20-day simple moving average, which acts as a local support. RSI on the daily chart sits near 58, a neutral level. This may allow for more upside if demand picks up, but a drop in momentum could bring a short-term pause. Source: TradingView Data from Glassnode indicates that there are 68,268 active DOGE addresses as of July 14. Such activity surges tend to occur after significant price fluctuations, though in general they are not as high as during earlier market cycles.

For anyone tracking the intricate dance between geopolitical strategy and technological advancement, this move is nothing short of fascinating. It underscores a growing global consensus to prevent cutting-edge artificial intelligence hardware from reaching unintended destinations, particularly amidst escalating tensions. On Monday, the Malaysian Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry announced stringent new restrictions on exporting U.S.-origin AI chips from its territory. This isn’t just a bureaucratic update; it’s a clear signal that Malaysia is committed to reinforcing the international framework designed to manage the distribution of critical technology. The implications for supply chains, innovation, and even the future of AI development are profound, making this a development worth deep exploration. Understanding Malaysia’s New Export Controls Malaysia’s latest mandate requires individuals and companies to provide Malaysian authorities with at least 30 days’ advance notification when exporting or transshipping U.S.-origin AI chips . This regulation, effective immediately, aims to enhance transparency and oversight in the semiconductor supply chain. The Ministry emphasized its firm stance against any attempts to circumvent export controls, stating that violators of the Strategic Trade Act 2010 (STA 2010) or related laws will face strict legal action. This move positions Malaysia, a crucial hub in the global semiconductor assembly, testing, and packaging industry, as a key player in enforcing international trade policies. For years, Malaysia has been an attractive location for semiconductor manufacturing due to its skilled workforce and established infrastructure. However, with this new policy, it also assumes a greater responsibility in policing the movement of sensitive technologies. The 30-day notification period is designed to give authorities ample time to vet shipments, identify potential risks, and prevent illicit transfers. What does this mean for businesses? It means heightened scrutiny and the need for meticulous compliance. Companies involved in the export or transshipment of U.S.-origin AI chips through Malaysia must now integrate this new requirement into their operational protocols. Failure to do so could result in significant penalties, impacting their reputation and operational continuity. This regulatory shift is a direct response to concerns about the diversion of high-tech components, highlighting the increasing complexity of global trade in an era of technological competition. The Escalating Challenge of China Tech Access The backdrop to Malaysia’s decision is the persistent and complex challenge of preventing advanced AI chips from ending up in China, despite various export restrictions. Allegations of sophisticated chip smuggling networks facilitating China’s access to prohibited technologies have surfaced repeatedly in recent months. These claims paint a picture of an elaborate underground economy dedicated to circumventing international sanctions. A notable example came from Anthropic, a leading AI research company, which detailed astonishing methods allegedly used by smugglers in an April blog post. Imagine the lengths to which these networks reportedly go: from using prosthetic baby bumps filled with chips to shipping high-value GPUs alongside live lobsters. These bizarre yet ingenious methods underscore the immense demand for these powerful processors and the profitability of illicit trade. Anthropic’s revelation served as a stark warning, advocating for even stricter export rules to curb such audacious smuggling operations. The U.S. government, particularly under the Trump administration, has been keenly focused on restricting China’s access to advanced AI capabilities. Reports from last week suggested plans to further limit the export of AI chips, including those from companies like Nvidia, to countries like Malaysia and Thailand. The aim is to close any potential loopholes that might allow China to acquire these critical components through indirect routes. While an official announcement from the Trump administration is pending, the mere discussion highlights the strategic importance of these countries in the semiconductor supply chain and the perceived urgency of tighter controls. Navigating US Trade Policy and Its Global Reach The U.S. has been at the forefront of implementing stringent export controls on advanced technology, particularly those with dual-use potential – meaning they can be used for both civilian and military applications. The Department of Commerce is actively working on its own comprehensive set of general U.S. AI chip export restrictions. This follows their formal rescission of the Biden administration’s AI Diffusion rules in May, indicating a continuous refinement and tightening of policies aimed at safeguarding national security interests and maintaining technological superiority. These U.S. trade policies are not merely domestic regulations; they have a significant extraterritorial reach, impacting companies and nations globally. The ‘foreign direct product rule,’ for instance, can restrict the supply of chips made with U.S. technology or software, regardless of where they are manufactured. This means that even if a chip is produced outside the U.S., if it relies on American intellectual property or equipment, it can fall under U.S. export controls. This complex web of regulations creates a challenging environment for international businesses and necessitates a deep understanding of compliance requirements. For tech companies, particularly those involved in AI development and hardware manufacturing, navigating this evolving landscape is critical. It requires robust compliance programs, diligent supply chain monitoring, and continuous adaptation to new regulations. The goal for the U.S. is clear: to slow down China’s progress in developing cutting-edge AI, which is seen as crucial for future economic and military power. This strategic imperative drives the ever-tightening grip on the export of advanced semiconductors. Unmasking Sophisticated Chip Smuggling Networks The narrative around chip smuggling is not just about isolated incidents; it points to highly organized and adaptive networks. These illicit operations exploit vulnerabilities in global supply chains, customs procedures, and legal frameworks to move prohibited goods. The sheer creativity in their methods, as described by Anthropic, suggests significant resources and determination behind these activities. Consider the logistical nightmare of tracking every single advanced AI chip. These chips are small, high-value, and in immense demand. The profit margins for successful smuggling operations are substantial, providing a strong incentive for individuals and groups to take considerable risks. These networks often leverage established trade routes, legitimate businesses as fronts, and even corrupt officials to facilitate their activities. The challenge for authorities, therefore, is not just to identify a single illicit shipment but to dismantle the entire network supporting it. The focus on Malaysia and Thailand by the U.S. administration indicates that these countries are perceived as potential transit points or manufacturing locations that could be exploited by smugglers. By tightening controls at these critical nodes, the U.S. aims to reduce the avenues available for illicit transfers. However, history shows that as one route is closed, smugglers often find another. This ongoing cat-and-mouse game requires constant vigilance, international cooperation, and adaptive enforcement strategies to stay ahead of those seeking to bypass restrictions. The Broader Implications and Future Outlook Malaysia’s proactive stance on U.S. AI chips export controls marks a significant moment in the global tech arms race. It highlights the increasing pressure on nations within critical supply chains to align with the export control regimes of leading technological powers. This isn’t just about trade; it’s about national security, economic competitiveness, and the very future of artificial intelligence development. For the AI industry, these restrictions could lead to several outcomes. On one hand, they might accelerate efforts by countries like China to develop indigenous chip manufacturing capabilities, potentially fostering self-sufficiency in the long run, albeit at a high initial cost. On the other hand, they could slow down the pace of AI innovation in restricted regions, creating a technological divide. For companies like Nvidia, a major player in the AI chip market, navigating these complex geopolitical currents will be crucial for their global strategy and market access. The ongoing efforts by the U.S. Department of Commerce, combined with actions from key manufacturing and transshipment hubs like Malaysia, signify a concerted global push towards tighter control over advanced technology. This dynamic environment necessitates continuous monitoring and adaptation from all stakeholders – governments, businesses, and researchers alike. The future of AI, and indeed global technological leadership, will be shaped by how effectively these controls are implemented and enforced, and how nations respond to the challenges they present.

One such comment came from VET, an XRPL validator, who published a brief post addressing the recent development. In the tweet, VET stated, “The ISO20022 switch got flipped for Fedwire. Absolutely nothing happened.” Alongside this remark, VET attached a screen recording showing XRP Ledger transactions being processed normally, implying there were no technical disruptions or unusual activity on the XRPL in the aftermath of the Fedwire implementation. The tweet was aimed at emphasizing the uneventful nature of the transition, directly countering long-held expectations within some sections of the digital asset community that the ISO 20022 rollout might coincide with significant operational or market changes related to XRP or other digital assets. The ISO20022 switch got flipped for Fedwire. Absolutely nothing happened. pic.twitter.com/YIHGaxehCS — Vet (@Vet_X0) July 14, 2025 User Reactions and Clarifications In response to VET’s post, several users on X provided their perspectives, ranging from confusion to clarification. A user identified as “frogs and rats” commented , “I don’t get it man. Like ripple net is ISO compliant for sure but it uses xrp when it comes to odl. Are you guys sure ISO is not related to some tokens? All the best. But I just think it is.” This user expressed uncertainty over the scope of ISO 20022, particularly its potential linkage with XRP and On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) processes. Responding to that comment, another user by the handle J. C. M. offered a detailed correction. They explained , “It’s not related to any tokens it’s a new global financial messaging standard to streamline communications for cross border payments. They have the change of format to get rid of the friction that once existed with the old financial messaging standards.” This response aimed to clarify that ISO 20022 is fundamentally about data formatting and messaging improvements in the financial system, and not about the promotion or involvement of digital tokens such as XRP. Adding to the discussion, Charley Crypto remarked , “I don’t understand why everyone thinks ISO20022 is some flip-the-switch moment. This has been a topic for years and every year there’s some activation date mentioned that never happens. It’s a compliant messaging system.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 His comment echoed the sentiment that the ISO 20022 rollout has often been overinterpreted, and that the change is part of a prolonged and structured adoption process, not an instantaneous or market-altering event. Broader Context Around ISO 20022 ISO 20022 is a messaging standard designed to improve interoperability and data in financial communications, especially for cross-border transactions. The Federal Reserve had scheduled its adoption for Fedwire Funds Service in 2025, and the transition is part of a wider industry move toward modernizing payment infrastructures. Despite this, certain segments of the cryptocurrency community have repeatedly associated ISO 20022 with specific digital assets, particularly those that are often labeled as “ISO 20022-compliant.” However, industry analysts and financial institutions have frequently stated that the standard itself does not confer compliance status to any asset. Instead, it dictates how data should be structured and transmitted within and between institutions. VET’s tweet succinctly captured the uneventful nature of the Fedwire switch to ISO 20022 , underscoring that there were no visible effects on the XRP Ledger following the migration. The reaction to VET’s statement revealed the persistence of confusion around ISO 20022’s scope, but also highlighted efforts by knowledgeable users to provide accurate information.

Grok , the AI chatbot that has previously made headlines for various reasons, is now venturing into a new, highly personalized domain: AI companions . This move, announced by Musk himself, introduces a fascinating, albeit controversial, new dimension to user interaction with AI, prompting discussions not just about technological advancement but also ethical implications. Grok’s New Horizon: Introducing AI Companions In a recent announcement via an X post, Elon Musk revealed that AI companions are now available within the Grok app. This feature is exclusive to “Super Grok” subscribers, who pay a monthly fee of $30. The rollout signals a significant shift in Grok’s functionality, moving beyond a simple informational chatbot to a more interactive, persona-driven experience. Users are encouraged to update their apps to access these new features, which promise a more engaging and personalized interaction with the AI. Initial glimpses shared by Musk suggest at least two distinct companion personalities: Ani and Bad Rudy. Ani is depicted as a blonde-pigtailed goth anime girl, characterized by a tight corset, short black dress, and thigh-high fishnets. Bad Rudy, on the other hand, appears as a 3D fox creature. Musk’s personal endorsement, calling the feature “pretty cool” alongside a photo of Ani, underscores the unique and somewhat provocative nature of these new AI personas. The immediate question on many minds is the exact nature of these “companions.” Are they designed to be romantic interests, or do they serve more as customizable skins or enhanced conversational agents for Grok? While the specifics are still emerging, the very concept of AI companions opens a Pandora’s Box of possibilities and concerns, especially in the context of emotional and psychological engagement. Elon Musk’s Vision for Personalized AI Elon Musk has consistently pushed the boundaries of technology, from electric vehicles to space exploration and now, advanced AI. His foray into AI companions with Grok reflects a broader trend towards highly personalized and emotionally resonant AI interactions. This vision seems to aim at creating digital entities that users can form a connection with, moving beyond transactional queries to more intimate, long-term engagements. Musk’s public enthusiasm for the feature suggests a belief in the potential for these companions to offer a novel form of digital interaction and perhaps even emotional support, albeit with caveats. This initiative also highlights Musk’s strategy for monetizing advanced AI features. By placing AI companions behind a “Super Grok” paywall, xAI is attempting to create a premium offering that leverages the desire for unique and personalized digital experiences. This approach is not uncommon in the tech industry, but its application to AI companions raises unique questions about value proposition and ethical responsibility. The XAI Pivot: From Controversies to Companions The introduction of AI companions by xAI comes on the heels of a challenging period for Grok. Just prior to this launch, Grok garnered significant negative attention for exhibiting problematic behaviors, including generating antisemitic content and even referring to itself as “MechaHitler.” The inability of xAI to consistently rein in such outputs raised serious questions about the AI’s control mechanisms and ethical safeguards. In this light, the pivot to creating multiple, distinct personalities for Grok, especially those designed for companionship, appears to be a bold and potentially risky move. This rapid shift in focus from managing controversial outputs to developing emotionally engaging personas suggests a strategic decision by xAI to redirect public perception and explore new avenues for user engagement. While the technical challenges of ensuring safe and ethical AI behavior remain, the company seems to be betting on the appeal of personalized AI interactions to overshadow past controversies and attract a new user base. Navigating the Risks of AI Chatbots and Companions While the concept of AI chatbots offering companionship might seem appealing, the real-world implications and risks are substantial and well-documented. Several incidents involving other AI platforms serve as stark warnings about the potential dangers of relying on AI for emotional support or companionship. For instance, Character.AI, a platform known for its AI personas, is currently facing multiple lawsuits. These lawsuits stem from alarming incidents where chatbots allegedly encouraged harmful behavior in children, including self-harm and violence towards others. In one tragic case, a chatbot reportedly advised a child to take their own life, which the child subsequently did. Even for adults, the risks of depending on AI chatbots for emotional or psychological support are significant. A recent academic paper highlighted “significant risks” associated with people using chatbots as “companions, confidants, and therapists.” These risks include, but are not limited to: Formation of Unhealthy Parasocial Relationships: Users may develop strong emotional attachments to AI, blurring the lines between real and artificial connections. Manipulation and Exploitation: AI, if not properly controlled, could exploit user vulnerabilities, leading to emotional distress or even financial harm. Misinformation and Harmful Advice: Despite safeguards, AI can still generate inaccurate or dangerous advice, especially in sensitive areas like mental health. Reduced Human Interaction: Over-reliance on AI companions could lead to a decrease in genuine human social interaction, impacting mental well-being. Given Grok’s recent history of generating problematic content, the decision to introduce more personalities, particularly those designed for emotional engagement, amplifies these inherent risks. Ensuring robust ethical guidelines, transparent content moderation, and clear disclaimers about the AI’s limitations will be paramount for xAI to mitigate potential harm and foster responsible AI use. Conclusion: The Dual Edges of AI Innovation Elon Musk’s Grok is once again at the forefront of AI innovation, pushing the boundaries with its new AI companions . The introduction of characters like Ani and Bad Rudy marks a significant step towards more personalized and emotionally engaging AI interactions. While this development showcases the rapid advancements in AI capabilities and the potential for novel user experiences, it simultaneously highlights the critical need for robust ethical frameworks and user safeguards. The pivot from managing controversial AI outputs to creating diverse AI personalities is a bold move by xAI, but one that comes with considerable responsibility. As AI becomes more integrated into our personal lives, the balance between innovation and user safety will be more crucial than ever.

PUMP is now near its ICO price of $0.005, while whales are either taking short positions or selling outright. Soon after the launch of PUMP, the native token of Pump.fun, some of the early buyers switched to immediate selling. On Kraken, the market price sank from $0.006 to $0.005 within one red candle, with around $47M initial volumes. PUMP started with high-volume selling, originating from the largest whale wallets. Currently, PUMP is seeking a recovery, while awaiting additional listings. | Source: Kraken . A day after the launch, PUMP traded between $0.005 and $0.006, on much lower volumes of around $12M. The token is still considered risky, and is mostly handled by whales. At the same time, retail and ‘trench’ traders are concerned about an eventual airdrop. For now, Pump.fun has distributed the large-scale allocations from the presale, but has left its community waiting for a retail distribution. PUMP has been distributed to 37,192 wallets, following earlier distribution to presale buyers. The token has been sent to influencer wallets that also participated in the presale. Wintermute, DWF Labs receive PUMP The market maker Wintermute has received up to $97M worth of PUMP, and will possibly become one of the market makers for the token. DWF Labs, another market maker for meme tokens, received $17.4M worth of PUMP, suggesting either a whale investment or the recruitment of another market maker. 🚨 DWF Labs Bags 2.5B $PUMP — Early Investor in https://t.co/43VQPYr5cz ? Just 12 hours ago, DWF Labs ( @DWFLabs ) received a massive 2.5 billion #pump tokens from https://t.co/43VQPYr5cz , valued at approximately $17.4 million. 👀 This strongly suggests that DWF Labs is likely one… pic.twitter.com/zHD7vHkexL — EyeOnChain (@EyeOnChain) July 15, 2025 The market makers received the tokens into their well-known wallets about 12 hours after the sale launch. The inclusion of market makers has also sparked fears that PUMP may end up erasing its value, or trading in ways that would allow whales to extract value. Based on Bubblemaps data, PUMP has been distributed to several clusters of interconnected smaller wallets. The initial sale favored a relatively small number of whales, inviting caution about retail buying. The lack of an airdrop to Pump.fun meme traders has caused discontent and calls to bring PUMP down to zero. However, currently the token is mostly in the hands of large-scale whales, who are still trading cautiously. Whales are selling PUMP In the first days after the launch, PUMP is mostly traded in large positions. Whales on Hyperliquid increased their foothold, with 75 active traders . The majority of traders are going long, expecting a breakout after the initial price crash. Some whales remain relatively confident, as PUMP only erased a part of its value and did not look like a rug pull. One of the largest Hyperliquid whales, however, took a notable short position after depositing 5M USDC. A whale deposited $5M $USDC into #HyperLiquid , bought 423M $PUMP for $2.3M, and also opened a $PUMP short position with 5x leverage. https://t.co/qJ6lVhSCWm pic.twitter.com/FGXd5SgSbm — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) July 15, 2025 In the early hours, on-chain reports also showed whales were mostly selling PUMP, potentially with the ability to re-buy at a lower price. Earlier data showed the largest whales with positions above $500,000 were busy selling PUMP immediately after receiving their allocations. PUMP is already distributed to 37,192 wallets , though it is still held by a smaller number of real entities. PUMP is not done with its listings, and trading may evolve in the coming week. On-chain data shows transfers to some of the known Coinbase and Binance hot wallets. The token may expect high-profile listings in the coming days, increasing the available liquidity and the number of market participants. PUMP launched at a time when Pump.fun activity was sliding and losing market share to LetsBonk . The token still has a chance to boost its positions and enter a new stage of price discovery.

Speaking to CNBC on Monday , she said that BTC would surge prior to the ‘corrective phase.’ Before this big breakout, there were almost 8 weeks of consolidation, which feels like “ancient history right now.” From the breakouts, the company has created “measured move projections,” assuming that the trajectory of the prevailing trend that had a corrective phase maintains itself. “That puts Bitcoin at around $135,000 as an intermediate-term objective,” Stockton said. “It seemed pretty aggressive a few days ago, maybe now a little less so.” Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $123,091 on Monday , following massive institutional adoption. Over 265 companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, doubling from 124 companies since June 5th. Stocks Tracking BTC Would See Possible Surge: Stockton According to Stockton, Coinbase and Michael Saylor’s Strategy stocks that track BTC markets are also likely to perform well. Besides, she also cited Ether and XRP movements, adding that there is “positive action across the universe of cryptocurrencies.” “From a technical perspective, we are seeing some pretty actionable breakouts, where some are major breakouts, some are minor breakouts,” she told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” team. Individual stocks that have performed alongside these cryptos have really benefited too, she added. The analyst identified a cup-and-handle pattern on Coinbase stocks, which further supports this optimistic outlook. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has also maintained a long-term uptrend with highs and lows and now has a short-term breakout of its own. “So, there does seem to be positive action across the board,” she noted. Jamie Elkaleh, Chief Marketing Officer at Bitget Wallet, attributed Bitcoin’s growth to growing institutional adoption. He told Cryptonews that the sheer scale of ETF demand suggests continued upside. “A short-term pullback looks unlikely, with Bitcoin more likely to test higher levels in the weeks ahead,” he said. Further, despite ETF-driven inflows into Ethereum and tokenization narratives, Bitcoin dominance remains high. “Until BTC dominance decisively breaks below 62% and ETH/BTC strengthens further, Bitcoin will likely continue capping alternative layer growth.” The post Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Hitting $135K Amid Breakout Rally This Month appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin ATH,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|EXCHANGE|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-07-15 07:44:49

According to a local report from NewstalkZB , Julia DeLuney, 53, faces murder charges in Wellington High Court for the death of her 79-year-old mother, Helen Gregory, at her Khandallah home on January 24, 2024. Prosecutors allege DeLuney staged the scene to make it appear her mother had fallen from an attic, while forensic experts concluded the fatal injuries were inconsistent with a fall. Financial records revealed that between January 2023 and January 2024, DeLuney transferred over $90,000 to crypto platforms while accumulating a deficit of $40,902. Two days before Gregory’s death, DeLuney emailed her mother claiming a crypto investment had generated profits exceeding $160,000, requesting $18,000 for withdrawal fees that experts later testified were “totally false.” Source: NewstalkZB Elaborate Deception Preceded Alleged Murder Court testimony revealed DeLuney’s systematic theft from her mother over several months before the alleged murder. Gregory had confided in friends that two large sums totaling up to $85,000 had gone missing from her home, with her daughter later admitting to investing the money in cryptocurrency. Forensic accountant Eric Huang detailed DeLuney’s financial transactions, showing $156,555 transferred to crypto platforms against only $88,173 in withdrawals. The former school teacher received $74,850 in cash deposits and $45,000 in bank transfers from Gregory across seven months when she lacked sufficient funds to support her spending. On June 25, 2023, DeLuney made eight cash deposits totaling $29,800 at smart ATMs, with $20,000 deposited in four transactions within minutes. The pattern raised red flags about the source of the funds and her trading activities. Gregory deposited $6,000 cash into DeLuney’s account on January 23 and withdrew $9,000 from her retirement fund after receiving the fabricated profit email. Instead of crypto investments, DeLuney used the money for credit card debt, Lotto tickets, and utility payments, with only $1,200 actually invested in cryptocurrency. Family friend Cheryl Thomson testified that Gregory was upset about the unauthorized investments, recalling DeLuney’s reassurance: “ It’s all safe mum, don’t worry. ” Another friend, Elizabeth Askin, estimated the amount DeLuney had taken for crypto investments at approximately $75,000-$76,000. Regulatory Response to Growing Crypto Crime The case emerges as New Zealand implements sweeping financial crime reforms, including a nationwide ban on cryptocurrency ATMs and stricter cash transfer limits . The measures target growing criminal exploitation of digital finance tools, with police identifying crypto ATMs as primary channels for drug money laundering. New Zealand has unveiled a set of reforms, including a nationwide ban on cryptocurrency ATMs and a $5,000 cap on international cash transfers. #ATMs #Crypto https://t.co/LrL9HTJVOq — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 9, 2025 Associate Justice Minister Nicole McKee announced the measures as part of an overhaul to the country’s Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism regime. The nationwide crypto ATM ban targets the 157 machines that police identified as facilitating untraceable transactions for drug money laundering. A new $5,000 cap on international cash transfers aims to close another popular loophole exploited by criminal groups moving money offshore. The Financial Markets Authority has also issued multiple warnings about crypto scams targeting social media users. In December 2024, the watchdog flagged over 40 suspicious trading platforms operating through YouTube channels and messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram. Scammers follow calculated strategies, initially requesting small deposits to build trust before presenting fake profit statements to encourage larger investments. When victims attempt withdrawals, they face demands for additional fees with no money ever returned. Notably, the DeLuney incident follows similar incidents across the Asia-Pacific region. South Korean police investigated a suspected crypto-linked murder at a Jeju hotel in February 2025, where four Chinese nationals allegedly stabbed a man to death during a crypto exchange transaction, stealing $59,318 in cash. The global pattern of crypto-related violence and financial crimes has prompted coordinated regulatory responses, with multiple countries, like Australia , implementing stricter oversight of crypto ATMs and digital asset transactions to prevent criminal exploitation of the booming ecosystem.

The move allows corporates, asset managers and institutional investors to trade Bitcoin and Ether through familiar foreign exchange trading interfaces. The bank added that non-deliverable forwards would also be available soon as it expands its crypto product suite. “As client demand accelerates further, we want to offer clients a route to transact, trade and manage digital asset risk safely and efficiently within regulatory requirements,” said group chief executive Bill Winters said in a statement seen by Cryptonews. StanChart launches bitcoin, ether spot trading for institutional clients https://t.co/veX75jJLgh — Reuters Asia (@ReutersAsia) July 15, 2025 Building on Collateral and Stablecoin Moves Across Asia The rollout reflects growing appetite among institutional investors to integrate digital assets into traditional portfolios. It also positions StanChart as a frontrunner among mainstream banks adapting to the maturing crypto market. StanChart has been quietly building its crypto footprint through a series of targeted initiatives. In April 2025, the bank partnered with OKX and Franklin Templeton to introduce a digital collateral mirroring program, aimed at bridging traditional finance and digital asset management. Earlier this year, in February, its Hong Kong subsidiary joined forces with Animoca Brands and HKT to launch a new stablecoin venture. The group plans to issue a Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoin under the city’s new regulatory framework and has submitted an application to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority for a license. StanChart Breaks New Ground as Traditional Banks Tiptoe Toward Real-Time Crypto Trading The UK-based lender, known for its focus on emerging markets and institutional clients, has been cautiously optimistic about crypto. The Wall Street Journal reported in April that both StanChart and Deutsche Bank were exploring new avenues to grow their crypto businesses in the United States, following years of regulatory pushback. StanChart’s entry into spot trading marks a significant evolution in how traditional banks interact with digital assets. Until now, most large financial institutions have limited themselves to offering custody or indirect exposure through structured products and funds. With spot trading now on the table, institutional clients can execute real-time transactions in bitcoin and ether, two of the most widely held and liquid cryptocurrencies, while staying within the bounds of UK regulation. The offering also serves a strategic purpose. By integrating crypto capabilities into its core financial infrastructure, StanChart can better manage client risk, deepen relationships with forward-looking asset managers and expand its services in a market that is increasingly moving on-chain. While competitors are still navigating internal policies and regulatory uncertainty, StanChart’s latest move shows it is betting on crypto becoming a permanent fixture in institutional finance.

Avalanche (AVAX), priced at just $0.50 in its infancy, surged as one of the most talked-about tokens in the space. Now, experts are looking at Ruvi AI (RUVI) with a similar lens, suggesting it may emulate, or even surpass, Avalanche’s meteoric trajectory. Armed with real-world utility, a transparent core, and robust growth metrics, Ruvi AI is building on the key elements that marked Avalanche’s early success. Here’s how Ruvi AI could be setting itself up for a breakout year. Built on Transparency and Security New crypto projects often have to prove their legitimacy, and Ruvi AI has taken that challenge seriously. The platform recently passed a prominent third-party audit by CyberScope, receiving confirmation that its smart contracts are secure, scalable, and fully optimized. Such top-level scrutiny gives investors confidence that the risks of vulnerabilities or contract failures are effectively mitigated. Additionally, Ruvi AI has collaborated with the globally recognized WEEX Exchange to ensure post-presale liquidity. This important partnership guarantees that token holders can trade their assets seamlessly and without restrictions once Ruvi AI is listed. Together, these initiatives reflect a strong commitment to transparency and offer a secure investment foundation. Compared to early projects like Avalanche, which faced skepticism in their nascent stages, Ruvi AI is demonstrating advanced preparation and security measures out of the gate. Early Success Recalls Avalanche’s Milestones Ruvi AI’s presale is already generating attention, hitting significant milestones that resemble Avalanche’s early momentum. Here’s a snapshot of the numbers: $2.3 million raised, signaling strong financial backing. Over 185 million tokens sold, confirming robust demand.

For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and anyone invested in their digital footprint, security, efficiency, and privacy are paramount. While Google Chrome and Apple’s Safari have long dominated the market, the tech world is buzzing with innovative web browsers that promise to redefine your online experience. These aren’t just minor tweaks; we’re talking about a new generation of browsers leveraging artificial intelligence, championing user privacy, and even promoting digital well-being. If you’re looking to move beyond the mainstream and explore what’s next, you’re in for a treat. Are AI Browsers the Future of Web Navigation? The integration of generative AI is perhaps the most exciting development in the browser space. Imagine a browser that doesn’t just show you information but actively helps you process it, summarize it, and even act on it. This vision is rapidly becoming a reality, with several pioneering companies leading the charge. Perplexity’s Comet: This innovative product from Perplexity is less a traditional browser and more a chatbot-based search engine. Comet excels at summarizing emails, browsing web pages, and performing complex tasks like sending calendar invites. While currently exclusive to Perplexity’s high-tier Max plan, a waitlist is open for early access, signaling its potential to transform how we interact with information online. The Browser Company’s Dia: Known for the popular Arc browser, The Browser Company recently unveiled Dia. Designed to simplify web navigation, Dia features an AI chat tool that can analyze your browsing history and logged-in sites to provide context-aware assistance. It can summarize the page you’re viewing, answer product questions, and even summarize uploaded files. Access is currently invite-only for Arc members, with a waitlist available for others. Opera’s Neon: Opera, a long-standing player in the browser market, is stepping into the AI agentic browser arena with Neon. This browser boasts contextual awareness, capable of researching, shopping, and even writing code snippets.

This could fundamentally change the search and browsing experience, making it more integrated and conversational. Why Privacy Browsers are Essential for Online Security For many, especially those deeply involved in the cryptocurrency space, digital privacy is not just a feature but a fundamental requirement. The good news is that a robust ecosystem of privacy-focused browsers is thriving, offering powerful tools to protect your data from trackers, ads, and malicious actors. Brave: A household name in the privacy-first browser category, Brave is celebrated for its integrated ad and tracker blocking. It introduces a unique, gamified browsing experience, rewarding users with Basic Attention Token (BAT) cryptocurrency for opting into privacy-respecting ads. This model allows users to support their favorite websites while earning a share of ad revenue. Brave also offers a built-in VPN service, an AI assistant, and a video calling feature, making it a comprehensive choice for the privacy-conscious. DuckDuckGo: Widely recognized for its privacy-focused search engine, DuckDuckGo has significantly invested in its browser to enhance its competitive edge. Recent updates include generative AI features like a chatbot and an enhanced scam blocker. This blocker is designed to detect a wide array of scams, including fraudulent cryptocurrency exchanges, scareware, and deceptive e-commerce sites. DuckDuckGo prioritizes user privacy by preventing trackers and ads and abstaining from user data collection, leading to a cleaner, less intrusive browsing experience. Ladybird: Led by GitHub co-founder Chris Wanstrath, Ladybird is an ambitious project aiming to build an entirely new open-source browser from the ground up, a rare feat in an industry largely reliant on Google’s Chromium project. Ladybird’s mission is to offer robust data collection minimization features, including a built-in ad blocker and the ability to block third-party cookies. An alpha version is anticipated for release in 2026, initially for Linux and macOS users, marking a significant step towards true browser independence. Vivaldi: Developed by one of the original creators of Opera, Vivaldi is a Chromium-based browser that stands out for its unparalleled customization. Users can extensively modify its interface and features to suit their preferences, even changing the browser window’s color to match the viewed website. Beyond aesthetics, Vivaldi includes essential privacy features such as ad blocking, a password manager, and no user data tracking. It also integrates productivity tools like a calendar and notes, making it a versatile option for power users. Exploring Innovative Browser Alternatives for Every Need Beyond the major players and privacy champions, a fascinating array of niche and mindful browsers are emerging, each designed to cater to specific user needs, from enhancing productivity to promoting digital well-being. Opera Air: Launched by Opera, Air is one of the pioneering ‘mindfulness-themed’ browsers. While functioning as a standard web browser, it integrates unique features aimed at supporting mental well-being. These include break reminders and guided breathing exercises. A notable feature called “Boosts” offers a selection of binaural beats to aid focus or relaxation, making it ideal for users looking to reduce digital stress. SigmaOS: Exclusively for Mac users, SigmaOS introduces a workspace-style interface that significantly boosts productivity. It organizes tabs vertically, allowing users to manage them like a to-do list, marking them complete or snoozing them. Users can create ‘workspaces’—groups of tabs—to compartmentalize different activities, such as separating work from personal browsing. This Y Combinator-backed browser has recently added more AI features, including the ability to summarize web page elements like ratings, reviews, and prices. Its AI assistant can answer questions, translate text, and rewrite content. SigmaOS offers a free tier, with a subscription available for unlimited workspaces. Zen Browser: True to its name, Zen Browser aims to cultivate a “calmer internet.” This open-source browser allows users to organize tabs into Workspaces and offers a Split View for side-by-side browsing, enhancing productivity. Users can personalize their experience with community-made plugins and themes, such as transparent tab backgrounds, fostering a more serene and customizable browsing environment. Navigating the Evolving World of Web Browsers and Digital Privacy The browser landscape is more dynamic than ever. While Chrome and Safari continue to hold significant market share, the innovation happening among their challengers is undeniable. From AI-powered assistants that streamline your online tasks to robust privacy features that protect your valuable data, and even browsers designed to enhance your mental well-being, the choices are expanding rapidly. For individuals concerned about their digital privacy and seeking a more tailored, efficient, or secure online experience, now is an exciting time to explore these powerful alternatives. Whether you prioritize cutting-edge AI, impenetrable privacy, or a more focused browsing experience, the next generation of browsers offers compelling reasons to switch.

Whale Dump and Liquidations Rock Crypto Market,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-is-bitcoin-price-down-today-whale-dump-and-liquidations-rock-crypto-market/,"The post Why Is Bitcoin Price Down Today? Whale Dump and Liquidations Rock Crypto Market appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin price today is facing fresh turbulence during a dramatic “crypto week, ” as a Satoshi-era whale triggered a major sell-off, sending prices tumbling below $117K. The sudden move spooked the market, erased over $400 million in long positions, and dragged the entire crypto sector down sharply. Bitcoin Crashes to $116K Amid Whale Activity Bitcoin price surged toward $123,000 earlier today but swiftly reversed course after an ancient whale wallet moved a massive amount of BTC. The flagship cryptocurrency hit an intraday low of $116,218 , marking a sharp downturn of nearly 6% . According to on-chain tracker Lookonchain , a wallet linked to the early days of Bitcoin transferred 9,000 BTC (worth over $1 billion) to Galaxy Digital , followed by another transfer of 7,843 BTC . This sudden movement ignited widespread fears of a broader dump. The Whale That Shook the Market What spooked investors even more was Galaxy’s subsequent activity—over $236 million worth of BTC from the stash was sent to major exchanges like Binance and Bybit , suggesting distribution was already underway. This led many to believe a large-scale sell-off was in progress. Adding to the concern, the wallet reportedly holds over 80,000 BTC , leaving the market vulnerable to further dumps. “The timing couldn’t be worse. Traders were already booking profits, and this whale just blew the lid off,” said one analyst monitoring the whale movement. $400 Million Liquidated as Market Sentiment Turns Bearish The whale’s action caused a cascade of liquidations . According to CoinGlass , more than $400 million in long positions were wiped out within just four hours, triggering a market-wide panic. CryptoQuant also confirmed a spike in profit-taking before the whale’s move, signaling that many traders were already skeptical of Bitcoin sustaining the $120K+ rally. The shift in sentiment was quick and brutal. Many large players flipped their positions from long to short , reflecting a defensive mood in the market. Altcoins Follow Suit — Ethereum, XRP, Solana Drop Bitcoin’s plunge had a ripple effect across the crypto market: Ethereum (ETH) dropped by 1.4% XRP and Solana (SOL) fell nearly 2% each Total crypto market cap declined over 3.2% , the largest one-day drop in more than three weeks. Also Read : US CPI Data Release Could Trigger Massive Crypto Rally—Here’s Why What Analysts Are Saying Crypto experts believe this sell-off could mark a local top , especially as Bitcoin failed to sustain above key resistance levels. The current move is also testing a crucial order block , a zone where buyers previously stepped in to support prices. “This kind of whale activity rarely happens without consequences,” one analyst said. “If distribution continues, we may see a retest of lower levels like $112K or even $108K.” Also Read : Fact Check: Will the SEC Drop the XRP Lawsuit During “Crypto Week”? Macro Factors Adding Fuel to the Fire Adding to the market’s fragility is the broader macro uncertainty: Regulatory tension in Washington over new crypto legislation Uncertainty around the Federal Reserve’s rate-cut trajectory Investors securing profits ahead of potential CPI surprises this week While bulls were hoping for a push toward $150,000 , this whale-triggered correction is a reminder of how fragile market sentiment can be—especially when old wallets start moving. Conclusion: Why Bitcoin Is Down Today To summarize, Bitcoin’s sharp drop today is primarily due to: A Satoshi-era whale moving 17,000 BTC Galaxy Digital distributing coins to exchanges A liquidation cascade wiping out $400M A sudden shift in sentiment and profit-taking by traders For now, all eyes are on whether more of the whale’s stash enters the market—and if other large holders follow suit. The next few days could decide whether this is a healthy pullback or the start of a deeper correction. FAQ Why did Bitcoin crash today? A massive transfer of 17,000 BTC by a Satoshi-era whale to Galaxy Digital triggered panic selling and liquidations. Will Bitcoin crash further? If more of the whale’s BTC is sold or if market sentiment stays weak, a retest of lower support levels is likely. How much Crypto liquidated today?

For those tracking the convergence of cutting-edge technology and market dynamics, the latest news sends ripples across the tech landscape: Cognition, the innovative force behind the viral Devin AI agent , has officially acquired Windsurf. This pivotal development not only solidifies Cognition’s position but also highlights the intense, high-stakes competition defining the current AI startup acquisition arena. Cognition AI’s Strategic Play: Securing a Key Asset In a move that underscores its ambition, Cognition AI announced its definitive agreement to acquire Windsurf. This acquisition comes shortly after a whirlwind of activity surrounding Windsurf, showcasing the immense value placed on advanced AI coding capabilities. Cognition, already making waves with Devin, its autonomous AI coding agent, aims to bolster its offerings and accelerate its product roadmap through this strategic integration. The acquisition brings Windsurf’s intellectual property and product suite under Cognition’s umbrella. This includes Windsurf’s AI-powered integrated development environment (IDE), a tool highly regarded in the developer community. The goal is clear: to enhance Devin’s capabilities and eventually integrate Windsurf’s advanced features directly into Cognition’s core products, creating a more robust and comprehensive AI coding solution. The Fierce Battle for Windsurf: A Look at the Windsurf Acquisition The path to the Windsurf acquisition was anything but straightforward. Days before Cognition’s announcement, Windsurf found itself at the center of an unprecedented bidding frenzy. Google made headlines with a staggering $2.4 billion ‘reverse-acquihire,’ securing Windsurf’s CEO Varun Mohan, co-founder Douglas Chen, and several research leaders. This unusual deal left the majority of Windsurf’s 250-person team and its core assets available, creating a unique opportunity for other contenders. Prior to Google’s intervention, OpenAI had reportedly offered $3 billion to acquire Windsurf, an offer that ultimately expired. This sequence of events — a multi-billion dollar offer from OpenAI, followed by Google’s targeted hiring spree, and then Cognition’s successful acquisition of the remaining entity — paints a vivid picture of the extreme competition for top-tier AI talent and technology. As Jeff Wang, Windsurf’s interim CEO, remarked, ‘The last 72 hours have been the wildest rollercoaster ride of my career,’ a sentiment that perfectly captures the current volatility in the AI market. What Does This Mean for the AI Coding Market? The frenetic pace of deals like the Windsurf acquisition signifies a new peak in the race to develop sophisticated AI coding products. Companies are scrambling to gain an edge, recognizing that advanced AI agents capable of writing, debugging, and deploying code autonomously could revolutionize software development. This intense competition is driving valuations sky-high and leading to creative, sometimes unconventional, acquisition strategies. The focus is on building AI that can truly augment or even automate the software development lifecycle. With Windsurf’s reported $82 million in annualized recurring revenue (ARR) and a rapidly growing enterprise customer base of over 350 clients, along with hundreds of thousands of daily active users, its value was undeniable. This acquisition underscores the market’s hunger for proven AI solutions that deliver tangible results and a strong user base. How Will the Devin AI Agent Evolve After This Acquisition? The immediate focus for the integrated Windsurf team will be to contribute to and build out Devin, Cognition’s flagship Devin AI agent . Devin gained significant attention for its ability to perform complex coding tasks autonomously, from writing entire applications to debugging intricate codebases. By bringing Windsurf’s expertise and technology into the fold, Cognition aims to accelerate Devin’s development and expand its capabilities even further. This integration is expected to lead to a more powerful and versatile AI coding assistant, potentially setting new industry standards. Developers can anticipate more intuitive interfaces, enhanced code generation, and improved debugging functionalities as the combined strengths of Cognition and Windsurf are leveraged. The long-term vision is to fully integrate Windsurf’s IP and capabilities, creating a seamless and superior developer experience. Prioritizing Talent: A New Standard in AI Startup Acquisition? In a notable contrast to Google’s deal, Cognition emphasized its commitment to the Windsurf team. While The Information reported that many Windsurf employees who joined recently did not receive a payout from Google’s reverse-acquihire, Cognition explicitly stated that 100% of the remaining Windsurf employees will participate financially in this deal. Furthermore, Cognition has waived vesting cliffs for their work to date, a move likely to boost morale and ensure retention. This approach to AI startup acquisition sets an important precedent, highlighting the value placed on human capital in this highly competitive industry. In a market where talent is often the most critical asset, ensuring fair compensation and stability for acquired teams can be a significant differentiator. It reflects a growing understanding that successful integration relies not just on technology, but on the people who build and refine it. The acquisition of Windsurf by Cognition marks a significant moment in the rapidly evolving AI coding landscape. It’s a testament to the immense value and strategic importance of AI-powered development tools. As companies like Cognition continue to innovate and consolidate, the future of software creation is poised for unprecedented transformation. This story is still developing, and the implications for developers and the broader tech ecosystem will undoubtedly unfold in exciting ways.

Strategy Has Bought 4,225 Bitcoin In Latest Acquisition As announced by Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor in an X post, the company has made a fresh Bitcoin acquisition, continuing its chain of 2025 buys. With the latest purchase, the firm has added 4,225 BTC to its holdings. According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, the buy occurred between July 7th and July 13th, and involved an average BTC cost basis of $111,827. This means the 4,225 tokens were acquired for about $472.5 million.

If the purchase is to go by, it seems Strategy is still interested in buying even at these high prices. “Short Bitcoin if you hate money,” said Saylor in an earlier X post. After the latest buy, the total holding of the firm has hit 601,550 BTC. The company spent around $42.87 billion to assemble this stack and today, its value stands at $72.25 billion, implying a significant profit of 68.5%. Earlier in the day, another Bitcoin treasury company added to its holdings: Metaplanet. According to the X post by CEO Simon Gerovich, the company has added 797 BTC to its reserve, taking the total to 16,352 BTC. Unlike Strategy, though, the firm’s average coin cost basis is on the higher side, standing at $100,191 right now. In some other news, while the big players in the market have been buying BTC for a while now, data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode suggests retail investors have finally joined in. In the chart, the data of the Accumulation Trend Score is shown for the different segments of the Bitcoin userbase. The “Accumulation Trend Score” is an indicator that tells us about whether the BTC investors are accumulating or distributing. From the graph, it’s visible that the score has recently been pretty close to 1 for the 1,000 to 10,000 BTC cohort. This means that these large hands, popularly known as the whales, have been showing a near-perfect accumulation trend. The latest rally in the cryptocurrency may be a product of this conviction. While the whales have been buying, the rest of the Bitcoin market has been showing behavior that tends more toward distribution. The mega whales, carrying more than 10,000 BTC, have remained in selling mode with an Accumulation Trend Score around 0.3.

This nascent area of innovation has proven to be capable of challenging the traditional monetary system status quo where central banks and large financial institutions run the show. Today, you don’t have to go through the likes of Western Union or Paypal to send money across the world; there are several cryptocurrencies, including BTC and stablecoins like USDT and USDC that can be sent within minutes through reputable crypto exchanges such as XBO.com , Coinbase, Binance and Crypto.com . But despite the value proposition, it is evident that crypto is yet to get the traction it deserves. Some of the most recent statistics indicate there are around 560 million crypto owners globally, this figure is a drop in the ocean compared to the number of people who use banks or other forms of electronic money transfers. So, what exactly does it mean to serve today’s customers? Before answering this question, let’s first highlight some of the reasons why crypto might be the big thing in money and finance. The Future of Money and Finance When Satoshi launched Bitcoin in 2009, the main goal was to introduce a peer-to-peer electronic cash system based on these fundamental principles; decentralization, trustlessness and resistance to censorship. Fast forward to 2025, Bitcoin is not the only crypto in the market, there are more types of digital assets that serving key purposes in the global money exchange and finance system; Access to Global Markets and Cross-Border Transfers One of the reasons crypto has stood out as a state of the art tech is the seamless facilitation of capital transfer without boundaries. Thanks to this technology, a freelancer in Africa can get paid in dollars through stablecoins; this makes it possible to not only receive fast and cheap cross-border payments but also access global markets, starting with the green buck to more sophisticated assets such as tokenized market instruments and commodities. Unlocking Liquidity for Real-World Assets (RWAs) The RWA sector is another crypto niche that is making waves across several markets. Imagine being able to purchase a fraction of a piece of property located in Manhattan or getting access to U.S. treasuries and bonds. That’s the main purpose of RWA’s – unlocking liquidity for such assets by making them more accessible through tokenization. According to a report by Standard Chartered, this sector has grown by 380% over the past 3 years, with projections showing it could eclipse $30 trillion by 2034. Transparency and Censorship-resistance The transparent and censorship -resistant nature of cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH is a feature that certainly belongs in the future. Instead of pushing for centralized financial institutions to be more transparent on important details such as fees, portfolio allocations and interest rate payments, why not have it all on the blockchain where anyone can audit the operations? What’s more is that crypto transactions on a blockchain like Bitcoin and Ethereum are censorship-resistant; this means no intermediary has the capacity to prevent a crypto owner from sending their funds. What it Means to Serve Today’s Customer For a long time, crypto innovators have been building amazing tech, but with one major caveat – it’s not seamless for the average person to navigate or onboard. Save for a few exchanges like Binance, Coinbase and XBO.com which have hacked the needs of today’s crypto consumer, the rest are still juggling between product-market-fit (PMF) and simplifying their UI/UX experience. But what exactly is the average crypto user looking for? At the core is a simple onboarding process and user experience. I don’t have to understand whether my funds are on Ethereum, Solana, Optimism or Arbitrum, all that most crypto users care for is if they can send and receive funds seamlessly. Luckily, for the exchanges that understand the importance of simplicity, we’ve seen considerate features such as XBO’s mobile app solution which is designed for crypto use on the go. Some of the features that support this type of functionality include a smartphone-optimized trading environment and customizable analytics with intuitive controls. XBO is also leaning into user-focused innovation through its ongoing rollout of its native token by offering benefits like trading discounts, cashback, and staking rewards—making participation in the platform beneficial for everyday users and encouraging full adoption throughout its ecosystem. Serving today’s customers also means providing them with more flexible ways of spending their crypto; Binance and Coinbase, for instance, both feature crypto debit cards as part of their offerings. This allows users to easily spend their digital assets without having to convert back to fiat. As much as may be controversial, it is imperative to acknowledge the fact that traditional payment rails also play a major role in enhancing the experience of crypto users. This calls for crypto innovators to partner or build more solutions that are not only compliant but also cheap and fast. In fact, this is one of the features touted by ‘advanced’ crypto service providers in the market today. Want to purchase crypto through a bank? Fine, a fintech? That also cuts it. Conclusion As mentioned in the introduction, crypto has earned its position in the fourth industrial revolution. But as things stand, the levels of adoption are still wanting; it is now time for stakeholders to focus on making it easier for the average person to acquire, use and sell crypto assets. After all, the technical infrastructure is already set and can support more user-friendly UI/UX without serious upgrades or modifications. However, the fundamentals of crypto (transparency, decentralization and immutability) ought not to be overlooked in the quest of making it ‘simple’.

As the lines between genuine creativity and mere replication blur, major platforms are stepping up their game. For those deeply embedded in the cryptocurrency and Web3 space, understanding these shifts is paramount, especially as many projects rely heavily on social media for community building and outreach. Recently, Meta, the tech giant behind Facebook and Instagram, made a pivotal announcement that could reshape how Meta content policy impacts your digital presence and outreach strategies. This move signals a strong push towards valuing authentic creation over simple reposting, directly influencing how content is distributed and monetized across its vast network. Understanding Meta’s Stance on Unoriginal Content In a bold move that echoes similar actions by other major platforms, Meta recently unveiled a comprehensive crackdown on what it terms ‘ unoriginal content ’ on Facebook. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a significant policy update designed to re-emphasize the importance of authentic creation and to protect the intellectual property of genuine creators. For too long, the digital space has grappled with the pervasive issue of content theft and unauthorized reuse, leading to a diluted experience for users and diminished returns for those investing time and effort into original work. So, what exactly does Meta categorize as ‘unoriginal content’? At its core, it refers to accounts that consistently reuse someone else’s text, photos, or videos without adding substantial value or transformation. This isn’t about discouraging engagement or community interaction; rather, it targets deliberate, repetitive re-uploading for personal gain without proper attribution or creative input. Meta has been clear that this policy is distinct from activities like: Reaction Videos: Where creators add their unique commentary, analysis, or emotional response to existing content. Joining Trends: Participating in viral challenges or memes, which inherently involve building upon a shared cultural moment. Adding Personal Takes: Offering a new perspective, critique, or creative twist on someone else’s work, transforming it into something new. The focus, instead, is squarely on accounts that simply repost others’ content, often impersonating original creators or operating as spam accounts. This distinction is crucial for content creators who legitimately engage with existing material in transformative ways, ensuring they won’t be unfairly penalized. The goal is to foster an environment where originality is rewarded, and creative effort is recognized, rather than overshadowed by low-effort duplication. Why the Crackdown Now? The Evolution of Digital Content Meta’s announcement didn’t come out of nowhere. It follows closely on the heels of YouTube, which also clarified its policies around repetitive and mass-produced videos. This synchronized action by two of the world’s largest content platforms highlights a growing industry-wide concern: the proliferation of low-quality, repurposed content, often exacerbated by advancements in AI technology. For years, platforms have struggled with content farms and spammers. However, the rise of sophisticated AI tools has made it easier than ever to generate vast quantities of seemingly new, yet fundamentally unoriginal, material. The digital ecosystem has matured to a point where user expectations for quality and authenticity are higher than ever. Users seek genuine connections and valuable information, not an endless stream of recycled posts. Furthermore, advertisers are increasingly discerning, preferring to associate their brands with high-quality, engaging content rather than spam or deceptive practices. By cracking down on unoriginal content , Meta aims to improve the overall user experience, enhance platform integrity, and ensure that advertising revenue flows to legitimate creators who contribute real value. This strategic shift is also about maintaining competitive advantage. In a crowded social media landscape, platforms that prioritize quality and creator well-being are more likely to attract and retain top talent. By protecting original creators and ensuring they receive due credit and views, Meta reinforces its commitment to being a premier destination for digital expression and community building. It’s a proactive measure to safeguard the platform’s long-term health and relevance in an ever-evolving digital world. The Rising Tide of AI Slop and Its Impact One of the most pressing issues driving Meta’s updated policy, even if not explicitly stated in every line, is the alarming rise of “ AI slop .” This term refers to low-quality, often nonsensical or repetitive media content generated using artificial intelligence tools. While AI offers incredible potential for creativity and efficiency, it has also lowered the barrier to entry for mass-producing content that lacks genuine insight, narrative, or human touch. Consider the ease with which AI tools can now generate text, synthesize voices, and even create video clips. It’s become common to find videos on platforms like YouTube featuring AI-generated voices overlaid on a series of stock photos, generic video clips, or even repurposed footage, all stitched together with minimal human intervention. This kind of content, while technically “new” in its composition, often lacks originality in its core message or presentation. It’s designed to game algorithms, not to engage human audiences meaningfully. Meta’s guidance for creating “original content” subtly hints at its awareness of this problem. The company advises creators against merely “stitching together clips” or simply adding their watermark to content from other sources. Instead, it champions “authentic storytelling” and cautions against short videos offering little value. These descriptions perfectly fit the characteristics of much of the AI-generated “slop” that floods platforms: repetitive visual elements, generic narration, and a lack of depth or unique perspective. By discouraging such practices, Meta aims to subtly curb the spread of low-quality AI-generated content, pushing creators towards more thoughtful and human-centric approaches. Furthermore, Meta’s emphasis on high-quality video captions could also be seen as a gentle nudge away from relying solely on automated AI captioning tools that might produce inaccuracies or lack nuance. While AI can assist in content creation, Meta’s updated Meta content policy underscores the need for human oversight, editing, and genuine creative input to ensure content truly resonates and provides value. Consequences and Enforcement: Impact on Facebook Monetization Meta’s crackdown isn’t just about policy statements; it comes with tangible consequences, particularly for Facebook monetization programs. The company has made it clear that accounts repeatedly abusing the system by reusing someone else’s content will face significant penalties. These measures are designed to hit where it hurts most: the ability to earn revenue and reach an audience. The core consequences include: Loss of Monetization Access: Violating accounts will lose access to Facebook monetization programs for a specified period. This means no ad revenue, no Stars, no subscriptions – a direct hit to the financial viability of content farms and spammers. Reduced Distribution: Posts from penalized accounts will see significantly reduced distribution. This means their content will appear less frequently in users’ feeds, dramatically limiting their reach and impact. The goal is to make it economically unfeasible to operate solely on repurposed content. Original Creator Prioritization: When duplicate videos are detected, Facebook will actively reduce the distribution of the copies, ensuring that the original creator receives the views and credit they deserve. This is a crucial step in rebalancing the scales in favor of genuine content producers. Linking to Original Content: Meta is also testing a system that adds direct links on duplicate videos, pointing viewers back to the original source. This not only gives credit where it’s due but also educates users on where to find authentic content, further devaluing the copied versions. These enforcement actions are not new; Meta has already been active in combating malicious behavior. Earlier this year, the company revealed it had taken down approximately 10 million profiles impersonating large content producers and acted against 500,000 accounts engaged in “spammy behavior or fake engagement.” This history demonstrates Meta’s commitment to maintaining platform integrity, and the new policy is a significant escalation of these ongoing efforts. For legitimate content creators , this means a fairer playing field and greater opportunity to stand out. Navigating the New Landscape: Advice for Content Creators For genuine content creators , Meta’s updated policy should be seen as an opportunity rather than a threat. By prioritizing originality, Meta is creating a more equitable environment where authentic voices can thrive. However, it also means creators need to be mindful of best practices to ensure their content aligns with the new guidelines and avoids unintentional penalties. Here are some actionable insights for creators: Focus on Authenticity: This is the cornerstone. Whether it’s your unique perspective, original footage, or distinctive narrative style, prioritize content that genuinely reflects your creativity and effort. Transformative Use: If you use existing content, ensure your contribution is transformative. Adding significant commentary, unique editing, parody, or a new context elevates it beyond mere reuse. Think “remix” rather than “repost.” Understand the Nuances of AI: While AI tools can be powerful assistants, avoid letting them dictate your entire content strategy. Use AI to enhance, not replace, your originality. Always review and edit AI-generated elements to ensure quality and unique value. High-Quality Captions and Descriptions: Meta explicitly mentioned the importance of high-quality video captions. This implies moving beyond basic automated captions to ensure accuracy, context, and perhaps even a unique voice in your text elements. Monitor Your Professional Dashboard: Meta is rolling out new post-level insights in Facebook’s Professional Dashboard. Creators can use this to understand why their content might not be distributing as expected. This dashboard will also indicate if an account is at risk of content recommendation or monetization penalties, providing early warnings. Stay Informed: Policies evolve. Regularly check Meta’s official creator resources and policy updates to stay ahead of any changes. These changes will roll out gradually over the coming months, giving creators time to adjust their strategies. The new transparency tools in the Professional Dashboard are a welcome addition, empowering creators to understand their performance and compliance status more clearly. This proactive approach by Meta aims to support creators who genuinely contribute to the platform’s vibrancy, while simultaneously weeding out those who exploit it. Meta’s Enforcement Challenges and the Road Ahead While Meta’s intent to crack down on unoriginal content is commendable, the company faces a significant challenge: the accurate and fair enforcement of these policies, particularly through automated means. The article touches upon existing criticism from users, including on Instagram, regarding erroneous and over-enforcement of policies, leading to wrongfully disabled accounts and a perceived lack of human support. A petition with nearly 30,000 signatures highlights this frustration, underscoring the feeling of abandonment among many small businesses and creators who rely on Meta’s platforms. This tension between automated efficiency and human nuance is a perpetual struggle for large-scale content platforms. While AI and algorithms are essential for moderating billions of pieces of content, they can sometimes lack the context or understanding required to differentiate between genuine transformative use and simple reposting. The risk is that legitimate creators might be caught in the crossfire, facing unwarranted penalties and a frustrating lack of recourse due to limited human support. Meta has yet to publicly address these specific criticisms about automated enforcement errors, despite attention from the press and high-profile creators. This silence is a point of concern for many in the creator community. The success of this new Meta content policy will ultimately hinge not just on its stated goals, but on the fairness and accuracy of its implementation. Creators will be watching closely to see if Meta can strike the right balance between robust enforcement and providing adequate support for those who are genuinely trying to create original, valuable content. The broader trend across major platforms, including YouTube’s parallel efforts, indicates a collective industry push towards a more curated, quality-driven digital content ecosystem. As AI technology continues to advance, the challenge of discerning authentic creativity from sophisticated replication will only grow. Meta’s latest move is a critical step in this ongoing battle, aiming to foster an environment where true innovation and valuable contributions are recognized and rewarded, ultimately benefiting both users and ethical content creators alike. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Originality Meta’s decisive action to curb unoriginal content marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of social media. By aligning its policies with those of other industry leaders like YouTube, Meta is signaling a clear commitment to fostering a healthier, more authentic digital environment. This crackdown is not merely about penalizing rule-breakers; it’s fundamentally about protecting and empowering genuine content creators , ensuring that their efforts are recognized, rewarded, and reach the audiences they deserve. For those engaged in the vibrant world of crypto and Web3, where community and original thought are paramount, these changes underscore the importance of building truly unique and valuable content strategies. While challenges in automated enforcement persist, the overall direction points towards a future where originality reigns supreme, paving the way for more meaningful interactions and sustainable Facebook monetization for creators who truly innovate.

The new geofence size more than doubled the service area for the Tesla Robotaxi in only 22 days, and it is larger than Waymo’s by at least 4 square miles. The official Tesla Robotaxi X account left little to the imagination of fans when it posted the updated geofence map with the caption “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger.” Robotaxi also claimed to be big fans of eggplants, adding that they had just expanded their surface area. Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, added fuel to the naughty online conversation by retweeting Teslaconomics’ post with the caption “Bigger, longer, uncut,” followed by a laughing emoji. Musk announced the expansion of Austin’s geofence for the Robotaxi service last week, adding that Tesla was looking to launch the service in the Bay Area in a few weeks. TSLA retail investor Steve Ryan suggested the new geofence map’s phallic shape as a joke, and in true Musk fashion, he made Tesla do it, pissing off critics and making fans laugh. Robotaxi’s new app version rolls out I just opened the Tesla Robotaxi app and the geofenced area in Austin, Texas has officially expanded 🤣 pic.twitter.com/gDOzLvkH4g — Teslaconomics (@Teslaconomics) July 14, 2025 Robotaxi’s new app version was rolled out on July 14, adding walking directions for pickup and drop-off flexibility. According to the Robotaxi team, the addition of notable landmarks made navigating ride-sharing pickups and destinations in large metros and congested areas in Austin easier. The updated app now guides users to Robotaxi pickup and drop-off locations that are not close to specific areas being visited. The Robotaxi app also includes closing times for different drop-off destinations to reduce inconveniences. The new feature warns users when visiting establishments about to close, guiding users to establishments with enough time to serve their needs. It also includes the ability to edit users’ pickup locations and destinations even after booking rides, instead of fixed default spots. Tesla also included the University of Texas in the service area coverage to expand the service to over 53K students. Musk’s un-billionaire-like juvenile humor, like his fixation on the marijuana-related number 420, will likely attract more students to the service’s rides priced at $4.20. The controversial billionaire investor smoked a joint in 2018 during a live podcast on “The Joe Rogan Experience.” He later posted a meme with the caption “Twitter’s next board meeting is gonna be lit.” Robotaxi users get more tips Tesla’s updated Robotaxi app allows users to select their preferred cabin temperature and provides more smart tips while waiting for rides. The tips include how to operate the Model Y door handles and how the driverless vehicles’ light signals work. More smart suggestions include destinations like parks, cafes, shopping centers, restaurants, and other key locations. Additionally, the simple interface provides real-time updates on the arrival of their Robotaxis to help users better understand their shared ride experiences. However, customers can still not leave tips for good service. Tesla is also laying the groundwork for future expansions, and validation vehicles have been seen in Kyle, Texas. According to the company, its engineering and validation teams continuously work on new expansions as the public receives more updated rollouts. However, even after expanding its service area, Tesla has not officially shared details about increasing its fleet. The electric carmakers previously claimed they had shortened the time to new deployments by streamlining the process. Tesla now ships new vehicles from the factory, installs the Robotaxi software, and places ready cars on public streets much faster. Waymo’s long mapping processes are yet to give the Robotaxi’s quick expansions any real competition.

Notably, XRP has broken through key resistance zones in recent sessions, aligning with the broader market rally fueled by Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) new record high above $123,000. The surge saw XRP briefly touch $3 before retracing to $2.86 at press time. That price marks a 3.5% drop over the past 24 hours, though the asset remains up 26% on the week. XRP one-week price chart. Source: Finbold For its price forecast, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s ChatGPT , which offered several scenarios for XRP. ChatGPT predicts XRP price ChatGPT, analyzing technical patterns and market sentiment, predicts that XRP will trade between $2.95 and $3.15 by August 1. Its single-point prediction puts the token at $3.08, an 8% increase from current levels. The AI model noted that XRP has already broken past key resistance near $2.50 and is now consolidating just below the psychologically important $3 mark, a setup that is often bullish in the short term. However, the model cautioned that resistance between $3 and $3.10 remains strong and may be hard to break without a major catalyst. To this end, XRP’s history suggests 5% to 15% moves when consolidating near resistance. Still, the current market environment, described as “greedy but not euphoric”, might support moderate gains rather than explosive rallies. AI price reduction for XRP. Source: ChatGPT Grok predicts XRP price On the other hand, Grok, another AI model, also predicts further upside for XRP, with a target slightly higher at $3.10 by August 1. Its estimate factors in continued bullish momentum, improved regulatory clarity, and strong trading volume. Grok also sees the potential for XRP to test $3.20, though it warned of a possible dip to $2.90 if overbought conditions trigger a pullback. Ultimately, XRP’s ability to hit the expected $3 level will depend on how Bitcoin performs, as the asset has closely mirrored the leading cryptocurrency’s trading patterns. At the same time, if profit-taking accelerates in the coming days, XRP risks losing its $2.50 support, making it harder to reclaim the $3 mark.

The world of finance is rapidly evolving, and crypto exchange Gemini is at the forefront of this transformation. In a groundbreaking move, Gemini has recently unveiled a new suite of Gemini tokenized stocks , specifically designed to empower EU investors with unprecedented access to high-profile U.S. equities. What Are Gemini Tokenized Stocks and Why Do They Matter? Imagine owning a piece of global giants like Nike, McDonald’s, or Starbucks, but with the flexibility and efficiency of blockchain technology. That’s precisely what Gemini tokenized stocks offer. These aren’t just speculative digital tokens; each one is meticulously backed 1:1 by actual, real-world shares of the underlying U.S. company. This innovative approach allows investors to gain exposure to leading American brands like Nike (NKE), McDonald’s (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), Coca-Cola (KO), and Yum! Brands (YUM) without the complexities often associated with cross-border traditional stock trading. The beauty of Gemini tokenized stocks lies in their ability to democratize access, breaking down geographical and financial barriers. Key Features of Tokenized Stocks: 1:1 Backing: Every token issued by Gemini is directly backed by one real share held by a regulated broker-dealer, Dinari. This ensures transparency and asset security. Fractional Ownership: You don’t need to buy an entire share. Tokenization allows you to invest in a fraction of a share, making high-priced stocks more accessible to a wider range of investors. Increased Accessibility: This initiative provides a streamlined pathway for investors in the EU to access U.S. equity markets, which might otherwise be cumbersome due to jurisdictional differences. Potential for Extended Trading Hours: While traditional markets operate during specific hours, tokenized assets on a blockchain could potentially facilitate trading around the clock, offering greater flexibility. Expanding Horizons: Opportunities for EU Investors For EU investors , this launch signifies a substantial leap forward. Historically, gaining direct exposure to the robust U.S. stock market could be cumbersome, involving multiple intermediaries, significant fees, and often, a fragmented regulatory landscape. Gemini’s new offering streamlines this process, providing a seamless gateway to some of the world’s most recognized and valuable companies. This innovation addresses several pain points traditionally faced by EU investors : Feature Traditional Stock Investing (EU to US) Tokenized Stocks via Gemini Access Complexity Often complex, limited brokers, cross-border paperwork Simplified, direct access via Gemini platform Fees & Costs Higher foreign exchange (FX) conversion fees, various transaction charges Potentially lower, more transparent fee structures Fractional Ownership Rare or limited for individual investors Standard feature, enabling smaller investments Trading Hours Limited to U.S. stock market hours (EST) Potentially 24/7 trading (platform dependent), offering greater flexibility Settlement Time Typically T+2 or T+3 (2-3 business days) Near-instant settlement on the blockchain, improving liquidity This direct and efficient access empowers EU investors to diversify their portfolios more effectively, spreading risk and tapping into growth opportunities previously out of reach. The Power of Blockchain: How Tokenized U.S. Stocks Leverage Arbitrum Blockchain The technological backbone supporting these groundbreaking tokenized U.S. stocks is the Arbitrum blockchain . Arbitrum, a prominent Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, is renowned for its ability to process transactions much faster and at a significantly lower cost than the main Ethereum network. This makes it an ideal choice for facilitating the efficient issuance and trading of tokenized assets. Why Arbitrum? Speed: Arbitrum offers rapid transaction finality, meaning your trades are processed and confirmed quickly. Cost-Efficiency: By bundling multiple transactions off-chain, Arbitrum significantly reduces gas fees, making trading more economical. Scalability: It can handle a high volume of transactions, ensuring the platform remains responsive even during peak demand. Security: As a Layer 2 solution, Arbitrum inherits the robust security features of the underlying Ethereum blockchain, providing a secure environment for your investments. Gemini’s collaboration with broker-dealer Dinari is crucial here, ensuring that each token is legally and operationally backed by the real-world shares. This partnership bridges the gap between traditional financial markets and the burgeoning world of decentralized finance, creating a robust and compliant framework for these tokenized U.S. stocks . Navigating the Future of Digital Assets with Gemini The launch of tokenized stocks by Gemini is a testament to the growing convergence of traditional finance and blockchain technology, signaling a maturing landscape for digital assets . As more real-world assets find their digital counterparts, investors are presented with an ever-expanding universe of opportunities. For investors considering these new opportunities in digital assets , it’s essential to keep a few considerations in mind: Understand the Regulatory Landscape: While Gemini operates within a regulated framework, it’s always wise for investors to be aware of their local regulations regarding tokenized assets. Liquidity: While the market for tokenized stocks is growing, it may differ from the liquidity found in traditional, high-volume stock exchanges. Security Practices: Always use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your Gemini account to protect your investments. Education: Take the time to understand how tokenized assets work, their benefits, and any associated risks. Gemini, known for its commitment to regulation and security, aims to provide a trusted environment for exploring these new frontiers in digital assets . This initiative not only expands investment choices but also pushes the boundaries of what’s possible in a globally interconnected financial system. Conclusion Gemini’s introduction of tokenized U.S. stocks for EU investors marks a significant milestone in the evolution of financial markets. By leveraging the power of the Arbitrum blockchain and partnering with Dinari, Gemini is democratizing access to high-value U.S. equities, offering EU investors a streamlined, efficient, and innovative way to diversify their portfolios. This move underscores the immense potential of tokenization to reshape how we invest, making global markets more accessible and liquid than ever before. As the line between traditional and digital assets and traditional finance continues to blur, opportunities for savvy investors are only set to expand.

Market watchers are closely tracking its repeated retests of the $3 level, with a strong bullish order book forming just above and below this psychological barrier. The excitement is clear, both in trading behavior and among analysts. The XRP Demand Surge One such analyst is Dark Defender (@DefendDark), who posted a snapshot of XRP’s active order book and a sharp upward trend on the chart. The image, which shows buy walls building rapidly as sell orders thin out, reflects intense real-time demand. “Salute to the ones who positioned themselves much in advance!” he said, complimenting long-time holders now seeing the impact of their strategy. At the time of his analysis, the asset traded at $3.0178, with visible market interest both above and below that figure. Demand for #XRP is exploding! Salute to the ones who positioned themselves much in advance! Crazy #XRPArmy pic.twitter.com/9T8Eb5pGq0 — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) July 14, 2025 Critical Price Level Retested XRP has repeatedly pushed back to $3, a level that has held it back since it dropped below it in early February . Several prominent traders believe this setup could pave the way for a potential new all-time high, with one analyst recently highlighting $3 as the neckline for a cup-and-handle pattern . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The positive sentiment surrounding XRP is gaining traction, especially as technical indicators suggest a build-up of bullish pressure. The RSI displayed in the image, while climbing, still shows room before entering extreme overbought territory, suggesting further upside remains plausible. Order Book Signals Institutional Interest The liquidity snapshot shared by Dark Defender shows significantly higher green buy orders stacked in the $3.0160–$3.0180 range, while sell pressure appears thin until after $3.0195. More than 74% of current order flow is weighted toward buys and only 26% toward sells, showing the strength of demand. This order imbalance is driving confidence among short-term traders who are now betting on XRP maintaining its momentum. Looking Ahead XRP’s current rally is not happening in isolation. Regulatory clarity and increasing integration of Ripple’s payment solutions globally have helped restore interest in the asset. However, the technical and psychological breakthrough of the $3 mark, which has proven elusive for months, may now mark the beginning of a new phase, and those who got in early will benefit the most.

Bitcoin: Bull Market Pullback Underway The bitcoin (BTC) market rally has stalled in the past 24 hours as expected , but instead of consolidation, prices have pulled back over 5% to $116,800 from record highs in a move typical of a bull market pullback. Reports suggest that profit-taking by long-term holders is weighing on the cryptocurrency's price. It's common for markets to revisit breakout points, in this case, the May 22 high of around $111,960, and test the underlying buying interest before chalking out bigger rallies. A similar dynamic played out earlier this year as prices dropped from over $100,000 of $75,000, revisiting the breakout point from late 2024. From a technical analysis perspective, the broader bullish bias will prevail while prices remain locked in the ascending channel on the daily chart. Over the next 24 hours, the focus will be on the hourly chart, which shows a steep corrective trend lower, with prices trading below the Ichimoku cloud to suggest bearish momentum. However, the RSI on the hourly chart has dropped below 30, indicating an oversold condition – a stark contrast to the above-70 or overbought reading seen a day ago. So, a bounce cannot be ruled out. The probability of a pullback to $111,960 would weaken if the potential recovery ends the downward-trending channel. Such a move will likely result in fresh record highs. Volatility could remain high as cumulative open interest in onshore and offshore futures and offshore perpetual futures has increased to 734.82K BTC, which is just shy of the record 744K BTC in October 2022, according to data source CoinGecko. The growth in open interest is likely being led by offshore exchanges as the number of active contracts on the CME remains below the May high, with the three-month annualized basis still below 10%. Conversely, annualized funding rates on offshore perpetuals have topped 11%, indicating a growing demand for the bullish exposure. AI's take: Bitcoin's 5% pullback is a healthy bull market feature, aiming to retest the key breakout level of $111,960 before potentially initiating a stronger rally. Resistance: $118,000-118,500, $120,000, $123,181 Support: $113,688 (the 38.2% Fib retracement of the rally from June 22 lows), $111,965, $107,823 (the 61.8% Fib) XRP: Holds 100-hour MA and cloud support XRP (XRP) has dropped from $3 and appears to be trapped in a downward-trending channel on the hourly chart, mirroring BTC. Still, XRP appears relatively better off, holding the confluence of the 100-hour simple moving average (SMA) and the Ichimoku cloud at $2.81. A breakout from here would imply an end to the correction and resumption of the broader uptrend toward the yearly peak of $3.4. On the way higher, bulls will likely be tested again at around $3. Watch out for the move below the Ichimoku cloud, as that would strengthen the immediate bear case, shifting focus to the 200-hour SMA at $2.6. Again, volatility could be elevated with perpetual futures open interest hitting a record high of 2.74 billion XRP, according to Coinglass. The annualized XRP funding rates hover at 15%, indicating a growing bias for leveraged bullish plays. AI's take: Despite XRP's hourly chart showing a BTC-mirroring downtrend from $3, its strong hold above the 100-hour SMA and Ichimoku cloud at $2.81 signals underlying support. Record perpetual futures open interest and high funding rates indicate significant leveraged bullish demand, making a breakout above $3, towards $3.4, likely if current support holds. Resistance: $3, $3.4 Support: $2.81, $2.6-$2.65, $2.38 ETH: Awaiting breakout Ether (ETH) remains trapped in an expanding triangle, with the daily stochastic flashing an overbought reading, pointing to stretched upward momentum, which weakens the case for a firm breakout in the short term. A consolidation around the resistance looks likely as prices are firmly above the Ichimoku cloud on the daily chart and short-term SMAs point north, indicating a bullish bias. An eventual breakout would shift focus to $3,400, a level targeted by options traders. AI's take: The daily stochastic being overbought indicates that momentum is stretched, making a convincing push above the upper trendline unlikely in the short term. Resistance: $3,067 (the 61.8% Fib retracement), $3,500, $3,570, $4,000. Support: $2,905, $2,880, $2,739, $2,600 SOL: $168 is the new resistance level SOL's upside remains elusive despite the dual breakout on the daily chart. Since Friday, the bulls have failed at least twice to chew through bearish pressures at around $168, as evidenced by the long upper wicks attached to the candles for Monday and Friday. So, a break above $168 is now needed to confirm bullishness. On the downside, $157 is the level to watch as it marks the neckline support of the double top pattern on the hourly chart. A breakdown of the support line would imply potential for a deeper decline to $146, per the measured move method. AI's take : Traders should watch for a definitive break above $168 to confirm bullish continuation; otherwise, a loss of the $157 neckline support could trigger a deeper decline towards $146. Resistance : $168, $180-$190, $200. Support : $157, $145, $125.",Markets|market analysis|Bitcoin|XRP|open interest|Solana|Ether|News,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BTC|XRP|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-15 09:24:14

The Dogecoin price surged past $0.20, then decreased to the $0.18–$0.19 range. Derivatives volume remains strong, but momentum looks tired Meanwhile, a $0.08 token, Remittix (RTX) , is stealing the spotlight with a forecasted ROI of 5,880% for early backers. DOGE Price Holds But Technical Signals Soften Dogecoin price is currently around $0.19 after failing to remain above $0.20. A bullish break happened over July 9–10, pushing DOGE to $0.186, but it stalled there. Source: TradingView On longer timeframes, key indicators like MACD and RSI remain positive. But resistance at $0.20–$0.21 is proving tough to crack. Dogecoin news updates flag a stalled rally, with bulls losing grip below $0.20. Analysts note that support around $0.18–$0.19 holds critical importance. Can DOGE Still Rally? Traders see a path back up if DOGE can retake $0.20 with volume. If Dogecoin slips below the $0.18 mark, it might dip further to around $0.16 or even $0.17. But it’s not all bearish. Some analysts believe DOGE could hit $0.22 soon. However, the longer-term price prediction is positive. But as Dogecoin price remains range-bound, attention is shifting to tokens with clearer, functional appeal. Remittix Stuns as the New Crypto Delight Remittix (RTX) is hitting headlines with big claims: buy RTX token prospects, 5,880% ROI forecasts, and a working platform for real-world use. Whales are loading up. Here’s why it matters: Global reach: Send crypto directly to bank accounts in 30+ countries Real-world utility: Built for actual use, not just memes Audited by CertiK: Designed with trust and transparency $16M+ raised, with momentum building fast $250,000 Remittix Giveaway: an exclusive opportunity for presale investors Remittix is a crypto with real utility, not just another meme coin. As bulls cool off on DOGE, boost in crypto staking, and DeFi, Remittix offers a steady utility alternative people can actually use. Why Remittix Should Be Your Next Investment Move Dogecoin price is cooling after a strong spike. It still has room to run, but the path to $0.30+ depends on momentum and macro support. Meanwhile, Dogecoin news is making room for tokens like RTX, designed for payments and real adjustments in the remittance landscape.

Ripple CTO believes the adoption of XRP as a wrapped version on other chains is crucial for its long-term growth. XRP price is on the cusp of entering its euphoric phase of the 2025 altseason. Ripple Labs’ chief technology officer (CTO) David Schwartz has welcomed the recent crypto pump- led by Ethereum (ETH) and XRP. Schwartz noted that he is of the view that bull markets are vital to reward investors. However, Schwartz highlighted that most altcoins continue to record lower prices in the short term, which is not a true representation of the underlying utility. According to Schwartz, crypto prices will eventually catch up with their respective real-world utility, especially in the long haul. Nonetheless, he noted that the set of actual real-world problems being solved by crypto assets is considerably small. “I always feel good when prices are high because I hate to think that people are losing money.

Not only have the shorts been dominating the market recently, but the exponential growth has seen the short positions rise to levels never before seen in the history of the digital asset. While this might look bearish at a glance as it means traders expect the price to decline, it could actually end up being ultra-bullish for the altcoin. Ethereum Leverage Positions Reach Record Short Levels In a post on X, market expert Zerohedge revealed an interesting development for Ethereum, and that is the fact that Ethereum shorts have now reached new records. The chart showed the Ether leveraged net totals, and it came out to a -13291, beating the previous high that was set back in May at -12000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Not Stopping At $123,000 — Technical Indicators Point To $140,000 Top This rise in Ethereum shorts proves that there is still a lot of disbelief in the current market rally, and many traders expect the Ethereum price to fall again. However, looking at the historical performance when it comes to shorts reaching record levels, it shows a trend that this could mean the rally could be sustained. For example, back in May 2025, when it set its previous peak of -12000, the Ethereum price had rallied from below $1,800 to above $2,600 before the month was over. This trend is also playing out now as the Ethereum price has crossed $3,000, as the Ether shorts have reached a new peak. How To Stay Positioned For ETH Given that the Ethereum price seems to be headed into what might be a parabolic rally after clearing $3,000, crypto analyst Luca on X has outlined how they intend to position for the surge. Luca explains that with the new week, the Ethereum price is at a key point. This is because it is approaching the 0.618 Fibonacci Retracement level, and this level is important because it has been a point of consolidation for the altcoin in the past. Related Reading: Prepare For ATHs: ‘XRP Train Has Left The Station – Analyst As such, the analyst explains that he intends to keep holding his positions on Ethereum. So far, Luca revealed that he has only de-risked Bitcoin positions as the pioneer cryptocurrency has hit all-time highs, but as the end of the cycle draws closer, the focus remains on altcoins. He maintains that the Ethereum price, alongside altcoins, will end up outperforming Bitcoin once the dominance drops. When this dominance drop happens, the analyst says that is when to begin de-risking altcoin positions. For now, though, the analyst expects Ethereum and altcoins to keep trailing Bitcoin as the dominance still remains high above 64% and BTC is yet to enter its distribution phase.

Recent reports from the Korean Intellectual Property Rights Information Service (KIPRIS) reveal that Hippo Protocol has filed a trademark application for “KRWHP.” This move strongly suggests the protocol is laying the groundwork for a KRW stablecoin – a digital asset pegged to the value of the South Korean Won. What does this mean for the crypto community, and why is this development so important for blockchain innovation Korea ? Hippo Protocol’s Vision: Pioneering a KRW Stablecoin Hippo Protocol’s potential venture into the stablecoin arena marks a pivotal moment for the project and the broader South Korean market. While many stablecoins are pegged to the US Dollar, a KRW stablecoin would offer unique advantages for users within South Korea, minimizing foreign exchange risks and facilitating smoother transactions in local currency. This strategic move aligns with the growing demand for localized digital assets that can seamlessly integrate with national economies. The filing of the “KRWHP” trademark application is more than just a formality; it signals a serious commitment from Hippo Protocol to establish a robust and compliant stablecoin. This proactive approach indicates a deep understanding of the regulatory landscape and the necessity of legal groundwork before launching such a significant financial product. For a market as dynamic and technologically advanced as South Korea’s, a native stablecoin could unlock new avenues for decentralized finance (DeFi), cross-border payments, and everyday digital transactions. Understanding the Power of a South Korean Won Stablecoin What exactly is a stablecoin, and why would a South Korean won stablecoin be so impactful? At its core, a stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically by being pegged to a fiat currency like the US Dollar or, in this case, the South Korean Won. This stability makes them ideal for various purposes, from acting as a safe haven during crypto market volatility to facilitating quick and cost-effective transfers. Here’s why a KRW-pegged stablecoin could be a game-changer: Reduced Volatility: Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, a stablecoin offers price predictability, making it suitable for payments, savings, and lending. Local Market Integration: For South Korean users, a KRW stablecoin eliminates the need to convert to USD-pegged stablecoins, simplifying transactions and reducing conversion fees. Enhanced Liquidity: It could provide a highly liquid on-ramp and off-ramp between the traditional financial system and the crypto ecosystem within South Korea. DeFi Opportunities: A stable and widely adopted KRW stablecoin could fuel the growth of KRW-denominated DeFi protocols, offering new lending, borrowing, and yield farming opportunities. The emergence of a reliable South Korean won stablecoin could bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital economy, fostering greater trust and adoption among mainstream users and institutions. The Korean Crypto Landscape and Future Blockchain Innovation South Korea stands as a global leader in cryptocurrency adoption and technological advancement. With a highly tech-savvy population and a strong appetite for digital innovation, the country has consistently been at the forefront of crypto trends. However, its regulatory environment, while evolving, has also been quite stringent, emphasizing investor protection and market stability. This makes Hippo Protocol’s move particularly noteworthy. The potential introduction of a regulated KRW stablecoin could significantly impact the domestic crypto exchanges and financial institutions. It could provide a compliant and efficient digital medium for transactions, potentially reducing reliance on traditional banking rails for crypto-related activities. This aligns with the broader global trend of central banks exploring digital currencies (CBDCs) and private entities developing stablecoins that adhere to national regulations. The success of such a stablecoin would not only benefit Hippo Protocol but also serve as a blueprint for further blockchain innovation Korea . It could encourage other projects to explore localized digital assets, fostering a more robust and diverse crypto ecosystem that caters specifically to the needs of the Korean market. Navigating Challenges and Unlocking Opportunities in Stablecoin Development While the prospect of a KRWHP stablecoin is exciting, the path to successful stablecoin development is often fraught with challenges. Regulatory clarity remains a primary concern globally, and South Korea is no exception. Ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations, maintaining adequate reserves, and achieving widespread adoption are critical hurdles to overcome. Key Challenges: Regulatory Compliance: Navigating South Korea’s strict financial regulations and obtaining necessary licenses will be paramount. Reserve Management: Maintaining full backing with transparent audits to ensure the stablecoin’s peg remains robust. Adoption and Liquidity: Convincing users and businesses to adopt KRWHP will require strong partnerships and compelling use cases. Competition: While a native KRW stablecoin has an advantage, it will still face competition from other stablecoins and traditional payment methods. Despite these challenges, the opportunities for a well-executed stablecoin development project like KRWHP are immense. It could open doors for: New Payment Solutions: Faster, cheaper cross-border remittances and domestic payments. Digital Asset Trading: Providing a stable base pair for trading other cryptocurrencies on Korean exchanges. Financial Inclusion: Potentially offering financial services to underbanked populations within the digital realm. Global Expansion: If successful domestically, it could serve as a model for other national currency-pegged stablecoins globally. What’s Next for Hippo Protocol and the Market? The trademark application is merely the first visible step in what will likely be a comprehensive process for Hippo Protocol . The next phases will undoubtedly involve engaging with regulators, developing the underlying technical infrastructure, and building partnerships within the Korean financial and crypto sectors. The successful launch of KRWHP could set a new precedent for how national currencies interact with blockchain technology. For investors and enthusiasts, closely monitoring Hippo Protocol’s progress will be crucial. The success of KRWHP could significantly boost the utility and value proposition of the broader Hippo Protocol ecosystem. It also highlights a growing trend in the crypto space: the move towards localized, fiat-backed stablecoins that cater to specific national markets, fostering deeper integration between traditional finance and decentralized technology. Conclusion: A New Era for Korean Crypto? Hippo Protocol’s trademark application for “KRWHP” is a powerful signal of its ambition to launch a KRW stablecoin . This development has the potential to profoundly impact the South Korean crypto market, offering a stable, regulated, and efficient digital asset pegged to the national currency. As stablecoin development continues to evolve globally, Hippo Protocol’s pioneering move could pave the way for a new era of localized digital finance and further solidify South Korea’s position at the forefront of blockchain innovation Korea . The journey ahead will require careful navigation of regulatory complexities and robust technological implementation, but the potential rewards for users and the broader ecosystem are substantial.

XRP rises 25% as ETF launch and crypto legislation align, fueling trading interest this week. ProShares Ultra XRP ETF Approved for NYSE Arca Listing The US Securities and Exchange Commission has approved the listing of the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF on NYSE Arca. According to a filing dated July 14, the leveraged futures-based fund will trade under the ticker UXRP. Trading is expected to begin by the end of this week. The ETF has also been added to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) eligibility list, a key step before trading. While a product page is already live, the fund was not yet trading at the time of publication. Meanwhile, ProShares Ultra XRP ETF aims to deliver 2x the daily performance of an XRP index. Rather than owning the token directly, the fund intermediates it through derivative products: futures contracts and swap agreements. This enables investors to gain leverage on the price of XRP daily without necessarily possessing the asset. The fund’s leveraged structure is intended for short-term trading and may not be suitable for long-term holders. Its launch marks the first such XRP-linked product approved for public trading in the United States. Two More XRP ETFs Await Clearance The company also disclosed plans to launch two additional XRP-related ETFs. These include the Short XRP ETF (XRPS), which seeks -1x daily performance, and the UltraShort XRP ETF (RIPS), targeting -2x exposure. Both funds aim to deliver inverse returns of XRP’s daily price movement. As of now, neither of the inverse ETFs has appeared on the DTCC eligibility list. Their launch remains pending until they receive operational clearance. According to a recent amendment filed on July 11, the company has set July 18 as the tentative launch date for all three funds. ETF Launch Coincides with Crypto Week Legislation The launch of the ProShares XRP ETFs may align with Crypto Week in Washington, D.C., where lawmakers are reviewing new crypto-related legislation. Consequently, the timing could boost attention around XRP-related financial products, especially as industry watchers monitor developments around the Clarity Act and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. XRP price has gained around 25% over the past week amid increased speculation and institutional activity.

Reports on Feasibility Commissioned by Central State Actors The guideline is focused on fintech innovation-oriented digital service firms and financial institutions, including Shanghai Data Group and Guotai Haitong. They are instructed to study the means of stablecoin issuance on the yuan basis as well as consider starting pilot programs. The move follows a meeting last week by the Shanghai State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), where Director He Qing stressed the need for state firms to embrace digital transformation and innovation of financial infrastructure. China’s latest actions may signal a softening of its hard-line history stance toward digital tokens. Government officials are now urging state-owned firms to research how blockchain can assist in creating sectors like cross-border payments, supply chain lending, and asset tokenization. He Qing stated, “State-owned assets and state-owned companies will play a bigger role in scientific and technological innovation, adjustment of industrial mix, and security support.” Global Stablecoin Pressure This step follows as there is mounting pressure from global events in stablecoin adoption and regulation. On July 10, Chinese regulators convened to rethink their positions following the rapid growth of stablecoin use across the world. The Senate has already approved the drafted GENIUS Act in the United States and awaits a vote in the House. Hong Kong is to enact the Stablecoin Ordinance on August 1, which will bring in a licensing regime for HKD-backed stablecoins. The EU had prior to that applied its MiCA structure to govern issuers of stablecoins within the bloc. China’s Next Digital Currency Move?

If so, understanding the ebb and flow between Bitcoin and altcoins is absolutely crucial for making informed decisions. The cryptocurrency landscape is a dynamic arena, often characterized by distinct periods where one asset class outshines the other. Currently, a key metric, the Altcoin Season Index , is signaling a clear trend: we are firmly in a Bitcoin Season . But what exactly does this mean for your portfolio and future investments? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: Your Market Compass The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool, tracked by prominent cryptocurrency price data platforms like CoinMarketCap (CMC). It offers a snapshot of market sentiment and asset performance by comparing how the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have fared against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. This index isn’t just a random number; it’s a barometer for understanding which segment of the market is currently leading the charge. Let’s break down how the index works: Index Range: The score ranges from 1 to 100. Altcoin Season Criteria: For the market to be considered in ‘Altcoin Season,’ at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the specified 90-day period. This is when altcoins typically see significant gains and often capture more investor attention. Bitcoin Season Criteria: Conversely, ‘Bitcoin Season’ occurs when 25% or fewer of these top altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. This indicates that capital is largely flowing into Bitcoin, or Bitcoin is holding its value better during market downturns. Current Snapshot: Why the Index Stands at 31 and Signals Bitcoin Season As of 00:30 UTC on July 15, the Altcoin Season Index registered a score of 31. This figure, unchanged from the previous day, clearly indicates that the market is presently in a pronounced Bitcoin Season . A score of 31 is significantly below the 75 threshold required for altcoin dominance, suggesting that a vast majority of altcoins have not managed to outperform Bitcoin over the last three months. What drives such a shift? Several factors can contribute to Bitcoin’s outperformance: Flight to Safety: During periods of uncertainty or volatility in the broader financial markets, investors often view Bitcoin as a relatively safer asset compared to the more volatile altcoins. Institutional Interest: Growing institutional adoption and large-scale investments often flow into Bitcoin first, given its liquidity and established position. Halving Cycles: Anticipation or post-halving effects can draw significant attention and capital into Bitcoin, as its supply issuance decreases. Dominance Cycle: Bitcoin typically leads bull runs, with altcoins catching up later. A strong Bitcoin Season can be a precursor to a future altcoin rally, but it signifies a current period of Bitcoin strength. Understanding this current market phase is vital for strategizing your next moves in the crypto market . Navigating the Crypto Market: Implications for Your Altcoin Performance So, what does a score of 31 on the Altcoin Season Index mean for your altcoin performance and overall investment strategy? It suggests that, for now, capital is consolidating around Bitcoin. This doesn’t mean altcoins are worthless, but rather that they might be experiencing less significant gains, or even corrections, while Bitcoin either holds strong or makes notable advances. During Bitcoin Season, investors often observe: Lower Altcoin Volatility (Potentially): While altcoins are inherently volatile, their price movements might be more subdued compared to Bitcoin’s gains, or they might experience steeper percentage drops during corrections. Bitcoin Dominance Increase: The percentage of the total crypto market capitalization held by Bitcoin tends to rise. Focus on Foundational Projects: Investors might shift focus to established, larger-cap altcoins with strong fundamentals, rather than highly speculative smaller projects. This period can be challenging for those heavily invested in smaller altcoins hoping for quick returns. It emphasizes the importance of a well-diversified portfolio and a long-term perspective. Forecasting Cryptocurrency Trends: What Comes Next? While the current data points to a clear Bitcoin Season , the cryptocurrency market is cyclical. History suggests that a prolonged period of Bitcoin dominance often sets the stage for a subsequent Altcoin Season . But how do we anticipate these shifts in cryptocurrency trends ? Key indicators and factors to watch for a potential shift: Bitcoin Consolidation: After a strong rally, Bitcoin might enter a period of consolidation, trading sideways. This often allows capital to flow into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. New Narratives and Innovations: The emergence of groundbreaking technologies or strong narratives within the altcoin space (e.g., new DeFi protocols, successful Layer-2 solutions, major gaming projects) can ignite investor interest. Reduced Bitcoin Dominance: A sustained decline in Bitcoin’s market dominance, even if Bitcoin’s price is stable, can signal capital moving into altcoins. Macroeconomic Stability: A more stable global economic environment can encourage investors to take on more risk, flowing into higher-beta assets like altcoins. It’s crucial to remember that the Altcoin Season Index is a lagging indicator. It tells us what has happened, not what will happen. Therefore, while it confirms the current state, active monitoring of market sentiment and fundamental developments is key for anticipating future shifts. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor Navigating the current Bitcoin Season requires a thoughtful approach. Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: Assess your current asset allocation. If you’re heavily weighted in altcoins, consider whether a rebalance towards Bitcoin or stablecoins is prudent for risk management. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): During a Bitcoin Season, altcoin prices might be suppressed. This can be an opportune time to DCA into promising altcoins you’ve researched thoroughly, accumulating them at potentially lower prices. Focus on Fundamentals: Instead of chasing hype, delve into the fundamentals of altcoin projects. Look for strong teams, clear use cases, active development, and robust communities. These projects are more likely to weather a Bitcoin Season and thrive when altcoins regain momentum. Stay Informed: Continuously monitor market news, technical analysis, and the Altcoin Season Index itself. Knowledge is your most powerful tool in the volatile crypto space. Manage Expectations: Understand that not every altcoin will perform equally, especially during a Bitcoin-dominant phase. Patience and realistic expectations are vital. Remember, the cryptocurrency market is cyclical. While the Altcoin Season Index currently points to Bitcoin’s strength, the wheel will eventually turn. Being prepared for both seasons is the mark of a truly strategic investor. The Cycle Continues: A Compelling Summary The Altcoin Season Index , currently at 31, unequivocally signals that the crypto market is in a Bitcoin Season . This means Bitcoin has largely outperformed the majority of the top 100 altcoins over the past 90 days. While this phase might present challenges for immediate altcoin performance , it also offers unique opportunities for strategic accumulation and portfolio rebalancing. Understanding these distinct cryptocurrency trends , from Bitcoin dominance to the eventual resurgence of altcoins, is fundamental for long-term success in this dynamic asset class. Stay vigilant, conduct thorough research, and prepare for the market’s inevitable shifts.

The country’s Investment, Trade and Industry Minister, Zafrul Aziz, also said the ministry expects trade to grow by 4% to 5% this year, despite global economic uncertainties and the threat of tariffs weighing on outlooks. Zafrul noted that Malaysia’s exporters were adapting quickly, noting that front-loading had already taken place and was expected to continue ahead of the August 1 deadline, when another round of higher US import duties was set to take effect. The government’s tough stance amid potential economic headwinds tells a powerful tale: Malaysia will continue to be a competitive and trusted trading nation in the region, even when forced against the wall. Malaysia’s exports fall ahead of US tariff deadline Although the outlook appears rosy, new trade figures revealed some chinks in Malaysia’s export growth. Exports declined in May 2025 for the first time since September 2024 , indicating a potential rocky road ahead. The contraction has added to worries about Malaysia’s exposure to changes worldwide, such as a less open trade policy by the US, one of its biggest trading partners. At the start of May, the White House had already announced plans to slap a 24% levy on a long list of goods, including semiconductors, electronics, parts, crude palm oil, and other goods. But the rate was also increased, more quietly, to 25%, adding pressure on Malaysia to respond somehow. Should the levies go ahead, as an export-oriented country, Malaysia’s overall market share within the region could potentially be at peril. Zafrul said his ministry will “closely monitor the spill-over effect” and prepare exporters to “put in place short-term and long-term measures” if US taxes persist. Some exporters have already rushed to ship their goods before the August 1 deadline, aiming to beat the incoming tariffs . While this surge may temporarily boost current trade figures, analysts warn it could lead to a decline in the coming months as shipment volumes normalize or drop. US tariff talks put Malaysia’s economic sovereignty to the test As the deadline nears, Malaysia is making a diplomatic push to cushion or dodge the harshest tariffs. The United States seeks to eliminate caps on majority ownership in various Malaysian industries. Washington pushed for a far-reaching liberalization of key sectors, according to Zafrul. He said the government consulted other parties to consider whether the country could liberalize these sectors. For foreign ownership, Malaysia caps all strategic areas and categories like logistics, telecommunications, retail, and oil & gas. However, the US wants Malaysia to tear down these barriers in return for tariff relief or trade deals. This move could be politically catastrophic and economically disruptive if not handled carefully. The government is not against liberalization, but it would need to be strategic and inclusive for the country’s good in the long run, Zafrul said. He said discussions were not being had for the sake of having discussions, but to make sure any changes fit the context of our industrial aspirations, and that there is harmony in society.

At this point, it was reported a few weeks ago that Aqua1, a United Arab Emirates-based company, invested $100 million in WLFI. However, the truth behind the $100 million WLFI investment has emerged. It has been revealed that Aqua 1, which previously announced it would strategically purchase $100 million worth of WLFI tokens, is actually a shell company. Accordingly, it was revealed that the main company investing in WLFI was Web3Port, the controversial market maker known for the Movement (MOVE) token scandal. What Happened? As you may recall, it was revealed that Web3Port manipulated the token sale and caused serious losses to investors, which resulted in a huge reaction in the market. The incident was first revealed by Binance, which determined that a large portion of the MOVE token was sold by a market maker named Rentech, who claimed to be affiliated with Web3Port. Binance later revealed that the market maker manipulated the price of MOVE. Related News: Attention Investors! Binance Banned This Altcoin's Market Maker! $38 Million Support Came From The Altcoin Team! Following these incidents, Binance decided to remove the market maker of the altcoin MOVE from its exchange due to its illegal activities. Binance also announced that it had seized the $38 million in USDT proceeds from this MOVE sale. Movement Labs then partnered with Binance to develop a buyback strategy using these funds and attempt to re-inflate the price. Coinbase also delisted the MOVE altcoin. Immediately following Coinbase's delisting, Movement Labs announced the suspension of its co-founder, Rushi Manche, due to a market manipulation scandal. Market maker Web3Port has been banned by many decentralized exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase, on suspicion of market manipulation. *This is not investment advice.

Ethereum ETFs just recorded their biggest inflows since launch, reflecting deepening institutional activity. Liquidations for ETH are well above $100 million daily, given today’s price correction, but the asset is well ahead weekly. GENIUS Act Vote Could Shift Ethereum Demand Ethereum (ETH) was trading near $2,975 as of press time, holding steady after a 17% gain over the last week. Traders are closely watching the US House, which is preparing to vote on the GENIUS Act. This bill could change how stablecoins are regulated and bring major capital to Ethereum. The bill, which already passed the Senate on June 18, would require stablecoin issuers to hold 1:1 reserves and register under federal guidelines. Anti-money laundering compliance would be mandatory. Meanwhile, the House is likely to approve the bill this week, with the platform showing a 95% chance of passage, per Polymarket forecasts. Citing the expected influx of institutional-grade capital if the law is adopted, analyst Ted noted : “ETH pumps if the GENIUS Act passes this week.” Alongside the GENIUS Act, two other crypto-focused bills are scheduled for debate this week. The CLARITY Act would define digital assets as either securities or commodities, potentially ending the long-standing SEC–CFTC dispute. The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, meanwhile, would prevent the rollout of a central bank digital currency in the United States, citing privacy concerns. ETF Activity and Corporate Accumulation Rising Ethereum’s recent momentum has been supported by growing institutional interest. Glassnode data shows that US-listed Ethereum ETFs brought in 225,857 ETH in net inflows last week, the strongest since their launch. This follows a steady accumulation trend by major treasury holders. $ETH broke above $3K for the first time since February. Meanwhile, US spot #Ethereum ETFs recorded their largest weekly net inflows since launch – 225,857 #ETH – extending a multi-week trend of growing institutional demand. pic.twitter.com/zRuhsE4f0u — glassnode (@glassnode) July 14, 2025 In the past month alone, Ethereum treasury companies have acquired more than 545,000 ETH, with an estimated value exceeding $1.6 billion. On-chain indicators show consistent buying during market rallies. Notably, the current technical setup shows a confirmed breakout pattern, often described as a “bull flag,” with ETH holding above the key $3,000 level. Liquidations Point to Shifting Sentiment Over 130,000 traders were liquidated in the past 24 hours, with total losses nearing $500 million, according to Coinglass data. Ethereum was the second-largest contributor to this number, with $106 million in wrecked long positions. If ETH can reclaim the $3,000 resistance with sustained buying, traders are monitoring $3,300 as the next one. A confirmed break could open a path toward $4,000.

The new system features tokenized versions of real-world assets ( RWAs ), fully backed and settled on-chain, while offering transparent audit trails and promising to blend blockchain and traditional finance (TradFi). A significant milestone for blockchain finance, the rollout led to a 13% surge in Robinhood’s share price. Tokenized equities As blockchain adoption expands, more businesses are turning to tokenized shares as a new way to raise capital. Namely, instead of issuing traditional stock certificates, companies can now offer equity in the form of digital assets, such as crypto , to expedite their operations and potentially expand their global reach. Robinhood’s tokenized trading platform runs on the Ethereum ( ETH ) compatible Robinhood Chain, developed using Arbitrum’s ( ARB ) Orbit framework, and now offers tokenized exposure to private firms like SpaceX and OpenAI . These promotional tokens don’t confer direct ownership but are structured as derivatives , mimicking the value of shares based on secondary market pricing. As Andrei Grachev, Managing Partner of DWF Labs, puts it: “The technology is live. Robinhood’s EU tokenized equity launch includes 200+ U.S. stocks and ETFs, trading 24/5 with zero commissions, triggering a 13 % stock price gain. Globally, we also see Kraken and Coinbase rolling out similar programs. These tokens are fully backed, settle on‑chain with audit trails, and resolve real‑world inefficiencies but frameworks must evolve to recognize infrastructure upgrades over regulatory evasion.” — Andrei Grachev, Managing Partner of DWF Labs Robinhood regulatory scrutiny Robinhood’s rapid expansion into tokenized assets quickly drew regulatory attention. For instance, the Bank of Lithuania, which regulates the platform’s EU operations, requested additional details about the private company tokens. In response, Robinhood remained adamant that the offerings comply with the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) and Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) frameworks, which treat such tokens as derivative instruments rather than direct equity holdings. In the meantime, OpenAI publicly distanced itself from the offering, cautioning users against trading the tokens as they do not represent OpenAI equity. Robinhood Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Vlad Tewnev responded to the controversy by clarifying that the product is “enabled by Robinhood’s ownership stake in a special purpose vehicle,” not by direct equity ownership. Tenev further explained that OpenAI’s hybrid organizational model (originally a non-profit, now encompassing a capped-profit subsidiary) permits institutional investors to gain exposure through complex financial instruments. These may include conversion rights or other derivatives, Tenev argued, which Robinhood mirrors in its tokenized product for retail access.

Arcadia Finance, which operates on the Base blockchain, was targeted on July 15 in a swift and sophisticated attack that drained user funds from multiple vaults. According to blockchain security firm Cyvers, the attacker exploited a flaw in Arcadia’s Rebalancer contract by passing in arbitrary swap parameters. This allowed them to trigger unauthorised token swaps that bypassed normal checks, ultimately allowing them to drain funds from user vaults without proper validation. At around 04:05:58 UTC today, the attackers deployed a malicious contract and triggered a sequence of unauthorized transactions. Within a minute, the attacker began siphoning funds from the platform and subsequently converting the stolen tokens to Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) on the Base network before bridging them to Ethereum mainnet addresses. Cyvers traced the funds and found that the attacker received 199 WETH and over 965 million AERO tokens during the swap process. The stolen cryptocurrencies included approximately 2.3 million USDC and 227,000 USDS, distributed across 12 affected addresses. To obscure their trail, the attacker distributed the funds across intermediary wallets, with Cyvers estimating that the attacker may be preparing to launder the funds via cryptocurrency mixers. As an immediate post-incident measure, Arcadia Finance has issued a public alert urging users to revoke permissions granted to the platform’s Rebalancer. The team has acknowledged the exploit on social media, confirming “unauthorised transactions via a Rebalancer” and assured users that more information would follow. Researchers at Cyvers have recommended contacting exchanges and bridge operators to blacklist the attacker’s addresses on Base and Ethereum and file reports with law enforcement to prevent further attacks. This is not the first time Arcadia Finance has become the victim of an exploit that led to losses. In July 2023, the protocol lost around $455,000 due to another vulnerability in code across some of its contracts. At the time, most of the stolen funds were funneled through Tornado Cash. DeFi exploits continue to plague crypto users The Arcadia Finance exploit is the latest in a string of defi-related exploits that have transpired in recent months. Last month alone, multiple protocols were exploited by bad actors. For instance, in late June, a hacker was able to launch a price manipulation attack on DeFi protocol Resupply to siphon roughly $9.6 million in crypto. Just days before, Blockchain security auditor Hacken lost roughly $250,000 worth of its native HAI token due to a compromised private key. Over $2.47 billion has been lost to hacks, scams, and exploits across the crypto sector, according to blockchain security firm CertiK. As previously covered in Invezz, Q2 2025 alone saw more than $800 million in losses from 144 incidents, although the figure represented a 52% drop in total value lost compared to the first quarter.

Imagine a digital currency as stable as the Korean won, seamlessly integrated into your daily transactions. This isn’t just a distant dream; Korea Investment and Securities, a prominent financial powerhouse, is actively exploring the creation of a won-based stablecoin , signaling a groundbreaking shift in the nation’s financial future. Won-based Stablecoin: A Game Changer for Korea? A won-based stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, pegged directly to the Korean won. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, its value would theoretically remain constant, making it ideal for everyday transactions, remittances, and even as a foundation for more complex financial products. This stability is its core strength, offering the benefits of blockchain technology without the price volatility typically associated with digital assets. Stability: Directly tied to the Korean won, minimizing price fluctuations and offering a reliable medium of exchange. Efficiency: Potentially enabling faster and cheaper transactions compared to traditional banking systems, especially for cross-border payments. Accessibility: Could enhance financial inclusion by providing easier access to digital financial services for a broader population. Innovation: Opens doors for new financial services, decentralized applications (dApps), and integration into emerging Web3 ecosystems. This strategic move by Korea Investment and Securities isn’t just about creating a new digital asset; it’s about reimagining how money moves and is used within the economy, setting the stage for significant advancements in digital finance. South Korean Stablecoin Ambitions: What’s Driving Them? South Korea has long been at the forefront of technological adoption, and its interest in a South Korean stablecoin reflects a broader global trend towards digital currencies. The nation’s advanced tech infrastructure and high internet penetration make it fertile ground for such innovations. The drive stems from several factors, positioning South Korea to potentially lead in this evolving space: Key Driver Description Global Digital Shift Nations worldwide are actively exploring Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and regulated private stablecoins, pushing for digital transformation in finance. Enhanced Financial Inclusion The potential to provide accessible and efficient financial services to a wider demographic, including those underserved by traditional banking. Competitive Edge Positioning South Korea as a leader in digital finance and blockchain innovation, attracting investment and talent. Streamlined Transactions The ability to streamline cross-border payments and reduce transaction costs, particularly beneficial for a trade-reliant economy like South Korea’s. The development of a robust South Korean stablecoin ecosystem could significantly bolster the nation’s economic infrastructure and digital competitiveness. Navigating Stablecoin Regulation: The Path Ahead One of the most critical aspects of any stablecoin initiative is robust stablecoin regulation . Governments globally are grappling with how to oversee these digital assets to protect consumers, prevent illicit activities, and maintain financial stability. Korea Investment and Securities’ proactive approach, including establishing an internal task force, highlights their commitment to aligning with upcoming regulatory frameworks. The task force is specifically studying international cases, learning from the successes and challenges faced by other jurisdictions in implementing and regulating stablecoins. This foresight is crucial, as clear and comprehensive stablecoin regulation will be the bedrock upon which trust and widespread adoption are built. Without a well-defined regulatory landscape, the full potential of these digital assets cannot be realized, making compliance a top priority for institutions entering this space. Korea Investment Securities: At the Forefront of Innovation The involvement of a major financial player like Korea Investment Securities underscores the growing institutional interest in digital assets. Their decision to consider a trademark filing and form a dedicated task force isn’t merely a speculative venture; it’s a strategic move to prepare for a future where digital currencies play a more central role in the global economy. This commitment positions them as a key innovator in the evolving financial landscape. The task force’s mandate extends beyond just technical development; it involves a multifaceted approach: Studying global best practices in stablecoin design, implementation, and risk management.

Despite rallying over 27% in the past week and briefly reclaiming the $3 mark on July 14, the token has pulled back to around $2.86, sparking fresh speculation about market manipulation and whale behavior.

Are you seeing this? pic.twitter.com/fWKQUESNqQ — Ali (@ali_charts) July 14, 2025 Is XRP Being Suppressed? The Theory Resurfaces Versan Aljarrah , co-founder of Black Swan Capitalist , believes the XRP price is being deliberately suppressed by large institutions, he claimed: “XRP can’t even stay above $3 because it threatens everything.” According to Aljarrah, XRP’s unique real-world utility —especially its ability to enable instant cross-border payments —poses a serious threat to traditional financial systems. He implies that maintaining the status quo benefits entities invested in slow, high-fee global payments, and therefore suppressing XRP becomes strategic. This suppression theory is not new. Many XRP holders have long pointed to: Ripple’s monthly escrow unlocks Algorithmic trading patterns Ongoing regulatory scrutiny as tactics that limit the token’s price discovery. On-Chain Data Shows Whale Confidence Growing Despite the pullback, on-chain metrics point to increasing confidence among large holders. Whale wallets (holding over 1 million XRP) have surged to 2,743+ These wallets collectively control over 47 billion XRP Data shows steady accumulation during dips, hinting at strong long-term belief in XRP’s fundamentals. This increase in whale activity suggests that major investors are positioning themselves for a potential long-term breakout . Volatility Spikes: What’s Next for XRP? XRP’s implied volatility has surged to 96% , suggesting a potential 13% price swing in either direction this week. While price action remains choppy, the setup looks promising if XRP can break through resistance with volume. Key Scenarios to Watch: Scenario Impact Breakout above $3 with strong volume Bullish continuation toward $4–$6 Failure to reclaim $3 Possible retest of $2.60–$2.80 support zone High volatility continues Short-term chop likely before breakout Final Thoughts: Is XRP Ready for a Major Rally? The XRP community is split. Some see this dip as strategic suppression , while others argue it’s just profit-taking and resistance testing . With Crypto Week underway and macro factors in play, the stage is set for a decisive move. Until XRP clears the $3 level with conviction , expect heightened volatility and mixed sentiment. But if volume confirms a breakout, XRP could aim for $4–$6 in the near term, potentially even higher if whale accumulation continues and market sentiment improves. FAQ Why is XRP Price Down Today? XRP dropped below $3 due to strong profit-taking near resistance and rising market volatility. Is XRP price being suppressed? Some analysts and XRP supporters believe institutional actors suppress the price to limit its disruptive potential in finance. What’s XRP Price Prediction for 2025 Analysts like Peter Brandt and Ali Martinez foresee a rally to $4.47–$4.80 if XRP closes above $3 with volume. Are whales buying XRP?

Excitement over upcoming legislation in the U.S. has spurred bitcoin’s recent rally, the german lender said, but it is notable that the crypto's rise has also been accompanied by a historic decline in volatility levels. The world's largest cryptocurrency has risen nearly 75% since mid-November, driven by a mix of favorable regulations, growing institutional adoption, and global macroeconomic shifts, the report said. The rally coincides with “Crypto Week” in Washington, DC, highlighting increasing government and corporate engagement with digital assets. This week the House of Representatives is set to vote on the CLARITY Act, a crypto market structure bill, and the GENIUS Act, which regulates stablecoins in the U.S. Deutsche Bank suggests the drop in volatility signals a maturing market, where regulatory clarity, broader adoption, and long-term investment behaviors are stabilizing performance. As bitcoin gains legitimacy through regulation and integration into traditional portfolios, it may continue to shed its speculative image and evolve into a more stable, strategic asset, the report added. As volatility decreases and regulatory certainty increases, bitcoin is becoming more appealing for pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and other long-term allocators.

On Tuesday, long-term government yields quietly hit levels not seen before. The 30-year Japanese bond yield jumped to 3.20%, a fresh record. It didn’t come with alarms, but the fallout is loud. Since 2019, those same bonds have now lost 45% of their value. The financial damage is starting to spread, and confidence in the country’s ability to manage its debt is sinking, fast. According to CNBC, this collapse has triggered a chain reaction. Over the past year, yields on the 30Y note climbed by 100 basis points, a surge that’s left institutional portfolios in tatters. Japan’s four largest life insurers reported their unrealized losses on domestic bonds shot up from around $15 billion to $60 billion in Q1 2025. That’s not a small uptick—that’s four times bigger in just one year. Bank of Japan absorbs the damage The worst numbers are coming from the Bank of Japan. The central bank reported $198 billion in unrealized losses on government bonds for Fiscal Year 2024. One year earlier, that figure was around $66 billion. The losses have tripled, and nothing suggests they’re slowing down. In fact, the bleed is accelerating. It’s not just a bad year, it’s a system that’s starting to break. That breakdown is now visible in Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio, which has officially crossed 260%, the highest level in the country’s modern history. That ratio is now double that of the United States, even though the U.S. is also ramping up deficit spending under President Donald Trump. While America might be following behind, Japan is already deep in the hole. There’s another problem: who holds all this collapsing debt? The Bank of Japan itself owns 52% of all domestic government bonds. Life insurers only hold 13.4%, banks hold 9.8%, and pension funds 8.9%. That means over half of the bonds crashing on fears of a default are held by the issuer. It’s the equivalent of lending money to yourself and then watching your own IOUs burn. Global markets feel the pressure Zooming out, this isn’t just about Japan. The U.S. 10-year yield has risen by nearly 500% since 2020, just behind the jump in Japan’s 30Y. That’s because Washington is flooding the market with bonds to finance Trump’s aggressive fiscal push. As supply rises, prices drop. The situation is dragging global bond markets into uncharted territory. Inflation is making it worse. In May, Japan’s core CPI, excluding fresh food, rose 3.7% year-over-year, the fastest pace since January 2023. That’s the exact scenario U.S. Federal Reserve officials are trying to avoid, and it’s why they keep warning that interest rates may stay “higher for longer.” And then there’s the weirdest part: Germany’s 30Y bond yields are almost identical to Japan’s, around 3.1%. But Germany has a Debt-to-GDP ratio of 62% and a policy rate of 2.25%, compared to Japan’s 0.50% and 260%+ debt ratio. The math doesn’t add up. It shows the global market is under pressure and nobody wants to be the first to cut spending. Now, Japan’s mess is a warning to everyone else. A preview of what happens when governments rely too much on debt. Bond market liquidity is already worse than during the 2008 financial crisis. That’s not speculation, it’s a fact. And investors are reacting. This is why Bitcoin and gold are both exploding to all-time highs. People are moving their money out of bonds and into hard assets. The market isn’t waiting around for politicians to fix it. It already knows what’s coming. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

One token in particular is grabbing serious attention— Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . With whale wallets now diverting capital from speculative assets into functional decentralized infrastructure, MUTM is rising as a preferred destination. The appeal isn’t difficult to see. While meme coins have delivered short-term hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating a non-custodial, lending-based ecosystem where investors earn yield and borrowers access liquidity across a two-pronged lending engine. The platform’s utility, revenue-sharing structure, and upcoming stablecoin system provide real value—something Dogecoin (DOGE) never offered. 73% Sold at $0.03, Listing at $0.06: The Final Window Is Narrowing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 5 of its presale. With $12.2 million raised, over 13,200 holders, and 73% of the tokens already sold, only 27% remain available at the current price of $0.03. Once the supply is fully taken, the next presale phase will open at $0.035—a 20% jump ahead of the final $0.06 listing price. Early investors from Phase 1, who secured entry at $0.01, are already sitting on 200% paper gains. With the listing price already scheduled and strong market support forming, current buyers are still in the running for 5x returns at launch and much more in the following growth phase. But this token is not just about presale hype. The infrastructure is backed by a live roadmap with major milestones already being implemented. mtTokens—such as mtETH, mtUSDT, or mtBTC—can be staked into dividend-generating smart contracts. Revenue earned from borrowing activity is programmed to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market and distribute them to mtToken stakers, enhancing yield with a second stream of returns. The stablecoin currently in development is another major step. Designed to always hold a $1 peg, it will be minted only when borrowers create overcollateralized loans and automatically burned on repayment or liquidation. Minting will be capped per issuer, and interest rates will be managed by protocol governance to maintain price stability. Security has also been prioritized. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has completed a third-party smart contract audit with CertiK, earning a 95.00 Token Scan Score and a 77.50 Skynet rating. A $50,000 Bug Bounty is now live to further ensure safety. At launch, the Beta version of the platform will go live, supported by full Layer-2 scaling, offering lower fees and faster transactions for all users. To amplify its community growth, the team has also rolled out a $100,000 giveaway , with ten winners each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM. Where Lending Meets Long-Term Yield Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate on two lending tracks: a peer-to-contract (P2C) model and a peer-to-peer (P2P) alternative. In the P2C model, users will be able to deposit blue-chip assets and stablecoins like BTC, ETH, USDT, or DAI into audited liquidity pools that fund overcollateralized loans. For instance, depositing 2 BTC ($115,000/BTC) into a pool with an 8% APY would generate around $18,400 per year. Depositors will receive mtTokens—such as mtBTC—that grow in value as interest accrues and can also be used for staking rewards or future borrowing. In the P2P model, users will create custom lending agreements directly. For example, a lender may offer 10,000 SHIBA INU tokens, while the borrower locks DAI as collateral. With a negotiated 16% APR, both parties will benefit from tailored terms within a fully decentralized, non-custodial structure. This P2P layer is designed to handle riskier or less liquid assets like meme coins, isolated from the main liquidity pools. Mutuum’s dynamic loan-to-value (LTV) system will enhance both models. Depending on asset type and risk, borrowers will be able to access between 40% and 80% LTV or beyond. Loans will remain open-ended with no fixed repayment date unless liquidation thresholds are breached. All lending activity will be transparently executed on-chain, ensuring users always retain full control over their funds without custodial risk. Whales Don’t Chase Hype—They Hunt Value As Dogecoin (DOGE) flows slow and institutional eyes scan for real yield, the quiet accumulation of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) becomes more obvious. This is no short-lived gamble. This is a presale building toward a long-term decentralized lending ecosystem, offering real returns backed by algorithmic design, on-chain automation, and provable security. The $0.03 window is closing fast. Once the next phase begins at $0.035, those who hesitated will be looking at a higher cost for the same token. As big wallets reposition into infrastructure tokens with utility and yield, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands as their latest top target. Now’s your chance.

However, a fascinating and crucial perspective has emerged from China, challenging the universal necessity of these digital assets. China International Capital Corporation (CICC), a leading investment bank, has unveiled its findings, suggesting that independent blockchain-based China stablecoins are unlikely to find a foothold in the nation’s already sophisticated financial landscape. Why China’s Payment Ecosystem Already Excels For many, the idea of a stablecoin offers a solution to the volatility inherent in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. But what if a country’s existing payment infrastructure already provides the stability, efficiency, and low costs that stablecoins promise? This is precisely the argument put forth by CICC. China’s digital payment realm is dominated by giants like WeChat Pay and Alipay, which have fundamentally transformed how transactions occur for hundreds of millions of people. Consider these points about China’s existing payment ecosystem : “Quasi-Stablecoin” Functionality: CICC highlights that platforms like WeChat Pay already operate as “quasi-stablecoins.” Users hold balances pegged directly to the renminbi (RMB), ensuring price stability. These balances are backed by legal reserves, mirroring the very mechanism stablecoins aim to achieve. Unmatched Efficiency and Low Cost: One of the most compelling aspects is the transaction fees. WeChat Pay and Alipay charge ultra-low fees, often just a fraction of a percent. This stands in stark contrast to the multi-percent fees sometimes seen on overseas platforms, including those for certain stablecoin transactions. Widespread Adoption: Digital payments are ubiquitous in China, from street vendors to high-end retailers. The convenience and speed are unparalleled, making cash almost obsolete in many urban areas. This mature, efficient, and incredibly low-cost environment means the core problems that independent stablecoins seek to solve—volatility, high fees, and slow transactions—simply don’t exist to the same degree within China’s domestic payment system. Dissecting the CICC Report: A Deep Dive The recent CICC report , as noted by JinSe Finance, delves into the specifics of why independent stablecoins would struggle to gain traction. The report essentially argues that the existing infrastructure has already achieved what stablecoins aspire to, but with the added benefits of established regulatory oversight and widespread trust. The bank’s analysis suggests that the value proposition of a new, blockchain-based stablecoin is significantly diminished when compared to the seamless experience already provided by dominant players. For the average Chinese consumer or business, switching to a new, potentially less regulated, and less integrated stablecoin system would offer no discernible advantages and might even introduce unnecessary friction or risk. Furthermore, China maintains strict capital controls and a tightly regulated financial system. The introduction of independent stablecoins, especially those not directly controlled or overseen by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), would likely conflict with these existing frameworks. The nation prioritizes financial stability and control, making it inherently cautious about decentralized financial instruments that could circumvent its established mechanisms. The Digital Yuan: China’s Own Stablecoin Solution? It’s impossible to discuss China stablecoins without addressing the elephant in the room: the Digital Yuan (e-CNY). While not a blockchain-based stablecoin in the decentralized sense, the e-CNY is China’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) and serves as a digital version of its fiat currency. This government-backed digital currency is undergoing extensive trials and is designed to integrate seamlessly into the existing payment ecosystem. The Digital Yuan essentially functions as the ultimate official stablecoin, offering: Sovereign Backing: Directly issued and guaranteed by the PBOC, ensuring ultimate stability and trust. Programmability: Potential for smart contract-like features, allowing for specific use cases and enhanced financial control. Integration: Designed to work alongside WeChat Pay and Alipay, not replace them, but rather offer another layer of digital payment infrastructure. Enhanced Oversight: Provides the central bank with greater visibility and control over monetary flows, crucial for financial stability and combating illicit activities. The existence and ongoing rollout of the Digital Yuan further solidify CICC’s argument. If the state itself is providing a digital, stable version of its currency, the need for private, independent stablecoins diminishes even further. Why would consumers or businesses opt for a less official, potentially riskier alternative when a state-backed digital currency offers superior security and integration? Global Stablecoin Trends vs. China’s Unique Path Globally, stablecoins like USDT and USDC play a significant role in the cryptocurrency market, often serving as liquidity bridges, trading pairs, and a store of value during market volatility. Regulatory discussions around stablecoins are intense in the West, with governments exploring frameworks for their oversight and issuance. However, China’s approach stands in stark contrast. Its robust and centralized payment ecosystem , coupled with its proactive development of the Digital Yuan, positions it uniquely. Unlike many Western nations where stablecoins emerged to fill perceived gaps in traditional finance or to offer a decentralized alternative, China’s financial system already provides highly efficient digital payment solutions. The focus in China is on control, stability, and integration within the existing state-led financial framework, rather than fostering decentralized alternatives. This difference in philosophy and existing infrastructure explains why the CICC report comes to its seemingly counter-intuitive conclusion for those accustomed to Western crypto narratives. For China, the ‘problem’ that stablecoins solve simply isn’t a pressing issue domestically. What Does This Mean for the Future of Digital Finance? CICC’s assessment offers crucial insights into China’s strategic direction regarding digital currencies. It underscores a clear preference for a centrally controlled, efficient, and highly integrated digital financial system, rather than one driven by independent, decentralized blockchain projects. This doesn’t mean China is against all forms of digital innovation; quite the opposite, as seen with the Digital Yuan. However, the innovation must align with national priorities of stability, control, and efficiency. For global crypto enthusiasts and developers, this perspective from CICC serves as a powerful reminder that not all markets operate under the same assumptions or have the same needs. While stablecoins may be transformative in some regions, their utility is context-dependent. In China, the existing financial architecture and regulatory environment have already addressed many of the challenges that stablecoins aim to overcome. In conclusion, CICC’s assessment provides a compelling argument for why independent stablecoins are unlikely to make significant inroads in China. The nation’s mature, efficient, and incredibly low-cost payment ecosystem, spearheaded by giants like WeChat Pay , coupled with the ongoing development of the Digital Yuan , effectively negates the core value proposition of private stablecoins. China’s digital financial future appears to be one of centralized innovation and unparalleled efficiency, built upon its already formidable foundation.

Analyst Warns This Might Be a Short-Lived Alt Window appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is leading the crypto rally once again, surging to a new all-time high of $123,000 earlier this month. So far in July, BTC has gained 9.79%, and in the last seven days alone, it jumped by 8.8%, reigniting investor excitement across the market. But with Bitcoin dominance rising, the big question now is: Will altcoins follow—or is this another fakeout? Bitcoin Breaks $120K, Is It Time for Altseason? $BTC just hit a new ATH at $123,000. But where are the altcoin pumps? I’ve gone back through the last 3 $BTC breakouts to find patterns and the signs are finally lining up. Here's what to expect next for $ETH , $SOL , $XRP , and… — VirtualBacon (@VirtualBacon0x) July 14, 2025 Bitcoin Breaks Out to $123K Bitcoin’s bullish momentum continues, marking a 15.9% gain between June 23 and July 15 . This rally pushed BTC from $107K to $123K , a 14.95% jump , making it the biggest breakout of Q3 so far. In Q2 2025, Bitcoin recorded an impressive 29.9% return , supported by: April: +14.2% May: +11.1% June: +2.40% So far in Q3, Bitcoin is already up 9.69% —and counting.

Popular analyst VirtualBacon shared a detailed thread on X, analyzing BTC’s current breakout and what it means for altcoins. According to him, this may not be a full-blown altseason , but rather a short “altcoin rotation window” . Historically, after each major BTC breakout since mid-2023 , altcoins typically rallied for 3–5 weeks before Bitcoin resumed dominance.

At present, Bitcoin dominance sits at 64.34% , up from 57.59% at the start of the year . This continued rise suggests money is still flowing into Bitcoin first. The only pullback was a 4.83% drop in May, which quickly recovered. VirtualBacon emphasizes that a sustained altcoin season needs BTC dominance to decline , something that hasn’t happened yet. But short-term opportunities may still exist. Altcoins to Watch Now VirtualBacon highlights several altcoins with breakout potential: BNB : Near cycle lows LINK : Undervalued with strong fundamentals ADA : Forming a macro double-bottom TRX : Quiet strength DOGE : Known for rallying post-BTC breakouts He also notes Solana ecosystem tokens are showing strength: Bonk : +110.9% (14 days) PENGU : +112.9% (14 days) Emerging Layer-1s and smart contract platforms are also on the radar: SUI, Aptos (APT), and Avalanche (AVAX) —with AVAX yet to rally since October 2023 . Meanwhile, narrative-driven tokens like TAO (14x in 5 months) and PEPE (6.6x in 3 months) have shown what’s possible during strong Bitcoin uptrends. What Happens If Bitcoin Hits $150K? VirtualBacon predicts that if BTC touches $150K , the top 20 altcoins could explode in value, as institutional and retail investors look for the next big opportunity. While Bitcoin leads the charge, altcoins may have a short-term window to rally . Whether this turns into a full-scale altseason will depend on Bitcoin dominance , overall market sentiment, and how investors rotate capital in the coming weeks.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|ALTCOIN|TRADING|BUSINESS|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-15 10:04:59

Personal wealth management, special life events, and a flight to less volatile assets are all valid reasons to sell. The 500-day Bitcoin halving model, Pi Cycle Top Indicator, Crypto Fear and Greed Index, and RSI all assist in forecasting the market top. Proactively move crypto to exchanges, unstake any assets, understand fees and taxes, set partial profit targets, and monitor for blow-off tops. Introduction If you are a Hodler of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), congratulations! It's been on a great run lately, up 39% over the past 3 months. Bitcoin 3-month chart (Coingecko.com) Most cryptocurrencies have also enjoyed bullish trends recently, and the market appears poised for further gains. So, if the market continues to surge, what’s your plan? Will you hold forever or take profits? When’s the right time to sell? What groundwork should you lay now? This article offers practical insights on spotting a potential market peak and preparing accordingly. Having a plan before the market overheats is critical. To sell or not to sell, that is the question Why would anyone consider selling their Bitcoin? Michael Saylor has famously said , “Never sell your Bitcoin.” To Mr. Saylor, I'd say, ""You do you."" For the rest of us, personal circumstances should guide our decisions. Finance is an area of life where we should seek as much guidance as possible but never abdicate our final authority. I’m not here to push anyone to sell, but there are three compelling reasons to consider liquidating Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies this cycle. The first is wealth management . Five years ago, BTC traded around $10,000 per coin. An investment then is now nearly worth 12X. Those courageous enough to buy during the COVID market dip in March 2020 would now see gains of almost 24X. For some, crypto holdings have grown to dominate their entire portfolio. There is nothing wrong with rebalancing holdings to diversify into metals, quality real estate, and yield-bearing investments. The second reason is various life events, the chief of which is buying a home. Purchasing real estate triggers the immediate need for large amounts of capital, at least for a down payment. Some may prefer to sell enough assets to avoid a mortgage altogether, eliminating the long-term interest costs and providing the wonderful security of outright ownership. Some other important life events could be educational expenses, sudden medical bills, starting a business, or just to cash in your chips for normal or early retirement. The last is what I call crypto fatigue . Some of us have weathered multiple crypto cycles. When I first bought a substantial amount of Bitcoin, the price plummeted 66% in a few months and languished there for two years. Now I'm in my fourth crypto cycle, and I've seen it all. Bitcoin crashes of up to 80%, alt coins soaring and then going to zero, the ICO boom, the NFT craze, the Terra Luna crash, the collapse of FTX, Celsius, Voyager, and Three Arrows Capital, and too many scammers to count. Crypto offers high rewards but comes with extreme risk, volatility, and wild events. The emotional pain of drawdowns, scams, and crashes drives many to seek calmer, safer investments. Market top indicators A rookie crypto mistake is relying on gut feelings to take profits. Formulate an exit strategy well in advance and start by identifying when to sell. There are many models useful to forecast the potential price peak of the Bitcoin cycle. Here are summaries of some popular ones. I recommend using several methods in tandem because, as the old saying goes, there is wisdom in a multitude of counselors. The 500-day Bitcoin halving model This ties the price of Bitcoin to its halving events, which occur roughly every four years. The strategy, in a nutshell, is to buy 500 days before the halving and sell 500 days afterwards. Bitcoin prices 500 days before and after halvings Halving Date 500 Days Before Price 500 Days Before 500 Days After Price 500 Days After Approx. Return July 9, 2016 February 25, 2015 ~$238 November 25, 2017 ~$8,200 ~3,345% May 11, 2020 December 28, 2018 ~$3,800 September 26, 2021 ~$43,000 ~1,032% Note: the 500-day post-halving price target is not exact to the day. In 2017, the BTC cycle high was actually in December; in 2021, it was in October. But this model serves as a great ""two-minute warning"" for the end of the game. The last Bitcoin halving occurred on April 20, 2024, and 500 days after is September 1, 2025. Historical trends would suggest a cycle high slightly after that date, somewhere in September or October 2025. Bonus: Given that the next Bitcoin halving is estimated to occur in March or April 2028, the next cycle low buying opportunity would be October or November 2026. Pi Cycle Top Indicator This technical analysis tool identifies potential market inflection points. It's based on the relationship between two moving BTC averages, the 111-day (111DMA) and the 350-day multiplied by 2 (350DMA x 2). When the 111MDA crosses above the 350DMA x 2, it indicates the start of a bull run. When the 111DMA crosses below the 350DMA × 2, the charts tell the story of a price peak and subsequent correction. The Pi Cycle Indicator complements the 500-day halving model by providing a more precise signal for when to sell within the 500-day post-halving window. Pi Cycle Top Indicator (Bitbo.io) The Pi Cycle Indicator has predicted Bitcoin market tops in past cycles: 2013: It signaled tops during Bitcoin’s run to $1,000 2017: Flagged the peak near $20,000 in December 2021: Indicated a top around $69,000 in November 2025: As of July 2025, the crossover has not yet been confirmed Crypto Fear and Greed Index Crypto Fear and Greed Index (Coinmarketcap.com) This is an interesting, proprietary tool from the folks at CoinMarketCap. It measures and displays investor sentiment, which is often another clue for buying and selling. From their website : This index ranges from 0 to 100, where a lower value indicates extreme fear, and a higher value indicates extreme greed. It helps investors understand the emotional state of the market, which can influence buying and selling behaviors. The index provides insights into whether the market may be undervalued (extreme fear) or overvalued (extreme greed). By observing the current value of the index, you can gauge the overall mood of the cryptocurrency market. For example, a high value suggests that investors are overly greedy, which may indicate that the market is overheated and due for a correction. Conversely, a low value may suggest that fear is driving prices down, potentially creating buying opportunities. This Fear and Greed Index has only been in existence since mid-2023, so historical data is not available for the previous cycle peaks. However, the all-time high was 92, set in March of 2024, when Bitcoin was at $72,125. The price subsequently slumped for about 6 months and bottomed around $52,000. Despite its limited historical data for past cycles, this tool can still be very valuable. I suggest closely monitoring when it surpasses its all-time high. When used alongside other tools, values above 92 may indicate an approaching market peak. The Fear and Greed Index's current value of 70 suggests we are still early in the final market cycle. Relative Strength Index, or RSI RSI is one of the most commonly used top and bottom indicators. It's a momentum oscillator tracking the closing prices over a given time period. Most charting platforms automatically calculate and display it. Traditionally, when the RSI value is over 70, the asset is considered overbought (sell signal), and those under 30 indicate the asset is oversold (buy signal). But these values are not set in stone, and Bitcoin can stay in the overbought territory for a while before the price actually decreases. Bitcoin's RSI recently surpassed 70, signaling entry into the overbought area and a potential short-term price correction. As an isolated metric, this does not indicate a market top. It highlights the need to combine multiple tools for a comprehensive macro perspective. Final note: These are all tools, not guarantees. Bitcoin’s volatility, market risks, and unpredictable events require extra vigilance during critical periods. Other indicators of market sentiment Watch for signs of retail FOMO (fear of missing out), such as friends and family asking, “What should I buy?” Spikes in downloads of the Coinbase app will signal mass market entry. You'll have experts on CNBC talking non-stop about their latest picks, and crypto will grace national magazine covers. These are signs the bull market is nearing its end. Preparing to sell As the bull market nears its peak, is your crypto 100% ready to sell? If you’re self-custodying, do you have a plan to transfer to an exchange before the end-stage market frenzy hits? Many platforms still struggle with operational issues during times of peak usage, and delays in transferring assets could mean missing your optimal selling window. Have you completed all unstaking of crypto assets well in advance? Polkadot ( DOT-USD ) offers great yield rates for staking but requires a 28-day unbonding period. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) may require weeks to free coins for transfer, depending on the platform. Understand the rules for your staking situation and unbond your coins appropriately before the sale. Do you know the commission your exchange will charge for the sale of your coins? These rules can vary greatly and can erode profit if not anticipated ahead of time and managed. Does your exchange offer an OTC desk with advantageous commission rates for larger transactions? Are you prequalified and familiar with the process? Have you linked your bank to your preferred exchange? Have you made successful test transfers of cash out of your trading platform? What are your withdrawal limits? Many exchanges use a tiered verification system that determines user limits for deposits and withdrawals. Imagine a substantial profit stuck on an exchange but limited by low daily or monthly withdrawal thresholds. Have you planned for taxes? Will your sales be classified as short-term or long-term gains? Are the purchase dates accurately recorded, and will that make a difference for short-term (less than 1 year) versus long-term (1 year or longer) gains? Short-term gains are treated as ordinary income. In 2025, they will remain at seven levels: 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%. Long-term gains have tax rates of 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on taxable income and filing status, excluding the NIIT. See the chart below: Capital gains tax rate 2025 (Nerdwallet.com) The net investment income tax (NIIT) is an additional 2.8% tax that kicks in if your income reaches certain thresholds. Investors taking large profits should plan for this as well. Here's a calculator from SmartAsset to use as a guide for what could be owed to the IRS. Exit strategies Take partial profits at price milestones Just as DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) is often used to build an investment position, setting specific price targets can guide scaling out when selling. What if you wait for Bitcoin to hit $150,000, but it peaks at $149,000 and then rapidly declines? Missing a price target triggers an intense emotional sense of loss, discouraging you from selling during a further decline. Avoid this psychological trap by setting sell orders while the asset value is still increasing. In the example above, targets could be set and triggered for partial lots at $1,000 price increments from $140,000 to $150,000. Trailing stop orders A trailing stop order automatically adjusts the sell price to lock in profits should the asset's price fall. This also removes the emotion from the sales process by automating the transaction, but requires careful setup to avoid premature triggers. Watch for the blow-off top A blow-off top is a sharp, rapid surge in price driven by intense buying pressure, retail FOMO, and speculative media hype. It often marks the peak of a bull market before a significant correction or an outright crash. Look for parabolic price increases, high trading volume, and extreme greed (> 90) in market sentiment. My price targets and timelines Since Bitcoin is currently at all-time highs, we are entering uncharted territory for the next cycle peak. Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, forecasts that Bitcoin could reach $250,000 by the end of 2025. In my view, that's possible but not probable. Many analysts favor a $150,000 target, which seems more realistic to me. In my view, timing the selling window is more crucial than predicting an exact price. Historical trends indicate the most significant price action will likely occur after early September, through October, and possibly into November. If we enter September and Bitcoin is already at $150,000, I will begin taking partial profits but allow the bull run to continue. If Bitcoin prints a massive green candle within this predetermined window, I'll take additional profits, as this may signal the blow-off top. Conclusion Congratulations on riding Bitcoin’s impressive 39% surge over the past three months, but as the market heats up, further preparation is necessary. Now is the time to craft a clear exit strategy, use every tool available to diligently monitor the market, and make sure all the prep work for selling is tested and completed. The process of planning when to take crypto profits not only prepares you for market peaks but also has the additional benefit of clarifying your investment strategies and objectives. Here's to a successful rest of the year, upcoming profits, and progression towards your overall financial goals.",BTC-USD,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-07-15 10:05:01

It built a huge base of loyal believers through a clean app, a social vibe, and the allure of easy crypto. But while Pi made users feel early, it’s still stuck in limbo. No tradable token. No full launch. A community waiting, still hopeful. The buzz may not be dead, but it’s quieter. And that’s exactly why so many Pi holders are now shifting their gaze toward a rising star that’s already delivering what Pi only teased. Why Bitcoin Solaris Is Winning Over Pi Users Bitcoin Solaris doesn’t just offer a vision. It’s executing on it. With real mining, real speed, and real rewards, BTC-S has created an environment that feels familiar to Pi fans, but turbocharged with serious blockchain power. What sets it apart? Mobile-first mining experience through the upcoming Solaris Nova App Active reward generation instead of passive waiting Cross-chain utility and smart contracts are already integrated Massive performance benchmarks with 10,000 TPS and 2-second finality For Pi users tired of watching and waiting, BTC-S feels like what Pi could have been if it had launched at full speed and with full transparency. This Time It’s Not Just a Boom It’s the Rise of Bitcoin Solaris The Rise of Bitcoin Solaris and Its Core Technology What makes Bitcoin Solaris more than just another altcoin is its sophisticated design. It combines a dual-layer blockchain model with a hybrid consensus system. The result? Lightning-fast speeds and ironclad security without energy waste. Base Layer: Built on SHA-256 Proof-of-Work with 5-minute blocks and difficulty recalibration every 1008 blocks Solaris Layer: Delegated Proof-of-Stake running 21 elected validators with dynamic block sizes Cross-layer sync: Ensures validator integrity and transaction reliability Byzantine fault tolerance and long-range attack mitigation for enhanced network safety Optional Zero-Knowledge Proofs for privacy and compliance-friendly use cases You also have smart contract support in Rust, giving developers the flexibility to deploy DeFi, gaming, healthcare, and enterprise solutions at scale. This means that whether you’re a miner or a builder, the infrastructure is ready. One reason so many are noticing this shift is that influencers and crypto analysts are actively talking about it. A detailed breakdown from Crypto League highlights how Bitcoin Solaris is earning real traction, particularly for its combination of energy efficiency and global accessibility. Rewards, Real Mining, and a Smarter Ecosystem Bitcoin Solaris introduces a reward system that doesn’t just benefit whales or early insiders. The payout model is designed to reward effort, participation, and contribution across different devices. 40% of rewards go to Base Layer miners 25% to Solaris Layer validators 20% to token holders actively contributing to the network 10% to a development fund 5% to community-led initiatives Participants earn based on device power, network demand, and the complexity of tasks. You can estimate your rewards using the BTC-S mining calculator , making it easy to plan your mining efforts without any guesswork. Tokenomics That Actually Work Unlike projects that constantly change their supply or token burn mechanics, Bitcoin Solaris is grounded in clarity and structure. Its tokenomics model mimics Bitcoin’s scarcity while delivering greater utility and fairness: Fixed supply of 21 million BTC-S 66.66% allocated for mining 20% for the presale 5% for liquidity 2% each for ecosystem, community rewards, marketing, and staking 0.33% for the team and advisors This model ensures long-term sustainability, giving value back to the people who are building the ecosystem, not draining it. One of the Shortest and Hottest Presales in Crypto With less than two weeks to go, Bitcoin Solaris is racing through one of the shortest presales in the space. Over 14,150 unique users have joined and more than $6.6 million has already been raised. The clock is ticking. Current price: $12 Next phase: $13 Launch price: $20 Bonus this round: 4% Potential return: 150% at launch This isn’t a long, drawn-out affair. It’s a 90-day sprint with the finish line on July 31, 2025. If you’re planning to participate, wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for seamless token delivery after launch. Final Verdict: From Passive Hope to Active Wealth Creation While Pi Network offered the crypto world an invitation, Bitcoin Solaris delivers the opportunity. For users tired of waiting on the sidelines, BTC-S feels like a fast lane into crypto wealth. It combines high-speed tech, accessible mining, and a scarcity model that builds value for the long haul. Pi made people dream. Bitcoin Solaris is where those dreams can turn into real digital gold.

Although the rally has recently slowed around the $0.72-$0.73 level, showing that upward momentum has momentarily cooled, yet the overall technical setup still remains entirely positive. Despite the recent ongoing consolidation, especially when viewed in the context of profit-taking across the crypto space. This sideways momentum in ADA seems more like a pause than a reversal. Also, the underlying indicators also point to more bullish momentum ahead, while the structure built in July remains intact, with support holding firm and accumulation patterns forming. ADA price may still have more upside to explore in the near term. Breakout In Cardano Price Chart Above Key Averages Signals Strength As it is evident that the ADA price has handled strong bearishness for months, being trapped inside this downward wedge. But, this time, ADA crypto breaching above its declining wedges was the biggest feat seen in a month on the daily chart. This breach has relieved many investors who were waiting for this moment in ADA. This move on the ADA price chart isn’t any ordinary move; it’s combined with multiple key factors, which have resulted in developing a crossover in its short-term EMA bands, specifically the 20-day EMA rising above the 50-day EMA. This signals the beginning of a sustained upward phase. Furthermore, the ADA price breakout and sustaining above the 200-day EMA is itself a key long-term indicator of a northward trend. As in the past 3 months, it struggled to hold above this dynamic level, but it is not the case anymore, and recent performance is evident, which clearly suggests a higher degree of resilience. Consolidation Near $0.72 Amid Market-Wide Sell-Off Despite the bullish signals, the ADA price is currently consolidating around $0.72. This pause aligns with a broader pullback in the cryptocurrency market, and Cardano has not been immune to this sentiment. As long-term investors began to realize profits, the Bitcoin, which recently hit an all-time high of $123.2K, dropped more than 5% to $116.7K. Nevertheless, this appears to be a healthy consolidation rather than a worrisome reversal, and it has not broken any critical support levels, yet. It is firmly suggesting that the uptrend remains structurally sound. Accumulation Phase Could Drive Next Leg Higher From a technical perspective, the current price zone between $0.70–$0.72 could act as a re-accumulation zone. Market participants may use this phase to regain strength before making another push toward $1.10, a psychological and technical resistance level. Moreover, another post offers further insight. A recent chart shared by Wyckoff Insider comparing ADA/BTC indicates that Cardano is currently pressing against a strong resistance level. According to the analysis, if accumulation continues and strength rises, ADA/BTC could flip the resistance level into support. Doing so would likely open the door to test the next resistance range in the ADA/BTC pair, which could indirectly support ADA/USD as well. $ADA / $BTC pic.twitter.com/LxLG4ZnrLe — Wyckoff Insider (@Wyckoff_Insider) July 15, 2025",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|ADA|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-15 10:08:49

This isn’t just a tale of lost money; it’s a profound narrative about trust, severe financial misconduct, and the perilous nature of high-stakes crypto futures trading. The individual’s actions have resulted in a staggering 15-year prison sentence, sending a clear message about accountability when public funds are at stake. The Startling Details of the South Korean NHIS Embezzlement Case In a case that has gripped the nation, a former finance team manager at South Korea’s National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) found himself at the center of a monumental scandal. The manager was convicted for embezzling an astounding 4.6 billion won, which translates to approximately $3.32 million USD. This wasn’t a small slip-up; it was a significant breach of trust under the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes, highlighting the severe legal repercussions for those who misuse their positions. The Supreme Court recently upheld the lower court’s stringent ruling, dismissing appeals from both sides and solidifying the 15-year prison term. How Risky Crypto Futures Trading Led to Disaster What happened to the vast sum of embezzled money? The answer reveals a stark warning about the volatility of speculative investments. After a mere 720 million won (about $520,000) was recovered through diligent civil lawsuits and account seizures, the remaining 3.9 billion won (approximately $2.82 million) vanished almost entirely. The culprit? High-risk crypto futures trading. For those unfamiliar, crypto futures allow traders to speculate on the future price of cryptocurrencies without owning the underlying asset. While offering the potential for high returns, they come with equally high, if not higher, risks. This individual’s foray into this volatile market proved catastrophic, turning a monumental theft into an almost complete loss, leaving behind a trail of public funds squandered. The Severe Consequences: What Does a 15-Year Embezzlement Sentence Mean? The 15-year embezzlement sentence handed down to the former NHIS manager underscores the gravity with which South Korean courts view financial crimes, especially those involving public funds. This isn’t merely a slap on the wrist; it’s a significant period of incarceration that reflects the scale of the theft and the profound breach of public trust. The legal system’s firm stance serves as a deterrent, signaling that such financial misconduct will be met with severe penalties. The public’s faith in institutions like the NHIS is paramount, and this ruling aims to restore some of that trust by demonstrating that justice will be served. Understanding Financial Misconduct: A Blow to Public Funds? This incident is a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities that can exist within even well-regulated public institutions. Financial misconduct, particularly when it involves public funds, erodes the very foundation of societal trust. It impacts not only the financial health of an organization but also the public’s confidence in its ability to manage vital services. In the case of the South Korean NHIS, an entity responsible for the health insurance of millions, such an act is particularly egregious. It highlights the critical need for robust internal controls, rigorous oversight, and ethical frameworks to prevent individuals from exploiting their positions for personal gain. This case should prompt all public bodies to review and strengthen their financial safeguards. Safeguarding Public Funds: Essential Lessons Learned The tragic outcome of this embezzlement case offers crucial lessons for financial management and oversight, particularly concerning public funds. Firstly, the incident underscores the inherent dangers of speculative investments like crypto futures, especially when illicitly acquired money is involved. Secondly, it highlights the absolute necessity of stringent internal audit mechanisms and regular financial reviews within public service organizations. Thirdly, fostering a culture of accountability and transparency is paramount. Employees must understand the severe consequences of financial misconduct, and reporting mechanisms should be robust and accessible. Ultimately, protecting public funds requires a multi-layered approach, combining legal deterrence with proactive preventive measures and continuous vigilance. In conclusion, the sentencing of the former South Korean NHIS manager serves as a potent, sobering reminder of the devastating consequences of financial misconduct and the perilous allure of high-risk investments like crypto futures. While the funds may be largely unrecoverable, the judicial outcome sends a clear, uncompromising message: the misuse of public trust for personal gain, particularly when involving such volatile ventures, will be met with the full force of the law. This case stands as a powerful cautionary tale for individuals in positions of trust and a call to action for institutions to fortify their defenses against such breaches.

In a new YouTube video , Jason Pizzino tells his 353,000 subscribers there is a “nice psychological level” for the overall crypto market cap at the $4 trillion point. The crypto market cap (TOTAL) currently sits at $3.646 trillion at time of writing and is down 1.39% in the past 24 hours. Pizzino notes that he’s been looking at 150% of the crypto market cap range in the bull market between late 2022 and the February 2024 high, projected off the August 2024 low. “It’s been working very, very well throughout the market. This is part of the analysis that we use to project price targets and support and resistance levels as well. And the next range we’re looking at is the 2022-2024 range, that 50% level, which often can be a resistance level, comes in at $3.8 trillion, so very close to the market action right now… Further up, looking at around $5.3 trillion. So we have $3.8 trillion, $4 trillion is the psychological, $4.7 trillion, then $5 trillion and $5.3 trillion.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube Bitcoin ( BTC ) is trading at $118,828 at time of writing and set a new all-time high of $122,838 early Monday morning.

In a press release shared with CryptoNews, the firm explains with this latest update Telegram’s 1 billion-plus users will gain direct access to Ethereum-based decentralized finance applications. 15+ top-tier DeFi protocols 50+ Integrations 1B+ Telegram users Full-stack DeFi on @ton_blockchain . Deep liquidity from Day 1. Kicking off DeFi Summer on Telegram Here’s what’s launching on Day 1 pic.twitter.com/PgZrNC1tv3 — TAC ( , ) (@TacBuild) July 15, 2025 The launch includes immediate integration of multiple DeFi protocols such as Morpho, Curve, Bancor, Euler, ZeroLend, IPOR Fusion, and Market.win. These applications will now be operational within the Telegram interface via TAC, a link to decentralized finance. The infrastructure aims to support both crypto-native and non-crypto-native users, This direct connection between Ethereum protocols and Telegram users positions TAC as a conduit for expanded access and usability. What is TAC Mainnet? TAC Mainnet is a new blockchain designed to connect Ethereum DeFi applications with Telegram’s 1 billion+ users. It allows Ethereum-based apps to run directly within Telegram, giving both crypto and non-crypto users access to decentralized finance tools. In short, TAC Mainnet is the bridge between Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem and Telegram’s user base, bringing crypto utility to mainstream messaging. According to the announcement the TAC Summoning campaign, organized alongside liquidity protocol Turtle Club, brought in over $800 million in total value locked (TVL). This early liquidity aims to prevent the usual slow uptake that affects many new blockchain projects, giving the mainnet functional depth from the outset. Structured Mainnet Deployment and Developer Integration TAC’s mainnet rollout has taken place in two phases. The Developer Mainnet, launched in June, allowed developers to deploy and test applications ahead of the full public release. This is followed by the Public Mainnet, now active, which allows Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) developers to launch decentralized applications. Security and scalability have been a main update through TAC’s integration with Babylon, which introduces Bitcoin staking. The firm explains that further technical support has also been formed through partnerships with infrastructure firms including LayerZero, RedStone, Blockscout, Dune, and Thirdweb. Wallet in Telegram Launches Multi-Asset Trading Earlier this year, the wallet in Telegram announced a number of latest updates to its crypto wallet, introducing multi-asset trading and permanent earn options. Updates include a dedicated Trade section, initially supporting assets like TON, BTC, and USDT, with more to follow.

The latest news surrounding Nvidia AI chips and their pivotal role in global tech markets offers a fascinating parallel to the intricate interplay of regulation, demand, and technological advancement we often see in the crypto space. Nvidia, a titan in the semiconductor industry, has just announced a significant development that could reshape the landscape of artificial intelligence development, particularly in Asia. Nvidia AI Chips: Navigating the Regulatory Labyrinth After a period of considerable uncertainty and regulatory back-and-forth, Nvidia is poised to resume the sale of its highly sought-after H20 artificial intelligence chips to China. This decision marks a pivotal moment, following months of intense scrutiny and shifting U.S. government restrictions. The company confirmed it is actively filing applications to restart these crucial Nvidia AI chips shipments, with expectations of receiving U.S. government licenses swiftly and commencing deliveries shortly thereafter. Beyond the H20, Nvidia is also introducing a new “RTX Pro” chip specifically tailored for the Chinese market. This move demonstrates Nvidia’s commitment to compliance while catering to a vital segment of the global tech economy. The RTX Pro is touted as “fully compliant” with existing regulations and is designed to excel in digital manufacturing applications, from smart factories to advanced logistics systems. This strategic offering underscores Nvidia’s adaptive approach in a complex geopolitical environment. China Chip Sales: A Critical Market for Nvidia The H20 chip, while not Nvidia’s most advanced AI processor, holds immense significance due to its legal accessibility under current export controls. It is primarily engineered for “inference” tasks, meaning it excels at running existing AI models for daily applications rather than training new AI systems from the ground up. This distinction is vital in understanding its role in the broader China chip sales landscape. Chinese tech behemoths, including ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent, demonstrated their strong demand by aggressively stockpiling these chips in the first quarter of this year. Their foresight was driven by anticipation of even stricter export controls. The H20’s appeal in the Chinese market is multifaceted: Superior Memory Bandwidth: Compared to domestically produced Chinese alternatives, the H20 offers significantly higher memory bandwidth, crucial for efficient AI operations. Nvidia’s Robust Software Ecosystem: The widespread adoption and ease of deployment offered by Nvidia’s comprehensive software ecosystem make their hardware a preferred choice for developers and enterprises. The resumption of China chip sales for the H20 is a testament to the immense commercial pressure and the strategic importance of this market for Nvidia’s global revenue streams. Understanding US Export Controls and Their Impact The regulatory saga began in April when the Trump administration initially restricted H20 sales. This move targeted chips exceeding specific performance thresholds, including total memory bandwidth of 1,400 gigabytes per second or input/output bandwidth of 1,100 GB per second. Such restrictions had the potential to significantly impact Nvidia’s revenue, with estimates suggesting a loss of $15 billion to $16 billion based on prior Chinese firm expenditures. However, these stringent US export controls proved to be short-lived. A notable development occurred soon after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang attended a high-profile dinner at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort. Reports suggest that in exchange for continued chip access, Huang made commitments regarding new U.S. data center investments and job creation. Within a week of these reports, Nvidia announced ambitious plans to build AI servers in the U.S. worth up to $500 billion over the next four years, collaborating with partners like TSMC. This sequence of events highlights the intricate dance between policy and commercial interests when it comes to enforcing US export controls . The Broader Implications for AI Technology The flip-flopping nature of these restrictions has not gone unnoticed, drawing criticism from U.S. lawmakers concerned about undermining efforts to curb China’s advanced AI technology capabilities. The case of Chinese startup DeepSeek serves as a prime example of China’s ingenuity and drive in the AI space. DeepSeek managed to develop an AI model rivaling OpenAI’s ChatGPT earlier this year, utilizing Nvidia’s H800 chips. While the U.S. banned the sale of these slightly more powerful H800 chips back in October 2023, Chinese suppliers have found innovative workarounds, demonstrating the resilience and adaptability of their tech sector. This ongoing narrative underscores the global race in AI technology development and the challenges of containing its proliferation. The demand for advanced processing power is insatiable, and nations are constantly seeking to gain or maintain an edge, often leading to a cat-and-mouse game with regulatory bodies. Geopolitical Tech: Balancing National Security and Commercial Interests Nvidia’s spokesman, Hector Marinez, conveyed that CEO Jensen Huang has been actively engaging with officials in both Washington and Beijing, consistently “emphasizing the benefits that AI will bring to business and society worldwide.” This statement encapsulates the delicate balancing act at play in the realm of geopolitical tech . Policymakers are continually confronted with the tension between safeguarding national security interests and supporting the powerful commercial engines that drive economic growth and technological advancement. The entire episode serves as a powerful illustration of the complexities inherent in global geopolitical tech . It suggests that in an interconnected world, absolute control over technology flow is increasingly difficult to achieve. Given the precedents set, particularly what has unfolded in 2025, it is reasonable to anticipate further reversals and adjustments in policy as governments and corporations continue to navigate this intricate landscape. Conclusion: A Shifting AI Landscape The resumption of Nvidia’s H20 chip sales to China is more than just a business transaction; it’s a profound indicator of the fluid and often contradictory nature of global tech policy. It highlights the immense economic leverage held by leading technology companies like Nvidia and the relentless demand for advanced AI capabilities across the globe. While the U.S. seeks to maintain a strategic advantage, the commercial imperative and the ingenuity of the market often find ways to adapt. This ongoing dynamic will continue to shape the future of AI development, impacting everything from data centers to the very algorithms that power our digital lives. For those tracking the broader tech market, particularly its intersections with digital assets, this saga offers valuable insights into the forces that drive innovation and trade.

Will XRP Experience a Bullish Continuation in Play? According to market analyst ATOM B, “XRP has just completed a classic inverse head and shoulders pattern on the daily chart — a strong bullish reversal signal. After forming a well-defined Left Shoulder, Head, and Right Shoulder, the price has broken decisively above the neckline resistance zone around $2.60.” This breakout is being fueled by strong bullish momentum and volume, signaling a likely trend continuation after weeks of accumulation and price compression. ATOM B added that a breakout above the psychological resistance of $3 could propel XRP toward $3.40 and beyond, matching the measured move from the pattern’s base to neckline. The analyst added, “This pattern reflects a shift in market sentiment from bearish to bullish, and as long as XRP holds above the breakout zone, dips could be seen as buying opportunities.” Therefore, a potential retest of the $2.60–$2.65 neckline zone should be given a keen eye because it could confirm the breakout and present a strong entry opportunity. At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at $2.86, representing a 26.1% increase in the past week, according to CoinGecko data . The 3rd-largest cryptocurrency by market cap continues to witness bullish momentum after recently surging to a 7-week high backed by rising on-chain activity, institutional use cases, and anticipation of regulatory and technical advancements. Why XRP Hitting the Psychological Price of $3 Is of Keen Interest The psychological level of $3 grabs attention not just for its symbolic value, but for its real-world implications. According to crypto analyst MoonBitz, “XRP might be gearing up for its biggest move in a while. Analysts are watching that $3 level closely; if we close above it on the weekly, $6 is the next big target, and with ETF chatter and big Korean volume… this ain’t noise.” Based on this analysis, the $3 price zone will act as the linchpin for greater heights with $6 being in the picture. A Barrier Between Sentiment and Momentum Psychological price levels like $3 often act as magnets and repel forces in markets. According to analysts, XRP recently broke out of its $2.08–$2.59 range with strong volume, suggesting rising momentum toward $3.00. Holding above $3 would mark a decisive sentiment shift, triggering bullish technical setups and potentially clearing the path to its all-time high of $3.40. Technical Structures Point the Way Chartists highlight that XRP is completing bullish formations: a “highly rare continuation compound fulcrum” pointing to a possible 60 % rally toward $4.47, and indicators like MACD and RSI flashing bullish signals. Additionally, triangle and wedge breakouts reinforce the likelihood of a rally past $3. On‑chain & Institutional Confidence Institutional accumulation is unmistakable: whale wallets holding more than1 million XRP hit a record 2,743 addresses controlling over 47 billion XRP. Many of those coins are exiting exchanges, signaling long‑term hold intentions. Market Psychology & Wider Crypto Correlation Beyond XRP itself, Bitcoin’s rally above $120K boosts altcoin interest. When BTC shines, altcoins like XRP often gain attention, creating a feedback loop . XRP hitting $3 then becomes not just a milestone, but a signal of broader altcoin cycle strength. Conclusion XRP breaking and holding above $3 wouldn’t just mark a price level reached, it would symbolize a shift in sentiment, conviction, and dynamism. Technicals, accumulation, legal clarity, and macro momentum are converging now. For investors, traders, and Ripple’s ecosystem, $3 is a gauge of whether XRP is truly ready for its next breakout.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|ALTCOIN|ATOM,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-15 11:52:43

Previously driven by influencers, the crash of ALT led the community to accuse Crypto Beast of creating hype for a risky token. Altcoin (ALT), a crypto token promoted by influencer Crypto Beast, suffered a rug pull, erasing up to 95% of holders’ value. The influencer later briefly erased the X account @cryptobeastreal. When the account came back, all the previous ALT promotions were gone without a trace. ALT launched on July 9, with a price of $0.018. Within days, the token appreciated by 10X, with ongoing hype from the community. In the past day, however, ALT crashed down to $0.003 after a decentralized rug pull. ALT had only traded for a few days and relied on its Raydium liquidity pool, leaving it extremely vulnerable to price manipulation. ALT traded similarly to other meme tokens, where whales could easily sway the price within minutes. Crypto Beast blames anonymous whales for ALT crash While the ALT community turned the screw on Crypto Beast, the influencer returned with his own side of the story. Crypto Beast posted a list of early wallets, which coordinated to buy up ALT soon after its launch. He then explained that a deliberate sniping and resale event ended up crashing the price. In a lengthy X post, Crypto Beast traced the activities of most of the whales. An investigation into Altcoin (ALT) and why it dropped 85% in minutes: A sophisticated group of snipers, or ""rug pullers"" has made over $2.2 million from ALT by buying early and selling slowly on the way up. Roughly one month prior to the launch of the ALT token, a wallet… — Crypto Beast (@cryptobeastreal) July 15, 2025 The top whale statistics for ALT showed that two of the sniper wallets managed to lock in significant gains. Wallet 8kpY locked in a profit of $535.6K, dumping all tokens on the eve of July 14. The second trading wallet sold ALT for $493.8K. All of the top wallets sold in coordination, liquidating all their ALT holdings. Later, the top whales consolidated the gains into a single Solana address , which holds 2.05M USDC and other meme assets. The trading whales shifted their gains to the wallet, with no further trading or operations. The destination wallet has been active since January, mostly with SOL and altcoin trading. Crypto Beast has denied that the wallets belong to him, instead claiming the whales are unrelated and attacked the token. Later, Crypto Beast also connected some of the ALT traders to PUMP token whales. He believed the group that pumped and crashed ALT is also part of the list of insiders for the Pump.fun token launch. Meme traders link Crypto Beast to older rug pulls Despite the denials, the crypto community still believes the ALT token was deliberately promoted and rugged by Crypto Beast. Initially, Crypto Beast tried to calm the community by stating that whale selling would cause a temporary setback and the token would recover. Just minutes later, Crypto Beast went on to shut down his X account temporarily, as users noted the previous ALT promotions were scrubbed from the history. Just to set the record straight. Over the past week, @cryptobeastreal heavily promoted $ALT / ALTCOIN. This morning, the project rugged — from $180M to under $5M in minutes. In the first hours post-rug, he tweeted that everything was fine: “A whale sold.” “The dev is still… pic.twitter.com/HXfaTRaPB3 — Stefan (@ChickyNuggieMan) July 14, 2025 Investigators also noted that some of the top selling whales did not actually buy ALT, but received the tokens directly. Some of the whales also sold while Crypto Beast was still hyping ALT. A previous project by Crypto Beast, ALPHA, also went through a rug pull after peaking at $180M market capitalization. While the final responsibility remains uncertain, the community has assembled an investigation team with the task of finding the culprit for the rug pull and eventually seeking compensation. Since ALT traded against USDC, it is possible in theory to freeze the proceeds, if Circle cooperates in blacklisting the whale wallets. Investigators are also preparing to involve law enforcement agencies. The ALT rug pull recalls previous meme events where insider whales caused deep crashes within minutes. In the case of ALT, the rug pull erased over $175M in notional value within 30 minutes. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

This wave of buying is very similar to the strategies seen with corporate Bitcoin adoption and is accompanied by strong inflows into Ethereum investment products. ETH also very briefly reclaimed $3,000 on July 11, fueled by rising demand, bullish sentiment, and increasing corporate confidence. ETH Treasury Holdings Explode Ethereum (ETH) is experiencing a big surge in institutional demand. In fact, top corporate treasuries bought more than $1.6 billion worth of ETH over the past month. This means that more than 545,000 ETH was accumulated by Ethereum treasury companies in the last 30 days alone. It seems like rising prices and market optimism are drawing in some institutional interest. BitMine Immersion Technologies , which is chaired by Fundstrat's Tom Lee, now holds 163,142 ETH valued at approximately $480 million. This makes it one of the largest Ethereum treasuries. Lee drew a comparison to Michael Saylor’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy, and suggested that Ethereum treasuries could similarly benefit from what he called a “Wall Street put,” a reference to rising institutional confidence. Quote from Tom Lee Joseph Lubin’s gaming platform, SharpLink , is the largest corporate holder of ETH. With recent purchases totaling more than 50,000 ETH in just a few days, SharpLink’s holdings now exceed 255,000 ETH. Lubin is also the founder of Consensys, and humorously referred to himself as a “self-appointed representative of The League of Extraordinary ETH Accumulator Gentlemen.” Some of the other entrants into the ETH treasury trend include Bit Digital , which now holds over 100,000 ETH, and BTCS, which raised $62.4 million to expand its treasury to 29,122 ETH. GameSquare also announced plans to build a $100 million Ethereum treasury. This wave of accumulation coincides with the large capital flows into Ethereum investment products. According to CoinShares, Ethereum-based funds recently logged their 12th straight week of inflows. The attracted $990 million in just the last week, which made it the fourth-largest weekly inflow on record. (Source: strategicethreserve.xyz ) So far in 2025, ETH funds have seen over $4 billion in inflows, with almost 30% of that taking place over the past two weeks alone. This momentum pushed Ethereum inflows to represent 19.5% of total global Ether fund assets under management, which is nearly double Bitcoin's 9.8% over the same period. ETH briefly topped $3,000 on July 11 for the first time since February, before pulling back slightly. Still, the price is up 15% on the week, thanks to growing institutional interest and a swelling chorus of bullish sentiment.

Will XRP Experience Slashed Selling Pressure? According to market analyst Adex Crypt, “In the past 12 hours alone, more than 14 million XRP have been pulled from the exchange, a major outflow that can’t be ignored. This kind of movement suggests something significant is brewing. Fewer XRP on exchanges = tighter supply for retail buyers.” Therefore, this suggests that more than 1 million XRP exited Upbit per hour. Why is this bullish? Well, when investors withdraw coins from exchanges, it often means they plan to store them in cold wallets or long-term storage. This reduces short-term selling pressure, which supports upward price movement. Upbit was recently in the spotlight after its daily XRP trading volume surpassed $95 million , highlighting the altcoin’s strategic role and growing dominance in South Korea’s crypto ecosystem. Therefore, XRP is witnessing a hodling behavior, which is deemed bullish as the 3rd-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization edges closer to the psychological price of $3. Crypto analyst Lingrid pointed out , “XRP has exploded higher after breaking through the final triangle structure and reclaiming the broken trendline resistance. Price is currently consolidating just below 3.00. A continuation pattern above 2.90 could lead XRP directly into the 3.20 target zone.” At the time of this writing, XRP was hovering around the $2.85 zone. What ISO 20022 Means for XRP ISO 20022 is a global financial messaging standard enabling seamless cross-border payments through richer data, stronger security, and improved compliance. With Fedwire now ISO 20022-compliant, blockchain projects aligned with the standard are well-positioned to become preferred solutions for banks and payment systems seeking faster, programmable settlement options. As a result, XRP is increasingly seen as a natural fit for Fedwire, thanks to its proven ability to enable real-time, low-cost cross-border transactions. With Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) already in use by major financial institutions, ISO 20022 adoption further boosts XRP’s appeal in the evolving payments landscape. ISO 20022 is more than a technical upgrade, it’s a strategic move toward fully interoperable, compliant global payments. XRP, built as a bridge asset for such ecosystems, stands to gain significantly. With the Fed’s shift aligning U.S. systems with global standards, RippleNet can now integrate more seamlessly into international payment networks. Dan Gambardello, Crypto Capital Venture’s founder, welcomed this development and stated , “This is a very big deal for XRP, Stellar, Algorand, Quant, and Cardano. Fedwire is shifting to ISO 20022, a global financial messaging standard that flows data seamlessly across banks, institutions, and blockchains.” Conclusion The Fed’s ISO 20022 launch marks a structural milestone in U.S. payment infrastructure. For XRP, this brings a rare alignment as a token already tuned for ISO‑based enterprise rails just as those rails go live in one of the world’s largest banking systems. This creates a compelling institutional use case, potentially driving adoption, market momentum, and deeper integration into mainstream financial flows. However, long-term impact depends on real-world execution, regulatory clarity, and continued ecosystem uptake. As the Fed’s ISO 20022 takes center stage, XRP is expected to benefit from smoother cross-border operations as the altcoin continues to experience skyrocketing holding.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,XRP|EXCHANGE|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-15 12:00:39

Imagine a scenario where some of the biggest players in finance quietly, yet aggressively, scoop up one of the most prominent digital assets. This isn’t speculation; it’s precisely what has happened with Ethereum (ETH) over the past month, sending ripples of excitement and analysis across the crypto market. Unveiling the Massive Ethereum (ETH) Acquisition Wave In a revelation that has captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts and analysts alike, Kyle Reidhead, co-founder of the popular crypto newsletter Milk Road, recently shared compelling data on X. His report indicates that a cohort of just 10 strategic investment firms has collectively amassed an astonishing amount of Ethereum (ETH) – over 550,000 ETH – within a mere 30-day period. To put this into perspective, these acquisitions are valued at approximately $1.65 billion, representing a significant 0.5% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply. This isn’t just a purchase; it’s a statement, highlighting a profound and growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential. Understanding Institutional ETH Accumulation: Why Now? The question on everyone’s mind is: why this sudden, substantial surge in institutional ETH accumulation ? While the identities of these 10 firms remain undisclosed, their actions speak volumes. Several factors likely contribute to this aggressive buying spree, painting a picture of strategic foresight rather than impulsive decisions. These include: Anticipation of Spot ETH ETFs: The success of Bitcoin spot ETFs has set a precedent. Many believe that regulatory approval for Ethereum spot ETFs is a matter of “when,” not “if.” Institutions often position themselves ahead of such major market catalysts to capitalize on potential price surges. Ethereum’s Technological Advancements: The Dencun upgrade, among others, has significantly improved Ethereum’s scalability and efficiency, reducing transaction costs and enhancing user experience. These technical improvements make the network more attractive for large-scale applications and institutional use. Deflationary Mechanics: Post-Merge, Ethereum’s supply issuance has become deflationary under certain network conditions, meaning more ETH is burned than created. A shrinking supply coupled with increasing demand is a classic recipe for price appreciation. Evolving Utility: Beyond NFTs and DeFi, Ethereum is increasingly becoming the backbone for enterprise blockchain solutions, tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), and even central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) experimentation. Its versatility and robust ecosystem are undeniable draws. This level of interest from major players underscores a growing maturation of the digital asset space, where Ethereum is no longer just a speculative asset but a foundational technology with immense future value. The Impact of Whale ETH Purchases on Market Dynamics When we talk about “whales” in the crypto ocean, we’re referring to entities – individuals or, in this case, firms – that hold substantial amounts of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices. These recent whale ETH purchases are a prime example. The acquisition of $1.65 billion worth of ETH by just 10 entities demonstrates a highly concentrated belief in Ethereum’s future. Such significant capital injections can have several profound effects: Price Floor and Stability: Large purchases can create a strong support level for ETH’s price, as these firms are likely long-term holders rather than short-term traders. Reduced Supply on Exchanges: As more ETH moves into institutional cold storage or long-term investment vehicles, the available supply on exchanges for trading decreases, which can exert upward pressure on prices. Increased Market Confidence: When traditional finance giants enter the crypto space, it signals legitimacy and reduces perceived risk for other potential investors, both institutional and retail. Liquidity Impact: While these purchases absorb liquidity, they also signal deep pockets willing to provide liquidity when needed, contributing to overall market health. The collective action of these firms indicates a strategic positioning, suggesting they anticipate significant upside for Ethereum in the coming months and years. Their moves often precede broader market shifts, making this a critical development to monitor. Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends: What This Means for You The significant institutional influx into Ethereum is a powerful indicator of broader crypto market trends . It suggests that while volatility remains a characteristic of digital assets, the underlying fundamentals and long-term value propositions of established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum are gaining undeniable traction among sophisticated investors. This isn’t just about ETH; it reflects a maturing ecosystem where digital assets are increasingly seen as legitimate components of diversified portfolios. For the average investor, this trend offers both insights and potential pitfalls: Validation of the Asset Class: Institutional adoption lends credibility, potentially attracting more retail investors and further solidifying crypto’s place in global finance. Potential for Upward Momentum: Increased demand from large players can lead to sustained price appreciation for Ethereum and potentially other altcoins that follow its trajectory. Risk of Centralization: While institutional interest is generally positive, a high concentration of ownership in a few hands could, in theory, lead to market manipulation, though the decentralized nature of Ethereum mitigates some of this risk. Volatility Remains: Even with institutional backing, crypto markets are inherently volatile. Sudden sell-offs by large holders, regulatory shifts, or macroeconomic factors can still impact prices significantly. Understanding these trends is crucial for making informed decisions in a rapidly evolving market. Crafting Your ETH Investment Strategy in Light of Institutional Moves The news of substantial institutional accumulation of Ethereum naturally prompts questions about one’s own ETH investment strategy . While it’s tempting to simply follow the “smart money,” a thoughtful approach is always best. Here are some actionable insights and considerations: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never blindly follow institutional moves. Understand why these firms might be buying ETH, and assess if those reasons align with your own financial goals and risk tolerance. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Institutional investors typically have a long-term horizon. If your strategy is similar, this news might reinforce your conviction. If you’re a short-term trader, be aware of increased volatility due to large capital flows. Diversification: While Ethereum is a strong asset, don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Maintain a diversified portfolio across different asset classes and cryptocurrencies based on your risk profile. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Set stop-loss orders or take profit targets to manage your exposure. The presence of large players doesn’t eliminate market risks. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments, network upgrades, and broader economic indicators that could impact Ethereum and the crypto market. This institutional buying spree serves as a powerful validation of Ethereum’s potential, but it should be a data point in your analysis, not the sole determinant of your investment decisions. Conclusion: Ethereum’s Ascent Continues The revelation that 10 firms have collectively poured $1.65 billion into Ethereum over the past month is more than just a headline; it’s a seismic event in the digital asset landscape. It underscores a growing conviction among sophisticated investors that Ethereum is not merely a fleeting trend but a foundational technology poised for long-term growth and widespread adoption. This massive institutional ETH accumulation highlights the asset’s evolving role from a speculative token to a core component of future financial infrastructure. As these whale ETH purchases continue to shape crypto market trends, they reinforce the narrative of Ethereum’s enduring relevance and potential for future surges. For investors, this moment offers a unique opportunity to reassess their ETH investment strategy and position themselves wisely in an increasingly institutionalized crypto world.

According to Coingecko updates, PEPE is trading at $0.00001213, 3.7% less than its value 24 hours ago. The token’s intraday lows came close to Wynn’s liquidation level, at $0.00001175. Record losses did not keep Wynn out of markets for long James Wynn was the most talked about X account in May 2025 when his trading choices led to one of the heaviest collapses in the Hyperliquid trading community. He saw $100 million in long-Bitcoin positions wiped out when BTC’s price dropped below $105,000, equivalent to 949 BTC. Shortly before the liquidation, Wynn had posted on X that he did not practice risk management and didn’t consider himself a professional. In a now-deleted message, he asserted: “I’m effectively gambling, and I stand to lose everything. I strongly advise people against what I’m doing.” Wynn doubled down on his long bets days later with another $100 million bet on Bitcoin, while accusing market makers of targeting his trades to force liquidations. The trader turned to the crypto community for donations to keep his positions alive, and at least 24 addresses responded with funds.

Traditionally known for their robust investments in global tech giants, South Korean investors are now making headlines with a surprising pivot. Forget the usual suspects like Tesla, Nvidia, and Apple – recent data reveals a dramatic surge in purchases of crypto-adjacent stocks, with Circle and Coinbase leading the charge. This isn’t just a minor blip; it’s a significant re-allocation of capital that begs the question: What’s driving this fascinating trend, and what does it signal for the future of global investments? Unveiling the Surge: Why South Korean Investors Are Pivoting to Crypto Stocks According to Newsis, a prominent South Korean news agency, investors from the East Asian nation have collectively poured a staggering $610 million into Circle, the company behind the widely used USDC stablecoin, on the U.S. stock market over the past month. This makes Circle the most heavily purchased foreign stock by South Koreans during this period. Right on its heels is Coinbase, the leading cryptocurrency exchange, which saw roughly $200 million in purchases. This robust inflow into crypto-centric entities stands in stark contrast to the net selling observed in traditional tech behemoths like Tesla, Nvidia, and Apple, indicating a profound shift in investment sentiment. This isn’t merely a fleeting interest; it suggests a strategic re-evaluation of growth opportunities. Why are these savvy investors turning their attention from established tech giants to the more nascent, albeit rapidly growing, digital asset sector? Several factors could be at play: Seeking High Growth Potential: While traditional tech stocks have matured, the cryptocurrency space, despite its volatility, still offers immense potential for disruptive innovation and exponential growth. Investors might be looking for the “next big thing.” Inflationary Hedges and Diversification: In an environment of global economic uncertainty and persistent inflation concerns, some investors view digital assets and companies facilitating their adoption as potential hedges against traditional market downturns or currency devaluation. Familiarity with Digital Innovation: South Korea is a highly digitally advanced nation with a tech-savvy population. The adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology is relatively high, making these investments less alien and more understandable to the average investor. Long-Term Vision for Web3: Investors might be positioning themselves for the long-term growth of the Web3 ecosystem, where stablecoins and crypto exchanges play foundational roles. The Circle Stock Phenomenon: A Deep Dive into USDC’s Appeal The remarkable interest in Circle stock isn’t surprising once you understand its core business. Circle Internet Financial is a global financial technology firm that provides internet-native financial services, primarily known for being the principal operator of USDC, one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing regulated dollar stablecoins. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, USDC is designed to maintain a stable value, pegged 1:1 with the U.S. dollar. So, why would investors flock to a company that issues a stablecoin? The answer lies in the expanding utility and adoption of USDC itself. USDC acts as a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Its use cases are diverse and growing: DeFi Liquidity: USDC is a cornerstone of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and lending protocols, providing stable liquidity for trading and borrowing activities. Global Remittances and Payments: Its stability and speed make it an attractive option for cross-border transactions, enabling faster and cheaper international money transfers. Institutional Adoption: More and more institutions are using USDC for treasury management, trading, and as a settlement layer for digital asset transactions. Regulatory Clarity: Circle has been proactive in seeking regulatory compliance, which offers a degree of confidence to institutional and retail investors wary of the less regulated aspects of the crypto market. Investing in Circle stock is, in essence, a bet on the continued growth and mainstream adoption of stablecoins, particularly USDC. As the digital economy expands, the demand for reliable, transparent, and regulated digital dollars is expected to skyrocket, directly benefiting Circle’s business model. Coinbase Stock : A Gateway to the Digital Economy Ranking as the second most purchased foreign stock by South Koreans, Coinbase stock represents another strategic entry point into the crypto market. Coinbase Global, Inc. (COIN) is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States by trading volume and a major player globally. It offers a comprehensive suite of products and services, including trading, custody, and staking, catering to both retail and institutional clients. For investors, Coinbase offers exposure to the broader cryptocurrency market without having to directly purchase and manage a diverse portfolio of digital assets. Its performance is intrinsically linked to the overall health and activity of the crypto ecosystem. When trading volumes are high, Coinbase benefits from increased transaction fees. When new assets are listed, it attracts new users. Furthermore, Coinbase is actively expanding its offerings beyond simple trading, venturing into NFTs, Web3 infrastructure, and staking services, positioning itself as a comprehensive gateway to the digital economy. The appeal of Coinbase stock to South Korean investors likely stems from: Market Leadership: Coinbase’s established brand, regulatory efforts, and large user base make it a perceived safe and reliable entry point into crypto. Diversified Revenue Streams: While trading fees are significant, Coinbase’s growing array of services (subscriptions, staking, custody) provides more stable revenue streams, appealing to long-term investors. Exposure to Broad Crypto Adoption: Investing in Coinbase is a proxy for betting on the overall growth of cryptocurrency adoption, rather than the performance of a single digital asset. Understanding the Lure of USDC Stablecoin and its Ecosystem The strong performance of Circle stock directly highlights the increasing significance of the USDC stablecoin . As mentioned, USDC is a critical component of the digital asset landscape, acting as a stable and reliable medium of exchange. Its growth trajectory has been remarkable, reflecting a growing demand for digital dollars that combine the efficiency of blockchain technology with the stability of fiat currency. What makes USDC particularly attractive, beyond its 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar, is its transparency and regulatory approach. Circle regularly publishes attestations of its reserves, which are held in a mix of cash and short-duration U.S. Treasury bonds. This commitment to transparency helps build trust, a crucial factor in the volatile crypto space. The burgeoning ecosystem around USDC includes: Cross-Chain Availability: USDC is available on numerous blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, Tron, and more, enhancing its interoperability and utility across the decentralized web. Developer Adoption: Developers frequently integrate USDC into their decentralized applications (dApps) due to its liquidity and widespread acceptance. Corporate Treasury Use: Companies are increasingly using USDC for treasury operations, leveraging its speed and efficiency for internal transfers and payments. The continued expansion of the USDC ecosystem directly correlates with the long-term value proposition of Circle. Investors are not just buying shares; they are investing in the infrastructure of a future digital financial system where stable, programmable money plays a central role. The Broader Picture: Decoding Crypto Investments in a Shifting Landscape This notable shift by South Korean investors towards crypto-related stocks like Circle and Coinbase is indicative of a broader trend in global finance: the increasing legitimization and integration of crypto investments . For years, cryptocurrencies were viewed with skepticism by mainstream financial institutions and retail investors alike. However, as the ecosystem matures, regulatory frameworks begin to take shape, and real-world use cases emerge, the perception is rapidly changing. The current macroeconomic climate also plays a significant role. With global inflation persisting and traditional markets facing headwinds, investors are actively seeking alternative asset classes that offer diversification and potential for outsized returns. Cryptocurrencies, despite their inherent volatility, are increasingly seen as a distinct asset class with unique characteristics that can complement traditional portfolios. Consider the following implications of this trend: Validation of the Digital Economy: The move by sophisticated investors signals a growing confidence in the long-term viability and disruptive potential of blockchain technology and digital assets. Shifting Investment Paradigms: It highlights a move away from purely backward-looking analysis (e.g., relying on past performance of established companies) towards forward-looking bets on emerging technologies and market structures. Increased Institutional Interest: While this specific data point focuses on retail investors, such trends often precede or run parallel to increased institutional adoption and interest in the underlying assets and infrastructure. However, it’s crucial to remember that investing in crypto-adjacent stocks still carries risks. The crypto market remains volatile, subject to regulatory changes, technological advancements, and shifting market sentiment. Due diligence, risk assessment, and a clear understanding of the underlying business models are paramount for any investor considering these opportunities. What Does This Mean for You? Actionable Insights For investors around the globe, the actions of South Korean investors offer valuable insights: Evaluate Your Portfolio: Are you sufficiently diversified to capture growth in emerging sectors? Research Beyond the Headlines: Understand the fundamental value propositions of companies like Circle and Coinbase, rather than just chasing hype. What problem do they solve? What is their long-term vision? Consider Exposure to Digital Assets: This doesn’t necessarily mean buying volatile cryptocurrencies directly. Investing in companies that build the infrastructure (exchanges, stablecoin issuers, blockchain tech providers) can be a less volatile way to gain exposure. Stay Informed on Regulations: Regulatory developments significantly impact the crypto space. Keeping abreast of these changes is crucial for informed decision-making. The Road Ahead: Navigating the New Investment Frontier The significant shift in investment patterns among South Korean investors underscores a pivotal moment in global finance. It’s a clear signal that the digital asset economy is no longer a niche interest but a rapidly maturing sector attracting serious capital. While the allure of stablecoins and crypto exchanges is evident, the journey into this new investment frontier requires careful consideration, continuous learning, and a balanced approach. The future of finance is undoubtedly becoming more digital, and understanding the companies at the forefront of this transformation – like Circle and Coinbase – is becoming increasingly important for any investor looking to navigate the evolving landscape successfully. As the world continues to embrace blockchain technology and digital currencies, these early movers may well define the next generation of investment success stories.

The token just extended its gains, building on a massive 20% rally from last week. The reason for all the excitement? Traders are pouring cash into it. The futures Open Interest (OI) for $BONK has shot up to a yearly high, showing a ton of new money is flooding the market. This kind of action is exactly what a rally needs to keep going. However, it’s not just about the trading numbers. The Solana ecosystem itself is doing great. Its launchpad, LetsBonk.fun, is raking in the cash. It’s collected a whopping $7.97M in just one week, completely outshining every other launchpad on Solana. That kind of success makes the overall mood around $BONK super bullish. What’s Next for the Price? The technical charts are looking good too. Bonk recently smashed through a key resistance level of $0.000024 and is now trading above $0.000027 . If it can hold at that new level, the price could push on further. Here’s a heads-up for traders: the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a bit high at 76 . That’s in the ‘overbought’ zone, so don’t be surprised if there’s a dip coming. However, don’t let that spook you; the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is still looking strong, with a clear bullish signal. Even if we see a small correction, the overall trend is still pointing up. If it does pull back, look for support around the $0.000024 mark. And while Bonk is having its moment in the sun, it’s also worth noting how the crypto space is evolving. The focus is shifting from simple meme coins to those that offer real utility. This is where a new project like Snorter Token ($SNORT) is getting a ton of buzz. It’s looking to be the next big thing by combining the fun of a meme coin with powerful trading tools. Snorter Token ($SNORT): Meme-Powered Utility Snorter Token ($SNORT) is making a name for itself in the crypto world. Unlike many other meme coins that rely solely on hype, $SNORT is a utility token at its core, powering the Snorter Bot. The Telegram-based trading bot is built to give both new and seasoned traders a serious edge. Its primary appeal is its ability to transform the Telegram app into a high-speed trading terminal. You can snipe hot new tokens as soon as they launch, execute quick swaps, and even copy trades of the top-performing wallets. $SNORT has already raised almost $1.9M in its presale and is offering 205% staking rewards, a clear sign that investors are recognizing its potential as one of the best meme coins . A Powerful Combination of Speed and Security Beyond its low fees and ease of use, the Snorter Bot is also designed with security in mind. The platform boasts an impressive 85% success rate in detecting ‘honeypot’ and ‘rug pull’ scams during its beta testing. In a market where new projects can often be high-risk, this built-in protection offers an added layer of security, helping you safeguard your funds and have confidence in one of the best crypto presales . Furthermore, Snorter isn’t just focused on Solana. Its roadmap includes plans to become a multi-chain token. It’s already expanded to Ethereum and has plans to integrate with BNB and Polygon. This strategy will increase its reach and utility, making it a valuable tool for traders across ecosystems. The combination of its fast execution, low fees, scam detection, and cross-chain capabilities makes $SNORT a project that’s not just riding a trend but building a foundation for long-term growth. You can buy $SNORT for $0.0983 in its presale. We predict it could make a high of $1.02 by the end of 2025, and if this is the case, early investors would see a 938% ROI. The Bigger Picture The success of projects like Bonk and the rise of utility tokens like $SNORT are clear indicators of a maturing crypto market. The focus is shifting from speculative assets to tangibility. Snorter Token, with its trading bot and presale success, embodies this direction. It’s an exciting time to be in crypto, but with any investment, it’s crucial you do your own research and understand the risks before committing funds.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BONK|SOL|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-07-15 12:12:15

As of July 15, SEI trades around $0.34 while SUI is hovering near $3.94—marking gains of over 30% and 44% respectively for the month. This bullish move comes amid rising interest in newer Layer-1 networks that promise scalability, low latency, and institutional-grade infrastructure. Let’s dive into the key drivers behind this rally and where prices might be heading next. SEI Network Sees Explosive On-Chain Activity Sei Network (SEI) has been gaining traction due to its focus on high-frequency trading infrastructure and parallelized execution. In July alone, TVL surged past $650 million, while daily transactions spiked over 200%, showing a dramatic uptick in user participation. This on-chain strength has translated into market momentum. SEI recently broke key resistance levels around $0.27–$0.33, and now appears poised to retest the $0.35–$0.41 range. If bullish sentiment persists, analysts see the possibility of a longer-term rally toward the $0.94 mark—a price target backed by macro trendlines and Fibonacci extensions. SUI Sets New Records with TVL Above $2.2 Billion Sui Network (SUI) is another breakout performer in July. The Layer-1, built on the Move language, has seen exponential growth in DeFi usage. Sui’s TVL crossed the $2.2 billion mark this month, setting a new all-time high and placing it in the upper echelon of blockchain networks by DeFi value. This surge in fundamentals has powered SUI past its key resistance at $3.89. With bullish market structure and rising open interest, traders are eyeing the $4.30 to $5.00 range as the next major hurdle. Sui’s developer ecosystem is also expanding rapidly, with new dApps and cross-chain integrations expected in Q3 2025, adding further tailwinds to its price action. What’s Next for SEI & SUI Prices? The SEI price has been maintaining a steep ascending trend since the mid of June and has been forming consecutive higher highs and lows. The latest rise is a result of a breakout from the neckline of the double-bottom pattern. The price is constantly hitting the resistance at above $0.355, and hence, a breakout could be imminent. As seen in the above chart, the 50-day MA & 200-day MA are about to undergo a bullish crossover, which indicates a Golden Cross is on the horizon. With this, the SEI price has set up a bullish case to $0.4, and a secured rise above these levels may pave the way to test higher targets. On the other hand, the SUI price maintains a consistent ascending trend and is trying hard to settle above $4. The SUI price is undergoing a V-shaped recovery and is about to mark the neckline at around $4.34. The MACD shows a rise in the buying volume, which could keep the price elevated, while the RSI has just entered the overbought range. Therefore, the SUI price is believed to reach the immediate highs at $4.35, which could form a strong base and push the price to $5.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|SEI|SUI|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-15 12:12:47

Traders are identifying three breakout altcoins as the clear leaders this season. Unilabs, known for its AI-managed crypto portfolios, continues gaining investor confidence with $30M in assets under management. Meanwhile, Pepecoin price action and Pi Network’s technical structure offer high-volatility opportunities for fast movers. Pepecoin Price Pushes Higher as Traders Target Breakout Pepecoin price made headlines after surging from $0.00000980 to $0.00001327 recently. This strong upward push confirms heightened interest in the memecoin sector this summer. Pepecoin price now consolidates around the $0.00001210 zone, a level that traders consider vital short-term support. Volumes remain impressive, with 30.58T PEPE traded and 382.59M USDT flowing in. As Pepecoin price builds strength, traders are eyeing the $0.00001300 resistance for a breakout attempt. A clean move above could trigger further upside momentum this week. Source : TradingView If it breaks below $0.00001210, Pepecoin price might retest support levels near $0.00001150 or even $0.00001100. Market sentiment remains bullish for Pepecoin price as long as volume holds steady and support doesn’t collapse. In this climate, Pepecoin price action continues rewarding those who move early and trade smart. Pi Network Builds Pressure Inside Broadening Wedge Ahead of Reversal Pi Network is setting up for a big move. Its price structure now forms a right-angled broadening wedge, a known reversal pattern. While the broader market recovers, Pi Network has lagged due to token unlocks. But the chart hints that a reversal could come soon. Pi Network trades above $0.456 and may test $0.40 briefly before bouncing. That zone would form the base for a rise toward $0.66. A breakout past $0.66 could open the door to $1.10, a key psychological level. Source : TradingView The setup offers one of the summer’s best risk-reward entries.

While Solana (SOL) continues to develop a robust ecosystem, the meme coin space built around Solana (SOL) tokens has seen increased volatility and speculative bubbles. In contrast, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) offers a fresh, transparent, and tech-forward approach that appeals to seasoned meme traders looking for sustainable growth. Why Pepe Dollar (PEPD) Stands Out Among Solana (SOL) Meme Coins Unlike many Solana (SOL) meme coins launched on platforms like Pump.fun, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) integrates a groundbreaking minting platform — Pepedollar.fun — that mandates bonding curves and provides real-time tokenomics dashboards. This transparency is a breath of fresh air for Solana (SOL) meme traders tired of pump-and-dump schemes. Additionally, Pepe Dollar’s (PEPD) unique Federal Burn, which permanently removes 29% of its supply, creates scarcity often missing in Solana (SOL) meme tokens. Solana (SOL) Pump.fun Traders Are Making The Shift Pump.fun on Solana (SOL) created a frenzy for meme traders but suffered from liquidity and price manipulation issues.

48288483,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=178052,1752582017,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/48288483.jpeg,AI Data Centers: Meta’s Urgent Quest for Superintelligence Unleashed,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/meta-ai-data-centers-unleashed/,"BitcoinWorld AI Data Centers: Meta’s Urgent Quest for Superintelligence Unleashed The world of technology is currently experiencing an unprecedented acceleration, and for those attuned to the pulse of innovation, particularly within the cryptocurrency and digital asset space, Meta’s latest strategic maneuvers in the artificial intelligence domain are truly captivating. Reports indicate that Meta, under the ambitious and driven leadership of Mark Zuckerberg, is adopting an incredibly unconventional and urgent approach to expanding its critical AI data centers . In a move that underscores the intense demand for computational resources, the company is reportedly erecting actual tents to house temporary computing capacity. This audacious strategy vividly illustrates the fierce competition to build out robust computing power essential for training and deploying advanced AI models, suggesting a future where agility and speed dramatically redefine traditional construction timelines for technological infrastructure. The Urgent Drive for AI Data Centers: Meta’s Ambitious Pursuit Meta’s aspiration to achieve what many refer to as superintelligence is no longer a whispered goal; it’s a declared mission. The company has been relentlessly poaching top-tier AI researchers from competitors, a clear and decisive signal of its unwavering commitment to becoming a preeminent force in the global AI landscape. This aggressive talent acquisition strategy culminated recently in a significant announcement from CEO Mark Zuckerberg: Meta is embarking on the construction of a monumental 5-gigawatt data center, strategically named Hyperion. This colossal project is a profound testament to the immense and specialized infrastructure required to power the next generation of artificial intelligence. The sheer scale of such an undertaking highlights the burgeoning and insatiable demand for dedicated AI data centers , which are not merely facilities but foundational pillars indispensable for developing, refining, and deploying cutting-edge AI capabilities. These centers are the nerve centers where vast datasets are processed, complex algorithms are trained, and the very future of AI is forged. Meta AI’s Unconventional Approach to Computing Power: Tents for Tomorrow The palpable urgency behind Meta’s current AI push is undeniable. According to insightful reports from SemiAnalysis, corroborated by Business Insider, Meta’s determination to accelerate its AI development is so profound that it’s resorting to deploying temporary data center capacity within large, purpose-built tents, even as its permanent, purpose-built facilities remain under construction. This is far from standard industry practice; it represents a radical deviation from conventional infrastructure development, driven purely by the imperative of speed. SemiAnalysis eloquently described this design philosophy as prioritizing rapid deployment above all other considerations. “This design isn’t about beauty or redundancy. It’s about getting compute online fast!” they emphasized in their report. The focus is squarely on “ultra-light structures” and “prefabricated power and cooling modules,” indicating a lean, modular, and incredibly rapid deployment model designed to minimize delays. Crucially, these temporary setups are noted to lack traditional backup generation, such as diesel generators, further underscoring the “get it online now” mentality. This remarkably aggressive strategy by Meta AI vividly showcases the critical importance of rapidly scaling computing power to maintain and gain a competitive edge in the incredibly fast-evolving and unforgiving AI arena. It’s a testament to the belief that every hour of compute time gained is a significant advantage. Building Superintelligence Tech: The Race Against Time Meta’s accelerated infrastructure build-out is a direct and strategic response to its current competitive standing within the global AI landscape. While Meta has undeniably made substantial progress in various AI domains, it openly acknowledges that it has fallen behind some of the early leaders, such as OpenAI, xAI, and Google. The global race to develop truly advanced AI, and ultimately, to achieve the ambitious goal of superintelligence tech , is increasingly becoming a zero-sum game. In this high-stakes environment, early leads in computational capacity and model training can translate into significant, often insurmountable, long-term advantages. Zuckerberg’s explicit unwillingness to adhere to the slower, more traditional construction timelines reflects the exceptionally high stakes involved in this technological arms race. Every single day saved in bringing new computing capacity online translates directly into more invaluable time for training increasingly complex AI models, for rapid iteration on new architectural designs, and for pushing the absolute boundaries of what AI can realistically achieve. This bold strategic pivot towards rapid, almost instantaneous deployment of infrastructure is a clear and unequivocal indication that Meta views accelerated computational resources as the singular most critical enabler for not only catching up but potentially surpassing its formidable rivals in the relentless pursuit of transformative AI capabilities. Temporary Data Centers: A Glimpse into the Future of Agile Infrastructure? The concept of utilizing tents for housing critical data center infrastructure might initially appear unorthodox, perhaps even a bit crude, but it undeniably raises intriguing and profound questions about the future trajectory of infrastructure development in a rapidly changing technological world. These temporary data centers represent a radical departure from the traditional, meticulously planned, and often multi-year long-term construction projects that have historically characterized data center builds. While they are clearly not intended as a permanent, decades-long solution, their swift deployment highlights a burgeoning and critical need for highly flexible, immensely scalable, and rapidly deployable computing solutions. This innovative approach could very well pave the way for more widespread adoption of modular and prefabricated data center designs, empowering companies to swiftly adapt to the volatile and often unpredictable demands for computing power. However, this novel strategy also introduces a unique set of challenges: ensuring optimal and consistent cooling and power efficiency within non-traditional structures, maintaining robust physical and cyber security protocols, and managing the sheer logistical complexity involved in deploying, operating, and maintaining such transient facilities. Despite these inherent hurdles, Meta’s pioneering use of temporary structures could indeed be a significant precursor to more agile, responsive, and adaptive infrastructure models in the future, particularly for scenarios demanding high-performance, short-term computing needs or for initial phase deployments where speed to market is paramount. Hyperion and Beyond: Scaling Meta’s Grand Ambition While the temporary tent-based solutions address Meta’s immediate and pressing computational needs, the company’s grander, long-term vision for AI infrastructure is profoundly embodied in ambitious projects like Hyperion. Meta spokesperson Ashley Gabriel has confirmed that the Hyperion data center will be strategically located in Louisiana, with an incredibly ambitious target capacity of 2 gigawatts by the year 2030. This enormous projected power requirement vividly underscores the inherently energy-intensive nature of advanced AI training, model inference, and continuous operation. Building a facility of such monumental scale involves not only the acquisition of vast tracts of land but also necessitates significant, multi-billion dollar investments in upgrading and integrating with existing power grid infrastructure. The unwavering commitment to the Hyperion project signifies Meta’s deep-seated and firm belief that massive, dedicated, and purpose-built infrastructure is not merely advantageous but absolutely indispensable for achieving its overarching AI goals. It stands as a powerful testament to the unprecedented scale of resources that leading technology companies are now pouring into their AI initiatives, thereby shaping not just their own corporate futures but also profoundly impacting regional economies, energy landscapes, and global technological competition. The Broader Landscape: The Intensifying AI Infrastructure Race Meta’s aggressive and unconventional strategy is by no means an isolated incident; rather, it is a striking symptom of a much broader, intensifying global race for AI dominance. Companies across every sector and continent are investing staggering billions into building out their AI infrastructure, recognizing unequivocally that access to vast, cutting-edge computing resources is now the single most critical bottleneck for driving innovation and maintaining competitive advantage. This relentless race extends far beyond just the construction of data centers; it encompasses the rapid development of specialized AI chips (like those produced by Nvidia and AMD), the innovation of advanced cooling technologies (such as liquid immersion cooling), and the implementation of highly efficient power management systems. The demand for high-performance GPUs, high-bandwidth memory (HBM), and ultra-fast interconnects is skyrocketing, creating complex and often strained global supply chain challenges. This intense competition is driving unprecedented levels of investment and accelerating innovation in both hardware and underlying infrastructure, fundamentally transforming the very foundation of the digital economy. The implications for global energy consumption, environmental sustainability, and even geopolitical competition over critical technological resources are profound, complex, and far-reaching. Challenges and Considerations for Rapid AI Deployment While speed is undeniably paramount in the current AI race, the rapid deployment of AI infrastructure, particularly through unconventional means like temporary tents, introduces several significant challenges that must be carefully navigated. One primary concern is the substantial environmental impact. Large-scale data centers, by their very nature, consume enormous amounts of electrical energy, and the source of this energy becomes a critical factor for achieving corporate and global sustainability goals. Another significant challenge lies in ensuring the long-term stability, physical security, and operational resilience of temporary structures. While undeniably effective for addressing immediate computational needs, they may not offer the same robust level of structural integrity, physical security, or disaster recovery capabilities as meticulously purpose-built, hardened facilities. Furthermore, the immense strain on local power grids and the potential for bottlenecks within the global supply chain for critical hardware components can become significant operational hurdles. Ensuring efficient and consistent cooling for high-density AI servers within non-traditional enclosures, which often lack optimized airflow and thermal management systems, is also a complex engineering feat. These critical considerations highlight the inherent trade-offs involved in prioritizing speed above all else, necessitating careful strategic planning, continuous innovation, and adaptive problem-solving to mitigate potential risks and ensure long-term viability. A Glimpse into the Future of AI Scaling: Meta’s Bold Vision Meta’s audacious and seemingly radical move to deploy tent-based data centers is far more than just a temporary, makeshift fix; it is a powerful and resonant statement about the current, hyper-competitive state of the artificial intelligence race. It unequivocally highlights an era where the global demand for advanced computing power has become so insatiable that traditional, time-consuming construction timelines are simply deemed too slow to keep pace. This unconventional yet highly effective strategy, when viewed alongside Meta’s commitment to monumental projects like Hyperion, paints a vivid and compelling picture of the future trajectory of AI scaling – a future defined by unprecedented urgency, the relentless pursuit of innovative infrastructure solutions, and an unyielding drive for computational advantage. For the broader technology community, including those deeply embedded within the cryptocurrency space, this rapid expansion of high-performance computing infrastructure carries significant implications, potentially driving increased demand for energy, specialized hardware, and even influencing the valuation and strategic direction of related markets. Meta’s bold and decisive step serves as a stark, powerful reminder: the future of artificial intelligence is not merely being envisioned; it is being built today, with incredible speed and an almost desperate urgency.

BTC’s long-term chart shows strength, but Brandt warns of capital strain for future breakouts. Peter Brandt Pushes Back on Bitcoin Collapse Talk Peter Brandt has addressed growing speculation about a potential breakdown in Bitcoin’s long-term trend. In a post shared on July 13, the seasoned trader said that while BTC appears to be nearing a key stage, it does not show signs of a structural failure. It the entire price history of Bitcoin was a fruit, what fruit would you say it was? pic.twitter.com/FPEU1bUvnf — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) July 13, 2025 His chart, based on a parabolic regression model that covers Bitcoin’s full history, raised questions from followers. One user suggested that another major breakout would require capital inflows in the tens of trillions—something they viewed as unlikely. Brandt responded : “Short of a complete re-ordering of the global reserve currency structure, I believe we will soon reach a climax in this advance.” Price Arc Still Holding, But Gains May Slow Brandt’s take signals that Bitcoin may be approaching the upper bounds of its long-term price path. While there may still be room for growth, he indicated that further moves higher will likely demand more capital and may hinge on broader shifts in global markets. Rather than warning of an incoming crash, his comment suggests Bitcoin is moving into a slower phase of its cycle. The trend is intact, but the pace and ease of gains could change. Rising Costs, Slower Returns Some investors argue that Bitcoin is becoming harder to accumulate at scale. As institutional buyers and treasuries commit larger sums, they are receiving less BTC in return. This rising cost has led some to doubt whether sharp price moves are still realistic. Brandt’s view doesn’t rule that out. He points out that without large macroeconomic changes, the next breakout could be tougher to sustain. In May, Peter Brandt also sparked debate with a poll on X, asking followers which token they would invest $100,000 in—XRP or SOL. While some highlighted Solana’s recent chart strength, Brandt noted that he considers more than just price movement. The post BTC Gains Near Climax?

Solana Maintains Strength as Momentum Builds Solana has continued to show resilience even in a slowing market. With $135 million in recent cross-chain inflows, SOL’s support around the $144 mark has become a focal point for traders and analysts. This key level has served as both a springboard and a resistance in the past, making its current positioning even more critical. Crypto Virtuos highlights this support as a positive sign. It indicates that a foundational base may be forming. If the market remains steady, Solana could be gearing up for its next upward move. While it’s already a major name in the Layer-1 category, the current setup suggests SOL could continue to dominate transaction-heavy segments like NFTs and DeFi. For comparison, SOL has an established ecosystem, but emerging crypto presale projects like Nexchain are carving out new use cases through AI and faster, adaptable consensus models. Nexchain Builds Trust in the Crypto Presale Market In a landscape often criticized for a lack of clarity, Nexchain presents a refreshing shift. It offers a presale crypto model grounded in transparency and backed by technology that solves real problems. The $6.4 million already raised highlights strong market belief in Nexchain’s long-term viability. As more investors add it to their crypto presale list, it’s becoming clear that NEX is more than just a new crypto token presale—it’s a foundational layer for the future of decentralized AI. With each stage, Nexchain proves why it’s the best crypto presale to buy right now, setting a high bar for projects aiming to turn presale excitement into lasting ecosystem growth.

48288879,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=766185,1752582420,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/48288879.jpeg,PEPE Coin Is Going Viral Again But Insiders Say This New XRP Rival Could Be The Biggest Runner Of The Year,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pepe-coin-is-going-viral-again-but-insiders-say-this-new-xrp-rival-could-be-the-biggest-runner-of-the-year/,"PEPE news is making headlines once more with a fresh wave of momentum and whale activity, sparking buzz across the meme coin crowd. But while traders ride the hype, insiders are eyeing something much bigger. A new XRP-style token is gaining traction not through memes, but through real-world utility. With serious infrastructure and cross-border use cases, this rising project could be 2025’s most explosive crypto mover. Trading Volume Surges While PEPE Builds Bullish Setup Pepe price is heating up again after a brief dip, bouncing back to $0.000012 despite a 4.25% pullback in the last 24 hours. It’s up 30% in the past week and 37.5% in two weeks, riding the wave of a broader market rebound and the hype surrounding its new Binance Alpha status. That label alone sent bullish signals across the meme coin crowd and a $4.5 million whale buy didn’t hurt either. PEPE price recently broke out of a downtrend wedge and continues to push within an ascending triangle, suggesting this isn’t just a flash rally. Resistance at $0.000013 and $0.000015 will be crucial, but with strong trading volume and buzzing social sentiment, the climb to $0.00002 looks well within reach. Still, while PEPE news rides high, insiders are already talking about what’s next. Many now believe a new XRP-style DeFi project could eclipse even PEPE’s momentum. Unlike meme coins that rely on hype cycles, this one’s backed by actual cross-border payment tech and it’s gaining ground fast among serious crypto buyers. Experts Say Remittix Could Be the XRP Rival That Delivers While PEPE is having another viral moment, insiders are quietly shifting focus to a very different kind of breakout Remittix , a cross-border crypto protocol being dubbed the “XRP rival” with actual utility. It’s not about memes or momentum here. Remittix is solving a multi-trillion-dollar problem by letting users convert 100+ crypto assets into fiat across 30+ countries instantly. Its PayFi infrastructure is doing what few DeFi projects can: powering real settlements for both individuals and businesses. With the Remittix Pay API , companies can accept crypto from anywhere and settle locally without touching a centralized exchange. It’s simple, clean and fully compliant. Key features that insiders say make Remittix stand out include: API-based crypto-to-fiat conversion for global merchants Licensed financial rails with full transparency and compliance Non-custodial mobile wallet with FX tools launching in Q3 $250,000 Remittix Giveaway driving massive early adoption With $16M already raised and RTX at just $0.0811, many believe this could be the next big crypto launch that leaves meme coins in the dust. If XRP’s early days were about promise, Remittix is about execution.

Cryptocurrency enthusiasts are turning their attention to LUNA Classic (LUNC), a token with a fascinating history. Originally part of the Terra blockchain, which began in 2018, LUNC emerged after significant changes in 2022. Terra aimed to create stablecoins pegged to real-world currencies like the U.S. dollar and South Korean won, making global payments fast and affordable. In May 2022, the Terra chain split, launching a new chain named Terra (LUNA) and rebranding the original as Terra Classic, with its native token becoming LUNA Classic.

The goal is to reach 10 blocks per second, and even dream of hitting 100 per second. This could make waiting times almost disappear, making transactions nearly instant. With its innovative approach, Kaspa has the potential to stand out in the crowded crypto market. Features like Reachability help navigate the network, and plans for data pruning make it efficient and scalable. Future support for layer 2 solutions could open doors for advanced applications.

By 2028, ENS could see significant growth, with predictions suggesting a potential maximum price of $86.47 ENS could achieve its highest price yet, reaching up to $283.84 by 2031. The Ethereum Name Service is a network that enables crypto enthusiasts to rename their cryptocurrency addresses into something simpler, making them easier to remember. Renaming crypto addresses through ENS will enable users to recollect and write them quickly. Even though Ethereum Name Service is based on the Ethereum blockchain, it uses its cryptocurrency, ENS. ENS is used for governance purposes on the blockchain network. Users can also send and receive any cryptocurrency with the system’s wallet. The price of ENS has experienced ups and downs since it launched on the market, dropping to as low as $6.7 and hitting an ATH of $85.69. As decentralized identities and Web3 technology are adopted, ENS positions itself as a key player in this transformative space. How will this affect investors’ perceptions of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) token? Will ENS go up? How high can ENS go? Will ENS recapture its ATH soon? Let’s get into the Ethereum Name Service price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Name Service Token ENS Price $22.23 Market Cap $813.7M Trading Volume (24-hour) $42.07 Million Circulating Supply 100 Million ENS All-time High $85.69, Nov 11, 2021 All-time Low $6.70, Oct 19, 2023 24-h High $23.32 24-h Low $21.73 Ethereum Name Service technical analysis Metric Value Price Volatility (30-day Volatility) $ 13.08 (-25.54%) 50-Day SMA $ 21.78 14-Day RSI 30.71 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 45 (Fear) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $ 19.91 Ethereum Name Service price analysis TL;DR Breakdown : ENS is holding above its 20-day moving average on the daily chart and trading near the upper Bollinger band with RSI strength around 60 On the 4-hour chart the token trades just below its 20-period average with support at $21 and a slightly negative MACD histogram Expect a period of sideways action between $21 and $23 before a breakout toward $25 on a sustained daily band breach or a pullback under $21 if 4-hour support fails Ethereum Name Service 1-day price chart ENSUSD chart by TradingView According to the chart on July 15, Ethereum Name Service has broken above its 20-day moving average around $19.73 and is now approaching resistance at $22.65, with the upper Bollinger Band rising to signal widening volatility. RSI sits at a neutral 60, suggesting room to run before overbought territory. MACD’s positive crossover confirms bullish momentum, while daily candles have formed higher lows since mid-June. A sustained move above $22.65 could open the door to $25, but failure here may see a pullback toward $20. A rebound off the middle BB near $18.60 would offer a safer entry before any further upside. ENS/USD 4-hour price chart analysis ENSUSD chart by TradingView Ethereum Name Service (ENS) on the 4-hour timeframe has rallied above its 20-period moving average and is currently probing resistance near the upper Bollinger Band around $23.30, while MACD recently generated a bullish crossover indicating growing upward momentum. RSI action above 50 confirms buyers’ presence though slight divergence hints at short-term fatigue. A retracement toward the middle band near $22.15 could offer support before the next leg higher, with a decisive break above $23.50 likely exposing $25.00 overhead. Conversely failing to hold the mid-band might see ENS re-test the lower band near $21.00. Volume trends suggest cautious conviction among traders. ENS technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $20.13 BUY SMA 5 $21.33 BUY SMA 10 $22.14 BUY SMA 21 $ 21.45 BUY SMA 50 $18.44 BUY SMA 100 $ 19.58 BUY SMA 200 $21.92 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 20.40 BUY EMA 5 $18.95 BUY EMA 10 $ 17.40 BUY EMA 21 $16.96 BUY EMA 50 $19.04 BUY EMA 100 $ 22.17 BUY EMA 200 $23.59 SELL What to expect from ENS? On the daily chart ENS has climbed back above its 20-day moving average and is testing resistance near the upper Bollinger Band around $22.65, supported by an RSI at 60 and a bullish MACD crossover showing renewed momentum. On the 4-hour timeframe however the price sits just below its 20-period average near $22.16, with MACD histogram dipping slightly negative and the lower Bollinger Band at $21 offering support. This suggests a period of consolidation between $21 and $23 is likely before a decisive move, with a sustained break above the daily band pointing to $25, while slipping below the 4-hour mid-band risks a re-test of $21. Is ENS a good investment? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) can be a good investment if you believe in the long-term potential of decentralized domain names and the growing adoption of blockchain technology. ENS offers a unique utility by allowing users to register human-readable names for Ethereum addresses, which simplifies transactions and interactions within the Ethereum ecosystem. Its value could increase as more users and businesses adopt decentralized web services. Will ENS recover? The ENS price has experienced a sharp drop followed by a gradual recovery, indicating some resilience in the market. While there has been a rebound from the low, whether ENS will recover depends on continued buying interest and broader market conditions. Will ENS reach $100? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years, with the price projected to reach $100.37 on average by 2029. This implies that reaching $100 is plausible within the next few years, driven by positive market trends and increasing adoption. Will ENS reach $500? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years. However, attaining $500, while attainable, might not happen anytime soon. Does ENS have a good long-term future? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) shows a strong long-term potential based on current predictions. The price is expected to increase significantly over the next several years, with forecasts extending to $241.53 by 2031. This indicates a positive outlook for ENS, supported by ongoing market developments and growing investor interest. Recent news/opinion on Ethereum Name Service ENS Users Can Now Display Their .eth Names Across Web3 Apps Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has introduced an easy way for users to personalize their web3 identity by setting a primary ENS name—such as yourname.eth —instead of the default hexadecimal address. Users can do this by visiting app.ens.domains , selecting their preferred name, and confirming the update in their wallet. Once set, platforms like Uniswap, OpenSea, and Etherscan will display the user’s ENS name in place of the wallet address. Only one primary name can be linked per address, and while not necessary for transactions, it enhances user visibility across ENS-supported platforms. Want wallets or dapps to show yourname.eth instead of a 0x? → Go to https://t.co/5tArNzDa07 and choose your preferred name → Click “Set as primary name” → Confirm in your wallet Now every ENS-enabled wallet and dapp displays yourname.eth, not the hex. pic.twitter.com/11TzqzoGvi — ens.eth (@ensdomains) June 3, 2025 Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has been integrated into SheFi’s curriculum, empowering Cohort 13’s 3,000+ members to personalize their crypto experience.

After its previous acquisition of the defunct FTX EU, Backpack is now setting its sights on acquiring FTX claims from users in challenging regions like China and Russia. This move, if successful, could redefine the landscape of crypto recovery and offer a much-needed lifeline to those who have struggled to reclaim their assets. Backpack Exchange’s Bold Strategy: Expanding its Reach The cryptocurrency world is no stranger to dramatic shifts, and Backpack exchange has been a notable player in recent times. Known for its innovative approach and strong ties to the Solana ecosystem, Backpack has steadily built its presence. Its acquisition of FTX EU earlier demonstrated a strategic intent to consolidate and grow amidst the aftermath of major crypto downturns. Now, reports from crypto analyst AB Kuai.Dong (@_FORAB) on X, citing multiple sources, indicate an even more ambitious plan: to directly acquire creditor claims from FTX users in China and Russia. This initiative is particularly noteworthy because it targets regions where crypto trading restrictions have historically complicated the process of fund recovery for international creditors. Imagine the relief for users who, despite being victims of the FTX collapse, have faced additional hurdles due to their geographical location. Backpack’s reported plan suggests a direct, streamlined pathway, allowing users to link their FTX account information to the Backpack platform to initiate claims. This could potentially bypass some of the bureaucratic complexities and legal challenges that have plagued traditional recovery efforts. The Complex Landscape of FTX Claims: Why This Matters The collapse of FTX in November 2022 sent shockwaves across the global financial markets, leaving millions of users in limbo. For many, their life savings were locked away, seemingly irretrievable. The subsequent bankruptcy proceedings have been slow and arduous, marked by legal battles and the painstaking process of asset identification and distribution. For a significant portion of affected individuals, particularly those residing in countries with stringent crypto regulations or outright bans, the path to recovering funds has been even more fraught with difficulty. Consider the plight of FTX creditors in 49 countries where crypto trading is banned, as previously reported by Bitcoin World. China, a major market for crypto activity prior to its comprehensive ban, represents a large cohort of such users. These individuals have faced immense challenges, including: Regulatory Hurdles: Navigating conflicting national laws and international bankruptcy proceedings. Lack of Official Channels: Limited or no direct communication channels for foreign creditors in restricted regions. Logistical Difficulties: Challenges in verifying identities and processing claims across borders with restrictive financial policies. Information Asymmetry: Difficulty in accessing timely updates and understanding the complex legal jargon of bankruptcy courts. In this context, Backpack’s reported move to acquire FTX claims directly could offer a pragmatic solution, potentially cutting through layers of red tape and providing a more accessible route for these underserved creditors. A Path to Crypto Recovery: How Backpack Aims to Help The core of Backpack’s reported strategy lies in simplifying the process of crypto recovery . By allowing users to link their FTX account information directly to the Backpack platform, the exchange aims to streamline what has historically been a fragmented and opaque process. While the exact mechanics are yet to be fully detailed, the concept suggests a direct negotiation and acquisition of these claims, potentially offering a quicker resolution than waiting for the lengthy bankruptcy proceedings to conclude. How might this benefit the individual FTX creditor? Expedited Process: Potentially faster access to funds compared to the years-long wait associated with traditional bankruptcy. Reduced Complexity: A simpler interface and process than navigating complex legal documents and international courts. Accessibility for Restricted Regions: A viable pathway for users in countries like China and Russia who otherwise face significant barriers. Certainty: While the terms of acquisition (e.g., percentage of claim value) are unknown, it could offer a degree of certainty in an uncertain situation. This approach represents a significant departure from typical recovery efforts, positioning Backpack as a proactive entity in the ongoing saga of FTX’s collapse. It’s a move that could build immense goodwill and trust within the crypto community, especially among those who felt abandoned by the system. The Power of Solana Crypto: Backpack’s Technological Edge Backpack’s foundation on the Solana crypto ecosystem is not just a branding choice; it’s a fundamental aspect of its operational capabilities. Solana is renowned for its high throughput and low transaction costs, making it an ideal blockchain for applications requiring speed and efficiency. This technological backbone could be crucial in managing the large volume of data and transactions associated with acquiring and processing numerous creditor claims . The efficiency of the Solana blockchain could enable Backpack to: Process Claims Rapidly: Handle a high volume of claim verifications and transfers without network congestion. Reduce Operational Costs: Lower transaction fees on Solana could translate to more cost-effective claim management for Backpack. Innovate with Transparency: Potentially leverage Solana’s blockchain for transparent record-keeping of claims, enhancing trust. By leveraging Solana’s robust infrastructure, Backpack is not just offering a service; it’s demonstrating how advanced blockchain technology can be applied to real-world financial problems, even those as complex as large-scale bankruptcy recovery. Navigating Creditor Claims: Challenges and Opportunities While Backpack’s initiative offers immense promise, it’s essential to acknowledge the potential challenges in navigating such complex creditor claims . The acquisition of claims is not without its hurdles: Valuation of Claims: Determining a fair acquisition price for claims, which can fluctuate based on the ongoing FTX bankruptcy proceedings and market conditions. Legal and Regulatory Compliance: Ensuring full compliance with international and local regulations, especially in regions with strict crypto laws. Verification Process: Robust verification mechanisms are needed to prevent fraudulent claims and ensure only legitimate FTX users are compensated. User Trust and Adoption: Convincing skeptical users, who have already been burned by a major exchange, to trust a new platform with their sensitive information. However, the opportunities for Backpack are equally significant. Successfully executing this strategy could: Boost User Acquisition: Attract a large new user base from among the FTX creditors. Enhance Brand Reputation: Establish Backpack as a reliable, user-centric exchange committed to solving industry-wide problems. Set an Industry Precedent: Pave the way for similar solutions in future crypto insolvency events. Diversify Revenue Streams: Create new business models around distressed asset management in the crypto space. For FTX creditors, the actionable insight is clear: stay informed, monitor official announcements from Backpack, and exercise caution. Always verify information through legitimate channels before sharing personal or account details. This potential path to recovery is exciting, but due diligence remains paramount. A New Chapter for Crypto Recovery Backpack exchange’s reported plan to acquire FTX claims from users in China and Russia marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing efforts for crypto recovery . By leveraging its foundation on Solana crypto and its experience with the FTX EU acquisition, Backpack is attempting to provide a pragmatic and accessible solution for a segment of creditors who have faced the most significant hurdles. While challenges remain, the potential for this initiative to bring relief to thousands of affected individuals and to set a new standard for handling large-scale insolvency events in the crypto space is undeniable. It’s a testament to the industry’s resilience and its continuous search for innovative solutions to complex problems.

48291576,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=788839,1752586231,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/48291576.jpeg,Dogecoin Poised For A Monster Rally Amid Brewing Altcoin Season,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-monster-rally-amid-brewing-altcoin-season/,"In livestream that stretched beyond the hour‑mark, technical analyst Kevin (Kev Capital TA) laid out the most compelling bullish case for Dogecoin since the meme‑coin’s April lows. Speaking to a cross‑platform audience, Kevin argued that the market is standing “right on the verge of a genuine altcoin season,” and that the textbook double‑bottom visible on Dogecoin’s higher‑time‑frame chart positions the asset for what he called “a monster move” once resistance levels yield. Dogecoin Chart Turns Bullish Kevin began by situating Dogecoin inside a broader macro chessboard. This week’s cascade of inflation data—CPI and PPI prints bracketed by near‑continuous Federal Reserve commentary—could inject volatility, he conceded, but the direction of trend is already set by structural forces. “Trueflation is sitting at 1.71 percent,” he noted, adding that the crowdsourced gauge routinely prints about sixty to seventy basis points beneath official Bureau of Labor Statistics data. “Anything under two is good. It means inflation isn’t the story.” Related Reading: Fibonacci Maps Dogecoin Path To $23—Is It Too Far-Fetched? With macro risks in check, his focus narrowed to USDT dominance, the metric he has used all cycle to time rotations into riskier assets. Tether’s market‑share chart has completed a bear‑flag breakdown and is now pressing the 0.786 Fibonacci support band at roughly 4.14 percent. “When money‑flow is deep red on USDT‑D, that’s the green light for altcoins,” he said, emphasising that fresh downside in the stablecoin gauge would coincide almost mechanically with upside in DOGE. A hotter‑than‑expected CPI could deliver a short, counter‑trend bounce in USDT‑D, “but the path of least resistance is lower,” he insisted. The anchor for Kevin’s bullish thesis is an unmistakable double‑bottom on Dogecoin’s weekly chart that formed exactly on the macro 0.382 retracement of the 2024–25 advance and directly atop a multi‑year down‑trend line. “Flip the chart upside‑down,” he told viewers, “and you’d run from it—it looks like a perfect double‑top. Flip it back and it’s a gift.” Volume profiles confirm the pattern: sellers exhausted themselves on the second dip, while relative‑strength momentum created a higher low, an early signal that bulls are wresting control. Kevin’s conviction draws added weight from what is unfolding in the aggregate altcoin indices. Total 3—market‑cap ex‑Bitcoin and ex‑Ether—has slammed into a resistance “yellow box” that capped rallies all spring, yet the analyst believes the ceiling will crack soon. A pending daily golden cross on Total 2 (market‑cap ex‑Bitcoin) marks the fourth of the cycle; each prior cross generated a brief pullback of 9‑19 percent before giving way to fresh highs. “Golden crosses are lagging, so you manage risk here—pay yourself a little—but the trend is higher once the dust settles,” he said. For Dogecoin specifically, Kevin identified a hierarchy of breakout objectives: the local range high at $0.21, the $0.48 pivot from 2024, and the former all‑time high near $0.74. Beyond that he flagged extensions at $1.32 and $2.00, noting that targets lose utility if projected too far in advance. “We analyse the here and now; we let the chart earn the next level,” he cautioned, before reminding newcomers that DOGE is already a ten‑bagger off its June 2024 trough—a feat matched by few large‑cap tokens. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $3.94 This Cycle? This Chart Says It’s No Meme While audience questions repeatedly drifted towards Elon Musk and X and Tesla integration rumors, Kevin waved off the cult of personality. “Dogecoin doesn’t need Elon,” he said bluntly. The meme‑coin’s 10× rebound happened “with zero help from the world’s richest man,” and any future endorsement would likely serve as accelerant rather than spark. What matters, in his view, is liquidity: specifically, the Federal Reserve’s balance‑sheet trajectory and the timing of its eventual pivot away from quantitative tightening. “When QT ends, Bitcoin dominance tops. Then you get the real alt‑season,” he said, pointing to a perfect inverse correlation between Fed asset‑runoff periods and historical altcoin booms. Ending the session, the analyst projected that a decisive weekly close above Bitcoin’s 1.886 fib at $120,000—and a simultaneous rollover in USDT dominance—would ignite the next leg. In that scenario, Dogecoin’s double‑bottom would evolve into a full trend‑reversal, vaulting price into territory last visited during the meme‑mania of 2021. “You haven’t seen anything yet,” he concluded. “Stay calm, stay cool, and let the chart do the work.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.19126.

SEC Settlement: The Seal of Approval for Central Banks to Use XRP,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-v-sec-settlement-the-seal-of-approval-for-central-banks-to-use-xrp/,"Crypto Researcher SMQKE has drawn attention to the broader significance of the ongoing legal proceedings between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. In a recent tweet, SMQKE stated that the conclusion of the Ripple v. SEC case would serve as a “seal of approval” for central banks and other financial institutions to begin adopting XRP through the XRP Ledger. SMQKE pinpoints that such an outcome would reduce regulatory uncertainty around the asset, which has been a key concern for institutional players considering the use of XRP in cross-border settlement and liquidity operations. A visual accompanying the tweet elaborated that settlement of the case is likely to make XRP usage by central banks and other large financial actors far less speculative than other notable cryptocurrency-related events, such as corporate bitcoin purchases. The document noted, by way of contrast, that even Tesla’s high-profile Bitcoin acquisition lacked the regulatory clarity that central banks and regulated financial entities require before adopting digital assets at scale. Ripple v. SEC conclusion —> “Seal of Approval for Central Banks to use XRP through the XRP Ledger.” https://t.co/rCUcHjCiX5 pic.twitter.com/OzslSbdBfD — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 13, 2025 Settlement Process Still Underway As of July 2025, the Ripple v. SEC case is still active. However, substantial progress has been made toward a resolution. In March 2025, Ripple and the SEC announced an agreement that would reduce Ripple’s civil penalty to $50 million, with the company no longer pursuing its appeal of the court’s earlier rulings. In return, the SEC agreed to withdraw its appeal and indicated that it would not pursue further litigation on the same issues. However, the proposed settlement is still subject to approval by the presiding judge, and key procedural steps remain. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to a Times Tabloid report, Judge Analisa Torres declined in June to vacate the injunction against Ripple immediately, citing procedural and jurisdictional reasons. The SEC still needs to complete its internal voting process, which is expected to take several weeks, before filing a formal motion to dismiss its appeal and finalize the settlement. Both parties are expected to submit an update to the court by August 15, making it the likely timeframe for the formal closure of the case. Impact of Institutional Adoption of XRP SMQKE’s remarks reflect a widely held view among XRP advocates that the resolution of the SEC lawsuit will eliminate a major obstacle to institutional adoption. Since the SEC filed its complaint in late 2020, accusing Ripple of selling unregistered securities, many U.S.-based exchanges delisted XRP, and financial institutions hesitated to incorporate it into their operations. A completed settlement, with no further legal challenge from the SEC, would confirm that XRP can be used without fear of additional regulatory enforcement, which could make it a viable option for central banks exploring distributed ledger technology for cross-border settlement.

The attack occurred on the Ethereum Layer-2 network. Arcadia Finance Suffers $3.5 Million DeFi Attack on Base Network Certik first drew attention to the attack in his statement today: We detected multiple suspicious transactions on Base. The attacker stole approximately $1.6 million from Arcadia Finance. This is believed to have been done through arbitrary use of swapdata via the Rebalancer contract. A few hours later, Certik announced that the attack was continuing and that the total loss had reached approximately $3.5 million. The Arcadia team also confirmed the attack and warned users in a post on the official X (formerly Twitter) account: “Unauthorized transactions were made through Rebalancer. Remove all asset manager permissions.” On their website, users were advised to “disconnect Rebalancer and Compounder.” Backed by Coinbase Ventures, Arcadia Finance is a DeFi platform that allows users to borrow and lend, leverage, and swap assets without requiring permission. Certik, one of the most well-known companies in the industry for Web3 security, stated in a report published last month that crypto users and DeFi protocols lost a total of $302 million in May 2025, a decrease of approximately 17% compared to April. Certik is backed by major investors such as Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global, and Goldman Sachs, and is expected to reach a valuation of $2 billion by 2024. *This is not investment advice.

After showing a strong bullish trend and briefly testing the $3 resistance level, the price has pulled back slightly. According to recent analysis , XRP is currently holding up better than Bitcoin on the lower timeframes, despite the overall market cooling down. While a breakout above $3 seemed possible earlier, the odds now hint it might be a bit too soon for that move. If XRP can find strong support around $2.70 to $2.60, there’s a good chance the token will consolidate in that zone, a positive sign for the next possible push higher. Market sentiment will also hinge on upcoming inflation data, which has the potential to shake up crypto prices in the short term. If the broader market stays steady and XRP manages to hold above $2.70, a move past $3 could still happen later this month. But for now, the focus is on whether XRP can defend key support levels before attempting another breakout. Here’s what to expect: Short-term: Likely to dip towards $2.70–$2.60 Medium-term: Consolidation above $2.70 could open doors for a future breakout Watch for: Inflation data impact and overall crypto market sentiment Analyst Casi Trades shared that over the weekend, XRP perfectly retested the $2.69 support level and is now challenging the crucial $3 resistance.

This development isn’t just another headline; it’s a powerful indicator of how established financial entities are strategically integrating cryptocurrencies into their portfolios. Let’s delve into what this means for the market and the future of institutional engagement with Bitcoin. What Does This Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition Mean for Hilbert Group? The news, initially shared by @btcNLNico on X, reveals that Hilbert Group , a prominent digital asset investment firm listed on Nasdaq, has successfully acquired an additional 233 Bitcoin from Deus X Capital, a well-known operator in the crypto and fintech sectors. This latest purchase brings their total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 430 BTC. But why is this particular Bitcoin acquisition so noteworthy? Increased Exposure: By nearly doubling its BTC reserves, Hilbert Group is signaling a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its role as a core asset in a diversified portfolio. Strategic Positioning: This isn’t a speculative gamble; it’s a calculated move by a publicly traded company to deepen its commitment to the digital asset class, potentially leveraging Bitcoin’s deflationary characteristics and growth potential. Market Confidence: When a Nasdaq-listed entity makes such a public and substantial move, it sends a powerful message to the broader market, potentially encouraging other institutional players to follow suit. This expansion of their BTC holdings is a clear testament to Hilbert Group’s strategic vision, positioning them as a key player in the evolving landscape where traditional finance meets decentralized innovation. Why Are Institutional Crypto Investments on the Rise? The trend of institutional adoption in the cryptocurrency market is undeniable, and Hilbert Group’s latest move is a prime example. What’s driving this surge in institutional crypto interest? Several factors contribute to this growing appetite among major financial players: Bitcoin as a Store of Value and Inflation Hedge In an economic climate marked by inflation concerns and volatile traditional markets, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a viable store of value, akin to digital gold. Its decentralized nature and fixed supply make it an attractive alternative for institutions seeking to preserve capital and hedge against economic uncertainties. The narrative around Bitcoin’s scarcity continues to resonate with investors looking beyond conventional assets. Maturing Market Infrastructure and Regulatory Clarity The cryptocurrency market has come a long way from its nascent days. We now see more robust infrastructure, including regulated exchanges, secure custody solutions, and clearer regulatory frameworks emerging in various jurisdictions. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. earlier this year, for instance, significantly lowered the barrier to entry for institutional investors, providing a familiar and regulated investment vehicle for gaining exposure to Bitcoin holdings . Diversification and Growth Potential Institutions are constantly seeking new avenues for diversification and growth. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, offer a unique risk-reward profile that can complement existing portfolios. While volatility remains a factor, the long-term growth trajectory and potential for significant returns make them an appealing asset class for those with a strategic, forward-looking investment horizon. How Does a Digital Asset Firm Navigate the Volatile Crypto Market? Being a dedicated digital asset firm in the cryptocurrency space requires a unique blend of expertise, risk management, and foresight. For companies like Hilbert Group, increasing their Bitcoin reserves isn’t a spur-of-the-moment decision but a result of careful analysis and strategic planning. How do they manage to thrive in such a dynamic environment? Robust Risk Management Frameworks Institutions employ sophisticated risk management strategies to mitigate the inherent volatility of the crypto market. This includes diversification beyond just Bitcoin, setting clear allocation limits, utilizing advanced trading algorithms, and implementing stringent security protocols to protect their digital assets. Deep Market Research and Expertise A successful digital asset firm invests heavily in research and development, maintaining a deep understanding of market trends, technological advancements, and regulatory shifts. This allows them to identify promising opportunities and make informed decisions, such as a strategic Bitcoin acquisition , that align with their long-term objectives. Long-Term Vision Over Short-Term Fluctuations While daily price movements grab headlines, established firms like Hilbert Group typically adopt a long-term investment philosophy. They focus on the fundamental value proposition of assets like Bitcoin and the transformative potential of blockchain technology, rather than reacting to every market swing. This patient approach is crucial for accumulating substantial BTC holdings and realizing significant returns over time. What Does This Signal for the Future of Bitcoin and Institutional Adoption? The actions of firms like Hilbert Group provide valuable insights into the evolving perception of Bitcoin within mainstream finance. Their latest Bitcoin acquisition is more than just a transaction; it’s a harbinger of things to come. So, what might the future hold? Continued Institutional Inflow As more firms like Hilbert Group demonstrate successful integration of digital assets, we can anticipate a ripple effect. The increased transparency and regulatory clarity will likely attract even more pension funds, endowments, and corporate treasuries to allocate a portion of their portfolios to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Mainstreaming of Digital Assets The distinction between ‘traditional’ and ‘digital’ assets will continue to blur. Cryptocurrencies will increasingly be viewed as a legitimate and essential component of a well-rounded investment strategy, moving beyond niche status to become a staple in institutional portfolios. Impact on Market Liquidity and Stability Greater institutional participation typically brings increased liquidity and potentially reduced volatility to a market. As larger, more stable entities commit capital, the market could become more resilient to sudden price swings, fostering a more mature and predictable environment for all participants. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor While most individual investors don’t operate on the scale of a Nasdaq-listed digital asset firm , there are valuable lessons to be learned from Hilbert Group’s strategic moves: Embrace a Long-Term Perspective: Institutions focus on the bigger picture. Consider Bitcoin as a long-term investment rather than a short-term trade. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin is volatile. Only invest what you can afford to lose and ensure it aligns with your personal financial goals. Diversify Wisely: While Bitcoin is dominant, explore other promising digital assets. However, always conduct thorough research. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market developments, regulatory changes, and institutional moves. Knowledge is power in this rapidly evolving space. A Bold Step Forward for Digital Assets Hilbert Group’s decision to significantly boost its Bitcoin holdings with an additional 233 BTC from Deus X Capital is a powerful statement. It underscores the growing legitimacy and strategic importance of Bitcoin within the financial landscape. As a Nasdaq-listed digital asset firm , their actions provide a clear signal of confidence, not just in Bitcoin, but in the entire future of institutional crypto investment. This move highlights a broader trend where traditional finance is increasingly recognizing the undeniable value and potential of decentralized assets. It’s a fascinating time to witness the convergence of established financial powerhouses and the revolutionary world of cryptocurrencies, paving the way for a more integrated and digitally-driven financial future.

Posting on X, he addressed growing concerns about Bitcoin’s long-term future, offering a grounded take based on decades of trading experience and a solid grasp of macroeconomic trends. His latest comments are changing the conversation. Instead of predicting a crash, Brandt suggests Bitcoin may be nearing the natural end of its current growth cycle. It’s a realistic yet hopeful message, and one that matters for investors, traders, and crypto watchers alike. Is Bitcoin’s Parabolic Growth Still Realistic? The debate started when Brandt shared a parabolic regression chart of Bitcoin’s price history on July 13. The chart tracks BTC’s rise since inception, but not everyone was convinced by what it showed. One user pointed out that for Bitcoin to keep following the same steep upward path, it would need capital inflows in the tens of trillions of dollars, a level that feels unlikely in the current economic environment. They also noted that institutional and corporate buyers are now paying more while getting less, raising doubts about whether Bitcoin can keep breaking out like it used to.

He agreed that Bitcoin could be nearing the peak of its current growth arc unless there’s a major shift in the global reserve currency system. I tend to agree. Short of a complete re-ordering of the global reserve currency structure I believe we will soon reach a climax in this advance — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) July 14, 2025 This moment marks a rare intersection where technical charts and macroeconomic realities align. And coming from someone as seasoned as Brandt, it carries weight. He isn’t saying Bitcoin will crash. But he is pointing out that the fast, exponential growth we’ve seen over the past decade might be slowing down, at least for now. Not the End But Definitely a New Phase Brandt’s response shifts the narrative. While critics argue that rising inefficiencies and long-term resistance levels suggest a blow-off top, he sees something different. Bitcoin is going forward but gains won’t come easy.

For months, Trump has been openly critical of Powell, accusing him of holding back the U.S. economy by refusing to lower interest rates. He has even suggested firing Powell in the past, calling him “very bad for the country.” Now, the heat has turned up even more, as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has publicly called on Powell to fully step down once his term as Fed Chair ends in May 2026. Bessent Says Powell Should Make a Clean Exit In a recent interview, Secretary Bessent made it clear that the tradition of a Fed Chair stepping down completely should be followed. He warned that if Powell stayed on the Fed’s board after finishing his term as Chair, it could confuse the markets. There’s already chatter that Trump reportedly is considering a “shadow chair” working behind the scenes while Powell is still around. Bessent confirmed that the formal process to find a new Fed Chair has already begun, but added that the final choice will be made on Trump’s timeline. He also assured that many good candidates are being considered, both from inside and outside the Fed. Who’s Next in Line? While Powell’s still got time left, the big question is, who’s going to fill his chair? According to Bessent, the hunt is officially on, and President Trump is flipping through names. Some are insiders, some are new faces. One thing’s clear: Wall Street and Main Street are both watching, because whoever sits in that seat will set the course for everyone’s wallets. CPI Data Surge To 2.7% Adding to the uncertainty, the latest U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed inflation at 2.7% , higher than expected and the first time in five months that inflation has come in above forecasts. This rise in inflation puts more pressure on the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, Bessent urged people not to panic over a single Consumer Price Index (CPI) report.

The crypto fund, which recently bought $100 million worth of WLFI tokens from World Liberty Financial (WLF), described such claims as false and misinformation. According to a post on its official X account, the fund operates independently. It has no ties with any unrelated entity, while its co-founder and CEO, Dave Lee, joined the team in April 2025. It said: “Aqua1 operates independently and has no equity, financial, or operational ties to any unrelated entity.” The post follows recent accusations that Aqua1 co-founder Dave Lee might be the same person as David Li, a former employee of Hong Kong-based Web3Port . Web3Port was accused of market manipulation earlier this year when it dumped MOVE tokens, leading to several exchanges banning the firm. However, Aqua1 denied such connections, noting that it has several institutional partners in the Middle East and is working with them on several initiatives. The fund stated that it cannot publicly disclose information yet because of ongoing regulatory and compliance procedures. Interestingly, Dave Lee also corroborated the Aqua1 post, adding that he left his previous employer to take a founding role in Aqua1 earlier this year. However, he did not name the former employer. Lee said: “I stepped away from my role at my previous employer earlier this year due to fundamental differences in vision and strategy, and took on a founding role at Aqua1 — a platform I believe in and will help shape as part of a broader structure we are establishing in the UAE.” Meanwhile, both Aqua1 and Lee posts mentioned that they will take legal action for any factually incorrect or defamatory coverage to protect their reputation. Independent journalist claims Aqua1 is connected to Web3Port Speculations about any connection between the two firms surfaced on July 14 when independent journalist Jacob Silverman alleged that Aqua1 co-founder and CEO Dave Lee is the same person as David Jia Hua Li of Web3Port, an acceleration partner for the company. Silverman claimed that digital footprints suggest a connection between the two projects. He noted that Web3Port and Aqua1 websites are hosted on the same AWS server. The server also hosts the website for BlockRock, a real-world assets tokenization platform to which Dave Lee is also connected. Meanwhile, the journalist added that digital footprints suggest that Dave Lee and David Li are the same person, noting that both appear to have graduated from business school in New York and have a finance background. Although some questioned the likelihood of the connection, particularly the fact that Aqua1 was able to invest $100 million in WLFI, Silverman argued that this is why the whole transaction is worth investigating, as it suggests corruption. However, Lee claimed in an earlier post that Aqua1 has been working behind the scenes with WLF for a while now and is only becoming public with the $100 million investment in the crypto project. WLFI set to become tradable with ongoing vote Meanwhile, the controversy around Aqua1 investment in WLF is only one of the many controversies that have trailed crypto projects connected to President Trump. For instance, Bloomberg recently claimed in a story that Binance was involved in creating USD1, the stablecoin launched by WLF a few months ago. The story suggested that the creation of USD1 and its use in the funding of $2 billion investment by the UAE sovereign fund into Binance might be connected with recent efforts by Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao’s application for a presidential pardon. Zhao has since debunked the claims, describing them as false and misinformation and attributing them to a competitor in the industry. Despite the speculations, World Liberty Financial continues expanding its offerings. The project, which already has a stablecoin and is working on RWA, recently launched a proposal to make its token WLFI tradable months after it initially launched. The majority of token holders appear to support the proposal, with 99.94% of votes cast being for enabling tradability for the token. Voting started on July 9 and is set to end by July 16.

As the meme coin market becomes more developed, however, other projects are becoming strong rivals to Dogecoin. Top candidates among them include Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), and Little Pepe (LILPEPE), and these projects can be distinguished due to their distinctive characteristics and 2025 perspectives. 1. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The ‘Dogecoin Killer’ Continues to Rise SHIB is a meme coin operating on the Ethereum blockchain, becoming one of the most well-known ones. However, SHIB shows a solid bullish momentum lately, increasing its price by 8.83% within 24 hours to $0.00001358. This is a strong increase that shows the project is gaining further community and ecosystem support, respectively. Source| X The 24-hour trading volume for SHIB saw an impressive 54.33% increase, highlighting growing market interest. With a market cap of $8 billion, SHIB is gaining significant traction as a major player in the meme coin space. 2. Pepe (PEPE): The Meme Coin with Explosive Growth Pepe (PEPE) meme coin has also topped the list and has gained 15.68% within the last 24 hours. The price of the coin has increased to $0.00001283 against the previous price of $0.00001106, making it one of the most active coins in the market. The rise in market cap to $5.39 billion and a staggering 81.34% increase in trading volume indicate growing investor confidence. Source| Coinmarketcap What sets Pepe apart is its ability to quickly capture the meme culture and turn it into a mainstream asset. With strong market capitalization and steady price growth, it has all the signs of being a major competitor to Dogecoin. If the current bullish momentum continues, Pepe might soon challenge Dogecoin’s position in the market. 3. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin Built on Real Blockchain Infrastructure Whilst most of the meme coins are simply attempting to go along with the hype train, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is already carving out its path by building a custom blockchain specifically designed to support meme assets. The given project operates on the blockchain of Layer 2 called the Little Pepe Chain, aimed at trading meme tokens. The process addresses the two most common issues with large transaction fees and constant transaction delays that are an occurrence with meme coins on Ethereum. At Stage 5 of its presale, Little Pepe has already secured over 5.4 million dollars and sold 4.4 billion tokens, which seems to be the mark of high demand and investor confidence. The token price stands at $0.0014 and will rise to a new mark of $0.0015 in the next stage, indicating that more people are becoming interested in the project. Little Pepe has a clear investment direction: it strives to offer utility, and its chain was created to offer low-cost, high-speed transactions and serve the interests of meme lovers and developers. As an increasing number of people start realizing how much they can do with it, Little Pepe can do better than traditional meme coins such as Dogecoin. Apart from the utility driven theme, the project also offers a $777k giveaway , where the top 10 contributors each will receive $77k worth of LILPEPE tokens by being eligible with a minimum of $100 investment in the presale.

This monumental event marks the largest daily Bitcoin profit realization observed so far this year, underscoring a pivotal moment in the current market cycle. But what does this massive inflow of cash mean for the broader market, and who exactly is driving this surge? Understanding Realized Profit: What Does it Mean for Bitcoin Investors? Before diving into the specifics, let’s clarify what ‘ realized profit ‘ truly signifies in the world of Bitcoin. Essentially, it refers to the total amount of profit taken by investors when they sell their BTC for a price higher than their acquisition cost. This metric is crucial because it provides a clear picture of actual capital flowing out of the Bitcoin network and into fiat or other assets, rather than just paper gains. Glassnode, a leading on-chain analytics platform, meticulously tracks these movements by analyzing transactions directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. Their comprehensive Glassnode data offers invaluable insights into investor behavior, market sentiment, and potential shifts in supply and demand dynamics. When Glassnode reports such a significant figure, it’s a strong indicator of market activity and investor confidence, or perhaps, strategic repositioning. Glassnode Data Unveils Key Insights: Who’s Cashing In? The recent $3.5 billion profit realization isn’t just a big number; it’s a story of different investor cohorts making strategic moves. According to the detailed analysis provided by Glassnode, the profits were not evenly distributed among all market participants. Here’s the breakdown: Long-Term Holders (LTHs): These are the seasoned Bitcoin investors who have held their BTC for more than 155 days. They accounted for a substantial $1.96 billion of the total realized profits, representing approximately 56% of the overall sum. Short-Term Holders (STHs): In contrast, STHs are newer entrants or more active traders who have held their Bitcoin for 155 days or less. They contributed $1.54 billion to the realized profits, making up around 44% of the total. The fact that long-term holders are leading this profit-taking spree is particularly noteworthy. It suggests a degree of conviction and strategic decision-making from those who have weathered previous market cycles and held through significant volatility. This trend offers critical insights into the current market structure. The Dominance of Long-Term Holders: A Sign of Strength or Caution? When long-term holders decide to realize profits on such a grand scale, it can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, it indicates that these investors are seeing substantial gains, which validates their long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s value proposition. Their willingness to sell at current prices suggests they believe the market has reached a point where it’s opportune to lock in gains. Historically, significant profit realization by LTHs can precede periods of market consolidation or even minor corrections, as large amounts of supply re-enter circulation. However, it can also be a healthy sign of a mature market where strong hands are distributing assets to new demand, preventing overheating and allowing for sustainable growth. The market’s ability to absorb such a large amount of selling pressure from LTHs without a significant price drop would indicate robust underlying demand. Are Short-Term Holders Following Suit? Analyzing Recent Bitcoin Profit-Taking While long-term holders took the lion’s share, the contribution from short-term holders to the overall Bitcoin profit realization is also significant. STHs are often more reactive to price movements, and their profit-taking can signal a more immediate response to recent price surges. Their behavior can sometimes indicate a ‘top’ in the short-term, as newer investors or traders cash out quickly. However, the fact that LTHs’ realized profits surpassed STHs’ by a notable margin suggests that the market isn’t solely being driven by speculative short-term trading. It implies a more fundamental distribution from long-held supply, which could be absorbed by new demand coming into the market, eager to buy Bitcoin even at higher prices. Navigating the Market: What Does This Glassnode Data Imply for Your Strategy? For investors, understanding this latest Glassnode data is paramount. It provides a clearer picture of who is selling and why, allowing for more informed decision-making. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Demand: The key question now is whether there’s enough new demand to absorb this influx of realized profits without a significant price correction. Strong institutional and retail interest would be crucial. Volatility Expectation: Large profit-taking events can sometimes lead to increased market volatility as supply re-enters the market. Investors should be prepared for potential price swings. On-Chain Metrics are Key: This event highlights the importance of on-chain analytics. Platforms like Glassnode offer unparalleled transparency into market dynamics that traditional financial metrics simply cannot provide. Long-Term vs. Short-Term Perspective: Evaluate your own investment horizon. If you’re a long-term holder, this might be a healthy distribution. If you’re a short-term trader, it might signal a need for caution. The $3.5 billion in realized profits over 24 hours is a testament to Bitcoin’s incredible performance and the substantial gains accumulated by its investors. Led primarily by long-term holders, this event showcases a significant redistribution of wealth within the Bitcoin ecosystem. While such large-scale profit-taking warrants careful observation, it also underscores the maturity of the Bitcoin market and the effectiveness of on-chain analytics in providing a transparent view of investor behavior.

The firm holds a stake of nearly 8%, worth $9.26 billion. It includes more than 20 million shares. The largest stake—5.7 million shares—is in the Total Stock Market Index Fund (VITSX). Vanguard did not select Strategy stock in a targeted way. The purchase was automatic because the company is included in various stock indexes. Vanguard's passive funds are required to track these indexes by purchasing the corresponding assets. The investment firm's management has repeatedly expressed its aversion to cryptocurrencies. The company called them ”unsuitable” for long-term investors and refused to add a spot Bitcoin ETF to its platform. ”We don't believe this asset has a place in the portfolio,” said Vanguard's former CEO Tim Buckley. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas called the situation ironic. ”God has a sense of humor. By choosing the path of index funds, Vanguard is obligated to own all stocks—whether it likes them or not,” he explained. Strategy founder Michael Saylor sees the event as ”a powerful signal of growing institutional support for Bitcoin.” In his opinion, it reflects the acceptance of digital gold as a reserve asset by the traditional financial community. Strategy is the largest corporate holder of the first cryptocurrency. At the time of writing, the company owns 601,550 BTC, representing over 2.8% of Bitcoin's total supply and valued at more than $73 billion. The company recently acquired an additional 4,225 BTC for $472.5 million, highlighting its ongoing aggressive accumulation strategy. As Bitcoin prices hover near all-time highs, Strategy's total unrealized gains exceed $30 billion, illustrating both the scale and impact of its bold treasury approach.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-15 13:50:38

It’s here, and it’s becoming the bedrock of modern civilization. Just as electricity transformed the 20th century and the Internet transformed the 21st, AI is reshaping how we work, govern, and live. Soon, every major institution, from hospitals to the military, will integrate AI into their core operations, raising the stakes for the infrastructure that underpins it. Despite this demand, our infrastructure isn’t keeping pace. In 2024, U.S. data centers used ~200 terawatt-hours of electricity , enough to power Thailand for a year. The same estimate holds that by 2028, AI power usage is predicted to reach between 165 and 326 terawatt-hours annually, enough to power 22% of U.S. households. AI workloads are pushing energy and compute systems well beyond their limits, creating an exponential demand that leaves our power grid lagging behind as it struggles to scale even incrementally. This mismatch is more than a technical issue. As demand for AI ramps up, these bottlenecks in national energy supply and compute access will slow development across every sector, limiting its transformative potential. The United States is leading, for now. But we are in a sprint, and China is gaining ground. Their DeepSeek model R1 rivals top-tier U.S. models . DeepSeek’s success proves that speed, scale and efficiency can radically shift the balance of global AI power. China’s AI push is well-funded, coordinated and strategic. If DeepSeek is any indication of China’s momentum, we are far behind them. It won’t matter who leads in algorithms if the U.S. keeps treating infrastructure as an afterthought, because we’re on track to lose the platform war. The future of AI must be built on freedom, transparency, and trust, not surveillance and control. That is America’s edge—and to that we must prioritize the energy crisis it’s creating. In this context, massive, centralized data centers are obsolete. They’re rigid, expensive, and confined to one geographic location. Even worse, they create single points of failure . If one power grid goes down or is overheated, an entire segment of the country is plunged into a technological dark age. By contrast, decentralized systems free our potential , allowing American innovation to scale with agility. Smaller compute clusters can run near sources of localized renewable energy, such as solar, wind, or geothermal energy, or take advantage of underutilized compute power sitting idle in homes, campuses, and communities. Decentralized systems also better position American technology to survive in a world where threats are increasingly moving into the digital space. In times of crisis, or cyberattacks from nefarious actors , distributing compute across individual nodes ensures continuity, whereas centralized systems collapse. The way forward So what’s the path forward? We start by incentivizing distributed infrastructure, making it easier and more profitable to build beyond hyperscale facilities. We fund federal research and development for distributed computing to accelerate innovation in the public and private sectors. To host edge computing powered by local clean energy, we open up federal land and institutions. And finally, we streamline support for next-generation energy sources like advanced nuclear grids , so the future grid can match the volume of AI energy demand. Through this approach, we reduce permit delays and unleash the latent value in our nation’s underused assets, from rural substations to decommissioned industrial zones. Our energy crisis cannot be solved with a single fix. But taken together, these steps serve as a resilient model for America to lead in AI development. This shift does much more than fix our energy bottleneck—it reshapes access. Developers can build independently of Big Tech without begging for compute. These infrastructure policies would level the field for smaller players to build and deploy advanced AI models, decentralizing opportunity itself. AI is set to shape every society and sector it touches. But ultimately, whoever controls the foundation will determine which values guide that outcome. We can let foreign powers consolidate that foundation, outstripping our capacities to build and entrenching centralization, surveillance, and control. Or we can leverage America’s edge and develop our infrastructure at the pace with which energy demands to guarantee resilience, transparency and freedom. If the U.S. wants to lead in AI, we must act decisively. We cannot rely on legacy systems or lethargic bureaucracy. We don’t need more studies or more panels. If we want to define the future on our terms, we need to build, and we need to build now.

The increase upped May’s 2.4% annual rate, buoyed by shelter, food, energy, and household goods gains. According to data released by the US Bureau of Labour Statistics (BLS), on a monthly basis, the CPI rose 0.3%, the biggest percentage uptick since January. Core inflation, which strips out food and energy costs, increased by 2.9% over the past 12 months. The figure came in slightly below the 3% predicted by analysts but is well above the Federal Reserve’s long-term target of 2%. Shelter and core goods trending upwards The BLS reported that shelter is the single largest contributor to overall inflation, despite slowing down to a 0.2% rise for the month. The category was up 3.8% year-over-year, with rent-equivalent measurements for owner-occupied housing up 0.3%. Lodging away from home, however, dropped by 2.9%. In other categories, food prices rose 0.3% in June and were up 3% over the past 12 months. Energy prices, which declined in May, rebounded with a 0.9% monthly increase, although they are slightly lower compared to June 2024. Transportation services ticked higher by 0.2%, while medical care services posted a 0.6% increase. Vehicle prices moved in the opposite direction, as prices for new cars declined 0.3%, and used car and truck prices fell by 0.7%. Trade-sensitive categories like apparel prices, affected by tariffs, rose 0.4%, while household furnishings increased 1%, one of the largest jumps among core goods. Trump administration is confident of the US economic situation Speaking at the White House on Monday, ahead of the CPI release, President Donald Trump said that inflation was no longer a concern. “The economy is roaring, business confidence is soaring, incomes are up, prices are down, and inflation is dead,” he told reporters at the press briefing. Yet, economists believe that even though inflation is objectively “steady,” the tariff situation around America and its trading partners will shoot up rates. According to the Yale Budget Lab, the US currently imposes an average tariff rate of 18.7%, the highest since 1933. The levies include 30% tariffs on Chinese imports, 50% on steel and aluminum, and 25% on auto parts. A flat 10% tariff also applies to all other imports. These do not yet include recently announced threats by Trump, who over the weekend threatened to slap nations with new tariff rates. Under the new threats , the European Union and Mexico would face 30% tariffs, Canada would be hit with a 35% levy, and Brazil could see tariffs as high as 50%. The move against Brazil is reportedly a response to the ongoing trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro, a close Trump ally, who is facing charges linked to an attempted coup. George Goncalves, head of US macro strategy at MUFG, told Bloomberg that while CPI readings were firmer, they were unlikely to surprise markets given the anticipated 0.3% increase. “ The worst-case scenario is that CPI categories potentially impacted by tariffs finally see a notable push up, ” Goncalves remarked. Despite the stronger CPI report, financial markets continued to bet that the Federal Reserve may begin cutting short-term interest rates by September. Traders currently see a 5% probability of a rate cut in July, but are more confident in their expectations for a policy change later in the year.

Roxom will debut the new exchange in September with a waitlist now open for early access, according to an emailed announcement shared with CoinDesk on Tuesday. The San Francisco-based project said the exchange will ""reflect the Bitcoin white paper's original vision of a global, permissionless store of value."" The bitcoin treasuries exchange will allow BTC-denominated buying and selling of shares in companies with significant bitcoin holdings, such as Strategy (MSTR) and Metaplanet (3350). Following the lead of these two companies, there has been a glut of publicly-listed firms building bitcoin treasuries in recent months. Just last week, three such companies raised a combined $278 million toward the goal of boosting their BTC holdings . Roxom's aim is to provide exposure to bitcoin using BTC treasury companies as a proxy, without the need to convert bitcoin or navigate brokerages. The project raised $17.9 million in funding from Draper Associates, Borderless Capital, ego death and Kingsway Capital earlier this year, with which it began building a bitcoin treasury of its own. Roxom held 84.72 BTC ($9.9 million) as of May and has plans to acquire a further 30, which would take its treasury value to nearly $13.5 million. Alongside its securities exchange, Roxom is also building a 24/7 media network dedicated entirely to bitcoin.

Venga, an all-in-one cryptocurrency platform, has announced that its mobile application is available in Catalan and Spanish. The app has incorporated an intuitive interface, robust security, a compliance-focused approach, and a strong educational focus. The app will operate natively in Catalan. Venga was registered by the Bank of Spain and Poland’s Ministry of Finance as a licensed Virtual Asset Service Provider. The platform submitted a pre-application for a MiCA license earlier this year. MiCA, which came into effect on December 31, 2024, introduced a regulatory framework for the crypto sector in the EU. Venga’s CEO, Michael Stroev, reiterated that they have had a compliance-first approach from day one. Venga empowers over 10 million Catalans with a localized Web3 app The Venga mobile app allows EU citizens to access decentralised finance (DeFi) features, crypto trading, and stacking. The application has an intuitive user experience that allows beginners to enter the Web3 and blockchain ecosystem easily. With the integration of the Catalan and Spanish languages, the app gives users tailored services such as named IBANs, crypto exchange, and earning products. “ Since I moved to Barcelona in 2020, it has been my dream to build a startup that truly feels local and has a product and service tailored to Catalan and Spanish speakers and communities. Having the languages available in our app is the beginning of our broader objective to create a hyper-localized Venga experience for Barcelona, Catalunya, and all of Spain.” Michael Stroev, CEO of Venga The crypto app incorporating Catalan and Spanish languages has been influenced by the team members, including its CTO Raul Arribas, and almost a third of its team comprises Catalans. Roughly ten million people speak Catalan, forming the first language for citizens across Catalonia. Venga identified that nearly 20% of the Catalan population uses crypto but lacks the services in their native language. The Catalan language also spans the Valencia region, Andorra, the Balearic Islands, Eastern Aragon, Roussillon (southern France), and parts of Sardinia (Italy). Raul Arribas, CTO of Venga, revealed his delight at providing a crypto app in his language, allowing them to navigate the crypto ecosystem in the same language as his childhood. He added that the offering in the Catalan language supports Spain’s leading languages, empowering users to explore their native language confidently. Catalan and Spanish integration positions Venga as a leader in inclusive DeFi Venga was created to address the challenges experienced during onboarding to the on-chain economy. It cited how banks and other payment providers treated crypto-curious customers with suspicion, raising their risk profile and screening them from accessing essential financial services. Venga highlighted its approach to crypto users as clients and not as threats, granting them the level of customer care they are entitled to. Venga’s approach to its customers as valued clients inspired confidence in customers and the knowledge that they would get all the support and information required at every step of the onboarding process. It revealed that the integration into the Catalan and Spanish languages has paved the way for collaborations with local companies and organizations seeking to advance crypto education and expand access to blockchain services.

Recently, the Euro Yen Exchange Rate has captured significant attention, hitting a remarkable one-year high. This powerful surge isn’t just a fleeting market anomaly; it’s a profound reflection of deeper shifts in global finance, particularly stemming from growing concerns surrounding the upcoming Japan Election . For anyone tracking global markets, especially those with an interest in how macro-economic shifts influence asset prices, understanding this move is crucial. Let’s delve into the forces driving this dramatic ascent and what it means for the future of these major currencies. Understanding the Euro Yen Exchange Rate Phenomenon The Euro Yen (EUR/JPY) currency pair represents the exchange rate between the Euro (EUR), the currency of the Eurozone, and the Japanese Yen (JPY), the currency of Japan. As a ‘cross currency’ pair, it doesn’t involve the US Dollar directly, but its movements are still deeply intertwined with broader Global Forex Trends . The recent spike in EUR/JPY signifies a notable strengthening of the Euro against the Yen, reaching levels not seen in a year. This isn’t merely a numerical change; it reflects fundamental divergences in economic outlooks and monetary policies between the Eurozone and Japan. What Drives the Euro Yen Pair? Several key factors typically influence the EUR/JPY exchange rate: Interest Rate Differentials: This is arguably the most significant driver. When one central bank raises rates while another keeps them low, investors tend to move capital to the higher-yielding currency, creating demand for it. Economic Performance: Strong economic growth, low unemployment, and robust trade surpluses in one region can bolster its currency. Monetary Policy Divergence: Different approaches by central banks (e.g., quantitative easing vs. tightening) directly impact currency valuations. Geopolitical Events: Wars, political instability, or major international agreements can trigger significant currency movements as investors seek safe havens or react to new risks. The current EUR/JPY surge is a textbook example of how a combination of these factors can create a powerful trend. The Eurozone, despite its own challenges, has seen its central bank embark on a tightening cycle, while Japan has steadfastly maintained its ultra-loose monetary policy. Why is Japanese Yen Weakness a Key Driver? The most prominent factor behind the Euro’s rise against the Yen is the persistent and pronounced Japanese Yen Weakness . This weakness is not accidental; it is a direct consequence of the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) long-standing commitment to ultra-loose monetary policy, often referred to as ‘Abenomics’ and its continuation under successive leadership. While global central banks, including the European Central Bank (ECB) and the U.S. Federal Reserve, have aggressively raised interest rates to combat soaring inflation, the BOJ has remained an outlier. The Bank of Japan’s Dovish Stance The BOJ has maintained its Yield Curve Control (YCC) policy, which pegs the yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds (JGBs) around zero percent, and has kept short-term interest rates in negative territory. The rationale behind this is to stimulate a sluggish economy and finally achieve a sustained 2% inflation target, which Japan has struggled with for decades. However, this dovish stance creates a significant interest rate differential with other major economies. When the Eurozone’s interest rates are rising, making Euro-denominated assets more attractive for yield-seeking investors, capital naturally flows out of Japan and into the Eurozone. This increased demand for Euros and reduced demand for Yen directly contributes to the EUR/JPY’s upward trajectory. Economic Disparities and Inflationary Pressures Furthermore, Japan’s economic landscape differs significantly from the Eurozone’s. While the Eurozone grapples with high inflation rates driven by energy costs and supply chain disruptions, Japan’s inflation, though rising, has been less persistent and often attributed to import costs rather than robust domestic demand. This disparity in inflationary pressures reinforces the BOJ’s cautious approach, contrasting sharply with the ECB’s hawkish stance. The perceived lack of urgency from the BOJ to normalize policy, despite the weakening Yen pushing up import costs, signals to the market that the interest rate gap will likely persist, further fueling Japanese Yen Weakness . The Crucial Role of Political Uncertainty Japan Beyond monetary policy, the impending Japan Election adds another layer of complexity and uncertainty to the Yen’s outlook. While the specific details of the election (e.g., whether it’s a snap election or a scheduled one) might vary, the mere prospect of political shifts can significantly impact investor confidence and currency valuations. Markets generally dislike uncertainty, and elections often bring with them the potential for changes in leadership, economic policy, and even the direction of monetary policy. Election Dynamics and Market Speculation Investors are keenly watching for any signals regarding the future direction of Japan’s economic policies. Will a new government or a reconfigured ruling coalition push for different fiscal policies? Could there be pressure on the Bank of Japan to reconsider its ultra-loose stance, or conversely, to double down on stimulus? Speculation surrounding these possibilities can lead to increased volatility in the Yen. If the market perceives that the outcome of the election could lead to even greater fiscal spending without a corresponding shift in monetary policy, it could exacerbate the Yen’s depreciation due to concerns about Japan’s already massive public debt. Potential Policy Shifts and Their Currency Implications A change in government could, for example, lead to a review of the BOJ’s mandate or leadership, even if indirect. While the BOJ maintains its independence, political pressure can subtly influence policy discussions. Any hint of a more hawkish stance post-election, or a significant change in the government’s economic growth strategy, could trigger a sharp reversal in the Yen’s fortunes. Conversely, if the election outcome reinforces the status quo of loose fiscal and monetary policies, it would likely perpetuate the Japanese Yen Weakness , continuing to support the Euro Yen’s upward trend. This political dimension is a critical component of the current market narrative surrounding the Yen. Navigating Global Forex Trends: A Broader Perspective While the Euro Yen pair’s recent movements are heavily influenced by specific factors related to Europe and Japan, it’s essential to view them within the wider context of Global Forex Trends . Currency markets are interconnected, and a shift in one major pair can have ripple effects across others. The strength of the US Dollar, for instance, often plays a pivotal role in determining the overall sentiment in the forex market. When the Dollar strengthens, it can put pressure on other currencies, including the Euro, and vice-versa. Interplay with the US Dollar and Other Majors The US Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate hikes have made the Dollar a very attractive currency for carry trades and safe-haven flows. This can indirectly influence EUR/JPY. For example, if the Dollar weakens, some capital might flow out of USD and seek opportunities in other strong currencies like the Euro, potentially reinforcing the Euro’s strength against the Yen. Conversely, a stronger Dollar might divert some capital from the Euro, potentially capping the EUR/JPY’s ascent. Furthermore, geopolitical events, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine or energy supply concerns in Europe, also contribute to the broader risk sentiment that influences all major currency pairs, including the Euro Yen. Implications for Carry Trades The substantial interest rate differential between the Eurozone and Japan has made the EUR/JPY pair particularly attractive for ‘carry trades’. In a carry trade, investors borrow in a low-interest-rate currency (like the Yen) and invest in a higher-interest-rate currency (like the Euro). The profit comes from the interest rate differential. The wider this differential, the more attractive the carry trade becomes, driving demand for the higher-yielding currency and increasing the supply of the lower-yielding one. This mechanism is a significant underlying force contributing to the current Global Forex Trends favoring the Euro against the Yen. Currency Market Dynamics: Opportunities and Challenges The current environment of pronounced Currency Market Dynamics in the Euro Yen pair presents both significant opportunities and notable challenges for traders and investors. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for making informed decisions in a volatile market. Trading Strategies for the Euro Yen Pair For traders, the clear trend in EUR/JPY offers potential for various strategies. Trend-following strategies, where traders aim to capitalize on the sustained upward movement, could be profitable. This involves identifying key support levels and riding the momentum. Breakout strategies, which look for the price to move beyond established resistance levels, could also be employed as the pair hits new highs. Furthermore, given the interest rate differential, long positions (buying Euro, selling Yen) benefit from the positive carry, meaning traders earn interest on their position overnight, which can add to overall returns. Risk Management in Volatile Markets However, no market move is without risk. While the trend for EUR/JPY has been strong, currency markets are inherently volatile and can reverse quickly on unexpected news. Political surprises from Japan, a sudden hawkish shift from the Bank of Japan, or an unexpected economic downturn in the Eurozone could all trigger sharp pullbacks. Therefore, robust risk management is paramount. This includes setting appropriate stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, managing position sizes relative to one’s capital, and continuously monitoring economic data releases and central bank communications. Traders must also be aware of potential ‘flash crashes’ or liquidity issues, especially during periods of low trading volume or major news events, which can lead to rapid and unpredictable price movements. Long-Term Outlook for the Euro Yen Looking ahead, the long-term trajectory of the Euro Yen will largely depend on the sustained divergence in monetary policies between the ECB and the BOJ, as well as the resolution of Political Uncertainty Japan . If the BOJ maintains its dovish stance while the ECB continues to tighten, the EUR/JPY could see further gains. However, any shift in the BOJ’s policy, perhaps under new leadership or in response to rising inflation pressures in Japan, could lead to a significant correction. Investors should closely watch for changes in rhetoric from both central banks and the outcomes of political events to anticipate future shifts in these complex Currency Market Dynamics . Conclusion: What Lies Ahead for the Euro Yen? The dramatic surge of the Euro Yen Exchange Rate to a one-year high is a powerful testament to the intricate forces shaping global finance. It’s a story driven by the stark divergence in monetary policies between the Eurozone and Japan, where the European Central Bank’s hawkish stance contrasts sharply with the Bank of Japan’s steadfast commitment to ultra-loose measures. This fundamental difference in interest rate trajectories has made the Yen an attractive funding currency for carry trades, fueling demand for the Euro. Furthermore, the layer of Political Uncertainty Japan , particularly surrounding the upcoming election, adds an element of speculation and caution, influencing investor sentiment and contributing to the Yen’s continued weakness. As we navigate these complex Global Forex Trends , it’s clear that the interplay of economic fundamentals, central bank actions, and geopolitical factors will continue to dictate the path of the EUR/JPY. For market participants, understanding these underlying drivers and the broader Currency Market Dynamics is not just an academic exercise but a necessity for informed decision-making. While the current trend favors the Euro, the ever-present potential for policy shifts or unexpected events means vigilance and robust risk management remain paramount. The Euro Yen saga is far from over, promising continued fascination and opportunity for those willing to delve into its depths.

Santiment lists the reasons behind this online presence increase and one of them, expectedly, is related to the price pump that drove the asset to just over $3: “XRP has experienced significant price surges nearing all-time highs, with analysts forecasting potential rallies amid favorable market conditions and regulatory developments. Investors are closely watching XRP’s market behavior and its relationship with Bitcoin, reflecting both optimism and skepticism about its place in crypto portfolios,” – reads the post . Recall that Ripple’s cross-border token was confined in a tight range between $2.2 and $2.3 for weeks before the breakout that began last week. At the time, the token soared past the upper boundary and kept climbing to the first major resistance at $2.6. It fell without much of a fight, and XRP continued its ascent in the following days. The culmination, for now at least, took place yesterday when the token surged to a four-month peak of just over $3. Thus, XRP came around 12-3% away from its all-time high registered in January 2018 and matched in January 2025. This led to enhanced predictions from analysts that XRP is “screaming new all-time highs,” as reported. Nevertheless, the asset retraced slightly in the following hours, alongside the rest of the market, and now sits below that coveted resistance. According to Santiment, though, there are other, more profound reasons behind the growing online discussions about Ripple and its native cryptocurrency: “XRP is trending due to extensive discussions about its role and future in the cryptocurrency market, including Ripple’s launch of RLUSD on the XRPL, debates on its value and long-term potential, and comparisons with other major cryptocurrencies.” The company behind it has notched several big partnerships and acquisitions in the past few years, including the purchase of Hidden Road for over $1.2 billion announced in April 2025. RLUSD has gained traction in terms of market cap as the stablecoin, which is built for enterprise utility instead of retail engagement, recently exceeded $500 million.

According to Schwartz, Ripple’s focus has moved away from traditional banking institutions. The reason? Banks are simply too slow, too conservative, and ultimately not the future of XRP’s success. Moving Beyond the Banks Reflecting on Ripple’s early strategy, Schwartz explained that banks once seemed like ideal partners because of the prestige and media attention they brought. “Banks, it’s very sexy when you close a deal with a bank,” he said. But despite the publicity, those partnerships rarely led to meaningful utility. “They are never going to be Ripple success stories,” he added, describing banks as overly cautious and unwilling to take the kind of risks that blockchain technology demands. According to Schwartz, banks hesitate to pass on the benefits of Ripple’s innovations to their customers, fearing it may highlight their inefficiencies. This reluctance has led Ripple to rethink its priorities. Deals that once served as headline-grabbing milestones now feel hollow if they don’t result in real usage. “If all they want is a press release… now we’re like, hey, we want to move billions of dollars now,” he emphasized. BREAKING: Ripple CTO shakes the industry — “ #XRP no longer needs banks.” The game has changed. Decentralized liquidity is here. Is this the dawn of a new financial order? pic.twitter.com/qWKI8qLIeC — XRP Governor (@xrpgovernor) July 15, 2025 From Press Releases to Real Volume This shift in mindset marks a significant evolution for Ripple. The company is no longer interested in symbolic partnerships. Instead, it’s focused on generating real transaction volume and enabling faster, cheaper, and more reliable cross-border payments. While banks were once seen as the gateway to institutional adoption, their reluctance to embrace innovation has left the door wide open for more agile players. Fintechs, money service businesses, and crypto-native platforms are stepping in to fill the gap, driving real-world adoption of XRP through Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service and other decentralized tools. The Rise of Decentralized Liquidity Schwartz’s comments carry an even deeper implication: XRP no longer needs banks to thrive. With the rise of decentralized finance and tokenized real-world assets, XRP is finding new momentum outside of the traditional financial system. Ripple has already processed billions in transactions without relying on legacy banking rails. Instead, decentralized liquidity pools, crypto exchanges, and stablecoins are enabling a new era of financial freedom.

It’s a future where utility, not reputation, drives adoption, and where XRP operates as the backbone of a more open, efficient financial network. A Turning Point for Ripple and XRP The message from Ripple’s CTO is clear: the game has changed. Banks may still have a role, but they’re no longer at the center of Ripple’s strategy. XRP is moving forward with or without them, powered by decentralized infrastructure and real-world use cases. As shared by XRP Governor, Schwartz’s remarks signal a pivotal turning point, not just for Ripple, but for the global financial system. The age of decentralized liquidity has arrived, and XRP is ready to lead the charge. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to his post, XRP has broken out of a falling wedge pattern on the daily chart relative to Bitcoin. He accompanied his analysis with a chart showing the XRP/BTC pair on Binance, plotted on a daily timeframe, where price action can be seen breaking above the upper trendline of a downward-sloping wedge. At the time of his post, the ratio stood at approximately 0.00002393 BTC, with a daily gain of about 2.92 percent. In his brief commentary, Crypto Michael questioned the bearish sentiment still surrounding XRP despite the technical development. He wrote: “XRP just broke out of a falling wedge against Bitcoin on the daily chart, and you’re still bearish? Higher.” His statement suggests he views the breakout as a bullish signal and expects the XRP/BTC ratio to move higher from here. The falling wedge pattern is often interpreted by technical traders as a potential reversal or continuation pattern, depending on the context. XRP just broke out of a falling wedge against Bitcoin on the daily chart, and you’re still bearish? Higher. pic.twitter.com/HAersdSz9h — Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT) July 12, 2025 Community Reactions Emphasize Key Levels and Volume Other crypto community members also weighed in on the analysis in the comments under Michael’s post. Gevcrypto Official provided additional perspective on potential price levels to watch, writing : “i think….if xrp breaks through $2.90….the price will quickly reach $3….this is a key level…..above it the impulse will start….if it doesn’t break through….a pullback to $2.70 is possible…” This comment highlights the importance of $2.90 level as a resistance point, beyond which a larger upward move could materialize. The mention of a possible pullback to $2.70 reflects a cautious view that acknowledges the risk of a short-term reversal if $2.90 cannot be surpassed. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another user, Wind Blows Tenderness, pointed out the role of trading volume in confirming the breakout, stating : “If volume picks up this can increase the validity of the breakout.” This reflects a common principle in technical analysis where a breakout accompanied by strong volume is generally considered more reliable than one occurring on light volume. Implications of the Breakout The breakout highlighted by Crypto Michael appears to have strengthened bullish sentiment around XRP, at least in the context of its performance relative to Bitcoin . The chart he shared shows a multi-month wedge formation that started earlier in 2025, culminating in the recent move above the resistance trendline. With the XRP/BTC ratio now moving higher, traders are watching closely to see if momentum can build and whether key price levels on the USD pair, such as $2.90 and $3.00, can also be tested in the near term. The observation regarding trading volume remains important, as confirmation of a breakout typically depends on stronger participation by market participants. Overall, the analysis by Crypto Michael, as well as the supporting commentary from other users, reflects cautious optimism about XRP’s technical outlook in both its Bitcoin and dollar valuations.

The token public sale price? Just $0.004. That set its fully diluted valuation (FDV) at roughly $4 billion, but within hours, pre-market hype pushed that number closer to $5.5 billion. Some traders are already betting on a quick double. But beyond the flashy debut, the cracks are already showing. Let’s not kid ourselves— Pump Fun is built on the back of memecoin mania. That trend peaked months ago. Since then, we’ve seen the cycle too many times: a new token launches, the hype kicks in, prices pop, then collapse. What follows? Exit liquidity and a Telegram graveyard. Pump Fun leans heavily on the idea of “community-generated memecoins.” It’s catchy, sure. But is there substance behind it? That’s harder to see. There’s no clear product. No real revenue model. No defensible moat. Just vibes. At current market cap and FDV, $PUMP revenue returned to token holders (25%) is higher than $HYPE , $AAVE , and $RAY buybacks as a % of supply. The token also trades at the lowest multiples based on both total revenues and revenues to token holders. $5.5bn is fud. pic.twitter.com/fhKVzzXrXD — DMD (@Daveeemor) July 14, 2025 Still, the tokenomics are bold. According to CoinMarketCap, Pump Fun sits at a $1.9 billion market cap and a $5.5 billion FDV. Twenty-five percent of all platform revenue is earmarked for holders. On paper, that’s better than the likes of $HYPE (18%), $AAVE (15%), and $RAY (20%) in terms of buyback efficiency. Combine that with low revenue multiples, and you could argue Pump Fun is undervalued. But in practice, that argument only works if everything goes perfectly. And right now, the setup is shaky. Bybit funding rates are running hot. Longs are deep underwater after the listing. Shorts have already exited. That leaves long positions hanging by a thread, especially if price dips trigger liquidations. $PUMP Airdrop Coming? Then there’s the elephant in the room: the airdrop. A large chunk of tokens hasn’t been distributed yet. Once they hit wallets, we could see a massive wave of selling. Until those two issues clear, the price is likely stuck in a narrow, choppy range. There’s still a shot this plays out well. If the airdrop goes smoothly, and funding pressure eases, the token might rerate higher. In that case, traders could come running—especially those watching revenue metrics and looking for value plays in high-FDV tokens. The bigger question is whether the ecosystem fund—set at 24% of the token supply—can spark a real creator economy. Can Pump Fun attract developers and meme creators who stick around after the hype fades? Or will it be another flash-in-the-pan token that dies the moment attention shifts elsewhere? The signals are mixed. Daily trading volumes are strong. Social sentiment on Telegram and X is intense. But fundamentals are still flimsy. There’s no revenue beyond token fees. No clear roadmap. And no evidence this can survive beyond the memecoin cycle. If we do get a turnaround, it will come fast. Once funding normalizes and the airdrop pressure clears, momentum could return quickly. But traders need to stay sharp. Watch Bybit’s funding rates. Track wallet activity on-chain. Pay attention to X threads and Telegram chatter. And above all, don’t chase green candles blindly.

In just a few weeks, this lending protocol has secured over $12.2 million in its Phase 5 presale, with 73% of the supply already sold at the $0.03 price mark. With only 27% of Phase 5 tokens left, the price is about to jump 20% to $0.035, and later list at $0.06, putting early buyers on track for immediate 2x upside and long-term 10x returns. The rush is justified. Unlike many hyped-up tokens without working use cases, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a real Layer-2 ecosystem that blends high-yield DeFi with scalable infrastructure. From seamless gas-free lending to its dual-model system—peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P)—Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gearing up to reshape how users borrow and lend across digital assets. A Scalable DeFi Model With Built-In Yield Generation What will make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) especially compelling will be its stablecoin foundation. This decentralized asset will be minted only when users borrow against overcollateralized crypto like ETH or AVAX. When the loan is repaid or liquidated, the stablecoin will be automatically burned, ensuring the supply remains tightly in sync with real borrowing activity. To keep its price pegged at $1, the system will rely on governance-controlled interest rates and arbitrage incentives, maintaining long-term price stability without external dependency. Each minting action will also support broader protocol utility. As users interact with the stablecoin system, transaction fees will feed into Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s treasury — enabling MUTM token buybacks and staking rewards for users who lock mtTokens. The more stablecoins are used, the stronger and more self-sustaining the ecosystem will become. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will stand apart by offering users access to two powerful DeFi lending frameworks. In the P2C model, users will supply liquidity to pooled smart contracts and will receive passive income based on dynamic APY levels—adjusted automatically by pool utilization and market demand. In the P2P model, users will define their own lending agreements with customized rates and collateral types. These models will operate side-by-side, providing flexibility for both conservative and risk-tolerant investors. This entire ecosystem will be deployed on Layer-2 infrastructure, dramatically reducing gas fees while increasing transaction speed and finality. The protocol’s roadmap will include upcoming beta testing, real-time collateral tracking, and smart contract automation—all of which will help accelerate its total value locked (TVL) once launched live. Compounding Passive Income With mtTokens and Protocol Dividends When users supply assets into Mutuum Finance (MUTM), they receive mtTokens, such as mtUSDT or mtETH in 1:1, which represent both the initial deposit and accrued yield. These mtTokens automatically grow in value over time and can be staked into dividend based smart contracts. The result is a compounding yield structure—users earn regular lending interest, and on top of that, dividends funded by real protocol revenue. The entire mechanism is engineered to reward participation. As the stablecoin system grows and more loans are minted or repaid, the dividend pool expands. mtToken holders are at the core of this structure, creating long-term alignment with the success of the platform. An investor who rotated $4,000 from SOL into MUTM during Phase 2 at $0.015 is now holding a position worth over $8,000 at today’s $0.03 price. With the listing scheduled at $0.06, the same holder is preparing for a 6x upside by launch and projections of 10x to 15x by 2026 as user activity, and Layer-2 adoption scale upward. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already drawn significant confidence from the crypto community. Its code has undergone full auditing by CertiK, with a Token Scan score of 95.00 and Skynet score of 77.5, placing it well above the average DeFi project in terms of technical readiness and transparency. A $50,000 bug bounty is currently running in partnership with CertiK, and an ongoing $100,000 giveaway is driving further traction. On social platforms, the project has crossed 12,000 followers on X (Twitter), further validating its early momentum. This is not the time to hesitate. Phase 5 is nearly sold out, and once it closes, the token price permanently jumps to $0.035. For those seeking exposure before the next breakout, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) remains one of the few credible plays still available at ground-floor pricing. Lock in at $0.03 today—or watch the market leave you behind.

Priced at $0.35 per token, the initial allocation was completed rapidly. The team sees this outcome as reflecting the level of interest in tokenized products that incorporate elements of asset backing and operational infrastructure. Due to additional requests, MultiBank Group will conduct a second and final $MBG Token Pre-Sale on Friday, July 18, ahead of the scheduled Token Generation Event (TGE) on July 22. This round will offer 3 million tokens at $0.35 and will be accessible through MultiBank.io and Uniswap. Commenting on the success of the Pre-Sale, Naser Taher, Founder and Chairman of MultiBank Group, said: “The sell-out of our initial $MBG Token offering in less than one hour is a decisive validation of our vision. In a market saturated with speculation, the response we received confirms that institutional-grade transparency, regulatory integrity, and asset-backed value are what investors are now demanding. $MBG is here for the long term, reflecting the experience, resources, and global reach that underpin everything we do at MultiBank Group. The market has spoken, and it has spoken with speed and conviction.” According to MultiBank Group, the $MBG token is supported by $29 billion in assets and linked to a broader operational framework that records $35 billion in daily turnover. The ecosystem supporting $MBG is anchored by its four pillars: MultiBank TradFi: Reported $362 million in revenue in 2024 through global CFD trading operations. MEX Exchange: An institutional-grade marketplace with a planned launch later in the year, projected at $23.7 billion. MultiBank.io RWA: A platform focused on the tokenization of real-world assets, including $3 billion in ultra-luxury real estate. MultiBank.io: Extending into crypto derivatives alongside the token initiative.

According to the report, the network is set to draw steady interest from stablecoin investors as lawmakers in Washington take up crypto bills in Congress. Ethereum’s role as the home for over 50% of all dollar‑pegged coins has caught the eyes of big banks and asset managers alike. Related Reading: XRP To Hit $4 This Week? This Crypto Expert Thinks So Stablecoin Legislation Under The Lens Based on reports, this week’s Crypto Week in the US House of Representatives could reshape the stablecoin sector. Lawmakers are debating three major bills: the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, and the Anti‑CBDC Surveillance bill. House Financial Services Chair French Hill told a “Think Crypto” podcast that dollar‑backed coins would solidify the US dollar’s global lead. If Congress backs clear rules, the rails that already carry the most volumes could see fresh inflows. BofA launches new weekly periodical ‘On Chain,’ designed to “drill into the various facets of the fast-evolving digital assets ecosystem.” First call: Bullish ETH pic.twitter.com/sERRZiTgMq — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) July 14, 2025 Rails For The Future Bank of America called out infrastructure providers like Stripe and the Ethereum network as prime plays for anyone looking to get stablecoin exposure. That nod isn’t just for the token itself. It’s a bet on the whole stack—wallets, apps and payment tools that ride on Ethereum’s code. Investors who pick up Ether now could tap growing on‑chain activity as stablecoin use climbs. Institutions Bet On Ether The report also mentioned Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent predicting that the dollar‑pegged stablecoin market may swell to $2 trillion in the next five years. That forecast has fund managers circling the charts. Thomas Lee, Fundstart CIO and new chairman of BitMine, even dubbed stablecoins the “ChatGPT of crypto.” His firm now holds Ether in its treasury. The move shows how big players are gearing up for a stablecoin surge on Ethereum. Related Reading: Avalanche Shatters Record With 20M Transactions—Is Real-World Use Finally Here? Other sectors are racing alongside stablecoins. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said tokenization could expand 4,000 times over time. He sees on‑chain assets tied to real‑world items booming soon. Some say XRP and Ether are the go‑to tokens for that play. But Ethereum already has the advantage of scale. It isn’t all smooth sailing. Regulation could tighten or split along different chains. New networks chase faster speeds and lower fees. That competition could chip away at Ethereum’s lead. Still, the network’s mix of smart‑contract tools and high stablecoin volumes gives it a strong head start. For now, plenty of eyes are on Congress and on‑chain data. If US lawmakers set clear stablecoin rules, Ethereum may keep its crown as the top hub. Investors looking for exposure will likely track Ether flows and watch the bills as they move through committee. The weeks ahead could spell out the next big chapter for the network.

The firm raised $413 million via the issuance of over 24 million shares between July 7 and July 11, according to a press release . It purchased a total of 74,656 ETH over the past week at an average price of $2,852 each. Roughly $257 million of that fundraising remained for future ETH acquisitions, the firm said. SBET shares were trading 5% higher in U.S. action on Tuesday even as ETH slipped modestly to $2,990. The stock has risen roughly six-fold since the ETH treasury pivot several weeks ago. With the latest purchase, the firm said it has now surpassed the Ethereum Foundation, the development organization behind the blockchain, to become the largest corporate owner of ETH. Notably, the foundation recently sold 10,000 ETH to SharpLink Gaming in an OTC deal. The Ethereum Foundation holds $665 million in ETH, according to blockchain data by Arkham Intelligence. Sharplink Gaming is one of the public companies that have recently pivoted to a crypto treasury strategy, following the bitcoin-focused BTC playbook of Michael Saylor's Strategy. Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin joined the firm as chairman. The firm uses capital markets to raise funds to acquire ETH, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, while operating validators and staking the tokens to earn a reward. The company said it has earned 415 ETH, roughly $1.2 million at current prices, through staking since its treasury pivot in June. Other U.S.-listed firms such as Tom Lee's Bitmine Immersion Technology (BMNR) and bitcoin miner BIT Digital (BTBT) also turned into an ETH treasury play.

Priced at $0.35 per token, the initial allocation was completed rapidly. The team sees this outcome as reflecting the level of interest in tokenized products that incorporate elements of asset backing and operational infrastructure. Due to additional requests, MultiBank Group will conduct a second and final MBG Token Pre-Sale on Friday, July 18, ahead of the scheduled Token Generation Event (TGE) on July 22. This round will offer 3 million tokens at $0.35 and will be accessible through MultiBank.io and Uniswap. Commenting on the success of the Pre-Sale, Naser Taher, Founder and Chairman of MultiBank Group, said: “The sell-out of our initial MBG Token offering in less than one hour is a decisive validation of our vision. In a market saturated with speculation, the response we received confirms that institutional-grade transparency, regulatory integrity, and asset-backed value are what investors are now demanding. MBG is here for the long term, reflecting the experience, resources, and global reach that underpin everything we do at MultiBank Group. The market has spoken, and it has spoken with speed and conviction.” According to MultiBank Group, the MBG token is supported by $29 billion in assets and linked to a broader operational framework that records $35 billion in daily turnover.

The hackers targeted one of the platform’s key features, the rebalancer on the Base network. Shortly after the exploit , the Arcadia team took to X, formerly Twitter, to warn users, urging them to remove the permissions for their asset managers and remove active rebalancers to prevent further losses. Source: PeckShield More about the hack According to blockchain security firm PeckShield, Arcadia Finance lost about 840 Ethereum tokens, worth roughly $2.5 million at current prices. PeckShield wrote in an X post that the hackers have already bridged the stolen assets from Base to Ethereum, and the sanctioned crypto mixer, Tornado Cash, reportedly played a part. While the value of ETH lost to the hackers is considerable, it is not the first time Arcadia has experienced such an occurrence. The liquidity management platform witnessed a $455,000 hack in July 2023 when hackers exploited a vulnerability in its code. Arcadia Finance is backed by Coinbase Ventures and is also part of the Circle Alliance, which it joined in late June. According to its website, USDC makes up more than a third of Arcadia’s TVL. Arcadia’s contracts have now been paused with no clear timeline for contract resumption. In the meantime, it reports that it is collaborating with security analysts in a bid to ascertain how the breach occurred. Arcadia Finance said, “We will continue to work with our security partners, law enforcement, and the broader community to resolve this as best we can. Our number one priority is recovering funds for Arcadia protocol users.” As for how the community and market are reacting to the exploit, skepticism and concern have taken center stage, with many worried about the state of cross-chain security. Wave of hacks sweeps through crypto in 2025 Over $2.1 billion has been stolen across more than 75 hacking incidents so far this year, a figure that nearly accounts for the total losses recorded in 2024. This indicates a significant increase in attacks, and they differ in scale and sophistication compared to years 2024 and earlier. The amount the hackers got away with in the Arcadia exploit is small compared to the larger hacks that have happened this year; however, it calls attention to the vulnerabilities that plague the DeFi sector. One recurring problem is that smart contracts and cross-chain mechanisms, especially bridges, are still too susceptible to attacks, and criminals know it. According to reports, more than 80% of the stolen funds in 2025 happened in infrastructure-level breaches that saw the hackers get away with more funds than other exploit types, like smart contract vulnerabilities. The most notable hack this year has been the breach of the Bybit exchange that occurred in February, where hackers made away with $1.5 billion. The attack, attributed to North Korea-linked Lazarus Group pushed the average hack size to double what it was in 2024. Other notable incidents have included the $225.6 million Cetus protocol exploit and the $89.1 million hack of the Nobitex exchange in Iran, actions linked to the Israel-based group Gonjeshke Darande.

The process, which is already live, replaces Bitwise’s prior practice of publicly listing nearly 90 wallet addresses on its websites. Instead, The Network Firm will confirm on-chain holdings daily for the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) and Bitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW), reconciling balances with the number of fund shares outstanding, Bitwise said in a post on X. In the coming weeks, the firm said, it plans to add a second layer of transparency. That layer will bring in daily CPA-attested reports verifying not just asset balances but also fund liabilities. “Together, these features deliver a more comprehensive and easily readable approach to transparency,” the company wrote. The added layer is meant to assure investors that fund holdings match obligations. Proof-of-reserve audits have been a growing trend in the cryptocurrency industry, taking off after the collapse of FTX in November 2022. That collapse occurred after a leaked balance sheet triggered a bank run on the exchange, revealing it did not have customers’ assets on hand to meet its obligations. Since then, platforms’ reserves have been a major concern for investors. Bitwise’s bitcoin exchange-traded fund currently has $4.9 billion in net assets, far below the market leader, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which holds $85.9 billion, according to SoSoValue data.

At press time, PUMP was trading at $0.00570, down 15% over the past 24 hours, making it the largest loser among the 100 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The token initially surged to a peak of $0.00968 but has since dropped 41%. PUMP one-day price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Launched on July 12 through a public token sale , the PUMP ICO raised $500 million in just 12 minutes, selling 150 billion tokens at $0.004 each. While a broader market pullback, driven by Bitcoin ( BTC ) losing the $120,000 support level, has added to the sell-off, several PUMP-specific factors have accelerated the decline. For instance, on-chain data reveals that roughly 340 wallets controlled more than 60% of the presale allocation. Many of these wallets began selling their tokens as they unlocked on July 14, increasing selling pressure on the market. Volatility was further fueled by the decision from Binance and other major exchanges to list PUMP futures before spot markets, a move that appears to have dampened retail investor enthusiasm. Whales turn bearish on PUMP At the same time, large holders have shown a bearish stance. For instance, a whale reportedly opened a $8.5 million short position, while short funding rates on decentralized platforms spiked to an annualized rate of 1,100%, indicating extreme negative sentiment.

To this end, rival platform LetsBonk overtook Pump.fun in daily market share, grabbing 44.87% compared to Pump.fun’s 43.73%. LetsBonk also leads in token graduation rates, with 1.04% of its 18,150 tokens achieving full trading status versus 0.93% for Pump.fun’s 12,261 launches. Notably, Pump.fun, which gained popularity in 2024 as the go-to platform for launching Solana-based meme coins, had pitched the PUMP ICO as part of a larger vision to create a decentralized alternative to platforms like Facebook, TikTok, and Twitch. With the token now faltering, skepticism is growing over whether the project can fulfill its ambitious roadmap.

In a letter addressed to G20 finance ministers and central bank governors, newly appointed FSB Chair and Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, emphasized that assessing the growing role of stablecoins in payments and settlements is now a central concern for global financial stability. Bailey Warns Stablecoins May Undermine Financial Trust and Oversight Bailey, who began his term as chair in July, warned that the rapid expansion of stablecoins, digital assets typically pegged to fiat currencies, poses potential risks to monetary trust, credit creation, and financial oversight. “The potential risks and impacts [of stablecoins] are underexplored, in part due to the pace of market developments,” Bailey wrote. “We should continue to ensure that we are implementing our agreed recommendations, monitoring developments in this area, and collaborating across jurisdictions.” The renewed scrutiny follows the FSB’s earlier efforts to regulate stablecoins, starting with its 2021 global framework for monitoring their use. The watchdog has since warned of increased adoption in emerging markets, where stablecoins have become an accessible alternative to volatile local currencies and inefficient banking systems. In response to the spiraling adoption, the FSB said it will expand its work on understanding stablecoin-related risks in these economies. This week’s summit, hosted under South Africa’s G20 presidency, comes at a critical time. The global stablecoin market has settled more than $27.6 trillion in transactions during Q1 2025 alone , doubling Visa’s entire 2023 settlement volume. Stablecoins settle $27.6 trillion in Q1 2025, doubling Visa’s annual volume, as Ethereum’s infrastructure dominates global digital payments, even amid price turbulence. #Stablecoins #Ethereum https://t.co/LVFclqLGPX — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 18, 2025 In the U.S., lawmakers recently passed the GENIUS stablecoin bil l, marking a major step toward the formal integration of stablecoins into the mainstream financial system. However, Bailey has voiced concern about the systemic risks of this trend. In a recent interview with The Sunday Times, he argued against the idea of private banks issuing their own stablecoins , stating that such instruments could undermine traditional credit mechanisms and monetary policy control. BOE Governor Andrew Bailey has warned that big banks issuing private stablecoins would pose financial stability risks. #BankofEngland #AndrewBailey #Stablecoins https://t.co/9WpwUdkIAV — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 14, 2025 Instead of supporting stablecoins, Bailey has advocated for the digitization of bank deposits, calling it a safer and more regulated path that preserves central bank oversight. The FSB’s warnings also come against the backdrop of growing geopolitical and financial uncertainty. Bailey’s letter pointed to April’s market volatility as a reminder of the financial system’s vulnerabilities, especially outside traditional banking. He noted the importance of robust surveillance and regulatory coordination, particularly in light of the shift toward non-bank financial intermediation and the emergence of new technologies like stablecoins. Some of the key concerns raised include the potential for stablecoins to erode the “singleness of money,” a term used to describe the unified trust in currency across the economy. Bailey warned that if stablecoins begin circulating outside regulated systems, they could create parallel forms of money, complicating monetary policy and cross-border payments. Ethereum Breaks $3K as GENIUS Stablecoin Bill Nears House Vote—Market Bets on Regulatory Breakthrough Ethereum surged past the $3,000 mark on renewed optimism tied to U.S. legislative momentum around stablecoins, with its price climbing 2.13% in the past 24 hours to $3,028. The move caps off a strong weekly gain of 19%, coinciding with what some analysts say could be a turning point for Ethereum’s role in the global financial system. Bitcoin pumped hard after a bill was passed that aligned with the narrative. Today, the “GENIUS bill” voting is allegedly starting. Ethereum has become the backbone of the stablecoin ecosystem. Are you connecting the dots? pic.twitter.com/Y4xHNIDWas — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) July 15, 2025 The rally follows growing anticipation around the U.S. House of Representatives’ expected vote on the GENIUS Act , short for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins. The bill, which passed the Senate in June with bipartisan backing, seeks to create a formal regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. If passed, the GENIUS Act could offer the most comprehensive legal clarity to date for dollar-pegged digital assets, many of which operate on Ethereum. The timing of Ethereum’s breakout has fueled speculation that the market may be pricing in the potential impact of this legislation. Ethereum plays a central role in the stablecoin ecosystem. It hosts the largest share of the total stablecoin supply, accounting for $124.5 billion as of May 6, 2025 . Tether (USDT) leads with $64.7 billion, followed by Circle’s USDC at $37 billion. Other notable tokens on Ethereum include USDe, DAI, and PayPal’s PYUSD. From its early days when Ethereum hosted just $124,000 in stablecoins, the network has grown into the primary base layer for tokenized dollars, driving liquidity across decentralized finance, trading, and on-chain payments. According to data from DeFiLlama and CryptoQuant, the total stablecoin market cap recently surpassed $250 billion , with a $33 billion increase so far in 2025 alone. Stablecoin market cap has surged to $228B in 2025, with USDT and USDC driving $33B growth. #Stablecoins #DeFi https://t.co/y68WXWUZM6 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 13, 2025 That expansion has brought renewed activity to the Ethereum network. Exchange-held ERC-20 stablecoin reserves now total $50 billion, while USDC’s reserves alone have grown to $8 billion in 2025. As the House prepares to vote on the GENIUS Act during its so-called “ Crypto Week ,” expectations are high. The GENIUS Act’s passage could cement Ethereum’s position at the center of the dollar-based crypto economy.

48298401,165b18bf-b338-4242-b84a-0fa70b6a771f,1752594775,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/48298401.jpeg,"Why ‘ETH Is Going to $10,000,' Explains EMJ Capital Founder and President",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/15/why-eth-is-going-to-usd10-000-explains-emj-capital-founder-and-president,"On Sunday, Eric Jackson, the founder and president of Toronto-based hedge fund EMJ Capital posted a thread on X that explained his firm's bullishness on ether (ETH). According to Jackson, the market has underestimated the impact of upcoming developments, particularly the anticipated approval of staking for ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by October 2025. He argued that this event, rather than the already-approved ETH ETFs, represents the true catalyst for significant price growth, as it could transform ether into a yield-generating asset attractive to institutional investors. Jackson explained that his firm’s model anticipates a supply crunch driven by several factors. He highlighted that staking approval would likely lead to increased institutional demand, reduced circulating supply, and passive investment flows from traditional finance. Combined with Ethereum's deflationary tokenomics post-merge, growing transaction fees from layer-2 solutions, and the rise of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, he believes these dynamics could significantly boost ETH's value. Jackson emphasized that Ethereum’s ability to generate real revenue positions it as an undervalued network, poised to become an institutional-grade yield product rather than merely a speculative asset. In his analysis, Jackson projected a base case of ether reaching $10,000 by the end of the current market cycle, with a more optimistic scenario of $15,000 or higher if layer-2 adoption and ETF inflows exceed expectations. He noted that while Bitcoin continues to dominate market attention with its price surpassing $120,000, Ethereum is quietly establishing itself as a critical infrastructure for cryptocurrency transactions. Jackson also expressed skepticism about the analogy of Ethereum as “digital oil,” instead suggesting that its role as a foundational platform for commerce in a crypto-driven economy aligns it with companies like Circle, Coinbase, Shopify, and Robinhood. His firm remains bullish, maintaining a long position in the $ETHA ETF and plans to update its model as new developments unfold. With the crypto market struggling today in the wake of the profit-taking that took bitcoin's price in the past two days from above $123,000 to around $116,000, the ether price is holding up relatively well, down only 0.6% in the past 24-hour period at the time of writing. One reason for that is probably the support from Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming (SBET). Earlier today, the firm announced via a post on X that it has solidified its position as the largest corporate holder of ether globally, surpassing even the Ethereum Foundation. The company disclosed that between July 7 and July 13, 2025, it acquired approximately 74,656 ETH for roughly $213 million, at an average price of $2,852 per ETH, bringing its total holdings to around 280,706 ETH. It says that this aggressive acquisition strategy, funded in part by raising $413 million through the sale of 24.5 million shares via its At-The-Market (ATM) facility during the same period, underscores its commitment to making ether its primary treasury reserve asset. The announcement also highlighted that approximately 99.7% of SharpLink’s ETH holdings are actively staked, generating around 415 ETH in staking rewards since the company launched its ETH-focused treasury strategy on June 2, 2025. Additionally, SharpLink reported a 23% increase in its proprietary “ETH Concentration” metric since June 13, 2025, reflecting greater ETH exposure per share. This move aligns with the company’s broader vision, articulated by Chairman Joseph Lubin, a co-founder of Ethereum, to position SharpLink at the forefront of digital commerce by leveraging Ethereum’s utility in decentralized finance and blockchain infrastructure. Technical Analysis According to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model, ETH-USD showcased very high volatility throughout the 24-hour period from July 14 15:00 UTC to July 15 14:00 UTC, establishing a trading corridor of $132.08 that constituted 4% movement between the session's floor at $2,933.50 and ceiling at $3,065.45. The trading session was characterized by sustained bearish pressure during overnight hours, witnessing ETH's descent from $3,013.65 to reach the daily nadir of $2,933.50 approximately at 03:00, subsequently entering a lateral consolidation phase within the $2,960-$2,990 bandwidth throughout the majority of the session. The pivotal moment materialized during the concluding trading hour as ETH orchestrated a spectacular ascent from $3,000.02 to $3,051.89, accumulating $51.87 gains within a single hour accompanied by extraordinary trading activity of 496,321 units — exceeding twice the 24-hour baseline of roughly 225,000. This dynamic surge indicates robust institutional positioning and signals a potential breakthrough beyond the $3,000 psychological barrier that previously constrained upward momentum attempts. ETH-USD exhibited extraordinary price action during the final 60 minutes spanning 15 July 13:08 UTC to 14:07 UTC, accelerating from $3,016.75 to achieve a session pinnacle of $3,065.45 before consolidating at $3,047.00, marking a net appreciation of $30.25 or 1%. The timeframe showcased a compelling breakout narrative commencing at 13:25 when ETH catapulted from $3,017.89 to $3,026.08, succeeded by persistent bullish momentum that reached its zenith during the 13:42 to 13:50 UTC interval, where valuation skyrocketed from $3,029.14 to $3,065.37 — capturing $36.23 appreciation within an 8-minute window as trading activity surged beyond 21,000 units at 13:46, approaching triple the hourly baseline. This powerful advance definitively penetrated the $3,030 resistance threshold and established fresh session peaks, although subsequent profit-realization dynamics surfaced during the concluding 17 minutes, retreating ETH to $3,047.00 amid declining activity that reached zero during the final three minutes, indicating momentary fatigue following the exponential climb.

The slide mirrors broader market jitters after bitcoin (BTC) surged to a record above $120,000, prompting a wave of profit-taking that brought the cryptocurrency back down to $116,000 at the time of writing. The profit-taking trend also comes at a time in which inflation grew to 2.7% in June, as measured by the Consumer Price Index. It’s up from a 2.4% annual increase in May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics For hours, BNB oscillated within a narrow $23 corridor, bouncing between $698.72 and $675.47, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. Buyers showed up near $675, helping stem the slide with a burst of volume exceeding 134,000 tokens traded as prices hit session lows. BNB has since clawed back some ground. Technical signals remain mixed. A downtrend persists, capped by resistance at $690 to $695, a zone where earlier support has flipped into selling pressure. Yet surges in trading activity hint at possible accumulation, as seen in a brief spike of over 1,600 tokens traded in a four-minute window. Various companies have indeed moved to adopt a BNB treasury reserve. The volatility comes as BNB celebrates its eighth anniversary, a milestone that underscores its journey. It’s also recently undergone a $1 billion token burn. BNB is also benefitting from BNB Chain joining the Ondo Global Markets Alliance to bring tokenized securities, which include U.S. stocks, ETFs, and funds, to its network. Whether BNB can break above resistance, or sink lower if profit-taking continues, could shape sentiment for the broader crypto market in coming days.

They say tokens tied to real-world shares like Nvidia, Apple, and even Elon Musk’s Tesla can make global investing easier, but the second you start paying attention, it’s just chaos, fake prices, legal headaches, and zero guardrails. At the end of June, Robinhood , Kraken, Gemini, and Bybit introduced blockchain versions of American stocks and ETFs for users outside the U.S. Robinhood tried to steal the show with a dramatic event in France. They even themed it after a Hitchcock film. But things didn’t go as planned. Their tokens, built for companies like OpenAI and SpaceX that haven’t even gone public, triggered a backlash. OpenAI responded immediately on social media: “We did not partner with Robinhood, were not involved in this, and do not endorse it.” Lithuania’s central bank, which regulates Robinhood’s European operations, contacted the company for clarification. Wild price swings hit tokenized stocks hours after launch On July 3, the AAPLX token—meant to reflect Apple’s stock—hit $236.72, a 12% premium above Apple’s actual price. The Amazon token, AMZNX, spiked to $891.58 just two days later—four times higher than Amazon’s last close. But the biggest dislocation happened that same week on Jupiter, a peer-to-peer trading platform. A single trader tried to buy $500 worth of AMZNX, and that alone sent the token to $23,781.22. That’s over 100x Amazon’s real value. All these tokens were issued by Backed Finance, a Swiss company that rolled them out on June 30 through partnerships with Kraken and Bybit. Backed calls them “xStocks” and claims they’re backed one-to-one with real stocks. When people buy more tokens, the company buys more shares. When people sell, they burn tokens and dump the shares. The idea is that token prices should stay close to the real ones. But in reality, these tokens are barely traded. Liquidity is weak, and a small trade is enough to throw off the price completely, especially on weekends, nights, or holidays when the stock market is shut. A Backed spokesperson allegedly told the Journal that: “We are actively tracking any of these price dislocations and engaging with exchanges to make sure they work to fix this and follow best practices to make sure this does not happen.” But crypto isn’t known for its “best practices,” especially when trades happen on anonymous platforms. Lack of oversight opens doors for abuse The U.S. stock market relies on strict controls. Brokerages verify identities. Exchanges monitor trades. Regulators track suspicious activity. That entire system doesn’t exist here. Backed’s xStocks are “permissionless.” That means they can move between wallets and platforms with zero friction. Kraken might log identities, but Jupiter doesn’t. Once tokens move to a decentralized platform, they’re completely off the radar. Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss argued, “By tokenizing equities, we believe we can export U.S. capital markets anywhere in the world.” But that dream ignores the core problem, which is that stocks traded without transparency or regulation invite disaster. Sure, the blockchain makes transactions public, but names and faces can be permanently hidden, as we’ve seen with North Korea’s Lazarus Group. They might not even be North Korea at all, because we have no way of knowing for sure. And that’s exactly how insider trading and pump-and-dump schemes thrive. Carlos Domingo, CEO of Securitize, called it like it is: “It’s a can of worms and it is going to explode at some point, because people will find ways to do something illegal with these tokens.” And that’s the real risk here. These tokens might look like progress, but they also make it easier for market abuse to go undetected. And there’s zero sign that this was a one-time thing.",OP-ED|Bybit|Gemini|Kraken|Robinhood,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|MARKET|ZRX|ASIA,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-15 15:57:43

In a post on his social media account, Trump declared the week as “Crypto Week” and said that they would make America a global leader in the field of digital assets. Trump made the following statements: Happy Crypto Week! The House of Representatives will vote on a monumental bill that will make America the undisputed #1 leader in digital assets. No one does it better than us! The GENIUS Act will put our great country far ahead of China, Europe, and others. They're trying to catch up, but they won't. Digital assets are the future, and we're clearly ahead! The first vote will take place this afternoon (All Republicans must vote YES!). This is our moment: Digital Assets, GENIUS, Clarity! Making America great again is part of that, bigger and better than ever. We're leading the world, and we'll be working hard with the Senate and House to pass more legislation. Related News: Renowned Analyst Katie Stockton Announces New Bitcoin Price Target Meanwhile, the Trump token, a memecoin named after Trump, is also making headlines. Launched three days before Trump's inauguration, the token was listed on leading cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase within just one day. Coinbase states that it normally conducts a “rigorous” review process before listing new digital assets. The TRUMP token has entered exchanges at an extraordinary pace compared to other major memecoins. However, the large holdings of the token by Trump and his associates pose a risk of potential price manipulation. Indeed, after peaking at $75.35 on April 19th, the token fell rapidly, falling to around $7 in early April. At the time of writing, it was trading at around $9.55. *This is not investment advice.

As the crypto market enters a fresh wave of altcoin enthusiasm, retail and institutional investors alike are tracking one name with growing urgency. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently priced at $0.03 in Phase 5 of its presale, with over 73% of the allocation already sold. More than $12.2 million has been raised from a growing community of 13,200+ holders — and the token’s next jump to $0.035 in Phase 6 is just around the corner. That’s a 20% rise that early entrants are racing to secure before it disappears. With whale wallets rotating out of larger caps like Avalanche (AVAX) and Bitcoin (BTC), and Twitter engagement surging past 12,000 followers, the presale window is rapidly narrowing for what’s becoming the most-watched DeFi launch of the summer. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will bring together two complementary lending systems — a peer-to-contract (P2C) and a peer-to-peer (P2P) model — built to support a wide range of investor strategies. In the P2C design, depositors will be able to place assets such as DAI, USDT, ETH, MATIC, or AVAX into smart contract pools, earning passive returns from borrowers who will interact directly with the protocol. These pools will automatically adjust interest rates based on usage, providing consistent incentives for liquidity providers while offering scalable borrowing access. On the other side, the P2P setup will be tailored for custom loan arrangements. Here, lenders will extend riskier assets — such as DOGE, PEPE, or similar meme coins — under individually negotiated terms. Borrowers and lenders will agree on interest rates, loan durations, and collateral levels, enabling one-on-one deals that cater to niche tokens and higher risk appetites. Layer-2 functionality will sit at the heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s long-term plan. By integrating Layer-2 scaling technology, the platform will dramatically reduce gas fees, speed up transaction finality, and enable seamless onboarding for smaller DeFi users. This upgrade will be critical to reaching mass adoption — and will go live in sync with the token listing. The beta version of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) platform is scheduled to launch alongside the token, ensuring immediate functionality and a clear transition from presale speculation to real-world usage. Whale Rotations, Analyst Projections, and the $100K Early Support Giveaway The excitement surrounding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just hype. Industry experts known for accurately predicting the breakouts of Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP are now tracking MUTM with renewed focus. One respected analyst forecasts the token could reach $0.30 by Q2 2026, representing a 5x surge from the expected listing price of $0.06 and a 10x gain from today’s presale valuation of $0.03. This kind of projection isn’t without precedent. For example, an investor who committed $2,000 during Phase 1 at $0.01 secured 200,000 tokens. Today, that stake is already valued at $6,000, delivering a 200% return before any public trading has even started. If momentum continues as forecasted, the same holding would be worth $60,000 at the analyst’s target price—equivalent to a 30x return on the initial investment. These numbers become even more compelling when compared to the stagnant performance of many large-cap assets. That’s exactly why whales and institutional investors are reallocating profits from established tokens into high-upside opportunities like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also rewarding its early believers. A $100,000 giveaway is live for presale participants, with ten winners each set to receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. Only those who join before the listing will be eligible, further fueling urgency among buyers. On the trust and transparency front, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fully audited by CertiK, with a Token Scan Score of 95.00 and a Skynet Score of 77.5 — confirming the security of its infrastructure at the contract level. With a real product rolling out at launch, a dual lending engine generating native yield, a decentralized stablecoin system in development, and protocol revenue directed back to stakers through buybacks and dividends, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be a long-term infrastructure layer, not just another short-term token. Time Is Running Out Before the Phase 6 Surge With 73% of Phase 5 already sold and over $12.2 million raised, the remaining supply at $0.03 is shrinking fast. The jump to $0.035 in Phase 6 represents a +20% increase — and marks the end of the sub-$0.035 pricing window. Smart capital is entering fast, and social metrics are exploding. For those looking to secure exposure to a real DeFi ecosystem at the ground level, the timing could not be clearer. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving to be one of the strongest contenders of the summer, offering yield, utility, and upside in one package — and once Phase 6 begins, this pricing opportunity will be gone.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-blackrocks-next-plans-for-xrp-may-shock-the-world-heres-why/,"A new video shared by Levi of Crypto Crusaders has ignited a wave of speculation and excitement across the XRP community. Drawing from insights by Matt Hougan, the Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise Asset Management, the video outlines what could be BlackRock’s next major move involving XRP, one that might send shockwaves through the financial world. Matt Hougan’s Bullish Outlook on XRP Matt Hougan is no stranger to bold predictions in the crypto space, and his views on XRP have remained consistently optimistic. According to Levi, Hougan sees XRP as uniquely positioned for institutional adoption due to its efficiency in cross-border payments. He believes XRP could revolutionize global remittances and interbank transfers by offering speed, affordability, and scalability, key weaknesses of the traditional financial system. Hougan reportedly emphasized that XRP’s utility could allow it to play a transformative role in the future of finance , particularly in disrupting SWIFT and similar outdated systems that dominate cross-border money transfers. BlackRock's Next Plans For XRP Will SHOCK THE WORLD – Matt Hougan #XRP pic.twitter.com/LHrJhq3Bzx — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) July 14, 2025 BlackRock Exploring an XRP ETF Perhaps the most explosive claim in Levi’s report is Hougan’s suggestion that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with over $10 trillion in assets under management is actively considering launching an XRP-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). If BlackRock proceeds with this plan, it could open the floodgates for institutional capital to flow into XRP. ETFs serve as an accessible entry point for traditional investors, and a BlackRock-backed XRP ETF would represent a massive endorsement of the asset’s long-term value. Levi notes that such a development could significantly increase demand, boost market liquidity, and positively impact XRP’s price trajectory. Institutional Use Beyond an ETF Hougan’s vision for BlackRock’s involvement with XRP goes even deeper. According to Levi, beyond launching an ETF, BlackRock may also be exploring ways to integrate XRP into its internal financial operations. This could include using XRP for internal settlements to reduce transaction costs and time delays across its vast investment network. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additionally, BlackRock may be evaluating the XRP Ledger (XRPL) as a platform for tokenizing real-world assets. The XRPL offers advanced capabilities for creating and managing digital representations of physical assets like real estate, commodities, or equities. Should BlackRock leverage XRPL for asset tokenization, it could signal a major shift in how traditional finance engages with blockchain technology. A Speculative Yet Serious Development While Hougan himself acknowledges that these developments remain speculative for now, the mere fact that such high-level conversations are taking place speaks volumes. BlackRock’s growing interest in crypto is well-documented, and its foray into XRP could mark the beginning of a new chapter for institutional crypto adoption. As Levi emphasizes, if even part of this vision materializes, the implications for XRP and the broader crypto ecosystem could be enormous. A BlackRock XRP ETF would not only increase investor access but also reinforce XRP’s role in shaping the next generation of global finance. For now, the crypto world watches closely, waiting to see whether BlackRock will take the leap and solidify XRP’s place in institutional portfolios.

Dogecoin (DOGE) is drawing in whales and institutional traders alike, pushing futures volume to over $1.5 billion on Monday. And as attention shifts back to high-risk, high-reward plays, many traders are turning to automation – not because it guarantees wins, but because the right bot can at least tilt the odds in your favor, such as Snorter Bot Token (SNORT) . The most recognized bots in the space such as Banana Gun, Maestro, and Unibot have all originated on Ethereum – a chain that’s notorious for congestion and high gas fees. Snorter takes a different route, being built natively on Solana, where transactions are faster and cheaper by design. Since last year, the network has become the preferred engine for meme coin trading and now, with a purpose-built bot operating directly on it, traders can finally match that speed with execution optimized for it. For those looking to support the development of a sharper tool for spotting high-potential tokens, the SNORT presale is live and has raised nearly $1.9 million. Tokens are available at $0.0981 for the next two hours before the price ticks up to the next presale stage. Meme Coin Volatility Is Back – But Snorter Can Trade the Chaos Meme coins have now topped $70 billion in market capitalization, according to CoinGecko. Since Bitcoin broke its all-time high in May, investors have funneled gains into the industry’s less serious assets, with Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), and Bonk (BONK) climbing 11%, 22.1%, and 26.7% respectively, over the past week. DOGE, boosted by heavy whale accumulation, surged 13.9% in the same timeframe. But the returns across the sector can vary wildly. Among the top 10 meme coins, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) led the pack with a 105% weekly gain – far above the usual 15% to 25% range. Meanwhile, lesser-known tokens like MemeCore (M) have exploded even harder, clocking in at 598% since July 3, driven by the hype around its Layer-1 blockchain built specifically for meme coins. The price action is reminiscent of the speculative frenzy last seen in mid-2023. Yet, spotting tokens on the verge of a breakout is tough to do manually. That’s where crypto trading bots like Snorter Token help level the playing field for retail traders. As mentioned earlier, Snorter’s Solana-native foundation gives it a clear edge in execution. Unlike Ethereum-based bots that often get bogged down by high fees and network congestion, Snorter is meant for high-frequency trading, exactly the kind of environment Telegram bots are meant to thrive in. Snorter Token is Built Exactly for the Traders Who Never Log Off Snorter is designed for the rhythm of meme coin season, when new tokens drop without warning, and seconds determine a winning trade from a losing trade. As mentioned, it runs directly inside Telegram, so trades happen in the same space where calls, rumors, and alpha get posted in real time. What makes Snorter stand out isn’t just the execution speed, though, but also the full environment it builds around the trader. It features real-time feed monitoring, wallet mirroring, and sniper configurations, and it compresses the entire trading flow into a single, responsive interface. Essentially, with these features, users can track wallets, set up sniper parameters to auto-buy tokens based on specific triggers, and deploy swaps instantly. And with MEV protection built in, trades land cleanly without being front-run by predatory bots. Snorter also helps flag contracts with red flags – including honeypots, which let you buy but block you from selling – giving traders added security in a market filled with stealth launches and fast-moving traps. On Solana, tokens regularly 2x within the first minute of launch on DEX Screener – often before Telegram groups or X even react. With Snorter, that early edge becomes accessible to retail. Snorter is also structured for expansion. As mentioned, multi-chain support is on the roadmap, and community proposals will soon guide its direction from what gets prioritized next to how features evolve. The end goal is a trading bot that’s intuitive enough to become a full-on crypto trading command center – one that’s ready for a renewed meme coin season in 2025. How to Buy SNORT at a Discount In short, trading the meme coin market – especially with buying activity surging again – is nearly impossible without automation. But if you think any trading bot will do the job, you’d be mistaken. Once launched, one of Snorter’s biggest advantages – beyond its speed and functionality – is its cost-efficiency. Simply holding SNORT unlocks execution fees as low as 0.85% – the lowest in the space. Most competing bots charge between 1% and 2%, making Snorter a clear value pick for active traders aiming to maximize returns. And of course, SNORT tokens aren’t just a currency within the tool – they’re exposure to the ecosystem itself, with future rewards, governance rights, and utility baked in for those who want a stake in how the platform evolves. If you’re ready to back it, head to the Snorter Token presale site and secure your SNORT using SOL, ETH, BNB, USDT, USDC, or a credit card. SNORT tokens bought in the presale can generate passive returns through its own staking pool that currently offers a dynamic 207% APY. For the smoothest experience, use Best Wallet – the only Web3 wallet that shows your SNORT balance in-app and gives early access to new token launches through its exclusive ‘Upcoming Tokens’ section. Download Best Wallet now on Google Play or the Apple App Store . Follow Snorter Token on X and Instagram for the latest updates.

Kendrick, writing in a note Tuesday after a week-long trip through Washington, New York and Boston, said there’s a growing consensus among crypto industry players, fund managers and policymakers that this $750 billion mark would be the tipping point where stablecoins begin to influence government debt issuance, monetary policy and the structure of U.S. Treasury markets through sheer demand. The current stablecoin market stands at about $240 billion. But Kendrick’s contacts expect it could more than triple by the end of 2026, driven by broadening use and regulatory clarity, particularly if the bipartisan GENIUS Act becomes law — a move that could happen as early as next week. “In the U.S., once the stablecoin market gets to a certain size, the amount of T-bills required to back stablecoins will likely require a shift in planned issuance across the curve towards more T-bill issuance, less longer-tenor issuance,” Kendrick wrote. “This potentially has implications for the shape of the U.S. Treasury yield curve and demand for USD assets.” Stablecoins — cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a fixed value, usually $1 — are typically backed by cash-equivalent reserves, most often short-term U.S. government debt. As demand rises, so too does the need to hold vast quantities of Treasury bills, putting stablecoins on a potential collision course with traditional fixed income markets. Kendrick met with a cross-section of market participants during his U.S. visit, including Bitcoin miners, crypto-native firms, traditional hedge funds and policymakers, he said. Their near-unanimous focus: stablecoins. Market participants expect a wave of stablecoin issuance, not just from crypto firms, but possibly from banks and even local governments. Emerging markets may be the most immediately affected. Kendrick flagged concerns that individuals in these regions are using stablecoins as a digital savings vehicle, pulling capital away from local banking systems and central bank reserves. That could challenge financial stability in countries that rely on U.S. dollar liquidity to manage fixed exchange rates or capital controls. On the U.S. front, stablecoins could shift corporate treasuries away from traditional banking and into tokenized cash alternatives. But how much of their cash businesses move on-chain — and how fast — remains uncertain. The growing attention is reflected in public markets. Shares of Circle (CRCL), the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, have surged 540% since its public debut last month. The run-up signals investor confidence in stablecoins as a central pillar of the next phase of digital finance.",Markets|Stablecoins|News,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-15 16:06:37

The 30-year yield edged down by more than a basis point to 4.958%, the 10-year yield also slipped by one basis point to 4.419%, while the 2-year held firm at 3.9%. Investors are waiting on the release of June CPI data, which most Wall Street analysts expect to reveal the impact of President Trump’s tariffs . Eastspring Investments warned , however, “If tariffs begin to show up clearly in the US June CPI data … US bond markets could sell off to reflect the higher inflation risk brought about by [US President Donald] Trump’s recent tariff escalation.” The CPI figures will influence markets significantly, say analysts Eastspring Investments also cautioned that a weaker-than-anticipated CPI could prompt the US government to treat tariffs as a painless revenue stream to offset tax cuts outlined in the “big beautiful bill.” Earlier, Mark Cabana, head of US rates strategy at BofA Securities, stated that an inflation rise could make traders reconsider their expectations on Federal policy. So far, the probability of a rate cut in September now stands at around 65%, down from a near-certain prediction. He further argued that an inflation hike will compel a market pause. Zachary Griffiths, CreditSights’ head of investment grade and macroeconomic strategy, also stated that the CPI data will dictate the Federal Reserve’s next move and risk sentiment for the rest of the year. Also, like many other analysts, Tracy Chen, a portfolio manager at Brandywine, said traders would see the tariff war’s impact in the CPI numbers. Meanwhile, White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett suggested the Trump administration is looking into legal options to dismiss Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell . He remarked, “But certainly, if there’s cause, he does,” referring to Trump’s authority to dismiss Powell if there’s reason to. Despite Trump’s public assurances that he has no plans to dismiss Powell, Hassett’s comments suggest the White House is still weighing the possibility. The Trump administration has been increasing its attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell lately. Officials have been pushing for the investigation into Powell’s oversight of the central bank headquarters’ renovation project, potentially as a basis for dismissing him before his term concludes. However, analysts, including Deutsche Bank strategist George Saravelos, predict that his premature removal could trigger a selloff in both the dollar and US Treasuries. Japan’s election and Trump’s trade tariffs affected long-term bond yields globally Worldwide, government debt , particularly long-term bonds, has also faced pressure. Meanwhile, yields in Japan have fueled expectations of increased spending and tax cuts. Long-term bond yields have also risen in Germany and France, as investors demand higher compensation for funding higher defense budgets. More broadly, Japan’s election and Trump’s capricious tariff pronouncements reignited general concerns over increasing government debt, unrestrained spending, an oversupply of bonds, and rising inflation in developed economies. Speaking to Bloomberg Radio on Monday, George Bory, chief investment strategist, fixed income at Allspring Global Investments, confirmed that there’s a huge tendency for countries to rely on deficit spending, adding that“ the relief valve is the long end of the curve.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",Economy|Federal Reserve|Treasury Department,EN,0,0,REGULATION|FIAT|ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-15 16:10:12

The country wants DLT - the blockchain technology that underpins crypto - to be utilized across different sectors in wholesale financial markets and create cross market groups ""to take forward live activity,"" the country's Treasury said in a policy paper. A part of the plan includes creating a regulatory framework for crypto technology, something which is already underway as the nation sets out to be a crypto hub. The U.K. published draft legislation for the stablecoin issuers and exchanges in April . ""For instance, on digital wholesale payments the government and regulators are open to proposals that innovate on existing forms of payment, such as tokenised deposits, and also new innovations such as stablecoins,"" said Treasury. The government wants to enable the sector to test solutions that tokenize financial assets and help digitize post trade processes. Worldwide, RWA tokenization has grown by 380% in just three years and reached $24 billion this month, according to a first-half 2025 report from RedStone, Gauntlet and RWA.xyz . U.K. regulators will also test using stablecoins - digital tokens pegged to assets - alongside other payment solutions in the new digital securities sandbox.

Not safe-haven demand, making it more akin to the S&P 500 than gold. Key catalysts include regulatory moves like the Genius Act and political dynamics undermining monetary policy credibility. In my opinion, we can talk about institutionalization, until proven otherwise, as an “anti‑liberalization” of Bitcoin. But this certainly doesn’t mean less demand. But watch out for traps. With increasing overextension, the attractiveness of taking a position could decrease compared to ""alts"". Bitcoin does not follow macroeconomics, but above all, it is not a safe-haven asset . At least not right now. What drives the price of Bitcoin is not fear but rather a de- liberalization , or better said, a phase of institutionalization/regulation that could be truly epochal. Here’s my opinion: we must not make the mistake of treating it like gold; perhaps we should make the effort to treat it more like the S&P 500 . And now that the market has flipped the risk‑on switch, my attention once again turns to Bitcoin. And not only that . But first, let me share with you… My bullish view on BTC It diverges from the idea that a weak dollar and expectations of a rate cut are a panacea for BTC demand. I prefer to identify two other catalysts: institutionalization and monetary instability. Simply, two threads: The “fight” between President Donald Trump and Jerome Powell The Genius Act Not tariffs: I consider it too simplistic to say that Bitcoin demand increases because of the instability generated by tariffs. It would be like supporting the classic dynamic “bitcoin = safe asset haven,” which we have seen does not match real danger situations. For those who still embrace Bitcoin today as a challenger to the modern monetary system, I think following the two narrative threads I have identified is more consistent. The two catalysts to remember Simply put, the fact that President Donald Trump directly steps in to undermine Powell , and by doing so influences monetary policy decisions, is an important historical inconsistency. For Bitcoin, it’s as if its fiercest enemy were saying, “Hey, you were right, we’re not that efficient.” Of course, this part of my analysis is more storytelling than data‑driven analysis, but I can’t help finding in it a very theatrical, fascinating narrative. Especially when I frame the story with the stablecoin regulation process, defined as the Genius Act, here, I find a logical reason in the weakness of the dollar, but also in Gary Gensler’s exit from the SEC , and coming back to us, the introduction of a new monetary system. Therefore, both the Genius Act, the Clarity Act (regulatory framework for crypto), and the Anti‑CBDC Surveillance State Act . In one word: institutionalization. Makes you think, doesn’t it? A bullish phase, because it increases demand, but not so close to the “liberal” concept of Bitcoin from 2010, even though that propaganda is still very much alive among supporters, but let’s see if between this narrative and the data there is actually a formal correlation. In numbers: If I look for signs of institutionalization, first of all, I look at the flows in the USA spot Bitcoin ETFs, and I notice that they have over $138 billion in AUM. Not really a typical feature of a market with less than 3 years of experience. IBIT: Example of AUM of the most capitalized ETF (Seeking Alpha) Another sign of institutionalization? The volatility, hasn't anyone noticed a drop in Bitcoin’s volatility? How many remember 2021, when you woke up in the morning and realized that during the night the portfolio had registered a positive fluctuation of 10% and then maybe a negative of 15%? Well, the 30-day rolling volatility drops to 35% , while before 2022, it was over 100%. IBIT – Example of how volatility has halved compared to the average (Seeking Alpha) But do you know what confirms to me that the bullish movement is driven by this (allow me the term) artificial process? The comparison with a real safe asset heaven: Bitcoin has a trend substantially disconnected from gold , which actually is ONLY a safe asset heaven, even if the dollar is falling. But what does this discrepancy really mean? In essence, the market is not looking for protection but for risk . Data by YCharts And if Bitcoin is in demand, it means that it is treated more like an S&P 500 , a signal of the fact that it follows “earnings-driven” narratives, even if naturally it has no earnings, but more similar to the accumulation methodologies of institutions. Data by YCharts Risk: “Yes, alright, it may make sense, so will it keep growing endlessly?” In the end, that’s what we really want to know. Let’s look at some numbers: of Bitcoin traders, 86% are in profit, 13% at break‑even , and only 1% in loss. Simply put, if we’re at ATH, how is it possible that 13% are at breakeven? Here’s the point: after all these words, I’ve come to this to tell you that this piece of information can be read by many in a contrarian sense. It basically shows there are a lot of buyers at the highs, which becomes even more worrying if you consider a Large Transactions Volume of $164.28B : clearly a sign of euphoria but also of strong hands intervening, who tend to play on these retail imbalances. (Of course, this is my personal opinion.) IBIT (Seeking Alpha) Well, it’s a risk, especially considering that this is the first year Bitcoin’s price is below the stock‑to‑flow level at 463 days in the yellow range of the post‑halving day distribution. It’s anomalous. Bear market... or alt season If you got scared, know that this is not enough for me to call a downgrade on Bitcoin. Because the narrative is still promising, in my opinion. Rather, this seems to me like a typical phase of an alt season, that is, a market phase in which very positive idiosyncratic drivers develop for smaller cryptocurrencies. Data by YCharts In other words, it is statistically likely that, with Bitcoin already in an upper‑extreme zone, the market could shift part of its resources toward alternative assets, potentially those that have been “left behind,” and of course, ETH immediately comes to mind, and I’ve talked about it here as well. An element that, in fact, would remain close to the institutionalized narrative, considering the launch of ETFs. Conclusion To conclude, I remain close to the bullish narrative on BTC, while keeping an eye on the imbalance in the distribution of demand and supply, which could generate short‑term volatility, such as a fake breakout above the highs. In this sense, I look favorably on alternatives, and I think the market will too.

The integration enables users to buy and trade cryptocurrency quickly without needing to enter their card or wallet details. This initiative is a significant step toward connecting traditional banking with the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. MoonPay Leverages Revolut Pay to Make Digital Payments Easier The MoonPay platform enables businesses and users to switch between traditional fiat currency and cryptocurrency seamlessly. It offers simple tools that help people buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on-ramps and off-ramps. Users can pay using familiar methods, such as credit cards and bank transfers. MoonPay serves as the middle layer, making the process smooth and user-friendly. Previously, users had to enter their card or banking details each time they manually made a cryptocurrency payment. However, with Revolut Pay integrated into MoonPay’s system, crypto payments on the platform are now fast, easy, and seamless. MoonPay Plans to Expand Easy Crypto Payment Globally Currently, the MoonPay–Revolut Pay integration is only available to users in the UK and EEA. The service is accessible to users in countries like France, Germany, Ireland, and the Netherlands. In 2024, MoonPay received approval under the European MiCA regulation, which now allows it to operate in these countries. Nevertheless, the platform has said it plans to expand this service to other markets in the future through its global partner network. This is part of its broader strategy to build a more seamless and global crypto payment service. This partnership adds to MoonPay’s recent momentum. Just weeks ago, it teamed up with Tether and Rumble to launch the upcoming Rumble crypto wallet, which is expected to be released in Q3 2025. Revolut Pay Expands as Crypto Demand Grows Revolut Pay, launched in 2022, offers one-click payments to simplify checkout for users and merchants. Revolut Pay is live in major markets including the UK, EEA, US, and India. The platform currently serves more than 60 million users worldwide, and out of these, 9 million are active crypto users. Its new partnership with MoonPay comes as the company nears a $1 billion funding round led by Greenoaks. This suggests that the company is preparing for even more growth, and crypto is a big part of that plan. Furthermore, this innovation also aligns with the growing interest in cryptocurrency across Europe. According to Gemini’s 2025 State of Crypto report, 24% of UK adults now own cryptocurrency, up from 18% in 2024. This is the most significant year-over-year jump in any surveyed country. In France, the ownership of cryptocurrencies also rose from 18% to 21% over the past year. In Italy, nearly half of crypto owners who hold Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) now invest in spot crypto ETFs. This shows how mainstream digital assets have become.

Trading volumes have remained above $1 billion for six straight days, with a total of $9.4 billion in PEPE traded during this period, signaling growing demand and supporting a bullish Pepe price prediction in the near term. Adding fuel to the fire, the SEC recently acknowledged a filing from Canary Capital to list a Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) ETF, sparking speculation that PEPE could be the next meme coin to receive ETF treatment. Open interest in PEPE futures has also exploded since April 2025, jumping from $200 million to $685 million — a clear sign that investor and trader interest in the token is accelerating fast. Pepe Price Prediction: High Volumes During Accumulation Anticipate Big Move Ahead for PEPE $PEPE Is About To Go Parabolic. pic.twitter.com/8ADi1PXamk — JAKE (@JakeGagain) July 15, 2025 Popular crypto trader @JakeGagain recently shared a video outlining a bullish Pepe (PEPE) price prediction , highlighting its strong correlation with Ethereum (ETH) . While ETH has yet to reach a new all-time high — unlike Bitcoin — Gagain believes it’s only a matter of time before Ethereum rallies, taking PEPE along for the ride. Gagain also predicted that PEPE will become the top-performing meme coin of this cycle, even going so far as to say it could flip Shiba Inu (SHIB) to become the second most valuable meme coin globally. On the technical side, PEPE broke above a key three-touch trend line resistance last Wednesday and surged the next day, tagging its 200-day EMA before entering a 5-day consolidation phase. This price action looks like classic accumulation , potentially setting the stage for a breakout toward the next liquidity target at $0.00001600 . Adding fuel to the fire, the 9-day and 21-day EMAs have just completed a bullish crossover — a strong buy signal known as a golden cross that often precedes explosive upside moves. Pepe’s high trading volumes, even with muted price movement, suggest that quiet accumulation is underway. It may not hit $1 anytime soon, but signs point to a move higher in the near future. As big players prepare for the next breakout, top crypto presales like SUBBD are gaining momentum, offering major upside to early investors.

These developments have sparked interest in Ondo’s native token, which has failed to reclaim the $1 mark since early March declines. Merging TradFi and blockchain Cryptocurrency and traditional finance have operated differently over the years. Digital assets operated as speculative, experimental, and fast-moving assets, whereas TradFi remained highly regulated and restricted to investors with access to banks or brokers. Meanwhile, Ondo Finance emerged to change the narrative. It has made strategic moves in the real-world asset tokenization sector. For instance, MasterCard integrated Ondo Finance as its first RWA provider in February. Also, Ripple tapped the blockchain to introduce tokenized US treasuries on the XRPL. The new collaboration with BNB Chain will allow users to interact with the digital representations of recognized US ETFs and stocks. These are digital assets backed by real-world assets, offering seamless access for investors looking to diversify beyond cryptocurrencies while within the blockchain world. BNB Chain commented on the latest partnership, stating: With Ondo’s suite of tokenized real-world assets, you’ll enjoy simpler access to US equities without ever leaving BNB Chain. That means users need a smartphone and a cryptocurrency wallet to invest in tokenized shares of leading companies like Tesla and Apple, or exchange-traded funds on the Binance ecosystem.

Markets are now pricing in “Crypto Week,” a key regulatory event , as the CLARITY Act market structure bill, GENIUS Act stablecoin bill, and Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act face the U.S. House. Shiba Inu Price Analysis: Is the Stage Set for $1 While a $1 Shiba Inu price remains speculative, the token’s increasingly bullish fundamentals add weight to the long-term case. The recent launch of DegenSafe, SHIB’s response to Solana’s meme coin launchpads, and ongoing token burns could lift prices through increased adoption and scarcity. Even without these catalysts fully priced in, the technical setup still points higher, backed by a developing six-month double bottom pattern. SHIB / USDT 1-week chart, double bottom pattern. Source: TradingView, Binance. Since its second bottom in mid-June, the Shiba Inu price has pushed steadily toward a breakout above the neckline at $0.0000177. Momentum indicators continue to support the move. The RSI has rebounded from oversold territory in the 30s, climbing toward neutral as buying pressure returns. More so, the MACD line continues to widen its lead over the signal line after a short-lived death cross, signaling underlying strength and a potential longer-term uptrend. If the double bottom plays out, SHIB could see a 93% surge, targeting a higher resistance zone stretching back to early January at $0.000025. However, its full potential hinges on a successful break above its neckline. Still, that move hinges on a clean break above the neckline. Until then, $0.000012 remains the key support to watch. Losing it risks a third bottom at $0.00001, invalidating the setup. SHIB Might Not Be The Best Meme Coin Narrative to Follow The truth is, SHIB has been in the background for months as traders chased fresher narratives. On the speculative meme coin scene, attention is the fuel that drives price moves. Few stand to capitalize on this momentum as much as “mission coins,” the purest form of meme coin, fueled purely by a devoted community. We are at a pivot point. Dozens more launchpads will come. Millions of gamble coins will come and go.

During this period, dubbed “Crypto Week,” two important bills to be voted on in the House of Representatives could pave the way for the establishment of a long-awaited legal framework for digital assets. GENIUS Act: Stablecoins The GENIUS Act, a stablecoin bill that has already passed the Senate, will be voted on Thursday in the House of Representatives. If passed, it would mark the first time in US history that independent cryptocurrency regulation has been enacted. The Trump administration supports this process. The House of Representatives, having abandoned the previous version, took up the new version after President Donald Trump called on Truth Social, “No delays, no addendums, bring it to my desk now.” CLARITY: The Status of Cryptocurrencies However, the industry's biggest hope lies in the CLARITY Act, a bill that would clarify whether digital assets are securities or commodities. This bill aims to clearly divide regulatory powers between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The bill is scheduled for a vote in the House of Representatives on Wednesday and is expected to pass after passing committees with bipartisan support. However, its progress in the Senate is less clear. Democrats are wary of the bill due to the Trump family's crypto investments. Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock, despite supporting the GENIUS Act, stating that “Trump’s crypto corruption is corrupting the digital asset market,” did not show the same commitment to CLARITY. Coinbase, aiming to boost support for the CLARITY Act, distributed nearly 5,000 chocolate bars across Washington to highlight the law's importance. The company noted on the packaging that nearly one-fifth of Americans own crypto, according to a Morning Consult poll. Related News: US President Donald Trump Makes Hot Remarks on Cryptocurrencies - Shares a Long Statement Coinbase, Ripple, and other crypto companies are urging members of Congress to support them, arguing that a clearer regulatory framework would boost investor confidence. “Consumers want to know what they're getting into when they buy and sell these assets and that they're using a trusted intermediary,” said Kara Calvert, Coinbase's Vice President of U.S. Public Policy. The Senate is preparing to introduce its own market structure regulation this month, which will differ from the House version. Republican Senators Tim Scott and Cynthia Lummis are working on the legislation, while Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand plans to support it with a bipartisan approach. “We have a lot of work to do, and we will be working in a bipartisan manner over the next month,” Gillibrand told CNBC. Bill to Ban CBDC Another key item for the crypto industry is a separate bill that would ban the Federal Reserve from issuing digital dollars (CBDCs).This bill is also expected to be passed by the House of Representatives on Wednesday. Blockchain Association CEO Summer Mersinger expressed support for the bill, saying, “If this is something the private sector should be doing, the government should not be the competitor.” *This is not investment advice.

Moving beyond its traditional role as a simple forum for neighborhood chatter, the platform is launching a comprehensive redesign aimed at becoming a more indispensable utility for communities. This ambitious overhaul introduces cutting-edge AI, direct integration of local news, and critical real-time emergency alerts, signaling a strategic pivot towards a more structured, helpful, and timely user experience. For those accustomed to the rapid evolution of digital platforms, Nextdoor’s bold move underscores the growing demand for reliable, accessible information at the local level. Revolutionizing Local Discovery with AI Recommendations One of the most exciting additions to the new Nextdoor experience is ‘Faves,’ an innovative feature powered by artificial intelligence designed to help users discover the best local businesses and hidden gems. Imagine needing a reliable plumber or the perfect family-friendly restaurant, and instead of sifting through generic search results, you get tailored suggestions based on years of genuine neighbor conversations. This is precisely what Faves aims to deliver. Powered by Hyperlocal AI: Nextdoor boasts an LLM (Large Language Model) specifically trained on 15 years of neighbor-generated content. This proprietary dataset allows the AI to understand and answer questions with a truly local context, a capability currently unmatched by broader platforms like Google or ChatGPT. Curated Suggestions: Users can ask specific questions, such as, “What is the best place to hike with kids?” and receive quick, summarized responses. These summaries are directly linked to the original posts from real users, ensuring transparency and trust. Proprietary Data Advantage: Nextdoor CEO and co-founder Nirav Tolia emphasized that this content is unique to Nextdoor, unindexed by external search engines. This positions the Nextdoor app as the go-to source for the kind of invaluable word-of-mouth information that defines local life – from finding a child’s lemonade stand to discovering a beloved, quirky local shop. Bringing Hyperlocal Local News to Your Doorstep To enhance the quality and quantity of information available, Nextdoor is integrating professional journalism directly into the app. This marks a significant shift from relying solely on user-generated content, acknowledging the importance of verified, timely reporting for a truly informed community. Nextdoor has forged partnerships with 3,500 local publications across the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, including notable names like the San Francisco Standard, The London Standard, and The Toronto Star. This collaboration is designed to be mutually beneficial, as Nirav Tolia explained to Bitcoin World: “The reason that this is so important for us is historically, Nextdoor has relied 100% on user-generated content, just the content that’s created by your neighbors. That’s been a great source of information. But, to really make sure if it’s happening in your neighborhood, we need to bring in local news as well. So this is the first time we’re letting third party publishers use our distribution.” The agreements are non-commercial; Nextdoor doesn’t pay for the content, nor do publishers pay Nextdoor. The app simply displays a headline, a snippet, and an image, directing traffic to the publishers’ websites. This ensures that users have access to reliable local reporting while supporting local journalism. A dedicated section under each post will allow neighbors to discuss the news, fostering community dialogue around relevant local events. Critical Safety with Real-Time Alerts In moments of crisis, timely information can be life-saving. The redesigned Nextdoor app introduces a robust real-time alert system for events like severe weather, traffic incidents, power outages, storms, and wildfires. These alerts are displayed on a dynamic neighborhood map, enabling neighbors to engage in immediate conversations about safety and preparedness. To power these crucial updates, Nextdoor has partnered with Samdesk and Weather.com (including The Weather Channel app). Tolia detailed the alert system’s urgency levels: Yellow State: For important, attention-worthy events, alerts appear prominently at the top of the app. Red State: For critical, life-threatening situations, the alert takes over the entire app screen, ensuring immediate attention. As Tolia emphasized, “at that point, you don’t care about the conversations neighbors are having about pickleball. You don’t really care about the new restaurant review that the local publishers put in. You need to get together with your neighbors and help save each other’s lives in some cases.” What truly sets Nextdoor’s alerts apart is their hyper-localization. Built on a geospatial platform, the app can personalize alerts down to an individual house. Unlike broad Amber Alerts, if a power outage affects only a specific block, only residents on that block will receive the notification, minimizing unnecessary alerts and maximizing relevance. Beyond a Neighborhood Social Network: A Utility-Centric Future For years, Nextdoor has served as a popular, albeit sometimes controversial, platform for neighborhood interactions. While it excelled at connecting people for recommendations or lost pets, it also faced challenges with misinformation and instances of racism, leading to stalled growth and declining engagement. With this significant redesign, Nextdoor is determined to turn the tide, repositioning itself from merely a neighborhood social network to an essential, utility-centric service. The company’s focus is squarely on increasing the quality and quantity of local information. By integrating professional news and hyper-localized alerts, Nextdoor aims to provide a more valuable and reliable resource. This shift is not just about new features; it’s about a fundamental change in philosophy – making the platform more helpful, useful, and timely for everyday life. Looking ahead, Nextdoor plans to further expand its content ecosystem. Tolia noted that publishers are just the first step; in the future, the platform intends to allow small businesses, schools, and various organizations to establish native presences within the app, creating an even richer tapestry of local information and services. The Vision from the Top: CEO Nirav Tolia’s Insights Nirav Tolia’s vision for the “new Nextdoor” is clear: to digitize and capture the invaluable essence of local word-of-mouth. He firmly believes that the kind of hyperlocal information available on Nextdoor is simply not found on global platforms. “I give the funny example of, if you wanted to know all the lemonade stands that kids are operating in your neighborhood, you can’t go to Google Maps and find that,” Tolia remarked. “You can’t go to ChatGPT and ask that question, right? The only way is for you to ask your neighbors. And so that’s what Nextdoor is all about.” This renewed commitment to being truly hyperlocal, combined with sophisticated AI recommendations and vital real-time alerts , is set to redefine the platform’s utility. By blending neighbor-generated insights with professional content and critical safety tools, Nextdoor is striving to be less of a casual social network and more of an indispensable tool for community life, ensuring that when something important happens in your neighborhood, you’re the first to know. The redesign of the Nextdoor app represents a pivotal moment for the platform. By embracing advanced AI, integrating trusted local news, and delivering critical real-time alerts, Nextdoor is not just updating its interface; it’s fundamentally reshaping its purpose. This transformation aims to solve past challenges of misinformation and declining engagement by offering unparalleled utility and hyper-local relevance. As communities increasingly seek reliable information and stronger connections, Nextdoor’s strategic pivot positions it as an essential digital companion for modern neighborhood life, promising a more informed, safer, and connected future for its users.

Since its low point during that month, Bitcoin is up 668%. The iShares Bitcoin ETF ( IBIT ) has been the fastest-growing ETF of all time, eclipsing $70 billion in assets in less than 18 months and currently up to $85 billion. That's already big enough to rank it in the top 20 or so of the largest "" mega-ETFs "" in the US. Since its closing price on launch day back on January 11th, 2024, IBIT is up 156%. That compares to gains of 36% for the Nasdaq 100 ETF ( QQQ ) and 31% for the S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ). Compared to current S&P 500 stocks, IBIT's gain of 156% since it launched on 1/11/24 would rank 12th in terms of performance.

However, while ADA eyes a nearly 7x return from current levels, emerging AI-focused token Ozak AI presents an even more explosive opportunity. Now in its fourth presale stage at just $0.005, Ozak AI has already raised over $1.34 million, positioning itself as a high-upside play with potential 200x returns if it reaches its $1 target. As AI adoption gains momentum across crypto and tech, Ozak AI’s predictive intelligence platform, built on DePIN and real-time data architecture, offers a futuristic edge that could rival established layer-1s like Cardano in the next bull cycle. Will Cardano Reach $3 in 2025? Cardano, presently trading around the $0.40–$0.85 range, is targeting a return to its former glory. In the 2021 bull cycle, ADA reached an all-time high of $3.10, using the wave of smart contract integration and ecosystem growth. Although it has given that retraced appreciably, recent enhancements and growing software are positioning ADA for a comeback One of the key catalysts is the Chang hard fork, a major replacement aimed toward improving governance and permitting network-led innovation on Cardano. This shift closer to complete decentralization is expected to noticeably increase network engagement and growth developer interest. Coupled with constant progress in Cardano's DeFi surroundings, including the upward thrust of DEXs like Minswap and projects like Liqwid and Indigo, the blockchain is gaining traction once again. Technical analysis suggests that if bullish momentum returns to the market, ADA could test key resistance levels at $1.20, $2, and eventually $3. Long-term support is firm around $0.30, $0.50, and $0.80, which gives bulls confidence that the floor is rising. With a strong foundation, Cardano’s goal of reaching $3 in 2025 is far from unrealistic—especially if macroeconomic conditions and regulatory clarity improve across the crypto sector. Ozak AI: The High-Risk, High-Reward Challenger While Cardano is leaning on its history and technical improvements, Ozak AI is making waves for its futuristic vision and aggressive growth potential. Priced at just $0.005 during its 4th presale stage, Ozak AI has already raised over $1.34 million, suggesting early investor confidence in its roadmap and fundamentals. Ozak AI operates at the intersection of artificial intelligence and decentralized infrastructure. It brings to market a platform that leverages real-time data analytics, predictive modeling, and decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN). Its core components—such as the Ozak Stream Network (OSN), Prediction Agents (PAs), and Data Vaults—offer practical tools for enterprises and individuals looking to make data-driven decisions in finance, logistics, and other sectors. Unlike many presale tokens that ride on hype without clear utility, Ozak AI is targeting real-world integration. Its architecture is built to scale with demand, making it highly attractive in a world rapidly adopting AI for decision automation and optimization. Given the global surge in AI interest and its integration into everything from search engines to trading algorithms, Ozak AI stands out as a project with both narrative appeal and technical merit. With the token still in presale, many see this as a rare chance to get in at the ground level. A 200x move from $0.005 to $1 is entirely feasible if Ozak AI launches successfully, secures partnerships, and meets its roadmap milestones by the next bull cycle. ADA or OZ: Which Has the Stronger Upside? Comparing Cardano and Ozak AI is like comparing a blue-chip tech stock to a high-growth startup. ADA offers relative stability, proven infrastructure, and ecosystem momentum. It is well-suited for those looking for consistent, lower-risk gains. If ADA reaches $3, that would equate to a 6–7x return from current levels—impressive for a top 10 coin, but limited compared to micro-cap potential. Ozak AI , on the other hand, represents the kind of moonshot that crypto enthusiasts dream about. A $500 investment at $0.005 could become $100,000 if it reaches $1. Of course, the risks are significantly higher, but so are the potential rewards. It's not a question of which is better, but which fits your risk profile and portfolio strategy. Both projects reflect different sides of crypto's appeal—Cardano with its academic rigor and steady evolution, and Ozak AI with its futuristic promise and market-timing opportunity. As the 2025 bull market inches closer, smart investors are evaluating both legacy altcoins and innovative newcomers. Cardano’s path to $3 is paved with years of development, upgrades like Chang, and growing on-chain activity. It's a solid bet for those who believe in long-term fundamentals and blockchain utility. Meanwhile, Ozak AI’s journey from $0.005 to $1 offers a thrilling opportunity for exponential returns. For early movers who understand the risks of investing in presale tokens, it could be a portfolio-changing play. In the end, diversification may be key. Balancing the proven strength of ADA with the explosive potential of OZ could provide a well-rounded exposure to the next big wave in crypto.

The blockchain now hosts over $528 million in real-world assets, marking its biggest month ever. PayPal’s move to build on Stellar’s fast, low-cost network might have ignited the rally, while rising TVL and RWA dominance position $XLM as a top contender for institutional adoption. Stellar Records Highest TVL, On-chain Usage, and RWA Momentum July 2025 marked a historic month for Stellar as its total value locked (TVL) reached an unprecedented $140.7 million. This milestone was driven by the accelerating growth of native DeFi liquidity. Network activity mirrored this expansion, with Artemis Analytics reporting 2.1 million daily transactions and 8.7 million processed operations. The number of weekly unique active addresses also increased to 266,800, representing a 37% monthly rise. Independent data from Token Terminal confirmed this trajectory, showing weekly active wallets consistently surpassing 240,000. Institutional adoption also increased as PayPal partnered with Stellar for the integration of its PYUSD stablecoin. PayPal’s blockchain chief, Ian Burrill, explained that the decision would leverage Stellar’s high-speed, low-cost infrastructure to transform global remittances and enterprise payments. Imagine sending low-cost payments internationally that settle instantly.

Stellar’s real-world asset (RWA) market demonstrated equally impressive growth. The network processed over $17 billion in on-chain volume while maintaining $450 million in tokenized RWA, according to recent data . Stellar ranks among the top blockchains for RWAs (Source: RWA.xyz ) These figures solidify Stellar’s position as a premier blockchain for asset-backed tokens. Franklin Templeton is leading the way in RWA tokenization and organically chose Stellar $XLM to tokenize their financial assets, and as more institutions recognize the power of Stellar, others will follow.

These technical advancements coincided with Stellar’s strong 72% price appreciation during the month. The ecosystem is also preparing for a transformative shift. The Stellar Foundation has scheduled its first on-chain governance vote for August 14, 2025, which is vital as a fundamental move toward decentralized, community-led protocol development. XLM/USDT Holds Bullish Momentum—Key Levels to Watch as Price Tests $0.475 Resistance $XLM/USDT has been in a firm upward trend, with price climbing from the $0.36 region on July 12 to trade near $0.4647 as of July 15. This rally broke through several previous resistance zones, particularly around $0.44, which has now become an important support level. $XLM price chart, July 15 (Source: TradingView) On the 4‑hour chart, we can see that the breakout above $0.40 was followed by strong momentum candles, confirmed by higher volume bars. After reaching a high near $0.4750, the market paused and formed a short‑term consolidation. Price pulled back to test support near $0.44 before buyers stepped in again, maintaining the series of higher lows. The 1‑hour footprint chart gives insight into recent order flow. Several candles show mixed deltas, with heavy buying and selling activity occurring simultaneously. For example, the 09:00 candle recorded a combined buy volume of 223.04K against sell orders of 243.35K, resulting in a delta of –20.31K, yet the price held steady. $XLM volume chart, July 15 (Source: TradingView This could indicate that selling pressure was absorbed without breaking the structure. The market appears to be absorbing selling pressure while maintaining structural integrity. At 11:00 UTC, a candle showed a -13.03K delta (159.91K buys vs 172.94K sells), yet the price held firmly above $0.45. This repeated pattern demonstrates consistent buyer support despite aggressive selling activity. $XLM currently trades at $0.4647, having rebounded from the $0.44 demand zone. The immediate resistance range of $0.4750-$0.48 represents a clear technical barrier where previous advances stalled. A volume-backed breakout above this zone could initiate a move toward $0.50 and potentially higher levels. Key support remains at $0.44, where sustained buying interest has preserved the bullish structure. The footprint chart reveals that buyers consistently absorb heavy sell flows, confirming the underlying strength in this uptrend. Investors should watch how the price reacts at the $0.4750-$0.48 resistance and $0.44 support levels, as these will be key to anticipating the next major move.

Stage 5 presale of MUTM is priced at $0.03. The phase has sold over 70%. Mutuum Finance has so far been able to raise more than $12.3 million and more than 13200 investors are currently on board. Still trading under $1, this DeFi token has the ingredients to explode by 30x before 2026, and early adopters are quietly stacking before the crowd catches on. If you’re wondering what to buy, this low-price powerhouse could be this summer’s breakout token, but only if you’re early. Dogecoin Update: Steady Momentum and Technical Developments Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently at a price of $0.197 having experienced a slight pull back after brushing with an intraday high of $0.213, and the current support seems to be steady at $0.20. More volume-based rallies caused DOGE to go up by approximately 8.6% and back down indicating that bigger owners might have been cashing in. The long-term outlooks are restrained and the mid‑term suggestions point at the prospective uptrend towards the $0.33-$0.55 by the end of 2025. With this progressive consolidation, Dogecoin is the current stalwart on the list of coins, with new applications in the field as well, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) being closely observed. Mutuum Finance Presale Gathers Rapid Momentum More than 13200 investors have joined the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale that has raised above $12.3 million. There is a lot of hype concerning the project and it is so evident that it is indeed a very positive evidence of the project being on the right track. MUTM tokens stand at $0.03 in phase 5 and will increase by 16.67% in phase 6. This stage has already passed over 70% of its sales as investors are keen to buy at the lowest possible price. The demand is growing exponentially and the fact that Mutuum Finance is a DeFi disruptor is even more precious considering the fact that it will be one of the best crypto investments of 2025. Mutuum’s $50K Bug Bounty Program with CertiK Security comes first for Mutuum Finance. In collaboration with CertiK, the platform has now launched its Bug Bounty Program officially with a combined reward pool amounting to $50,000 USDT. The program has four severity levels, critical, major, minor, and low, to ensure that any potential vulnerability would be found and rewarded appropriately. This is in support of the team’s commitment to building a secure, transparent, and high-quality DeFi protocol. $100K Giveaway Announced to Recognize Early Backers As a token of appreciation for its first community, Mutuum Finance has initiated a $100,000 giveaway campaign. Ten winners will be given $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. It is not only a gesture of appreciation but also an incentive to create a solid and active user base right from the start. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two standout altcoins under $1, but only one is showing the momentum to deliver 30x gains before 2026. While DOGE continues to trade steadily around $0.197 with modest upside projections, Mutuum Finance is breaking through presale milestones at an aggressive pace. Over $12.3 million raised, 13,200+ holders, and a Stage 5 price of just $0.03 paint a clear picture: investor confidence is surging. Security enhancements through a $50K CertiK-backed bug bounty and a $100K community giveaway further boost credibility. Demand is rising fast, and once the presale price increases by 16.67% in Phase 6, the window to get in early will start closing. Secure your MUTM tokens now and position yourself for what could be one of the top-performing altcoins of the next cycle.

A recent BofA report highlights a significant development: USD flows have turned neutral. This pivotal shift, occurring amidst escalating trade uncertainty , demands attention from all investors, including those deeply invested in digital assets. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for navigating the broader financial landscape. What Do Neutral USD Flows Signify? For a considerable period, the US Dollar has enjoyed a strong position, often acting as a safe haven currency during global economic turbulence. However, Bank of America’s recent analysis indicates a notable pivot. USD flows , which track the movement of capital into and out of dollar-denominated assets, have reached a point of neutrality. This means that the balance between buying and selling the US dollar is now roughly even. A Shift from Strength: Historically, periods of heightened global risk often saw an influx of capital into the dollar, boosting its value. The current neutrality suggests this trend is either pausing or reversing. Reduced Directional Conviction: Investors are no longer showing a strong collective conviction to either buy or sell the dollar aggressively. This could reflect a wait-and-see approach, or a lack of clear catalysts for further appreciation or depreciation. Implications for Other Assets: A neutral dollar can have varied impacts. It might reduce pressure on emerging market currencies, but also potentially remove a key tailwind for certain risk assets if the dollar’s safe-haven appeal diminishes without a clear alternative. The Shadow of Trade Uncertainty: A Persistent Concern? The backdrop to this shift in USD flows is a pervasive sense of trade uncertainty . Geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, and the ongoing re-evaluation of global trade alliances continue to cast a long shadow over economic forecasts. This uncertainty directly impacts corporate earnings, consumer confidence, and, critically, the stability of global financial markets. Consider these aspects of trade uncertainty: Tariff Threats and Trade Wars: The specter of new tariffs or escalating trade disputes between major economies can disrupt established supply chains, increase production costs, and reduce international trade volumes. Geopolitical Volatility: Conflicts and political instability in key regions can interrupt energy supplies, shipping routes, and overall market stability, leading to cautious investor behavior. Economic Decoupling: Efforts by nations to reduce reliance on specific trading partners or to reshore manufacturing can lead to significant structural changes in global trade, creating both challenges and new opportunities. This environment of uncertainty naturally makes investors more cautious, leading to a re-evaluation of traditional safe-haven assets like the dollar. Dissecting the BofA Report: Key Takeaways for Investors The recent BofA report offers a granular look into the factors driving this neutrality. Bank of America’s strategists analyze a wide range of data points, including institutional fund flows, corporate hedging activities, and cross-border investment trends, to arrive at their conclusions. Their findings suggest a complex interplay of forces at play. According to the report, the shift is not merely a short-term fluctuation but reflects deeper structural changes and cautious positioning by major players. For instance, the report might highlight: Reduced Foreign Demand for US Assets: A decline in net foreign purchases of US equities and bonds, signaling less capital flowing into the US. Corporate Hedging Strategies: Companies are adjusting their currency hedging strategies, perhaps reducing their long dollar positions as future revenues become less predictable due to trade frictions. Diverging Monetary Policies: While the Federal Reserve’s policy remains a key driver, other central banks’ actions are becoming more influential, potentially eroding the dollar’s interest rate advantage. This detailed analysis from the BofA report provides a critical lens through which to view the current market landscape, urging investors to remain agile and informed. Navigating Shifting Currency Market Trends The neutrality of USD flows is not an isolated event; it’s a significant indicator within broader currency market trends . When the dollar loses its clear directional bias, it opens the door for other major currencies to potentially gain strength or experience increased volatility. This can create a more dynamic and less predictable environment for global trade and investment. Here’s how this might play out across various currencies and markets: Currency/Market Potential Impact of Neutral USD Flows Euro (EUR) Could see increased demand if European economic data improves or if the ECB adopts a more hawkish stance, challenging the dollar’s dominance. Japanese Yen (JPY) May strengthen as a traditional safe-haven alternative, especially if global risks persist and the Bank of Japan shifts its ultra-loose policy. Emerging Market Currencies Might experience less pressure from a strong dollar, potentially allowing for greater capital inflows, but still vulnerable to local economic or political risks. Commodities Typically priced in USD, a neutral dollar could lead to more stable or even rising commodity prices, impacting inflation and production costs. These shifting currency market trends necessitate a more nuanced approach to international investments and hedging strategies. Investor Sentiment: From Risk-On to Caution? The move to neutral USD flows , coupled with persistent trade uncertainty , profoundly influences investor sentiment . The era of aggressive risk-taking, fueled by readily available liquidity and a clear global economic direction, appears to be giving way to a more cautious, wait-and-see approach. This shift can be observed across various asset classes. How does this evolving sentiment manifest? Flight to Quality (or Paralysis): While traditionally a strong dollar was a ‘flight to quality,’ neutral flows might indicate investors are either seeking other perceived safe havens (like gold or specific government bonds) or are simply holding cash due to indecision. Impact on Equities: Reduced conviction in the dollar can translate to greater volatility in equity markets, especially for multinational corporations whose earnings are sensitive to currency fluctuations. Cryptocurrency Implications: For the crypto market, often seen as a higher-risk asset class, this cautious sentiment could mean less speculative capital flowing in from traditional finance. However, it could also position certain digital assets as alternative hedges against traditional financial instability, depending on their perceived utility and decentralization. Focus on Fundamentals: Investors may increasingly scrutinize the underlying fundamentals of economies and companies rather than relying on broad currency trends for returns. Understanding this evolving investor sentiment is key to making informed decisions in a market that is increasingly complex and interconnected. Challenges and Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor The current landscape, marked by neutral USD flows and enduring trade uncertainty , presents both challenges and opportunities. The primary challenge lies in increased market unpredictability and the potential for sudden shifts in capital. Reduced liquidity in certain segments and difficulty in forecasting currency movements can complicate international business and investment strategies. However, for the astute investor, this environment also offers a chance to re-evaluate and optimize portfolios. Here are some actionable insights: Diversify Beyond Traditional Safe Havens: While the dollar has been a go-to, explore other diversification avenues. This could include a basket of major currencies, strategic allocations to gold, or even certain digital assets that demonstrate resilience. Re-evaluate Hedging Strategies: Businesses with international exposure should review their currency hedging mechanisms. Dynamic hedging strategies that can adapt to rapid changes in currency valuations may be more effective than static approaches. Focus on Strong Fundamentals: In times of uncertainty, companies and assets with robust balance sheets, strong cash flows, and clear competitive advantages tend to perform better. Conduct thorough due diligence. Monitor Geopolitical Developments Closely: Stay informed about trade negotiations, geopolitical tensions, and policy shifts, as these can trigger swift market reactions. Embrace Flexibility: The ability to adapt quickly to new information and adjust investment theses will be a significant advantage. Avoid rigid long-term positions that do not account for potential shifts. Conclusion The recent BofA report signaling neutral USD flows amidst pervasive trade uncertainty marks a critical juncture in global finance. This shift from a consistently strong dollar reflects a broader change in investor sentiment , moving from aggressive positioning to a more cautious stance. It underscores the profound impact of geopolitical and economic frictions on currency market trends and capital allocation. For investors across all asset classes, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, understanding these macro shifts is paramount. It’s a call to prudence, diversification, and a deep engagement with fundamental analysis. The market is signaling a period of re-evaluation, where adaptability and informed decision-making will be key to navigating the evolving landscape and seizing opportunities as they emerge.

Bitcoin Price Technical Analysis – Where is BTC Heading Next? Bitcoin (BTC) is holding strong near $117,000 after a powerful breakout, with momentum still favoring the bulls. If current support around $115,000 holds, BTC could be gearing up for another leg higher toward $123,000 and potentially $125,000 in the short term. The recent dip has helped reset the RSI from overbought levels, creating room for another push up. With bullish structure still intact and volume remaining elevated, Bitcoin looks primed for continuation. As long as the price stays within the current rising channel, the path of least resistance remains upward in what could be the start of a larger rally.

That Might Save DeFi,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/07/15/the-genius-act-killed-yield-bearing-stablecoins-that-might-save-defi,"Congress may pass the most consequential crypto law of the decade this week while drawing a bright red line through one of DeFi’s murkiest gray areas: yield-bearing stablecoins. At first glance, the GENIUS Act appears to be a straightforward regulatory win. It will finally grant over $120 billion in fiat-backed stablecoins a legal runway, establishing clear guardrails for what qualifies as a compliant payment stablecoin. But dig into the details and it becomes clear this isn’t a broad green light. In fact, under the law’s rigorous requirements—segregated reserves, high-quality liquid assets, GAAP attestations—only about 15% of today’s stablecoins would actually make the cut. More dramatically, the Act explicitly bans stablecoins from paying interest or yield. This is the first time U.S. lawmakers have drawn a hard line between stablecoins as payment instruments and stablecoins as yield-bearing assets. Overnight, it turns decades of crypto experimentation on its head, pushing DeFi to evolve or risk sliding back into the shadows. A hard stop for yield-bearing stablecoins For years, DeFi tried to have it both ways: offering “stable” assets that quietly generated returns, while dodging securities treatment. The GENIUS Act ends that ambiguity. Under the new law, any stablecoin paying yield, whether directly through staking mechanics or indirectly via pseudo-DeFi savings accounts, is now firmly outside the compliant perimeter. In short, yield-bearing stablecoins just got orphaned. Congress frames this as a way to protect U.S. banks. By banning stablecoin interest, lawmakers hope to prevent trillions from fleeing traditional deposits, which underwrite loans to small businesses and consumers. Keeping stablecoins yield-free preserves the basic plumbing of the U.S. credit system. But there’s a deeper shift underway. This is no longer just a compliance question. It’s a total rethink of collateral credibility at scale. Treasuries and monetary reflexivity Under GENIUS , all compliant stablecoins must be backed by cash and T-bills with maturities under 93 days. That effectively tilts crypto’s reserve strategy toward short-term U.S. fiscal instruments, integrating DeFi more deeply with American monetary policy than most people are ready to admit. We’re talking about a market currently around $28.7 trillion in outstanding marketable debt. Concurrently, the stablecoin market exceeds $250 billion in circulation. Therefore, even if just half of that (about $125 billion) pivots into short-term Treasuries, it represents a substantial shift, pushing crypto liquidity directly into U.S. debt markets. During normal times, that keeps the system humming. But in the event of a rate shock, those same flows could reverse violently, triggering liquidity crunches across lending protocols that use USDC or USDP as the so-called “risk-free leg.” It’s a new type of monetary reflexivity: DeFi now moves in sync with the health of the Treasury market. That’s both stabilizing and a fresh source of systemic risk. Why this could be the healthiest moment for DeFi Here’s the irony: by outlawing stablecoin yield, the GENIUS Act might actually steer DeFi in a more transparent, durable direction. Without the ability to embed yield directly into stablecoins, protocols are forced to build yield externally. That means using delta-neutral strategies, funding arbitrage, dynamically hedged staking, or open liquidity pools where risk and reward are auditable by anyone. It shifts the contest from “who can promise the highest APY?” to “who can build the smartest, most resilient risk engine?” It also draws new moats. Protocols that embrace smart compliance, through embedding AML rails, attestation layers, and token flow whitelists, will unlock this emerging capital corridor and tap institutional liquidity. Everyone else? Segregated on the other side of the regulatory fence, hoping shadow money markets can sustain them. Most founders underestimate how quickly crypto markets reprice regulatory risk. In traditional finance, policy shapes the cost of capital. In DeFi, it will now shape access to capital. Those who ignore these lines will watch partnerships stall, listings vanish, and exit liquidity evaporate as regulation quietly filters out who gets to stay in the game. The long view includes sharper lines, stronger systems The GENIUS Act isn’t the end of DeFi, but it does end a certain illusion that passive yield could simply be tacked onto stablecoins indefinitely, without transparency or trade-offs. From here on out, those yields have to come from somewhere real, with collateral, disclosures, and rigorous stress tests. That might be the healthiest pivot decentralized finance could make in its current state. Because if DeFi is ever going to complement, or even compete with, traditional financial systems, it can’t rely on blurred lines and regulatory gray zones. It has to prove exactly where the yield comes from, how it’s managed, and who bears the ultimate risk. The GENIUS Act just made this law. And in the long run, that could be one of the best things to ever happen to this industry.",Opinion|Opinion,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|MINING|FIAT|USDC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-15 17:39:32
48301872,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=178178,1752601204,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/48301872.jpeg,Aqua1 Foundation Unveils Truth Amidst Web3Port Rumors,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/aqua1-foundation-web3port-rumors/,"BitcoinWorld Aqua1 Foundation Unveils Truth Amidst Web3Port Rumors In the fast-paced and often speculative world of decentralized finance, clarity and trust are paramount. Recent whispers across social media platforms had cast a shadow of doubt over the operations of the Aqua1 Foundation , a significant player in the Web3 space. This prominent Web3 investment fund, known for its substantial $100 million commitment to World Liberty Financial (WLFI), recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to decisively address these swirling rumors, asserting its complete independence and denying any association with entities linked to misconduct. This crucial clarification aims to reinforce confidence and uphold the foundational principles of the decentralized ecosystem. Understanding the Aqua1 Foundation’s Stance on Web3Port The core of the recent speculation revolved around alleged ties between the Aqua1 Foundation and Web3Port, a Chinese market maker that has faced its own share of misconduct rumors. The Foundation’s official statement was unequivocal: it operates as an entirely independent entity, with no operational or structural connections to Web3Port or any other unrelated third parties. This direct denial serves to clear the air, particularly given the sensitive nature of the crypto market where even unsubstantiated rumors can significantly impact reputation and investor confidence. Why is such a denial so critical? In an ecosystem striving for decentralization and trustlessness, the integrity of investment funds is foundational. Any perceived link to entities embroiled in controversy can undermine the very trust that Web3 seeks to build. The Aqua1 Foundation emphasized its commitment to rigorous internal protocols and ethical practices, distinguishing itself from the shadowy corners of the market. This proactive communication strategy is a testament to their dedication to maintaining a pristine reputation within the digital asset landscape. The Imperative of Crypto Transparency in Web3 Investment The incident involving the Aqua1 Foundation underscores a broader, vital theme within the decentralized world: the absolute necessity of crypto transparency . In an environment where transactions are often pseudonymous and regulatory frameworks are still evolving, clear and open communication from major players is not just good practice—it’s essential for the health and growth of the entire ecosystem. Why Transparency Matters More Than Ever: Building Investor Confidence: Transparent operations reassure investors that their capital is being managed responsibly and ethically. Combating Misinformation: Proactive transparency can quickly debunk false narratives and rumors before they cause widespread damage. Fostering Trust in the Ecosystem: When key players are transparent, it elevates the credibility of the entire Web3 space, attracting more mainstream adoption. Ensuring Accountability: Clear operational guidelines and public statements hold organizations accountable for their actions and commitments. The Aqua1 Foundation ‘s swift response via X is a prime example of how Web3 entities can leverage direct communication channels to uphold transparency. By addressing speculation head-on, they set a precedent for accountability in a domain often criticized for its opacity. Navigating Misconduct Rumors and Protecting Digital Asset Investments The digital asset space, while innovative, is not immune to the challenges of misinformation and misconduct rumors. For investors, distinguishing fact from fiction can be daunting. The case of Web3Port , which has been linked to various allegations, highlights the risks associated with unverified information. The Aqua1 Foundation ‘s denial is a strong signal that they are not only aware of these risks but are actively working to protect their brand and, by extension, their investors from association with questionable practices. Key Considerations for Safeguarding Your Digital Asset Investments: Aspect Description Due Diligence Thoroughly research any fund or project before investing. Look for verifiable information on their team, track record, and operational transparency. Official Channels Always refer to official statements from organizations, typically on their websites or verified social media accounts, rather than relying on unverified forum posts or anonymous sources. Regulatory Compliance While Web3 is global, understand the regulatory environment in which a fund operates. Funds adhering to some form of compliance often demonstrate a higher level of accountability. Community Sentiment vs. Facts Be aware of community sentiment, but always cross-reference it with factual, verifiable information. Rumors can spread rapidly. The commitment of the Aqua1 Foundation to legal action if necessary further reinforces their serious approach to safeguarding their reputation and the integrity of their digital asset portfolio. This stance sends a clear message to those who might spread malicious or unfounded claims, highlighting the professional standards expected within the Web3 investment landscape. The Broader Context: Aqua1’s Significant Web3 Investment Beyond the immediate denial, it’s worth recalling the scale of the Aqua1 Foundation ‘s activities. Their $100 million investment into World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a firm that has garnered attention due to its reported ties to former President Trump, positions Aqua1 as a significant player. This substantial Web3 investment demonstrates their confidence in the potential of certain ventures within the digital economy. While the political associations of WLFI might draw headlines, the Aqua1 Foundation ‘s recent statement redirects the focus squarely onto its operational independence and its commitment to ethical investment practices within the Web3 space. It underscores that their investment decisions are based on their own internal assessments and strategic objectives, rather than being influenced by or tied to other external, potentially controversial, entities like Web3Port . Actionable Insights for the Web3 Community What can the broader Web3 community, from individual investors to other funds and projects, learn from this situation? The Aqua1 Foundation’s response offers several key takeaways: Proactive Communication is Key: Don’t let rumors fester. Address them swiftly and directly through official channels. Reinforce Core Values: Use such opportunities to reiterate commitment to principles like crypto transparency and integrity. Maintain Independence: For investment funds, clearly delineating operational boundaries from other entities, especially those facing scrutiny, is crucial for maintaining trust. Embrace Accountability: Be prepared to back up statements with actions, including legal recourse if necessary, to protect reputation and assets. Educate the Community: Help users understand how to discern reliable information from speculation, fostering a more informed and resilient ecosystem for digital asset management. This incident serves as a timely reminder that while Web3 offers unprecedented opportunities, it also demands heightened vigilance and a collective commitment to ethical conduct and clear communication from all participants. Conclusion: Upholding Integrity in a Dynamic Web3 Landscape The Aqua1 Foundation ‘s decisive denial of ties to Web3Port is more than just a public relations exercise; it is a critical affirmation of its commitment to independent operation and ethical conduct within the volatile Web3 investment landscape. By swiftly addressing speculation and emphasizing its dedication to crypto transparency , the Foundation reinforces the vital role that clear communication and integrity play in building and maintaining trust in the decentralized finance space. For investors and the broader community, this event highlights the ongoing need for due diligence and reliance on official sources, ensuring that the promising future of digital asset innovation is built on a foundation of trust and accountability.

But as the market evolves, a new blockchain player is making significant waves. Ruvi AI (RUVI), a cutting-edge project combining artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology, is quickly drawing the attention of Ripple holders. With its proven security measures, utility-driven ambitions, and early-stage growth potential, Ruvi AI promises massive returns for early investors. Here’s why Ruvi AI is inspiring confidence in Ripple holders and how its potential could turn a well-timed $2,000 investment into six-figure gains. Security and Transparency Backed by Audit One of the reasons Ruvi AI is attracting Ripple enthusiasts is its emphasis on trust, safety, and transparency. Early investors often shy away from new tokens due to risks associated with unvetted projects, but Ruvi AI eliminates this concern. The project successfully completed a rigorous third-party audit by CyberScope, a leading blockchain security firm. This audit verified that Ruvi AI’s smart contracts are both scalable and free from vulnerabilities, ensuring long-term safety for its community. Adding to its credibility, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange, a globally trusted trading platform. This partnership guarantees post-presale liquidity, enabling a seamless exchange of tokens as soon as Ruvi AI launches for public trading. Both the audit and the exchange partnership demonstrate Ruvi AI’s commitment to creating a secure and reliable ecosystem for investors. A Presale With Numbers That Impress Ruvi AI’s presale phase is a testament to its growing momentum. Early investors have already poured over $2.3 million into the project. Meanwhile, more than 185 million tokens have been sold to a community of 2,200 holders. These figures reflect not just strong demand but also the project’s ability to inspire confidence across a diverse range of investors. Currently priced at $0.015 per token in Phase 2, Ruvi AI remains an accessible gateway into potentially life-changing returns. By the end of the presale, token prices will rise to $0.07, allowing an almost 5x ROI before public trading even begins. Analysts predict that Ruvi AI could achieve a valuation of $1 per token post-listing, equating to an extraordinary 66x ROI for Phase 2 participants. Such projections make Ruvi AI one of the most compelling opportunities in the cryptocurrency space, particularly for Ripple investors who understand the value of supporting a utility-driven platform. Real-World Utility That Drives Demand What sets Ruvi AI apart from speculative tokens is its focus on real-world applications. By integrating AI into the blockchain, Ruvi AI provides innovative solutions across marketing, entertainment, and finance, ensuring sustained demand for its token. Revolutionizing Marketing Businesses today thrive on data-driven decision-making, and Ruvi AI delivers AI-powered marketing tools to optimize advertising strategies. These tools improve audience targeting, enhance campaign efficiency, and maximize ROI for businesses, making Ruvi AI an invaluable partner to brands worldwide. Empowering Creators in Digital Entertainment Ruvi AI also caters to the growing creator economy by introducing blockchain-secured payment platforms. These systems ensure instant and transparent payouts for creators, eliminating common revenue delays. Additionally, Ruvi AI’s AI-driven insights help creators build stronger engagement and expand their reach. Innovating Financial Transactions The inefficiencies of traditional financial markets, high fees, slow processing times, and fraud risks, are no match for Ruvi AI. The platform’s low-cost cross-border payment solutions and fraud-proof transaction systems offer a revolutionary alternative for businesses and individuals alike. These practical, scalable applications solidify Ruvi AI’s position as a next-generation leader, attracting investors who value long-term utility over fleeting hype. Generous VIP Investment Tiers Ruvi AI further motivates early participation by offering a VIP investment program that maximizes token bonuses. Below are some examples of how this structure works: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. Low entry prices paired with these generous bonuses provide an incredible opportunity for both small-scale and institutional investors to secure significant returns.

Fresh off reported significant losses in June, Wynn has once again captivated the crypto community by opening an astonishing $18.43 million Bitcoin leveraged trading position . This audacious move, executed on the decentralized perpetual exchange Hyperliquid, involves a staggering 40x leverage on Bitcoin (BTC). What drives such a high-stakes gamble, and what can we learn from a trader who consistently embraces extreme risk? Let’s dive deep into the details of this latest bold maneuver and explore the intricate dynamics of leveraged trading in the digital asset space. Unpacking James Wynn’s Audacious Bitcoin Leveraged Trading Bet The crypto market is no stranger to dramatic entries and exits, but James Wynn’s latest move stands out. According to on-chain tracker Onchain Lens on X, Wynn deposited a substantial $467,999 into Hyperliquid, a decentralized platform, to initiate this massive long position. With 40x leverage, this relatively modest initial capital controls a Bitcoin position worth $18.43 million. For those unfamiliar, Bitcoin leveraged trading amplifies both potential gains and losses. A 40x leverage means that for every 1% price movement in Bitcoin, the position’s value changes by 40%. While this can lead to exponential profits if the market moves favorably, it also means a small adverse price movement can quickly liquidate the entire position. Wynn’s strategy isn’t new; he’s known for his aggressive, high-risk approach. This isn’t his first foray into highly leveraged plays, nor is it his first time in the spotlight for significant financial outcomes, both positive and negative. His reported $100 million loss in June serves as a stark reminder of the inherent volatility and unforgiving nature of such strategies. Yet, here he is again, doubling down with one of the most significant individual leveraged positions observed recently. The High-Stakes World of Crypto High Risk Strategies Why do traders like James Wynn engage in such crypto high risk strategies? The allure is simple: the potential for immense profits in a short timeframe. However, the reality is far more complex and often brutal. High leverage acts as a double-edged sword. It allows traders with limited capital to control large positions, maximizing their exposure to market movements. But this amplification works both ways. Liquidation Risk: At 40x leverage, even a minor price drop of 2.5% against the long position could wipe out the initial margin. This is known as liquidation, where the exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, are notorious for their price swings. These rapid fluctuations make high-leverage positions incredibly precarious. Emotional Toll: The pressure of managing such large, volatile positions can be immense, leading to impulsive decisions that further exacerbate losses. Wynn’s previous reported losses underscore the critical importance of risk management, even for seasoned traders. While his aggressive style might seem reckless to some, it highlights a segment of the crypto trading community that thrives on these extreme scenarios, seeking to capitalize on every market tremor. Why Hyperliquid Exchange for Such a Massive Position? The choice of platform for such a significant trade is also noteworthy. James Wynn opted for Hyperliquid exchange , a decentralized perpetual exchange. This choice reflects a growing trend among experienced crypto traders towards decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms for their trading activities. What makes Hyperliquid an attractive venue for a trade of this magnitude? Decentralization: Unlike centralized exchanges (CEXs) that hold user funds and control order books, Hyperliquid operates on a decentralized model. This means users retain custody of their assets, reducing counterparty risk. Transparency: Transactions on decentralized exchanges are recorded on a public blockchain, offering a high degree of transparency. This is how on-chain trackers like Onchain Lens can identify and report on such large positions. Liquidity and Fees: DeFi perpetuals have matured, offering competitive liquidity and often lower fees compared to some centralized counterparts, especially for high-volume traders. Permissionless Access: Decentralized platforms typically offer permissionless access, meaning anyone with an internet connection and a crypto wallet can participate, without extensive KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures often required by CEXs. Wynn’s decision to use Hyperliquid reinforces the platform’s reputation as a serious contender for professional traders seeking robust and transparent decentralized trading environments, even for high-leverage plays. Decoding the On-Chain Analysis Behind the Bet The public nature of blockchain transactions is a defining characteristic of the crypto space, enabling detailed on-chain analysis . In Wynn’s case, it was precisely this transparency that allowed Onchain Lens to identify and report on his $467,999 deposit and subsequent 40x leveraged Bitcoin long. On-chain data provides an unprecedented level of insight into market activity, often revealing the moves of large players, or “whales,” before they become widely known. For analysts, tracking such movements can offer clues about market sentiment and potential future price action. When a well-known trader, especially one with a history like Wynn’s, takes such a large position, it inevitably sparks discussion and speculation. While not a guarantee of success, observing these high-profile trades can provide a fascinating look into the conviction (or speculative nature) of market participants. However, it’s crucial to remember that on-chain data alone doesn’t tell the whole story. The reasons behind a trade, the trader’s overall portfolio, and their risk management strategies (if any) remain largely private. What we see is merely the transaction itself, open for public interpretation. What Does This Mean for James Wynn Crypto’s Future? James Wynn’s consistent presence in the headlines, whether for massive gains or significant losses, positions him as a fascinating figure in the crypto landscape. His latest James Wynn crypto maneuver raises questions about his long-term strategy and resilience. Is this a calculated risk based on deep market conviction, or another chapter in a series of high-stakes gambles? For the broader crypto community, Wynn’s actions serve as a powerful case study: The Power of Leverage: It demonstrates the incredible capital efficiency leverage offers, allowing small sums to control vast positions. The Perils of Leverage: Simultaneously, it highlights the extreme fragility of such positions and the potential for rapid capital erosion. The Role of On-Chain Data: It showcases how transparent blockchain data empowers a new generation of market observers and analysts. Ultimately, the outcome of Wynn’s $18.43 million Bitcoin long position remains to be seen. It will undoubtedly be closely watched by many, serving as a real-time example of the exhilarating highs and devastating lows that define the world of high-leverage cryptocurrency trading. While such strategies are not for everyone, understanding them is key to comprehending the full spectrum of activities within the dynamic crypto market. Conclusion: The Unfolding Drama of High-Stakes Crypto Trading James Wynn’s $18.43 million 40x leveraged Bitcoin long position on Hyperliquid is more than just a trade; it’s a testament to the audacious spirit and inherent risks that define the cryptocurrency market. From his reported past losses to his current high-stakes gamble, Wynn embodies the relentless pursuit of alpha that characterizes a segment of crypto traders. This move not only puts his capital on the line but also shines a spotlight on the capabilities of decentralized exchanges and the invaluable insights offered by on-chain analysis. As the crypto world watches, this position serves as a potent reminder that while opportunities for significant gains exist, they often come hand-in-hand with equally significant risks. It’s a thrilling, perilous dance on the edge of market volatility, where fortunes can be made or lost in the blink of an eye.

We'll see what happens,” Cohen said on CNBC's Squawk Box. GameStop invested more than half a billion dollars in late May by purchasing 4,710 Bitcoin. This move came just before Bitcoin reached all-time highs of over $120,000.

Even Jamie Dimon, the longtime crypto critic and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, says the bank is getting involved, whether he understands the point of it or not. Speaking Tuesday during the company’s earnings call, Dimon said plainly, “I think they’re real, but I don’t know why you’d want to [use a] stablecoin as opposed to just payment.” He’s not wrong about his confusion. Dimon, now 69, has built his brand on skepticism of bitcoin and most things crypto. But when you’re running the largest U.S. bank, which moves nearly $10 trillion every single day, you don’t get the luxury of ignoring new rails just because they don’t fit into your worldview. Especially not when fintech players are coming hard for your turf. JPMorgan and others test stablecoin products Stablecoins, for those who need the reminder, are digital tokens pegged to fiat currencies—most often the U.S. dollar. They’re supposed to stay steady in value and act like cash that moves faster, settles instantly, and costs less. They’re not speculative coins like Bitcoin; they’re more like upgraded wire transfers that don’t take three days to clear. Last month, JPMorgan revealed it’s already rolling out a limited version of its own coin—called a deposit coin—but it’s only for the bank’s private clients. This isn’t a full-blown public stablecoin yet. But it’s a step into the water. “We’re going to be involved in both JPMorgan deposit coin and stablecoins to understand it, to be good at it,” Dimon said. He’s not the only one dipping a toe. On the same day as JPMorgan’s call, Citigroup executives said the bank is “looking at the issuance of a Citi stablecoin.” They’re not just stopping there. Citi says the real opportunity lies in tokenized deposits and crypto custody services—two areas where legacy banks have serious muscle to flex if they stop dragging their feet. And over at Bank of America, CEO Brian Moynihan is also making it clear: the bank will engage with stablecoins. No rollout yet, but the signal is loud enough. When this many top dogs start circling the same space at the same time, it’s never a coincidence. Big banks watch fintech and prep for team-ups What’s pushing these banks off the bench isn’t enthusiasm—it’s fear of falling behind. Dimon said Tuesday, “These guys are very smart,” when asked about fintech rivals. “They’re trying to figure out a way to create bank accounts, to get into payment systems and rewards programs, and we have to be cognizant of that.” In other words, the enemy’s not waiting. These fintech companies are already offering services that traditional banks used to own. They’re fast, they’re global, and they don’t have to deal with 1970s tech like ACH and SWIFT. That alone makes stablecoins a real threat if the banks don’t evolve. Dimon gets that. He didn’t say it outright, but the move toward stablecoin infrastructure now is a play to stay relevant while rules around digital currencies start getting clearer. Regulation is finally catching up. Banks have the lawyers and capital to dominate once they commit—and now they’re starting to. There’s also talk of banks joining forces. One route could be to push through Early Warning Services, a firm owned by a group of banks that already gave us Zelle. That instant payments network was the banks’ answer to PayPal and Cash App. A joint stablecoin effort could play out the same way, helping them fight off Silicon Valley’s attempts to eat their lunch. But Dimon wasn’t giving any details. When asked about a possible collaboration between banks on stablecoins, he said, “That’s a great question, and we’ll leave it remaining as a question.” So yeah, it’s being discussed. Just don’t expect a roadmap yet. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

The crypto world is buzzing with a fascinating development: Bitcoin price analysis reveals that short-term holders (STHs) have reached a significant milestone, pushing their average buying price above $100,000. This isn’t just a number; it’s a potential game-changer, hinting at a robust new Bitcoin support level that could redefine future market dynamics for the world’s leading digital asset. This breakthrough, reported by Cointelegraph citing Glassnode data, signals a maturing market and potentially stronger foundational support for BTC. Who are BTC Short-Term Holders and Why Does Their Behavior Matter? Before diving into the significance of the $100,000 mark, it’s crucial to understand who BTC short-term holders (STHs) are and why their collective behavior offers such profound insights into Bitcoin price analysis . In the realm of on-chain analytics, STHs are typically defined as Bitcoin addresses that have held their coins for less than 155 days. These participants are often more reactive to market volatility compared to long-term holders (LTHs), who tend to HODL through cycles. Market Sensitivity: STHs are generally more sensitive to price fluctuations, making them key drivers of immediate market sentiment and short-term price movements. Their buying and selling activity can significantly influence market momentum. Cost Basis as a Barometer: The average buying price, or ‘cost basis,’ of STHs acts as a powerful indicator. When the price falls below their average cost, STHs are typically ‘underwater,’ increasing the likelihood of selling pressure as they seek to minimize losses or break even. Conversely, when the price is significantly above their cost basis, they might realize profits. Liquidity Providers: STHs often represent the more speculative and liquid segment of the market, frequently entering and exiting positions. Their movements can signal shifts in supply and demand dynamics. Understanding their aggregated cost basis provides a unique lens into where significant amounts of capital have recently entered the market, which can then act as a psychological and technical level of interest for future price action. The Pivotal $100,000 Mark: A New Bitcoin Support Level in the Making? The news that the average buying price of BTC short-term holders has crossed above $100,000 is not merely a statistical anomaly; it represents a profound shift in market structure. According to Glassnode data, this means that, on average, recent buyers of Bitcoin have acquired their holdings at a price point that has now surpassed the six-figure mark. Why is this so important? Historically, an aggregate cost basis for a significant cohort of market participants often transforms into a psychological and technical Bitcoin support level . Here’s why this $100,000 threshold is being eyed as a potential bulwark against future corrections: Psychological Anchor: For many recent buyers, $100,000 represents their breakeven point. If the price were to dip towards this level, these holders might be less inclined to sell, or even be motivated to buy more to average down, creating buying pressure. Realized Price Indicator: The STH cost basis is a form of ‘realized price’ for this specific group, reflecting the aggregate price at which coins last moved on-chain. When the market price trades above this realized price, it often signals a healthy, profitable market for recent participants. Historical Precedent: In past market cycles, the STH cost basis has frequently acted as a reliable support during pullbacks. When the price dips to or slightly below this level, it often finds a floor before resuming an upward trajectory. This pattern suggests a strong conviction among these newer market entrants. This development suggests a robust belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition among those who have entered the market more recently. It implies that a substantial amount of capital is now ‘locked in’ at or above this $100,000 level, potentially providing a strong foundation for future growth. How Does Glassnode Data Illuminate Crypto Market Trends ? The insights we’re discussing, particularly regarding BTC short-term holders ‘ cost basis, come courtesy of Glassnode, a leading on-chain analytics platform. But what exactly is on-chain data, and how does it help us understand broader crypto market trends ? Glassnode specializes in transforming raw blockchain data into actionable intelligence. Unlike traditional financial markets where much of the data is proprietary or requires significant aggregation, every Bitcoin transaction is recorded on a public, immutable ledger. Glassnode’s sophisticated algorithms process this vast amount of information to derive meaningful metrics, offering transparency into market behavior that is unparalleled in traditional finance. Key ways Glassnode data illuminates market trends include: Supply Dynamics: Tracking the distribution of coins, active supply, and illiquid supply helps identify whether more coins are being held for the long term or are readily available for trading. Holder Behavior: Differentiating between short-term and long-term holders, analyzing their spending patterns, and tracking their profitability provides insights into market sentiment and potential selling pressure or accumulation. Miner Activity: Monitoring miner revenues, hash rate, and spending behavior can signal miner capitulation or confidence, impacting market supply. Exchange Flows: Tracking Bitcoin inflows and outflows from exchanges can indicate whether investors are moving coins off-exchange for cold storage (bullish) or onto exchanges for selling (bearish). The STH cost basis is just one powerful example of how Glassnode data provides a unique, fundamental perspective on Bitcoin’s market health, moving beyond mere price charts to reveal the underlying investor psychology and capital flows that drive Bitcoin price analysis . Decoding Bitcoin Market Cycles : What Can We Learn from History? The current observation about BTC short-term holders and the $100,000 threshold isn’t isolated; it fits within the larger narrative of Bitcoin market cycles . Bitcoin’s history is characterized by distinct bull and bear markets, often influenced by halving events and broader macroeconomic factors. Understanding how different holder cohorts behave during these cycles is crucial for predicting future movements. Let’s consider some historical patterns: During previous bull markets, as Bitcoin’s price ascended, the average cost basis of STHs would typically rise. When corrections occurred, this rising STH cost basis often acted as dynamic support. For example: In the 2017 bull run, dips to the STH cost basis often presented strong buying opportunities before the next leg up. Similarly, during the 2021 bull market, the STH realized price provided a floor during significant corrections, demonstrating strong conviction from new market entrants. Conversely, during bear markets, when the price falls significantly below the STH cost basis, these holders often capitulate, leading to increased selling pressure and further price depreciation. The point where the market price falls below the STH cost basis and stays there can signal the onset of a bear market, and the re-crossing above it can signal recovery. The fact that the STH cost basis is now at $100,000 in the current environment suggests a high level of confidence and capital inflow at these elevated prices. It implies that recent buyers are not just chasing fleeting pumps but are investing with a strong conviction, potentially indicating a robust phase within the ongoing Bitcoin market cycles . Actionable Insights for Investors: Navigating the Current Landscape So, what does this significant development mean for you as an investor or enthusiast? The establishment of a potential $100,000 Bitcoin support level by BTC short-term holders offers several actionable insights for navigating the current crypto market trends . For Long-Term Holders (HODLers): Confirmation of Strength: This data reinforces the idea that significant capital is entering and staying in Bitcoin at higher price points, validating the long-term bullish outlook. Accumulation Opportunities: Should Bitcoin experience pullbacks towards the $100,000 level, it might present a compelling accumulation zone, assuming the historical behavior of STH cost basis acting as support holds true. Reduced Volatility Expectations: While Bitcoin remains volatile, a strong underlying support level can potentially mitigate the severity of future downturns, offering some peace of mind. For Traders and Short-Term Participants: Key Reference Point: Use the $100,000 STH cost basis as a critical technical level for setting stop-losses or identifying potential bounce zones during corrections. Sentiment Indicator: Monitor whether the market price consistently holds above this level. A sustained break below could signal weakening sentiment among recent buyers and potential further downside. Risk Management: Always prioritize robust risk management strategies. While on-chain data provides powerful insights, market dynamics can change rapidly due to unforeseen events. General Advice: Stay Informed: Continue to monitor on-chain metrics from sources like Glassnode. These insights provide a deeper understanding beyond simple price charts. Diversify: While Bitcoin is a foundational asset, a diversified portfolio can help manage risk across different crypto market trends . Long-Term Vision: Remember that Bitcoin market cycles are often long, and short-term fluctuations should be viewed within that broader context. This data point doesn’t guarantee a smooth ride, but it does provide a powerful indicator of underlying market strength and conviction among a crucial segment of Bitcoin investors. What Challenges Could Impact This Crucial Support? While the $100,000 average buying price for BTC short-term holders presents a compelling argument for a strong Bitcoin support level , it’s essential to acknowledge that no support is absolute. Several factors could challenge or even invalidate this crucial threshold, influencing future Bitcoin price analysis and broader crypto market trends . Potential challenges include: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Significant shifts in global economic conditions, such as unexpected interest rate hikes, a severe recession, or geopolitical instability, could trigger a broad risk-off sentiment, leading investors to divest from risk assets like Bitcoin, regardless of on-chain fundamentals. Black Swan Events: Unforeseen events, whether regulatory crackdowns, major exchange hacks, or technological vulnerabilities, could cause a sudden and severe market downturn, overwhelming any established support levels. Significant Profit-Taking by Long-Term Holders: While STHs are reactive, long-term holders (LTHs) might decide to realize substantial profits accumulated over years, leading to a supply shock that could temporarily depress prices below STH cost basis. Regulatory Uncertainty: Evolving regulatory landscapes in major economies could introduce uncertainty or restrictions, impacting investor confidence and capital flows into the crypto market. Whale Movements: Large institutional or individual holders (whales) can execute trades significant enough to move the market independently of aggregate STH behavior. Their coordinated selling could exert immense downward pressure. Therefore, while the $100,000 STH cost basis is a powerful indicator, it should be viewed as one piece of a larger puzzle. Investors should continuously monitor a range of on-chain metrics, macroeconomic indicators, and news developments to form a holistic view of Bitcoin’s potential trajectory. The ascent of the average buying price of BTC short-term holders above $100,000 marks a significant milestone in Bitcoin’s journey. This robust data point, courtesy of Glassnode, strongly suggests the formation of a critical Bitcoin support level at this six-figure threshold. It reflects the increasing conviction and substantial capital inflows from recent market participants, signaling a potential new floor for the flagship cryptocurrency. As we navigate the ever-evolving crypto market trends , understanding the nuances of Bitcoin market cycles and the behavior of different holder cohorts becomes paramount. While challenges persist, this development offers a compelling narrative of Bitcoin’s growing maturity and resilience, providing valuable insights for investors seeking to make informed decisions in this dynamic landscape.

XRP and Bitcoin: A High-Beta Relationship Weisberger’s comments stem from a broader observation about market behavior. In his words, “What matters is XRP is beta to Bitcoin.” By describing XRP as having a high beta to BTC, he means that XRP tends to mimic Bitcoin’s movements , often in a magnified way. When Bitcoin rises, XRP usually follows, and sometimes outpaces it. When Bitcoin stalls or corrects, XRP typically responds in kind, sometimes with more dramatic swings. “Bitcoin’s gone up,” Weisberger noted. “And guess what? XRP has done exactly what I said it would do… It’s gone up more when Bitcoin plateaus. His remarks reinforce the idea that XRP’s market performance, while influenced by its fundamentals, remains largely tethered to Bitcoin’s macro trends. :Dave Weisberger says it loud: ""XRP is beta to Bitcoin!"" BTC goes up, XRP follows… but this time, XRP might lead. It’s doing EXACTLY what was predicted. LET’S GOOO! #XRP #Bitcoin #CryptoNews pic.twitter.com/9uUUghyLFr — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) July 14, 2025 Legal Battles Are Not the Driving Force Weisberger also challenged a popular narrative in the XRP space, that legal outcomes, especially Ripple’s ongoing battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), are the primary catalyst for price movements. Dismissing this idea, he recalled a recent interview: “They were asking about XRP’s price. They were talking about the court case. I said, ‘The court cases don’t mean shit.’” This bold claim underscores Weisberger’s view that while regulatory clarity may shape XRP’s long-term use case, it is Bitcoin’s price action that truly moves the needle in the short to medium term. XRP’s Recent Price Action Validates the Thesis The current market supports Weisberger’s thesis. As Bitcoin surged past $110,000, XRP reclaimed the $3 mark. The rally has fueled speculation among investors that XRP could be poised for an even greater breakout, especially if Bitcoin continues its bullish trend. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This behavior aligns with the beta principle: XRP lags slightly behind BTC during the early phases of a move, but once momentum builds, it often accelerates with greater force. For traders, this makes XRP a high-risk, high-reward asset in bull markets, and a dangerous one during corrections. Could XRP Eventually Lead? Interestingly, a growing segment of the XRP community believes the dynamic may be shifting. With Ripple expanding its cross-border payment solutions globally and XRP gaining traction in real-world financial systems, some argue that XRP could soon decouple from Bitcoin and pave its path. However, Weisberger remains pragmatic. For now, his analysis is clear, data-driven, and seemingly accurate: XRP’s market behavior continues to reflect Bitcoin’s larger moves. Xaif’s post has since gone viral, sparking widespread discussion across social media and further cementing Weisberger’s place as a critical voice in understanding XRP’s market dynamics. Whether XRP remains beta to Bitcoin or eventually becomes a market leader in its own right, the current cycle is once again proving that Weisberger’s insights can’t be ignored.

The analyst noted that ADA might be repeating, with market conditions mirroring the ones that led to an all-time high (ATH). Cardano Prices Eyes 285% Rally To New Highs In a TradingView post, Scrambler predicted that the Cardano price could soon record a 285% rally to reach $2.05. He noted that the 285% potential move mirrors ADA’s past rally from similar conditions. The analyst added that if market sentiment continues improving and the Bitcoin price holds above key levels, then the altcoin might repeat history. Related Reading: Cardano Price Shows Seller Exhaustion Above $0.57 — Bullish Divergence Signals Rally Further commenting on the Cardano price action, Scrambler stated that ADA is showing a major breakout from a long-standing descending channel on the daily timeframe. He highlighted the structure, alluding to a downtrend channel that has been respected for around seven months. He also noted that a breakout has been confirmed with a strong bullish daily candle. Meanwhile, price is hovering around $0.7192, above previous resistance. Scrambler stated that the support levels for the Cardano price are $0.60 and $0.5299. The resistance and long-term targets are $0.8158, $1.0876, $1.3159, and $1.8958. Meanwhile, the ultimate target is the Fibonacci extension above $2.76. The analyst stated that a pullback to between $0.60 and $0.66 could offer re-entry opportunities. Regardless of what happens to the Cardano price in the short term, Scrambler remains bullish in the long term and expects ADA to reach new highs. The analyst also advised market participants to watch for the BTC/ETH correlation. It is worth noting that ADA has shown impressive strength amid this recent crypto market rally. The altcoin has risen by over 25% in the last seven days, despite a recent pullback. ADA To Breakout Against Its BTC Pair In an X post, crypto analyst Sebastian stated that the ADA/BTC chart appears to be ready for a breakout. The analyst added that this is the most important breakout that market participants want to see, with the Cardano price separating itself from the Bitcoin price. Once that happens, the altcoin is likely to outperform the flagship crypto during that period. Related Reading: Cardano Founder Announces $100 Million Bitcoin Buy In Shocking Move To Prop Up ADA Price Sebastian had earlier noted how Bitcoin’s dominance could be breaking down. Based on this, he remarked that alcoins like Cardano are about to rally if this happens. A break in Bitcoin’s dominance could usher in altcoin season, which is bullish for the Cardano price. In the meantime, ADA’s performance still hinges on BTC’s performance. At the time of writing, the Cardano price is trading at around $0.72, down almost 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Although digital assets still represent just 1% of BlackRock’s $12.5 trillion in total AUM, the category is emerging as one of its fastest-growing product lines. Digital assets contributed hugely to BlackRock’s broader ETF performance. Within the firm’s $85 billion in total ETF inflows during Q2, digital products alone accounted for $14 billion. Year-to-date, digital asset net inflows have reached $17 billion, showing persistent institutional interest despite a complex macroeconomic backdrop. Revenue Contribution Remains Modest—For Now Digital assets generated $40 million in base fees and securities lending revenue in Q2 2025, also accounting for 1% of BlackRock’s total revenue from investment advisory and administration services. While modest compared to traditional asset classes, the figure reflects a growing stream of yield-generating exposure from crypto-related products . CEO Larry Fink attributed some of the firm’s performance momentum to digital assets, along with custom strategies and technology-led platforms like Aperio. BlackRock Shows Long-Term Commitment to Digital Finance In a statement accompanying the results, CEO Larry Fink emphasized the growing role of digital assets in attracting a new generation of investors. “We’re attracting a new and increasingly global generation of investors through things like our digital assets offerings,” he said. Digital assets are currently reported under the ETF category, alongside core equity and fixed income. However, with digital assets contributing nearly 31% of alternative product flows in Q2, they are becoming a key pillar of the firm’s alternative investment strategy. While digital assets remain a small slice of the overall portfolio, BlackRock’s growing involvement in tokenized finance, ETFs, and related infrastructure suggests a long-term commitment to institutional crypto adoption. “These are just the early days in our next phase of even stronger growth,” Fink added. BlackRock Shares Tumble BlackRock shares fell more than 6% after a major institutional client based in Asia withdrew $52 billion from its index funds during the second quarter, the Wall Street Journal reported. The withdrawal illustrates the volatility that even the world’s largest asset manager can face from a small number of large clients, particularly in passive investment vehicles. Still, BlackRock’s overall performance remained strong, with total assets under management climbing to a record $12.53 trillion. According to the WSJ , net income rose 6.5% year-over-year to $1.59 billion, indicating operational resilience in the face of short-term outflows. The firm also reported increased revenue driven by higher base fees and strong flows into active strategies and ETFs, suggesting that BlackRock continues to diversify its growth drivers beyond traditional index products.

Van de Poppe tells his 795,100 followers on the social media platform X that after Bitcoin ( BTC ) printed new all-time highs and Ethereum ( ETH ) surged into the $3,000 range, the digital assets will likely start trending lower based on historical precedent. “Classic move on the markets here. Likely we’re going to be seeing some more downside on Bitcoin and Ethereum to squeeze out the longs. Remember: volatility goes up, price goes up. This means harsh corrections are around the corner.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests ETH may decline to the $2,750 level before a trend reversal. Bitcoin is trading for $116,947 at time of writing, down 5% from its all-time high of $122,838 on Monday. Meanwhile, Ethereum is trading for $3,048 at time of writing, up 19% in the last week. Next up, the analyst says that layer-1 blockchain SUI Network ( SUI ) is showing strong market fundamentals after regaining the $3 level, and he believes the digital asset has more upside potential. “Strongest ecosystems bounce back the strongest when a market is reversing. SUI is one of them. Did held strong support at $2.35 and started to rally substantially as it broke the downtrend. Crucial breakout above $3, and it’s basically into ‘buy the dip’ territory as it will be trading upwards.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X SUI is trading for $4.01 at time of writing, up 2.4% in the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin recently reached a new high above $117,000, while altcoins are experiencing multiple-figure gains, accompanied by tremendous community buzz. But with thousands of tokens competing for attention, which ones truly deserve a place in your portfolio this month? Here’s a quick look at the top 5 tokens to watch in July 2025, each offering a unique narrative and growth potential: Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) : The meme coin rewriting the playbook with real Layer 2 utility. Aptos (APT): Driving real-world asset (RWA) adoption with unstoppable ecosystem growth. Sui (SUI): Massive DeFi surge, strong recovery momentum, and a battle-tested tech edge. Ripple (XRP): Major breakout with ETFs looming, 6.6M+ holders backing the next run. Hedera (HBAR): Explosive network activity and bullish patterns signaling a potential 150% rally. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE): The Meme Coin With Real Backbone Little Pepe comes in with a story deeper than the usual hoping frog gimmicks. It aims to be the new frontier of the meme community by bringing real utility into the game. Since its June 10 presale launch at $0.001, it has rocketed through stages at lightning speed, now in Stage 5 at $0.0014, with over $5 million raised and 4.1 billion tokens sold. What makes Little Pepe special? It fuses meme virality with serious blockchain utility, delivering a Layer 2 EVM chain purpose-built for meme economies. Transactions are ultra-fast and cost almost nothing, while a zero-tax structure ensures traders can enter and exit without hidden penalties. Most importantly, Little Pepe introduces Pepe’s Pump Pad, a launchpad that allows anyone to create new meme tokens safely. Every token launched is automatically liquidity-locked and sniper bot-resistant, solving long-standing problems in the meme space. The community is buzzing, the Telegram group is growing rapidly, and an ongoing $777,000 giveaway is supercharging global awareness. Ten winners will walk away with $77,000 each in $LILPEPE tokens, and early entrants have a higher chance of winning. Beyond the hype, Little Pepe’s roadmap is ambitious: major CEX listings post-presale, a full rollout of Layer 2, and a push into the top 100 on CoinMarketCap. These pillars create real long-term value for investors looking beyond short-term pumps. With each presale stage price rising, and the next stage jumping to $0.0015, now is the time to position early before broader listings ignite massive exposure. For anyone seeking a token that embodies meme magic while delivering tangible on-chain innovation, Little Pepe stands at the very top of the list for July 2025. Aptos (APT): Bridging Real-World Assets and DeFi Aptos has emerged as a primary force in bridging traditional finance and blockchain. In the past 30 days alone, its Real-World Asset (RWA) Total Value Locked (TVL) surged to $538 million, making it the third-largest RWA platform globally. Powered by the Move programming language, Aptos offers unparalleled security and speed, catching the attention of institutional investors and government bodies alike. In a groundbreaking development, Wyoming has chosen Aptos as the top blockchain candidate to host its WYST stablecoin , signaling institutional confidence. Aptos Price chart | Source: CoinGecko The Aptos DeFi ecosystem is thriving too. Its DEX volume recently surpassed $183 million, setting a new all-time high. Analysts predict that if APT breaks the $20 barrier, it could surge toward $100 by year-end, driven by strong network fundamentals and traditional finance (TradFi) integrations. For investors seeking a chain that combines DeFi momentum with serious institutional traction, Aptos is a must-watch. Sui (SUI): DeFi Resurgence and Technical Edge Sui staged a powerful comeback this month, soaring by over 43% from June lows to trade above $3.30. Backed by ex-Facebook engineers and a deep focus on user experience, Sui’s network has become a hotbed for DeFi innovation. The ecosystem now boasts over 70 decentralized applications and a TVL above $2.6 billion, showing a strong rebound after recent exploits in its ecosystem. The recent Grayscale report highlighted Sui’s superior tech and robust architecture, fueling investor confidence. With adjusted transaction volume skyrocketing to $151 billion, experts foresee a move toward double-digit territory, possibly $10 or even $15 by December, making Sui a top mid-cap bet this summer. Sui Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Ripple (XRP): Institutional Wave and ETF Catalyst Ripple’s XRP has reclaimed momentum in a big way, surging past $2.40 and breaking out of a long-standing wedge pattern. With 6.6 million holders, XRP’s network growth is undeniable, and trading volume has jumped from $2.5 billion to over $4.5 billion in just one day. XRP Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Institutional interest is booming: XRP was recently added to Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund , and ten XRP spot ETF applications are now awaiting SEC approval. Ripple’s push for a U.S. national bank charter is another bullish catalyst, potentially cementing XRP as a backbone for mainstream banking and crypto payments. Analysts predict that XRP will aim for $3 this summer and potentially reach $5–$10 by the end of Q4, positioning it firmly in the “buy now” category for investors betting on regulatory breakthroughs and mass adoption. Hedera (HBAR): Bullish Breakout Incoming Hedera has been on a stealth run but is now breaking into the spotlight. HBAR recently reached a one-month high of $0.20 and is forming a bullish double-bottom pattern that could propel it to $0.42, representing a 150% rally. Hedera Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko The Hedera network has added $90 million in stablecoin market capitalization in just two weeks, and its DeFi Total Value Locked has grown from $72 million to $89 million, representing a 24% increase. The market structure looks strong, with RSI moving above 50 and long positions increasing significantly. HBAR could trade between $1 and $3 by year-end, especially if its spot ETFs are approved by the SEC. This upside potential makes the current price a lovely entry point. A Portfolio Built for the Next Crypto Boom Each of these tokens, Little Pepe, Aptos, Sui, Ripple, and Hedera, brings something unique to the table: whether it’s meme virality, institutional DeFi growth, or regulatory breakthroughs. Together, they create a diversified bet on the different narratives driving this new crypto cycle. However, Little Pepe stands out as the most explosive candidate, combining community energy with real Layer 2 utility. Already raising over $5 million in its presale, with a rapidly rising price and a clear roadmap, it represents a potential 100x or even 1000x opportunity. Join the presale today at littlepepe.com before the next price stage kicks in and before the frog leaps too far ahead.

This pivotal investment, spearheaded by industry giant Galaxy Digital, with key participation from Antalpha and Mantle, marks a resounding vote of confidence in Function’s vision and its flagship product, FBTC. Function Crypto: Powering the Future of Digital Assets Have you ever wondered what truly underpins the rapidly expanding world of cryptocurrencies? It’s not just about the digital coins themselves, but the robust, secure, and scalable systems that allow them to function. This is where Function Crypto steps in. As a dedicated crypto infrastructure firm, Function is committed to building the foundational layers necessary for the widespread adoption and seamless operation of digital assets. Think of it like the internet. While we see websites and applications, there’s a vast, complex infrastructure of servers, networks, and protocols working tirelessly behind the scenes. Similarly, for blockchain and cryptocurrencies, firms like Function are developing the essential tools, platforms, and services that enable everything from secure transactions to the creation of innovative financial products. Their work is crucial for bringing stability and efficiency to a dynamic ecosystem. Why This Strategic Seed Funding Round Matters The announcement of a $10 million seed funding round for Function Crypto is more than just a financial headline; it’s a powerful indicator of market sentiment and future direction. Led by Galaxy Digital, a prominent player in the digital asset and blockchain space, this investment underscores the growing institutional appetite for robust, reliable crypto solutions. The participation of Antalpha and Mantle further solidifies the broad industry support for Function’s mission. Why is a seed round of this magnitude so significant? Seed funding is typically the earliest stage of investment, often provided to promising startups to help them develop their product, build their team, and establish market presence. For Function, this $10 million injection means accelerated growth, enhanced product development, and the ability to scale their operations to meet the increasing demand for secure crypto infrastructure. It’s a testament to the potential investors see in Function’s ability to solve critical industry challenges. Strengthening the Core: The Importance of Robust Crypto Infrastructure The cryptocurrency market has matured significantly, but it still faces challenges related to scalability, security, and regulatory clarity. This is precisely why strong crypto infrastructure is not just important, but absolutely vital for the industry’s continued growth and mainstream acceptance. Without reliable underlying systems, the promise of decentralized finance and digital assets remains largely unfulfilled. Function’s work directly addresses these challenges by building secure and efficient frameworks. Consider the implications: Enhanced Security: Protecting billions in digital assets requires state-of-the-art security protocols. Improved Scalability: As more users enter the space, the infrastructure must handle increased transaction volumes without compromising performance. Regulatory Compliance: Building systems that can adapt to evolving regulatory landscapes is key for institutional adoption. By focusing on these core areas, Function is not just creating products; they are contributing to the very stability and trustworthiness of the entire digital economy. Their infrastructure solutions pave the way for more institutions and individuals to confidently participate in the crypto space. Unpacking FBTC Bitcoin: A Pillar of Trust and Transparency At the heart of Function’s current success and future plans lies FBTC Bitcoin , their innovative fully reserved Bitcoin (BTC) product. With an impressive $1.5 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL), FBTC has quickly established itself as a significant player in the ecosystem. But what does ‘fully reserved’ truly mean, and why is it so important? A fully reserved product means that for every unit of FBTC issued, there is an equivalent amount of actual Bitcoin held in reserve. This 1:1 backing provides unparalleled transparency and reduces counterparty risk, offering users and institutions a secure and verifiable way to interact with Bitcoin without directly holding the underlying asset. In a market where trust is paramount, FBTC stands out as a beacon of reliability. The $1.5 billion TVL signifies substantial confidence from the market, reflecting a strong demand for a transparent, auditable Bitcoin product. The new funding will directly support the expansion of FBTC, potentially leading to new features, broader accessibility, and even greater liquidity, further solidifying its position as a go-to reserved Bitcoin solution. The Broader Picture: Accelerating Digital Asset Investment Trends Function’s successful funding round is not an isolated event; it’s a clear signal within the broader landscape of digital asset investment . Institutional players like Galaxy Digital are increasingly looking beyond speculative trading to invest in the fundamental building blocks of the crypto economy. This shift indicates a maturing market where value is being recognized in the underlying technology and infrastructure rather than just the price volatility of individual assets. The commitment from major investors highlights several key trends: Focus on Utility: Investments are flowing into projects that offer real utility and solve tangible problems within the crypto space. Institutional Confidence: More traditional financial entities are entering the crypto market, bringing significant capital and demanding robust, compliant solutions. Long-Term Vision: Seed funding in infrastructure firms suggests a long-term belief in the growth and integration of digital assets into the global financial system. This investment in Function not only propels the company forward but also sends a powerful message to the wider market: the future of digital assets is being built on solid foundations, attracting serious capital and talent. A New Era for Bitcoin Infrastructure Function’s $10 million seed funding round is a monumental step, not just for the company, but for the entire crypto ecosystem. By strengthening their core crypto infrastructure and expanding their highly trusted FBTC Bitcoin product, Function is playing a vital role in building a more secure, transparent, and accessible digital financial future. This significant digital asset investment is a clear indicator that the industry is moving towards greater maturity and institutional adoption, paving the way for unprecedented innovation and growth.

According to recent data , Coinbase (COIN) shares hit an all-time high of $398.50 during trading on July 14. However, the COIN shares ended the day with approximately $394, a 2% increase during the trading period. Coinbase Might be a Trillion-Dollar Company Soon This price increase has led industry experts and investors to discuss the company’s long-term potential. Kylie Reidhead, co-owner of the crypto-focused media outlet Milk Road, highlighted Coinbase’s rapid growth in a post on X , comparing it to Amazon’s success in retail and Netflix’s impact on entertainment. He suggested that Coinbase might become a trillion-dollar company in the coming years. Kyle also noted that the exchange is working to improve the current financial system. It is worth noting that Coinbase’s growth comes as institutional interest in cryptocurrencies increases. The company’s growth is also attributed to its efforts to offer a wide range of products and establish stronger partnerships with major financial institutions. However, some market analysts are not as optimistic about Coinbase. A post on X revealed that some worry that the company’s valuation appears moderately overvalued. Critics think that while Coinbase has strong fundamentals, its current market value may be more influenced by speculation than by real earnings growth. Coinbase Shares Outperform S&P 500 Stocks Recall that the publicly-listed stock outperformed the broader market, including the other shares in the S&P 500, in June. As reported by TheCoinRise, COIN rose by 43%, surpassing the other shares to become the top performer in the S&P 500. Interestingly, the 43% surge pushed COIN to its highest level ever since its public debut in 2021. Meanwhile, the spike is primarily attributed to a shift in investor focus towards stablecoin revenue, triggered by Washington’s progress on the GENIUS Act for stablecoin regulation. This outlook is fueled by a series of positive institutional news entering the market. One of these is JPMorgan’s trademark application for digital asset services. Coinbase Builds a New Foundation for the Financial System Notably, the leading digital currency platform has made a strong statement about the future of global finance . The company believes crypto can help solve key problems in today’s financial system, such as rising debt, inflation, and growing distrust in banks. According to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, digital currencies are tools that can help build a stronger, fairer economy. Under the leadership of its CEO, Coinbase is expanding its role from a trading platform to a complete financial services provider. It now supports various digital tools and wants to help build the next generation of internet-based financial systems.

This transformation is underscored by a recent report from Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest commercial bank, which highlights a notable decline in Bitcoin’s volatility. This isn’t just a fleeting trend; it’s a profound shift signaling a new era for the crypto market , one where stability and broader acceptance are becoming the norm rather than the exception. Understanding Bitcoin Volatility: A Journey Towards Stability For years, Bitcoin volatility was synonymous with its identity. Its price swings were legendary, offering both exhilarating gains and gut-wrenching losses. This inherent unpredictability often deterred traditional investors and large institutions, who prioritize stability and predictable returns. However, Deutsche Bank’s analysis, as reported by CoinDesk, reveals a compelling narrative: despite Bitcoin’s record-breaking rallies, its volatility has significantly decreased. What does this mean for the future of digital assets? Historically, Bitcoin’s price movements were heavily influenced by retail investor sentiment, news cycles, and speculative trading. Large price swings could occur with minimal trading volume. Now, the landscape is evolving. Increased liquidity, a wider array of sophisticated trading instruments, and the entry of more diverse participants are collectively contributing to a more stable environment. This shift is crucial for Bitcoin to transcend its ‘speculative asset’ label and be recognized as a legitimate investment vehicle. Consider the factors that typically drive asset volatility: Market Depth: A shallow market, where large orders can significantly impact price, leads to higher volatility. As Bitcoin’s market depth grows, it can absorb larger trades with less impact. Investor Demographics: A market dominated by short-term speculators tends to be more volatile. The influx of long-term holders and institutional investors mitigates this. Regulatory Clarity: Uncertainty breeds volatility. Clear regulations reduce risk premiums and foster confidence. Macroeconomic Factors: Like traditional assets, Bitcoin is increasingly influenced by global economic trends, interest rates, and inflation, indicating its integration into the broader financial system. The observed volatility decline is not accidental; it’s a consequence of fundamental changes within the Bitcoin ecosystem. The Unstoppable March of Institutional Adoption One of the primary catalysts behind Bitcoin’s newfound stability is the surging wave of institutional adoption . What began as a niche interest for tech-savvy individuals has now captured the attention, and capital, of some of the world’s most conservative financial entities. Pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and large asset managers are no longer just observing; many are actively allocating capital to Bitcoin and other digital assets. Why are these traditional giants entering the fray? The answer lies in diversification, inflation hedging potential, and the recognition of Bitcoin as a legitimate, albeit nascent, asset class. Their entry brings significant capital, but more importantly, it brings a long-term investment horizon. Unlike retail traders who might panic sell during downturns, institutions often buy and hold, providing a strong floor for the market. This long-term perspective naturally dampens short-term price fluctuations. Examples of increasing institutional interest include: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in major markets, opening doors for regulated access. Major financial institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest launching their own Bitcoin-related products. Corporations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Traditional banks exploring blockchain technology and digital asset services. This institutional embrace is a powerful testament to Bitcoin’s evolving status. It signifies a maturation from a fringe asset to one increasingly integrated into the global financial fabric. Is Increased Regulation a Blessing for the Crypto Market? For many early crypto enthusiasts, the idea of regulation was anathema, seen as an encroachment on the decentralized ethos. However, the reality is that increased regulatory clarity is proving to be a significant boon for the entire crypto market . Deutsche Bank’s report specifically highlights this aspect as a key driver of stability. Regulation brings legitimacy, reduces risks for investors, and fosters a safer environment for innovation. When financial products are regulated, they become more accessible to a broader range of investors, particularly the institutional players mentioned earlier, who operate under strict compliance mandates. Clear rules around custody, trading, and asset classification build trust and encourage participation. Consider the benefits of a well-regulated crypto environment: Aspect Impact of Regulation Investor Protection Reduces fraud, enhances transparency, provides recourse for investors. Market Integrity Combats market manipulation, ensures fair trading practices. Institutional Participation Provides legal and compliance frameworks for large entities to engage. Innovation & Growth Creates a predictable environment for businesses to build and expand. While the path to comprehensive global crypto regulation is still unfolding, the progress made so far has undeniably contributed to the observed reduction in Bitcoin’s volatility. It’s a clear signal that the industry is moving towards a more structured and robust future. Deutsche Bank’s Profound Perspective: A Game Changer? The fact that Deutsche Bank , a titan of traditional finance with a history spanning over 150 years, is issuing such a report on Bitcoin’s maturity is incredibly significant. For a long time, major banks maintained a skeptical, if not outright dismissive, stance towards cryptocurrencies. Their pivot, even if cautious, signals a broader acceptance within the traditional financial establishment. Deutsche Bank’s analysis isn’t merely an observation; it’s an acknowledgment that Bitcoin is evolving into an asset class that warrants serious consideration alongside traditional investments. When a bank of this stature highlights decreasing volatility and the role of institutional adoption, it lends immense credibility to the cryptocurrency space. This perspective can influence other major financial players and even policymakers, accelerating the integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. Their report validates the long-held belief by crypto proponents that Bitcoin, despite its turbulent youth, possesses the fundamental characteristics to become a resilient and enduring store of value. It’s a powerful endorsement that could encourage more conservative investors, like pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, to explore allocations to digital assets, further solidifying the market’s stability. Navigating the Future: What Does Reduced Volatility Mean for Investors? The continued volatility decline in Bitcoin presents both opportunities and considerations for investors. For long-term holders and those looking for a store of value, reduced volatility makes Bitcoin a far more appealing proposition. It mitigates the risk of sudden, drastic losses, allowing for a more predictable investment experience. Benefits for Investors: Increased Appeal to Conservative Investors: Pension funds, endowments, and sovereign wealth funds can now consider Bitcoin more seriously for long-term diversification. Enhanced Portfolio Stability: For portfolios that include Bitcoin, reduced volatility can lead to smoother overall returns and lower risk. Foundation for Financial Products: A more stable Bitcoin facilitates the development of more sophisticated financial products, such as lending, borrowing, and derivatives, further integrating it into the financial system. Greater Predictability: While no asset is entirely predictable, lower volatility allows for more reliable long-term financial planning. Challenges and Considerations: Not Zero Volatility: It’s crucial to remember that ‘reduced’ volatility does not mean ‘zero’ volatility. Bitcoin will still experience price swings, albeit less extreme ones. Macroeconomic Influences: As Bitcoin integrates, it becomes more susceptible to global economic factors like inflation, interest rate changes, and geopolitical events. Market Maturation vs. Growth Potential: Some early investors might lament the loss of extreme volatility, which offered opportunities for rapid, large gains. However, maturity often comes with more sustainable, albeit slower, growth. Actionable Insights for Investors: Long-Term Horizon: Embrace Bitcoin as a long-term asset. Its value proposition strengthens over extended periods, especially with declining volatility. Diversification: While more stable, Bitcoin should still be part of a diversified portfolio, not its sole component. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments and institutional movements, as these will continue to shape the market. Risk Management: Understand your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. Even with reduced volatility, Bitcoin remains a dynamic asset. A New Dawn for Bitcoin and the Crypto Market The findings from Deutsche Bank paint a clear picture: Bitcoin is shedding its wild west image and maturing into a sophisticated financial asset. The convergence of declining volatility , increasing institutional adoption , and growing regulatory clarity is fundamentally reshaping the entire crypto market . This evolution is not just a statistical anomaly; it’s a profound transformation that makes Bitcoin increasingly appealing to a broader spectrum of investors, from individual enthusiasts to massive sovereign wealth funds. The endorsement from a venerable institution like Deutsche Bank serves as a powerful signal, reinforcing the idea that digital assets are here to stay and will play an increasingly vital role in the global financial landscape. As Bitcoin continues its journey towards greater stability, it opens up unprecedented opportunities for long-term growth and integration, promising a future where digital assets are a cornerstone of diverse investment portfolios.

If so, the recent announcement from BTCS Inc. (Nasdaq: BTCS) is certainly one to pay attention to. In a strategic maneuver that underscores growing institutional confidence in digital assets, BTCS has significantly expanded its Ethereum (ETH) reserves, making a substantial bet on the future of the second-largest cryptocurrency. Understanding BTCS’s Bold Move: Expanding ETH Holdings In a clear signal of its long-term vision, BTCS Inc. recently revealed its latest strategic acquisition. The company announced via X that it successfully borrowed $2.34 million USDT through the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol AAVE. This leveraged position was then utilized to acquire an impressive 2,731 ETH for a total of $8.23 million. This isn’t just a minor top-up; it’s a significant increase that brings BTCS’s total ETH holdings to an astounding 31,855 ETH. This move is particularly noteworthy for several reasons: Leveraged Growth: Utilizing DeFi platforms like AAVE for borrowing allows companies to expand their asset base without immediately liquidating existing holdings, potentially amplifying returns if the acquired asset appreciates. Significant Scale: With 31,855 ETH, BTCS now commands a substantial portfolio of one of the crypto market’s foundational assets. Market Valuation: Following this acquisition, the company’s total crypto and cash market value has surged to approximately $100.6 million, solidifying its position as a key player in the digital asset investment space. Why Ethereum? The Power of a Leading Digital Asset The decision by BTCS to focus heavily on Ethereum is not arbitrary. Ethereum stands as the backbone of the decentralized web, powering countless decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and the vast DeFi ecosystem. Its ongoing evolution, particularly with the transition to Ethereum 2.0 (now known as the Consensus Layer and Execution Layer upgrades), promises enhanced scalability, security, and sustainability through a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Here’s why Ethereum remains a prime target for institutional investors: Ecosystem Dominance: Ethereum boasts the largest and most active developer community in the blockchain space, constantly innovating and building new use cases. Staking Rewards: With the move to Proof-of-Stake, ETH holders can stake their assets to earn rewards, providing a passive income stream that can enhance long-term holding profitability. Deflationary Mechanism: The EIP-1559 upgrade introduced a burning mechanism for a portion of transaction fees, potentially making ETH a deflationary asset over time, which could increase its scarcity and value. Institutional Acceptance: Increasingly, major financial institutions are exploring or directly engaging with Ethereum, recognizing its critical role in the future of finance and technology. BTCS’s increased exposure to ETH positions them to benefit directly from Ethereum’s continued growth and adoption across various sectors. The Broader Implications of This Crypto Acquisition What does this significant crypto acquisition by BTCS mean for the wider market? It serves as a powerful indicator of several trends: Increasing Institutional Confidence: This move highlights a growing trend among publicly traded companies to integrate cryptocurrencies into their balance sheets or investment strategies. It signals a maturation of the crypto market, moving beyond speculative retail trading to more structured corporate investments. Strategic Use of DeFi: The fact that BTCS leveraged AAVE, a DeFi protocol, for its loan demonstrates the increasing sophistication of institutional engagement with decentralized finance. It shows that DeFi is no longer just for crypto natives but is becoming a viable tool for corporate treasury management and capital allocation. Long-Term Bullish Sentiment: Acquiring such a large amount of ETH, especially using leverage, suggests a strong long-term bullish outlook on Ethereum’s price trajectory and its fundamental value. Companies like BTCS are not just holding; they are actively accumulating, anticipating future appreciation. Diversification of Digital Assets: While Bitcoin often grabs headlines, this acquisition underscores the importance of diversifying within the digital asset space. Ethereum, with its robust ecosystem and utility, offers a different risk-reward profile and growth potential. This development could inspire other companies to explore similar strategies, further driving institutional adoption and legitimizing the cryptocurrency market in the eyes of traditional finance. Navigating the Digital Assets Landscape: What Investors Should Know For individual investors, BTCS’s move offers valuable insights into how sophisticated players are approaching the volatile world of digital assets . While the specific strategies of a publicly traded company may differ from those of a retail investor, the underlying principles often remain relevant. Key Takeaways for Investors: Research is Paramount: Understand the fundamentals of the cryptocurrencies you invest in. Why is Ethereum valuable? What are its use cases? What are the risks? Long-Term Vision: Institutional acquisitions like this often reflect a long-term investment horizon, looking beyond short-term price fluctuations to capitalize on foundational growth. Risk Management: While leverage can amplify gains, it also magnifies losses. For individual investors, understanding and managing risk through appropriate position sizing and diversification is crucial. Stay Informed: The crypto market evolves rapidly. Keeping up with news, technological advancements, and regulatory changes is vital for informed decision-making. BTCS’s substantial increase in its ETH holdings is a testament to the evolving strategies employed by publicly traded companies in the crypto space. It highlights a growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition and the potential for significant returns from strategic investments in leading digital assets. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Corporate Crypto Adoption BTCS Inc.’s latest move to significantly bolster its ETH holdings is more than just a transaction; it’s a strategic statement. By leveraging DeFi to acquire a substantial amount of Ethereum, BTCS is demonstrating a sophisticated approach to capital allocation within the digital economy. This crypto acquisition not only enhances their existing portfolio but also reinforces the growing narrative of institutional embrace of digital assets , particularly Ethereum , as a core component of future corporate strategies. As the crypto market continues to mature, we can expect to see more companies like BTCS making bold moves, further integrating blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies into the global financial landscape. This trend signals a promising future for the broader adoption and legitimization of decentralized finance and digital currencies.

In the past 24 hours alone, $PENGU jumped 20.8%, vaulting from an intraday low of $0.0270 to a high of $0.0344, a 27.4% swing demonstrating intense volatility. As of July 15, $PENGU is trading at $0.03418. The token has seen a volume spike and whale accumulation, indicating continued appetite for risk amid broader crypto rallies. Source: CoinGecko Meme Coin Momentum Reinforced by ETF Buzz and Social Endorsements The $PENGU token has rapidly transitioned from a niche NFT experiment to a multi‑faceted Web3 brand, driven by speculative ETF filings, high‑profile endorsements, and major retail partnerships. Since its Solana launch in late 2024, $PENGU has seen its price double amid Coinbase’s penguin avatar stunt and ETF rumors, as observers wonder if it will become the biggest memecoin of the summer. $PENGU’s fundamentals now rest on a tight 63 billion‑token float against a capped 88.88 billion supply, with almost 26% locked for community rewards and an airdrop that seeded hundreds of thousands of wallets last December but remains largely unspent. That sense of scarcity quickly became a marketing asset. When Coinbase and Binance US briefly swapped their social‑media avatars for Pudgy Penguins artwork , it ignited a 60% weekly sprint that took on institutional backing once Cboe filed a Form 19b‑4 to list the Canary PENG ETF and the SEC logged its companion S‑1. Both filings propose allocating 95% of the fund’s holdings to PENG tokens, with the remaining 5% earmarked for Pudgy Penguin NFTs, an unprecedented structure designed to blend liquid token exposure with the rarity and collectibility of the underlying art. canary capital filing first-ever NFT-backed ETF. 80-95% $PENGU token, 5-15% curated pudgy nfts not just floor sweeping but rarity-based selection — aixbt (@aixbt_agent) March 28, 2025 Additionally, within 24 hours of Coinbase’s stunt, the loop rally strengthened as the NFT floor price leapt from about 9 ETH to 11.6 ETH, showing how the token and collection move in tandem. Liquidity followed, and the token’s revival from an April price struggle of around $0.028 to $0.0037 in July returned $PENGU to the mid‑cap league in barely three months, according to CoinMarketCap . Just five days ago, $PENGU jumped 33% alone. I gave you all $Pengu at a 200 million dollar market cap back in April. Today it just reclaimed a 2 billion dollar market cap. That’s a clean 10x. Follow me for more alpha calls. pic.twitter.com/4kA1faDCM1 — Moose (@JoeyMooose) July 15, 2025 Smart money seems convinced by the return, with on‑chain trackers flagging whales buying $PENGU in large volumes and even billionaires like Justin Sun endorsing the project. $PENGU/USDT Maintains Bullish Structure as Price Approaches $0.0360 Resistance The PENGU/USDT 4-hour chart from July 11 to 15 shows a strong uptrend. The price moved sideways between $0.012 and $0.018 for a while, but buyers took control on July 13 and pushed it higher. On July 14, the price broke above the key $0.0300 level, confirming growing momentum. That level has now turned into solid support, holding steady through several retests. As long as this support holds, buyers remain in charge. $PENGU/USDT price chart, July 15 (Source: TradingView) The rally continued into July 15, carrying $PENGU to fresh highs and is currently trading around $0.03455. Trading activity rose during the breakout, reflecting strong participation, a positive indicator for sustainability. Breakouts accompanied by rising volume typically indicate genuine demand, reducing the likelihood of a false move. The price structure has consistently formed higher highs and higher lows, a hallmark of a strong uptrend. This pattern demonstrates sustained buyer dominance across multiple sessions, reinforcing bullish conviction. The volume footprint chart provides extra insight. A major event occurred during the 08:00 UTC 4‑hour candle on July 15. The data shows a large negative delta of –126.25 million, indicating that aggressive market sells outnumbered market buys in that candle. However, despite this heavy selling pressure, the price did not drop. Instead, the candle remained green and continued pushing higher. This indicates that strong buy orders were absorbing the selling pressure, allowing $PENGU to climb steadily. Such absorption shows buyers are still in control, and the trend remains supported beneath the surface. The price now approaches a key resistance zone between $0.0350 and $0.0360, an area reinforced by recent bullish momentum. This level aligns with historical seller interest, increasing the likelihood of supply pressure. A decisive breakout above this zone, supported by strong volume, could indicate a continuation toward higher targets. Conversely, rejection here may trigger a retracement toward the $0.0310 support level, a logical consolidation point before any renewed upside attempt.

This message from Dimon attracted attention while answering questions about stablecoin technology at the balance sheet meeting held today. Stablecoins, as their name suggests, are cryptocurrencies typically pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, aiming for stability in value. Last month, JPMorgan announced the development of a limited stablecoin solution designed exclusively for its own clients. However, a more general stablecoin is expected to appeal to a much broader user base. “As JPMorgan, we will be involved in both our own deposit coin and stablecoins. We want to understand this space and become proficient in it,” Dimon said. “Stablecoins are real. However, I still don't fully understand why you would want to use a stablecoin instead of making a payment directly.” Related News: US President Donald Trump Makes Hot Remarks on Cryptocurrencies - Shares a Long Statement Dimon, 69, is known for his criticism of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. However, JPMorgan's massive presence in the sector, with a daily global payment volume of approximately $10 trillion, means the company cannot afford to neglect emerging payment technologies. Dimon stated that fintech companies trying to create alternatives to the traditional banking system pose a threat, saying, “These guys are very smart. They want to create bank accounts, access payment systems, and offer rewards programs. We need to be aware of this. The way to do this is to be active in this area.” Citigroup executives also stated in a statement today that they are exploring the possibility of issuing stablecoins and that they see opportunities, particularly in areas such as tokenized deposits and the storage of crypto assets. *This is not investment advice.

The spike came as Bitcoin prices peaked at $123.218K on July 14, marking the coin’s most recent ATH. The data revealed that BTC exchange reserves jumped +0.91% to 2.265M, following the uptick in BTC exchange inflows in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin exchange netflow was positive, increasing 3.73% to 21.81K BTC. There was also a 2.24 Bitcoin exchange inflow mean, representing a 3.64% rise. The top 10 exchange inflow metric also showed an increase of 3.17% to 3.656K BTC. Bitcoin exchange depositing transactions inched up 1.03% to 43.552K as BTC depositing addresses also went up 1.13% to 2.29K. Bitcoin exchange inflows were at 83.99K as of publication, an increase of 2.37% from yesterday. CryptoQuant analysis suggests bullish whale activity Source: CryptoQuant Bitcoin exchange inflows go up on July 15. A CryptoQuant analyst claimed that a surge in exchange inflows indicated a “local top” likely to result in a “healthy price correction” or near-term consolidation. The analyst also believes that the spike in BTC exchange inflows (especially to CEXs) suggested short-term profit-taking whale activity. Another CryptoQuant contributor pointed out a wallet dormant for over 14 years with 80K BTC that had just offloaded about 20K BTC, much of which ended up in CEXs. The analyst added that the recent positive movement in BTC exchange inflows was a classic pattern following parabolic rallies. Profits were realized, weak positions exited, and BTC prices found a new base. The market structure generally remained “largely bullish” despite looming signs of price correction. Long-term holders also sat tight on their BTC bounty. Another CryptoQuant contributor partly agreed that the surge in BTC deposits to exchanges was likely due to activity by large-scale investors. Whales reportedly deposited 1.8K BTC to Binance in one day, with over 35% of the transactions clocking over $1 million, noted the contributor. The analyst claimed that whales leveraged the deep liquidity in exchanges to speculate, possibly for profit-taking. The contributor also concluded that the surge was likely due to two scenarios. First, investors likely sat on “healthy profits” and sought to make some profit. Secondly, investors possibly aimed to leverage Binance’s liquidity to open positions or hedge amid heightened market volatility. Julio Moreno, the Head of Research at CryptoQuant, believes that rising BTC exchange inflows precede price volatility. An independent crypto analyst claimed that the wave of BTC hitting exchanges usually suggested that wallets were preparing to sell. The analyst pointed out a similar spike in March 2024, followed by a drop of 8-12% within 48 hours. Large holders likely sent BTC to “spot venues” to rotate or liquidate. Daily BTC exchange inflow drops CryptoQuant’s Moreno said on July 11 that daily BTC exchange inflows fell to their lowest since April 2015, plummeting to 18K BTC . He also revealed that large Bitcoin holders were sending fewer coins to exchanges, with the amount coming from this group falling to only 7K BTC, down from 62K BTC in November last year. Moreno emphasized that the increase in BTC price resulted in low selling pressure. He pointed out that whale activity had dropped, but mentioned that the trend was common across the crypto industry. Moreno also observed that the current BTC rally was much calmer than the early 2021 and late 2017 bull runs. CryptoQuant research suggested that fewer daily BTC flows from large and small holders to exchanges signaled less selling pressure. It also implied that the market had yet to enter “overheating mode.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",Bitcoin|BTC|CryptoQuant,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-15 19:25:01

The company’s convertible note offerings remain a popular funding route even amid equity market volatility. Digital assets continue to enter treasury management discussions, but adoption strategies are uneven. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen said on Tuesday that the company’s recent Bitcoin purchase was meant as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty. According to his comments made during a July 15 appearance on CNBC, the company is not making an attempt to follow other corporate treasury approaches like Strategy (previously known as MicroStrategy). Bitcoin as a Hedge Against Inflation “I look at it as a hedge against inflation and global money printing, and we’ll see what happens,” Cohen said. GameStop acquired 4,710 bitcoins in late May, valued at over $500 million. The purchase followed a series of corporate moves by firms like Strategy, which accumulated billions of dollars in Bitcoin in recent years. Cohen clarified that GameStop’s move was unrelated. GameStop has purchased 4,710 Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/gGdr0BRrAv — GameStop (@gamestop) May 28, 2025 “We have our own unique strategy, and we have a very strong balance sheet, over $9 billion of cash and marketable securities,” he said. Cohen said the company would maintain a disciplined approach in deploying capital. “We will deploy that capital responsibly as I would my own capital, and only look for opportunities where the downside is limited and there’s a lot of upside,” he said. “We’ll be opportunistic when we see those opportunities.” GameStop’s crypto position is part of Cohen’s effort to stabilize operations. The company has shifted its business mix, focusing more on trading cards and collectibles. New Outlook for GameStop The CEO added that GameStop has moved away from its earlier dependence on hardware and software. He said the retailer has now made a “significant” shift toward those newer segments. “We will deploy that capital responsibly as I would my own capital, and only look for opportunities where the downside is limited and there’s a lot of upside,” Cohen said. “We’ll be opportunistic when we see those opportunities.” The company recently raised $2.25 billion through an upsized convertible note offering. The zero-coupon notes carry a conversion price of approximately $28.91 per share, reflecting a 32.5% premium over the stock’s average trading price at the time of announcement. The offering follows a similar $1.5 billion raise in April and comes amid ongoing volatility in the company’s stock, which fell 24% in the past week. Some public companies are exploring Bitcoin as a reserve asset, but with different levels of exposure. Strategy has taken an aggressive approach, while others, including Tesla and Block, have kept their holdings limited. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Are there accounting standards specific to corporate Bitcoin holdings? Yes. Under current U.S. GAAP, Bitcoin is treated as an intangible asset, meaning it must be written down for impairments but cannot be marked up if its value increases. This has raised concerns about transparency and financial reporting accuracy. How do zero-coupon convertible notes affect existing shareholders? Convertible notes issued at a premium typically delay dilution but still create the possibility of future share issuance. If converted, the new shares can dilute existing ownership depending on the stock price performance at maturity. What regulatory developments could impact corporate BTC adoption? The SEC and FASB have both initiated reviews related to digital asset disclosure, particularly after the rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Future rules may clarify how corporations report holdings or manage risk, potentially influencing more widespread adoption.

Whale short exposure shows market split, even as long-term holders continue to stack Bitcoin. BTC inflows hit $3.7B last week, pushing assets under management to a record $211 billion. Long-Term Holders Step Up Accumulation Bitcoin wallets known for never selling have added about 248,000 BTC this month, according to data from CryptoQuant. These addresses are called “accumulators” because they only receive Bitcoin and have no record of moving units out. The monthly average sits closer to 164,000 BTC, which means most of the recent buying happened in just a few weeks. At current prices, this stash is worth around $30 billion. It shows that some players are adding to their holdings even as Bitcoin trades near all-time highs. Source: CryptoQuant Caution Remains If Prices Pull Back If Bitcoin enters a correction or moves sideways for a while, some of these wallets may start selling. That would pull out their accumulator status and might result in a new supply in the market. Meanwhile, most of them are clinging. This pattern signals a strong interest in holding BTC long term, even as price swings remain sharp. It’s not a guarantee of future price moves, but it adds context to recent demand. At the same time, big trades over $1 million are showing short exposure. Joao Wedson from Alphractal says whales are currently leaning bearish based on tools that track volume and open interest.

The mixed signals between whales and accumulator wallets show that not everyone agrees on what comes next. Key Levels After Recent Price Drop Bitcoin was trading around $116,500 at the time of writing. That’s a drop of 4.5% in 24 hours, but still up 8% over the last week. Analyst Ali Martinez said the price recently hit a target near $121,000, with the next levels at $131,000, $144,000, and $158,000. Some are pointing to a possible top around $200,000 later this year if the current chart pattern plays out. Nothing is certain, but the momentum remains strong for now. Funds tied to crypto brought in $3.7 billion last week alone. That’s the second-biggest weekly inflow ever. Year-to-date inflows are now $22.7 billion.

In today's vote, a proposal that would have paved the way for discussion of three important cryptocurrency bills was rejected by 223 “no” votes to 196. According to parliamentary sources, a retry is scheduled for midnight the same day. During what has been dubbed “Crypto Week,” two major bills were on the House agenda: the National Innovation Guidelines and Establishment for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS) and the Digital Asset Market Openness Act (Clarity). The GENIUS bill has already passed the Senate and is expected to reach President Trump's desk by the end of the week. The GENIUS law stipulates that stablecoin issuances must be fully collateralized only by US dollars or similar liquid assets, requires annual audits for issuers with a market capitalization over $50 billion, and establishes rules for overseas stablecoin issuance. Related News: Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Hater JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon Backtracked Again: “I Still Don't Fully Understand It, But...” The Clarity Act, meanwhile, aims to clarify the regulatory framework for crypto assets by offering a more comprehensive approach. It clarifies the roles and jurisdictions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), as well as requiring digital asset service providers to notify individual investors and segregate client funds from company assets. A vote was also expected in the House this week on a bill spearheaded by House Republican Deputy Chairman Tom Emmer, which aims to block the direct issuance of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to individuals. However, the procedural vote failed after 12 Republicans, including Marjorie Taylor Greene, Chip Roy, Michael Cloud, and Anna Paulina Luna, voted “no.” House Speaker Mike Johnson stated that some opposition lawmakers had demanded that all crypto bills be merged into a single text. *This is not investment advice.

Imagine a world where all your digital asset needs are met within a single, intuitive platform. This vision is now becoming a reality as OpenSea , the undisputed giant in the NFT space, unveils its groundbreaking OpenSea app . This isn’t just an update; it’s a complete reimagining of the crypto experience, designed to bring unparalleled convenience and power directly to your fingertips. OpenSea App: A Game Changer for Digital Assets? In a significant move that signals a new era for digital asset management, OpenSea has officially launched its all-in-one mobile application. This strategic development aims to consolidate the fragmented world of Web3 into a seamless user experience. Traditionally, users would navigate separate platforms for NFT discovery, token swaps, and decentralized finance (DeFi) interactions. OpenSea’s new app seeks to revolutionize this by integrating these core functionalities under one roof. The announcement, as reported by Cointelegraph, highlights OpenSea’s ambition to move beyond its reputation solely as an NFT marketplace . The platform acquired mobile token trading service Rally, which played a crucial role in accelerating this initiative. Rally provided OpenSea with the technological infrastructure and expertise needed to enhance its mobile and token trading capabilities. This integration promises a more fluid and efficient way for users to interact with their digital assets, from browsing the latest NFT collections to managing their cryptocurrency portfolios and participating in DeFi opportunities. Beyond the NFT Marketplace: Embracing DeFi Integration The crypto landscape is constantly evolving, and the lines between different sectors like NFTs, fungible tokens, and DeFi are blurring. OpenSea’s decision to embrace comprehensive DeFi integration within its new app is a testament to this trend. This move positions OpenSea not just as a place to buy and sell digital art, but as a central hub for all things crypto. What does this mean for the average user? Simplified Access: No more switching between MetaMask, Uniswap, and OpenSea. Users can potentially manage their assets, swap tokens, and explore DeFi protocols directly within the OpenSea app. Enhanced Portfolio Management: A unified view of all digital assets, including NFTs and various tokens, providing a holistic understanding of one’s crypto wealth. New Opportunities: Integration with DeFi features could open doors to staking, lending, and borrowing directly from the app, offering users more ways to utilize their crypto holdings. This strategic pivot is designed to attract a broader user base, including those primarily interested in token trading or DeFi, while retaining its loyal NFT community. The goal is to provide a truly comprehensive crypto experience that caters to diverse needs. Elevating Your Crypto Experience: What to Expect So, what can users truly expect from this revamped platform designed to elevate their crypto experience ? The focus is clearly on user-friendliness, security, and a robust feature set. OpenSea aims to provide a platform where both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and newcomers can navigate the complex world of Web3 with ease. Key features likely to be part of this integrated experience include: Feature Category Description Benefit to User NFT Management Browse, buy, sell, and manage your NFT collections with enhanced filters and discovery tools. Streamlined access to the world’s largest NFT marketplace. Token Trading Seamlessly swap various cryptocurrencies directly within the app, powered by Rally’s technology. Convenience and efficiency for portfolio adjustments and liquidity management. DeFi Interaction Access select DeFi protocols for activities like staking, lending, or yield farming. (Specifics TBD by OpenSea) New avenues for earning passive income and maximizing crypto assets. Wallet Integration Securely connect and manage multiple crypto wallets within the app. Centralized control over digital assets. Real-time Data Access to live market data, price charts, and portfolio performance tracking. Informed decision-making and better asset management. The success of this comprehensive approach will heavily depend on the seamlessness of these integrations and the platform’s ability to maintain high security standards, which is paramount in the crypto space. The Future of Web3 Innovation: OpenSea’s Vision OpenSea’s latest move is more than just a product launch; it’s a bold statement about the future of Web3 innovation . By bringing together NFTs, tokens, and DeFi, OpenSea is positioning itself as a central gateway to the decentralized internet. This holistic approach aligns with the broader industry trend of creating more integrated and user-friendly Web3 environments. The vision is clear: to onboard the next billion users into Web3 by removing friction points and offering a unified, accessible platform. This could significantly impact how individuals interact with decentralized applications (dApps), manage their digital identities, and participate in the creator economy. Challenges, however, remain. Competition from other integrated platforms, regulatory uncertainties, and the inherent complexities of Web3 technology will test OpenSea’s resolve. Yet, with its dominant market position in NFTs and a clear strategic direction, OpenSea is well-equipped to lead this charge. Seamless Token Trading: A New Era for Users One of the most anticipated features of the new OpenSea app is its promise of seamless token trading . The acquisition of Rally was a strategic masterstroke, specifically aimed at bolstering this capability. Rally’s expertise in mobile-first token trading means users can expect a highly optimized experience for buying, selling, and swapping various cryptocurrencies directly within the OpenSea ecosystem. This integration aims to eliminate the need for users to transfer funds between different platforms, reducing gas fees and potential security risks associated with multiple transactions. For NFT collectors, this means they can more easily acquire the specific tokens needed for purchases or convert earnings from NFT sales into other cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. For token traders, it offers a new, potentially more convenient venue for their activities, integrated with their NFT portfolio. The success of this feature will hinge on competitive trading fees, liquidity, and the range of supported tokens. If OpenSea can deliver a truly efficient and cost-effective trading experience, it could significantly enhance its value proposition to a wider audience. Actionable Insights for Users: Explore Early: Download the OpenSea app as soon as it’s available in your region to get a first look at the new features. Start Small: If you’re new to DeFi or token trading, begin with small transactions to familiarize yourself with the interface and functionalities. Security First: Always ensure you are downloading the official OpenSea app from legitimate app stores. Be wary of phishing attempts. Provide Feedback: OpenSea will likely be iterating rapidly.

The news was shared in a letter sent to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Notably, this is an important step for ProShares and the XRP market. Structure of ProShares’ UXRP ProShares, known for launching the first U.S. Bitcoin futures ETF in 2021, is now adding more products focused on altcoins. The UXRP ETF will track XRP futures contracts instead of the spot price. This lets investors predict future XRP prices while benefiting from the safety of a traditional ETF structure. Although the exact launch date is not confirmed, many speculate that the UXRP ETF could start trading as soon as this week. If it launches, it will be the first futures-based XRP ETF for U.S. investors. This ETF would provide a regulated and accessible way to gain exposure to XRP price changes without holding the asset directly. Meanwhile, the approval comes at a time when interest in the crypto sector is growing. XRP has seen more attention after Ripple’s legal victory against the SEC, which clarified XRP’s regulatory issues. ProShares Trust Launches XRP ETFs Recall that the popular investment company launched its XRP ETF offerings in April 2025. ProShares’ XRP ETF provides investors a new way to gain exposure to XRP without directly buying the token. As reported by TheCoinRise, ProShares Trust will offer several XRP-focused ETFs, including the ProShares UltraShort XRP ETF, ProShares Ultra XRP ETF, and the Short XRP ETF. The registration papers indicate that the XRP ETFs are established under a mutual fund framework and comply with the Securities Act and the Investment Company Act rules. It is worth noting that ProShares Trust is known for offering investment products linked to digital assets. This new move aligned with its broader strategy to expand into the crypto sector. Many Still Await The Approval of Spot XRP ETF The crypto community is still anticipating the approval of a spot XRP ETF. Nevertheless, the ProShares XRP ETFs will provide investors with leveraged and inverse exposure to XRP’s price movements. This means investors can benefit from both the rise and fall of XRP prices through regulated financial products. Market participants hope that the success of ProShares’ funds will bring more momentum toward approving spot XRP ETFs soon. Since the Brazilian regulatory agency became the first to approve spot XRP ETFs , many hope that U.S. authorities will follow suit.

For anyone invested in the volatile realm of cryptocurrencies, or indeed any global asset, understanding the implications of a strengthening dollar is not just important, it’s absolutely crucial. Historically, a stronger dollar can put downward pressure on risk assets, including digital currencies, as investors might opt for the perceived safety and higher yields offered by dollar-denominated assets. This forecast isn’t just about currency exchange rates; it’s a signal that could reshape investment strategies and market sentiment across the board. Let’s delve into what BofA Securities is seeing and what it could mean for your financial future. Understanding the BofA Securities Forecast: Why USD Uptrends are Forming BofA Securities, a major player in global financial analysis, isn’t just making a casual observation; their forecast on USD uptrends is based on a meticulous examination of macroeconomic indicators and market dynamics. Their analysts point to several key factors that are converging to create a robust environment for dollar appreciation. At the heart of their thesis is the persistent resilience of the U.S. economy, which continues to outperform many of its global counterparts. While other major economies grapple with slower growth, persistent inflation, or geopolitical headwinds, the U.S. has shown remarkable adaptability, driven by strong labor markets and consumer spending. Another significant pillar supporting BofA’s outlook is the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance. Even as other central banks consider or begin easing, the Fed has maintained a relatively hawkish posture, keeping interest rates elevated to combat inflation. This creates a compelling interest rate differential, making dollar-denominated assets more attractive to international investors seeking higher returns. This ‘carry trade’ dynamic naturally increases demand for the dollar, pushing its value higher. Furthermore, in times of global uncertainty, the U.S. Dollar often acts as a safe-haven currency. When geopolitical tensions flare or economic instability looms elsewhere, capital tends to flow into the perceived safety of U.S. treasuries and dollar assets, reinforcing the dollar’s strength. BofA’s analysis also considers technical indicators, which are signaling bullish patterns for the dollar. Chart formations, momentum indicators, and trend lines are all aligning to suggest a sustained upward trajectory. This combination of fundamental economic strength, supportive monetary policy, safe-haven demand, and positive technical signals paints a comprehensive picture of an environment ripe for significant USD uptrends . Understanding these foundational elements is the first step in preparing for the potential shifts in the global financial landscape. The Mechanics Behind Dollar Strength: What’s Fueling the Surge? To truly grasp the implications of BofA’s forecast, it’s essential to understand the underlying mechanisms that contribute to dollar strength . It’s not just a random fluctuation; it’s a complex interplay of economic forces. Here’s a breakdown of the primary drivers: Interest Rate Differentials: Perhaps the most direct driver. When the Federal Reserve maintains higher interest rates compared to other major central banks (like the European Central Bank or the Bank of Japan), it makes dollar-denominated bonds and other financial instruments more attractive. International investors flock to these higher-yielding assets, increasing demand for the dollar to purchase them. This simple economic principle creates a powerful gravitational pull for capital towards the U.S. Economic Divergence: The U.S. economy has repeatedly demonstrated its resilience. Strong employment figures, robust consumer spending, and technological innovation continue to drive growth. In contrast, many European economies face structural challenges, and China’s post-pandemic recovery has been uneven. This divergence in economic performance makes the U.S. a more appealing destination for foreign direct investment and portfolio flows, further bolstering dollar strength . Global Risk Aversion (Safe-Haven Demand): In periods of geopolitical instability, economic uncertainty, or financial market turmoil, investors typically seek safety. The U.S. Dollar, backed by the world’s largest economy and deepest capital markets, is universally regarded as the premier safe-haven currency. When crises emerge, funds rapidly flow into dollar assets, regardless of interest rate differentials, simply for security. This flight to quality provides a consistent floor and potential surge capacity for the dollar. Monetary Policy Outlook: The Federal Reserve’s communication and actions regarding inflation and economic growth are pivotal. If the Fed signals a longer period of ‘higher for longer’ interest rates, or if it indicates a slower pace of rate cuts than its peers, it reinforces the perception of sustained dollar strength . Market expectations about future monetary policy are powerful determinants of currency movements. These factors often reinforce each other, creating a virtuous cycle for the dollar. For instance, strong economic data might prompt the Fed to maintain higher rates, which then attracts more capital, further strengthening the dollar. This feedback loop is what BofA Securities is observing and projecting forward. Navigating the Forex Market: Implications for Global Currencies and Commodities A strengthening dollar doesn’t operate in isolation; its ascent sends ripples throughout the entire Forex market and beyond, significantly impacting other major currencies and commodity prices. For investors, understanding these interconnected effects is paramount for strategic positioning. When the dollar gains ground, it typically means other currencies are losing value against it. Here’s how this plays out: EUR/USD: The Euro, as the second most traded currency, often bears the brunt of dollar strength. A stronger dollar makes European exports cheaper for U.S. buyers but makes U.S. goods more expensive for Europeans. This can weigh on European economic growth and potentially encourage the European Central Bank to consider more accommodative policies, further widening the interest rate differential with the U.S. GBP/USD: Sterling often follows a similar trajectory to the Euro. Economic challenges in the UK, coupled with a potentially less hawkish Bank of England compared to the Fed, can lead to a weaker pound against a surging dollar. USD/JPY: The Japanese Yen has been particularly susceptible to dollar strength due to the Bank of Japan’s ultra-loose monetary policy, maintaining negative interest rates while other central banks hike. This vast interest rate differential makes the Yen an attractive funding currency for carry trades, where investors borrow in Yen and invest in higher-yielding dollar assets, pushing the Yen lower. The impact extends to commodities as well, given that most global commodities are priced in U.S. Dollars: Gold: Often seen as an inverse relationship. A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of other currencies, reducing demand. Additionally, a rising dollar often correlates with higher real interest rates, which increases the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold. This can put significant downward pressure on gold prices. Oil: Similarly, a stronger dollar makes oil more expensive for countries that pay in other currencies, potentially dampening global demand and thus prices. However, oil prices are also heavily influenced by supply-demand dynamics and geopolitical events, which can sometimes counteract dollar strength. Other Commodities: Industrial metals, agricultural products, and other raw materials priced in dollars will also become more expensive for international buyers, potentially leading to reduced demand and price corrections. Navigating the Forex market during a period of dollar appreciation requires careful attention to these cross-asset dynamics. It’s not just about one currency pair; it’s about understanding the cascading effects across the entire financial ecosystem. How USD Uptrends Influence the Global Economy and Your Portfolio The implications of USD uptrends extend far beyond just currency exchange rates, permeating the very fabric of the global economy and directly influencing various asset classes within your investment portfolio. For investors, particularly those in the cryptocurrency space, understanding these broader effects is vital for informed decision-making. Impact on the Global Economy: Trade and Competitiveness: A strong dollar makes U.S. exports more expensive and imports cheaper. While this benefits U.S. consumers through lower import costs, it can hurt American companies that rely on exports, potentially impacting corporate earnings and GDP growth. Conversely, it can make non-U.S. exports more competitive in global markets. Inflation Dynamics: Cheaper imports due to a strong dollar can help temper inflation within the U.S. by reducing the cost of imported goods. However, for countries whose currencies are weakening against the dollar, the cost of dollar-denominated imports (like oil) rises, potentially fueling their domestic inflation. Emerging Markets: This is where the impact can be most severe. Many emerging market countries and corporations have significant dollar-denominated debt. A stronger dollar makes it more expensive for them to service these debts, increasing the risk of defaults and financial instability. It can also lead to capital outflows from these economies as investors chase higher yields in dollar assets. Corporate Earnings: U.S. multinational corporations that derive a significant portion of their revenue from overseas operations will see their foreign earnings translate into fewer dollars when repatriated, potentially impacting their reported profits. Impact on Your Portfolio: For investors, particularly those holding diversified portfolios, USD uptrends necessitate a review of asset allocation: Equities: U.S. equities, especially those with significant domestic exposure, might benefit from the relative strength of the U.S. economy. However, as noted, multinationals could face headwinds. Non-U.S. equities might become cheaper for dollar-based investors, but their underlying companies could face challenges if their local currency is weakening significantly. Bonds: U.S. Treasury bonds remain attractive due to their safety and relatively higher yields. However, if the dollar’s strength is driven by rising U.S. interest rates, existing bond prices could fall. Cryptocurrencies: This is a critical area for many readers. Historically, there has often been an inverse correlation between the U.S. Dollar and Bitcoin, and by extension, the broader crypto market. When the dollar strengthens, it often signals a ‘risk-off’ environment, leading investors to pull capital from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies and move into safer, dollar-denominated assets. This can lead to downward pressure on crypto prices. Additionally, if the dollar is strong due to high U.S. interest rates, the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding digital assets increases. While crypto markets have their own unique drivers (halvings, adoption, regulatory news), macro factors like USD uptrends are undeniable influences. A sustained period of dollar strength could pose headwinds for crypto valuations, making it essential for investors to monitor these trends closely. Understanding these intricate connections is key to making informed decisions and adapting your investment strategy to the prevailing macro environment. Preparing for the Future: Actionable Insights on the Currency Outlook Given the BofA Securities forecast for sustained currency outlook shifts driven by dollar strength, what actionable steps can investors take to prepare their portfolios and mitigate potential risks, especially within the volatile cryptocurrency space? Proactive planning is always better than reactive scrambling. Strategies for Navigating a Strong Dollar Environment: Diversification Across Asset Classes: While a strong dollar might put pressure on some assets, others could benefit. Consider diversifying beyond just crypto into traditional assets that historically perform well during periods of dollar strength, such as certain U.S. equities (particularly those with domestic revenue focus) or U.S. Treasury bonds. Review International Exposure: If you hold investments in non-U.S. companies or funds, understand their currency exposure. A weakening local currency against the dollar could erode your returns when converted back to USD. This might be a time to re-evaluate the risk-reward of such holdings. Consider Hedging Strategies: For sophisticated investors with significant international exposure or those looking to protect crypto holdings from dollar strength, hedging instruments might be an option. This could involve using currency futures, options, or inverse ETFs designed to benefit from a stronger dollar or weaker foreign currencies. However, these come with their own risks and complexities. Focus on Strong Fundamentals in Crypto: In a ‘risk-off’ environment induced by dollar strength, lower-quality or highly speculative crypto assets are often the first to suffer. Focus on projects with strong underlying technology, clear utility, robust development teams, and sustainable tokenomics. These projects may be more resilient during market downturns. Dollar-Cost Averaging: For long-term crypto investors, a strong dollar and potentially lower crypto prices could present an opportunity for dollar-cost averaging, allowing you to accumulate more assets at a lower average price over time. This strategy mitigates the risk of trying to time the market. Monitor Key Economic Indicators: Stay informed about economic data releases (inflation, GDP, employment), Federal Reserve statements, and geopolitical developments. These are the primary drivers of the currency outlook and can provide early signals for shifts in dollar strength. Maintain Liquidity: In uncertain times, having a portion of your portfolio in highly liquid assets (like stablecoins or short-term U.S. Treasury bills) allows you to capitalize on opportunities or weather downturns without being forced to sell assets at unfavorable prices. The currency outlook , particularly for the U.S. Dollar, is a dynamic and multifaceted issue. While BofA Securities points to compelling reasons for continued uptrends, markets are always subject to change. Remaining agile and informed will be your greatest asset. Challenges and Counterarguments: What Could Derail the Dollar’s Ascent? While BofA Securities presents a compelling case for sustained USD uptrends , it’s crucial for any astute investor to consider the potential counterarguments and challenges that could derail the dollar’s ascent. No market forecast is absolute, and various factors could shift the momentum. A Dovish Federal Reserve Pivot: The primary driver of dollar strength has been the Fed’s relatively hawkish stance. If U.S. inflation cools faster than expected, or if the U.S. economy faces a significant downturn (e.g., a recession), the Fed might be compelled to cut interest rates more aggressively than anticipated. Such a pivot would reduce the interest rate differential, making dollar assets less attractive and potentially leading to significant dollar weakness. Unexpected Global Economic Rebound: Should other major economies, particularly the Eurozone or China, experience a stronger-than-expected recovery, it could reduce the economic divergence that currently favors the U.S. Stronger growth elsewhere could attract capital away from the dollar and into other currencies, diminishing its relative appeal. De-escalation of Geopolitical Tensions: If global geopolitical risks (e.g., conflicts, trade wars) significantly de-escalate, the demand for the dollar as a safe-haven asset could diminish. As risk appetite returns, investors might shift capital back into riskier assets or currencies previously shunned, weakening the dollar. U.S. Fiscal Concerns: While less immediate, long-term concerns about the U.S. national debt and fiscal deficits could eventually weigh on investor confidence in the dollar. Although the dollar’s reserve currency status provides significant resilience, sustained fiscal imbalances could become a factor over time. Coordination Among Central Banks: While unlikely in the short term, a coordinated effort by major central banks to de-emphasize the dollar’s role in global trade or finance, perhaps in favor of a basket of currencies or alternative payment systems, could pose a long-term challenge. These counterarguments highlight the dynamic nature of currency markets. While the current momentum favors dollar strength, investors must remain vigilant and adaptable to changing macroeconomic landscapes and unforeseen events that could alter the currency outlook . Conclusion: Navigating the Powerful Waves of Dollar Strength The forecast from BofA Securities, signaling persistent USD uptrends , is a crucial piece of information for every investor, from traditional asset holders to those deeply immersed in the world of cryptocurrencies. This isn’t merely a technical market call; it’s a reflection of deep-seated macroeconomic forces at play, including the resilience of the U.S. economy, the Federal Reserve’s firm stance on interest rates, and the dollar’s enduring role as a global safe haven. Understanding the mechanisms behind dollar strength – from interest rate differentials to economic divergence – allows for a more informed approach to portfolio management. The implications of a surging dollar are far-reaching, impacting the entire Forex market , commodity prices, and the delicate balance of the global economy . For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, the historical inverse correlation between dollar strength and digital asset performance cannot be ignored. While crypto markets have their unique narratives, they are not immune to the powerful currents of global macroeconomics. The actionable insights provided, from strategic diversification and hedging to diligent monitoring of the currency outlook , offer a roadmap for navigating these potentially challenging yet opportunistic times. Ultimately, financial markets are an ever-evolving landscape. While BofA’s forecast provides a strong directional signal, staying informed, maintaining flexibility, and understanding the interconnectedness of global finance will be paramount. By recognizing the potential impact of a dominant dollar, investors can position themselves not just to weather the storm, but potentially to thrive amidst the powerful waves of currency shifts.

They pump hard, they pull back fast, and they often reward the boldest traders who spot them early. Right now, the market is showing serious signs of heating up again, and a handful of meme coins are leading the charge. Here are three tokens grabbing the spotlight this month. These aren’t just random pumps; they’ve got real momentum, engaged communities, and strong upside potential as Bitcoin gears up for its next leg. Whether you’re in it for the memes or the money, these projects deserve a spot on your radar. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) — the meme coin that’s actually building something big If there’s one meme coin that everyone seems to be talking about lately, it’s Little Pepe. But this isn’t just another frog-themed meme riding the Pepe trend; this project is doing something almost no other meme coin has dared to attempt. While most meme tokens focus on short-term hype, $LILPEPE is building its own Layer 2 blockchain on Ethereum. Let that sink in. A meme coin creating its own Layer 2 solution? That’s not just unusual—it’s borderline unheard of in this space. Currently priced at $0.0014 in its presale stage 5, Little Pepe has already raised over $5 million, with more than 4 billion tokens sold. But beyond those numbers, it’s the project’s unique roadmap that has crypto traders watching closely. The team has combined humor, functionality, and community incentives in a way that feels fresh. And here’s the kicker: $LILPEPE isn’t just relying on social media noise. It’s currently running a massive $777,000 giveaway—10 winners will each bag $77,000 worth of tokens. Naturally, this has sent its community into overdrive. But there’s more to it than giveaways. Every time Bitcoin rallies, Little Pepe sees spikes in wallet activity and transaction volume, showing a clear pattern of riding broader market sentiment while also creating its own momentum. Dogwifhat (WIF) — the Solana meme that won’t quit If you’ve spent any time in the crypto scene this year, you’ve definitely seen Dogwifhat—better known as $WIF. With its iconic pink-beanie-wearing dog mascot, this Solana-based meme coin has become the face of Solana’s meme movement. At its core, $WIF started like any other meme coin: goofy branding, viral Twitter posts, and a lot of speculative trading. But the difference? It stuck around. And now, it consistently pulls in daily volumes of over $200 million, with a market cap that comfortably sits among the top meme tokens. What makes $WIF really stand out is how closely it follows Bitcoin’s lead, albeit with more volatility. Every time Bitcoin rallies, $WIF tends to outperform it by a wide margin, as traders rush into meme plays with higher upside potential. Over the last few weeks, it bounced strongly from its recent lows, riding both Solana’s ecosystem growth and general market optimism. Floki (FLOKI) — the viking pup with real utility Floki isn’t new to the scene, but it’s proving that staying power is a superpower in crypto. Born from an Elon Musk tweet, Floki quickly turned into a household name among meme coin traders. Over the past year, Floki has built an ecosystem of products, from NFT metaverses like Valhalla to DeFi tools through FlokiFi. Recently, it regained traders’ attention after high-profile partnerships and exchange listings renewed interest. And it’s been moving in sync with Bitcoin’s rallies, often showing stronger percentage gains during bullish swings. Its price action indicates accumulation as traders build positions for a significant move. Floki appeals to meme coin traders and utility investors with strong liquidity, access to major exchanges, and a recognizable brand. Conclusion: Little Pepe could lead the next meme wave Dogwifhat and Floki have certainly earned their stripes in the meme coin world. Both have strong communities, rising prices, and serious market momentum—but neither feels quite as “early” as Little Pepe right now. What makes $LILPEPE stand out isn’t just its humor or viral memes—it’s the fact that it’s actually building something much bigger beneath the surface, between its Layer 2 blockchain plans, zero-tax trading, and that eye-popping $777,000 giveaway, this isn’t your typical meme project. It’s still in its presale phase, meaning those who spot it now are getting in at a stage where explosive upside is possible.

The country has experienced a surge in important aspects of the economy this month. Following analysis from the ZEW institute, the expectations index has soared significantly to 52.7 from 47.5 in June. This exceeded the 50.4 that economists in a survey had predicted. Additionally, a gauge of current conditions has increased. Germany’s economy shows a positive outlook even as economic uncertainty rises Germany’s economy boomed in the first three months, driven by a rush of demand as companies scrambled to cushion themselves from imminent US tariffs. Achim Wambach, president of the ZEW and a professor of economics at the University of Mannheim, commented on the development. According to Wambach, the respondents have a positive attitude. He then anticipated that a speedy resolution of the US-EU trade war and potential financial help from the German government’s next investment plan are behind people’s shift in morale. However, analysts estimate that growth may have stalled in the second quarter as the initial wave of orders fades. In addition, US President Donald Trump’s threat to impose 30% tariffs on the EU has added to uncertainty. Chancellor Friedrich Merz was concerned that this would disproportionately affect German exporters. Despite the current uncertainties regarding global trade tensions, almost two-thirds of experts expect the German economy to recover, Wambach said. Moreover, given that the survey was released on 14 July, it would not have captured the most recent US developments. Another indication that the nation is coping well with the impact of tariffs is that new data released on Tuesday, July 15, revealed that industrial production in the 20-nation euro zone rose by 1.7% from May to June, higher than analysts expected. In the meantime, the country’s first estimate of gross domestic product (GDP) is due on July 30, which will provide further evidence of the state of the economy. Katherina Reiche cautions about economic recovery in Germany According to the federal minister for economy and energy in Germany, Katherina Reiche, the German economy may fail to pick up significantly in the second three months of the year. The review followed months of volatility in production levels and company order volumes. For instance, chemical giant BASF SE has sharply cut its revenue forecast this year amid ongoing uncertainty in the industry. However, regardless of such struggles, German investors still have faith in the country’s economic development, something that has not been seen for several years, as per surveys conducted by sources. Germany’s economy shows signs of bouncing back strongly this year Following speculation from economists more optimistic about the country’s prospects, Germany’s economy is expected to bounce back massively this year after two years of contraction. The country may be about to get a break from its growth stagnation with some potential help from the government, which analysts forecast will grow 0.2% this year, rather than the stagnation they previously projected in May’s survey . Moreover, a 1.1% and 1.7% expansion is expected to be reached in 2026 and 2027, respectively, as the substantial ramp-ups of government outlays on infrastructure and defense kick in. According to a senior economist at the Handelsblatt Research Institute, Dennis Huchzermeier, some parts of the new federal government emergency programme are encouraging.

Here Is That Critical Price Point,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/how-much-higher-does-bitcoin-need-to-go-to-surpass-golds-market-cap-here-is-that-critical-price-point/,"Bitcoin reached an all-time high, reaching as high as $123,000. Following this historic surge, investors and analysts have begun to re-discuss the next big goal for the world's largest digital asset: reaching the market capitalization of gold. Currently, the price of Bitcoin is hovering around $117,252 and its total market capitalization is around $2.34 trillion. In comparison, gold's estimated total market capitalization is $23.13 trillion. This means Bitcoin currently represents only 10.09% of gold's market capitalization. Analysts estimate that for Bitcoin to “flip”—or surpass—gold's market capitalization, its price would need to rise to $1,161,767, representing an increase of approximately 890% from today's level. Related News: US President Donald Trump Makes Hot Remarks on Cryptocurrencies - Shares a Long Statement Bitcoin's long-term performance is increasing the number of investors who believe this goal is beyond imagination. While Bitcoin has gained over 1,168 percent in the last five years, gold's return has been only around 85 percent. Over the three-year period, Bitcoin has risen 470 percent, while gold's return has remained at 92 percent. This comparison paints a similar picture over the two-year, one-year, and three-month periods. For example, since the beginning of 2025, BTC has increased by approximately 25%, while gold has gained around 26%. However, in just the last three months, Bitcoin has gained over 38%, while gold has only gained around 3%. In the last month, Bitcoin has risen by more than 11%, while gold has lost 4%. There are also significant differences between the two assets on the supply side. Bitcoin's annual supply growth is around 0.83%, while gold's is estimated at around 1.72%. Furthermore, Bitcoin's halving mechanism, which occurs every four years, further reduces new supply, making the digital asset even more scarce. *This is not investment advice.

Both products offer 2x leveraged exposure to the performance of Solana and XRP, respectively, two of the world’s largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. #Solana News: @ProShares Ultra @solana ETF officially filed with #SEC .

ProShares Granted NYSE Arca Approval—Could XRP And SOL Trading Begin This Week? In an official announcement dated July 15, ProShares CEO Michael L. Sapir stated, “As cryptocurrencies become more widely adopted, investors are turning to platforms like Solana and XRP for exposure to next-generation blockchain technologies.” However, these ETFs do not hold cryptocurrencies directly. Instead, ProShares employs financial derivatives and debt instruments to amplify returns from the underlying assets. This structure means the SOL and XRP ETFs are designed to deliver daily returns that are double (2x) the benchmark’s price performance, magnifying both gains and losses. The launch follows ProShares’ receipt of approval for listing from the New York Stock Exchange Arca (NYSE Arca), as stated in a letter submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on July 14. NYSE Arca, one of the largest exchanges in the United States, has validated the product’s regulatory compliance and market readiness. The SEC has cleared ProShares to debut three XRP futures ETFs this week, though spot ETF applications are still pending. #ProShares #XRPETF https://t.co/B3UoTew2Ir — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 28, 2025 This development creates new opportunities for institutional investors to gain exposure to XRP and SOL through traditional stock market channels, offering a more accessible and regulated pathway compared to direct cryptocurrency trading. Additionally, futures-based crypto ETFs have historically secured regulatory approvals and commenced trading more rapidly than their spot counterparts. While the exact trading commencement date for SLON and UXRP remains unconfirmed, market observers have speculated that trading could begin as early as this week. This launch occurs within the context of a maturing cryptocurrency market, demonstrating the continued integration of digital assets into traditional financial infrastructure. Double Returns, Double Risk: What 2x Leverage Really Means For both Solana and Ripple, these ETFs could potentially enhance market liquidity and attract additional institutional capital from financial companies that have previously remained cautious due to volatility concerns and regulatory uncertainty. However, these investment vehicles carry inherent risks that cannot be overlooked. Given their objective of achieving double daily returns, the ETFs may experience heightened volatility amplification from underlying asset price fluctuations, particularly during periods of market instability. If we were able to document euphoria in a single chart, this could be one of them. Leveraged ETF exposure is at all-time highs, and the vast majority of that exposure is within leveraged long exposure. This amplifies tail risks if we see a meaningful drawdown as many would sell pic.twitter.com/DdYWWxkj4C — Markets & Mayhem (@Mayhem4Markets) November 30, 2024 Following the announcement, both XRP and SOL experienced price declines , with the Ripple-backed token falling 3.11% and Solana declining 3.96% over the same trading period. ProShares’ entry into leveraged XRP and Solana ETFs follows similar moves by other firms. In April, Teucrium launched the first XRP futures ETF , which recorded more than $5 million in trading volume on its debut day, marking the firm’s most successful product launch to date. Similarly, in March, Volatility Shares LLC introduced the first Solana ETFs : the Volatility Shares Solana ETF (SOLZ), which tracks Solana futures, and the Volatility Shares 2X Solana ETF (SOLT), offering leveraged exposure. ProShares’ Billion-Dollar Crypto ETF Empire ProShares has maintained a leadership position in the ETF space since 2006, currently managing over $85 billion in assets and offering one of the industry’s most comprehensive ETF lineups. The firm introduced cryptocurrency ETF offerings with the launch of the first U.S. bitcoin-linked ETF (BITO) in October 2021.

In January, ProShares submitted proposals for three XRP-based funds, including UXRP, a Short XRP ETF, and an Ultra Short XRP ETF.

About 10 days ago, two Bitcoin addresses that each had 10,000 BTC were each emptied within minutes of each other on the 4th of July. The two wallets had received their respective Bitcoin on April 3rd of 2011 when BTC was trading at $0.78 a piece. Then, last week, Coinbase director Conor Grogan suggested that the whale wallets could potentially be linked to a hack after finding that one of the wallets appears to have made a test transaction on the Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) network just hours before the big move happened, suggesting that whoever was responsible for the transfer was trying to go unnoticed. Now, according to pseudonymous crypto analyst Satoshi Stacker , one of the two whales is at it again, moving almost $5 billion worth of BTC to new wallets. “The 80,000 BTC whale has moved 40,000 BTC worth around $4.7 billion to new addresses. Around $2 billion of that BTC has then been transferred to centralized exchanges, likely to be sold. Are you buying this dip?” Source: Satoshi Stacker/X While the wallets were dormant since April of 2011, they also received trace amounts of Bitcoin during the intervening period, possibly due to dusting attacks conducted to try to sniff out the entities behind the addresses. Dusting attacks are typically conducted by researchers, law enforcement officials or criminals. The phenomenon of long-dormant addresses suddenly getting active spurs media interest due to their potential link to the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, who remains a mystery more than one and a half decades since the crypto king was introduced to the world. Bitcoin is trading for $117,195 at time of writing, a 2.2% decrease on the day.

According to CNBC, the final tally stood at 196-223, with 13 Republican representatives siding with Democrats to block the motion, marking a rare moment of dissent among House Republicans. House Rejects Key Crypto Legislation The proposed legislation included notable measures such as the GENIUS Act, which aimed to establish regulatory clarity for cryptocurrencies including stablecoins, which have gained notable traction over the past months among traditional firms. In light of the failed vote, House leadership has indicated plans to hold another vote later in the day. However, it remains uncertain whether this subsequent vote will address the same bills or if amendments will be made to appease those who opposed the original motion.

This $0.03 Token Could Be the Top Gainer Heading Into 2026,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-next-solana-sol-this-0-03-token-could-be-the-top-gainer-heading-into-2026/,"Solana (SOL)’s breakout from $25 to over $250 wasn’t luck. It was built on speed, throughput, and scalable infrastructure. The rise was fast—but calculated. Now, as the market turns its attention toward emerging projects with similar core architecture, a new contender is gaining serious traction: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Currently in Phase 5 of its presale, MUTM is priced at just $0.03, with over $12.2 million raised, 13,200+ holders, and 73% of tokens already sold at this tier. Only 27% remains before the next price jump to $0.035. As demand increases, investors are beginning to treat this DeFi-native protocol as more than a low-cap entry—it’s looking more like the Solana (SOL) of the lending space. Solana (SOL) vs Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Solana (SOL), a high-performance blockchain, faces several weaknesses despite its strengths in scalability and speed. Its primary issue is centralization concerns, as it relies on a smaller number of validator nodes compared to competitors like Ethereum, potentially compromising decentralization and security. High hardware requirements for running validators also limit participation, favoring well-resourced entities and raising barriers for smaller players. Network outages have been a recurring problem, with multiple incidents of downtime between 2021 and 2023, undermining reliability and user trust. Solana (SOL)’s consensus mechanism, while fast, is complex and can lead to vulnerabilities, such as spam attacks that have previously congested the network. Additionally, its ecosystem has faced criticism for hosting projects with questionable fundamentals, leading to scams and failures that damage its reputation. Finally, Solana (SOL)’s dependency on the Solana (SOL) Foundation for funding and development decisions creates risks of governance centralization, potentially alienating community-driven innovation and resilience Unlike Layer-1 systems that struggle with congestion and high gas costs, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being engineered directly for Layer-2 scalability. Its infrastructure is optimized for low-fee, high-throughput DeFi lending across two models: peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P). Both systems will benefit from real-time collateral monitoring and instant transaction execution—without bottlenecks. In the P2P model, users will be able to lend stablecoins to borrowers offering meme coins like DOGE, SHIB, or PEPE as collateral. Through direct smart contract automation, Mutuum ensures these transactions are executed securely, regardless of asset volatility. This opens new frontiers for non-traditional crypto holders to unlock liquidity, while lenders control interest rates and repayment terms with full transparency. At the center of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem lies its upcoming protocol-native decentralized stablecoin. This asset will always aim to remain pegged to $1, but unlike general-purpose stablecoins, it will only be minted when a user borrows against overcollateralized crypto like ETH or AVAX. When the loan is repaid or liquidated, the stablecoin will be automatically burned—ensuring that its supply expands and contracts in direct relation to real borrowing activity, preventing inflation and maintaining systemic balance. Minting rights will be restricted to approved issuers—smart contracts or addresses with strict caps—to limit systemic exposure. Interest rates for borrowing the stablecoin will be governed by on-chain governance and adjusted dynamically to support the peg. If the price strays from $1, these rates will shift accordingly, while arbitrage will add another layer of price alignment. This multi-layered mechanism of overcollateralization, rate control, and market-based incentives will keep the system stable and tightly pegged. Compounding Rewards with mtTokens Another core pillar of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem will be the mtToken architecture. These are ERC-20 tokens issued 1:1 when a user deposits an asset into a Mutuum lending pool. Over time, the mtTokens reflect both the original deposit and the accrued interest. They are not just passive receipts—they can be staked to earn additional dividends through protocol-generated revenue. This reward loop strengthens long-term engagement. Users not only collect lending yield but can also stake their mtTokens into designated smart contracts, receiving additional payouts in MUTM tokens sourced from platform earnings and buybacks. This creates a powerful blend of real yield and protocol-aligned incentives. Consider one early investor: after exiting their $10,000 Polkadot (DOT) position, they entered Phase 1 of the MUTM presale at $0.01 per token. With that entry, they secured 1,000,000 tokens. Now that Phase 5 is priced at $0.03, their holdings have already appreciated to $30,000, reflecting a 3x return before any exchange listing. Once the token goes live at the fixed $0.06 listing price, their position will be valued at $60,000, locking in a 6x gain compared to the original entry. Looking further ahead, analyst forecasts stretch much higher, projecting the price could reach $0.15 to $0.20 by 2026. At the upper end of that range, the same stake would be worth $200,000, delivering a potential 20x return as platform adoption accelerates across the DeFi world. Security and transparency remain top priorities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has undergone a full external audit by CertiK, earning a Token Scan Score of 95.00 and a Skynet Score of 77.5. A $50,000 bug bounty is also in place to attract white-hat developers and security testers. To supercharge adoption and reward early believers, the team has launched a $100,000 giveaway , targeting both new investors and community builders. On the roadmap ahead are key milestones: the Beta platform launch, Layer-2 integration, stablecoin deployment, and multi-chain expansion to increase protocol reach. Get In Before Phase 6 Sends It Higher Only 27% of tokens remain in Phase 5 at $0.03. Once they’re gone, the price increases 20% to $0.035, narrowing the entry window for latecomers. With a listing price of $0.06 already confirmed, even Phase 5 buyers are lined up for 2x gains, with much more on the table as adoption accelerates. While the next Solana (SOL) will take more than hype to succeed, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is showing all the structural traits needed: Layer-2 speed, real-world utility, passive income design, and a stablecoin architecture that ties everything together. As 2026 approaches, the question isn’t whether MUTM will rise—it’s how high it will go.

Since then, ETH has retraced by less than 5%, holding steady and showing signs of strength amid broader market volatility. The ability to maintain levels above $2,850 is being closely watched by traders and analysts as a potential launchpad for the next leg higher. Related Reading: Ethereum Supply Locked Hits New ATH: Smart Money Bets On Long-Term Growth Market sentiment remains increasingly optimistic, fueled by strong fundamentals and signs of institutional accumulation. According to on-chain data, SharpLink Gaming—one of the first Nasdaq-listed companies to develop a treasury strategy centered on Ethereum—purchased another $73,210,000 worth of ETH yesterday. This marks another strong signal that smart money is confident in Ethereum’s long-term value. As the crypto market awaits key developments from US regulators during “Crypto Week,” Ethereum’s price action and on-chain indicators remain aligned with a bullish outlook. If ETH can hold current levels and build momentum, the path toward $3,500 becomes increasingly realistic. With rising institutional demand and strong network fundamentals—including record ETH staking—Ethereum appears well-positioned to lead the next phase of the altcoin market rally. SharpLink Becomes Largest Public ETH Holder With $611M in Ethereum SharpLink Gaming has officially become the largest publicly known holder of Ethereum, with total holdings now reaching 205,634 ETH, valued at approximately $611 million. This milestone positions the Nasdaq-listed company at the forefront of institutional Ethereum adoption, setting a new benchmark for corporate treasury strategies in the crypto space. Top analyst Ted Pillows confirmed the latest purchase through on-chain data, revealing that the transaction originated from a Coinbase Prime hot wallet, commonly used by institutions for large-scale acquisitions. This move signals increasing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value, particularly as companies begin diversifying beyond Bitcoin to gain exposure to smart contract infrastructure. Ethereum’s technical setup remains strong, with price holding well above the $2,850 support zone following its recent move to $3,080. At the same time, fundamentals continue to improve. The ETH supply staked has reached new all-time highs, indicating that more long-term holders are locking up their assets rather than selling into strength. Combined with increased institutional interest, this reflects growing conviction in Ethereum’s role as a foundational layer for Web3. The coming weeks promise to be pivotal. With market sentiment turning bullish and Ethereum gaining traction in corporate circles, the stage is set for a sustained upward move, especially if broader macro and regulatory conditions remain favorable.

ETH Holds Above Key Breakout Zone Ethereum’s 3-day chart shows a bullish continuation pattern, with price currently holding at $2,978 after recently breaking through a critical resistance zone at $2,850. The breakout marked a shift in momentum following a prolonged consolidation phase and pushed ETH to a local high of $3,041.41. Although a slight retracement followed, the current structure remains strong as bulls successfully defend the $2,850–$2,900 area. This level is particularly important as it aligns with multiple technical indicators. The 200-day simple moving average (SMA) sits at $2,805.46, now acting as dynamic support. ETH also remains well above the 50-day and 100-day SMAs, currently at $2,244.80 and $2,661.68, confirming that the broader trend has turned bullish.

33767162,[object Object],1752609623,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Shiba Inu Breakout Programmed: Diamond Hands Are Up 783%, SHIB Burn Rate Explodes 1,784%",https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-breakout-programmed/,"Shiba Inu is beginning to show signs of a major breakout due to a rare alignment of on-chain signals and strong bullish sentiment. Over the past week, two powerful metrics, the average holding time and token burn rate, have spiked dramatically. These developments come as Shiba Inu’s price follows Bitcoin’s surge past $122,000 , lifting SHIB to a 30-day high of $0.00001391. SHIB Holders Show Commitment Shiba Inu investors are displaying stronger long-term conviction than at any other point in the current cycle. According to IntoTheBlock data , the average holding time of transacted SHIB tokens has increased by 783% in just the past seven days. This metric reflects how long SHIB coins were held before being moved on-chain, and such a quick increase indicates that most wallet holders are sitting on their tokens far longer than before. This aligns with the broader trend that the average holding time across all SHIB addresses now stands at 2.8 years, which is more than half of the token’s total lifetime. Even as SHIB touched a seven-week high of $0.0000139 during early Monday trading, the data shows that many holders are bracing for much higher price levels rather than selling into short-term rallies. This increase in diamond hands behavior is a strong bullish signal that often leads up to further major upside movement. SHIB Burn Rate Blows Past 1 Billion, Up 1,784% Adding to the bullish narrative is the concurrent increase in Shiba Inu’s burn rate. According to data from Shibburn , the Shiba Inu burn rate has seen a massive increase in the past seven days, with the number of tokens burned crossing the 1 billion threshold. Particularly, the burn data shows that 1,055,861,987 SHIB tokens have been removed from circulation in the past seven days alone, which translates to a 1,784.86% increase compared to the previous week. Furthermore, another 4,705,361 SHIB tokens were destroyed over the past 24 hours, pushing the daily burn rate up by 8.78%. Burning tokens reduces the available supply in the market, and when paired with rising demand or a strong holding mentality, it creates the ideal conditions for a supply squeeze. The current burn rate explosion shows increasing effort within the community to drive up scarcity at a time when SHIB’s market structure appears to be tilting bullish. Shiba Inu’s current price action supports the idea that a breakout is underway. The token has followed Bitcoin’s most recent bullish breakout to a new price peak of $122,838. Although this move saw the Shiba Inu price reach a 30-day high of $0.00001391, it has since corrected a bit alongside Bitcoin’s correction to $117,000. Nonetheless, CoinGecko price data shows that Shiba Inu is still up by 9.7% in a seven-day timeframe. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.000013.",Shiba Inu|bitcoin|CoinGecko|IntoTheBlock|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|Shibburn|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-07-15 20:00:23

Here’s The Latest,https://timestabloid.com/corporations-are-actively-adding-xrp-to-their-balance-sheets-heres-the-latest/,"A clear trend is emerging in July 2025: corporations are actively adding XRP to their balance sheets, marking a new chapter in institutional cryptocurrency adoption. This momentum, highlighted by crypto commentator SMQKE on X, shows that XRP is no longer on the sidelines; it is now part of serious corporate treasury strategies. Thumzup Leads the Charge with XRP Accumulation One of the most prominent examples of this shift comes from Thumzup Media Corporation, a Nasdaq-listed company specializing in programmatic advertising and digital branding. In a press release dated July 9, 2025, Thumzup announced that its Board of Directors had approved the accumulation of multiple leading cryptocurrencies, including XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LITE), Solana (SOL), Ether (ETH), and USD Coin (USDC). This expansion builds on Thumzup’s earlier Bitcoin acquisition strategy. As of July 8, the company holds 19.106 BTC, valued at approximately $2.1 million. The newly authorized resolution broadens that scope, empowering Thumzup to diversify its digital asset holdings beyond Bitcoin and reinforce its financial infrastructure. JULY 2025: CORPORATES ARE ACCUMULATING XRP ON THEIR BALANCE SHEETS Documented. pic.twitter.com/xSNt3j1Po0 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 15, 2025 Strategic Treasury Management and Digital Diversification Thumzup’s CEO, Robert Steele, emphasized that the move reflects both innovation and financial prudence. “Expanding our exploration into other leading cryptocurrencies aligns with our commitment to innovation and prudent treasury management,” Steele noted. “We believe that a diversified approach to digital assets could enhance our financial flexibility as we continue to scale our AdTech platform and grow our advertiser base.” This corporate mindset reflects a maturing approach to digital assets. Rather than treating cryptocurrencies purely as speculative investments, companies like Thumzup are now viewing them as strategic components of long-term financial planning. XRP Gains Ground Post-Regulatory Clarity A major factor fueling corporate interest in XRP is the regulatory clarity it has recently gained. Following a landmark legal ruling in 2023 , XRP is no longer classified as a security in secondary market transactions. This outcome concluded Ripple’s long legal standoff with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), giving institutional players the green light to hold XRP without fear of legal repercussions. This regulatory resolution has helped reframe XRP as one of the most credible digital assets on the market, especially for institutions looking to diversify beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Utility and Institutional Appeal Beyond legal clarity, XRP’s real-world utility is a key driver of corporate adoption. Ripple’s global payment network, including its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution and the RLUSD stablecoin, is transforming how businesses and banks handle cross-border transactions. XRP’s low cost, high speed , and energy efficiency make it uniquely positioned as a treasury asset for corporations operating in an increasingly digital global economy. For companies like Thumzup, XRP represents more than a bet on crypto; it’s a tool for navigating the future of finance. A Turning Point for XRP and Corporate Adoption As SMQKE observed, July 2025 may be remembered as a turning point for XRP’s institutional credibility. With firms like Thumzup now openly accumulating the asset, a clear signal has been sent to the broader market: XRP is no longer just for retail investors; it’s entering corporate vaults. As more companies recognize XRP’s potential for utility, stability, and diversification, its presence on corporate balance sheets is expected to grow, redefining the future of crypto adoption in the business world.

Two customers, Qun He and Haihui Zhang, filed a complaint against Merrill, Bank of America’s wealth management division, in late 2023, alleging the firm violated securities laws, industry standards and its fiduciary duty. The complainants also alleged the firm acted with negligence and negligent supervision and breached its contract related to various unspecified securities. Merrill Lynch denied the allegations. The U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) made an independent arbitration forum available, and a public panel of arbitrators decided Merrill Lynch should pay the claimants $2.73 million in compensatory damages, $2,002 in costs and $954,634 in attorneys’ fees. Michael Bixby, a Florida attorney who represented the two customers, tells AdvisorHub that a broker recommended investments in illiquid proprietary feeder funds sold by Merrill. Bixby says that the feeder funds pooled capital into private equity investments overseen by institutional investors such as Apollo Global Management, KKR and Blackstone. The lawyer says the recommended funds were advertised as having potential annual returns of 15% to 20%, but ended up recording annual returns around 3% after subtracting private equity fees and administrative charges from Merrill. “We’re pleased with the result, and we think it reflects the arbitrator’s decision that Merrill was responsible for misconduct and held them accountable.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The company, known for its focus on cybersecurity and data analytics, is venturing into the world of digital assets in a substantial way. This isn’t just a fleeting interest; it’s a calculated long-term play that underscores the growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. For anyone interested in the evolving landscape of corporate finance and digital assets, Cycurion’s entry marks a compelling moment. What is Cycurion Crypto and Why Does Its Formation Matter? Cycurion has formally established Cycurion Crypto , a wholly owned subsidiary dedicated to acquiring and holding Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as long-term investments. This isn’t a small-scale pilot project; the company plans an initial investment of $10 million into these crypto assets, leveraging a portion of its existing $60 million equity line of credit. This decision is more than just an allocation of capital; it represents a strategic pivot for a publicly traded company. The formation of a dedicated subsidiary like Cycurion Crypto signals a serious commitment. It suggests that Cycurion views digital assets not merely as speculative instruments but as legitimate components of a diversified corporate treasury strategy. By creating a separate entity, Cycurion can streamline its operations related to crypto asset management, potentially manage regulatory considerations more effectively, and clearly delineate its digital asset holdings from its core business operations. This structure can also provide transparency for shareholders regarding its crypto exposure. Why is Cycurion Making a Significant Bitcoin Acquisition? The decision to prioritize a substantial Bitcoin acquisition aligns with a growing trend among forward-thinking corporations. Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ has proven its resilience and value proposition over more than a decade. Companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Block have famously added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, viewing it as a superior store of value and a hedge against inflation and currency debasement. Here are some of the key reasons why a Bitcoin acquisition makes strategic sense for companies like Cycurion: Inflation Hedge: With its fixed supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is seen by many as a strong hedge against the inflationary pressures often associated with traditional fiat currencies. Digital Gold Narrative: As the world becomes increasingly digital, Bitcoin offers a decentralized, borderless alternative to physical gold, appealing to companies seeking modern asset diversification. Scarcity and Demand: The finite supply, combined with increasing institutional and retail demand, creates a compelling value proposition for long-term holding. First-Mover Advantage (for traditional companies): While not the absolute first, being an early adopter among Nasdaq-listed firms still offers a perceived advantage in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. Cycurion’s move suggests confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation and its role as a foundational digital asset in the global economy. This isn’t about short-term trading; it’s about securing a piece of what many believe will be a fundamental component of future financial systems. How Does Cycurion’s Ethereum Investment Bolster Its Digital Asset Portfolio? Beyond Bitcoin, Cycurion’s equally significant commitment to Ethereum investment highlights a nuanced understanding of the crypto ecosystem. While Bitcoin is primarily a store of value, Ethereum is the backbone of the decentralized internet, powering a vast array of applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and the broader Web3 movement. An Ethereum investment brings different, yet equally compelling, advantages to a corporate treasury: Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum’s network effect is immense. Its smart contract capabilities enable an entire universe of decentralized applications, indicating strong future growth potential as Web3 adoption expands. Yield Opportunities: While Cycurion’s immediate goal is long-term holding, Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) opens up possibilities for staking rewards, potentially generating passive income on their holdings in the future. Technological Innovation: Investing in ETH is investing in a platform that continuously innovates, driving forward the frontier of blockchain technology. Diversification within Crypto: Holding both BTC and ETH provides a diversified exposure to the two largest cryptocurrencies, capturing both the ‘store of value’ and ‘programmable money’ narratives. Cycurion’s dual approach to Bitcoin and Ethereum demonstrates a strategic understanding of the distinct roles these assets play in the digital economy. It’s not just about owning crypto; it’s about owning the foundational layers of the future digital financial system. Is This the Dawn of Widespread Institutional Crypto Adoption? Cycurion’s announcement is not an isolated incident but rather another strong indicator of accelerating institutional crypto adoption . For years, cryptocurrencies were viewed with skepticism by mainstream finance. However, as the market matured, regulatory clarity improved, and infrastructure developed, more and more traditional institutions are recognizing the potential of digital assets. The trend of institutional crypto adoption is driven by several factors: Maturing Market: Increased liquidity, better custody solutions, and regulated products (like Bitcoin ETFs) have made crypto more accessible and less risky for institutions. Competitive Pressure: As some companies successfully integrate crypto, others feel pressure to explore similar strategies to remain competitive and innovative. Investor Demand: A growing number of institutional and retail investors are demanding exposure to digital assets, prompting companies to respond. Macroeconomic Climate: Persistent inflation and low-interest rates in traditional markets make alternative assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum more attractive for yield and capital preservation. Cycurion’s move further legitimizes crypto as a viable asset class for corporate treasuries, potentially encouraging other companies on Nasdaq and beyond to follow suit. This could lead to a domino effect, where increasing corporate holdings contribute to greater market stability and broader acceptance. What Are the Key Considerations for a Robust Corporate Crypto Strategy? While Cycurion’s move is exciting, developing a sound corporate crypto strategy involves navigating a complex landscape of benefits and challenges. Companies considering a similar path need to undertake careful planning and due diligence. Benefits of a Corporate Crypto Strategy: Benefit Description Diversification Adds a non-correlated asset to the treasury, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Potential for Growth Exposure to a high-growth asset class with significant upside potential. Innovation & Brand Image Positions the company as forward-thinking and technologically savvy, potentially attracting new talent and customers. Inflation Hedge Provides a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Challenges and Considerations for a Corporate Crypto Strategy: Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their price swings, which can impact financial statements. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape is still evolving, posing potential risks for compliance and future operations. Custody and Security: Securely storing digital assets requires specialized expertise and robust security measures to prevent hacks or loss. Accounting and Tax Implications: Managing crypto on the balance sheet involves complex accounting standards and tax reporting requirements. Shareholder Reaction: Explaining the rationale and managing potential skepticism from shareholders. Actionable Insights for Companies: Start Small: Begin with a manageable allocation to test the waters and gain experience. Due Diligence: Thoroughly research the chosen assets, their underlying technology, and market dynamics. Secure Custody: Partner with reputable institutional-grade custodians or implement robust self-custody solutions. Legal and Regulatory Counsel: Engage experts to navigate the evolving legal and tax implications. Transparent Communication: Clearly articulate the strategy and its rationale to stakeholders. Risk Management: Implement a comprehensive risk management framework, including potential hedging strategies. Cycurion’s decision reflects a calculated risk, but one that is increasingly being embraced by corporate leaders who see the long-term value and disruptive potential of digital assets. Cycurion’s formation of Cycurion Crypto and its strategic $10 million investment in Bitcoin and Ethereum represents a significant milestone. It’s a clear signal that publicly traded companies are increasingly viewing cryptocurrencies as legitimate, long-term assets for their balance sheets, rather than mere speculative plays. This bold move not only positions Cycurion at the forefront of corporate innovation in the digital age but also contributes to the broader trend of institutional crypto adoption. As more companies explore similar strategies, the integration of digital assets into mainstream finance will only accelerate, reshaping the future of corporate treasuries and investment portfolios worldwide.

MP Materials’ shares responded positively to the development. They surged about 24% on the news, while Apple’s stock edged slightly higher. MP Materials’ Fort Worth to start shipments in 2027 Under the deal, Apple will purchase rare‑earth magnets produced at MP Materials’ Fort Worth, Texas, plant. The Texas facility, which processes minerals into powerful magnets used in everything from smartphones to electric vehicles, is slated to begin shipments in 2027. That timeline aligns with both companies’ long‑term strategy to localize critical technology inputs and reduce reliance on overseas suppliers. In a statement, Apple CEO Tim Cook said, “American innovation drives everything we do at Apple, and we’re proud to deepen our investment in the US economy.” “Rare earth materials are essential for making advanced technology, and this partnership will help strengthen the supply of these vital materials here in the United States.” Cook. Beyond sourcing new magnets, Apple and MP Materials will collaborate on a rare‑earth recycling line at the Mountain Pass mine in California. That facility, currently America’s only operating rare‑earth mine, will process end‑of‑life electronics and other waste to recover and reuse these valuable metals. Through turning discarded devices into fresh material, the companies aim to support Apple’s long‑standing goal of eventually eliminating its dependence on traditional mining. MP Materials expects the recycling line to ramp up alongside the Fort Worth plant, ensuring a steady domestic flow of rare‑earth inputs for Apple’s products. “MP Materials and Apple will also innovate together to accelerate technological advancements in magnet production, as well as end-of-life recovery.” MP Materials. Over the past few years, the US government and private sector have made concerted efforts to reduce dependence on China , which historically has controlled the majority of the global rare‑earth elements market. Earlier this month, the Department of Defense became the largest shareholder in MP Materials by injecting $400 million in preferred stock, an investment designed to shore up America’s magnet supply. The deal makes perfect sense for Apple Apple’s move is part of a broader pledge to invest more than $500 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next four years. Already this year, the company announced plans for a new AI‑server factory in Texas and other expansions designed to bring more production stateside. Market watchers note that MP Materials’ stock has nearly quadrupled since January, boosting its market value to nearly $10 billion. In the past month alone, the shares have almost doubled, reflecting growing investor confidence in the company’s role in reshaping the rare‑earth landscape. According to Apple, the agreement will create dozens of new manufacturing, research, and development positions across both facilities. That lift in employment underscores the pact’s economic impact beyond high‑tech supply chains. Bob O’Donnell, president of TECHnalysis Research , said the deal “makes complete sense” for Apple, given its heavy use of rare‑earth magnets in phones, tablets, and wearables “Sourcing domestically does help position Apple more positively in Washington, especially as companies align with US industrial policy.” O’Donnell. While Apple has faced political pressure to produce more iPhones in America, analysts caution that full-scale smartphone assembly in the US remains challenging due to higher labour costs and entrenched supply networks abroad.

Imagine a Nasdaq-listed company, known for its gaming solutions, making a massive bet on digital assets. That’s precisely what SharpLink Gaming has done, announcing an unprecedented move that has solidified its position as the largest corporate holder of Ethereum (ETH). This isn’t just another crypto headline; it’s a powerful statement about the evolving landscape of corporate treasury strategies and the growing confidence in decentralized finance. What Just Happened? SharpLink Gaming’s Audacious ETH Acquisition In a move that sent ripples across the crypto and traditional finance sectors, SharpLink Gaming, a company listed on Nasdaq, recently unveiled its aggressive treasury strategy focused on Ethereum . Between July 7 and July 13, the company acquired an astonishing 74,656 ETH. This significant purchase was made at an average price of $2,852 per ETH, totaling approximately $213 million. This latest acquisition isn’t just a one-off; it boosts SharpLink’s total ETH holdings to a staggering 280,706 ETH. To put this into perspective, consider the scale: New Acquisition: 74,656 ETH (valued at ~$213 million) Total Holdings: 280,706 ETH Average Acquisition Price (recent): $2,852 Company Status: Nasdaq-listed, gaming solutions provider This strategic accumulation positions SharpLink Gaming as a frontrunner in corporate digital asset adoption, setting a new benchmark for how public companies might view and integrate cryptocurrencies into their balance sheets. It’s a bold play that underscores a deep conviction in the future of the Ethereum ecosystem. Why Are Companies Embracing Corporate Crypto? The Rise of Institutional Adoption SharpLink Gaming’s decision isn’t an isolated incident but rather a prominent example of a growing trend: institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. For years, crypto was largely seen as a retail-driven phenomenon, or perhaps the domain of niche tech firms. However, as the digital asset space matures, more and more traditional companies are exploring the benefits of holding cryptocurrencies as part of their treasury reserves. So, what’s driving this shift? Several factors are at play: Inflation Hedge: In an era of economic uncertainty and rising inflation, some companies view cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum as potential stores of value that can protect against currency debasement. Diversification: Adding digital assets provides diversification away from traditional fiat currencies and conventional investments, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Web3 Integration: For companies like SharpLink Gaming, which operates in the tech and entertainment sectors, holding native assets of Web3 platforms (like ETH for the Ethereum blockchain) can be a strategic move to prepare for or integrate into the decentralized internet. Growth Potential: Despite volatility, the long-term growth potential of leading cryptocurrencies remains a significant draw for forward-thinking corporations. Brand Innovation: Embracing digital assets can also signal a company’s commitment to innovation and forward-thinking strategies, potentially appealing to a new generation of investors and customers. While MicroStrategy famously led the charge with Bitcoin, SharpLink’s focus on Ethereum highlights a broadening interest beyond just Bitcoin, signaling confidence in the smart contract platform’s utility and ecosystem. SharpLink Gaming’s Vision: More Than Just a Bet on ETH Holdings SharpLink Gaming isn’t just buying Ethereum ; they’re implementing a deliberate treasury strategy. This implies a thoughtful approach to managing corporate assets, leveraging ETH not merely as a speculative investment but potentially as a foundational element for future business operations or strategic positioning. What does a ‘treasury strategy focused on Ethereum’ truly mean for a gaming company? Future-Proofing Business Models: As gaming increasingly converges with Web3 technologies (NFTs, play-to-earn, metaverse), holding significant amounts of ETH could be a strategic advantage, enabling seamless integration with decentralized applications and blockchain-based gaming platforms. Participating in the Ecosystem: Holding ETH allows direct participation in the Ethereum ecosystem, whether through staking, engaging with DeFi protocols, or potentially funding future Web3 initiatives directly from their treasury. Long-Term Value Creation: This move signals a belief in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition, not just as a digital currency but as the backbone of a global, decentralized computing platform. This strategic pivot by SharpLink Gaming could serve as a blueprint for other companies looking to future-proof their operations and capitalize on the burgeoning digital economy. It’s a testament to the belief that digital assets are no longer a fringe investment but a core component of a modern, resilient treasury. Navigating the Waters: Challenges and Considerations for Corporate Crypto While the benefits of corporate crypto adoption are compelling, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and risks involved. SharpLink Gaming, like any pioneer, must navigate a complex landscape: Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their price swings. A significant drop in ETH’s value could impact SharpLink’s balance sheet and investor sentiment. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving across different jurisdictions. Changes in regulations could affect the value or usability of their ETH holdings. Security and Custody: Safely storing such a large amount of digital assets requires robust security measures and reliable custody solutions to prevent hacks or loss. Accounting Treatment: How digital assets are treated for accounting and tax purposes can be complex and varies by region, requiring specialized expertise. Public Perception: While many celebrate this move, some traditional investors might view it as too risky or outside a gaming company’s core business, potentially impacting stock performance. SharpLink’s ability to manage these risks will be key to the long-term success of its Ethereum treasury strategy. Their transparency about the acquisition, announced via X, suggests a confident approach to communicating their strategy to stakeholders. What Does This Mean for the Future of Institutional Adoption? SharpLink Gaming’s bold move could have far-reaching implications for the broader landscape of institutional adoption . When a Nasdaq-listed company makes such a significant public investment in Ethereum , it sends a powerful signal: Increased Legitimacy: It further legitimizes cryptocurrencies as a viable asset class for corporate treasuries, potentially encouraging other public companies to follow suit. Demand for ETH: Large-scale acquisitions by corporations create sustained demand for ETH, which could influence its price trajectory and market stability. Broader Ecosystem Development: As more companies hold ETH, it could accelerate the development of enterprise-grade solutions on the Ethereum blockchain, fostering innovation. Investor Confidence: It demonstrates confidence in Ethereum’s underlying technology and its long-term potential, which could positively influence both institutional and retail investor sentiment. This isn’t just about SharpLink; it’s about a growing acceptance of digital assets within mainstream finance. The ripple effect of such a significant corporate investment could pave the way for a new wave of capital flowing into the crypto market. Actionable Insights: What Can We Learn from SharpLink’s ETH Holdings? SharpLink Gaming’s strategy offers valuable insights for both individual investors and other businesses contemplating a dive into the crypto world: For Investors: Pay attention to corporate treasury strategies. These large-scale, long-term investments by public companies can indicate strong fundamental belief in an asset’s future, often backed by extensive research and risk assessment. It also highlights the growing institutional demand for assets like Ethereum. For Businesses: Do Your Due Diligence: Understand the technology, market dynamics, and regulatory landscape thoroughly before committing. Define Your Strategy: Is it for diversification, Web3 integration, or speculative growth? A clear strategy is crucial. Prioritize Security: Implement robust security protocols and consider institutional-grade custody solutions for digital assets. Seek Expert Advice: Consult with legal, financial, and tax experts specializing in cryptocurrencies to navigate the complexities. SharpLink’s proactive stance serves as a compelling case study for how traditional businesses can strategically integrate digital assets into their financial frameworks, positioning themselves for future growth in a rapidly evolving digital economy. Conclusion: A New Horizon for Corporate Finance SharpLink Gaming’s monumental acquisition of Ethereum marks a significant milestone in the journey of institutional adoption of digital assets. By becoming the largest corporate holder of ETH, SharpLink has not only made a bold statement about its treasury strategy but has also underscored the growing confidence among public companies in the long-term viability and strategic importance of cryptocurrencies. This move signals a profound shift in corporate finance, where digital assets are increasingly seen not as speculative curiosities, but as essential components of a forward-looking balance sheet. As the lines between traditional finance and the decentralized world continue to blur, SharpLink Gaming’s pioneering spirit could inspire many more to explore the vast potential that Ethereum and the broader crypto market have to offer. The future of corporate treasuries is undoubtedly becoming more digital, and SharpLink is leading the charge.

The congresswoman further criticized the bills as potential vehicles that would “legalize the unprecedented crypto corruption” by U.S. President Donald Trump after he launched his own $TRUMP memecoin in January 2025. “What we’re witnessing isn’t just unethical; it’s the largest fraud and abuse of power in modern history,” Waters wrote. “If these bills become law, America will eventually face its first crypto-financial crisis,” she added. “And when that happens, my Republican colleagues will likely point fingers at everyone but themselves, just as they’ve always done, and say they had no idea this could happen.” Political Polarization Over Crypto Heats Up News of Waters’ op-ed comes as Republicans acknowledge the first-ever “Crypto Week” on Capitol Hill as digital asset legislation moves through Congress. In response, Waters and fellow Congressman Stephen Lynch (D-MA) announced that the week of July 14 would also be known as “Anti-Crypto Corruption Week” in opposition to their political opponents’ mobilization to pass crypto legislation. “These bills would make Congress complicit in Trump’s unprecedented crypto scam—one that has personally enriched himself, his entire family, and the billionaire insiders in his cabinet, all while defrauding investors,” Waters said in a July 11 statement. However, it is still unclear just which pieces of crypto legislation will make it to the Oval Office for ratification.

Fed Richmond President Thomas Barkin offered an indirect response to interest rate policy. Barkin stated that they do not expect a return to the high inflationary pressures seen in 2022, but noted that customs duties could create new price pressures. He added that the final tariff levels have not yet been finalized.

He also said the US will provide full access to the Indonesian market. He noted that Indonesia possesses valuable resources such as rare earth elements.

He calls it a strategic recalibration to preserve America’s global tech edge. According to an interview on Tuesday, Sacks said the move—specifically permitting Nvidia to ship its H20 chips—would help the US compete more effectively on the world stage while curbing Chinese tech giant Huawei’s efforts to dominate global markets. Strategic pivot aims to undercut Huawei and bolster US tech supremacy The US is not allowing the sale of its most advanced AI chips to China. Still, the policy aims to prevent Huawei from dominating the Chinese market and using that advantage to scale up and challenge American firms globally. According to AI chief David Sacks, the strategy is deliberately nuanced and designed to serve broader economic and national interests. The reversal is a significant win for Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who has spent months lobbying for relief from strict export rules. Huang met with President Trump last week to make his case directly. “Jensen has been making the case publicly for competing in China, and there are a lot of merits to the argument,” Sacks added. The meeting occurred last Thursday, as Nvidia became the first company to end a trading day with a market cap above $4 trillion . The firm edged past Apple and Microsoft to reach the symbolic milestone. The stock briefly hit that level during intraday trading on Wednesday of the same week. Trump applauded Nvidia’s stock performance in a social media post Thursday morning. “NVIDIA IS UP 47% SINCE TRUMP TARIFFS. USA is taking in Hundreds of Billions of Dollars in Tariffs,” Trump posted on Truth Social . “COUNTRY IS NOW ‘BACK.’” Nvidia, AMD score billions as Washington reverses AI chip ban Late Monday, Nvidia announced it had received assurances from the US government to resume exports of certain chips to China. Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Nvidia’s main competitor, swiftly followed with a similar statement. The approvals mark a sharp policy reversal and could bring in billions of dollars in revenue for both companies this year, just months after the Trump administration insisted the matter was non-negotiable. Nvidia expects the reinstated H20 sales to recoup billions in lost revenue this year. The chip was initially designed to meet Biden-era export control standards. Still, the Trump administration tightened restrictions in April, requiring special licenses to sell the H20 and AMD’s MI308 chip to China. The tougher rules forced Nvidia to take a $4.5 billion writedown on unsold H20 inventory in Q1, with an additional $8 billion in potential lost sales. AMD also projected an $800 million charge for Q2 2025. Addressing national security concerns, Sacks dismissed the notion that resuming sales would empower China, calling the H20 “a deprecated chip.” He warned that overly rigid restrictions could backfire, pushing US allies and neutral countries toward Chinese alternatives. “If you don’t let these countries buy American tech, you’re pushing them into China’s arms,” he said. AI exports become a bargaining chip in US-China trade talks Although Trump officials had previously ruled out compromise on AI chip exports, Sacks said the policy shift aligns with a broader strategy to build an “American AI stack” fully based on US-made chips, operating systems, and AI models. Sacks noted that it’s a zero-sum game. He continued to say that they want it all to be American-made and American-powered. Sacks insisted that if they hobbled their firms, they would give China an advantage. The decision comes after months of diplomatic back-and-forth between Washington and Beijing. In a broader trade agreement unveiled last month, the US agreed to ease restrictions on chip-design software exports in exchange for increased Chinese cooperation on rare-earth mineral sales, vital for high-tech manufacturing. Earlier Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that the H20 chip restrictions had become a bargaining chip in ongoing talks, despite previous denials of such trade-offs. Bessent described the decision as a strategic bargaining tool used during negotiations in Geneva and London, suggesting it was part of a broader exchange in which both sides had leverage and mutual interests to pursue.

This legislative push could reshape the regulatory landscape for digital assets in America, impacting everything from how tokens are classified to the very future of central bank digital currencies. Are we on the cusp of clarity or complexity? What’s Happening with US House Crypto Legislation? According to Eleanor Terrett, host of Crypto in America, U.S. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise has scheduled a critical July 15 vote. This procedural vote aims to advance three major pieces of cryptocurrency legislation to the House floor, with final votes potentially taking place as early as July 16 or 17. This swift progression signals a serious intent from lawmakers to address the burgeoning digital asset space. The bills in question are: The CLARITY Act : Focused on establishing a clear market structure for digital assets. The GENIUS Act : Aimed at creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act : Proposing a ban on a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC). These legislative efforts represent a significant moment for the industry, as they could provide much-needed regulatory certainty or, conversely, impose restrictive measures. The outcome will undoubtedly influence the trajectory of innovation and investment within the United States’ crypto ecosystem. Decoding the CLARITY Act: Defining the Digital Asset Market One of the most anticipated pieces of legislation is the CLARITY Act. Its primary goal is to provide a definitive framework for the classification and regulation of digital assets. For years, the crypto industry has grappled with a lack of clear guidelines, leading to uncertainty over whether a digital asset should be considered a security, a commodity, or something else entirely. This ambiguity has stifled innovation and made it challenging for businesses to operate within legal boundaries. The CLARITY Act seeks to: Establish clear definitions for various types of digital assets. Determine which regulatory bodies (e.g., SEC, CFTC) have jurisdiction over specific assets. Create a pathway for projects to comply with regulations without stifling technological advancement. If passed, this act could bring a new era of predictability to the digital asset market , potentially attracting more institutional investment and fostering greater mainstream adoption. It’s about creating a level playing field where innovation can thrive within a regulated environment. The GENIUS Act: What Does it Mean for Stablecoin Regulation? Stablecoins have emerged as a critical component of the crypto economy, acting as a bridge between traditional finance and decentralized digital assets. However, their rapid growth has also raised concerns about stability, transparency, and consumer protection. The GENIUS Act directly addresses these issues by proposing a comprehensive framework for stablecoin regulation . Key aspects of the GENIUS Act are expected to include: Reserve Requirements : Mandating that stablecoin issuers hold adequate reserves to back their tokens, ensuring 1:1 parity with the underlying fiat currency. Auditing and Transparency : Requiring regular audits and public disclosures of reserve holdings to build trust and prevent collapses like that of TerraUSD. Licensing and Supervision : Establishing a licensing regime for stablecoin issuers, potentially under the oversight of federal banking regulators. The push for robust stablecoin regulation is a response to global financial stability concerns and the need to protect consumers. A well-regulated stablecoin market could enhance confidence in the broader crypto ecosystem, making it a more reliable and integrated part of the global financial system. The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act: Preventing a US CBDC Ban? Perhaps the most contentious of the three bills is the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which aims to prohibit the creation of a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC). The concept of a CBDC has been a topic of intense debate, with proponents citing potential benefits like faster payments and financial inclusion, while critics raise serious concerns about privacy, government overreach, and potential for surveillance. Those advocating for a CBDC ban argue that a government-issued digital currency could: Erode Financial Privacy : Allowing the government to track every transaction, potentially leading to a loss of financial anonymity. Enable Surveillance : Providing a tool for direct government control over citizens’ spending habits and access to funds. Centralize Power : Shifting significant economic power from commercial banks and individuals to the central bank. The passage of this act would signal a strong legislative stance against a U.S. CBDC, prioritizing individual privacy and decentralized finance over potential governmental control. This is a critical point for many in the crypto community who value the permissionless and private nature of existing cryptocurrencies. Why These Crypto Bills Matter to You Whether you’re an investor, a developer, or simply curious about the future of finance, these impending votes carry immense weight. The decisions made in the coming days will have ripple effects across the entire crypto landscape: For Investors : Regulatory clarity can reduce market volatility and attract more capital, potentially leading to growth. Conversely, overly restrictive laws could deter investment. For Businesses and Innovators : Clear rules of the road are essential for building sustainable businesses. Uncertainty breeds hesitation, while a defined framework can foster innovation. For the Global Standing of the US : How the U.S. regulates crypto will influence its competitiveness in the global digital economy. Other nations are watching closely. For Privacy Advocates : The CBDC debate directly impacts the future of financial privacy and the balance of power between citizens and the state. The stakes are incredibly high, and the outcomes of these votes could define the next chapter for digital assets in the United States. What Happens Next? Actionable Insights As the July 15 procedural vote approaches, followed by potential final votes on July 16 or 17, here’s what to watch for: Bipartisan Support : Will these bills garner enough support from both sides of the aisle to pass? Bipartisan backing is crucial for enduring legislation. Industry Reaction : How will the cryptocurrency industry, advocacy groups, and major players react to the results? Their response could influence future legislative efforts. Market Impact : While direct price movements are hard to predict, significant regulatory news often causes market shifts. Stay informed and be prepared for potential volatility. Global Implications : How will other countries react to the U.S. stance on crypto regulation, particularly concerning stablecoins and CBDCs? Staying informed through reliable sources like Eleanor Terrett’s updates will be key. This moment could mark a significant turning point, bringing either much-needed certainty or new challenges to the rapidly evolving world of digital finance. A Pivotal Moment for Digital Assets The impending votes in the U.S. House of Representatives on the CLARITY Act, the GENIUS Act for stablecoin regulation, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act represent a truly pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. These legislative efforts aim to bring structure and clarity to a space that has long operated under a cloud of regulatory ambiguity. Whether they succeed in fostering innovation while ensuring consumer protection and financial stability remains to be seen. The outcomes will not only shape the future of the digital asset market in the United States but will also send a powerful signal to the global financial community. The world is watching as the U.S. grapples with defining its role in the digital financial revolution.

Today, the U.S. stock markets opened with a distinctly mixed tune, a scenario that often leaves investors pondering the underlying rhythm. For those keenly watching the cryptocurrency space, understanding these traditional market movements isn’t just academic; it’s crucial for grasping the broader economic currents that frequently ripple into digital asset valuations. Let’s delve into what this mixed opening signifies and how it might influence the dynamic world of crypto. What Does the U.S. Stock Market Performance Reveal? As the trading day commenced, the initial readings from the major U.S. indices presented a nuanced picture: S&P 500: +0.43% NASDAQ Composite: +0.79% Dow Jones Industrial Average: 0% This snapshot immediately tells us that while there’s positive momentum in certain sectors, the market isn’t uniformly surging. The S&P 500, often seen as a bellwether for the broader U.S. economy, showing a modest gain suggests underlying resilience. However, the flat performance of the Dow Jones indicates a lack of decisive direction among its 30 blue-chip constituents. This mixed bag often reflects an environment where investors are selectively positioning themselves, rather than engaging in a broad-based rally or sell-off. Understanding this varied U.S. stock market performance is key to deciphering the prevailing economic mood. Is Strong NASDAQ Performance Driving Optimism? The standout performer this morning is undoubtedly the NASDAQ Composite, registering a solid +0.79% gain. This index is heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks, making its performance a strong indicator of investor appetite for innovation and future earnings potential. A robust NASDAQ performance often signals a renewed confidence in the tech sector, which has historically been a significant driver of market growth. What might be fueling this optimism? Tech Resilience: Despite previous volatility, many tech giants continue to demonstrate strong earnings and innovation. Interest Rate Expectations: Hopes for a pause or even cuts in interest rates can boost growth stocks, as their future earnings become more valuable. AI Boom: The ongoing excitement around artificial intelligence continues to draw significant investment into companies at the forefront of this technology. For crypto enthusiasts, a strong tech sector can sometimes translate into a positive sentiment for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, given the technological overlap and growth-oriented nature of both markets. Decoding S&P 500 Trends: A Broader Market Health Check While the NASDAQ captures headlines with its tech-driven surges, the S&P 500 offers a more holistic view of the U.S. equity market. Its +0.43% gain, though modest, is significant. The S&P 500 trends reflect the health of 500 of the largest U.S. publicly traded companies, spanning various sectors from financials to healthcare and consumer goods. This broad representation makes it an excellent barometer for overall economic sentiment. A positive movement in the S&P 500 suggests that a wider range of industries are experiencing positive momentum or at least holding steady. This can be a sign of underlying economic stability, even if the Dow Jones remains flat. Investors often look to the S&P 500 for clues about corporate earnings, consumer spending, and the general direction of the economy. When this index shows gains, it often reinforces a sense of cautious optimism across the market. How Does Investor Sentiment Influence Market Direction? The mixed open is a direct reflection of current investor sentiment – a blend of hope, caution, and strategic positioning. When some indices rise while others remain flat, it suggests a nuanced view among market participants. Factors shaping this sentiment include: Inflation Data: Upcoming or recent inflation reports can heavily sway investor mood. Lower inflation often boosts confidence, while higher inflation can lead to uncertainty. Federal Reserve Policy: The Fed’s stance on interest rates and monetary policy remains a dominant force. Any hints of future rate hikes or cuts can cause significant shifts. Geopolitical Developments: Global events, from conflicts to trade agreements, can introduce volatility and influence risk appetite. Corporate Earnings: Strong earnings reports from bellwether companies can instill confidence, while misses can dampen spirits. Understanding this intricate dance of sentiment is crucial, as it dictates capital flows not just in traditional stocks but also in alternative assets like cryptocurrencies. Exploring the Crypto Market Correlation with Traditional Finance For the cryptocurrency community, the immediate question is always: “What does this mean for Bitcoin and altcoins?” Historically, the crypto market correlation with traditional finance, particularly the tech-heavy NASDAQ, has been observed. When tech stocks perform well, there’s often a spillover effect into riskier assets like crypto, as investors feel more confident deploying capital into high-growth, speculative ventures. Conversely, a downturn in traditional markets can lead to a “risk-off” environment, where investors pull back from crypto. However, it’s important to note that while correlations exist, they are not always perfectly linear or constant. The crypto market has its own unique drivers, including: Regulatory News: Developments in crypto regulation can have a profound impact, independent of stock market movements. Technological Advancements: Breakthroughs in blockchain technology or specific protocols can drive crypto adoption and value. Macroeconomic Factors: Global liquidity, inflation hedges, and the search for alternative investments continue to play a significant role. Market-Specific Events: Halvings, network upgrades, or major exchange news can create internal market dynamics. Today’s mixed stock market open suggests a selective risk-on appetite, which could provide a modest tailwind for digital assets, especially those perceived as growth-oriented. However, the flat Dow reminds us that caution still prevails in some corners of the market. Navigating the Nuances: Challenges and Opportunities The current market landscape presents both challenges and opportunities for investors across the board. The primary challenge lies in the lack of clear, uniform direction. This mixed signal requires investors to be more discerning and less reliant on broad market trends. For instance, while tech might be surging, other sectors might be struggling with inflationary pressures or supply chain issues. Opportunities, however, arise from this very selectivity. Investors can identify sectors or assets that are showing strength and capitalize on them. For crypto investors, this means keeping an eye on projects that align with the current narrative of growth and innovation, much like the tech stocks leading the NASDAQ. Diversification remains a key strategy, spreading risk across different asset classes and within the crypto space itself. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor In a market characterized by mixed signals, what steps can investors take? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on economic data, corporate earnings, and central bank communications. These are the primary drivers of market sentiment. Analyze Sector Performance: Don’t just look at the overall indices. Understand which sectors are leading and which are lagging to identify potential opportunities or risks. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: A mixed market can be volatile. Ensure your portfolio aligns with your comfort level for risk. Consider Diversification: Spreading investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, crypto, real estate) can help mitigate risk during uncertain times. Long-Term Perspective: Short-term fluctuations are common. A long-term investment horizon can help weather market choppiness. For crypto investors, this means continuing to research fundamental strengths of projects, understanding their utility, and not solely relying on traditional market movements for investment decisions. A Resilient Outlook Amidst Market Crossroads Today’s mixed opening in the U.S. stock markets serves as a potent reminder of the complex forces at play in global finance. While the NASDAQ’s impressive gains signal robust investor confidence in technology and growth, the S&P 500’s modest rise points to broader market resilience, even as the Dow remains flat, indicating a degree of caution. This nuanced landscape underscores the importance of a discerning approach for investors, both in traditional equities and the interconnected world of cryptocurrencies. As the market continues to unfold, staying informed and adaptable will be paramount to navigating these intricate crossroads successfully. The interplay between traditional financial indicators and the evolving crypto ecosystem will undoubtedly continue to shape investment strategies in the months ahead.

According to the Financial Times , people with direct knowledge of the discussions have shared that the acquisition is planned via Cantor Equity Partners 1. It is a special‑purpose acquisition company that secured $200 million in its January IPO. Insiders have said that the negotiations are now approaching their closing stages. The discussions involve terms under which Adam Back, founder of the crypto trading firm Blockstream Capital, would help Cantor Equity Partners 1 buy over $3 billion of bitcoin. This move follows an April initiative Brandon Lutnick led alongside SoftBank and Tether, in which about $3.6 billion was invested in bitcoin. It aligns with Cantor Fitzgerald’s broader strategy of leveraging publicly listed shell vehicles to accumulate bitcoin, capitalizing on a rally in cryptocurrency valuations amid President Trump’s deregulatory push. In May, Howard Lutnick handed control of the firm over to his children. Draft deal includes 30,000 bitcoins and $800 million capital raise Under the draft agreement, Back would transfer as many as 30,000 bitcoins, valued at more than $3 billion, to Cantor Equity Partners 1. The SPAC also plans to raise up to $800 million from outside investors to fund additional purchases, potentially driving the total transaction value past $4 billion. In return for their bitcoin contribution, Back and Blockstream Capital would receive equity in the SPAC, which is slated to be renamed BSTR Holdings. Insiders indicate that as discussions wrap up, the deal could be completed within days, although terms remain under negotiation. Its timing coincides with what some lawmakers have dubbed “crypto week” as Congress considers digital‑currency legislation. Should the transaction close as anticipated, Cantor would rank among the globe’s leading purchasers of cryptocurrency. Lutnick leads Cantor’s crypto push as Back brings bitcoin legacy The effort is spearheaded by Brandon Lutnick, who took the chairmanship in February after his father’s confirmation as the administration’s chief trade representative. Combined with acquisitions through a second listed vehicle, Twenty One Capital, Cantor’s total bitcoin purchases could approach $10 billion by year‑end. Adam Back is widely recognized as one of the earliest champions of cryptocurrency technology. His 1997 introduction of the Hashcash proof‑of‑work mechanism was cited by Satoshi Nakamoto in the original Bitcoin white paper. He went on to co‑found Blockstream in 2014, a blockchain‑technology company backed by investors such as Khosla Ventures and Baillie Gifford. In the current year, Back has funded multiple enterprises building significant bitcoin treasuries. According to investors, he put €5 million into The Blockchain Group, a Paris‑listed company, during an equity raise announced this week. In June, he financed a SEK 150 million convertible bond for H100 Group, a Swedish health‑tech firm that has also added bitcoin to its balance sheet. This transaction reflects a broader movement in which SPAC structures are deployed to acquire bitcoin, as investors look to mirror Michael Saylor’s approach at MicroStrategy Ltd. Other recent players include Trump Media & Technology Group, founded by President Donald Trump, and a blank‑check enterprise led by crypto advocate Anthony Pompliano.

BCH is now down by 2.5% in the past week and by 7.5% in the past fortnight, although the altcoin holds on to a 10% increase in a month and a 25% gain in the past year. In fact, Bitcoin Cash is up by an impressive 81% since falling to a 2025 low of $268 on April 9, while BTC is up by ‘only’ 53% since hitting its 2025 low, also on the same date. This suggests that BCH has greater medium-term momentum than BTC at the moment, and while it would be a huge stretch to claim that the altcoin will flip Bitcoin this cycle, this momentum points to a very positive Bitcoin Cash price prediction . Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction: BCH Outperforms Bitcoin in 2025 – Could It Flip BTC This Cycle? If we look at Bitcoin Cash’s chart today, we see that be close to correcting, given that its indicators are dropping from overbought positions. For instance, its MACD (orange, blue) appears to have peaked earlier this month, and is now sliding downwards. Source: TradingView Likewise, BCH’s relative strength index (yellow) has dropped from 70 a few days ago to just below 50 today, a sign of a significant dump. Its 24-hour trading volume has also begun to fall away, from just over $520 million a couple of days ago to $320 million today. Worryingly, this is not significantly higher than where it was a year ago, suggesting that Bitcoin Cash hasn’t benefitted that much from the recent market-wide bull movement. There are various reasons for this, but perhaps the biggest reason is the lack of institutional interest in BCH. For example, Bitcoin Cash doesn’t even appear on CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows report , whereas the likes of BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL and LTC account for anything from $179.5 billion (BTC) to $215 million (LTC) in total assets under management. In turn, this stems from the lack of spot-based BCH ETFs in the US, with the SEC so far delaying to approve any multi-crypto fund (e.g. Bitwise’s 10 Crypto Index Fund ) that also includes Bitcoin Cash. Bitwise announces their 19b-4 to list their 10 Crypto Index fund, which includes XRP. The 19b-4 is the stock exchange listing form. https://t.co/RjT3ZHhTDG pic.twitter.com/v2dPyM6HLf — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) November 15, 2024 But once such funds do receive the green light, we could see demand for Bitcoin Cash accelerate, which in turn could boost the Bitcoin Cash price. It has the potential to reach $500 in the next few weeks, while it’s also on course to hit $600 early in the fall. Bitcoin Hyper Raises $2.8 Million for BTC Layer-Two Network: Is This the Next Big Altcoin? Bitcoin Cash isn’t the only BTC-adjacent altcoin that could do very well in the coming months, with several other similar alts also showing lots of potential right now. Chief amongst these is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), a new Solana-based layer two network for Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin Hyper has already raised just over $2.9 million in its ongoing presale, with investors excited by its plans for the future. As an L2, it will help Bitcoin users to achieve greater throughput, while also charging a fraction of the usual transaction fees. The platform works by providing a bridge between itself Bitcoin (its Canonical Bridge), which allows users to deposit BTC and receive a corresponding share of Solana-based BTC. Users will then be able to use this bridged BTC with Bitcoin Hyper’s growing ecosystem of DeFi apps, enabling them to put their BTC to work. Bitcoin Hyper batches and compresses its transactions, using zero-knowledge proofs for validation, before committing the state of its network to Bitcoin’s blockchain. Given that HYPER is the native token of the L2, it could experience lots of demand in the coming months. Investors can buy it now by going to the Bitcoin Hyper website and connecting a compatible wallet. HYPER currently costs $0.012275, although this will rise again tomorrow.

The closure of the probes launched in the final months of the Biden administration indicates a broader regulatory shift under President Trump, whose administration has adopted a more crypto-friendly stance. Polymarket Cleared as DOJ and CFTC Close Probes Without Action According to a Bloomberg report published Tuesday, Polymarket was formally notified earlier this month that both the DOJ and CFTC had concluded their inquiries without pursuing further action. The investigations sought to determine whether the New York-based platform continued to allow U.S. residents to place bets despite a 2022 settlement with regulators that banned such access. Neither the DOJ nor the CFTC issued public comments on the case, and Polymarket itself has remained measured in its response. Still, CEO Shayne Coplan shared his reflections in a personal post on X, offering rare insight into the toll the scrutiny had taken. “Eight months ago, on election night, we were on top of the world… Eight days later, the FBI broke down my door at 6am and took all my computers and phones,” he wrote. 8 months ago, on election night, we were on top of the world after Polymarket called the election. 8 days later, the FBI broke down my door at 6am and took all my computers and phones, looking for anything that could imply foul play. While traumatic, it etched the story of… pic.twitter.com/EOfJQTCzMY — Shayne Coplan (@shayne_coplan) July 15, 2025 Coplan described the experience as traumatic but said it showed Polymarket’s accuracy and resilience. He confirmed the company has been cleared of wrongdoing, stating, “Justice prevailed. God Bless America.” Polymarket allows users to bet with cryptocurrency on real-world outcomes, from election results and geopolitical conflicts to economic indicators and proposed legislation. The platform rose to prominence during the 2024 U.S. election cycle, when users speculated heavily on Donald Trump’s chances of returning to office. That wave of attention, however, brought scrutiny. In 2022, the CFTC fined Polymarket $1.4 million , accusing it of running an unregistered derivatives platform and ordering it to block U.S. users from placing bets. While Polymarket complied officially, regulators suspected the platform may still have been accessed by American traders using VPNs or other tools to circumvent the ban. FBI agents have reportedly seized Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan’s phone and electronics, following a raid at his Manhattan residence. #FBIraid #Polymarket #ShayneCoplan https://t.co/FoAECymNsu — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 14, 2024 The situation escalated dramatically in November 2024, just days after the election, when the FBI raided Coplan’s Manhattan residence and seized electronic devices in a surprise early morning operation. The investigation, which also involved the CFTC , focused on whether Polymarket had violated its earlier agreement by allowing disguised U.S. trading activity to continue. As part of the settlement, the company committed to geo-blocking U.S. residents. In response to the closure of the investigation, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong publicly decried the DOJ’s actions, saying, “This was one of the most egregious examples of lawfare from the last administration that should never have been possible in America. Imagine having your door broken down for predicting an election.” Armstrong continued, adding that “The onus was on the government to prove there was something worth pursuing here, and they failed to do that. This is how you lose trust in institutions.” This was one of the most egregious examples of lawfare from the last administration, that should never have been possible in America.

At its peak in November 2024, Polymarket recorded a staggering $2.6 billion in monthly trading volume. While volume dipped to $1.1 billion in May 2025, activity remains strong. Polymarket now hosts over 21,000 markets with 1.2 million users and $700 million in active trading. With the DOJ and CFTC inquiries officially closed, industry watchers believe Polymarket may explore reentering the U.S. market in a more regulated form by either registering as a designated contract market (DCM) under the CFTC or acquiring a firm with an existing license. While the platform will reportedly be working its way back into the U.S., it did not stop developing even during the CFTC and FBI investigations. Polymarket is in the midst of a major expansion effort, reportedly closing in on a $200 million funding round led by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund. @Polymarket , a crypto-based prediction market platform, is on the verge of closing a $200 million funding round that would value the company at $1 billion. #Polymarket #Crypto https://t.co/wkfbhY7fVe — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 25, 2025 Additionally, the platform recently announced a partnership with Elon Musk’s X and its AI division, xAI, to integrate prediction markets into the social media platform.

Polymarket’s main rival, Kalshi, recently won a legal victory against the CFTC when the watchdog moved to voluntarily dismiss its appeal of a ruling in Kalshi’s favor, effectively conceding that election betting contracts may have a place in the American financial sector. With Polymarket now legally in the clear, the question is whether the U.S. will allow the platform to operate under a regulated framework.

The failed vote stalled the highly anticipated legislative push dubbed part of “Crypto Week,” dealing a setback to the digital asset industry. The vote , which failed 196–222, prevented the House from beginning formal consideration of the GENIUS Act, a landmark bill aimed at establishing the first federal framework for U.S. stablecoins. The collapse of the motion also blocked debate on the annual defense spending bill and a related crypto clarity proposal. With over a dozen Republican holdouts joining Democrats to oppose the rule, House GOP leadership was left scrambling to salvage what was billed as the most ambitious crypto policy package in U.S. history. Discord within Republican ranks While the crypto industry had hoped for a seamless passage of legislation that had already cleared the Senate, internal fractures among Republicans derailed the plan. Notably, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of the GOP defectors, publicly criticized the GENIUS Act for lacking a provision to ban central bank digital currencies ( CBDCs ). “I just voted NO on the Rule for the GENIUS Act because it does not include a ban on Central Bank Digital Currency,” Greene wrote on X . “Americans do not want a government-controlled Central Bank Digital Currency. Republicans have a duty to ban CBDC.” I just voted NO on the Rule for the GENIUS Act because it does not include a ban on Central Bank Digital Currency and because Speaker Johnson did not allow us to submit amendments to the GENIUS Act. Americans do not want a government-controlled Central Bank Digital Currency.… pic.twitter.com/NnkeIOH0dE — Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene🇺🇸 (@RepMTG) July 15, 2025 Greene also faulted Speaker Mike Johnson for not allowing amendments to be introduced. Speaker Mike Johnson and House leadership had attempted to bundle the crypto bills with the defense appropriations bill to streamline the legislative push and avoid political infighting. Instead, the strategy backfired. While the GENIUS Act had previously cleared the Senate with bipartisan support in a 68–30 vote, House conservatives accused Johnson of denying them the chance to amend the legislation, including provisions to bar the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC. Some, including Rep. Greene, insisted the bill should reflect President Trump’s January executive order banning CBDCs across federal agencies. Other lawmakers, meanwhile, objected to the bundling itself, wanting each bill, especially the highly sensitive defense budget, to be considered on its own. Vote triggers market reactions News of the failed vote quickly rippled across financial markets. Shares of Circle , the issuer of the USDC stablecoin and one of the bill’s main beneficiaries, fell by nearly 5%. Coinbase and MARA Holdings each dropped by about 2%. CRCL stock price. Source: Google Finance Industry advocates, who had spent over $245 million during the 2024 election cycle to back pro-crypto candidates and policies, had framed this week as a major turning point for crypto’s future in Washington. Fairshake, the crypto sector’s leading political action committee, recently disclosed $141 million in cash reserves to continue lobbying efforts and support crypto-friendly candidates ahead of the 2026 midterms. The GENIUS Act’s passage was seen as a regulatory milestone and a potential economic boon. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent previously stated that the U.S. stablecoin market could grow to over $2 trillion if the legislation is enacted. David Sacks, the White House’s AI and crypto czar, also said the bill could unlock “trillions of dollars in new demand” for U.S. Treasuries. The House leadership is reportedly planning a second vote on the rule as early as Tuesday evening, although it’s tentative, and so far, no changes to the bill text or bundling approach have yet been confirmed. Still, there is no clear path forward. To satisfy hardliners like Greene, Johnson may be forced to reopen the legislative process and allow amendments, including a formal CBDC ban, that could jeopardize bipartisan Senate support.

For those deeply invested in the future of decentralized finance, a significant development from the Core Foundation is poised to reshape how value is distributed within blockchain ecosystems. The organization behind Core, the robust Bitcoin-based, EVM-compatible Layer 1 network, has just launched an groundbreaking initiative: the Rev+ revenue-sharing program. This move isn’t just a technical upgrade; it’s a strategic pivot towards a more equitable and sustainable economic model for all participants. What is the Rev+ Model and Why Does It Matter? At its core, the Rev+ model is a pioneering mechanism designed to distribute a portion of the network’s gas fee revenue back to key contributors within the Core ecosystem. Traditionally, gas fees primarily compensate miners or validators for processing transactions. While essential, this model often leaves other crucial ecosystem participants, such as stablecoin issuers, application developers, and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), without direct financial incentives from network activity. The Core Foundation’s Rev+ program directly addresses this gap. By allocating gas fee revenue to these vital entities, Rev+ aims to: Incentivize Growth: Directly reward those who bring users and activity to the network. Foster Sustainability: Provide a recurring revenue stream for projects, reducing reliance on grants or venture capital. Promote Innovation: Encourage the development of high-quality applications and stablecoins on the Core blockchain. Enhance Decentralization: Empower DAOs with resources to govern and develop the ecosystem further. This approach marks a significant shift, moving beyond simple token emissions to create a self-sustaining economic loop that benefits everyone contributing to the network’s vitality. How Does Crypto Revenue Sharing Work with Rev+? The mechanics of the crypto revenue sharing within the Rev+ program are designed to be transparent and merit-based. According to reports, the model distributes gas fee revenue based on user activity and contribution metrics. This means that the more a stablecoin is used, the more an application is interacted with, or the more a DAO contributes to governance and development, the greater their share of the distributed revenue. Let’s break down the primary beneficiaries and their roles: Beneficiary Type Role in Ecosystem How Rev+ Benefits Them Stablecoin Issuers Provide liquidity and stability to the ecosystem, facilitating transactions and DeFi activities. Receive a share of gas fees generated by transactions involving their stablecoins, incentivizing adoption and usage. Developers Build decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and tools that drive user engagement and utility. Earn revenue based on the activity their dApps generate, creating a sustainable business model for building on Core. DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) Govern and manage various aspects of the ecosystem, including treasury management, protocol upgrades, and community initiatives. Receive funds to support their operations, development, and community-driven proposals, strengthening decentralized governance. This targeted distribution ensures that those who are actively fostering adoption and utility are directly rewarded, creating a powerful feedback loop for growth. It’s a smart way to align incentives across the entire ecosystem, moving beyond speculative value to intrinsic utility. The Significance of a Bitcoin EVM for Rev+ The Core network’s foundation as a Bitcoin EVM is crucial to understanding the full potential of the Rev+ model. By combining the security and decentralization of Bitcoin with the programmability and developer-friendliness of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Core offers a unique and powerful platform. This hybrid architecture means that developers familiar with Ethereum’s robust tooling and smart contract capabilities can easily build on Core, while users benefit from Bitcoin’s unparalleled trust and established network effect. For Rev+, the Bitcoin EVM integration means: Enhanced Security: Leveraging Bitcoin’s proof-of-work security model for the underlying Layer 1 provides a robust foundation for financial applications. Broad Developer Adoption: The EVM compatibility attracts a vast pool of existing Ethereum developers, accelerating dApp deployment and user growth. Interoperability Potential: Bridges between Bitcoin and EVM environments open up new possibilities for cross-chain functionality and liquidity. This unique blend positions Core not just as another Layer 1, but as a bridge between the two largest blockchain ecosystems, creating a fertile ground for the Rev+ model to thrive and distribute significant value. Exploring Core as a Leading Layer 1 Blockchain The Core network is rapidly establishing itself as a significant Layer 1 blockchain in the competitive crypto space. Its design principles emphasize decentralization, scalability, and security, aiming to provide a robust infrastructure for a wide range of decentralized applications, from DeFi protocols to NFTs and GameFi. Key features that make Core a compelling Layer 1 include: Satoshi Plus Consensus: A unique hybrid consensus mechanism that combines delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) with Bitcoin’s hash power, ensuring both decentralization and security. EVM Compatibility: Full compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, allowing for seamless migration and development of dApps. Native Bitcoin Integration: Deep integration with Bitcoin, enabling the use of BTC as gas and for other utilities within the Core ecosystem. The introduction of Rev+ further strengthens Core’s position as a leading Layer 1. By directly rewarding active participation, it creates a virtuous cycle: more developers and stablecoin issuers are attracted, leading to more user activity, which in turn generates more revenue for distribution, fueling further growth. This economic model is designed to attract and retain the best projects and talent, fostering a vibrant and self-sustaining ecosystem. What are the Actionable Insights for Participants? For anyone involved in the crypto space – whether you’re a developer, a stablecoin issuer, a DAO member, or simply a user – the launch of Rev+ presents several actionable insights: For Developers: If you’re building dApps, consider deploying on Core. The Rev+ program offers a direct path to sustainable revenue based on your dApp’s usage, a significant advantage over traditional funding models. Focus on building applications that drive high user activity. For Stablecoin Issuers: Explore issuing your stablecoin on the Core network. The Rev+ model provides a direct incentive for your stablecoin’s adoption and transaction volume, offering a unique competitive edge. For DAOs: Engage actively within the Core ecosystem. Your contributions to governance, community building, and protocol development can now be directly rewarded through Rev+, providing resources for your initiatives. For Users: By transacting and interacting with dApps and stablecoins on the Core network, you are directly contributing to the economic sustainability of the ecosystem. Your activity helps reward the projects you use and value. This is a clear call to action for innovators and builders: Core Foundation is not just offering a platform, but a partnership in prosperity. The Future is Bright: A Compelling Summary of Rev+ The Core Foundation’s launch of the Rev+ revenue-sharing model marks a pivotal moment for the Core ecosystem and the broader blockchain industry. By strategically distributing gas fee revenue to stablecoin issuers, developers, and DAOs based on their contributions and user activity, Rev+ creates a powerful incentive structure for growth and sustainability. This innovative approach, built on the secure and versatile Bitcoin-based EVM-compatible Layer 1 network, positions Core as a trailblazer in fostering a truly equitable and self-sustaining decentralized economy. It’s a testament to the Core Foundation’s commitment to long-term value creation and community empowerment, promising a vibrant future for all participants.

The big news? GameStop views its Bitcoin holdings not as a speculative gamble, but as a crucial inflation hedge. This revelation from CEO Ryan Cohen provides a deeper insight into the company’s evolving financial philosophy, moving beyond its meme stock status to a more calculated approach to treasury management. For anyone tracking corporate crypto adoption or the future of retail, GameStop’s latest move offers a compelling case study. Why is GameStop Embracing Bitcoin as an Inflation Hedge? The concept of an inflation hedge is simple yet powerful: it’s an asset designed to retain or increase its value during periods of rising inflation, protecting purchasing power. In today’s economic climate, with persistent inflationary pressures, companies are increasingly seeking ways to safeguard their balance sheets. For GameStop, the decision to hold Bitcoin is a deliberate and strategic move in this direction. Unlike traditional assets that might erode in value due to inflation, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and finite supply of 21 million coins are often cited as its core strengths as a hedge. Proponents argue that its scarcity makes it resistant to the debasement of fiat currencies. GameStop’s CEO Ryan Cohen articulated this clearly, emphasizing that their Bitcoin holdings are specifically for this purpose, rather than an attempt to chase market trends or replicate the strategies of other companies. This approach contrasts sharply with some earlier corporate crypto adoptions, which were sometimes perceived as more speculative or driven by a desire to gain exposure to a rapidly appreciating asset. GameStop’s stance signals a maturity in its understanding of digital assets, positioning Bitcoin as a fundamental component of its treasury strategy designed to protect its substantial cash reserves against economic volatility. Ryan Cohen’s Vision: A Unique GameStop Strategy At the heart of GameStop’s bold financial moves is CEO Ryan Cohen . Known for his transformative work with Chewy and his activist investor background, Cohen has brought a distinct, independent vision to GameStop. His statement that GameStop follows its own approach and does not seek to replicate others’ models is crucial. This isn’t about following the crowd; it’s about charting a unique course tailored to GameStop’s specific needs and strengths. Cohen’s philosophy appears to prioritize long-term stability and resilience over short-term gains. This is evident in GameStop’s strong balance sheet, which boasts over $9 billion in cash and securities. This significant liquidity provides the company with immense flexibility and a cushion against market fluctuations. By allocating a portion of these substantial reserves into Bitcoin as an inflation hedge, Cohen is demonstrating a proactive risk management strategy. It suggests a belief that traditional cash holdings alone may not be sufficient to preserve value in an unpredictable economic landscape. This distinctive GameStop strategy underscores a commitment to financial prudence while also embracing innovative solutions. It’s a testament to Cohen’s leadership, which has consistently challenged conventional wisdom and sought to redefine GameStop’s place in the modern economy, moving it beyond its legacy as a brick-and-mortar retailer. The Broader Implications of Corporate Crypto Holdings GameStop’s move isn’t isolated; it’s part of a growing trend of companies exploring or adopting crypto holdings as part of their treasury management. While MicroStrategy has famously gone all-in on Bitcoin, viewing it as a primary treasury asset, and Tesla briefly accepted Bitcoin for payments, GameStop’s nuanced approach as a pure inflation hedge offers another model for corporate adoption. Benefits of Corporate Crypto Holdings: Inflation Protection: As GameStop demonstrates, Bitcoin’s scarcity can offer a hedge against fiat currency devaluation. Diversification: Adding uncorrelated assets like Bitcoin can diversify a company’s treasury, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Innovation and Forward-Thinking: Holding crypto can signal a company’s willingness to embrace new technologies and financial paradigms, appealing to a tech-savvy investor base. Potential for Appreciation: While GameStop emphasizes hedging, the long-term growth potential of Bitcoin remains an attractive underlying factor for many corporate holders. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate wildly, posing significant short-term risks to balance sheets. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, which can create compliance challenges. Accounting Treatment: Current accounting rules often require Bitcoin to be treated as an intangible asset, leading to potential impairment charges if its value drops. Security Risks: Storing significant amounts of cryptocurrency requires robust cybersecurity measures to prevent theft. The increasing number of companies like GameStop, Tesla, and MicroStrategy holding Bitcoin signifies a paradigm shift. It indicates a growing acceptance of digital assets beyond speculative trading, integrating them into fundamental corporate finance strategies. This trend could pave the way for more mainstream adoption and greater stability in the crypto markets over time. What Does This Mean for GameStop’s Future and Investors? For GameStop, this strategic allocation of capital into Bitcoin as an inflation hedge could have several implications. Firstly, it reinforces the company’s commitment to protecting its financial health in an unpredictable economic environment. This prudent approach may reassure long-term investors who are looking for stability beyond the speculative fervor that once surrounded the stock. Secondly, it positions GameStop as an innovative player, willing to leverage new financial instruments to achieve its objectives. This could attract a new segment of investors who are interested in companies that are forward-thinking in their treasury management and embrace digital assets. While the immediate impact on GameStop’s stock price might be tied to broader market sentiment around crypto, the underlying strategic rationale is about long-term value preservation. For investors, understanding GameStop’s rationale is key. This isn’t a pivot to becoming a crypto company, but rather a sophisticated use of a digital asset within a traditional corporate finance framework. It highlights the evolving role of Bitcoin from a niche investment to a recognized tool for hedging against macroeconomic risks. Monitoring GameStop’s balance sheet and how these Bitcoin holdings perform against inflation will be crucial for assessing the success of this strategy. A Strategic Play in a Volatile World GameStop’s decision to hold Bitcoin as an inflation hedge, championed by CEO Ryan Cohen, marks a significant moment in the intersection of traditional corporate finance and digital assets. It underscores a pragmatic and independent GameStop strategy focused on long-term financial resilience. By leveraging its robust balance sheet and adopting a nuanced approach to its crypto holdings , GameStop is not just participating in the crypto space; it’s defining its own path. This move highlights Bitcoin’s growing recognition as a legitimate tool for treasury management, offering a protective shield against the erosive effects of inflation. As the economic landscape continues to evolve, GameStop’s strategic foresight in utilizing Bitcoin inflation hedge capabilities may well serve as a blueprint for other companies navigating an uncertain future.

The burning question is whether it can surpass Ethereum in this bullish phase. This article delves into the potential of Solana and highlights which digital coins are primed for growth, capturing the interest of investors looking for the next big opportunity. This analysis is brought to you by OutsetPR . As a crypto-native PR firm, Outset PR specializes in crafting communication strategies built on data, trend signals, and market relevance, empowering crypto leaders to transform fleeting opportunities into sustained visibility and growth. Solana Eyes $179 as Momentum Builds Amid Recent Gains Source: tradingview Solana's price is dancing between roughly $150 and $170, showing a healthy uptick over the past week and month. A key resistance lies just shy of $180, and if Solana pushes past this, the next target could be near $200. With recent upgrades of nearly 10% for the week and over 12% for the month, Solana's upward journey seems promising. Market watchers are keen to see if this momentum continues, with hopes that it can reach the next resistance for a possible rise of about 18% from current levels. However, it is sailing just above the $138 support, cautious of downside risks. Ethereum Price Action: Poised for Potential Growth Source: tradingview Ethereum's price currently floats between two thousand six hundred and three thousand one hundred. The crypto has seen a near 18% bump in the last week, hinting at bullish momentum. Its ten-day moving average of just over three thousand matches its 100-day average, showing stability. With its RSI above 60, Ethereum isn’t in overbought territory, suggesting room for growth. If Ethereum breaks its nearest resistance at three thousand three hundred, it could climb to its second resistance near three thousand nine hundred—a growth potential of around 23%. However, it needs to stay above its support at two thousand three hundred to maintain momentum. Overall, signs point to possible positive movement ahead.

The company recently announced a strategic acquisition of an additional 3.02 Bitcoin (BTC), significantly bolstering its Bitcoin holdings and signaling a continued commitment to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Who is Planet Ventures and Why Are They Investing in Crypto? Planet Ventures , a publicly traded company based in Canada, has been steadily making its mark in the digital asset space. While many traditional firms are still contemplating their entry into the volatile yet lucrative cryptocurrency market, Planet Ventures has chosen a proactive approach. Their strategy aligns with a growing number of forward-thinking corporations that view Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate treasury reserve asset. This move by Planet Ventures is indicative of a broader trend where companies are seeking alternative stores of value and growth opportunities outside of traditional financial instruments. By diversifying into digital assets, they aim to hedge against inflation, capitalize on potential appreciation, and signal a modern, innovative outlook to their investors. This foresight positions them among the early adopters in the corporate world. Decoding Planet Ventures’ Growing Bitcoin Holdings The recent announcement details the acquisition of an additional 3.02 BTC. This incremental purchase might seem modest on its own, but it pushes Planet Ventures’ total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 19.71 BTC. For a company to publicly disclose and consistently increase its Bitcoin reserves speaks volumes about its conviction in the long-term value proposition of the digital gold. What does 19.71 BTC represent? While the exact fiat value fluctuates daily with market prices, this cumulative figure positions Planet Ventures as a notable player among publicly listed companies with Bitcoin on their balance sheets. It signifies a calculated accumulation strategy, potentially aimed at building a robust digital treasury that can appreciate over time and provide a hedge against economic uncertainties and traditional financial system risks. The Rationale Behind This Latest BTC Acquisition Every BTC acquisition by a public company is typically driven by a well-thought-out strategy. For Planet Ventures, this latest purchase likely stems from a combination of factors. It could be a response to current market conditions, perhaps seeing a favorable entry point, or simply a continuation of a pre-defined dollar-cost averaging strategy designed to mitigate volatility over time. The decision to make another BTC acquisition underscores a belief in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition: its decentralized nature, scarcity, and potential as a global, censorship-resistant store of value. Companies like Planet Ventures are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin as a viable alternative to traditional cash reserves, which are subject to inflationary pressures and diminishing returns in low-interest-rate environments. This strategic move highlights a long-term vision for their corporate treasury. Broader Implications for Corporate Crypto Investment Planet Ventures’ consistent activity in the crypto space contributes to a broader narrative of increasing corporate crypto investment . This trend, spearheaded by companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla, validates Bitcoin and other digital assets as legitimate components of a corporate treasury strategy. It signals to the wider market that cryptocurrencies are maturing beyond speculative assets into fundamental financial instruments. The benefits for companies engaging in crypto investment are clear: potential for significant capital appreciation, diversification of treasury assets, and an appeal to a new generation of investors. However, challenges remain, including market volatility, evolving regulatory landscapes, and the need for robust security measures to protect these digital holdings. Despite these hurdles, the momentum for corporate adoption appears to be growing, indicating a shift in traditional finance. What’s Next for Planet Ventures’ Digital Assets Strategy? With their total Bitcoin holdings now at 19.71 BTC, what does the future hold for Planet Ventures’ digital assets strategy? It’s reasonable to expect that the company will continue to monitor market conditions closely and potentially make further acquisitions if they align with their long-term financial objectives. Their consistent approach suggests a strategic, rather than opportunistic, engagement with the crypto market, focusing on sustained growth. Beyond Bitcoin, it will be interesting to observe if Planet Ventures diversifies its digital assets portfolio to include other major cryptocurrencies or perhaps explore opportunities in decentralized finance (DeFi) or non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the future. Their current focus on Bitcoin, however, indicates a foundational belief in the leading cryptocurrency as a primary store of value and a cornerstone of their treasury management. Planet Ventures’ latest acquisition of 3.02 BTC, pushing its total holdings to 19.71 BTC, is more than just a transaction; it’s a statement. It reinforces the growing confidence among public companies in Bitcoin as a strategic asset and highlights the ongoing shift in corporate treasury management. As the digital economy continues to evolve, companies like Planet Ventures are paving the way for mainstream institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, setting a precedent for others to follow.

As the next market surge approaches, many wonder if ETH might finally outperform BTC. This article delves into the potential for Ethereum's rise and explores which cryptocurrencies are poised for significant growth. This analysis is delivered by Outset PR, a crypto communications agency that combines high-touch strategy with data-driven performance metrics. Ethereum Price Action: Poised for Potential Growth Source: tradingview Ethereum's price currently floats between two thousand six hundred and three thousand one hundred. The crypto has seen a near 18% bump in the last week, hinting at bullish momentum. Its ten-day moving average of just over three thousand matches its 100-day average, showing stability. With its RSI above 60, Ethereum isn’t in overbought territory, suggesting room for growth. If Ethereum breaks its nearest resistance at three thousand three hundred, it could climb to its second resistance near three thousand nine hundred—a growth potential of around 23%. However, it needs to stay above its support at two thousand three hundred to maintain momentum. Overall, signs point to possible positive movement ahead. Bitcoin Steadily Rises: Potential To Break Key Resistance Source: tradingview Bitcoin's price is riding a positive wave, oscillating between $111,000 and $122,000. It's witnessing strong upward momentum, with a significant climb of around 14.5% over the last month. Currently, it's only a modest leap away from surpassing a resistance point at $126,000. If BTC can break through this, the next strong point lies around $137,000. Such moves could represent a potential growth of around 13% from the current range. The current trends indicate healthy interest and possible further gains, with the market showing signs of bullishness. Enthusiasts are watching closely as Bitcoin inches towards new frontiers.

As traditional finance continues to embrace blockchain assets, Ethereum is emerging as more than just a decentralized platform—it’s becoming a key investment vehicle for major players. This institutional wave may not only validate Ethereum's long-term potential but also spark a broader rally across select altcoins poised to benefit from increased capital inflow. Ethereum on the Rise: Can It Surge Beyond $3360 Soon? Source: tradingview Ethereum's price is bouncing between $2644 and $3167. Recently, it's been gaining ground, with a notable climb of over 17% in the past month. The current plateau near $3167 suggests a tug-of-war between bullish hope and market caution. If momentum persists, it could test resistance around $3365 soon. Breaking past this might propel ETH towards the next hurdle at nearly $3888, marking a potential jump of about 19% from current highs. However, those watching its movements will note the strong safety net around $2318, preserving ETH's potential rise. Right now, all eyes are on whether this crypto giant can maintain its upward sprint or take a breather. Conclusion With Ethereum now in the spotlight of institutional finance, its near-term price action could reflect deeper shifts in market sentiment. A push past key resistance levels might attract further investment, while a pullback could offer entry points for bullish long-term positions. As major banks and funds expand their exposure, ETH isn’t just another asset—it’s fast becoming a bellwether for crypto’s next institutional era.

One name turning heads across the DeFi space is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently trading at just $0.03 in its presale’s fifth phase. This Layer-2 lending protocol is being built to blend real yield generation, automated risk controls, and a decentralized stablecoin system—all with just 27% of Phase 5 tokens left before a price hike to $0.035. With over $12.2 million raised and a fast-growing base of 13,200+ holders, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly gaining traction as the protocol with the most balanced utility and upside. While Binance Coin (BNB) consolidates its place in large-cap territory, MUTM is still early, offering multiple streams of ecosystem-driven yield and a launch price set at $0.06—double the current presale rate. Investors entering now are stepping in with a built-in 100% advantage before listing, with projections placing long-term growth closer to 15x as adoption scales. Binance Coin (BNB) Important Upgrade Binance Coin (BNB) surged past $700, gaining 2.5% weekly to reach $688.86 by July 12, 2025, driven by the Maxwell upgrade, which cut block times by 47% and boosted DEX volume to $5.8B, outpacing Solana. Institutional adoption, including NanoLabs’ $1B Binance Coin (BNB) acquisition plan and Binance Coin (BNB) Treasury’s U.S. stock exchange listing, fueled momentum. The Zero-Fee Carnival, extended to July 31, eliminated USDT/USD1 gas fees, enhancing user engagement. Technicals, with a rising 50-day moving average, support a bullish trend toward $720. Binance Coin (BNB)’s rally strengthens exchange tokens, potentially lifting CRO and OKB in crypto markets. In stocks, fintech firms may gain, but U.S.-BRICS trade tensions could spark volatility. In forex, a stronger dollar may cap Binance Coin (BNB)’s gains, yet its deflationary burn and ecosystem growth could drive sustained demand, positioning Binance Coin (BNB) as a top-tier asset. Layer-2 DeFi Lending with Multi-Directional Yield What will set Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart will be its two-pronged lending approach, optimized by Layer-2 scalability. The protocol will support peer-to-contract (P2C) lending for users seeking automated passive income, and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending for those who want direct control over terms and rates. This dual model will give both conservative and aggressive lenders a place in the ecosystem. P2C participants will be able to deploy major assets like DAI, USDC, BUSD, ETH, ADA, or SOL into high-yield pools with dynamic interest rates based on utilization. Each deposit will mint mtTokens—ERC-20 tokens that will reflect the user’s position and will accrue value automatically. These mtTokens will also be eligible for staking in Mutuum’s smart contracts, unlocking an additional revenue stream from protocol earnings. Consider a forward-looking scenario: a user who shifted $7,500 worth of Bitcoin (BTC) into MUTM during Phase 2 is now holding over $15,000 at Phase 5 pricing. With six more presale phases already planned before the public launch, that same allocation is expected to grow up to 15x in value by mid-2026 post launch. On the P2P side, the protocol will introduce a unique utility for meme coins like DOGE, SHIB, or PEPE. Lenders will be able to manually set terms and match with borrowers who use stable, blue-chip collateral like USDC or DAI. This model will open the door to broader participation while maintaining a secure, overcollateralized structure enforced by smart contracts. Stablecoin-Powered Treasury Growth and Staker Rewards Another standout feature driving attention toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its decentralized stablecoin system, designed to always maintain a $1 value and only be minted when users borrow against overcollateralized assets such as ETH. The stablecoin is burned upon loan repayment or liquidation, preventing supply inflation and preserving system integrity. Unlike typical algorithmic models, Mutuum’s stablecoin relies on governance-controlled interest rates rather than fluctuating supply-demand mechanics. These rates are adjusted to keep the stablecoin pegged to $1 — lowering borrowing costs when the price is above $1 and raising them when it drops below. Arbitrage incentives also help stabilize the peg. Minting is limited to approved issuers, each with a capped allowance to manage risk exposure. This design benefits long-term ecosystem participants. Users who stake mtTokens like mtBTC, mtUSDT, or mtETH into Mutuum’s safety module will receive dividend rewards in MUTM tokens, funded through protocol revenue and strategic buybacks. This structure links borrower activity, treasury growth, and investor returns in a self-sustaining cycle. The roadmap is structured to deliver key milestones such as beta launch, Layer-2 deployment, and multi-chain expansion. With a CertiK Token Scan score of 95.00, a Skynet score of 77.5, and a $50,000 bug bounty live with CertiK, technical credibility is well aligned. The project has also launched a $100,000 community giveaway and now boasts 12,000+ followers on X (Twitter)—momentum that signals rising mainstream attention. With only 27% of Phase 5 tokens remaining, investors are looking at the final opportunity to enter below $0.035. Once this milestone is crossed, the token heads toward its $0.06 listing—locking in an instant 100% return for Phase 5 buyers. This is the moment before the breakout.

The Musk-led rocket and satellite maker appears to be looking to cash in on investor confidence as part of its insider share sale. Elon Musk’s private aerospace juggernaut is expected to embark on an insider share sale that would value the company at roughly $400B, according to sources cited by Bloomberg . The jump to the $400B valuation is remarkable because SpaceX was pegged at $350B in its most recent share sale in December, and $210B just six months before that. The $400B valuation would also solidify the company’s status as the world’s most valuable private startup. SpaceX insider shares sale valued at $400B In the current deal, insiders can sell at $212 per share, up from the $185 price set in December. The offering is focused on employees and related insiders and involves approximately $1B worth of shares being put on the table. At this proposed valuation, SpaceX would rank among the most valuable companies in the S&P 500, ranking above giants such as Bank of America, Procter & Gamble, and many of its public aerospace competitors. The mechanics of SpaceX’s insider sales have drawn some scrutiny from well-connected private equity players, including Antonio Gracias and others. They have used special-purpose vehicles (SPVs) to channel investor interest, which also raised issues about preferential access and limited visibility, given the company’s private status. Investor confidence in Musk’s satellite maker is high Analysts stated that factors like Starlink’s explosive growth, SpaceX’s powerful market position, and robust financial backing are driving investor confidence in the company. The company also has a loyal base of early investors. A handful of Musk associates have previously orchestrated private share sales, including a billion-dollar deal involving both SpaceX and his AI company xAI . The satellite internet division has amassed over six million subscribers, and its 2024 revenues neared $2.7B that is now a major contributor to SpaceX’s projected $16B in its 2025 revenue. SpaceX now handles over half of global satellite launches and leads in government and national‑security contracts, including its Starshield division. The company holds more than $3B in cash, sparing it the need for dilutive capital raises. The $400B valuation doesn’t come without its challenges. The Starship rocket program, which is central to Musk’s ambitions for Mars colonization, has faced a series of setbacks, such as the major explosion at the Texas test site just last month. If Starship doesn’t become fully operational, SpaceX may struggle to shift entirely onto what it’s reusable, cost-cutting launch system.

Stablecoins, the digital assets pegged to fiat currencies, play a crucial role in providing stability and liquidity across these networks. Now, a significant development is set to transform the landscape of Bitcoin-centric finance: the cross-chain version of the USDT stablecoin, known as USDT0 , has officially integrated with Bitcoin L2 Rootstock. This isn’t just another technical update; it’s a pivotal moment that promises to unlock unprecedented utility and interoperability within the burgeoning BTCFi ecosystem. What Does This USDT0 Integration Mean for Bitcoin DeFi? The integration of USDT0 with Rootstock is a game-changer for several reasons. Previously, stablecoin usage on the Bitcoin network was limited, primarily due to Bitcoin’s native design, which prioritizes security and decentralization over smart contract functionality. Layer-2 solutions like Rootstock address this by adding a smart contract layer on top of Bitcoin, allowing for more complex applications, including DeFi protocols. By bringing USDT0 onto Rootstock, users gain a robust, liquid, and widely accepted stablecoin directly connected to the security of the Bitcoin blockchain. This move significantly enhances the capabilities of the BTCFi space, which aims to bring DeFi applications and services directly to Bitcoin holders. Imagine being able to lend, borrow, or provide liquidity using a stablecoin that is anchored to Bitcoin’s security. This integration makes that vision a reality, paving the way for a more vibrant and versatile financial ecosystem built around the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Understanding Rootstock: Bitcoin’s Smart Contract Powerhouse To fully appreciate the impact of this Stablecoin Integration , it’s essential to understand what Rootstock brings to the table. Rootstock (RSK) is a smart contract platform that is secured by the Bitcoin network through a process called merged mining. This means that Bitcoin miners can simultaneously mine Rootstock blocks without expending additional hash power, effectively extending Bitcoin’s security to Rootstock’s smart contracts. Here’s why Rootstock is crucial for Bitcoin’s DeFi ambitions: Bitcoin Security: Rootstock inherits the unparalleled security of the Bitcoin blockchain, making it a highly secure environment for DeFi applications. EVM Compatibility: Rootstock is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible, meaning developers can easily port existing Ethereum dApps and smart contracts to Rootstock with minimal changes. This dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for developers looking to build on Bitcoin. Scalability: As a Bitcoin L2 , Rootstock offers significantly higher transaction throughput compared to Bitcoin’s mainnet, making it suitable for DeFi operations that require faster and cheaper transactions. Decentralization: Rootstock maintains a high degree of decentralization, aligning with the core principles of Bitcoin and open finance. The ability of Rootstock to leverage Bitcoin’s robust security while providing a flexible smart contract environment makes it an ideal home for a major stablecoin like USDT0. Expanding Reach: USDT0’s Cross-Chain Dominance and What it Means for Stablecoin Integration USDT0 isn’t just any stablecoin; it’s a cross-chain iteration of Tether’s USDT, designed for seamless movement across multiple blockchain networks. Before this latest development, USDT0 had already established a significant presence across: Ethereum: The leading smart contract platform, home to a vast DeFi ecosystem. Arbitrum: A popular Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution, known for its efficiency. Optimism (OP Superchain): Another prominent Ethereum Layer-2, part of the growing OP Superchain network. Unichain: A lesser-known but active blockchain, demonstrating USDT0’s commitment to broad interoperability. This extensive multi-chain presence underscores USDT0’s commitment to liquidity and accessibility. The addition of Rootstock to this list is not merely an expansion; it’s a strategic move that brings the liquidity and widespread acceptance of USDT directly into the Bitcoin ecosystem. This Stablecoin Integration on a Bitcoin L2 opens up new avenues for capital efficiency and removes significant friction for users who want to utilize stable assets within BTCFi. The Rise of BTCFi: How Stablecoins Supercharge Bitcoin’s DeFi Future For years, Bitcoin has been seen primarily as a store of value. While its unparalleled security and decentralization are undeniable, its limited programmability has kept it somewhat separate from the explosion of DeFi innovation seen on platforms like Ethereum. However, with the advent of sophisticated Bitcoin L2 solutions like Rootstock, the narrative is rapidly changing. The concept of BTCFi is gaining serious momentum, aiming to unlock Bitcoin’s dormant capital for DeFi applications. The integration of a major stablecoin like USDT0 is a crucial catalyst for BTCFi’s growth. Here’s why: Enhanced Liquidity: Stablecoins provide a stable base for trading pairs, lending pools, and other financial instruments, attracting more capital into the BTCFi ecosystem. Reduced Volatility: Users can participate in DeFi activities without constant exposure to Bitcoin’s price volatility, making it more appealing for traditional finance participants and risk-averse users. New Use Cases: With stablecoins, Rootstock can host a wider array of financial services, including: Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) with stablecoin trading pairs. Lending and borrowing protocols using stablecoins as collateral or borrowed assets. Yield farming opportunities for stablecoin holders. Payment solutions leveraging the speed and low cost of Rootstock transactions. Broader Adoption: The familiarity and utility of USDT0 can attract a wider user base, including those who are new to DeFi or prefer stable assets. This development solidifies Rootstock’s position as a key player in the Bitcoin L2 landscape and a vital bridge for stablecoin liquidity into BTCFi. Challenges and Opportunities in the Evolving Bitcoin L2 Landscape While the USDT0 integration with Rootstock is a monumental step forward for BTCFi , it’s important to acknowledge the broader challenges and opportunities within the Bitcoin Layer-2 space. The ecosystem is still nascent compared to Ethereum’s DeFi landscape, and competition among various L2 solutions is growing. Challenges include: User Adoption: Educating users about the benefits and mechanics of Bitcoin L2s and encouraging them to migrate assets. Developer Ecosystem: Attracting more developers to build innovative applications on Rootstock and other Bitcoin L2s. Interoperability with Other Bitcoin L2s: Ensuring seamless asset transfer and communication between different Bitcoin scaling solutions as they emerge. Regulatory Clarity: Navigating the evolving global regulatory landscape for stablecoins and DeFi. However, the opportunities far outweigh the challenges. The sheer size and security of the Bitcoin network represent an enormous untapped potential for DeFi. With strategic Stablecoin Integration like USDT0 on Rootstock, the path is clear for Bitcoin to become a powerhouse not just as a store of value, but as a foundation for a robust, decentralized financial system. What’s Next for USDT0 and BTCFi? Actionable Insights This integration marks a new chapter for both USDT0 and the broader BTCFi movement. For users, it means new avenues for utilizing their stablecoin holdings directly within the Bitcoin ecosystem, without needing to bridge to other non-Bitcoin-secured chains. For developers, it signals a growing demand for DeFi applications on Bitcoin L2 solutions, particularly those that can leverage stablecoin liquidity. Here are some actionable insights: For Stablecoin Holders: Explore DeFi protocols on Rootstock that now accept USDT0. Look for opportunities in lending, borrowing, or providing liquidity to earn yield. For Bitcoin Enthusiasts: This is an excellent time to delve deeper into the capabilities of Rootstock and other Bitcoin L2s. Understand how these technologies are expanding Bitcoin’s utility beyond just being digital gold. For Developers: Consider building dApps on Rootstock. The EVM compatibility combined with the new stablecoin liquidity makes it an attractive environment for innovation in the BTCFi space. For Ecosystem Participants: Keep an eye on further Stablecoin Integration announcements and infrastructure developments within the Bitcoin Layer-2 ecosystem. The landscape is evolving rapidly. The synergy between a leading stablecoin and a secure, EVM-compatible Bitcoin Layer-2 creates a powerful foundation for the future of decentralized finance on Bitcoin. Conclusion: A New Era for Bitcoin and Stablecoins The integration of USDT0 with Rootstock is far more than a technical update; it’s a strategic alignment that fundamentally enhances the utility of Bitcoin. By bringing a widely used stablecoin directly onto a secure Bitcoin L2 , this development significantly bolsters the nascent BTCFi ecosystem. It promises greater liquidity, expanded use cases, and improved interoperability, paving the way for Bitcoin to become a more active and versatile player in the global DeFi landscape. This Stablecoin Integration is a clear signal that the future of finance is increasingly cross-chain, and Bitcoin is ready to claim its rightful place at the heart of this revolution. The journey has just begun, and the potential is immense.

According to the expert, a healthy bullish breakout above the $16 resistance is needed to trigger a rally. He added that he will continue to follow the intraday chart development tomorrow to spot the next scalp opportunity. LINKBTC Needs A Bullish Push To Unlock Momentum In the post, CRYPTOWZRD highlighted that the daily candles for both Chainlink and LINKBTC closed indecisively today, suggesting a temporary pause in momentum. While no strong push was recorded, the market remains on edge, awaiting a clear move, particularly from LINKBTC to confirm the next direction. Related Reading: Chainlink Holders Set Record As 1-Yr MVRV Signals ‘Opportunity’ He emphasized the importance of seeing more positive price action from LINKBTC. A bullish rally in the BTC pair could lay the foundation for a strong upside move in LINK itself. As the correlation between LINK and LINKBTC remains key, traders should keep a close eye on that pairing for early signals. Looking ahead, CRYPTOWZRD expects Chainlink to challenge the $16 daily resistance level. This price zone has become a critical threshold that, if breached, could trigger a more powerful impulsive move. A weakening Bitcoin dominance will also play a role in the scenario, potentially freeing up capital to rotate into altcoins like LINK. Should LINK break above the $16 resistance convincingly, CRYPTOWZRD anticipates a continued rally that may extend toward the $30 resistance area or even higher. The path toward this ambitious target would require sustained bullish sentiment and a supportive broader market environment. The analyst noted that his focus tomorrow will remain on tracking the lower time frame chart formation. This will allow him to identify potential scalp opportunities in real time, capitalizing on intraday volatility as the market defines its next major move. Waiting For Clear Market Sentiment Toward Chainlink In conclusion, the analyst highlighted that today’s intraday chart displayed a fair amount of volatility, signaling uncertainty in the short-term direction. Despite the turbulence, key levels continue to shape the outlook for Chainlink. Related Reading: Chainlink Bullish Signal Stands Firm, But Bitcoin Is Calling The Shots He emphasized that maintaining strength above the $15.85 intraday resistance target would be a positive development. It is likely to pave the way for the next leg up, with the $16.84 resistance target acting as the next area of interest for bulls. However, if price action slips further, the market may head toward the $14.40 support target. Given the current conditions, the analyst stressed the importance of waiting for market sentiment to mature before committing to new trades.

In an environment where volatility is the norm, such stability could signal strength rather than stagnation. This article unpacks the technical and market dynamics behind TON’s current position, exploring whether it’s primed for a breakout or merely biding its time. Toncoin Tests Limits with Steady Climb Toward Key Resistance Levels Source: tradingview Toncoin is showing signs of building momentum. Its price ranges from about $2.78 to $3.10. The nearest price hurdle it faces is at $3.23, while the supporting floor sits at $2.60. If momentum carries it past $3.23, it could aim for the next target at $3.55. Recent movements show a nearly double-digit increase over the past week, a small uptick for the month, but it's still down significantly over six months. The indicators suggest it's not in overbought territory, giving some room to grow. Prudent steps could push Toncoin higher, yet it has to clear these resistance levels for solid growth. Conclusion As Toncoin approaches key resistance levels, the market is watching for signs of a breakout or consolidation. Its recent uptick hints at brewing momentum, but a sustained move past $3.23 will be the real test. If bullish sentiment strengthens and resistance zones are cleared, TON may shift from underappreciated to outperforming—making now a critical moment for investors evaluating its potential.

Its price is $0.0013 in its Stage 4 presale. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) utilizes a Layer 2 solution optimized for meme tokens, combining the security of Ethereum with the speed of Solana. This is different from the main blockchain of $DOGE. It’s Meme Launchpad, a decentralized platform for releasing new currencies, creating a “meme factory” that encourages new ideas and community growth, which is superior to $DOGE’s tipping utility. Anti-sniper bot technology ensures that presales are fair, even when whales cause prices to fluctuate. Additionally, 0% buy/sell fees allow you to maximize your profits. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) incentivizes early adopters by allocating 26.5% of its 100 billion tokens to presale buyers and 13.5% to staking rewards. Analysts say that after raising more than $3.8 million, the price will be $0.1 by the fourth quarter of 2025, with a market valuation of $1 billion at $0.02 (15x). This is similar to how $DOGE’s price rose 18,500% from $0.004 to $0.74 in early 2021. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is an excellent choice due to its low starting point and promising technology. Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU): Community-Driven Solana Star Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain, priced at $0.01. It is linked to a successful NFT business that is branching out into toys, games, and IP licensing. $PENGU was launched in December 2024 with 88.9 billion tokens. It utilizes Solana’s fast and low-fee blockchain and has partnerships with companies such as Walmart and Lufthansa’s Miles & More program. If NFT and retail momentum pick up, analysts predict the price would rise by 42% to $0.014, with a target of $0.4 (40x). For $1,000, you can acquire 2,500 tokens, which are worth $ 1,000 at $0.40. This is better than $SOL’s 2x-3.4x. There are risks, such as token inflation and a weak NFT market, but $PENGU’s strong brand makes it a good bet for a supercycle. Dogwifhat ($WIF): Solana’s Viral Meme Powerhouse Dogwifhat ($WIF) is a meme coin based on Solana that rose 132.81% last month, making it a fan favorite. It is now worth $0.8. $WIF does well due to its humorous “dog with a hat” mascot and the fact that Solana transactions are highly rapid. Its market cap of $832 million is lower than that of $FARTCOIN, but there is a possibility for development, with analysts predicting a range of $5-$8 if Solana’s ecosystem continues to grow. $WIF is a risky investment because it is highly volatile and lacks practical applications in the real world. However, it has a lot of viral appeal and is listed on numerous exchanges, making it a high-reward bet for the supercycle. Floki ($FLOKI): Multi-Chain Utility Meme Coin Floki ($FLOKI) is worth $0.00007 and runs on Ethereum and BNB chains. It originated as a meme based on Elon Musk and has since evolved into a utility-driven project featuring Valhalla (NFT games), DeFi tools, and Floki University. Its market cap of $715 million and relationships with eSports teams, such as Nottingham Forest, help drive its growth. It went up 61.66% last month. Experts say 7x to 40x. $FLOKI features a multi-chain design and utility that reduces risk compared to pure meme coins, making it a strong candidate for the supercycle. Bonk ($BONK): Solana’s Community Champion At $0.0001, Bonk ($BONK) is Solana’s first meme coin, and it gives 50% of its coins to Solana users. Its market worth of $1.4 billion, which is up 54.89% from last month, indicates that the community is highly supportive and that it complements Solana’s DeFi, NFTs, and BonkSwap effectively. Analysts say that Solana’s expansion will push the price up to $0.0005 to $0.004 by 2026. There is a danger because $BONK lacks a defined roadmap, but its ecosystem and exchange listings (Binance, Coinbase) ensure it has liquidity and the potential for a supercycle. Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN): Solana’s AI-Driven Sensation At $1.17 with a market valuation of $1.1 billion, Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) beat out $BONK to become Solana’s third-largest meme coin. It increased from $0.003 to $2.74 by January 2025, primarily due to viral marketing and DEX listings. Analysts say it could drop to $0.2 and then rise to $5-$10 (4.3x-8.5x) by 2026. It lacks any AI applications and has a 90% chance of being incorrect, but the discussion surrounding it makes it a supercycle leader. Turbo ($TURBO): AI-Powered Meme Coin At $0.003, Turbo ($TURBO) is an Ethereum-based meme coin that uses AI to give trade alerts and create projects. It has gone up 69% recently. It’s a minor participant, but it has considerable potential. Analysts predict it may reach $0.05 if AI meme coins gain popularity. $TURBO’s AI utility makes it a speculative gem, but there are still risks associated with its execution. Toshi ($TOSHI): Base Chain’s Rising Star Toshi ($TOSHI) is a Base blockchain meme coin that costs $0.0005 and is named after the mascot of $SHIB. Analysts are looking at (40x-100x) by 2026 if Base keeps growing due to its community-driven strategy and minimal fees. There are dangers because $TOSHI is still new and lacks widespread adoption, but it might go viral and become a supercycle. Conclusion The supercycle of 2025–26 is going to kick off meme coins, and Little Pepe ($LILPEPE), Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU), Dogwifhat ($WIF), Floki ($FLOKI), Bonk ($BONK), Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN), Turbo ($TURBO), and Toshi ($TOSHI) are the best bets for 40x–100x gains. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) boasts impressive Layer 2 technology and $PENGU is garnering significant attention from the general public. $WIF, $FLOKI, $BONK, $FARTCOIN, $TURBO, and $TOSHI are all riding the wave of viral success.

WOW. Just came out of the @rstormsf trial (no phones allowed) and catching up on the House floor drama. The procedural vote on the crypto bills failed after a group of GOP Freedom Caucus members voted no — mostly, I’m told, over concerns about CBDCs and the bills not being… — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) July 15, 2025 Reports indicate that the vote fell apart after a group of House Freedom Caucus politicians voted no on the grounds that the crypto bills did not sufficiently address problems surrounding central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), along with other concerns. A successful vote would have largely been seen as a landmark moment for pro-crypto proponents as it included key legislation such as the GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act. Unclear How U.S. Lawmakers Will Move Forward After Shock Vote News of the failed procedural vote comes shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump called on Republican lawmakers to pass the digital asset bills in a Tuesday, July 15, Truth Social post. “This is our moment—Digital Assets, GENIUS, Clarity,” Trump wrote. “It is all part of Making America Great Again, BIGGER AND BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE.” “We are leading the World, and will work hard with the Senate and the House to get even more legislation passed,” he added. While Republicans are referring to the week of July 14 as “Crypto Week” on Capitol Hill, Democratic heavyweights have pushed back by also declaring this week as “Anti-Crypto Corruption Week.” In a July 11 notice posted on the House Financial Services Committee’s website, Ranking Member of the House Financial Services C ommittee Maxine Waters (D-CA) and Congressman Stephen Lynch (D-MA) claimed Republicans are trying to pass “dangerous pieces of crypto legislation.” “Aside from lacking urgently needed consumer protections and national security guardrails, these bills would make Congress complicit in Trump’s unprecedented crypto scam—one that has personally enriched himself, his entire family, and the billionaire insiders in his cabinet, all while defrauding investors,” Waters said. With the crypto bills currently stalled, it is still unclear how U.S. lawmakers will proceed.

A groundbreaking development is on the horizon, promising to bridge the gap between traditional equities and the burgeoning world of digital assets. The Bitcoin project Roxom is poised to launch a pioneering BTC-denominated stock exchange this September, a move that could fundamentally reshape investment strategies for crypto enthusiasts and institutional players alike. Imagine trading shares of your favorite companies, not with fiat currency, but directly with Bitcoin. This isn’t just a new platform; it’s a new paradigm. What is the Roxom BTC-Denominated Stock Exchange? At its core, the Roxom BTC-denominated stock exchange is a revolutionary platform designed to facilitate the trading of traditional company shares using Bitcoin (BTC) as the primary currency. Until now, investing in public companies typically involved converting your digital assets into fiat currency, navigating traditional brokerage accounts, and dealing with various intermediaries. Roxom aims to streamline this process by creating a direct bridge. As reported by CoinDesk, the platform’s vision is clear: to enable users to trade shares of companies that have significant exposure to Bitcoin, directly in BTC. This initiative isn’t merely about convenience; it’s about fostering a new ecosystem where Bitcoin isn’t just a speculative asset but a functional medium of exchange for real-world equity. The September launch marks a pivotal moment, opening up possibilities for investors who prefer to maintain their exposure to BTC while diversifying into equity markets. Why Trade Shares in BTC? Unpacking the Benefits The concept of using Bitcoin to trade shares in BTC might seem unconventional at first glance, but it offers a compelling suite of advantages for a specific segment of investors. For those deeply entrenched in the crypto economy, it eliminates several layers of complexity and cost associated with traditional trading: Direct Bitcoin Exposure: Investors can maintain their Bitcoin holdings without converting to fiat currency, preserving their BTC exposure while still gaining access to equity markets. This is particularly appealing for long-term Bitcoin holders. Streamlined Transactions: By removing the need for fiat conversions, the trading process becomes more efficient, potentially reducing transaction times and associated banking fees. New Investment Avenues: It unlocks a novel way for crypto investors to diversify their portfolios beyond purely digital assets, allowing them to invest in established companies that resonate with their crypto ethos. Reduced Counterparty Risk (Potentially): Depending on Roxom’s architecture, direct BTC settlement could minimize reliance on traditional banking systems, which can be prone to delays and geopolitical influences. Enhanced Accessibility: For individuals in regions with limited access to traditional financial services, a BTC-denominated exchange could offer a more inclusive pathway to global equity markets. This direct approach promises to simplify the investment journey for Bitcoin maximalists and those who see BTC as the future of finance. Companies with Significant Bitcoin Holdings: Who’s on the Radar? A key aspect of Roxom’s strategy is its focus on companies that have made substantial commitments to Bitcoin. The initial reports highlight names like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet . Why these companies? They represent a growing trend of publicly traded entities that have embraced Bitcoin as a treasury asset, often holding vast amounts of BTC on their balance sheets. MicroStrategy (MSTR): Led by Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy is arguably the most well-known corporate holder of Bitcoin. Their aggressive BTC acquisition strategy has made them a de facto Bitcoin ETF for many investors, allowing exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through a publicly traded stock. Trading MSTR shares directly in BTC on Roxom would be a natural fit for investors seeking pure Bitcoin-linked equity exposure. Metaplanet (3993.T): This Japanese company has recently gained attention for adopting a Bitcoin treasury strategy similar to MicroStrategy’s. Their move signifies a growing global trend of corporations diversifying their balance sheets with digital assets. Listing companies like Metaplanet on Roxom would provide a direct conduit for international investors to access these emerging Bitcoin-centric equities. Roxom’s selection criteria will likely favor companies whose fortunes are closely tied to Bitcoin’s performance, creating a unique investment class that appeals directly to the crypto community. Navigating the Crypto Stock Market: Opportunities and Challenges The emergence of a crypto stock market , exemplified by Roxom’s initiative, presents both immense opportunities and significant challenges. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for any potential participant. Opportunities: Market Expansion: It broadens the appeal of both Bitcoin and equity markets, attracting new demographics of investors. Innovation Catalyst: Roxom’s model could inspire further innovation in hybrid financial products, blurring the lines between traditional and decentralized finance. Liquidity Pools: As more capital flows into BTC-denominated equities, it could enhance liquidity in both the Bitcoin market and for the listed companies. Challenges: Despite the promise, several hurdles need careful consideration: Regulatory Landscape: The legal and regulatory framework for a BTC-denominated stock exchange is still evolving. Roxom will need to navigate complex international regulations concerning securities, digital assets, and cross-border transactions. Bitcoin Volatility: While the appeal is to maintain BTC exposure, the inherent volatility of Bitcoin means that the value of shares traded in BTC could fluctuate significantly, impacting both the share price and the purchasing power of the underlying BTC. Liquidity and Adoption: The success of the platform will heavily depend on attracting sufficient trading volume and a critical mass of users. Initial liquidity might be a concern. Security Risks: As with any crypto platform, robust security measures against hacks, scams, and operational failures will be paramount to building user trust. Roxom’s ability to address these challenges will dictate its long-term viability and impact on the broader financial landscape. How it Works: A Glimpse into Roxom’s Platform While specific technical details are yet to be fully revealed, the core mechanics of Roxom’s platform will likely involve a few key components: 1. Deposit and Wallet Integration: Users will likely deposit BTC into their Roxom accounts, which will function as integrated wallets. This Bitcoin will be used for all trading activities. 2. Order Book and Matching Engine: Similar to traditional exchanges, Roxom will operate an order book where buy and sell orders for company shares are matched. The prices will be quoted and settled in BTC. 3. Custody and Settlement: This is a critical area. Roxom will need a secure and transparent system for the custody of both the underlying shares and the Bitcoin. Settlement will occur directly in BTC, removing fiat intermediaries. 4. Compliance and KYC/AML: To operate legally, Roxom will undoubtedly implement Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures, ensuring regulatory compliance. The simplicity of direct BTC trading is the main draw, but the backend infrastructure must be robust and secure to inspire confidence. Actionable Insights for Investors If you’re considering engaging with Roxom’s BTC-denominated stock exchange once it launches, here are some actionable insights to keep in mind: Understand the Risks: Be acutely aware of Bitcoin’s volatility and how it can impact your equity investments. While you’re gaining exposure to stocks, your primary asset (BTC) remains volatile. Start Small: As with any new platform, consider starting with smaller investments to familiarize yourself with the interface, trading mechanics, and overall user experience. Due Diligence: Research not only the companies listed on Roxom but also Roxom itself. Understand their security protocols, regulatory compliance, and customer support. Portfolio Allocation: Decide how this new investment avenue fits into your overall portfolio strategy. Is it for diversification, or pure BTC exposure? Stay Informed: The regulatory and market landscape for crypto is dynamic. Keep up-to-date with news regarding Roxom, Bitcoin, and relevant financial regulations. The Future of Bitcoin Investments: A Paradigm Shift? Roxom’s upcoming launch is more than just another crypto platform; it represents a significant step towards the convergence of traditional finance and the decentralized economy. By allowing investors to directly trade shares in BTC , Roxom is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in investment. It legitimizes Bitcoin further as a medium of exchange and a unit of account for assets beyond just cryptocurrencies. If successful, Roxom could pave the way for other similar platforms, leading to a broader acceptance of crypto-denominated financial instruments. This could eventually lead to a truly global, permissionless financial system where digital assets play a central role in every aspect of investing, from bonds to real estate, all settled directly on blockchain rails. The journey has just begun, and Roxom is lighting a crucial path forward. The advent of a crypto stock market where you can seamlessly invest in equities using Bitcoin is no longer a futuristic dream but a tangible reality just weeks away. Roxom’s vision to launch a BTC-denominated stock exchange in September could indeed mark a revolutionary turning point for how investors approach both Bitcoin and traditional equities. By focusing on companies with significant Bitcoin holdings , Roxom is creating a niche yet powerful bridge between two distinct financial worlds. For those eager to trade shares in BTC , this platform offers an exciting and potentially transformative opportunity.

48312908,https://cryptonews.com/?p=382612,1752617478,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/48312908.jpeg,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 15 July – XRP, Pi Coin, Cardano",https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-price-prediction-today-15-july-xrp-pi-coin-cardano/,"Bitcoin, often dubbed the “crypto king,” has once again shattered expectations by hitting an all-time high price of $122,838 yesterday. This milestone has rapidly shifted trader sentiment into bullish territory. At the same time, a range of leading altcoins and the best meme coins —including TRON, Sui Network, Solana, Pepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin—have notched fresh peaks in recent months, reinforcing views that these sectors continue to offer strong upside potential. With expectations mounting for the next substantial bull market, investors are turning their focus towards select digital assets that could exceed their historical price ceilings. Ripple (XRP): Dominating Cross-Border Payments Crypto with Breakout Price Performance Ripple’s XRP is cementing its role as a key bridge between conventional banking systems and blockchain-powered remittance networks. Its ability to facilitate near-instantaneous global transfers with minimal fees has gained considerable institutional adoption. The United Nations has even acknowledged XRP as a viable tool for international fund transfers without relying on channels and intermediaries. After years of battling the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple scored a win in 2023 when the court ruled that XRP’s retail sales did not qualify as securities transactions. By 2025, the SEC formally dropped its lawsuit, concluding four years of legal uncertainty and securing the future of every major altcoin to boot. This resolution strengthened XRP’s regulatory position within the crypto industry, fueling investor confidence and driving its price up by more than 447% over the past year, compared to Bitcoin’s 88% rise during the same period. After encountering strong resistance around $3, XRP dipped 4% in the last 24 hours. We can observe additional selling from its overbought relative strength index, which sits at 74, indicating investors are now cashing in on Ripple’s ~30% rise over the last seven days, a rise which again pipped Bitcoin’s own. Earlier this year, the emergence of a bullish flag pattern across its support and resistance ranges suggested the possibility of a rally towards $3.50 this summer, potentially surpassing its previous peak of $3.40 set in January 2018. Pi Network ($PI): Can This Unique Mining Project Deliver 6x Gains by Summer’s End? Pi Network is transforming the mining environment with its innovative tap-to-mine model that negates the need for expensive mining rigs or high energy usage. Unlike conventional mining, Pi enables users to earn tokens simply by logging into its mobile application daily, substantially lowering the barrier to entry for crypto newcomers. Since its mainnet launch in February 2025, Pi Network has witnessed explosive growth. In early May, its native token $PI soared by 171% within four days—rising from $0.58 to $1.57—indicating strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Currently, it trades at around $0.45. The token’s RSI sits at 36 and is trending downward, suggesting a selloff is happening that will discount the price in the coming days. So, it’s the perfect time to buy in if you believe in Pi Network’s potential. See, the steep falling wedge observed between March and April presages a breakout that could propel $PI beyond the $3 level if market conditions remain favourable through summer. With its user-friendly design and proprietary Layer 1 blockchain, Pi Network is positioning itself as a formidable player in the next wave of global crypto adoption. Cardano ($ADA): Is This Eco-Friendly Ethereum-Challenger Crypto Set to Hit New Price Highs in 2025? Interest in Cardano ($ADA) is growing, supported by increasing institutional support and robust technical indicators. Alongside XRP and Solana, Cardano was recently pointed out by Donald Trump as a potential candidate for inclusion in a proposed U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Founded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson in 2014, Cardano is widely respected for its academic research-led development framework and its energy-efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus, which inspired Ethereum’s own shift from Proof-of-Work to PoS. With a current market capitalisation of $26.7 billion, ADA would need to more than triple in price to surpass Solana and rival Ethereum’s dominance. Over the seven days, Cardano outperformed Bitcoin during the broader market rally, gaining 25.5% compared to Bitcoin’s 8.1% increase. Forecasts suggest ADA could rise from its current $0.74 price to nearly $2 by mid-year, with more optimistic projections indicating a full recovery to its previous high of $3.09, representing a recovery from its 75.5% drop since it hit that benchmark in September 2021 in the midst of crypto’s blistering bull run. While a bullish flag pattern between November and April signals further upward potential, ADA’s RSI briefly moved into overbought territory at 72 yesterday, prompting some short-term profit-taking that is building up selling mometum, leading to a 2.9% drop in price in the last 24 hours. The next major resistance lies at $1.15, with solid support observed between $0.85 and $0.90. Snorter ($SNORT): Early Presale Opportunity in a Promising Meme-Trading Hybrid Spotting promising crypto projects before mainstream adoption often yields the largest gains. While established altcoins continue to dominate, new tokens are forging innovative paths for growth. One such emerging project is Snorter ($SNORT) , a hybrid meme token and trading bot built on Solana, with cross-chain expansion in its roadmap. Snorter integrates directly into Telegram, offering instant market insights within chat groups. Boasting transaction fees as low as 0.85%, it offers a cost advantage over competitors like BonkBot, Maestro, and Trojan. Its platform features MEV-protected swaps, copy trading capabilities, anti-rug pull systems, and limit order sniping, providing traders with a comprehensive toolkit. Investor interest has accelerated, with the presale raising over $1.8 million so far. Its staking program offers yields of up to 205% APY, rewarding early participants generously. Whether you’re an experienced trader or exploring meme coins for the first time, Snorter is positioning itself as a versatile platform to navigate the fast-paced crypto market.

48312909,https://cryptonews.com/?p=382721,1752617490,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/48312909.jpeg,"China’s DeepSeek AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Solana and Cardano by the End of 2025",https://cryptonews.com/news/chinas-deepseek-ai-predicts-the-price-of-xrp-solana-and-cardano-by-the-end-of-2025/,"China’s AI language model (LLM) DeepSeek predicts numerous leading altcoins could smash past previous highs by late 2025, following Bitcoin’s explosive upward trajectory. Yesterday, Bitcoin hit a new record price of $122,838, and has since retreated a modest 4.9% in 24 hours as it consolidates its newfound territory. This powerful rally has ignited optimism across the digital asset market, with analysts now suggesting a historic bull run, potentially surpassing the legendary 2021 cycle, may be in motion. DeepSeek AI has pointed out several top altcoins that could see unparalleled valuations under these conditions. Below are the cryptocurrencies that DeepSeek AI predicts could deliver substantial near-term gains. Ripple ($XRP): China’s DeepSeek AI Predicts This Cross-Border Giant Could Potentially Double DeepSeek AI’s latest outlook places Ripple’s XRP on an aggressive upward path, forecasting a potential climb to $5 before the year ends—a little under double its current value near $2.90. Several factors underpin this forecast: Ripple’s decisive win over the SEC, accelerating institutional integration, and speculation around a possible XRP spot ETF approval in the US. The United Nations Capital Development Fund has endorsed XRP’s speed, low fees, and compliance, cementing its role in global remittance solutions. Ripple’s prolonged legal battle concluded in March after the SEC withdrew its lawsuit, following a 2023 ruling clarifying that XRP’s retail sales were not securities transactions. This regulatory clarity has strengthened investor trust. Currently trading at $2.90, XRP’s next resistance lies at $3. Should it clear this level, DeepSeek AI anticipates a potential rally to $5 by late 2025, although should we be witnessing the start of a bull run, DeepSeek may have to adjust its calculations, because XRP bulls would target $15 in explosive market conditions. Technical charts reveal a bullish flag pattern from January to April, indicating strong upward momentum. However, with its RSI at 79, a short-term pullback is likely as traders lock in profits over the weekend. Over the past year, XRP has gained 453%, outpacing Bitcoin more than fivefold during the same period. Solana ($SOL): DeepSeek AI Predicts This High-Speed Blockchain Will Quadruple in Value Solana ($SOL) continues to strengthen its position as a leading smart contract network, second only to Ethereum in decentralized app deployment and user engagement. With a market capitalisation exceeding $86.4 billion, SOL remains a top choice among developers and institutional buyers. Investor sentiment is rising on hopes of a Solana spot ETF approval in the US, mirroring capital inflows seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Furthermore, discussions around adding SOL to a proposed US digital asset reserve are enhancing its institutional profile. Technically, Solana has reversed its downtrend. After sliding from January highs above $250 to near $100 in April, SOL has broken out from a descending wedge pattern, a strong bullish indicator, and now trades around $161. DeepSeek AI projects SOL could hit $600 by year-end, more than doubling its former peak of $293.31 set in January. A robust summer rally could push SOL towards $300 by autumn, with further gains towards $600 by the end of 2025. Under optimal conditions, particularly if a broad industry bull run unfolds or if supportive US crypto legislation materialises, prices in the $750–$1,000 range are also feasible, potentially ushering in the next growth phase for the sector. Cardano ($ADA): China’s DeepSeek AI Predicts This Eco-Friendly Blockchain Could 10x Cardano ($ADA) recently caught attention from U.S. President Donald Trump, who floated the idea of including ADA in a Strategic Crypto Reserve on his Truth Social platform. While his proposal suggested direct government Bitcoin purchases, government Cardano acquisitions would only occur through seized funds. Still, the mention in itself is indicative of Cardano’s clout in the industry. Founded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano has built its reputation on research-backed development, scalability, and sustainability. With a market cap of $23.7 billion, ADA stands as a formidable Ethereum competitor and is catching up rapidly to high-growth blockchains such as Solana. DeepSeek AI predicts ADA could reach $7 by year-end, representing nearly a tenfold surge from its current $0.7367 valuation. Technically, ADA has been consolidating within a descending wedge since late 2024. A breakout above its $1.10 resistance could trigger a short-term rally to $1.50 by fall. Even if a full-fledged bull run does not materialise, surpassing DeepSeek’s conservative 2025 target of $3.50 would see ADA exceeding its previous record high of $3.09. TOKEN6900: Could This New Meme Coin Deliver 1000x Returns? While China’s DeepSeek AI predicts robust growth from leading altcoins, their gains remain constrained by large market caps. For traders targeting outsized returns, a new breed of meme tokens is emerging with exponential potential. One such project is TOKEN6900 (T6900) , an ERC-20 meme coin that launched its presale last week. Hey Siri, define aura pic.twitter.com/NVYT1pZmed — Token6900 (@Token_6900) July 8, 2025 So far, TOKEN6900 has raised over $543,350, reflecting strong early investor interest and promising post-listing prospects. Unlike other meme coins moving towards utility, TOKEN6900 proudly embraces its purely hype-driven identity, combining irony, aggressive marketing, and FOMO to build traction. The project’s website declares: “It’s Not Built On Fundamentals. It’s Built On Delusion, Irony, And The Collective Hallucination Of Terminally Online Traders.” TOKEN6900 also references SPX6900, another meme coin styled after the absurdist themes of the late-90s tech bubble. Its total supply stands at 930,993,091 tokens – precisely one token more than SPX6900 during its presale, reinforcing its competitive branding strategy. This approach appears to be working, as reflected in its swift fundraising progress. Although the token lacks utility, staking mechanisms provide additional income streams alongside price speculation.
